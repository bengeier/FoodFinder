{"text":"Dined here for Restaurant Week, Spring 2017.

Gigli - fresh pasta, but nothing special. There isn't anything wrong with simple, but the flavors in this dish did not really stand out. This seemed like fresh pasta with canned sauce.

Mushroom 'Pasta' - the flavors did not settle into the mushrooms. Overall, bland.

Tiramisu - solid flavors

Sangria was too plain, martini was very strong (which was of course, absolutely fine).
Veal meatballs were juicy, but were not very flavorful

Out of the whole experience, I enjoyed the polenta and tiramisu the most.

Two star food experience, Five star service experience."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It was not only excellent quality food, but very innovative. I had been warned it was pricey with small portions -- that was bad info. Friends from out of town had heard of it and wanted to go, so I arranged for a group of 12. We asked our server to make some selections, and I made clear I had heard it was pricey, so don't break the bank. We ate family style. The food was Fantastic. Great wine. We all had plenty to eat, and I was surprised it was significantly less than the bill for the same group at Mastro's a few nights before. I wonder if my server can remember us and tell me what he selected for us?"}
{"text":"I think the only thing I'll remember about Fat Ox is the noise level.  Yet another restaurant where you can't have a conversation with those at your table.  The food was mediocre and expensive.  Five of us had the same reaction in that we don't need to hurry back to Fat Ox.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place...have tried it a few times now and I just can't go back for dinner. Maybe drinks.  The portions are tiny and I haven't found anything that's really memorable / \"craveable\".
The caesar might be one of the best things and it's nothing special (plus it's lettuce).  The burrata is literally 2 teaspoons of cheese floating in a bowl, really strange presentation and absolutely ridiculous portion. The casoncelli pasta is actually really good but it is 6-7 pieces of pasta lined up on a plate.  Entrees were really expensive for what you get and none of the meat or the salmon that I've tasted has been memorable. Disappointing."}
{"text":"OK, the atmosphere was nice, a great bar scene, and the bartender, Tony, was great too.  This place has a good Friday night vibe, if not a little too noisy in the dining area.   The service in the dining room was good too, with the waiter and staff being attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.   And, the waiter did warn us that the portions were small.   I guess, given the healthy prices, I didn't think he meant THAT SMALL.   The pasta dishes were tasty, but very small.   I mean really, really small plates.  Specifically, the Casoncelli and Garganelli.   What really turned me off on this place though was the entree I ordered, the Costata.   This is a $65.00 grilled ribeye steak.   The menu says it is 18 oz.   It was not even close to that size.   Much smaller.  It came sliced up and was dressed up with peppers and onions, but it was a very small amount of edible meat.  There was a meatless bone, and the slices of beef were absurdly fatty.   I understand a ribeye can be a little fatty and that is part of why it tastes good, but this was way too fatty for my taste.   Bottom line, the food tastes good, but this place is way too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"A restaurant has to go above and beyond in this competitive market with so many talented, chef- driven dining places available.  We eat out often and were eager to experience Fat Ox, as we love their sister place, The Mission.  I must say, it has been a quick expansion for this restaurant team; servers are not trained as well as before, chefs don't always get it right as they once did, even at our beloved Mission.  Having said all that, my salmon dish was good, nothing special. My husband's pork offering was a large serving, but not memorable. Our guest liked his scallops, and his wife said her salmon was good. The broccoli rabbe was too salty to eat, the waiter had few social skills, and did not apologize for the broccoli or another wrong order. The gelato was excellent.  The old Quilted Bear has been enlarged and modernized, so the space is open and appealing.  After discussing our food experience as we drove home, we agreed it wasn't a place to which we'd return. There are just too many really superb places to dine. We will try a new one, or happily return to our old favorites."}
{"text":"Big Daddy and I had a wonderful date night Saturday at Fat Ox. We have enjoyed Chef Matt's other ventures- The Mission and Zinc Bistro for years. This was a completely different experience and we also loved it. The atmosphere almost made you feel as if you were in San Francisco or somewhere else wonderful. Beautiful space, open air, all of it. Jennifer and Anthony made our dining experience excellent. Attentive, yet not hovering, allowing us to take our time and enjoy the experience.
Anthony made a great table side caesar that we shared. It was delicate and delicious. The white anchovies made it really special. My hubby does a great caesar and this one has him beat.
We next enjoyed the white truffle, speck garganelli. SWOON! Absolutely lick your spoon delicious. 
We also enjoyed the Filet with the Porcini sauce. It was appropriately crispy on the outside, mid rare inside (perfect) and we loved it. 
We  were too full for dessert. 
We felt it was the most enjoyable meal out in a very long time and will be back. We will try a whole new set of tastes next time."}
{"text":"Amazing Experience. The restaurant fully met our expectations. For the people that say it's expensive; continue your Italian experiences at Olive Garden. I'd honestly pay $200 for the Dry Aged Porterhouse. Explore this menu without caution, you won't be disappointed. Chef on, FatOx."}
{"text":"Ridiculously high priced.  Ridiculously small portions.  Ridiculously contrived menu items.  My husband and I, and two friends, dined at Fat Ox recently.   We spent $400 with only 3 glasses of wine, and left hungry!.   We were excited to dine at Fat Ox, being fans of The Mission, Zinc Burger and House Brasserie.    We arrived a few minutes early, and were asked to wait because they didn't have any menus!  The front reception area is chaotic, and the staff, of whom there are many, don't know what is going on.  Once seated, we ordered the Caesar salad.  The flavor was OK, but the portion size was tiny - 4 lettuce leaves.  We ordered a couple of pastas for the table, the tortellini and another pasta stuffed with salamis, etc.  When the orders arrived, our guests burst out laughing - they thought it was a joke.  5 teeny tiny tortellini. Flavors were bland.  The main courses were equally small, and, sadly, quite tasteless.  My husband ordered the 7 oz filet, which wasn't even 4 oz.  The scallops were an appetizer size.  The veal was a decent portion, but shockingly undercooked.   The bread basket consisted of large croutons.  When we asked for me, the server told us we would have to pay extra!  Yikes!!  Don't go!!!"}
{"text":"My rating of this restaurant is a 4.0 for the taste of the food, a 4.0 for ambience, but a 2 for portion size, price, disjointed menu/courses, and misleading information on service (described below).  My husband and I went with another couple and we ended up sharing the food (apps and main course) at the recommendation of the server.  First they brought delicious bread bites to the table. We ordered the burrata app and 3 pastas (the Garganelli was def the best) which we ordered first. Since we ordered 4 dishes, we all decided we would wait to see how we felt before deciding on our entres; plus, we wanted to take it slow and not be rushed. Prior to bringing our apps/pasta, the servers came to our table several times asking us what we wanted to order for our entres.  Although we told them we wanted to wait, one of the servers told us if we didn't put our orders in at that point, we would have to wait about 1 1/2 hours for the entres to come.  Although we still wanted to wait, he pressured us and we decided we would order. The server recommended we order the 18 ounce porterhouse to split in addition to another entre since we were all interested in some steak. Instead, we ordered the 18 ounce rib eye and the 7 ounce fillet thinking that would be plenty in light of all of the food we had already ordered.  Within 5 minutes of putting in our entre order, they brought the apps/pasta.  The apps/pasta were excellent but the portion sizes were very small, especially for the price. We each got about 2 tablespoons of each dish and finished them quickly; within 20 minutes our entres came, despite being told we would have a 1 1/2 hour wait if we chose to order the entres after we finished the apps/pasta.  The two steaks were plain with no sides and didn't take long to finish. When we did finish, the men were still hungry but because they felt somewhat misled, we decided to leave. The check, which includes a total of 5 alcoholic beverages, came to $300.00. Although we had a fun time together and the food was good, when all was considered, we agreed afterwards that we probably would not return.  Several other Italian places with really good food and less expensive."}
{"text":"greeting staff was terrific, decor well done, noise level is far too high to be able to communicate at our table. service time very slow, meals not served at the same time.
food was ok, expensive and very small portions. no one was happy with our dinner.
i have spoken to several other friends who had similar poor experiences at this restaurant.
we expected better.

lots of great restaurants around"}
{"text":"Went for the soft open and was blown away. The atmosphere is unbelievable but the food is what I will remember.  Pasta dishes were cooked perfectly and my skirt steak rivaled any steak I've ever had. Cat wait to go back. Well done."}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing birthday dinner at Fat Ox! The food was to die for (my favorite was the green tortellini). The ambience and decor is wonderful, and the service was truly over the top. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you get the chance, ask for James. He was knowledgeable on the menu, offering his favorites & I'm thankful we listened to his suggestions. We did a family style & had a little of everything. The veal meatballs, insalata di casa, and linguine were amazing. Also, if you have rude dinner guests you're just meeting for the first time, James is gracious AF & doesn't blink an eye."}
{"text":"Excited to try this restaurant. Disappointed.  Decor terrific. Noise level outrageous, I left hoarse. Shared mussels...small portion for 2. Caesar salad shared. Very crisp but not tasty enough. Two orders of pasta. Very small portions. Mine was too salty to eat. Waiter, who was very attentive, offered to replace but turned him down. Comped a glass of wine. Tiramisu just  OK.  Wanted this place to be great but noise level alone will keep me away. My companion said it was pricey for what weI had."}
{"text":"My wife and I were recommended this restaurant as a place to try while in town from D.C.  We had a really great experience start to finish. The interior of the restaurant is open but still feels intimate. The cocktail list and wine selection was great. And, the only thing better than the outstanding food was the service. Josh and Aaron took care of us and they really made the evening perfection. They were very knowledgeable about the menu as well as the wine offerings, ensured smooth and seamless service, and never failed to have a smile and engaging demeanor each time each approached the table.

Great meal, great experience, great service!!  Thanks to Josh, Aaron and the rest of the Fat Ox team for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant but very over priced for what you get. Only sat at the bar and was very disappointed in the food options. I'll probably go back, just not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place..from the service, drinks and the Food. If you want a great dinning experience with quality food enjoy the Fat OX"}
{"text":"Our dinner here was so good , great to be exact .  Portions not overwhelming and prepared perfect.  We will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Their statement is \"extremely small portion size to share at ridiculous prices.\"  The prices are crazy and portions are for a toddler. The chef wants the customers to \"share\" their tiny portioned food?! My dinner companion's seafood entree was undercooked and rubbery. I hope he didn't get ill. The place is very loud! The tables are close together like in New York City restaurants and hard to hear your dinner companions so you have to raise your voice (while the tables next to you eavesdrops)! Save your money and go elsewhere for fine dining."}
{"text":"We have been here before for enjoyable dinners and drinks.  Its ambiance contributed to our decision to celebrate a very special wedding anniversary here.  Tamara, the events coordinator, made sure we had a very special table that was intimate.  AJ, our server, went over the top on making sure we were taken care of in every way.  We started with Prosecco and the mozzarella di bufala with charred radichio.  It took us back to Treviso in Italy.  My husband got Rosso crest di gallo (cock's comb pasta) with duck.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the flavor was wonderfully rich. I got the cosoncelli pasta.  Beautiful little pasta purses filled with butternut squash.  It could of used a little sauce or butter but if you want to have a pasta primi and a meat secondi, this is the way to go without filling up extremewise.  My husband then had the 25 oz bistecca fiorentina (Italian steak).  The sear on the steak took us back to eating with Dario Cecchini in Panzano Chianti.  I ordered the short rib alla vacinara.  Some of the most tender fall off the bone meat ever.  All of this went so well with the wonderful Italian wines they have on the wine list.  One of the most wonderful surprises were all the amazing vegetable side dishes they kept bringing to the table free of charge.  I could have just eaten the vegetables.  For the desert they provided us with tiramisu but I just had to have the pistachio gelato also.  We were there for at least three hours, just like we would dine in Italy.  Matt Carter, Brian Raab and Mark Drinkwater have done it again!"}
{"text":"I first visited Fat Ox for a work dinner recently and had the 25 Layer Lasagna which was fantastic and had to put this on my list of must-go restaurants. Brought a colleague in for dinner tonight and enjoyed a Chef's Board and the Green Tortellini. The Chef's Board was delicious, however, I think I'll stick with the 25 Layer Lasagna for future visits. Our waitress, Amanda, was absolutely spectacular. The service was top-notch, our drinks were never empty, and our food was prompt to our table. Definitely looking forward to returning again soon!"}
{"text":"Before Fat Ox's much acclaimed open, I called for a reservation for my party of 8. A few days before our dinner, I personally went to the Fat Ox and requested the large table in the back room as it was quieter. I also told the hostess when she called to confirm my reservation that I wanted the back room. Arriving on time for our reservation, our party was given a table in the noisy bar area. Although they were able to give us a table that was located more in the dining room, it was not what I requested not once, not twice, but three times. We were off to a shaky start.
As far as the food...we were encouraged by our server to do a family style way of dining on the different courses. The four women of the group decided on our first course of a caeser salad. It was too lemony for my liking, as I enjoy more of a parmesan taste. The second course was the Casoncelli and Strozzapreti. As far as the family style of sharing, the four of us could have two tablespoons of Casoncelli (butternut squash) and two pasta noodles on the Strozzapreit (pasta and tomato sauch). Our entree that 3 of us split (one woman had the ligunine and clams, double portion as an entree) was the Skirt Steak Tagliata, which was presented pre sliced. We could each have two slices, one tablespoon of polenta and a two tablespoons of mushrooms. They were out of our requested tiramisu and comped us some other deserts. 
The food is delicious; however the servers need to be clearer with their portion size. And to leave the restaurant feeling full, you will pay for that feeling. For the four of us, our caeser was $34, second course was $30 and the entrees were $38 and $36. 
Will we come back? After the problem with the table, it's a bitter pill to swallow. But the food is delicious, but more managable if you go just as a couple portion-wise. ALso, if you are with a group, don't expect to hear anyone at the opposite end of the table. This place is busy and noisy."}
{"text":"The place is modern.  The food was good but way over priced. I kiddingly asked the server if they had a layaway plan which must have rubbed her the wrong way because I never saw her again.  The portions are very small and drinks are double the price of other restaurants. LA type establishment with LA prices. With so many good restaurants in town I don't expect this one to last."}
{"text":"Apparently this is a new restaurant in the Scottsdale area. They serve fresh pasta, make a great Caesar salad right by your table with white anchovies, serve excellent cocktails but the best part is the atmosphere. Let me just say that the people of Scottsdale are an eclectic bunch. There's a lot of money in Scottsdale and a lot of plastic surgery."}
{"text":"I dined here last night for the first time. Came in with no expectations & was extremely surprised & pleased with the whole experience. Right away, the manager/host Darvay (probably butchered the name, sorry!) greeted my boyfriend and I at the door by name, ready to take us to our table. We were seated at a pleasant corner table in the back. Our server Canton was amazing. He knew the menu inside & out, as well as drinks & wine. We started off with two tequila/mezcal cocktails & then asked him about switching to a bottle of wine. He recommended a very nice 2005 red blend called Arcanum. We ordered the burrata & the prosciutto to start, then had the ricotta pasta with rabbit tenderloin which was incredible. We then had the 18oz ribeye, the half Jidori chicken with polenta(amazing), & the short rib alla vaccinara(something like that). We ended the evening with two shots of Avion tequila & dessert! We had the tiramisu which had a chocolate mousse like chocolate base, on the side was an espresso ice cream & these chocolate crunchy balls on the side. We also tried the pistachio Gelato which was so good and I'm not very into pistachio ice cream. Every dish was super unique & delicious. My two favorites were the pasta & the short rib. The restaurant itself is beautiful & I will be back. Not your typical italian restaurant...in my opinion it is much much better. Go try it out & request Canton!! He will make your experience amazing!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here just before Christmas and wasn't impressed.

Portions were weak, way overpriced and lighting was too dim.

Plus it was way too loud.

Facebook was right about this place. Will stay w/ Village Inn or Buca Di Beppo for the time being."}
{"text":"Was in town for business and we came for dinner. The acoustics were so bad, we couldn't hear each other at the table. Service was friendly but slow. Food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Overrated.....

Beautiful design, decor, and atmosphere.  Service was very lack luster and food was very weak for the price.  Manger was very nice and appreciated the feedback however not sure if we will be back or not."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and the service is exceptional. Certainly a 3.5 star \"diamond in the rough!\" I can't wait to dine here again!"}
{"text":"I found our experience at Fat Ox to be a mixed bag. The highlight is really the restaurant itself . The decor and the ambiance is fantastic. Clean and modern. The bar area is very well done. As for the food, the Rigatoni Lamb Verde is outstanding, the meats and cheeses are ok, the short rib was very good, and the scallops were good as well.

There are some low lights though... The place is very loud, the prices are up there (our dinner for 4 came in at close to $400 (without the wine)), the portions are small, and the desserts are  mediocre (our lemon tart lacked any lemon flavor). 

Overall, would I eat here again? I am not really sure. I love the look and feel, but I was not really taken in by food. 

N*joy..."}
{"text":"Everything was beautiful and delicious. We had the lamb verde, swordfish and scallops to name a few. The atmosphere is nice with patio options. The guys in our group enjoyed the mens bathroom art."}
{"text":"Food, ridiculous!!! 

This is my style of dining, European. Cocktail list is diverse, wine list expansive. 

The pasta was especially tasty. (Pro-tip; it's not an entree.)

The manager, (Darvey?) stopped by with genuine interest in our experience. 

BONUS: female chefs!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly well done addition to the Scottsdale dining scene.  Thank you to the chef for fitting us in without a reservation.   Only a week after opening they have done a nice job on the menu, the ambiance, and the service.  Our server, Timo did an outstanding job introducing us to the menu, specialties, an experience of Fat Ox.   Volume amps up when the place gets full, so be prepared for a vibrant environment.  

Definately a winner in a crowded field.  We will definately be back."}
{"text":"The pasta was cold, the staff was uninterested in us, very expensive for the effort.  Tried three times and all three were not good experiences."}
{"text":"The food was exquisite, absolutely phenomenal.  We're in town for a week and are planning a second visit tomorrow or the next day because our first was so good. I highly recommend the pasta, we ordered two and they were both exceptional as we're the mussels and ricotta. One of the best Italian meals I have had outside of Italy."}
{"text":"There was a very rude employee that almost knocked me over when we were standing at the bar that didn't even apologize so that was a horrible first impression but once we were seated by the very friendly hostesses...the combination of our table location and Cantenn's IMPECCABLE service completely made our evening perfect!!  He is quite possibly the best server any of us have ever had!!  We loved him!  He enjoys what he does and it was evident that he loved making our dinner experience the best he could make it.  Besides the awful employee that was serving at the bar...you are so lucky to have other employees that truly care for your customers."}
{"text":"Cantenn made the experience. Yes that's his name, and he saved the day.
-great food
-ambiance is spot on
-good craft cocktails 
-staff is spot on

Front end needs help. Host/hostess"}
{"text":"I have the first start off by saying this is no Olive Garden nor is it your traditional Italian restaurant is it expensive well depends on what you order because this is more of a Italian Steakhouse the pasta dishes are meant to be as an appetizer and there's steak and fish are your entree so $17 for a pasta dish is a good price but it's not going to feel you you up by itself I started off with a tableside Caesar salad it's probably the greatest Caesar salad I've ever had just a sharpness of the dressing and it's just amazing flavor don't think about it it's not a true tableside Caesar salad which I was disappointed in so no making the dressing from the scratch it's already made but still really good next I had to steam mussels with the tomato sauce I have to say that was probably one of the top 10 greatest dishes I've ever had in my life the muscles we're cooked perfectly or maybe was the quality of them don't know they were fantastic but the tomato sauce they were in was undescribable it took every ounce of restraint not to drink the sauce out of the bowl I want some right now as I'm writing this this is the number one thing you need to get second thing was that rigatoni lamb Verde which was really good too love to pesto that was in make sure taste buds scream third thing was a squid ink pappardelle that was just okay didn't care for the sauce or the pasta I would skip the next time not much to say about that for my dinner I have a short rib alla vaccinara it was pretty good nice and tender the sauce I was with it was pretty good not real sweet and sour thing just well-balanced for the dish almost like a bordelaise sauce but not really and the finish it off are the best Tiramisu I've ever had headache chocolate ganache bottom with the tiramisu and I'm not a fan now for the service was all on point as well super friendly you everything about the menu I don't eat pork so they had to been changed for me this is what you pay this kind of money for if I can get more five stars I would most excellent experience and food so next time skip Mastro's or any of those nice steakhouses then try them instead definitely won't be disappointed so I will be going back for sure"}
{"text":"For meat eaters this is a huge 5 star find. We had six people and each a different dish. We taste tested each other's dishes and 100% were 5 star."}
{"text":"Spectacular. One of the best meals I've ever had. Great service. Great food. Great cocktails. Great atmosphere. Nothing not to love. And I was there with two little kids. Still a great experience.  I cannot recommend this place enough. Yes, it's expensive. But you can taste the quality in the food. You can see the quality in the service. Do yourself a favor: make a reservation."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in the Valley. The Bistecca is incredible (4 of us polished off the medium rare 40 oz option with no problem both times I've been in for dinner). The butternut squash ravioli is amazing and the garganelli is INCREDIBLE. Definitely do it family style, course by course. We started with the mussels and chefs meat board (ask for extra prosciutto, you won't be sorry), then chose 3-4 pastas, then the bistecca which comes with a mashed cheesy polenta. The wine list is great and the service is impeccable. Can't go wrong with any cocktail (although I wish they served the Old Fashioned with one block ice cube, it watered down quickly). The portions are small because it's meant to be served together with other options family style. If you order one of the pasta dishes only and expect to be full, you'll be disappointed - but you'll also be doing it wrong. It's not cheap, but it is more than worth it!! Expect to be rolled out - fat and happy."}
{"text":"Was here NYE, I wouldn't say it was perfect but heck they have only been open a month. The staff was over the top nice and attentive. The 4 course NYE menu was slow to the table but I was with an amazing lady and the food was great and the way it was presented was very artistic. No real complaints."}
{"text":"After a long decision making process, my party decided to attend Fat Ox for Restaurant Week Spring 17. I mean, this is a big deal for us: we all consider ourselves foodies and are 'well-eaten' haha. Anyway, we arrived promptly for our reservation excited to try out the menu we had previously perused. 
Immediately upon entering the door we got the impression from the hostesses that we were putting them out. The hostess at the desk looked me up and down, without a smile on her face, and gave a simple \"Hello\". I did not feel welcome at all though proceeded to give her the details of our reservation. 
We received a similar reception by our waiter, particularly once we told him that we were there for Restaurant Week. After this, we were told they were out of the Hangar Steak, which several members of our 8 person party had already decided upon. They were not offering any substitutions for this item. I began to feel regretful about this choice of restaurant, especially since I had pushed for Fat Ox and made the reservation myself. For the remainder of the evening, service from the waiter was very slow. The waiter assistant, however, was actually very kind and on top of things.      
On to the food. I ordered the Cavatelli as my appetizer. This was good except for the pieces of hen that were a bit chewy/grissly. The corn was a nice, sweet foil to the saltier pasta. The Jidori chicken was the star of the show, very flavorful and tender. The accompanying polenta was very creamy, and I appreciated the addition of the side sauces. I tried a friend's sea bass and was underwhelmed, as there was not much flavor.
I had the affogato for dessert, which was yummy, though more like espresso with a lot of thick whipped cream on top than a traditional affogato. It was served with a side doughnut dipped in a very rich dark chocolate. 

Bottom Line: Even though the food was tasty, it did not make up for the way we were treated. Many restaurants, on RW and otherwise, have much better offerings for similar prices with much better service. We will not be back. Two stars."}
{"text":"Table side caesar salad, garganelli pasta dish (pasta dish way to small of a serving), brussel dish, 40oz. Porterhouse was our dinner combination..... And let me tell you, this combo DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!..  Outta this world.  
Our server was very very knowledgable with the offerings as well as very open to our dietary requirements.  
Stop what your doing and pick up the phone to make reservations!!..
Look forward to a return trip."}
{"text":"High expectations. 

Handsome physical plant.

Truffled pasta was flavorful, but truffle wasn't discernible. 

Staff was warm, if not occasionally disingenuous. For example, without advance guidance, we learned that kohlrabi was essentially cannelloni beans with minimal greens and $110 steak meant to serve three was gristly and modest in size. Server assured us she'd alert kitchen, yet we received no feedback. 

Upon completion of ordering meal courses, staff presence was sparse. 

Tiramisu was to have been accompanied by coffee gelato that seemed more like a crystalline iced coffee.

A part of me craves one more try, but I'm not sure what might merit the effort."}
{"text":"I had drinks then dinner last night.  Bar area is very cool with signature drinks and a happy hour menu.   Food was great and the service was perfect.  I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We were excited to try a new restaurant with our friend from N.Y.  For starters, the bread was awful. It was dry and flavorless. It was actually difficult to chew. The butter also had no flavor. The three menu items were also lackluster, actually bad and Very small portions. They want you to order ten items to comprise one meal . My dish had about 12 noodles on it. Save your money go somewhere else.  We went to In and Out fast food afterwards since we were hungry after our $150 meal. Save yourself.."}
{"text":"Fat Ox is perfect! The restaurant is beautifully laid out with the floor-to-ceiling windows and the large, well-displayed bar. The servers are extremely knowledgeable and professional. The prices are high, but worth it. They served the best scallops I have EVER eaten. And their sign by the bathroom of \"men to the left, because women are always right\" put a huge smile on my face.  :)  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came to check out Fat Ox during the most recent Arizona Restaurant Week, and had a fantastic experience. I arrived a few minutes before our 7:30 reservation and were seated immediately. Their wine list is extensive, and their tables are set with the biggest wine goblets I've ever seen. They have a small but interesting cocktail (or \"oxtail\") menu, and my Bulleits over Bordeaux was strong and delicious. The dishes here are small, but well plated and definitely well done. I had the burrata di bufala, short rib vaccinara, and gianduja frangelico tiramisu. Short ribs are my go to order at most restaurants, and the ones here did not disappoint. The dish here came with three medallion sized pieces, which were perfectly fork tender and came with the most delicious glaze. I also stole a couple bites of my friend's Gigli dish, and the pasta was absolutely amazing. I'm not sure if the portions were smaller due to restaurant week, and I personally left pretty full, but a bigger eater might be left wanting. The desserts here were standard, good but not mind blowing. My tiramisu was creamy and fluffy without being too sweet, though it came on a solid chocolate base that made it a little challenging to eat. I did appreciate that they had espresso options as well as French pressed coffee. Service overall was very attentive, and the employees all looked genuinely happy to be at work, which is a huge plus. 

Note: the parking lot by Fat Ox is pretty small and fills up quickly, but there's usually ample space over by Fogo de Chao."}
{"text":"I was surprised they only have Italian wines as I usually drink wines from Chile or Australia but the atmosphere is nice and there is great parking as well as valet. Looks like a great new place for drinks in our part of town."}
{"text":"Had the Butternut Squash soup with Scallop. Soup was more broth based and not creamy. Lacked flavor. I had filet. Friend had salmon. Portions way too small and the sides were more like garnishes. Steak cooked perfect. Salmon was cooked well but lacked seasoning. Potatoes were good"}
{"text":"Superb! My friend and I had several excellent small plates. I was so impressed with their gluten free pasta dish. Filet and scallops outstanding!
Bartender, Jonathan, rocked! Service and ambiance totally high caliber."}
{"text":"It was my first time in this Italian restaurant, the food was amazing they have really nice service, I will say excellent, everybody ask if everything is okay if we need anything your glass is always full, they're always cleaning your table, very attentive. I had the salmon and it was delicious, we also have a lamb verde rigatoni it was my favorite."}
{"text":"super cute place ! service is over the top great ! they put a napkin on the floor so i can put my purse on was so nice ! tableside caesar salad was amazing presentation and delicious is a must ! portions were small but delicious leaves you with room for their amazing dessert !"}
{"text":"First and foremost, the service blew me away. Our waiter literally gave us a tour of the kitchens/dining areas and had the menu memorized to a tee. He later prepared the most delicious Caesar salad right in front of us. 

The modern Italian style of the restaurant promotes a small dish, mix & match concept, meaning that the four of us ordered several dishes (2 pastas and 2 meats), from which we took food to our individual plates. As a little shrimp in a big world, that freedom to experiment and try everything really appealed to me. Not only that, but the food tasted incredible!! 

When dessert time rolled around, my friend Bartholomew began saying that this may be the greatest meal he's ever had. Our waiter then brought us a trio of his favorite desserts, of which the tiramisu was breathtaking. I'm a tiramisu fanatic, and I kid you not that it was the best I've ever had. (The waiter didn't even charge us for one of the desserts, and his startling kindness makes me think that he's a beautiful merman of sorts.) 

Bottom line: If you want to splurge and try something different, swim over to the Fat Ox and have a mouthwatering time.

Tl; dr: The tiramisu saved me from this cold, harsh world and taught me to live to my fullest potential."}
{"text":"James made my boyfriend and I's anniversary very special. The food was amazing, but the service was even better. Couldn't have asked for a better night and server."}
{"text":"Fat Ox is a new very cool place. Great service and food. Like the bar area. Caesar salad table side. You need to try it. Was there during their soft opening."}
{"text":"The food is pretty overrated. The server never asked us what type of water we wanted, and they kept refilling our glasses, so we were all pretty shocked when we had to pay $50 for water?!?' WTH, if you are charging for the water, or making someone only drink the bottled not tap at least tell them so they know. Nothing memorable about the food. They tried too hard to make it unique, so it just ended up tasting shitty and weird."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. We tried 2 appetizers, 2 pastas, 2 main courses and 2 desserts and we probably really only liked 3 of the 8 dishes we paid for. That's not a great ratio for a $200+ bill. (For the record the dishes we liked were the Caesar salad, tiramisu, and olive oil cake. Not really worth that high of a price to only like an appetizer and 2 desserts. Oh and the olive oil cake is TINY FYI) We also ordered a few things that were either the most popular, or the waitresses favorites...

We were seated immediately and we only called ahead by 45 minutes. We liked our waitress and the staff seemed helpful. It was busy and our waitress disappeared for awhile, but overall was very helpful and attentive. Be mindful that they charge for water. 

Personally I'd probably give them another shot bc I am pregnant and didn't get to try different varieties of raw food, but I'm pretty sure my husband wouldn't go back. He is a great cook himself and really the problems weren't that the dishes were awful, it's just that each one lacked something to make it truly flavorful. They looked beautiful and tasted \"ok.\" I could easily list out each meal we had and why it wasn't that great, (even small things like salt...) but I'll spare you. But I think trying 8 dishes is definitely giving a restaurant a fair shot before leaving a review.  For us personally, we should have spent $200+ on groceries and had a nice meal at home. (For the record... we aren't cheap.., But if a meal cost $45 then it should taste that way. What I tasted, honestly, shouldn't have been more than $20 a plate) But if you've got money to burn, aren't really a \"foodie\" and just want to try different restaurants in the area, then go for it!

After reading other reviews I see that this is the same chef as The Mission, which I enjoy. We should have just gone there;)"}
{"text":"Too loud.   Small portions.    Great service.   Great food."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week and would definitely be open to going back. Cute contemporary decor similar to most newer restaurants. Service was good, prompt and friendly. The specialty cocktails are definitely tasty. They have a barrel aged Manhattan that was delicious. All of the restaurant menu was really good. I particularly loved the short ribs. They give you a steak knife but you don't need it at all, which is awesome! Dessert was good as well. My SO had the budino which is not normally my fave but was actually quite yummy. Overall a solid spot."}
{"text":"Let me start off saying the decor of this place is very beautiful and modern. I was really excited to try this restaurant. The menu is very long and the waiter explained that most of the dishes were small plates. We wanted to try a good variety. I felt like everything needed to be explained and it was exhausting. Everyone around us were saying they were friends of the chef so they got a \"special\" menu.

We started with.. 
-Calabrian Cauilfower- This was okay, had tons of olive oil on it.
-Bellwether Farms Ricotta-The ricotta tasted extra sweet on the bread.

Next we wanted to try a few different pastas. I am a big fan of fresh made pastas. 
-Agnolotti- This one was various ground up types of salami type meats, with a chicken broth poured on top. It was okay, very small.
-Strozzapreti- This is one of the only pastas they don't make in house. It was okay. It was a very simple dish. 
-Casoncelli-This dish looks beautiful but is extremely sweet. Its like eating a pie. I'm glad it was small because anymore would be too much. 

I hate to say it but the pasta didn't change my life. I am willing to pay for fresh pastas but this just didn't do it for me. 

The bread and butter on the plate was pretty and simple. It had good flavor.

I had the 7oz Creekstone Filetto. This was the best part of the whole meal, the filet was cooked nicely. The cheese potatoes were like a little too rich, but good. 

This would be a good place to get a glass of wine and dress up, but not much more. I feel like a lot of the dishes were overrated and underwhelming. The menu will be expensive to pay for the rent at Scottsdale and Lincoln. Nothing I ate makes me want to come back. Loved the decor. That is all."}
{"text":"Fair meal at pretty high price. Pork and scallop entrees really were just not great. Pork dish quite cold, undercooked and lacked flavor. Four scallops for about $8.50/scallop was just over priced. Appetizers were good and pretty reasonably priced.  Pasta was ok but not nearly as good as many other restaurants in the Valley and very small portion- although warned about that by our waiter. On the plus side was the excellent service."}
{"text":"The biggest thing with FO is that it is far too expensive for the service, food and experience.  Then there is the fact that we got sick to our stomachs a couple hours later.

The atmosphere is nice at least.

First the service:  the main hostess was really rude and condascending because we wanted to sit at a table. Bad way to start.

The service from the servers was odd and mistimed.  We would ask for something and it would take a long time to finally get to us.

The food was just ok.  Nothing specia and lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"Delicious is the only way I can describe everything we had here. We happened to dine while it was restaurant week. We had the scallop crudo, ora king salmon, and tiramisu off that menu. All was great but hands down best tiramisu ever! As for the regular menu, I still think about the linguine to this day! The table side Caesar salad is also a must. The garganelli, short ribs, scallops, burrata, and mussels were all tasty. I definitely recommend stopping by for dinner if you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A place to come and be seen-modern Italian is what they claim to be...tasty food but pricey for what you get. Squid pasta tasted great but greasy ($18 small bowl). Same with the other two pastas we tried. If you don't mind that-then try them out.  Great ambiance and this place has a modern/trendy feel to it."}
{"text":"The waiter and busser LITERALLY tried to convince us there was flavor to our meal. They came in succession with words like \"don't you think the \"mild-ness\" of the flavors is exceptional?\" And, \"it doesn't even taste like lamb!\"
WHAT?? 
no, you're right, it tastes like if I bought spinach rigatoni at Whole Foods, dropped a half a stick of butter in it and tossed in some vegan ground beef. 
Thank God our waiter, who clearly was even out of his element with this mediocre at best food, asked his comrade about a wine selection. The one saving grace-. . The ricotta tasted like straight Mayonnaise and don't even get me started on the frozen pimento loaf served with the bread as an opening née amuse bouche. Olive Garden has better flavor. This Fat Ox has none. And no I don't like to get hit over the head with flavor at all times. But something for the money would be great. Will never set foot in there again. I like having a beautiful, flavorful meal. Not something middle America wouldn't even tolerate! Bleck."}
{"text":"I tried pretty much everything, It was all Amazing! Sexy atmosphere to boot!  chef board, Caesar, Gigli pasta, filet, French press coffee, olive oil cake, lemon tart , and pistachio gelato. Yup! Almost every was tried. And all deserving of 5 star."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!    Had the caesar salad (which was great for 4).  Had pork chops, scallops, salmon!  Absolutely awesome!  This is amazing place!  Appetizers were great!  You will not be disappointed! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have visited numerous times and I can now say that I have tried EVERY homemade pasta dish. I can say that they are ALL amazing and will have them on rotation. I love the plating... Fat Ox is like dining in Italy. The courses are just enough so you can make your way through the menu without being too full by time the main course is served. Even though I'm full, I make room for desert!!  With all of that said, the decor is very special, gorgeous inside!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal and dining experience. The food exceeded our expectations. To start we got the veal meatballs and Garganelli, I highly recommend the Garganelli it is absolutely delicious. For the main course we ordered the 25oz. Dry Aged Prime Porterhouse which was without question the best we had every tasted. We opted for the chocolate, raspberry, pistachio creation for desert (not on the menu) which came out looking like a piece of art and tasted even better!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while, so when I saw they were participating in Restaurant Week I decided this was the perfect time to try them out. My husband and I started with extra dirty martinis with blue cheese olives which were perfect! We were served complimentary focaccia with a calabrian chili butter and a marscapone spread which were quite good. For our first course we chose the gigli and linguine pasta. Both were perfectly cooked al dente and the sauce was amazing. The gigli had a fresh san marzano tomato sauce with a flavorful pesto and the linguine had a pork sugo which was to die for! Our mains were very nice too, we had a medium rare skirt steak and grilled swordfish. We went with our servers recommendations for dessert and had the tiramisu and pistachio gelato with toasted crumble, both delicious. Service was wonderful, the staff was on-point at every moment. We weren't blown away by the main courses here but the pasta and cocktails are worth coming back for. We will definitely return to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"While this is a review about Fat Ox, I must say that as someone who relies on Yelp reviews for many things, I find people who irresponsibly apply 1 or even 2 stars for things like...

 \"The prices are crazy and portions are for a toddler. The chef wants the customers to \"share\" their tiny portioned food?!\"
-Quote per Phoenix A. Paradise Valley, AZ

...are doing a disservice to the establishment and really are ones I dismiss as folks who probably should be dining for fast food or staying home with a frozen dinner.  If noise level is high, well, that's a personal preference, but not something that should deter one from visiting.  If you said noise was high because piped in music was blaring or they had a rock band playing behind my table, that'd make sense.  Don't ding them for something others might find a positive.  In fact, Fat Ox has a remarkable vibe and that seems obvious by most people enjoying themselves, which is brought on in part by the overall exuberance of the staff and patrons to the happening experience.

\"The lighting is very dim...for me...too dark.  I didn't actually see my food until I looked at my photos I took.\"
-Quote per
Pepper T. Phoenix, AZ

Seriously?  Maybe put your damn cell phone away, put your spectacles on, take a deep breath and look at your food!  Then engage your brain and don't do what someone on Faceplant told you to do!!!  I bet you text while driving too.  I guarantee you surely don't use the turn signal you paid for!  Dismiss this \"dim\" nonsense!

There are a lot of complaints about portion sizes.  America is so conditioned to super-size marketing that when served an appropriate portion, somehow value comes into question!  The value of Fat Ox is in the chef's preparation, presentation and servers service!

Side bet: I bet all the \"portion\" complainers leave cheap tips too!

My wife's and my order was as follows:
-Navigation (bar) - $15
-Tableside Caesar Salad - $17
-Agnolotti - $16
-Braised Lamb - $32
-Duroc Pork Tomahawk - $32
-Wine (2 glasses)
F-rench Press
Total with tip, $215.

No problem with portion sizes.  The \"tableside\" in the Tableside Caesar Salad is a borrowed concept from The Mission with their tableside guacamole, another great Matthew Carter/Brian Raab restaurant in Old Town (soon to be a second location in North Scottsdale).  We found our salad quite tasty and well portioned.  The total meal was ample and we finished all our food.  We found the Agnolotti very tasty and representative of what we expected portion wise.  We sampled each other's entrees and found each to be 5-star taste.  My wife and I are not overweight, heavy eaters, nor desire the \"OMG, I can't believe I ate the whole thing\" post dining feeling to call is a great restaurant experience.  Value was perfectly acceptable per fine dining.  Our server Jamar was fantastic in his menu knowledge, attentiveness, and answered all our questions.  Sommelier Steve Johnson gave me, someone who is not a wine connoisseur, a perfectly great and reasonably priced wince choice based on my taste preference.

Apologies for turning my restaurant review in part to a social media rant.  With the likes of Twitterdumb, Gulp, Faceplant and such, everyone now has a microphone, which requires more responsibility with such a platform, which our society of course can no longer resist to display its never-ending stupidity.  As I heard recently, it used to be the dumb kids sat in the back on the class.  Now they all sit in the front row!

Ultimately (no, not \"at the end of the day\"), I highly recommend Fat Ox.  5+ STARS!"}
{"text":"I am giving them two stars for a good atmosphere only. The service was not good, we always had to look for our server to get anything. Food was so so and portions are very small. They claim it's tapas style restaurant but their prices are way too expensive for tapas. Their Caesar salad cart doesn't make since to me. What's so special for making Caesar salad I front of our table. I would rather go to ocean club instead. Disappointed. 

Went there a week a go. Amazing drinks as well as food. Great service . I guess they got it right after all."}
{"text":"Fantastic time celebrating an anniversary.  The swordfish was awesome and prepared as a unique bowl meal."}
{"text":"Tried Fat Ox during Spring Restaurant Week. We made reservations for a Sunday evening via Open Table. Got 2 text reminders. 
Hostess was warm and welcoming; we were a few minutes early, so we sat at the bar -- interesting  and unique drink list. Friendly bartender. 
Dinner service was well paced, helpful and pleasant. I think we had a team of 3 working our table. I had the house salad to start, and it was one of the best, most interesting side salads I've ever eaten -- spring greens, frizzled prosciutto, walnuts, blue cheese, pomegranate. Delicious! DH had the veal meatballs and really liked them. For dinner, I had the jidori chicken. It was perfectly cooked and large enough for 2 meals. It comes with a flatbread, caramelized onions and greens. They serve a couple of sauces on the side. DH had the skirt steak w/pan seared mushrooms and onions. He loved it! Serving size was \"appropriate\" --. Not too much food. 
He ended with  tiramisu, which featured roasted banana and Nutella. I snagged a bite. Very sweet but a nice riff on the classic. I had lemon Panna cotta w/raspberry sauce. It was thinner than I expected but I enjoyed it. Both desserts were petite sizes, perfect ending to our meal. 
They have an Italian-heavy wine list w/very few choices under $100/bottle. We had a Barolo that was $75 and quite nice. 
I want to come back to try their pasta dishes. All in All, a very enjoyable evening, both because of the food and the service. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Swordfish for dinner. A great restaurant week selection of meal choices. My swordfish was very close to perfect - moist with an interesting bleak of flavors on the plate. My appetizer was a pasta dish I had never had before - and it was most enjoyable 
The steak that my wife had was perfectly cooked to medium rare. Fortunately her portions were so large that we shared half of her steak the next morning as steak & eggs. Deserts were lovely and also excellent. I appreciated their by-the-glass wine selections. They offer an extensive selection of excellent Italian wines. I enjoyed s lovely Primitivo 
A tad noisy when it filled to capacity / but what the heck - it was Friday night 
If you want to give modern Italian a try the Fat Ice is the place to do so. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"High end Italian food at its best! Impeccable service! 
We had the porterhouse Fiorentina and was cooked perfectly and presented perfectly. The primo pasta was speck, truffle oil, with a touch of cream and lemon- perfect. We also ordered the Caesar and had our server, Canton, prepare it the way he likes it - it was one of the best Caesars, and the right amount of salad. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here last night with my family and was really excited to try something new. I had heard such great things with Fat Ox so I went as soon as I could. The interior is really beautiful. The bar was nice and the place was dark. Now for the review. The service was really good. However, I was not impressed. The set up for the portions is to share basically the entire menu and for the price is was not worth it. I'm a small girl but I have a big appetite! haha. So when I go to dinner and the menu is meant to be shared, I think the portions should be a decent size because it was really small. We skipped the antipasti portion of the menu. We had garganelli which was pretty good, the rigatoni lamb verde; decent, and the linguine clams. We did not like the linguine clams at all. The color for the linguine was red which from the salami and only added four clams that were already out of the shell. You couldn't taste the clams unless you got an actual piece of it. The manager came over immediately after finding out we didn't care for it at all and took it off the bill. For our main course I had the scottish salmon which was very bland, my dad had the lamb which he said tasted like a gyro, and we had the filetto which was good, not great. I have to say the best part of the meal was the dessert."}
{"text":"We went for the first time to this restaurant during  Arizona Restaurant week-Spring 2018.(special menu-3 courses for $44/person) They also serve regular menu as well during this special event.
We both started off  with the pasta. One of us had the Gigli and the other the Tagliatelle. The Gigli is on the regular menu, but the Tagliatelle is not.They were both excellent in portion,taste, & presentation.
The next course we had Ora King Salmon-not on the regular menu, but there is a Salmon with crispy skin. The other Secondi Piatti was the Short Rib Vaccinara which is on the regular menu. Says it has raisins in this dish, but I did not see or taste them and I am not a fan of raisins.  Both second courses were excellent.

Dolce course we had Gianduja Franjelico Tiramisu which looked like 1/2 the portion from the photos I've seen from the regular menu and it also did not include the espresso gelato-which all was ok. The portion served was perfect and it was very good,especially the chocolate on the plate. The other dessert we had was the Bronte Pistachio gelato-2 scoops which is also on the regular menu.

Just a mention the first course on the \"special menu\" had a Burrata di Bufala which was different ingredients from the regular menu and the veal meatballs were also on the regular menu.

Our server Shaun was excellent and we also had another waiter come around and help out, very attentive service from the moment we sat down to the end. We were offered different types of water, we opted for the local Scottsdale water.

Another note we had a Bloody Mary and a Barrel aged(Buffalo Trace) Manhattan from the cocktail list. My DH finished the Bloody Mary the quickest I have seen him, so it must have been good. He usually never finishes a cocktail before I do or rarely finishes his alcohol.

The meats are slow roasted and the pastas made in house.
We thought all the portions were a good size and did not leave hungry. Just a note we did not eat our \"normal\" full lunch portion either.
We enjoyed our visit to Fat Ox."}
{"text":"This place was very fun.. nice young crowd! It's refreshing to have a change in Scottsdale! I chose the salmon like always, it was good, however the main reason for the 5 stars in the tiramisu!!  omg!! Golden!!"}
{"text":"We met a friend at Fat Ox for dinner this week to celebrate the holidays and try somewhere new...Fat Ox certainly did not disappoint!  The restaurant has a lively, fun atmosphere although noisy, the decor is simple, but comfortable, the service was professional and efficient and the food was incredible.  We started with the tableside caesar salad (fantastic!), we followed it up with 2 pastas - the garganelli (simply divine) and the strozzapreti (simple, but tasty) - my absolute favorite part of the meal, continued our entrees with the skirt steak, scallops and salmon and ended the meal sharing a beautiful lemon tart.  The dessert took a while to come out, but the server proactively came over and said it was on the house for the delay - what a nice touch!  Fat Ox is a must visit for a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the Fax Ox. First off our server Canton, was incredible! From the moment we sat down, he took the effort to place a black napkin under my wife's Bag on the table. Then he left us alone while we had our business conversation, only interpreting to get our drink order. After the perfect amount of time, he returned and seeing that we hadn't yet opened our menus, provided some excellent recommendations, so good in fact that we let him order our entire meal for us! His selections were masterful. My wife was given the best cut filet, with seasoned broccoli, our guest was prepared the most delicious short rib I've ever tasted, and I was served the largest and must succulent sea scallops I've ever had. We enjoyed a wonderful bottle of Sauvignon blanc from Marlborough, New Zealand. For dessert Canton surprised us with a delectable chocolate mousse with a hard raspberry shell, the likes of which I will be unable to describe. 
When the bill arrived, I was amazed at how affordable the price for all that we had was. I couldn't give this restaurant a higher recommendation!"}
{"text":"Highly Recommend!
This atmosphere is so vibey, trendy. Very classy and posh.
Huge place, the pictures dont do it justice. Service was FAST and everyone was helpful and kind.
The place was packed, very popular. All the dishes including veal meatballs, pasta, steak, and the butterscotch dessert were excellent."}
{"text":"3.5 stars......very large nice space with multiple rooms.....we moved to the bar after being forgotten in the back room.  :(

GREAT bartenders.....they deserve 5 stars!  Ayla!  Nice cocktails and wines by the glass.

Burrata was not great with tasteless and poorly presented butternut squash (a winter vegetable)....same w/ the cauliflower....I can make it at home.

Swordfish in brodo was excellent.....and the manager was quite nice.

All in all a nice evening.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"EAT HERE! 

I wish there were more stars to give. Absolutely everything was exceptional - from the food to the service. This was some of the best food I've had in my entire life. 

I make my own pasta, so I won't order pasta from restaurants that don't make their own. Well, that's certainly no problem here. We tried FIVE pasta dishes. Each one was delicate, flavorful, fresh and just overall outstanding. Each dish was beautifully presented and delicious even if I didn't know what half of the ingredients were. You literally cannot go wrong.

We started with house bread served with fresh ricotta, tried 5 pasta dishes, enjoyed the porterhouse steak, and topped it off with the chocolate tart. All the recommendations from our excellent waiters were so helpful and every bite was delicious. We flew home to Boston with full bellies and were literally in awe with our dining experience.  

I 200% recommend eating here if you are visiting or live in the area. Make a point to come here, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place lends itself for a formal or casual dinner with mood lightning, and colorful bar. We started our night with the Tagliatelle pasta, which was excellent. From there we moved on to try the Steak and Short rib. We then ended our night with the panna cotta and tiramisu. Fat Ox offers delicious food, great atmosphere, pleasing selection of wine, and friendly but attentive customer service.

Must Try -"}
{"text":"Had a delightful evening with friends at this highly enjoyable new location. We found the service to be sensational. The servers were highly attentive, helpful and friendly. The sommelier could have provided more options than just the single suggestion but, I must say, the suggestion was quite good.

The food was delicious. The pastas were exquisitely prepared, especially the casoncelli that was flavorful and almost desert-like. The skirt steak was excellent and the salmon was perfectly cooked. We weren't a fan of the cheesecake gelato but the pistachio gelato was scrumptious.

Many will be disappointed in the portion size or claim pricing is high. We didn't find it hugely out-of-line though. We do suggest they stock Bailey's Irish Crème at the bar...especially for a chilly winter evening. Indoors is very loud.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Well I'm Sicilian and pasta is my life lol 
This place outside of my own home and my mamas nails it! Fantastic service and the food is so good! 
Highly recommended this restaurant! 5 stars"}
{"text":"Was there with friends last night. All of us for the first time. We have worked through all the best the valley seems to have to offer and this place left me speechless.

Each course perfect. Service exceptional. I don't know if you can find better pasta without getting on an airplane and the secondi was perfecto.

If you go and don't get pasta, you've missed out. And the pork chop was the best of my life.

In a word, craveable."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings here. Food was very good but service started off very strangely. I took my clients here for a celebratory dinner. Since we had a large party we made sure to make reservations in advance. We finished our meeting, got to the restaurant and were seated. A few minutes later staff came by to tell us they were moving our entire party to another table because someone else wanted our table. The whole restaurant is beautiful and on that particular week night was not terribly busy so I'm not sure why our entire party was fully settled and then asked to move to another completely available table a few feet away. We didn't make a fuss about it and the restaurant tried to make it up with some free appetizers but It was disappointing for me, my professional colleagues and clients to be treated this way."}
{"text":"Very busy, trendy atmosphere, but on the loud side. The drinks and appetizers were fantastic, entrees were not as good as I would expect for the price.  Spent over 400 for four people and didn't quite seem worth it. Steak was over cooked and they didn't even offer to remake it or comp it.  Service was average.  I had high hopes to try this new place and it was ok, but not sure I will be spending that much here again."}
{"text":"Terrible experience from beginning to end. The waiter was very condescending and patronizing and spoke to us as children...yet wasn't actually very knowledgeable. His attempts at upselling were gratuitous. Food was poor all around for our entire table...from quality to taste to portions. When we discussed our concerns with the waiter we were simply met with contempt. Fat Ox is grossly overpriced for the food and experience  and I will not return."}
{"text":"Outstanding destination for modern dining. We went on opening night, and you would think they had been open for years. Busy to capacity, staff was on point in every regard, knowledgeable, their in house sommelier came over to greet us, as well as management. We left the order entirely up to the waiter, and boy did he wow us. I couldn't name the foods we tried because there were so many, but it's safe to say the most memorable were definitely the Steamed Mussels, the Agnolotti and Garganelli. We finished off with a couple of their 28oz Dry Aged Prime Porterhouse, which was undoubtedly the best I've ever had. Wow. And then, just when we thought we were full up, they bring out this extraordinary Bronte Pistachio Gelato that was to die for. I could have indeed died that night and been utterly satisfied. We will be back, matter of fact, maybe even tonight! Cheers."}
{"text":"This is my fourth visit to Fat Ox. I love the look that they have pulled off.
The bar is great, awesome cocktails, great wine list, and really good food.
The attention we received from the moment we entered, were served a complimentary low alcohol Italian red Brachetto, and through the courses was fantastic. The one mis-step was on the most recent visit, where 4 requests from our server did not bring extra bread to accompany the two tiny pieces that came with the beautiful mussels and were inadequate to blot up the great sauce, until 30 seconds after the bowl and remaining sauce were taken away.
Matt Carter's kitchen has a way with the wonderful pastas and meat courses. Like the other good Phoenix Kitchens at Virtu, Tratto, Crudo or Binckley's, expect plates of fantastic food, not giant portions of mediocre food.
I have heard complaints about both quantity and wine price. 
I found the prices to be appropriate for what I was served. The meat quality was far superior to what I had at Mastro's City Hall when we couldn't get a table for a birthday last week at Ox. The lamb, scallops and skirt steak we have tried were delicious. We didn't enjoy the Calabrian cauliflower appetizer as much as the side dish version, but loved the Brussels sprouts, clams and mussels...except for our bread issue. The pastas, like the Casoncelli and lamb verde, were amazing.
A real gem is the wine list. Steve Johnson is a VERY experienced Somm. He has all the big name and Italian cult wines that big spenders will order. Restaurants are in business to make a profit or they disappear. He also has a bunch of smaller production, solid wines known by Italian wine buyers in major markets for their value. But, he has gems that he has selected, and I have done this myself, with other wines. He may be the only person in Arizona bringing these wines in, which is why they are available and well priced on their list. I don't know those wines, because I haven't ever tasted them, but when I asked Steve for recommendations at lower price points he steered me that way, and they were better than some of my old standbys when I can't find any solid recommendations, for half the price. 
Use the sommelier! He picked the wines. I have been in retail and importing for 2 decades so I know enough to know that he knows more than me about his own list.
I love this place and hope that it can find the same success as Mission and Zinc! By the way readers, don't forget Virtu. It is one of our best food experiences, and I have had no trouble getting a table lately, when new, more expensive and mediocre Scottsdale places are packed."}
{"text":"Beautiful and delicious grapefruit basil martini.  Did  not have food but will come back to try some because they do have gluten free pasta.  Yeeey!! It's a little pricey, but not terrible.  The bar should be facing the beautiful windows"}
{"text":"WOW, $$$$ for what you get. Not that good. Everyone was so disappointed in their meal. Apps good and a great sommelier, but that's it. Uneven service and grossly overpriced for what you get. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Who on earth do you think you are? Decent cocktails. ALL the rest is so average & disgraceful. Nothing of the elegance of Italy, over cooked pasta and the prices. Scottsdale at its finest. Appalling.
And the sound.. your hipster architect has no idea how to buffer sound? C'mon I can't hear myself think about how I'm wishing I was anywhere but here!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at this new restaurant. Our server Aaron was excellent in describing the unique menu and even offered a pasta \"on him\" for us to try. And it was perfecto. We enjoyed the fried olives, Caesar salad, burrata appetizer, scallops and tomahawk pork. I highly recommend the Fat Ox."}
{"text":"Fat Ox is an upscale restaurant that serves modern Italian Food. The atmosphere is energetic and very loud. The lighting is very dim...for me...too dark. I didn't actually see my food until I looked at my photos I took. Most of the time I had no idea what I was putting in my mouth. Sometimes it turned out to be a good thing and with my dinner it WASN'T a good thing. You will read about THAT latter.

This restaurant offers many small plates of starters and interesting hand made pastas. Our server recommended that we order a starter, THREE pastas (because they are small tastings) and dinners. 

I have to say the Charred Taleggio was very good. I couldn't see the pomegranate  seeds on it but I felt them pop in my mouth. This dish was balanced, interesting and tasted great.

The Casoncelli Butternut Squash Stuffed Pasta was AMAZING and by far my favorite dish of the evening. It was a very small portion. It was like eating just three stuffed rigatonis but the Casoncelli was so full of great flavors and texture. The pasta was so perfect I could have eaten this whole plate myself.

At this point I was very pleased with the food I was served and thought this could still be a five star experience.

My expectations were very high and I only ordered the Chicken because I've been to the Chef's other restaurant Zinc Bistro and was served maybe the very BEST CHICKEN in Metro Phoenix there so I was expecting something that compared.

Our dinners arrive and take my first taste. I note again it's very dark and hard to see what I'm digging into. I got some chicken with Rubbery Soft Chicken Skin Covered in a Tangy but tasty sauce. I have to be honest and I tell it like it is. IT WAS LIKE PLAYING MURDER IN THE DARK WITH THE CHICKEN. For me it was too difficult to navigate threw the rubbery skin and bones in the dark. I accidentally swallowed a pile of fennel I had no idea was there. I didn't even know until I looked at the photos I took that my plate had radishes on it.

My husband had the Skirt Steak. I tried a piece and to be honest I don't remember what it tasted like. It wasn't very memorable. My husband complained to me that the food wasn't hot and was only warm. He said his favorite part of his plate was the green part of the roasted carrot. He said the carrot top was the tastiest part.

My waitress seemed nice and tried to be very helpful but neglected to tell me that my plate came with polenta. I didn't think my meal came with anything but charcoal red peppers that the menu states. (P.S. Chicken was NOT over charcoal red peppers,((opening hiccup or menu typo)) So I ordered an extra side that I wouldn't have ordered. Not a big deal but it is the truth.

Maybe because I couldn't see the polenta it didn't taste like polenta to me. Or maybe it contained too many add ins. I don't know. It was tasty and good but the base of it tasted more like farina and not corn.

The Calabrian Roasted Cauliflower might have been missing the Calabrian Chili unless it was powdered but was ok. 

In short I thought the pre-dinner courses of Charred Taleggio and the pasta dish of Casoncelli was excellent. Dinners weren't bad but didn't compare to the previous dishes. Service was good. Atmosphere would be better if it wasn't so loud or so dark. They have interesting lighting fixtures all over the restaurant and the decor is eye pleasing.

I note that at the time of this review (12-4-16) this is a newly opened restaurant and they may be still be in the growing stage figuring things out."}
{"text":"Mixed bag review here....so wanted it to be good but left VERY disappointed.  First- love the greenhouse front of the house!  Nice and light and a good vibe.  The rest of the decor...clearly alot of money was put into it but it's a mix of 80's and dark decor- not my cup of tea but that's ok.

Service- good but felt like they were consistently apologizing for things.  Sorry we don't have a lunch menu yet, we haven't decided on brunch because the chef can't get it right, sorry no specials. Don't have happy hour but we're thinking about it....REALLY- no happy hour! 

Argued when we commented about the RIDICULOUSLY high prices....it's not New York!  They claimed to be inline with Houston's, Steak 44 etc but at least you don't leave there hungry!  I totally agree so many restaurants waste food and go over board- but this is the opposite extreme.  I left hungry and a couple of hundred dollars out of pocket.  

The food is very good- can't argue that but THE PORTIONS ARE TINY.  Ordered Caesar salad. It was good...little soggy but good flavor but again SMALL!  Tortellini.....fabulous but 5 MINIATURE pieces. FIVE!!!!  Glass of wine minimum $17 

Guys- you run some wonderful restaurants and this has the elements to be one of them but take the prices down a notch and increase the food portions otherwise I'm afraid you won't be around too long."}
{"text":"OMG! The Fat Ox is the bomb! Great location, super friendly staff and great food at a great price!!! Darva' our host was wonderful telling us about the menu items and suggestions. The staff was always checking to see if we needed anything else.
The food was awesome from the Caesar salad, Veal meat balls. Then the Green Tortellini OMG Great! I could have just had more of the tortellini and been satisfied but then came the Salmon and Felet... topped of with some Martinis... dam fine meals great prices full bar and great atmosphere! A very hip place!! Will come back anytime we come to town. 
Can only give 5 stars but deserves 10 stars"}
{"text":"Great ambience, but food is very average. $18-$20 pasta dishes are pretty basic and nothing extraordinary. Caesar salad, Linguine and Scallops were just ok, nothing I'd go back for. Ambience is fun and lively, but much better food can be found elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fat Ox is an impressively large restaurant, and on a Saturday night it was completely packed. The waiters were very nice but a bit slow, and the food came out a little cold- I think (and hope) mostly due to a large party seated near us. However, they recognized the lapse in service and gave us two desserts on the house. All in all, Fat Ox is a great space for dinner (as long as you don't mind the loud noise on a busy night), and the experience was pleasurable!"}
{"text":"This Italian spot wows in every way. We picked this restaurant to kick off our vacation here in Scottsdale and to celebrate my birthday. The decor and airy digs really strike a nice chord-fantastic food and service with just the right amount of casual elegance. 

We had a two man team of servers who were probably the best servers we have ever had anywhere. They were personable and so obliging... attentive, yet not overbearing. We started with a bottle of Barbaresco. Very good. Their mainly Italian sourced wine list is really nice and well priced. But if you need your fix of the big bold overpriced California cabs, they're there too! 

I opted out of the appetizer course to save room for the entree and dessert. But our server must have overheard me remarking how delicious the fresh pastas sounded and he sent over a small portion of the green tortellini. Wow. Perfectly al dente pockets of yumminess. The flavors were so bright and this starter is incredibly delicate. My husband had the linguini which was also cooked to perfection with a creamy tomato sauce that was to die for. 

And right before our entrees arrived, another surprise... the garganelli pasta with duck sausage that I had said I needed to try. I must tell you I never eat pasta in the United States-well almost never... all 3 fresh preparations could go head to head with any of Mario Batali's. Totally worth the splurge and extra hours in the gym. 

The scallop entree was beautiful, and the flavors really sang but the mollusks themselves were a bit small and probably should have been cooked 20 seconds less. The Jidori Chicken was supple and juicy. It tasted good but was a bit uninspired. The salmon entree and cauliflower sides ordered by our friends looked good but didn't get rave reviews. 

To top off our evening, the server sent out a medley of desserts (we could not decide) and he presented a tray with an olive oil cake, pistachio gelato, affogato and a crazy good sugar donut filled with the an airy hazelnut cream. What a finish to a spectacular meal. 

Between the service, the wine list, the pasta and the dessert this modern Italian restaurant surely garners 4 stars. With a few adjustments I could easily award 5 and I will definitely come back to do just that. Thank you Fat Ox for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"In town for a medical conference and ended up eating here 3 nights consecutive! 

I was treated by my colleague the first night and was so impressed with our server Jennifer and the entire experience that I wanted to treat him the following evening and try more of the menu. 

We then returned with a group of doctors for the 3rd night and keeping our favorite server were able to share a wonderful indoor experience (after having great patio dining the first two. Highlights of the menu for me included the house salad, the parsnip pasta (yes, it's worth the carbs!) and the grass fed filet with porcini shrooms and tiramisu with pistachio gelato. 

Jennifer is an excellent server that creates the experience and ensures you no disappointment! 

Thanks Jennifer!! =)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I do at least one or two date nights a month.  We decided to try this new place we've heard of through a few mutual friends.  The manager, Darvay, greeted us at the door and showed us to our table.  We sat down and was immediately greeted by Canton, our server.  By far one of the coolest servers we have ever had.  He was very knowledgeable on everything in the menu.  Like this guy explained the dishes so well that it actually made it even harder on us to decide what to get.  Which was a good thing because we just ended up ordering half of the menu :).  We started with the burrata and prosciutto which was exquisite.  Canton also showed us to a couple fantastic cocktails I can not remember the names but one was like a tequila mule and the other was a smokey mezcal drink that was shaken and in a martini class...FANTASTIC!!  Next we had the ricotta pasta with rabbit tenderloin...AMAZING!!  Then we ordered not one, not two, but THREE entrees.  He explained them so well that we couldn't resist.  We ordered the 18oz Ribeye, Half Jidori Chicken, Short Rib and a side of Cauliflower. They were all so delicious that I can't say I like any one more then the other.  Definitely a place you should be prepared to drop some coin if you want to have the WHOLE experience.  We literally almost ordered the 40oz Porter House as well but didn't want to get too out of control. Next time FOR SURE! Canton brought us out an AMAZING red Toscana blend called ARCANUM.  It was a 2005 and one of the best wines that I've ever had.  Paired so well with all the different flavors we had on the table.  They said it was the last bottle so hopefully they get some more in soon please!  We obviously had plenty to box up for left overs tomorrow and we had to save room for dessert.  We finished with a couple shots of Avion tequila that Canton brought out with 2 orange slices that had sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the top.  Very smooth tequila but my girlfriend I both agree that the orange slices just made to awesome!!  We will be taking that secret back home with us, thank you!  We also had the tiramisu which was simply to die for.  We definitley finished every bite.  We will be back for sure.  Requesting Canton as well.  He really hit it out of the park!"}
{"text":"Brian + Matt have done it again! The Fat Ox is now open & it's fantastic! The build out is beautiful, service was impeccable and the food, beyond delicious! Can't wait to bring the family! Oh and the hand-pressed cocktails + wine list are on point!! And P.S. The ladies' room has spectacular lighting"}
{"text":"Not my favorite place. Pretentious. Wouldn't let us order appetizers at the bar. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fabulous evening on the patio with my Fiancée. Excellent service from starting with a warm greeting in the parking lot to the beautiful smiles at the front desk. Our server was prompt, sweet and attentive. Highly recommend the Barrel aged Manhattan and the Caesar Salad. I had the Scottish Salmon - excellent bites of risotto with the salmon. My love had the trumpet mushrooms (only $9, really?) and the butternut squash pasta (hand rolled)
. Topped it off with tiramisu and tawny port. 
Fat Ox is an excellent addition to the Scottsdale restaurant scene. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"Pretty sad experience here that's for sure. First our waiter was super sick. He voice was so horse he literally had to talk directly in your face to hear him. And I didn't enjoy having his sick breath blown in my face that's for sure. The food tasted amazing but the portions were extremely small. I don't mind paying a lot of good food but at least give me a portion I can get decently full on. I brought my girlfriend at the time, she ordered some pasta dish. She's pretty small and doesn't eat that much, but she was still really hungry after she ate so I told her to order another one. After they brought us our check the waiter hovered around waiting for me to put the card in the thing, felt rushed."}
{"text":"So we didn't know what we were walking into when we went to dinner here. When looking at the menu we thought it to be a bit expensive until we had the food. This food was top notch. Everything we had was delicious.  We aren't big on seafood so I just wished there were a few more dishes to chose from that did not have seafood. But other than that I would highly recommend if you are looking for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro is my hands down favorite restaurant in town so I was really, really looking forward to loving Fat Ox. To me, it was really unmemorable and to be honest, vaguely Italian in comparison to Zinc's on point rendition of a 7th arrondisement brasserie. Incredibly loud and super dark even for me and I love good high energy restaurant as much as the next 30 something Scottsdale chick. Way too much meat on the menu - salmon as the only option for fish eating folk? Salmon is the new chicken these days. Portions didn't make sense - mussels starter could have fed 6 people, but two teaspoons of burrata was barely enough for everyone at our table to have a lick. Perhaps I'll try this again in the future as a girlfriend's lunch spot, as lunch is what Zinc really nails for me, but for now its a pass. Bummer."}
{"text":"We went there last night for my birthday. The food was probably five stars but the ambience, lighting, and noise was unacceptable. They sat us at a table that was so close to tables on either side we could hear their entire conversation. The table was so small we had to rearrange it every time we got a plate. This is definitely not a romantic place to be. Definitely should not charge the prices that they charge for food with what I have mentioned above. Wine is expensive compared with other restaurants in their category."}
{"text":"My wife and I just dined here with good friends and I can say without reservation I would recommend Fat Ox to the many guests I come in contact with as a concierge. Jennifer and Isabel waited on us and we could not ask for more attentive service. The menu can be a little daunting and thankfully, Jennifer recommended courses that hit the mark in every instance. We began with a prosuitto and mushroom appetizer, followed up with rigatoni lamb verde, and finished with scallops accompanied by mushrooms and pancetta. As difficult as it was choosing from the many great looking course selections, choosing dessert was equally difficult. We settled on 3, the Tiramisu, Meyer Lemon Tart, and a special chocolate fudge concoction. Great look and feel to the dining area with an inviting patio. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Our first visit was for New Year's Eve. Great vibe. Feels like a restaurant on the Las Vegas strip in a resort like Bellagio or Aria. Friendly service from great staff. Awesome food. Some naysaying reviewers were complaining about portions. Not me. I left full. The Squid Ink linguine was outstanding and unique. The filet mignon was perfectly prepared, and obviously prime with a great smokey flavor that was outstanding. For dessert the olive oil cake was fabulous. Just the right blend of bitter and sweet. My wife had tiramisu which she said was outstanding. Great wine list. This spot will be put in our \"high end\" rotation of restaurants. Yes, its expensive, but I believe the value is there. Also, plenty of self parking. Valet at restaurants is just annoying to me."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy this restaurant at all.  The waitress was great but the food was not worth the cost of the dinner.  Compared to other restaurants in town this place is not worth it going too.  The atmosphere is okay but nothing special.  I would skip going here for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing.. one of the best meals I have ever had. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Service was top notch, atmosphere was moody but not too dark, decor was beautiful, and oh the food was amazing did I mention that? Can't wait to go back, I will be craving everything until then."}
{"text":"My mom and I tried this place for restaurant week last week. First impression was that it's a got a nice vibe with mid-century modern decor. The hostess was nice and saw our reservation and seated us quickly. It was early so they weren't busy which was nice. They didn't ask if we wanted the restaurant week menu right away but when we finally saw our server we asked him for it and he obliged. The menu looks good but is definitely geared more towards the meats and not as heavy on pasta which I thought was strange since it's a modern Italian place. We picked out what to try on the restaurant week menu and ordered. The wait staff at first seemed very distant and too good to talk. But the manager on duty was very nice and answered questions we had, stopped by to check on us was just pleasant to talk to. But still we didn't feel like we really fit in which was unfortunate. When the food started coming though, the flavors just burst in your mouth. It was all amazing starting with the bread you get when you sit down to the meal. Only one drawback was that the skirt steak wasn't done right. I wanted it medium, figuring it'd be closer to medium rare but it came out barely rare on half of it. The taste was still amazing but some was just too rare to eat. The deserts were ok, nothing o wrote home about. The table next to us got a salad and it was made in front of them which looked amazing. And they have a great wine and drink list. Just wish they were a little more welcoming and the steak was on point. Definitely want to try it again since some restaurants just aren't the same during restaurant week."}
{"text":"While staying in Scottsdale/Phoenix for a weekend, it's sometimes a difficult choice to pick the right restaurant since there are so many good options. Headed into this dinner, I thought we had made the right decision, but we walked away pretty disappointed. 

Our waiter informed us that he and another waiter would be sharing our table. Great idea as it'll help move things along especially on a busy night. Sadly this didn't turn out to be the case. 

We started off our dinner with the table-side Caesar and Garganelli (truffle butter pasta). Really strong start, attentive service and everything was trending in the right direction. 

After this our main course order of Waygu Beef (on special) along with the Diver Scallops took almost an hour to come out and our waiters (x2) were no where to be found. On top of this when the main courses finally arrived, they were just warm, not even hot and extremely underwhelming for how much everything ended up being. 

With high hopes of a spectacular meal at Fat OX, we walked away pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was wonderful. My husband found the Fat Ox, which was near our resort, on yelp and made a reservation on Open Table and mentioned we were celebrating our Anniversary. We went on a Monday evening, so it was not super busy. I love italian food, especially anywhere that serves homemade pasta. The entire restaurant space was beautiful, very classy. We were seated on the lovely patio. The view isn't much, but it's far enough off the street that you can't hear any of the traffic noise. The server mentioned our anniversary and brought us some complimentary Prosecco, which was very thoughtful. I wish I could remember our server's name, because she was absolutely wonderful. She steered us in the right direction for each course selection. We started with the mozzarella burratta, which was simple but fresh and delicious. We then moved on to the pasta course, where we couldn't decide, so again she helped us choose the Garganelli and Lamb rigatoni. They were perfectly portioned and absolutely delicious. We could have probably just kept eating pasta, but we also ordered the scallops to share. This was a good decision because we were quite full by this point. The scallops were perfectly cooked with great flavor. Our server offered a complimentary dessert, but we ordered more drinks instead as we were much too full for dessert. I ordered an espresso martini, which definitely hit the spot. Overall, this was a wonderful meal and we will certainly be back the next time we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place!  The design and atmosphere is well thought out.  I loved the skirt steak all the different pastas.  Meals aren't huge but this is how they are in Italy.  The bar area is unique and fun.  I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This place was actually a lot better than I thought it would be. I went here for a company holiday dinner and when the menu got sent out I was immediately like \"well what the...\" because I truly couldn't understand hand of it. I am not even joking. I was dreading the meal. 
Fortunately because it was a company thing the appetizers were chosen for us. They were good, especially the brussel sprouts salad. When it came to the main meal the server did a great job of explaining each item and making recommendations. However he didn't do a really great job of explaining how tiny the pasta dishes were. Do not think you can go and have pasta for a meal. One dish had like 7 pieces of bow tie pasta. I am not joking. They intend for the meal to be several courses so it's tiny portions. I got the braided lamb and it was delicious.
The dessert was the olive oil cake and it was really good. So overall I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious, and Johnny and Mike were fantastic! Will definitely be coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"After eying Fat Ox for quite a bit, I finally decided to try it out with a girlfriend from out-of-town. I am endlessly glad we did! The staff was beyond amazing, everyone from the host who found us seating in the packed restaurant to the servers who were courteous and professional. The owner even threw in a bottle of champagne for us! If that's not treating you guests right, I don't know what is. Finally, the food. We had a sampling of five different pastas and could not choose a favorite. The flavors were unique and an adventure for the tastebuds. Above par experience! Thank you Fat Ox!"}
{"text":"We had a phenomenal anniversary dinner at Fat Ox while visiting Scottsdale. The staff could not have been more attentive, the food could not have been more delicious. Fantastic atmosphere and all around a great night. Special thanks to our server Billy, who did all he could to make this a special and unique meal for us. Thank you to the Fat Ox team, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service really speaks here. We were in town for a girls birthday weekend and wanted a \"fancy\" night out. The wait staff was amazing, even the manager came out to pour champagne on the house. I really wish I stuck to my guns and ordered a pasta dish but when you say filet I always cave. It was great don't get me wrong, but the pastas going by definitely made me second guess my decision. 

Appetizers - Burrata and another item

Entrees - I ordered the filet rare and it was really tasty. Being family, we obviously took bites of each other's dishes - the Short Rib Alla Vaccinara and Squid Ink Pappardelle were amazing! 

Dessert - Chocolate Torte

Again, too busy talking and eating to take pictures but it was a wonderful place with amazing staffers for a special night."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Also from a value standpoint... you won't regret how much you spent."}
{"text":"Not so great!  The food is mediocre and nothing special by any means. If you really aren't a foodie and just want a nice social atmosphere with loud music and middle aged scottsdale scene than you will probably like this place.  I had the mussels which were fishy tasting and full of tomato soup broth, pasta with lamb and pesto which was not bad but didn't have the fresh pesto taste at all and way too much salt and then the scallops.  Scallops were rubbery and tasteless.  Just not good food.  Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks! Loved every dish especially the jidori chicken.  

Restaurant can get loud and crowded but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Chef Matt Carter and front-man Brian Raab have knocked it out of the park...again. These are the guys who brought us The Mission (including the new location in Kierland), The House Brasserie, and had a hand in Zinc Bistro as well.

These guys are at the absolute top of their culinary and hospitality games, and it shows the second you walk in any one of their doors, where you will be greeted by professional, friendly, and efficient hosts/hostesses, and then served well-crafted cuisine by true professionals who are knowledgeable and passionate about the food and drink they are serving, prepared and plated by a kitchen brigade that puts out consistently delicious and impeccably presented fare.

Fat Ox is a successful attempt by this team to exceed their already exceptional standards, and it is fine dining at its best: upscale without feeling overwrought; mesmerizing without being ostentatious; and satisfying to every sense and every sense of the word.

The cuisine is inspired by Italian classics, with a modern twist, and includes vegetarian, pasta, beef, poultry, and seafood entrees, along with a substantial offering of charcuterie, cheese, salads, and other lighter plates perfect for small meals and/or sharing as part of a more extensive dining experience. A nice dessert selection is also available, along with coffees and after-dinner liquers. There are also a number of interesting and tasty hand-pressed cocktails to choose from, including some interesting combinations that really work well.

The extensive wine list is fabulous, presented by an experienced sommelier who can guide everyone from the occasional wine-sipping novice to the more experienced wine enthusiast, with equal aplomb (in our case, it was \"Stephen\", who set the table up with a wine flight to go with each course, including a palate-awakening rose in the salad and cheese course, a couple of reds of varying fullness and profile with the pasta plate and entree, and a sweet lambrusco to finish it off).

Highly-recommended for anyone who loves creative food well-prepared, in a setting with an energetic vibe, served by professional and efficient staff."}
{"text":"This was the best meal we ate on a 5 day food tour. Do yourself a favor and skip the main entree, try the fresh pastas and dessert menu."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants!!!! Jennifer was our server twice and was so sweet. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is to die for. We recommend to all of our friends"}
{"text":"So where do I begin, disappointment doesn't fully describe our experience. We were a party of four.  The waiter explained that the portions weren't \"overly large\", he was somewhat correct but he should have said they were absurdly small. I don't often leave a restaurant hungry and thinking where can I stop on the way home for a quick bite.   The waiter explained that we should share the meals, but order a number of courses, which is what we did.   

We started with a Ceasar Salad, it was very good but small in size , our second course was an order of Barrata cheese, which also was very tasty.

Our third course was pasta, we ordered a Cavatelli with chicken, there was barely two tablespoons of past.  Absurd,  I believe it was $18 and was supposed to be a main course and was barely an appetizer size.

Our fourth course was Flank Steak., $35,  they first brought out steak knives that you could use to butcher the ox with, and then out came the steak. Eight or so thin strips of steak,  I mean thin, it would have been laughable if I wasn't paying for it. 

The atmosphere was very nice, and all the dishes were very tasty and well done.  The place was packed tonight but my guess is that they'll be out of business in six months. No Ox got fat eating here."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 10 last week for a holiday work dinner.  I was really looking forward to trying this place after checking out their menu online.  Really cool atmosphere, but be warned, it was loud.  I had to lean in to talk to my bf next to me and it was next to impossible to hear what the group was saying at the other end of the table.  Our service experience was interesting.  They have only been open about a month and I could tell they still had a few kinks to work out.  For starters they ran out of menus.  They told us this off the bat so for our group of 10 we only had 5 menus for the table.  At one point in the evening, a server came up to me and asked if he could have my menu so he could give it to another table.  Not a huge deal, but really?  Not having enough menu's especially on a Friday night?
Our server was a little bizarre. He was really over the top and theatrical but in an off putting way.  He was efficient but a little cringey.  We ordered an array of appetizers,pastas and sides to share and yes, the portions are very small.  With the pasta dishes I was able to have exactly 1 noodle per dish. Still very delicious though.  For my main dish I ordered the Creekstone Filetto.  It was good, but didn't blow me away.v  My overall experience here was fine, a nice night out, but I don't think the quality of food matched the pricing."}
{"text":"Fat Ox has a clean, trendy interior with great light exposure from large windows on north side of restaurant. Menu items are intended to be shared among the table but not required. The menu also has multiple courses and if you order according to how it's designed, will take you through multiple courses. Portion sizes vary greatly but a single dinner entree is large enough to get full. Service was pretty good. Our waitress walked us through the experience and did a great job explaining the menu. Food itself was good as well, but it is a little pricey, and I didn't feel that it was distinct enough to pay what we did. They do have a large cocktail and wine menu as well."}
{"text":"We attended a private party with a fairly large group.  The restaurant handled the logistics very well.  Service was attentive.  Passed appetizers were good.   For the seated part of our meal the pasta was the standout - perfect texture with a good chew, and delicious sauces.     The steak could have used more seasoning and the chicken was just 'ok'.   We definitely want to come back - smaller group next time!"}
{"text":"Booked our New Years Eve dinner here because we love this restaurant.  In addition, my husband's company booked a corporate event, which was a success.  However, when we experienced our New Year's Eve dinner, it was very disappointing.  We were enticed to consider an additional menu item on a fixed priced menu and were not told it was an additional up charge.  To our dismay, the up-charge was 125% above the fixed price.  Most certainly, this should have been disclosed and agreed upon.  In addition, the glass of Prosecco, that was included in the fixed menu, was actually nothing more than a taste.  

Very disappointed on their deception to their guest on New Year's Eve!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! I have been back here a few times, and have always had a great experience. This last time, I was having cocktails at the bar and had left my card. The bartender ran my card all the way out to my car. FIVE STAR SERVICE!

The cocktails were great, especially the old fashion, and they have happy hour until 7. Ambiance is mid century modern and gets busy at night. Cool place, good food, five star customer service. 

Thank you Mr. Bartender! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Mel was wondering!  Love my wine in there Giant Glasses!!. There Large mussels were phenomenal! Chicken was tasty but all the side stuff (what for)? WAIST.  Scallops were very yummy..  Atmosphere is alive and upbeat, but NO privacy. Seats are VERY close!  Listened to the conversation of table next to us all night. Next time I would try the pasta. 
I will stick to drinks and appetizers at the bar.  
But all and all I love this place. Good people good fun good vibe 
At bar :)"}
{"text":"We dined last night with our daughters and their husbands. This birthday celebration was fantastic. Staff was excellent. 
We were treated to one of the best dinners in a long time. The caeser salad was done to perfection. Some of us have limitations GF , etc. All our salads were designed for our needs. The rest of the food was just as wonderful. Too many dishes to mention . I will definitely return and recommend to all my friends and family. 

One suggestion.Since we eat fish as our main protein we would like more choices."}
{"text":"This place is all.....YUMMY.. OmG, the interior of the place was classy and it's small but every thing has a spot.  

Let's start with the food..... WoooooooW! I ordered the salmon, can I say tender, light with skin seared cripsy...  it was swimming in a tomato and bean sauce which was so awesome I could've had it by itself.  

The appetizer was a caesar salad with the old school anchovies salad dressing.... yes, finally a ceasar salad worth eating!

And the best thing of all was the dessert, a creamy tirimusi with a layer of chocolate at the bottom......woooooow!

I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for a work event and actually came in with sort of low/mixed expectations based on previous reviews BUT I was blown away. 

The ricotta appetizer was delicious and such a fun, different then normal app to try. The green tortellini was seriously so good, it was a little sweet but also had an interesting spice on it, loved it! For my main course I had the chicken that came with flat bread/ tortilla, onions, lemon caper sauce and surprisingly my favorite was the hot sauce (not even sure if that's the right word for it because it thankfully wasn't super spicy but had a lot of excellent flavor). 

Dessert was the olive cake which was only enough for one which was great because I didn't have to share!  Zach our server took great care of us too! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is really good.  The menu interesting. The service is prompt, efficient, and professional.  The noise level, however, about ruins the dining experience.  We will for sure go back and try it again;  on a Tuesday, in July, at about 5:00pm."}
{"text":"We had an interesting dinner at Fat Ox the other night...  The rave reviews and accolades brought us in.  Our server was terrific, very personable and helpful in ordering as he steered me to what he thought I would like best on the menu based on my preferences. 

I'm not sure what steak I had for my main but it was delicious as was the mussels starter with a scrumptious tomato broth. Most of our table seemed quite satisfied with their meals with the exception of one dish. A pasta selection that was supposed to have truffles on it, possibly as an add on.  When the tray of our mains came out to the table the person delivering the food turned around and went back in the kitchen.  It was a bit of time and then they returned.  After tasting the pasta, my friend, who is a chef and owner of a catering business, asked where the truffles were on her dish.  The server apologized and said that the dish had dropped coming out of the kitchen and that was the last of the truffles that they had.  They offered to bring some truffle oil/butter on the side and did.

For this caliber of restaurant, that was unacceptable to me.  We were having a great time and enjoying the company at our table and just let it go.  However, I feel the restaurant should have 1. Offered her to select an alternate dish before they served the table, or 2. Most certainly should have let her know before she had to ask and also comped her entree.  

On their behalf, they may have given us some dessert gratis, however, if it was, we were never told and I believe some of our party ordered from the restaurant week menu anyway which would have included dessert.  With a party of 6 and 3 bottles of wine, things got a bit hazy by the end of the meal!

Nevertheless, overall the food was very good and the service - aside from our mishap - was exceptional."}
{"text":"$7 for water and the mussels were terrible, not a good first visit. Too many great choices nearby to stop here IMO."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've had in a long time! It is a bit pricey but 100% worth it, the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I do not understand the negative reviews of this place. My husband and I went here last night to celebrate his birthday and it was honestly one of the best meals that we have ever had. Granted, this place has quite a scene starting at around 8 o'clock on a Saturday evening but it ends pretty quickly. If you can get beyond the half-dressed women and their ridiculous male counterparts that only Scottsdale provides I think that you'll find that this place is actually fantastic. We started with cocktails which word delicious-some of the best that we've ever had. For food we started with the Buffalo mozzarella which had a delicious citrus flavor and progressed to the lamb Ragu which is a must try and the butternut squash ravioli which had flavors that were totally unique. While the portion size of the pastas could have been larger our waitress Amanda was attentive and knowledgeable and guided us appropriately through the menu including the wine list which she knew perfectly. She recommended a bottle of nebiolo which was affordable and fantastic! Apparently you can make a reservation and request a waitress-- I would highly recommend requesting Amanda she was honestly wonderful. For our main course we had the half chicken which was totally unique and delicious and the salmon which was cooked perfectly. They generously recognized my husband's birthday by providing us a dessert on the house, a delicious tiramisu that we devoured. Again it was an absolutely fantastic evening. There's nothing that I would change about this place. If you have time to have a relaxed dinner and you're going out for special occasion I would give this place a try. It's very special."}
{"text":"Have been here now twice since they opened and each time had an incredible experience. Our server on the first visit was Ryan and he was so knowledgeable and friendly as always,  we have been following him for years.  Ryan gave us a tour of the kitchens/dining areas which has never happened to us before. He recommended a Brunello which was spectacular. The concept is fabulous gives everyone a taste of all that they have to offer. Caesar salad table side? Are you kidding me, don't miss it.
Quite a difficult task to decide what to order but based on all of Ryan's suggestions, we were quite happy and quite full by the end of the meal. The garganelli is not to miss, skirt steak another not to miss, the scallops delish. Great for a group, great for just two."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, especially with the new chef. My family is from Italy and I can honestly say the pasta, especially the lasagna and linguini, are delicious.  The management is friendly, fun and professional.  The restaurant is run very well. I love that they now use REAL martini glasses! One minor critique - on the charcuterie board, I wish they could find a substitute for ham.  Eating San Danielle prosciutto along side of ham is like having a filet minion and skirt steak on the same plate. Overall, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great but the service was quite the opposite. My waitress did not give us the full dining experience neglecting to serve us the table side Caesar. Failed to refill waters and bring over napkins and utensils. While my entire pasta was very good, I expected more of the service and dining experience. Would not return"}
{"text":"I will start with the good. Great location! Nice architecture and interior design. Great service and tasty food. 

Now for the bad...it's so loud in the restaurant you literally cannot hear yourself think, let alone hear the people you are dining with! Our poor waitress had to yell at us to explain the menu and to tell us her favorites.  

I don't speak Italian so I didn't know what the menu meant.    English please!

The food was very good, but way over priced for the serving size. $17.00 for a table side Caesar salad that fit on half of a salad plate? They said it was for two- I'm a girl and could have eaten the entire thing! Pasta dishes to share starting at $15.00 with no meat...? And we were told all their dishes are for sharing? If you shared the dish person could have one bite.  

Loved the family sharing concept, but for those prices the dishes should be almost doubled in size. 

I wanted to love this place- and it came so close in so many areas...but the noise was a deal breaker for me!! If you want good Italian with a fun vibe- Try Mora!!!"}
{"text":"My main reason behind giving this place 2 stars is because the prices were sky rocket high for a tiny tapa size portions of food. My husband and I went to this restaurant recently to celebrate our 2 year anniversary, and mind you, we love wine and italian food. We have traveled all of Italy multiple times, and we were so excited to try Fat OX. 

The service was absolutely bar none. We were seated in a bright area of the restaurant, and when we went, it was not busy at all. There was maybe 3 other dinner parties in the place, so we cannot speak to the place being loud. It was actually a nice atmosphere. The waitress placed my purse on a napkin on the floor, and was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.

We decided to order an appetizer a pasta and a fish. While the food was excellently prepared and tasted well, we left so hungry. The wine was over priced for what it was (greater than $15 a glass). We left with a bill over $200 for the two of us. 

They need to give you better portion sizes. Even in all of Europe, where portion sizes are smaller than USA, you get more stuff for your money... We likely will not return. For $200 price, we suggest you drive up to Sassi for a sunset view, gorgeous place, amazing food, and great sizes. If we were to compare a restaurant on a busy street in a strip mall to Sassi in North Scottsdale, we would tell you to go to Sassi. 

This place has great potential. But they are a little overboard w pricing and not enough food to equal out the pricing. Wonderful staff, delicious food, mediocre wine."}
{"text":"Their menu is not very vegan friendly but the chef made me a special vegan pasta. It was AMAZING. Still craving more of it. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"I thought this place would be a little better but it was only \"OK\". First, it's very loud in there. Could barely hear my husband sitting across from me. Second, the pastas were also \"OK\". We did also have the steak which was cooked very well so that was good. I really wanted to be wowed with amazing pasta but was kind of just satisfactory."}
{"text":"Awesomeness. We came to Fat Ox on a Friday night at the end of August - a group of 7. The restaurant is gorgeous at night, filled with glass and softly lit. The bathroom is lovely old school tiles, smells serene (seriously) and has a solid soundtrack thumping. The food was the star - everything was excellent :
- Cheese and Meat plate: fresh and interesting 
- Veal meatballs - light and flavorful
- Pastas - AMAZING and made in house they were unique and really good
- Whole chicken - fantastic with grey smiley flavor and hot sauce
- Porter House - butter yummyness 

The service was very friendly and knowledgeable - especially with wine recommendations and the choices are great - especially a great wine of the glass list. That said it does take time for the service to ramp up and so there are some inconsistent wait times. Overall - great spot!"}
{"text":"From the first encounter at the host stand to the very end of the meal, we had a wonderful experience here. Our waiters Keenan and Elijah went above and beyond to make our evening great. They kept up with our jokes, were very personable, polite and professional. Get the Caesar to start FORSURE, they make it table-side and it is such amazing flavors combined. I went with the chicken dish and was amazed at the portion and the extreme flavors that was presented in the dish.  My parents went with the waygoo filets and said it was the best they have had. We finished the dinner with the lemon tart and tiramisu....so decadent. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for after work drinks and bite.   I love the atmosphere, service is great and food is delicious too.  I also love the small plates, great for sharing or a light bite.  Wine list is excellent too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely outstanding!!!  From the food, to the presentation, to the service, the wine list and the staff.... fantastic!!!  I have several food allergies, and they were so accommodating.  My meal was one of the best I have had to date since we moved to Scottsdale 2.5 years ago, and we eat out constantly!  We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Fat Ox last week with my husband for date night and to celebrate my birthday which was great! Our server Isabel created a tasting menu which gave us a good overview of their menu. She knocked it out of the park with service and we'll definitely be back. We had the burrata, lamb verde, and scallops which were all delicious. The only complaint is the seating arrangement- It was a bit tight. Ok, one more complaint- the house bread is not very good. A fluffy focaccia with olive oil would be much better than the oil soaked toasted crouton."}
{"text":"Ambiance is lively and the space is open with the main dining area and then the smaller bar area.

Service is TOP notch SUPER welcoming and friendly.

I had the cauliflower and Salmon dish and both came out VERY quickly..maybe cuz I was at the bar and by myself? 

Cauliflower has a nice spicy kick to it.. but not too spicy.


The crispy salmon was cooked to perfection and tasty ..the skin was nice and crispy..just as you would expect! 

I plan on coming here again..this was my first visit and I was here on a business trip. 

Thomas the bartender..awesome."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have written a negative review. I am not one to complain often, but this restaurant warrants this review for so many different reasons. 

To summarizes our experience in one word: disappointing. I took my mom here because she loves Zinc Bistro, by the same chef Matt Carter. This restaurant looked and sounded so amazing, branding itself as \"modern Italian\". 

As soon as we walked in the door, we really wanted to like it. It's modern fixtures and buzzing atmosphere seemed promising. However, our table was late and the hostesses were visibly disorganized and loudly discussing issues they were having. Our table was strangely placed near a party so large, we had to move tables in the restaurant during our first course just to hear each other across the table.

Sadly, the worst part was the food. We got the mussel antipasta (recommended), the burrata, the Rosso crest di Gallo (pasta) and the rigatoni lamb verde. The mussels were immensely over salted, not fresh at all and the sauce had such a high amount of acid it overpowered anything else in the dish. The burrata was severely under salted, with no vehicle on which to eat it, it was a strange dish. Both the pastas were extremely salty, high in fat and way over cooked. The rigatoni had pickles in it which was very strange. 

To sum up the atmosphere and food: trying too hard, overdone, confusing.

Our one saving grace was our server Mary, who was nice enough to take our pastas off our bill, and did so with genuine sincerity. 

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, even though it sounds so good. The overall execution of service, food and organization left much to be desired and did not deliver what we expected at all."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and there weren't many options to have a full meal. Burrata was great, but FYI, comes with a prosciutto garnish. The waiter knew I was veg but didn't say anything about the meat on the dish. The pasta course is allegedly made for sharing, but there were 8-10 pieces on the plate. My husband and I decided to split an order and were dumbfounded when it came out. The kitchen was very backed up and there wasn't an opportunity to put in an additional order. I sat through the rest of the meal while the other three folks at the table had their own entrees. The waiter seemed to be annoyed and frustrated by our questions about portion size, etc. Good wine and craft cocktails. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"My experience at the Fat Ox was a mixed bag of good, bad and just awful (I got food poisoning from their Scallops). The evening started out great, our server Eric was great and seemed attentive (initially), he walked us through the menu and gave some recommendations of what dishes were great and gave a couple cocktail recommendations. He took our order and then basically disappeared the entire evening outside of us flagging him down for a cocktail and the very very seldom \"everything good\" check-in. It kind of seemed like a lot of other staff were picking up his slack.

Per Eric's recommendation I tried the Navigation cocktail which is made with ketel one vodka, chamomile, lemon juice, Chartreuse. It is served up with an egg white foam on top. The cocktail was great but the bartender gave me a cocktail full of ice chips which was frustrating and really took away from the cocktail. I personally find it super unappealing and frustrating to get a cocktail with bits of ice floating when the drink  is meant to be served up. I also tried their Sicilian Sunset (Stoli vodka, Lillet Rose, passion fruit), I really enjoyed it. It was sweet but not too sweet; I found it to be pretty perfectly balanced. I would for sure order that again. 

Now on to the food, we ordered the following items from their 4 course price fixe menu 

Antipasti:
:: Calabrian Cauliflower, Barolo Salami, Fennel and Arugula
:: Bellweather Farms Ricotta, Prosciutto, Shaved Trumpet Mushrooms and Hazelnut

Primi Piatti:
:: Ricotta Cavatelli, Pulled Chicken, Rosso Vin Cotto, Caper, Olive and Almond
:: Squid Ink Linguine, Fennel, Tomato, Pork Sugo, Preserved Lemon and Bottarga

Secondi Piatti:
:: Short Rib Alla Vaccinara, Barolo Agrodolce, Celery Puree, Charred Broccolini
:: La Belle Farms Duck Breast, Horseradish Creamed Leek, Potato, Blackberry
:: Maine Diver Scallop, Fregola, Cotechino, Preserved Lemon, Almonds

Dessert:
:: Gianduja Grangelico Tiramisu, Roasted Banana, Espresso Gelato
:: Meyer Lemon Semifreddo, Lambrousco Strawberry. Chiffon

For the first course, I really enjoyed both dishes. The Cauliflower was really the true standout, the Bellweather Farms Ricotta was delicious but I felt like it needed some form of texture. The prosiutto and the shaved trumpet mushrooms had really similar constancies and I just felt like they got lost a little bit in the ricotta, it needed some salt too... It would have really benefited from a sprinkling of some Maldon salt. 

For the second course both the Ricotta Cavatelli and the Squid ink linguine were both perfectly cooked. The Ricotta Cavatelli was my favorite out of the two dishes, just a ton of great flavors going on in that dish. The Squid ink linguine again kinda lacked flavor, it really kind of fell flat. The couple of squid rings served with it were super overcooked as well.   

For the Second Piatti, the Short Rib again was the standout - I felt like I was eating my friends dinner more than mine. They were perfectly braised, fall apart delicious, I wish they had served more of the celery root puree with it! 

I initially got the La Belle Farms Duck Breast, but it was so overcooked that honestly it was almost inedible and (again) lacked any flavor. They basically cut up a couple of blackberries and put them on the dish and there wasn't really any sauce to try and add to the duck. Thankfully, a server (not ours) saw that I wasn't really eating the dish and asked if I was enjoying it. He was kind enough to bring me a replacement dish (the scallops). As soon as they brought the scallops out, they smelled fishy and when I tried one they tasted SUPER fishy. Fishy smell and taste with a shell fish is never a good thing. Lo and behold last night.... I got SICK. 

The deserts were good, the Tiramisu was great but the Meyer Lemon Semifreddo didn't have any of that tart lemon flavor. 

So some of the dishes were great, the portions were adequate - not huge but not tiny like some people have suggested. We did have bouts of great service, but unfortunately it wasn't from our server. Eric was MIA most of the evening, we hardly saw him and when you have a missing server it really is just a bummer. It takes away from the meal, but that's me... I'd eat mediocre food all day long if the service is amazing. I am bummed that I got sick from the scallops, kind of a bad way to end an evening. 

Would I come back... I don't know. It's hard to look past the super spotty bordering on bad service and getting sick at the end of the evening. But I am intrigued because some of the dishes were great and I would be interested in trying more (maybe not order fish in the future? IDK)."}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE! This is a new restaurant in town so I guess they do deserve the buzz? The decor is nice and modern. They served modern Italian food with smaller portions and bigger price tags than some of the other restaurants. 

The food was good but not sure if they are worth the price tags. They do try to convince you to order at least 3 courses (4 with desserts) because they are tapas styles and meant to be shared. 

$15 for table side Caesar salad - it was good and can be served with anchovies and fried capers.

Ravioli was $15 and it came in 5-6 small pieces. 

Black squid pasta $18 - one of the better dishes they have. 

6 oz filet $45 was served with potato side dish. The cheapest meat on the menu. They have another cut of meat for $110! 

Scallops $35 and it came with 4 pieces. Not worth it in my personal opinion. I had way better scallops in other restaurants.

Tiramisu $8 - it was a small sliver of tiramisu. Decent but nothing spectacular. 

Anyways, prepare to spend at least $100/person."}
{"text":"Being Italian and from New Jersey, I've been to many wonderful Italian restaurants in my life, but Fat Ox was an original  gastronomic experience for sure! I had never tasted prosciutto that was so tender. Squid ink pappardelle with laughing bird shrimp and calamari had more flavor than seems legal. The Garganellii pasta with speck was out of this world. And don't even get me started on the amazingly tender scallops that melted like butter in my mouth. Elijah Davis was working the room and made a Caesar salad that just oozed of his showmanship and love. He made the whole night so special! And our waiter Richie and the manager Darva went out of their way as well and made us feel like VIPs. When Elijah insisted on coffee and dessert I thought I would explode but it was well worth it! Again the BEST tiramisu I have ever eaten. Even the bread with the whipped ricotta and cheesy butter was a special touch. An hour spent after dinner enjoying a top-quality bourbon at the bar with bartender Britney was a most pleasant way to top off a great evening. She is a pleasure to chat with. Run, don't walk, to Fat Ox when you want a meal and an evening that will surely stand out in your memory. And if you're lucky, Elijah Davis will be working that night and amaze you!"}
{"text":"After only being open for 5 weeks the place is a home run. We got a tour through the kitchen which is impeccable. The Ceasar salad is a must. Prepared table side and awesome. The skirt steak is awesome."}
{"text":"HECK YES !!!  Our first trial and it was a home run.  We have a list of restaurants we want to try now that the snowbirds have left and Fat Ox was a great start to our summer !

But we warned, this is not your Mom's typical Italian home cooking.  Don't go here if your looking for old fashion spaghetti !  This is Modern Italian Cuisine and is it good!  Very complex flavors and textures.  Interesting restaurant design but I would imagine the volume would get pretty cranked up when the place is packed.  Looked like an up scale crowd even during the non-snowbird season.

Service was great, Thanks Canton, and all the staff was very friendly - everyone wished us a good night as we left as if they all served us.  

Great food, nice staff - what else could you want ?"}
{"text":"Went here for a belated Valentine's Day date with my wife as she was out of town working on the day..
We were seated on the patio, which was very nice, but the heaters were way too hot! Also the tables are just TOO close together. We couldn't have a quiet 'private' conversation due to the extremely close proximity of our 4 dining neighbors (who were also quite loud).
Food was really great - nice portions and very well presented. Our waitress & waitress-in-training was lovely - cant remember her name but they were both very attentive.
Table-side caesar salad was very nice, but not enough - was a little small on the serve. Could have definitely had a larger serve because it tasted great!
Wine list is very good, has a little too much US wine (which is fine, but if you want an international wine listen, don't be afraid to thin the herd a little) but a good Italian range also, limited wines from other great wine countries (2 from Australia only that I counted).
After chatting with our waitress, she told us about the happy hour and taster options which sounds pretty good - we will defiantly be back again.."}
{"text":"Incredible food, awkward service. We started with a salad, then each got a pasta dish, and finished with the sea scallops. Everything about the food was spot on; we loved the flavors and how everything was cooked. No complaints at all about the food! The service on the other hard was difficult to understand. Our waiter seemed disengaged and did not really seem to understand what we wanted from him as a server. He continued to talk about the dishes that we did not have questions about and would interrupt at very odd times. I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars because the food was delicious, but the service needs some work. If I could recommend anything, I would say: wait until the guests ask questions before providing suggestions and always ask for drink orders before giving the overview of the food. Overall, it was a good experience, but not great."}
{"text":"The other night I went to Fat Ox for the first time and my oh my was I impressed! The concept is modern, yet so classic at the same time. I have to admit, I was a little uneasy about trying this place... But thanks to their stellar staff, my visit could not have been better. The idea here is to break up your meal into five courses. If you miss this key point, your experience will certainly lack. With that being said, the prices on this menu can add up fast if you don't share with those at your table. My friends and I chose to share with the table for the starting courses and \"buddy up\" with one other for the entree portion of the meal.

Many told us we HAD to try the table side caesar salad - so that's exactly what we did. The gentleman making it for us had suggested that we don't take the anchovies out like we requested. We went out on a limb with this one and we were all so glad that we did! It was ah-mazing! Next, we ordered the bellwether farms ricotta board for the table... Truly an excellent choice. Being a HUGE fan of all foods involving butternut squash, I made sure to continue our dining experience by ordering the casoncelli pasta dish. It was sweet, light, and super tasty! Like I said before, we all agreed to \"buddy up\" when it came to choosing our entrees. My friend and I shared the short rib dish which came with broccolini and an addicting special sauce on top. I knew after the first bite that I had found one of my new favorite restaurants... It was THAT good.

I truly cannot wait to come back to Fat Ox and explore their menu further. My biggest advice if it is your first time going - keep an open mind the entire night! Many things on the menu may intimidate you, but don't let that happen or you'll miss out on the unique dishes this place has to offer. And last but not least, if you are unsure, ask the staff questions! Our server and wait staff was SO friendly and willing to talk about our wants and concerns!"}
{"text":"$5 valet when every place in town is free? Really? Anyways - onto the inside.. Slower service than expected, couldn't believe a 7:00 reservation for restaurant week had us finally leaving at after 9:30. Table side Caesar salad - great idea however we were asked if we were ok with several ingredients that were not even in the salad. Where was the cheese, garlic, pepper? Disappointment. It was very hard to converse at our table, the volume inside was so loud. Drinks took ages, the place was not that busy. All in all, there are better places that are cheaper that offer much better service."}
{"text":"We've hear great things about Fat Ox, so thought with out of town guests it would be a good time to try it. The pretentiousness was overwhelming. The hostesses were not welcoming or simply kind! Which is not the way to treat anyone. We asked if there was an open table in the bar and all 3 of the ladies at the hostess stand Pointed to a corner table. It must have been too far for them to show us the table. It took an uncomfortably long time just to get water. The waitress finally showed up and her demeanor was not pleasant, a smile would have gone a long way. We were planning on eating but it was obvious that we were not welcome. We did order a round of wine which was good. To bad that the service was not at a higher standard. The area has far too many choices of eating establishment to waste money on restaurants that aren't trying to make patrons welcome. Being kind, welcoming, & friendly cost nothing, but your business!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the table side Caesar Salad- it's fun to watch them make the dressing from scratch. The taste is fabulous and lemony and I love the capers with it.

We got the short rib and scallops. The short rib is cooked for 10+ hours and is served with smokey charred broccolini. The beef is slightly sweet, but has a great meaty flavor. The scallops are sushi grade and seared. It's served with mushrooms, brussel sprouts. I loved the buttery scallops with the bitter balsamic sauce. Fat Ox is perfect for celebrating, date night or happy hour."}
{"text":"Decor and ambiance is nice. Menu and wine list were thorough and thoughtful. However, the food was just okay. 
Coming in from out of town many people recommended us to go go Fat Ox. The hype did not live up to the experience. The service was pretty good, our server was friendly and explained the menu well, but there were long waits at times. Presentation of the table side Cesar was impressive but tasted generic. 
We asked to be reseated after getting a table next to the service station. When we asked if we could sit at the two open tables around us, we were rudely told they were specifically reserved. We were seated on the patio which ended up being wonderful because it was a nice night. However, there was no light outside so we could not see what we were eating.  
Overall, we were underwhelmed with the experience as a whole and will not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Was just at Fat Ox for my first Mother's Day as a soon to be mom, with my my fiancé for dinner. We called ahead to get a reservation and they said they had a table for us. When we arrived we were seated right away but wasn't greater by anyone after we sat. We waited for waters before we started to look at the menu...those didn't come. So we finally looked and after deciding on our drinks, apps, and entrees after having some questions. We still had not received any waters or greetings to let us know they would be right with us. We looked around for a waiter and was not given any attention. So we left...very disappointed."}
{"text":"Fat Ox is so delicious.  The service is amazing.  The bar is cool and hip  Its family style so know that you will be ordering large portions"}
{"text":"While I wasn't able to enjoy the full course sets due to my daughter getting tired, we really enjoyed the veal meatballs, fingerling potatoes and mozzarella da buffala for the appetizers. My picky eater of a son enjoyed an entire helping of Gigli as well as my mother while my wife and I enjoyed the Ricotta Cavatelli as well as some Gigli. Both amazingly delicious along with the appetizers. Then we had to skip to dessert which was 3 Tiramisu and one pistachio gelato that my son was over the moon for and wanted to know why this was so much better than regular ice cream. If you have the time for an amazing course dinner and seeking Italian. This is the place."}
{"text":"If you haven't been go. The lamb will wow you. The porterhouse great to share. Our server Timo was the best I've ever had. He was genuine and caring. It was like he was having us over for dinner at his own house! This meal would be my last if I only had one left to eat. Drink water has founded a local treasure for all to enjoy. I felt like absolute royalty and you will too if you eat here. Please. Please. Please. I you want to feel like kings and queens then you need to eat at the Fat Ox. Wow. Wow. Wow."}
{"text":"We walked into this restaurant and it was beautiful.  We had made reservations for a Sunday night and arrived on time.  We were told that there were would be a 15 minute wait...even though half the restaurant was empty.  We waited at the bar and ordered a drink.  It was very well made, however, it was $17.  We finally got seated and it took about 10 minutes before we were greeted by the waiter.  We placed our order and everything came out in a timely manner.  The food was delicious and well portioned for the price.  Overall, the food was great but service could improve.  Drinks are slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night for girls night out.  4 of us had a wonderful time.   Foods were great.   The pastas and steak were delicious.  We finished with tiramisu.  I have to mention our waitress (I wish I remember her name) was fantastic.  She is so friendly with a sense of humor!  She recommended us one of the red wine.  We opened a bottle and ended up getting two more glasses.  I will def go back again."}
{"text":"My mother had set up a reservation for a party of 4 for 12/11 @ 6:15 PM. On Sunday, she called to double check her reservation time was told flat out \"no, we are not going to be open tonight.We're doing construction\" Confused, she asked why the hell no one called her and told her this. The hostess then stated: \"Oh, we though we had the wrong area code so we didn't call..\" Im sorry but what restaurant DOESN'T call someone to let them know their reservation will be canceled because they thought the area code was wrong? She still has her Denver cell # since she moved out here a while ago. Needless to say, we not be dining here. Luckily, Steak44 made room for us at 6:00PM. I HIGHLY recommended going to Steak44 instead of this place. From the other reviews...it's not worth it. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"AZ Restaurant Week enticed my dining partner and I to try this trendy hot spot. LOVED IT! We had Opentable 7:30 Saturday reservations. When we arrived we were greeted and seated right away. Canteen R was our excellent server, explaining all the new and existing dishes being offered.

We started off with cocktails: a Cosmo which was excellent and Martinis. We chose to dine off the AZ Restaurant week menu choosing the Tagliatelle, Scallop Crudo, Jidori Chicken, Skirt Steak, ending with the Pistachio Gelato and the Panna Cotta. There was a mix up in drinks and we were offered the Cauliflower side and a comped Cosmo.

The food was wonderful, excellent Tagliatelle and Scallops. The Chicken came with this tangy hot sauce... so good. The skirt steak done to my ordered medium rare. I will say I am not a fan of the new cauliflower trend, but the comped dish made me try and OMG I'm a lover now. The Pistachio Gelato was excellent. The weakest dish was my Panna Cotta dessert.

Great dining experience, I'm glad I tried on the  AZ Restaurant Week. A bit pricey especially cocktails, but it won't deter me from coming back though.

Atmosphere: Trendy, Service: excellent, Food: excellent."}
{"text":"Yummmmm came here on a Monday and had a great dinner.. had a duo wait staff!  Great Bib salad and pasta dishes.. will be back home when back here..."}
{"text":"Excellent experience! We came to fat ox to try out the food during restaurant week. We were not disappointed, it was insanely good food and service. Ayla (bartender) was our server and she could not have been any better. Knowledgeable, responsive and had excellent recommendations. We had several different options the- burrata with the pork belly wow outstanding- not super fatty just super meaty. Had a few of the hh pastas - tortellini was best bite of the night in my opinion. My husband had the brick chicken it was delicious!!!! Moist with lots of cool things that you could add - aioli, hot sauce etc. We also had the gigli which my mom loved, and the skirt steak. We were all highly impressed with the restaurant and couldn't say enough about our food and service. I would come back just for Ayla..... but now we know the food is amazing also!!! Thanks for impressing some tough diners!"}
{"text":"Absolute disappointment! Service was poor and food was worse. Waiter didn't crack a smile all night and had    to go ask someone else to answer each question we asked. I had difficulty chewing the tough steak and had to leave a mouth full in the napkin. Portions were lean. Interior decorating was high end but layout was labyrinthal. This is an honest review of my experience. I'm not a basher at all, but it really was a huge disappointment especially as the whole experience did not match the prices ( $110 for porterhouse )."}
{"text":"This is definitely a favorite for my husband and I! Perfect for any date night, girls night out, or celebration. From service to food i would give this restaurant a 5+ stars. Our second time there the manager even said to us \"welcome back great to see you guys again!\" I mean that sure does go a long way in terms of customer service! Our servers both times have been phenomenal and never made us felt rushed or pushed throughout dinner! 

If you are looking for a cool hip vibe away from the suburb life, this is definitely a must go to! 

Be sure to try the Gigli pasta! So Delicious!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal literally more restaurants should model themselves after this spot. 

The vibe is right whether you are meeting a person or two at the hightops by the bar, dining with a large group in the backroom, on front or back garden patio or in the main dining room. 

Our booth was half blue leather and half denim, so edgy and comfy. Our wait staff team was pleasant and fairly attentive. 

Hats off to the table side Caesar salad maker, it's the most incredible salad I've ever had. Literally you cannot come to this restaurant and not order this. It's an absolute .  

Next up, the hand made in house pastas. There is a good variety of shapes, sizes, and flavors for you to order from with and or without meats. I was hesitant with the speck in mine  the Gargelli which  was a truffle butter taste. You could feel the ridges on your tounge with every bite and the perfect parmesan droppings. 

My dining partner ordered the squid ink pasta with shrimp. Seafood was fresh with a nice taste that didn't overpower the pasta but complimented it nicely. 

The ribeye was delicious. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Sorry but this was terrible !! Service so so slow ... food at best mediocre !! Very expensive.. Probably the worst Caesar salad I've ever had ...nice young man making said he had no idea what he was doing .. he had watched the other guys make & they were running behind so he was helping ! two pasta dishes plain stone cold ! Has a nice atmosphere.. beautiful setting & dinning/ bar area ..  but food maybe the worst in the valley ... !!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend for our anniversary. Since it was restaurant week, we opted in for the $44 per person menu. We got to choose an appetizer, main course and dessert each. We started ourselves with wine and the complimentary bread. The bread was olive oil, rosemary tasting with a side of spicy dip or olive oil cheese. We were both a fan of the bread and the cheese dip! Yum! We then started with our appetizers: scallops crudo & burrata di bufala which were both good but nothing exceptional. The scallops were really thin pieces and the burrata di bufala was also small bites but the taste was more unique and impressional. For the mains, we had: Ora king salmon & short rib vaccinara. The short rib was god and so was the salmon, but not impressionable either. However, they were still decent and tasted good, so it was solid. For desserts, we ended with: lemon panna cotta & gianduja franjelico tiramisu - the tiramisu didn't taste like the usual moist ones I e had, but I liked it a lot! The toasted banana bits and chocolates weren't overpowering to each other nor was it too sweet, a fan of it and would recommend to order. As for the lemon panna cotta, it was good too so not a bad choice to order either. We got pleasantly surprised with two glasses of complimentary champagne for our anniversary which was very sweet of the restaurant. Overall, solid and decent."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday at Fat Ox.  It was a wonderful experience and the food was excellent.  Our waiter, Cantenn, not only made our first visit to Fat Ox special, he celebrated my birthday as if I were part of the family.  It is a spendy restaurant but the service and food were worth the expense.  As we left, who I assume may have been the manager, he held the door open for my husband and me and wished me a Happy Birthday.  He was not a part of my direct wait staff so I was pleasantly surprised that he was so attentive to his customers, recognizing I was celebrating a birthday.  I would definitely go back and I would request Cantenn as our waiter.  I would recommend reservations!"}
{"text":"My son started up at ASU and asked if we could dine there based on the Chef being on Chopped Grill Masters.  The food, service, ambiance, cocktails were all awesome.  We had Canton as our server and his attention to detail and knowledge of the wine list and menu were impressive.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super disappointing experience. Dinner last night, six of us 5:45PM, reserved a patio table (never realizing the neglect we'd receive from sitting the furthest from the kitchen!!) Our waiter was polite but extremely SLOW & very inattentive...Muscles & cauliflower appetizer 2 start our dining experience took 35min to deliver, & rather than explaining that he perhaps forgot to submit the order, he merely said \"the kitchen is so busy, sorry for the delay\"  A swordfish dish ordered was terribly overcooked & the ribs delivered were ICE COLD... (These guests are extremely low maintenance I might add) & in brief mention to our waiter, he elected to \"re-order\" the ribs in hopes they were warmer, & left the swordfish to be literally untouched. The ribs arrived  when everyone else had completed their meal, only to be placed in a to-go box!!! A glass of pricey champagne was served in a wine glass, (the flute glass serves a purpose in retaining the bubbles) We were told the bartender was young & felt like all champagne was Proseco (lame explanation) The server realized our disappointment & offered to comp desert!!! Considering our bill was over $700. (Lots of great wine consumed) it would seem complimentary desert was the least one could do to salvage a bad experience.... Luckily, it was several close friends enjoying each-others company but sadly, not the restaruant. Unfortunate because the ambiance & location is terrific, we won't be returning... I wish now I had paid closer attention to a review I had read in Trends magazine that was not positive."}
{"text":"Incredible food unbelievable wine menu!!!  What a great 40th birthday for one of  my good friends!!  I met Mark and Brian the owners fantastic group of people.  Thx Fat Ox!!

12-10-17
Once again fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. Waitstaff first rate. Decor beautiful. 
Arrived on time for our reservation, but waited nearly 1 hour past our reservation time to be seated. Finally seated at table next to the bar, where noise level made conversation impossible. Beyond embarrassed to take out of town guests out for a nice dinner.  
My previous experiences at Fat Ox were wonderful. This was far from it."}
{"text":"Italian dining at its best. Freshly made pasta with flavor profiles that will awaken your taste buds.

Love that everything is served as course for family style dining, upscale dining that is!

The space is decorated beautifully and the service impeccable.

Everything was cooked to perfection, highly recommend the scallops and braised short ribs.

But save room for dessert, their tiramisu is one of the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Food is so flavorful and outside of this world. We had a party of 25 and the servers were so hands on and fast. The best items are the linguini and the 8 oz creek stone fillet with extra mushroom sauce. This restaurant and the mission are tied to be my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"An absolutely incredible restaurant, from food, to service, to ambiance. 

We were looking for modern Italian for one of our nights in Scottsdale, and Fat Ox presented our ideal restaurant. With a modern-rustic-chic interior, this upscale restaurant welcomed you to some of the best dining in Arizona. 

Practically every dish we ordered was a home run, including presentation. From a delicious Caesar salad made table-side, to fresh mozzarella, to handmade pastas. The ribeye and salmon were also favorites. I honestly don't have enough space to outline every dish, but  just know that everything you order, especially if you like it normally, will be incredible from the Fat Ox. I'm glad I came with a group of 6 so that I had the chance to try as much of the menu as possible! 

Our waiter also truly elevated the meal even further. He struck the perfect balance between attentiveness, conversation, and impeccable and professional service. We chose every dish he recommended, and he kept our glasses of both water and wine full without us even noticing. 

Overall an amazing meal! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this new place.  The food is fantastic and the ambiance is great.  Make sure to try the lamb verde pasta   The tiramisu is the best in town. You won't be disappointed.  Mark and Brian were very welcoming and took great care of us.  The bar scene on the weekends is great and they have plenty of tvs."}
{"text":"I had the lamb here as I love lamb.  It was AMAZING!!!  All I can say is wow.   I will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Time and time again these guys do restaurants and their menus in their own unique ways, and again they are nothing short of excellent. Congratulations FatOx crew for delivering on all fronts of the dining experience."}
{"text":"Really cute spot! The long international wine menu is interesting and atmosphere is fun. 
I went for dinner but I would bet this is a fun happy hour spot.
Ordered the tableside Cesar salad which might sound like a regular boring salad, but it was the best Cesar salad I've had. YUM. 
Also got whatever their version of the meat and cheese platter is. I'm never huge into these, but if you are, they had good quality meats. 
Something to be aware of-  their portions are fairly small - not huge portions that most \"Italian\" restaurants serve. 
Definitely worth checking out if you've never been."}
{"text":"Ignore the name!

Wonderful spot. Great bar area. Great drink menu, beautiful well thought out decor and stellar upscale, delightful menu.  Hate the TV in the bar, but I guess that is just a Phoenix thing. 

Not a casual spot, which is a nice change.   Love a nice, upscale place! Thank you Fat Ox. 

Well done!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to the Fat Ox last night for the 2017 NYE celebration with a lovely prix fixe menu. 

Our reservation was for 7pm - early enough in the evening to relax through each course and savor our food. And that we did for the first 3! 

We were ushered in warmly, like family, and seated in a back dining room, which had a nice, intimate feeling.

From the prix fixe menu, I selected the table side Caesar salad, green tortellini, the Creekside filet, and the Meyer lemon tart.

The Caesar salad is made to order at your table, and they take into consideration all your preferences - if you're squirrelly about raw eggs, don't want anchovies, etc. My salad was perfect - the lettuce was crisp, dressing was tangy yet not overpowering, and dressed perfectly. 

The tortellini, too, was flavorful. The pasta was al dente, ricotta filling creamy but not watery, and the presentation was beautiful - colorful & tempting.

My filet was cooked just as I'd requested - medium. It was tender and juicy. The porcini cream and gravy enhanced the flavored of the meat nicely. Everyone was happy with their main courses, except one if us, who ordered the short ribs. (She felt that although the seasoning and glaze was flavorful, the meat was rubbery - it wouldn't cut.) Our other friend, who ordered the guinea hen, loved her meal.

I liked the ambiance as a whole. Up to our receiving our main plates, our service was lovely - the delivery of our food was timed perfectly, the waitstaff attentive but not intrusive, etc. All the accoutrements made for a lovely experience - flatware had a nice weight, lighting felt warm & inviting, there are a lot of airy & open spaces, and the decor a blend of old & new.

As we were savoring our main courses, the live band began their first set. It seemed out of nowhere that the volume in the back dining room exploded - it was simply too loud. My table mates & I couldn't hear those sitting next to us in conversation, and there was no option to speak to anyone across the table, as the volume was too loud. We had to repeat ourselves in conversation constantly (none of us have hearing issues.)

After five or so songs, the lead singer began belting out Jennifer Hudson-like notes, which unfortunately weren't delivered as Jennifer Hudson would.  Nevertheless, the music could've been digestible had it simply been lower in volume.

Sadly, the music volume shifted the tone on our entire dining experience.
After serving the first 3 courses and being perfectly attentive, our server went missing. It became apparent why - although we'd preordered our desserts at 7:30, they'd somehow sold out. Three of us ordered the Meyer lemon tarts (evidently most people eating last night did!), one ordered the olive oil cake, and the last ordered the tiramisu.

I assume our server didn't know how to mitigate the issue, thus opted to ignore us until we asked where our desserts were. Finally the olive oil cake and tiramisu were delivered, but with extra random, small bowls of gelato. As she delivered these desserts, our server did not acknowledge our missing tarts, thus we sat there looking at the gelato in confusion and disinterest. The three of us who'd pre-ordered the tarts finally flagged another server down (ours went missing again,) to inquire the status of our promised desserts. 

So, as we sat perplexed in the status of our tarts, those who received the cake & tiramisu shared theirs.

The tiramisu was very good - the person in our party who ordered it, loved it. The olive oil cake was dense. The taste and texture reminded me more of a bread than a cake. It was served with orange gelato, which helped offset the density, while also add some much needed flavor. I think I'd have liked the olive oil cake if it had been made with citrus peel. But without such a pop of flavor, the cake to me, tasted too bland.

We were also promised an Amaro in the prix fixe menu, which didn't come until we inquired about its status. 

In the end, the gelato sat almost untouched - I tasted them just to test the flavors. There was pistachio, espresso, and amaretto. Pistachio is my favorite gelato, but this one had a faint, almost indistinguishable pistachio flavor, which is a shame. The amaretto, too, wasn't strong, but the espresso was very distinguishable. The gelato was definitely rich & creamy, but alas, I'm not a fan of gelato in the wintertime.

So, the latter half of the evening felt as though we were micromanaging the delivery of an agreed-to contract and being placated with boring alternatives. That's unfortunate, because the first half of the dinner was delightfully phenomenal.

We chalked the negative experiences up to their being a new restaurant, and not yet having worked out their kinks. The bad news is that what went wrong, was handled sophomorically. But the great news is that they got half the evening more than right. And in the end, I'll go back for that Caesar alone."}
{"text":"Overall impression is that it has potential.  Will maybe go back in a year or two if they survive.  Cool atmosphere and great interior design.  Food was good but not great.  Had some potato appetizer which was quite small.  The cavatelli pasta dish was excellent.  The salmon and risotto was good, not great, but there was an awful odor from whatever the hell else was on that plate.  Kept thinking the fish was bad but it wasn't he fish.  And my nose is all congested and I could still smell it. 

The service was not great.  Took a while for server to show up then drinks took a while.  They like to take the entire food order at once which is fine but I think he forgot to put in the order.  The appetizer took forever and table next to us who ordered after us, got there's 10 minutes before ours.  They have limited beer section.  Didn't order wine.  Wife and I were both a little tired so ordered a latte after appetizer.  That took a while and didn't bring us any sugar.  After pasta, I wanted another beer which waiter never brought, but didn't charge for either.   Never saw the waiter after the pasta.  Someone brought the salmon dish and our server never came back to the table.  Another server finally got us our check.  Our server was probably somewhat new but someone should have supervising him better."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Went for appetizers/ happy hour at the bar. Old fashion was good. We got the hanger steak and Burrata with butternut quash. Both were excellent--hanger steak cooked perfectly medium rare. Only complaint would be the service was a little bit slow. Will def be back for actual dinner."}
{"text":"I was there for the VIP opening last week and was very impressed.  Everything was perfect. Did happen to miss out on the lamb however so a return trip is in the the near future"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you can see how beautiful the restaurant is. The bar and table settings were gorgeous. My first annoyance was, we were a party of 4 with a 5th coming to join us for a drink later in the evening. There were 2 corner tables for parties of 5 and we asked if we could take one of those and were told they were reserved. I waited all night to see if that was true and it was not!! We had to squeeze ourselves in to a small table for 4.

We had several of the cheese platters, the caesars, which was ridicoulously small even for 1 person, several of the pastas and the porterhouse steak with the several sides, one being the polenta, which was dry and the other being overly cooked mushrooms.

The best things on the menu are definetly the pastas, the waiter did say they were house made.

We had 2 bottles of wine and the sommelier was extremly personable. My biggest complaint about this restaurant was our waiter. He was extremely pushy, we really only wanted a couple of things from each course and he was beyond insistent that was not going ot be ok. after getting our first course very quickly he came over once again and asked us if we were ready to put in our order for more food. We said we would put our order in for our 2nd course and if we could have some time eo decide on the next courses. He said no I really need to take it all now. Since we were not quite ready, he stood over our table while we contemplated a good 5-7 minutes on what we wanted. SUPER ANNOYING!!!

We were visinting from Los Angeles, I will definetly not go back, however I hope for the sake of such a beautiful location, they will make it work."}
{"text":"What we enjoyed: Caesar salad (definitely my favorite) aged prosciutto (even though it didn't seem very different to other prosciutto), their pasta 

Things that were ok: veal meatballs

What we disliked: Our pork was so dry it was inedible & portions were tiny

Amazing atmosphere for a drink but probably wouldn't eat there again unless it was for a snack"}
{"text":"Walking in - beautiful decor, very tasteful entry sequence, warm wood furniture and a buzzing atmosphere. HOWEVER, the wall adjacent to hostess stand is adorned with framed photos of disembodied female parts. Legs, butts, some breasts - not a single face in sight. What is this doing in such a classy and refined interior?? Wait...it gets worse! The men's restroom is filled - FILLED - with framed soft core porn. No artist name, no model name, but stock photos of nude and anonymous women. The women's restroom - similar but different. Boudoir style photos in every stall. If there's GOING to be sexy pics - how come women don't get to see boobs as well????? This is pre-WWI attitude about women on display in a way that does NOT vibe with the rest of the restaurant. It's as if the architect, interior designer, executive chef, bar and wait staff are all on one page - a page that is classy, well executed, and delicious - and the owner walked around and hung up some tactless pics to demonstrate HIS views about a women's role in the world."}
{"text":"Wife and I dined here Saturday night for a nice evening out.  Absolutely loved the experience.  We were seated in the back room but the whole restaurant had a great ambiance about it.  Great energy of people enjoying their evenings.  Our server recommended some great wine from which to choose and we enjoyed thoroughly.  All the wait staff was attentive and pleasant, recommending dishes and drinks.  We started with the mussels in red sauce (amazing), next on to squid ink pasta, and finally on to our entrees - Branzino special and the bone-in ribeye.  Both were to die for.  The ribeye came sliced into several thick slabs and melted in your mouth.  We finished with the olive oil cake and left fantastically satisfied and not uncomfortable.  To top it off, I didn't feel the price was too much for the wonderful experience.  Will certainly be back !"}
{"text":"Mediocre food with a cool vibe. Overpriced for the qualify. This place could use a new head chef. Pastas are underwhelming. Bar is fun and atmosphere is good! No food will impress you enough to pay what they're charging."}
{"text":"Great place love the atmosphere and the boost the food everything about this is super modern and fantastic. King fantastic!"}
{"text":"Fat Ox remains at the top of my list for fantastic restaurants. The pastas are freshly prepared and arguably as good, if not better that the best I have experienced in Italy. The balance of the menu is fantastic as well. Salads served table side. Deserts and entrees never disappoint. Service is exceptional.  They are attentive, but not bothersome. The environment is lively, but not overly loud. A great place to introduce anyone who has never been to Fat Ox. I have out of town guests frequently that request another visit to Fat Ox. I will be visiting again soon.
Thanks Fat Ox for the exceptional experiences."}
{"text":"Decor, service, menu and quality all \"A\"s.  Little snafu with our reservation, but an attentive and courteous staff handled it in a very acceptable and appreciated manner. If you do it right (multiple courses), it's going to get pricey fast but you kinda have to!!! Also, our server was sincerely passionate about the menu and offered up some great advice. Can't wait to go back as there were several other items that I can't wait to try. Great spot."}
{"text":"Overall a great experience for a relatively large group of people some who had very specific requests for modifications to the regular menu. I had the Short Rib Alla Vaccinara - Barolo agro dolce, celery, charred broccolini, raisin and it was awesome. It was as tender as short rib should be but came with a slightly crunchy outer layer cooked to perfection. Service was great and the place has a really nice layout that made conversation and movement possible without being crammed too tightly together."}
{"text":"Went to one of the opening events with a friend and was amazed!! As a devout carnivore, the ribeye and flank steak were straight out of my dreams. Seriously, the next time I am at that intersection and in need of steak perfection, pass on Flemings and head straight for the Fat Ox. Not to be out done, the pasta and apps were on point as well. The space is beautiful too. They also gave us a Lambrusco wine which is my new obsession. Finally, our server was so nice, he offered up to box up the bone on the ribeye for my dog!!! How nice! Great place. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This review is primarily about the female server we had Friday evening.  She was amazing. Quick, friendly and thoughtful. I have never had anyone put a napkin on the floor so my purse would not get dirty (may not sound like much, but I thought it was very thoughtful right ladies?)

The portions seemed bigger than usual, thanks!!!  They change up their pasta dishes regularly, and they are always on point."}
{"text":"Disappointing! The front staff is great and the ambience is really nice. And that's all the great things that you're going to experience. We ordered a Caesar salad, which was very bland. Nothing like you would expect a Caesar salad to be.  We ordered the Buratta, and a couple of pastas that were okay. Nothing worth the price of them. We then ordered the filet steak, which tasted like it was burnt, and honestly I feel you could get a better cut of meat from whole foods than this place. With our state came out of side which our waiter never told us about and it tasted like vomit. By this point we were hoping the desserts would be so good that it may make up for the meal. Unfortunately we were wrong. We ordered the olive oil cake and the tiramisu. The olive oil cake had way too much orange flavor to it and the tiramisu was more of a chocolate brownie on the bottom with a cheesecake layering on top then a traditional Italian tiramisu. Then we ordered some cappuccinos and after one and a half sips we were done. I asked the waiter did we order espresso's, he said no they were cappuccinos. The service we got was very poor, they don't tell you about sides to meals and their overall guidance for you for the evening for your first time there is very underwhelming. All in all we will not be returning, even if they paid us to come back! Extremely disappointed, and avoid this place and make the better decision to have true Italian food, because this place does not serve anything like Italy has. Founder must have been drinking too much wine to remember what Italian food should be like. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing food, service was superb, and ambience was perfect! We had a late night dinner on a Sunday night. Our server answered all of our questions, made the perfect recommendations and our meal was delicious! I would highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion or just a nice weeknight dinner. Well done Fat Ox!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one because the food is REALLY GOOD. Our server was amazing and he definitely knew his stuff and everything we ordered was delicious. I ordered the tableside Caesar salad, Burrata di Bufala, Garganelli, and Scottish Salmon. Everything was absolutely fabulous. My only complaint was pricing for the portion sizes. Portions were definitely on the small size and the pricing was definitely on the high side."}
{"text":"Great food, upscale environment, and a good place for groups. We came here for a birthday party and first hung out at the bar. The bar staff was super fast and friendly and while I didn't have any cocktails myself, everyone else that did loved their drinks.

They did a great job of accommodating our group of ~12 and the service didn't suffer as a result. The appetizers, wine selection, and main courses were all great. I ordered the Duroc Pork Tomahawk - very tender and full of flavor, not to mention a cool dish to look at. The beans that came with it were even better!

While not traditionally Italian, overall, if you're looking for a good, upscale restaurant and want to try something new, this is a good place. On the other hand, there's nothing terribly special about it that would make you want to come back again."}
{"text":"A party of five dining Thursday night.  The service had some lapses initially but finished out quite well, staff was always polite and professional but for the first 10 minutes or so some members of our party were getting ignored it seemed.  The food and wine made up for it.  Salty perhaps, as Italian food seems to be, but delicious.  Melt in your mouth steak, soft chewy mushrooms, salty truffle butter pasta, bread, too much.. my eyes were bigger than my stomach and liver and paid the price for that, but that tells you how good things are tasting when you nibble your way to wheelbarrow stuffed.

Also 4 out of 5 because where we were seated it was super super loud, near the bar and loud speakers.  I would request a better table in the future outside or anywhere else.  Also, it's super dark in there so you can't see what you're eating, and with good food I like to see the texture and oil and everything, reading bottles, etc. it was dark."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant that opened up about a year ago. Excellent fine dining Italian food with a mix of class. Beautiful interior and open large patio with a helpful friendly staff that is knowledgeable and attentive. They have an excellent happy hour from 4:30 to 6:30 and everything is on par. Definitely worth coming and checking out if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"One word- \"overrated\". I wanted to like them so badly as my fiancé has wanted to try this place for so long! Service was horrible, food mediocre at best, save your money and go elsewhere! Snotty Scottsdale at it's worst!"}
{"text":"Outstanding - culinary treat - small plate appetizers - and second courses - normal size entrees - great wine list - exceptional service - took a group of eight executives from around the country here for a diner they all loved it - so much that 4 of them went  back later that week"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We threw a birthday party there last night. Mark Drinkwater (owner) and his staff made sure everyone was taken care of. Everyone had a fantastic time. I can't say enough about how delicious the appetizers were that the staff passed around for us. If you are looking for a great venue to throw a party for someone, you won't be sorry in choosing this place."}
{"text":"Went there w/certain expectations (Matt Carter's impressive resume, an Italian restaurant, being in sctd, etc.). It is certainly good, well designed but very expensive & small portions for what you get. It's all about sctdl, the vibe, etc."}
{"text":"Came in to check out the Apertivo hour for a drink and a snack, but I was so impressed I ended up staying for dinner.  The pasta was the star of the meal, many unique dishes that can't be found anywhere else!! Loved the Rosso crest di Gallo and squid ink pappardelle, finished the meal off with the ribeye which was perfect to share with my date.  Flavor was amazing and left satisfied but not stuffed!!  Fantastic selection of wine and spirits and the cocktails were money.  We will definitely be back!!"}

Seriously, its about damn time...not kidding when I say EVERY course was really good. Truffle pasta...awesome! Scallops....sooo good. Steak??! Better than Mastro's in my opinion. Olive oil cake is a MUST. Great job guys!! You did it again!! (Its the same owners as ZINC, THE MISSION)"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and drink menu! Definitely do check out the veal meatballs and the prosciutto. The cocktails are fantastic and Connor at the bar is phenomenal"}
{"text":"Well I wanted to like this place but as others have mentioned, the service is simply poor. I was looking for somewhere to have dinner. It was 9:30pm. The restaurant was about half empty and I was denied a table. Granted it was restaurant week but I felt that they were profiling and did not want to seat my friend and I because we are young. I may come back and try the restaurant again though I was quite disappointed by the quality of service. I am perplexed as to how they were seating half the tables within the last hour of them being open for that night."}
{"text":"Incredible disappointment!!! Food came out chopped, service was laughable and i m sad to say that i will not go back !!!"}
