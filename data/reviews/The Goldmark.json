{"text":"Guys, listen... This place has good music, a great vibe, and $5.50 tecate and tequila. Don't question it, just fucking go. Tell em TJ or Q sent you. You're welcome"}
{"text":"The Goldmark was already my favorite place in Pittsburgh to get a drink and meet friends because of the great atmosphere, top DJs every night, and awesome staff. Now it's also one of my favorite places to eat. The food here is in another league above bar food. The pork buns, Goldmark Sandwich, Mac & Cheese, Cuban - everything on their menu is exceptional.

If you haven't been here yet, do yourself a favor and check it out. Take a good look around and you'll notice how much effort and detail went into this bar."}
{"text":"I met a few friends from college there over the weekend and I just loved everything about it. The drinks were good and so was the music!"}
{"text":"ipas + shots in package deal tiers. And all the early 2000s hip-hop your heart desires. Plus a way too small awkward dance space for those who can't help but bust moves. Amazing. And say bye, because you're blacking out and it's perfect. Ample amounts of trash cans to puke in, too.

Less hipster than the rest of Lawrenceville, and I'm more than fine with that because there are more than enough bros to pull you off the floor and babes to hold your hair back after your seventeenth shot of whiskey. Low key chill friend time also happens here if you don't feel like being too fun."}
{"text":"This brand new bar seems to be doing everything right in my book: reasonable prices EXPLICITLY STATED ON THE MENU (no mystery craft beer costs), a multitude of beer + shot specials, eclectic restroom decor, and overall very nice vibe, a.k.a. a perfect and much needed middleground between smoky dive and upscale/overpriced/pretentious. 

The original floor tiles and wooden, mirrored bar inherited from the building are perfectly shabby-chic and give the space a lot of character."}
{"text":"This is a great new place. The prices are good, and they often have real experienced DJs spinning real vinyl. My only complaint is that it gets too crowded!"}
{"text":"The bouncer is THE nicest person I have ever seen. He offered multiple people his jacket and said the worst part of bouncing was people having to stand in the cold. Towards the end of the night around 1:15 am a group of girls tried to bring pizza in - the bouncer let the girl store the pizza in his car so that the hungry vultures outside (aka us) wouldn't eat it. Props to you man - so nice to see a caring person."}
{"text":"They said Lawrenceville wouldn't become another Southside. They said everything would be great. THEY should go to Goldmark.  I don't have too much nice to say other than DJ Nuggett can throw down some sweet beats, but if I want to stand in line to get in...only to stand in line for a drink...then stand in another line for the bathroom amongst belligerent bros and hos (no offense to either since I've been known to bro-it-up and ho-it-up on occasion), I can go to Jimmy D's and be just fine. To be fair, Goldmark is FINE - but big picture, I don't really want it in my neighborhood. Not Goldmark's fault."}
{"text":"We came here after dinner while out celebrating our anniversary.  Since we were already in Lawrenceville for dinner it seemed an appropriate time to do a little bar hoping since I am noticing Larry-ville seems to be turning into the \"new\" Southside.  There was a lot going on here, and none of it was enticed me to stay past one quick drink.  

Before even walking in you could tell the place was booming.  Lots of 20 something's, loud music, and general hoochieness.  We went to the bar, and was approached by the bartender quickly if not overly friendly.  I asked for a drink menu, she hands me one and steps back.  I noticed the menu is so sticky it really disgusted me, but I soon came to find everything was sticky from the floors to the bar and most likely the other patrons.  I ordered a cocktail, the Gold Fashioned, a play on an Old Fashioned.  It was ok, would have been nice to have a little more bourbon and a little less simple syrup.  Speaking of syrup did some disgruntled worker mop the floor and bar with it.  Gross.  I had to use the restroom but decided to hold it until the next stop fearing what state that may be in.  Cashed out and split.  They get two stars one for being on the cheaper side of life, Craft beer and mixed drink $11 and change, and no wait with the service."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try The Goldmark, since it seemed like an innovative and fun addition to the Larenceville bar scene. With the fate of Belvedere's still undecided that only leaves Remedy and Spirit for dancing, and sometimes those places are just a little smoky for my taste. I was hoping for a nice in between balance with great dance music and an artsier clientele, but I don't think The Goldmark is quite there yet.

In terms of atmosphere I was reminded a lot of Industry on a bad night as soon as I walked in. There were lots of conservatively dressed yuppie types trying to impress someone and a huge amount of bros. If that's your jam it's cool, but I'd rather not spend my evening in a crowd full of super sloshed women and men who refuse to understand that no means no. It felt like it could be categorized as a classy south side establishment, but I think Lawrenceville needs something a bit better. The service was adequate; Not too fast but not fifteen minutes to get a beer opened either. 

The layout greatly contributes to the awkward vibe, since the back room has tons of unused space and is decidedly more open. The DJ is currently situated right smack in the middle of everything in a booth a few feet from the end of the bar. (Some people were trying to dance in the four foot square spot between him and the bar...why??) A narrow hallway immediately to the right creates an instant bottleneck. Putting the DJ booth in the rear of the space (and getting rid of that massive column in the middle of the back room if possible) would create a fun area for dancing and mingling and free up much-needed breathing room around the bar. 

I may try this place again in six months or so to see if anything has improved. It's cute and I had high hopes."}
{"text":"The owner and his fiance are dear friends of mine and when I found out they were opening this place in Lawrenceville, the city's shining neighborhood star as of late, I knew it would be a success!  I visited The Goldmark on it's opening night and am sure I'll be back again and again...  Heck, I even went back the very next night for more!  The owners have done a complete renovation and anyone who had the chance to check this spot out when it was a Cuban restaurant will probably not even recognize the place.  It's wonderfully decorated and softly lit to provide just enough ambience to kick off your evening, grab a delicious beverage, and enjoy good company. 

DJ Nugget has been providing sweet sounds for Pittsburgh's hottest clubs for years and now he finds himself on the decks in his very own bar.  Great music, great service, a pretty awesome drink list... what more could you want?  Food you say?  Stay tuned!  A late-night food menu is in the works and will hopefully be ready to go soon.  After leaving the bar late last night and not being able to find anywhere in Lawrenceville that serves food so late, I know The Goldmark will hit it out of the park for a second time when the kitchen is up and running.  

The Goldmark is a goldmine when it comes to Pittsburgh nightlife:  if you're down for a chill night with great drinks, great company, no drama and no beefcakes eyeing you up from down the bar, you've gotta check this place out ASAP!!"}
{"text":"Update: So apparently in the first month or so they were not charging tax on top of the drinks and now they are. So technically the prices of drinks went up. That's really nice, so 1 more star for not being a calculation error but for forgetting to charge tax when they first opened.

Still, drops two stars for service. I'll be back to see how it's going."}
{"text":"Any place that has the combination of Iron City (heavy) and Old Grandad as a beer/shot combo is A-OKAY with the yinzer in me. Needless to say, that's what I started with when I entered the Goldmark on a Saturday night. This is a really fun place to visit if you're with a group of friends looking to have some fun beer/shot combos and do a little dancing! If you're not into lines or crowds, I wouldn't recommend coming here on a Friday or Saturday night as it was pretty crowded. Definitely looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is incredible and they have the best DJs in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Good food in Lawrenceville isn't hard to find. There's a new amazing place, all the way down past the hubbub of central Lawrenceville that caught my attention; The GoldMark. 

For a \"bar\" that is trying to make a name for themselves in the food world, they sure have made their mark. (pun totally intended) 

My date and I stopped in on the very first day that the kitchen was open. We decided to order a few things and fight amongst ourselves for dinner. The order came to one Chicken & Waffles sandwich, one GoldMark Cuban, (I love the play on words) and the Mac & Cheese. Yowza. All the food! For $26, it was quite the steal. 

The Chicken & Waffles sandwich is made with a perfectly fluffy waffle; just a little sweet. The chicken thigh was fried and crisp, and the jalape√±o/honey drizzle goodness was just right to top. It wouldn't be Pittsburgh if they didn't put coleslaw on it. This was just the right addition to pull the whole sandwich together. 

I'd like to go on record and say that I've never had a Cuban. However, this was a great first experience!! They use local rolls, and press braised pork, honey ham, house made pickles, swiss cheese, and a lemon aioli between them for an amazing first-bite (and every bite thereafter) experience. I'm not a pickle fan; but I loved these! 

I can't forget the Mac & Cheese. They make their cheese sauce in house (no cutting corners here), and then top it with Fritos. FRITOS. Yes, you read that right. It was a little slice/pile of heaven. 

I can't speak to the bar; because we were just here for the noms tonight, but their Beer & Shot tiers seemed pretty popular at the bar. 

They have a DJ every night that they're  open, good old-school guys spinning on vinyl, hence the name The GoldMark. 

I'll totally be back to eat the other half of the menu and more! 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in Lawrenceville!  The owners are such amazing people. This is such an amazing addition to the community."}
{"text":"Goldmark is ok, small bar that is congested when busy. DJ played top 40 music. Drinks are affordable, but a little more than other comparable spots. More of a yuppie crowd than expected."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to dance in Pittsburgh, the DJ's that play here are always spot on with their music. I will say it does get packed in Goldmark so know that going in, that by the time midnight rolls around you will have a hard time navigating around, especially to the bar and to the bathroom, also if you're not in before midnight there will most likely be a line outside.

Aside from those warnings though, it seriously is a great place to dance, just try to get there earlier so you can get in without any lines."}
{"text":"One of if not the most authentic d j dance clubs in the city!  Don't come here to here top 50 pop hits, come here for innovative mixing, House, electronica, Trippy trance and just great beats!  Usually only up to $5 cover and alcohol prices reasonable.  It can get crowded so get their early if you're planning on an event there like a birthday or something."}
{"text":"If you're a hardly sober twenty-something interested in both dancing and shouting on a weekend, I know just the place for you. Neu Pittsburgh's hottest club is The Goldmark. Have your ID ready and take a deep breath of freshly-vaped Lawrenceville air before sliding in to a dark Pittsburgh hallway that doubles as a dance floor. Cheap beer-and-shot combos ensure you care much less about the painfully absent transitions between 45-second clips of every hit song from the past 40 years. Mistakes are common and songs frequently stop abruptly or cut off to expose the existential silence of what this crawlspace once was. Start planning your next post-Bumble date because with the lights off at The Goldmark, you can do anything. Except stand on the benches. You can't stand on the benches."}
{"text":"Cover charge for guys. I won't even go in. No bar is worth a cover for the privilege to sit and drink. Don't bother, there are better bars in L-ville that won't charge you a cover"}
{"text":"The Goldmark has a DJ that spins some far out tunes. Really fun. I like the vibe of the venue it just sucks that it's a little cramped because it's kind of narrow and always packed with people. Not much room for dancing. Still a blast!"}
{"text":"Sigh. I think this place has potential if you go on a weekday or for happy hour (edit: they don't open till 6, so even HH may not be an option), but Saturday night it's not a place for those of us in our 30s.

I don't know why this bar is attracting the young 20 somethings who would normally frequent the South Side, but unfortunately on Saturday nights, that is the crowd. If you are a single and ready to mingle lady or gent 21-29, def. check this place out. I can say the DJ was doing a great job getting everyone to shake their booty and the bros with their backwards hats were having a jolly time.

Goldmark has kept the wooden bar and original tile, but painted trendy murals on the walls and added some cocktail tables. Surprisingly, there is a lot more room than you'd expect looking at it from the outside. I like that they have a Beer + Shot menu - never seen that before in the 'burgh! I also appreciate that they don't overcrowd the venue by not allowing more peeps in when they reach a certain capacity. I don't appreciate that people were smoking in the back of the bar (inside) when smoking is not permitted.

Cool spot for the youngins - I'll stick to my old person bars :)"}
