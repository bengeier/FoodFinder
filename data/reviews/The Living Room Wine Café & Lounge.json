{"text":"Ambience on point. Location is prime. Friendly yet knowledgeable service. Some may think the food is pricey but the quality is definitely fair for the price, not to mention killer happy  hour specials."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great spot. Food: really good, wine selection:  great. Absolutely terrible service. Had to track down 4 different people during the course of the night. Never approached after we were seated, flagged someone down for drinks, flagged someone else to get our food order, 3rd to get a second drink, and finally a 4th person to get a check. Prices too high for such poor service"}
{"text":"We were excited to see this place open, but a little less impressed when we visited.  The wine list is not bad and would consider it acceptable for the neighborhood, but some of the selections a bit high priced.  The prices and the happy hour pours are very high and a quite short.  We started with a bruschetta that was very good.  My wife ordered the French dip that she was very happy with.  I ordered steak salad.  The steak was cooked perfectly to order, but lacked any appreciable seasoning (very bland) and the salad was considerably over dressed. A very generous serving of radish way overpowered the entire dish.  I didn't even get a hint of the fennel.  Service was quite attentive and acceptable for the end of the happy hour.  I just feel the overall quality for the price and experience is not worth it.  We will give it a few more tries and if there is improvement I will up date this review.  I really hope this place can make it because the neighborhood is in dire need of some non national chain restaurant quality."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but was disappointed. The workers seemed snooty. Blueberry lemon drop and superfood salad were good. The bruschetta was TERRIBLE!  I got the ribeye bruschetta and it was like boiled beef in bad gravy. I exchanged it for the mushroom bruschetta, which was very plain sautéed  mushrooms and onions.  I'll go again for the martini but wont waist my money on the food."}
{"text":"Sofas all dirty as fuck!!! Glasses were dirty as fuck too!!! Bullshit...lol and they might have stole 8 cents too..."}
{"text":"Amazing place - with great food for every meal! Check out the injectable donut holes - out of this world!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the service! I came in for the first time the other day and had Andrea as my server. She was very friendly and welcoming. I wasn't sure what I wanted to order so I tried the prime rib sliders per her recommendation and they were amazing!! 10/10 would come back again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great!  Good food and by far best customer service of all Living Room locations.....side note. DJ sucked! He could really learn the difference between a happy hour crowd and a drunk club at 2am!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight before catching a movie. We had the bang bang shrimp, a flatbread and the salmon. All three were fantastic, looking forward to coming back soon to try some of the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Haven't been there but they \"had too much going on\" to toss used wine corks in a bag for me to use in a craft at an elementary school fall party.  I have two other places saving for me over the weekend (I need LOTS of corks) and it was no problem for them.  I love wine but The Living Room won't be where I drink it.  You'll find me at My Wine Cellar or at Unwined.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great location but service was really struggling for a Friday night .  Had to go request table service and then still took 5 more minutes while watching staff wall by without even acknowledging an entire section.  Hoping it improves as could be a great little location."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience. Our server was Andrea and her recommendations were spot on. Best service ever."}
{"text":"Their meal ingredients are high quality, but the execution needs some work. My sandwich had so much mayo it was impossible to eat it with my hands.  The french fries were good but the potato chips lacked seasoning. My husband's burger tasted good but lacked anything to set it apart from any other burger I've had in Ahwatukee. There has been alot of positive buzz about this place. I was expecting more. Too bad the menu isn't as sexy as the ambiance."}
{"text":"Place was hopping but as we walked in a member if the waitstaff - Sydney - with glasses in stopped, grabbed menus and seated us. Service was, to say the least, exemplary. Food was good, wine too. But the service will be tough to beat!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time and what an awesome experience.  The food and drinks were great, but the service was amazing!  Andrea was very friendly and super personable.  I will definitely be back.  Thanks again!!!"}
{"text":"Just Opened.  Even though limited seating inside, outside patio is great even with 110 temps.  Fan misting system makes it cool.  Staff is kind and attentive.  Cant wait to go back this is going to be my new Regular place.  So happy they opened this location."}
{"text":"Pleasant servers. Empty glasses stacked 4 high weren't ever taken from the table. Chilaquiles tasted like canned chicken. The popular $4 sangria made me wish I was over at Pita Jungle having a better sangria. This place was surprisingly more disappointing than it's sister restaurant La Sala."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect from this restaurant, but I am glad I went.  The ambiance is great.  The interior is unique and the patio area is welcoming.  I had their black Angus burger with bacon and grilled onions and fries = excellent.  My boyfriend had there chicken Cobb salad, which he said was good.  Sunday night you can purchase bottles of wine for half off.  We had an Argentina Malbec that was great tasting.  The bottle is regularly $28 and we got it for $14.  2 glass of wine cost $16 so it was a great deal. We had between us 3 glasses of Malbec each.  Desserts are outrageous in price.  No restaurant dessert is worth the prices they were asking.  The had live a music performance and the artist was very good.  My only complaint was he was sooo loud that it was hard to here the conversation I was having with my boyfriend.  I gave the restaurant four stars due to the loud music and the outrageous price for desserts.  I will go back.  It was a great experience."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this location!! The crab and asparagus crepe was amazing!!! Very light and stuffed with crab and asparagus!! A little bit much asparagus for me. My drink was never empty. The wait staff was very attentive to my table!  I enjoyed the atmosphere. It took a little bit long to get my check and to go box.  I would recommend this place and I will go back again!"}
{"text":"It's a bar that serves overpriced, small portions of food. The space is small and it's really noisy. If you're young and into drinking or don't dine out much, this place will be fine. If you're older, looking for a pleasant atmosphere and appropriately priced food/portions, keep walking."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere is amazing. Having an acoustic set during brunch was very nice. Food was subpar at best."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the atmosphere of this adorable place. We arrived to late for a snack , but staff was so friendly and knowledgeable that I will most certainly be back with my friends next week! I can't wait to show this place off to my Chicago friends! Our bartender probably wanted to close up as it was nearly empty , but she never once gave us the impression we had to leave. Accommodating until we did leave! I'll be back soon for early happy hour - 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"I found this place quite by accident while attempting to avoid the average breakfast offerings while touring with my band. They were across the street from my hotel and while sandwiched between several other restaurants they were the only one open before 10:30. A small, but adequate menu for my brunch needs. Veggie friendly. The host and the waitress were very pleasant and attentive. If it had been a bit warmer I would have chosen to sit on the lovely patio with the heaters."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Food is very below average and your crammed into the dining area like a bunch of sardines. The Manager Who works during the happy hour and into the evening is rude and unprofessional. She has no business being in the service industry."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food and wine here, also great cocktails. Loved the take on a Moscow mule with cucumber! The awesome fries are truly awesome :)"}
{"text":"So we met up here for a few drinks and compressed socialization. It was 4pm on a Friday, and the inside was almost completely full so we opted to sit in in the heat outside, with the aggressive misty-fans cooling to some degree.   First off, Ahwatukee have needed a place like this. Seriously. And that it is located next to an AMC that has a full bar, make this place now a sweet date option in my book.  Second off, the Happy Hour was totally alright. I had a few beers and the Bavarian Pretzel. Now the pretzel itself was tasty but not that special - however, the mustard that accompanied the pretzel was stellar. Three different kinds, and spot of in heat and sweetness. Beer was beer, I should write a haiku about my relationship to this delicious brew. Stay away from anything raspberry no matter how hot it is outside.   The service overall was good, but our waitress was far from nice. She was showing the ropes to another girl whose name she kept mispronouncing. I felt it was a juvenile power play. But I think that was on a personal level and does not represent the whole establishment.   By 5pm this place was at capacity and a very pleasant place in general. Inside gets crowded, so getting around is tricky... but I like that, people shouldn't be moving around unless they have to. I will be coming back here this summer."}
{"text":"It had been 10 months since I had been here. It always seemed too busy or loud for our taste, but my husband and I were walking past and decided to try it. We were able to sit in the patio and had a very nice dinner and time.   I had the wedge salad and LOVED IT!  My husband had a Burger and said it was ok, not great but not bad either.   We have been back several times since then and have also discovered their injectable Donut holes... AMAZING!!  The service is ok as well. Not off the charts great though. They have Team Service and it seems to be spotty... One minute there several people helping us and then there seems to be a dry spell.   Overall we like The Living Room alot and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The music is always consistently way too loud. Can't have a conversations because you end up having to shout."}
{"text":"We stopped by the Living Room tonight (6:30pm) for a bite to eat. The restaurant looked it was a little more than 1/2 full. We were greeted as soon as we walked up and was seated at a table. Cold water was poured for us within one minute. Our first waitress took our drink order, a draft beer and a cocktail, dropped them off and asked if we were ready to order. My wife ordered a chicken salad. I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad. The waitress did not write down order.  (Sounds like a great experience ... NOT )  Well this is where things started to go bad. When I ordered I had the seared ahi tuna salad, I asked for the tuna rare, add onions and dressing in the side. Our food runner dropped off the salads and said she will be our new waitress. After she walked away I went to grab my fork but there was no silverware on the table. We had to wait for her to bring us forks. I went to put pepper on my salad ......... you guessed it, no salt or pepper.   My tuna was cold like it was stored in the refrigerator, not seared hot and served rare. I did get my dressing on the side but the greens were drenched in dressing. They did get the order right with added onions.  Oh.... let me tell you about the onions. When I got the bill I was charged $1.00 for added onions to my salad. Are you kidding me! When I paid my tab I told the waitress there was a mistake I was charged $1.00 for onions. She said she did not take our order but she would take it off the bill. I said \"you don't understand. I ordered the onions on my salad but you made a mistake by trying to charge me $1.00\". She looked confused but $1 was removed form my bill.   So why 2 stars and not 1? The seared ahi tuna salad was very tasty. We may give the Living Room another try. Maybe for happy hour. Remember .... there are numerous restaurants in Ahwatukee. Check your bill before you pay and don't settle for sub par service or food."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere on a Friday night, drinks were great, however the food portions were small. I would go back and have a burger instead of the flatbread."}
{"text":"Just tried this place Saturday. Ordered some champagne and was told that the bottle price was 39 dollars, which it said on the menu. It said there was a half bottle special, which I even asked \"is that half of the 39?\" to which our waiter said yes. When I get my bill I see that I've paid 72 dollars for a bottle of champagne! I tried to argue and he says \"oh no 39 is the half bottle price\" That's not at all what he told me. My friend was with me and heard everything.  Very misleading. Nice place but I feel jipped. Not sure I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow and incompetent wait service.  Sat at the bar while waiting for a table- never got called to a table.  Decided to stay and eat at the bar.   Waiter brought a second round of beer that wasn't asked for by 1 guest, and that's about all the attention we got for nearly 2 hours of sitting at the bar.  Placed food order for a club sandwich and a Bavarian pretzel....35 minutes later, it wasn't \"done\"."}
{"text":"Father's day free bloody Mary for dad.  Bottomless mimosas.  Eggs benedict with homemade hollandais. ..who could ask for more!"}
{"text":"Having a wonderful brunch at The Living Room in Ahwatukee. The bottomless mimosas are not to be missed. Unlike other restaurants, they actually have a decent ratio of champagne to juice. The eggs benedict are phenomenal. Personally my favorite is the breakfast sandwich on wheat. Shout out to Andrea and Cole, fantastic servers, never an empty glass or hungry belly. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and despite having some great wine I was real put off by the attitude of the staff.  I felt like we were inconveniencing our waitress who was also working behind the bar and there didn't seem to be a restaurant manager in sight on a Monday night.   The entire time we were there our waitress never cracked even the slightest smile or warmth when greeting us or serving us throughout the night.  It was actually a relatively cool night yet the had their patio fans blaring the entire time yet she said she could not turn them off.  The entire patio erupted in a cheer when FINALLY another waitress did turn them off so she obviously didn't care or had no idea how to read the guests.    All of the food was average and the bill was high because we polished off six bottles of nice wine.  The kicker was when the waitress added 20% on our check for her shit show service. Considering a $600 bill she made a hell of a lot more than she was worth and I certainly won't be back to share my money with her."}
{"text":"Been here a more than a few times and have always had a great experience. The first time I came in I asked for a \"good red\" and the bartender surprised me with what I found out is actually one of my personal favorites: Elouan Pinot Noir. Been back many times as I have gotten to know the staff and allow them to surprise me each time. Only had good a few times but the prime rib sliders are my go to at this point. Great addition to Ahwartukee."}
{"text":"We decided to go out for wine and picked this place because we've always had great service. Tonight however was terrible. The nice server poured the hot wax from the candle all over my leg, it went through my skirt in two spots and reached my leg. Ruining my skirt and evening.  When we were brought the check the server did ask if I was OK again and I told her I was but since my skirt was now covered in wax as well as my leg I didn't not want to pay full price for my experience. The took off $.389!!! And when the manager dropped off the check that's all she did. She didn't say shit. Unfortunately for my family this place is no longer a viable option when going out.  Not to mention our water was never refilled and we weren't told that there was a last call on the kitchen so when we went to order more it wasn't even an option. Which after this experience I'm glad I didn't give them any more money. Who knows maybe the poor service was due to me being black or us being gay but either way. We're done."}
{"text":"It's ok. The fries are tasty... I added Brie. The shrimp appetizer is popcorn shrimp with aioli sauce (eh). And the bruschetta is pretty good (though for me, the bruschetta at Postino establishments is better). Service was pretty poor (my table had to flag down the host after about 20 min of being seated to order drinks since our waitress was MIA, lengthy delays between ordering and getting drinks,and then our waitress got our order wrong for our bruschetta plate). Overall, I won't go out of my way to go back but it's an ok spot."}
{"text":"Good, local wine bar... they have a pretty good patio, weather permitting... wait staff is attentive, food is good (their salads especially), and the value is there. The only thing that one might complain about is the wine selection... hasn't been that extensive... but what they do have it pretty nice."}
{"text":"My son and I love the living room. We come here a lot for the weekend brunch. Our favorites are the injectible donut holes or the steak and eggs but when I've brought friends here, all the items are great. The service is friendly and fast. Sydney in particular is excellent - she remembers our order and does an exceptional job of checking in on us - not too much but just enough to make sure we have everything we need.  For dinner it's great too right before or after a movie at the AMC Ahwatukee theatres. Good wine selection and we like the prime rib sliders and the steak frites!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Go there to escape the outside world. Good, service, and prices are perfect!"}
{"text":"The best bartender waitress we've seen in a long time Alicia at the living room in Chandler she's amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome good and perfect service(thanks Jamie!) Highly suggest the chiliquelas, the veggie crepe and Benedict as well as the bottomless mimosas    Fast and talented kitchen staff, nice atmosphere, and they have football on; Wonderful Sunday outing."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem! Great Decor with high back chairs. Excellent service, the food is 5 Star. Went there for lunch the first time and the food was delicious. I had Ahi Tuna Salad hubby had Prime Rib Sliders. Excellent! Extensive wine and beer menu with specialty drinks. Went back for brunch the menu was diverse again high end and delicious with bottomless mimosas served in generous wine glasses! Ratio 80% sparkling wine 20% OJ. They also had a guitar player/singer. Nice. They have a DJ for dinner, couches and lots of patio seating. Going back 8/3 for dinner on hubby's birthday. Aptly named the atmosphere makes you never want to leave. A great place to just hang out too!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have happy hour at this place. Cool place with chic styling!  We were there for happy hour.  But, was so disappointed.  The service was bad.  The waitress did not come to check on us and we only ordered the meat and cheese board (which requires no cooking) and it took a long time for it to come out.  The meat and cheese board was disappointing because it had a small piece of cheese and only few slices of meat.  This appetizer was not for sharing, it was probably built for one person.  They went more generous on the nuts and the bread.    I don't think I got my money's worth for it.  But, the meat and cheese were of good quality and tasted good!  I think it would be better if the waitress would check on us at least a few times and if there were a few more quality pieces on the meat and cheese board."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place for the first time I bought a Groupon certificate and we went here for breakfast. I ordered the fruit Crepes those were very good and my husband ordered the Eggs Benedict that was really good to. Not sure for $13.95 good but I had my Groupon. The server took our order brought us our drinks and didn't come back until we were done. and at that time asked how are food was. No salt and pepper on the table, needed for our hash browns and my husband needed a refill on his coffee, he had to flag someone else down. Not impressed with the service, even if you have a Groupon you should still have the great service, not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Love the seating. Love the patio.  The food is great.  I highly suggest the steak.  JP came out personally to make sure my steak was perfect.  Andrea was my server.  She is awesome and full of smiles.  Chris the manager introduced himself as well.  Just nice customer services."}
{"text":"I really don't like to leave negative reviews. If you want to sit outside, this is a great place.  However; when the temps exceed 110 don't expect ample seating inside or be \"welcomed\" into the café to wait for an inside table.  Head to My Wine Cellar instead.  There is ample inside and outside seating and much friendlier staff."}
{"text":"Checked out this place last night, it was really cute I'd say perfect for a girls date to chat and gossip. The patio is equipped with torches and a fire pit for cold nights. I liked the Red sangria it was delicious. The only thing that took a star away was the fact that someone was smoking a joint outside and that's all I could smell at my table. Other than that service was excellent! Will visit again!"}
{"text":"A little pricey. Ordered the red sangria but it was a little watery. Also ordered olives as an app. They were also okay. Had the Margarita flat bread. It has nice presentation but bland taste. Overall an okay experience."}
{"text":"I really wasn't sure what to expect of this location bc it just seemed too small of a spot. Had lunch there today. It was just darling and exactly what Ahwatukee needed. I had a simple strawberry walnut salad and added some ahi tuna.  It was delicious and I nearly licked the plate. We sat inside. But outside the misters were on and the couches and tables will be perfect for cooler evenings. Go. Go. Go."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I celebrated here for may graduation.  Happy hour prices are very impressive! We spent three hours having a lovely time out in the patio. Food was good too.  Mostly I enjoyed the ambiance. If there is only one thing I would change about this place is that the patio furniture outside could really use a wash or replacement."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the laid back atmosphere at The Living Room.  The patio is very warm and inviting.  They've got a great variety of menu items whether you're in the mood for sushi, a flatbread pizza, or a burger.  The service was friendly, but a bit on the slow side.  There were other tables seated after us who were served drinks before we were even able to order ours - by the same server.    The portion sizes are also on the small side, so I'd recommend going if you're looking to share a couple of appetizers or a quick snack."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with office didn't have a variety of food especially if you're vegan. I got an avocado cucumber sushi roll because it was either that or a salad which I'm not a big salad eater. Roll was ok but not filling. Would have much rather ordered one from RA right next door if I wanted sushi. Food took forever, probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time at this quaint wine bar over the weekend!!  We were early getting to the AMC theater so we decided to stop in to The Living Room for a drink.  Their $5 Patron Margarita was the Best!!  Food was very good and service was  top notch!!!  Very comfortable place to kick back and relax !!  We will be back !!"}
{"text":"Honestly worst service I have received in a long time. They were so slow at everything. More than 15 minutes for them to take my order and more than 20 to give me my change. Honestly they weren't even busy.Not recommending or coming here again."}
{"text":"Great food, went for happy hour!!! Good prices, we had the awesome fries and California rolls and a few beers, what a deal! This place is a great addition to AWatukee !!"}
{"text":"Firstly let me say the decor is DIVINE!!!  Beautiful atmosphere and very friendly staff..  The only reason why I'm giving it three stars is because the appetizers weren't that great and I thought it was a little pricey.  But, I haven't had a \"real\" meal there; just the appetizers."}
{"text":"We had an amazing lunch today.  The bartender was awesome as well.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Such a great place for brunch!! I mean bottomless mimosas!!! Love it. The food was awesome, the service excellent and the decor was gorgeous!! Grab some brunch and then go see a movie, such a great weekend destination."}
{"text":"It's orange and trying to be a night club. No ice in the water. Had a salad which was good. When I didn't order alcohol, the waitress looked at me like I was in the wrong place. It's kinda hard to understand where to go when you first come in, maybe we are all just looking for a sign. Overall, meh. By the outside, looks like it's taking business away from ra next door. Will most likely give this place another shot. Come here for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice place for a glass of wine and some quiet chat. Always love hanging out in this part of I would Tukey and the living room makes it a fun time. Good service and nice ambience."}
{"text":"Nice spot for brunch!  $4 sangrias and unlimited mimosas for only $14. The food is quite delicious. Be sure to try the French toast. The perfect consistency and flavor!  The atmosphere is perfect for a cool morning with a nice fire in the middle of the table."}
{"text":"The living room offers a great selection of food.  I would definitely recommend the French Dip with sweet potato fries and flat breads.  The brunches are definitely worth checking out.  The seating outside definitely has an upscale atmosphere to it.    I would dock it one point as every time I go there in the summer months, it's too hot to sit outside and the seating options are limited inside.  I have only gone there on a Friday and Saturday night and was lucky to get a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for a new \"nice\" place to eat for date night.  While the decor is lovely and the service was very good, the food was overpriced and not delicious.  Hubby enjoyed his burger but the bun was visibly soggy and the french fries were overcooked.  My tuna melt was a  soggy, drippy mess and the potato chips were greasy and disgusting.  I make a better tuna melt at home.  I think this place wants to be upscale, and I was irritated by roughly half of the patrons dressed in shorts and t-shirts.   How I wish someone would open a date night restaurant in Ahwatukee!!!  I will not be dining at The Living Room again."}
{"text":"Great food, service and bottomless mimosas for $5! Can't beat that! Upscale casual experience that sends you to tastebud Utopia!"}
{"text":"We won't be back to the ahwatukee location. Came here two different times. The first I went on a Saturday night with my husband (date night) and no one acknowledged us when we walked in nor did we even get a happy greeting when we were finally sat at a table. About 10-15 min passed before we were even offered some water and then they disappeared. And I say they because out of the 3 people that we spoke to, no one said they were our server. So we just got up and left. Not that anyone cared anyway. I then gave it another shot, this time during lunch a week later with my sisters on a Sunday. Just as bad service. Our waitress was full of attitude/annoyance. We asked about the an item on the menu and she followed it up with a \"soooooo are you ready to order\" no eye contact or even a crack of smile. We had sangria and the spinach/artichoke dip and man I felt like I was at chipotle paying $3 for an ounce of Guac. Def not worth $15!  So the overpriced appetizers and negligent service is what did it for me. The only reason I give them 2 stars is because the sangrias were tasty."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed. Cocktails were good, bruschetta was excellent. Chicken sandwich's and the ahi salad were not very good. We had to ask for a water bowl for our dogs (which was reluctantly provided). Service was not very friendly; gave the impression that were not welcome. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We absolutely love going to this place! We have had Andrea as our server a few times now, and she has been amazing! Great service, great food, and an awesome atmosphere. Having a few drinks on a Sunday afternoon and they have live acoustic music which was fabulous. We have also had great service with Preston and Chris.  Everyone is so nice and helpful. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite before seeing a movie, this place is so cute. Wine selection on point, food was delicious, staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great service, great staff!!! The food was delicious and the DJ rocked. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hot new spot by the movie theater. This is where you go when there are no good movies to see!! They have a great wine list and delicious menu.   We had a large group that they accommodated quite nicely.   Several of us ordered food, plenty of wine and sangria's. No one seemed disappointed. I ordered the Aji Tuna Salad which was above average. I would like a little more flavor to the dressing and a few more slices of Aji but overall it was fresh and tasty which is most important.   It's loud inside but the patio is a great option when weather permits. Even in the high temps they do their best to cool it down with fans, misters and a super cool blower.   It's beautiful inside and out and had phenomenal service by Rachel! Good job Living Room and welcome to Tukee!"}
{"text":"I would like to say that I really like the concept, location, and setup of the restaurant. The only downside is the lackadaisical attitude of the staff. The management needs to train their staff in general hospitality and service.   We went on a weekday evening and wanted to grab a bite to eat before we saw a movie at the AMC theater. When we arrived we were promptly seated and the restaurant was about 1/4 full. We placed our food order along with a flight of pinot noir. We had asked that the pinot flight come with the food. So far the service had been good. When the food got delivered it started to go downhill.   We ordered a flatbread and a burger. Once the food was delivered we waited for the wine. I flagged the server down and asked for mustard for my burger and reminded her of the wine order. We got done with about half of our food when I got up and once again asked for the wine. This was annoying since the restaurant was not busy and had plenty of wait staff sitting around. A different server brought us our wine flight and excused the tardiness because they had just gotten a lot of drink orders for a large party that had just arrived. This seemed an absurd excuse since we had ordered our drinks about 20 minutes before that party arrived. After the wine arrived we were left unattended for a long while to the point that I had to ask for the check three times to two different people. Finally, I had to go to the bar to pay my bill.   In conclusion, the service was appalling, the food was mediocre, and the wine list is all of young vintages. My wife and I  will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST brunch in town! Bottomless mimosas. Nutella banana crepes. Live music. Amazing decor (seriously it looks like a Pinterest board in here). Their evening menu is pretty solid too! The twirley girl is auuuh-mazing. The charcuterie board is delicious. Overall it's a pretty solid date day/night choice."}
{"text":"The patty melt is my favorite! The staff is always attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing. Perfect spot for dinner and drinks before a movie"}
{"text":"I have visited the other location many of times and didn't realize that the Living Room had opened a new location here in Ahwatukee. Anyways, as always, great service from all the staff as expected from this establishment, food was great, my server was very knowledgeable of the menu and drinks available, Andrea also did a great job of suggesting different drinks to go with each individual plate that we had ordered. I will be back for sure and ask that for Andrea's section if she is on shift for that day. And I also like that this location is so much closer to my house."}
{"text":"Super cute place to have some wine and good food with the girls or for a date night. The staff was super friendly and our server took great care of us. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Love this location! Great food and fun and friendly wait staff! The perfect spot to come and relax with friends or grab drinks and dinner before a movie. I love the big board (meat and cheese plate) or the living room club and the royal smash drink is delicious. Perfect addition to ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Can be a little loud at times.  A friendly staff.  Nice food and wine selection.  Live entertainment is always a plus.  Recommend for all."}
{"text":"Summary: good happy hour, crowded, have some kinks to work out, good addition to AMC 24 area.   Went here for happy hour the other day. We showed up very early, but the place was packed. By the time we left, there was a very long wait for tables and almost all of the outdoor seating was filled, despite being ~115 degrees.   We waited at the bar (super cramped) for about 10 minutes and a table opened up. We were in the middle of happy hour, so we all ordered drinks. Unfortunately, it didn't seem like they had any non-wine happy hour drink specials. They do have sangria on happy hour though, which was pretty good. It wouldn't hurt to have a couple beer/cocktail specials added to the happy hour options.   Food:  We ordered 4 bruchettas- 2 traditional and 2 greek. Server only brings out 2 (1 of each). Whatever, we move on. What is shocking is that the tiny bruschettas are only cut into threes. Two very small bruschettas divided into 6 very, very small slices comes out to $9......uhhhh what? D  Bavarian pretzel: this was a solid happy hour deal. Good, warm pretzel, with three different types of dips (I think they might have been three different types of mustard). I don't even like pretzels that much, but this one was good. B+  Slider and a beer: this was probably the best deal on happy hour. Got a great beer and a really good prime rib slider (good sized) for $5. A  Service:  Service was a little spotty and it's clear that they still have some kinks to work out. No big deal, it's still new, but I might give it some time to work out before I go back. Service wasn't great, but the place was slammed. Server missed an order, that happens. What I really thought was absurd and, quite frankly, unacceptable, was how they were opening up the inside area to the extreme outside temperatures.   We were sitting right by the front door and they decide that it's a great idea to prop the front door open. It's 115 degrees outside. I showed up early so I didn't have to endure a slow painful death outside in the heat. Despite constant complaints, they would not close the door. On the far side of the restaurant, they had a garage door style roll up window/door opened as well. Not sure if this was to let the air conditioning outside so the people sitting out there don't have a heat stroke, but it was really uncomfortable inside with all the hot air blasting in. This is just plain stupid on many levels.   Seating in this place is already very limited. Very, very limited for how many people were here. By opening up areas to the extreme heat, it takes several more tables out of play as those are basically as bad as outside seating now. More annoyingly is that we said something and they just kind of shrugged it off. Might as well have told us to go pound sand.   Overall, it has the foundation of something good, but has a ways to go until it's a go-to spot. I will go back in a couple months to see if they have tightened up the service. I'm sure it will be really nice when the weather cools off, but can't wholeheartedly recommend this place in the summer time if they insist on turning the interior of this place into a sauna."}
{"text":"Love the half bottle Sundays, they have a great wine selection at such amazing prices on Sunday night. The food is always good, I get the Patty melt everytime. They do team service which takes getting used to, but I like that all the servers are ready to help you and service is always fast."}
{"text":"We came to this place because it looked really nice and we had a coupon. It wasn't worth it. My drink was made from store bought mix, my food was sub par and the service was acceptable at best. Also noticed the kitchen staff doesn't wear gloves. The menu was over priced for what you got. I wouldn't suggest eating here."}
{"text":"Friday nights are always busy for happy hour, so we got there at 445 (happy hour ends at 6). The host said 30 minutes for a party of 7. ONE HOUR AND TWENTY minutes later we get a table... No happy hour prices for us.  Great food, too loud atmosphere & waitress had way too many tables to be attentive.  Great location too but 3 stars for incorrect wait times, no applogy & missing happy hour (the whole reason we chose this location)."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  We for happy hour on Friday, and this place was packed! The outdoor portion is huge, and is very accommodating for large groups. For the summer time, they have misters, and for the winter time they have table top firepits.   The happy hour menu has a huge variety and the prices were great. All of the skinny cocktails were $5, appetizers were priced from $2-7, and $3 beers.  I'm a big lemon person, so the Blueberry Lemon Drop was right up my alley! The rim was coated in sugar, and the drink was absolutely refreshing. The Thin Mint Mojito was just as refreshing. I ordered Edamame and Awesome Fries, as well. The edamame had a garlic pepper seasoning that I initially questioned but the black pepper was really tasty! The fries were extremely hot and crunchy, and the seasoning was delicious and the garlic aioli was such a great dipping sauce.   My sweet tooth was out of control when I ordered the Warm Pizza Cookie. The cookie was crunchy on top, and the inside was perfectly gooey. I'm still dreaming about this dessert!  The managers and staff were very friendly and provided great service. I definitely cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"The food selection is limited but there are a few items that are decent. This last time we went not realizing the closing time was 10pm. We arrived at 9:35pm and the manager went out of her way to speak over the waiter to tell us the kitchen already had it's \"last call\". She was very unperfessional and rude. Long story short, we will not be going back to that mediocor qusine and terrible service."}
{"text":"Lovely place. Great service. Excellent wine. Why the hell do we need a tv? I don't think your clients are here to watch football  Also you have a lovely young lady singing w tv over her head. Why?  This is intended as constructive criticism  Would have given you five stars :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving it three stars purely because the ambiance was pretty cool. Live music was great and the chairs were comfy. The food on the other hand was terrible. Wife had the cob salad which tasted bland and needed salt and better dressing. I had the prime rib sliders, which honestly tasted below mediocre. I've had better from the frozen isle at Costco. The prime rib was minced with the cheese mixed into the meat... Not what I expected for $17. Service was meh. Not overly friendly, but not dismissive either. I've never been a fan places where the servers and managers dress in the same clothes they go clubbing in... If you catch my drift."}
{"text":"Service great-  especially for a new restaurant. Husband ordered a margarita and prime rib sliders.  I had a Chardonnay (that our server recommended) and the chicken sandwich.  Wine was great, sand which was ok (the chicken and fillings were great, but the bun was twice the size of the chicken) and the house made chips weren't as crispy as I like.  Husband's meal & drink were on point.  Definitely worth ordering the sliders-  horseradish was creamy & spicy, lots of steak, and the French fries were crispy & flavorful.  The atmosphere is very trendy & inviting."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for some drinks last weekend. They have great sangria and the patio has a nice misting system! Service was awesome, especially for how busy it was. We'll def be back!"}
{"text":"I have been at the Living Room multiple times now and every time I am reminding how bad the food is here. There is nothing in the menu that is fresh and tases good. The only reason to come here is the ambiance! Very disappointed that the look and quality doesn't match!"}
{"text":"Love the patio and people watching at this location. They have half bottle Sundays and a nice happy hour. The only problem is the service is very hit or miss. Some nights you may have everyone asking how you are and other nights hard to get served. Biggest complaint is on half bottle wine day they don't offer a wine list or pricing menu. When we asked for the wine list we were told 'just imagine the cost of 2 glasses of wine and that's the cost of a bottle!' We had to repeatedly ask for the wine list which seems odd."}
{"text":"The wine was awful and the sangria tasted like sprite with a splash of wine. We also ordered the fondue and it came out in a pot with a candle under it, you know to keep the cheese warm! The waitress said oh we don't light the candle it's just for looks but don't worry the cheese shouldn't harden if you eat it quick enough ?!?"}
{"text":"Great service and the Happy Hour drink specials during the day are excellent too!  Try the French Dip sandwich. It's pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"Best place every!!!! Chris is the best waiter ever! Bottomless mimosas are everything! And did I mention the French Toast?!?!? If you go to the living room you have to get the French Toast! Amazing place is an understatement! Best place in the chandler area!"}
{"text":"Big shout out to Alicia...my favorite bartender! Consistently amazing service! Food and drinks are always delicious!"}
{"text":"There's no hiding it, on top of my good looks, I have those moments when I can be a jerk, especially when it concerns to restaurant's: spoil me. I came for a quick drink, Coca-Cola please, waiting on the movie to start. I've never been so spoiled. Seriously, the waiters/waitresses have spoiled me. Now if I get this type of service for a soft drink order, I can only imagine the quality of service I'll receive when I return for a meal. Thank you."}
{"text":"I just want people to know you can add bacon, avocado, potatoes and what not to any item! The food is very yummy and light and the bottomless mimosas are the great! This was so much fun the manager was great and treated us so well. I love it here with the patio. My friends and I will be back!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars but I am rounding you up. Nice happy hour but red wine should not be that cold. I will bring a thermometer next time, just to be sure. Staff was great. Even recommended splitting a glass when we weren't sure we should have one more. Food was good, fries excellent. My friends French Dip was steaming when it came out. I hope you don't use a microwave."}
{"text":"Because I can't give a half star rating, the Living Room in Awhatukee will benefit from me rounding up as this is honestly a solid 2.5star place.   Last night was out 4th time in and honestly I am less exhausted red to go here each time we have attempted after our first. I'm not saying we will purposely avoid it from here out, but I certainly won't seek it out as an option-if I happen to be right there and nothing else seems palatable...well then. 3 of the 4 times we have been, I have had various red wine selections. The happy hour pricing is *from $5-although I never seem to be interested in the very limited $5 choices. Most of the good choices are around $8/glass on happy hour-considerably more expensive than Perfect Pear which is only a mile away. Additionally, my RED wine has EACH time been served REFRIGERATED. I don't personally prefer this, and it's not the standard way of serving it. That means I don't care to have red wine anymore in this particular location. Draft beer selection is not bad, not exciting either. Happy hour food choices are OK. As others note, prime slider and draft beer seems to be the best and most valuable choice. The edamame choice is tiny but it's also $2. So whatever. The worst parts of each experience besides the chilled red wine service are the service and the seating. The service has been extremely inconsistent with our first visit being the best. Last night, we were honestly within 30 seconds of walking out due to being ignored (not terribly busy-sat at the bar and were the ONLY PEOPLE at the bar with maybe 7 tables besides), when we were finally helped. Annoying. Makes me feel like they don't want to take my $ and makes me feel like they don't value me as a customer. Secondly, the seating is SO tight that, even being relatively thin, it is constantly difficult to even navigate to the bathroom or exit when it starts to fill up in there.  My boyfriend was forced to stand up and push his seat in just to let people trying to make it to the bathroom via what should be a walkway near the bar. And he is 6'5\" and 180 lb soaking wet. Removing even 3 tables would remedy that and allow customers breathing and moving room. After all, it doesn't Seem that the degree of service they provide can handle larger volumes of customers anyway so what's the harm?"}
{"text":"This place has a really cool vibe, drinks on the patio with good music, it felt like I was somewhere more exciting than the suburbs but so close to home! Win Win."}
{"text":"It's a little small and very tight inside if the doors to the patio aren't open.  That means in the dead of summer it's difficult to get seated.  The happy hour is good with the beer and slider for $5 being the best deal (IMO).  They have numerous glasses of wine and mixed drink options from $5 as well as plenty of food options.  The aforementioned prime rib slider was excellent.  The beer list is very light with only 6 options on draft.  Those 6 aren't very exciting either.  It looks like a good spot for brunch or a bite before a movie.  If you're with a group and can arrange one of the large lounge tables this is a good spot but I'll stick to Mellow across the street for my routine happy hour fix."}
{"text":"I can't visit a new city without getting a taste of what the brunch culture is like.  I was tasked with choosing the place for brunch, and I stumbled upon this one! The pictures I saw made it look rather classy from the outside, and in person it is indeed classy looking.  We didn't make a reservation, but we were seated as soon as we got there.  We got the choice of sitting either outside or inside, and obviously went with the outdoor option.  The table we were at had a fire going in the middle!  It wasn't cold outside, so at first I was concerned, but thankfully it wasn't giving off enough heat to disrupt the experience.    Some in our party got bottomless mimosas, and someone else got their sangria.  The food is not bottomless, so I decided to go with the fitness wrap, which is a turkey wrap with lots of good stuff in it!  It came with some berries (blackberries, blueberries and strawberries to be specific) and I found it to be quite refreshing.  Between the nice breeze, the music, the fire, and the good eats and drinks I would indeed see myself returning.    Note: I read an article from last year that said the bottomless mimosas were $10... the website menu said they were $12, but in actuality the bottomless mimosas are $14.  Be mindful of that."}
{"text":"Stopped for happy hour last Saturday. Wonderful service, great food and wine! With happy hour pricing from 11:00 - 6:00 pm. We will be back. The fries with melted brie are worth the cardio you'll do working them off!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, comfortable seating, great music and amazing service by Jamie! Definitely will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Pretty quaint little place. Modern music, modern decor with the exception of the chandeliers hanging from the ceiling which is a nice touch. Incredible happy hour with $3 draft beers and each day features a special of the day (here on Thursday is happy hour all day!! Can you say thirsty Thursday's!) Quick friendly service. Just drinking this time however they have an eclectic menu that I will be back to try at a later time."}
{"text":"I've been there a handful of times since they opened and have really enjoyed my time there. Music is good, atmosphere is good but had a bad experience with a male bartender  ( which I never like to see). He accused me of walking out on my bill the previous night, which I wasn't even there? Very strange. He never offered to make it right, which led me to get up and leave immediately and have not returned since. Big fan of Ocotillo Living Room but this one will do well but probably without me.  Advice : Ace the male bartenders"}
{"text":"We went there and we were seated quick but after that it went down hill we order coffee and water, we were given small thing of milk for the coffee, then we waited for a while to order the food, then another waitress walked up and said have you ordered food and and we gave her our order and then left while our drinks are empty. Then we were waited for a long while to order more drinks coffee and water but no one was even around they were walking by us and some others out on the patio including us. We grab the gentleman that brought us our food and I asked him if he can get us more coffee's and waters and we waited another long while for that and then he came back and dropped it off to us by that time three waitresses just walked by back-and-forth and nothing, we felt ignored even after my girlfriend mentioned that to a waitress. We stopped one waitresses to get creamer and it took forever to even get that so I had to go up and ask myself at least twice. The food was amazing I will give it that, the service needed improvement if your on the patio if you don't know anyone it seemed."}
{"text":"They have good food and friendly service. Responsibly priced bottomless mimosas on Saturday and Sunday for brunch. It's very cute place with good music and a lively atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We settled ourselves in on the patio to enjoy some wine after the movies and were having a really nice time. It was a relaxing Saturday for us and we took an Uber so we decided to indulge in a couple bottles of Pinot Grigio. Plus it's a lounge right? We wanted to take our time and enjoy the beautiful fall evening. The waitress was friendly, attentive and not overbearing. She even brought us a few different wines to sample.    The problem came (2 bottles of wine later) when the manager came up to us and said \"We have a large group coming in and are going to have to move you guys.\" No apology, no sorry for the inconvenience. Just a \"you are going to have to move\".  I jokingly responded \"Oh, do we get some dessert on the house?\". She just turned around and walked away. About 5 minutes later, instead of moving us, the manager literally jammed us further into the corner and pushed the space heater up against our table. This made not only us uncomfortable, but also the large party.   Holy CRAP lady, TAKE A JOKE. Soon after she started to talk to the waitress while she pointed to us and said something. Absolutely zero customer service skills on her part and not a way to treat your customers.   We were hoping to make this our Saturday night spot since it's not too far from the house and the wine was nice and properly chilled. Either way they definitely have lost our business because they can't treat their customers properly and apparently can't handle a joke about throwing us some free donut holes.  (By the way, the sushi we had was mostly rice and it all tasted the same. Lame.)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.. very cute decor and awesome staff.. I had the K.I.G. Sushi roll ahhhhmazing def my fave!! Would def recommend this place- its a great place for a date.. I plan on returning with hubby!!"}
{"text":"Loved Cole, the bartender, charming and quick service. Great food and great music. The prime rib sliders are the best! Great sushi too. Ahwatukee gem."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. The french toast was good but over priced. The mixed berry crepe was good but the crepe was really tough. The eggs benedict is also just ok, the ham on it is different its like shredded deli ham instead of a nice slice of Canadian bacon. The poached eggs were prefect on it though but thats about it for positives.  I will say the maple cream was the best thing out of all the food and it's just a topping. I would not come back in the future. Nothing stood out to return for. The service wasn't great either, they forgot the topping for the french toast,  ask for refill on drinks and i used a groupon the lady redeemed it then forgot to take ot off the bill. When asked about the groupon being taken off she said oh no i didnt can i see it to redeem it, i was like i already showed it to you and you hit redeem. She then said oh sorry i forgot, i see so many. It was not that busy."}
{"text":"I cannot say how horrible of an experience we had at this establishment tonight.  We, party of four, understood that on a Friday night, that The Living Room would be busy.  We also understood that this establishment is newly opened and perhaps all the bugs were not worked out.   We called early in the day and spoke to Ashlynn, who told us that although no reservations could be made, that she would put our name down for 6:15 and we would be given a table upon availability at the next opening.  When we got there, the obviously over stressed \"manager\", Chris was very rude when he told us he didn't have our name on the list.  That's ok, mistakes happen.  But then he put his hand on me in a very demeaning way, almost pushing me away. I am a woman of a certain age, perhaps not his preferred \"type\" of customer.  I was very insulted and told him not to touch me.  Remember me, Chris?  The SECOND manager I spoke to, I'm sorry I don't remember his name, was so much more diplomatic and kind.  I'd go back, the place looks lovely and the food that I saw served looked good but SOMEONE has to deal with that....... Chris."}
{"text":"I love this little spot. Great to place to bring girlfriends to happy hour.  Decor/ atmosphere is awesome and the food and drinks have been consistently good every time I've gone.  Service has been great with a staff who knows their wines and craft cocktails. Also, one of the better places for oyster shooters. Place was busy but not over packed or noisy on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Chop bruschetta is amazing... Prime rib sliders are delish and Parmesan fries with Brie are yum!  Servers are bartenders are equally amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the living room last night for happy hour with a few friends to check it out. Before we went I wanted to look at the menu to see what bottled beers were available and I couldn't get the Ahwatukee menu to come up so I looked at the other locations such as Chandler and Scottsdale to see what they had and figured they would be uniform. This was not the case I have severe food allergies and am ok with only a handful of beers i.e. Heineken, Dos Equis, (Pacifico & Japanese beers) that were at the other locations but not the Ahwatukee location, so I could not par take in any of the drinks. The selection was very poor as far as bottled beers and what was on tap. We ordered pork sliders which came out very wet which made the small rolls very soggy before even dipping in the au jus. Suggestion, use a crispy or harder roll which would be more appetizing if the meat is gonna already make it so soggy to start with. On the happy hour menu they offered a slider and beer but it does not say what kind of slider figured it was beef and was surprised it was pork. I agree with a few of the other reviews regarding melting outside and tables being packed and over priced menu not matching quantities of food you get for the money. Will stick with RA Sushi as our go to for happy hours & before movies, they have a friendlier atmosphere, great prices, awesome food that matches the price & wonderful welcoming staff!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with a trendy place to sit and relax with friends.  Great service and nice music.  Good prices with a nice wine selection."}
{"text":"If you're coming here for a bottomless \"mimosa\" brunch, I would go elsewhere.  Their mimosas are all orange juice leaving you with an upset stomach over feeling good.  If you want any other juice with your mimosa, you are charged full price (which means they clearly pre-mix their mimosas with LITTLE champagne so they don't loose any money).  I asked for a little extra champagne in my mimosa and the woman brought me a glass without informing me that I would be charged an extra $9.00.  When speaking to the manager, he informed me that no one else has ever complained and reinstated that the waitress poured me a full glass of champagne (without my knowledge of the price).  They ended up taking off the extra charge.  The problem I have with restaurants that promote \"bottomless mimosas\" is the bottomless orange juice they are selling you to save a buck on \"champagne.\"  I will NOT be going back to this restaurant.  If you want a good bottomless mimosa, I recommend driving to PHOENIX OR SCOTTSDALE.  You might get charged $15 over $12 but for the extra $3 you won't leave with a stomach ache."}
{"text":"Service  (10 stars) Food  (10 stars) Bar menu  (10 stars) Ambience  (20 stars). Just do it!"}
{"text":"Wow great Wine, bruschetta Burgers, sushi, & Wine. ........................................"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Alaska, found this amazing place by accident. The staff is awesome, found great food, better drinks and even a pretty girl. The only problem is the MUSIC, pretty sure I'm on the set of the 40 year old virgin."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is phenomenal!!! Curtains, fire pits, live singer/music, service. Short of 5 stars is the food. I ordered the chilaquiles and they are a tortilla stack you have to cut up yourself. The salsa and egg are delicious, but the tortillas are a little too tough to cut up and the chicken texture was a little odd for me (I'm Mexican so I'm picky).   4 stars because I still want to come back since their service and atmosphere is exceptional. There was a live singer when it sounded like a restaurant track. She was wonderful! They do have bottomless mimosas 10am-2pm Saturday & Sundays, plus their injectable donut holes are something I will always want to return for!!!  The menu says choose 2 flavors, but they will do all 3 for an additional cost. WORTH IT!!"}
{"text":"Our experience was disappointing.  The service was slow and the waitress seemed inconvenienced by having to take our order.  I had to change my order from the Oscar crepe, because they ran out of crab.  Both my husband and I had the Eggs Benedict.  Unfortunately, the hollandaise sauce was bland, the English muffin was too charred, and the price was too high for the meal.  Additionally, there was no salad, fresh fruit or potatoes served with the Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"I don't like to leave bad reviews and go on and on about our experience at this place my wife and I have been there twice. But all the ones and two stars at this place they nailed it right on the head this place SUCK!!! I Give It 2 Stars cuz I feel sorry for the owner  of this place"}
{"text":"Great food and bottomless mimosas on Sunday for brunch.  The living room set up is a cool idea, but it is not so convenient when youre sitting on couches and need to eat steak & eggs. Kinda awkward.   But regardless, we would come back for the mimosas and maybe just a light brunch like a pastry or something you can easily eat while relaxing on the sofas. Or perhaps sit on the regular tables :)"}
{"text":"Saltiest hash browns in the world. I hope they know there's more ways to season hash browns then just with salt   I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich because i wanted hash browns, but now I wish i had just ordered the Chicken & Waffles. Food was mildly average.   Service - the service is pretty good. They refill your water and bottomless mimosas pretty often"}
{"text":"Much, much better than Chandler location!! Bar tender and waiters very friendly!  Food was great too! DJ was way outta touch with music."}
{"text":"My company had a luncheon here and it was awesome. The food was great, especially the ciabatta with fig and prosciutto (?) and the ciabatta with mozzarella, tomato, basil and sweet balsamic. Everyone enjoyed the wine and drinks and the deserts were equally good, highly recommend the injectable donut holes they were really fresh and tasty. I wasn't able to drink due to pregnancy but they had ginger beer which was great rather then normal ginger ale. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and comfy seating. A fun place to bring out of towners."}
{"text":"We got here at 3 on a Friday and there were plenty of seats..by 4 the place was packed and you could bearly get to the bathroom. The service was really good and so was the food:)"}
{"text":"Nice décor, but I was not impressed with the food on my first visit.  Menu is very busy, seems they are trying to be all things to all people.  The sushi rolls were fair, I would not order them again.  The bruschetta was good.  I wanted the sliders but was advised by my son that they were way to salty the last time he ordered them.  Probably not going back.  It was nice but not memorable.  I ordered a glass of Zin but it tasted like cough syrup. When the waiter asked how the wine was, I told him and he just looked at me and didn't even offer to swap it out for something else."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite weekend brunch place. Mimosas are great and the chilaquiles are amazing. All the food I have had here is good. The patio is awesome, relaxing couches and fans. Inside it very trendy, but not pretentious.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch often. It is the perfect place to get some food, have a drink, and relax. Alisha is one of the best servers I've had in my life. Honest, straight forward, and funny. If you've never been here, I definitely recommend it. The French dip sandwich is amazing and the happy hour beer prices can't be beat. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Very good nighttime drinking spot. Coming here after a movie with a friend and it immediately became a new favorite. Great drink selection and very cozy and private. I love the vibe, it's like a little piece of the grown 'n sexy city right here in AHW."}
{"text":"Signed up for a groupon for brunch...very disappointing all around. We showed up at 10:25 and everything seemed fine at first. Took a little while for our server to come to us but someone else brought water so that was good. We ordered for my wife, myself and my 3 year old and all seemed fine. Then the waiting started. We waited. And waited. And waited. And then of all things my wife's dish comes out and she proceeds to be able to eat all of it prior to my chicken and waffles and more importantly my 3 year olds eggs and bacon came out. Sort of restaurant 101 to ensure a 3 year old kid gets his food no worse than same time as his mom, especially when its something so simple as eggs and bacon. On top of all this waiting, my chicken and waffle came out and it was clear the waffle sat for a long period before the chicken was ready. On a side note, the chicken was good, however, it was near impossible to get the ice cold butter to melt on the luke warm waffle. I needed a knife to cut into the waffle it was so cold. And then more waiting ensued. Not one person asked how our food was. My wife took our kid to the car in frustration while I waited for the bill. Our server never came so I had to walk inside to track her down to pay the bill. Based on food quality and terrible service, I can't see myself every coming back here."}
{"text":"I actually felt like I was in my living room, as in if I wanted something to eat or drink I'd have to get up and get it myself.  I'm not going to attack the individual who served our overwhelming party of five, because I believe it's a problem as a whole that they are understaffed.  This happens to be my first and of course my last experience at this location."}
{"text":"Great Happ Hour options. The ambiance was nice and they had tons of drink options to please everyone. The HH options had a good variety whether you want sushi, pretzels, chips or all of the above. Will defiantly return back for HH."}
{"text":"This is a great little place to meet a friend for a glass of wine. I'm such a devotee of Postino that their menu doesn't really appeal to me food wise but I hear that their Sunday brunch is amazing so I'll have to come back and try that sometime with their mimosas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the neighborhood.  Andrea, Preston, Chris and others know how to take care of their customers.  The atmosphere is cool and relaxed and the acoustic guitar just adds to the whole experience.  Don't leave without trying the awesome fries and raw oysters!"}
{"text":"The Living room is one of my favorite restaurants to go to! I love all items on the menu and the wine selection is great! The patio and ambiance just make everything better! Andrea is always my server and finds a way to brighten my day every time!"}
{"text":"Their menu is attractive and the restaurant has a very nice curb appeal.  They have daily specials and a 15% discount for AMC movie go'ers.  We had lunch there and we like the comfortable dining room.  Food tasted good, portion are rather large. Unfortunately, we were turned off by our waitress food handling and the restaurant has obvious sanitation violations. Waitress was eating food behind counter near coffee machine. Didn't wash her hands in between. Personal beverages were all over the kitchen and bar counters. Waitress handled silverware and napkins to be rolled together on dirty table and with her dirty hands, went back and forth to the plate she was eating from. Sanitation bucket was in direct contact with dining room floor in full sight. See pictures documenting the above. We will not return."}
{"text":"Great place to go for bottomless mimosas, food is yummy, depends on what you like, I love French toast, my significant God sheila's which was very yummy, it was his first time ordering it, but I would have most definitely order it again, I suggest this place is very good."}
{"text":"Well..... The happy hour at this place has some decent prices..... And the decor is cute..... And the drinks were large.... But all of the drinks were so sweet! They tasted good on first sip, but quickly became cloyingly sweet. It could have been the bartender that day, maybe she was a little heavy handed with the simple syrup or something, but it didn't make me want to run back here. On the plus side, Ahwatukee doesn't have many happy hours, so it's nice that they have one at all. Additionally, they have super cheap sangria all the time (4$ I think) .... It isn't amazing.... But it's OK. The prices on food are pretty high, especially for apps on hh, so we skipped the food, but their pretzels smelled good.... So there's that. Bottom line: you could do worse in Ahwatukee for sure, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a date or a group, the only downside would be the space. You feel like you packed in like a can of sardines unless you're outside and maybe on the bar area.   Always passed by and from outside it looks lively, packed and same time very well decorative.  The name says it all with lounge style chairs making you feel welcomed.    Even though it was packed we were sat right away and helped right away as well. The staff was friendly and the service was quick with drinks and food.   The best part about drinks $4 sangrias which you can't go wrong with. I ordered the Honey I'm not coming home, very tastefull not strong and could of gone for another one   The food was good, got the prime rib sliders which tasted excellent with the horseradish.  Also got the Korean steak lettuce cups, only bad part in this was not enough meat or sauce was mainly the lettuce.   What took us to the edge was the doughnut dessert which you can infuse with three different fillers like chocolate and berries.   Overall we will be back"}
{"text":"This place is great! It has a really nice atmosphere and a good wine selection. I think the appetizers might be a little pricey for what you get. We ordered the meat and cheese board. It was good but not worth $15. I would definitely return"}
{"text":"The ambient was great. Service was great. Food (I believe the fries or caprese salad made me and a friend sick. I mean hunched over stomach gurgling sick. The manager or host (man) wasn't very friendly. Most likely would not return."}
{"text":"Been coming to this Living Room for a few months now, and it's never been a disappointment. The good food, great drink selection, and friendly staff always make me want to come back.   Some of my favorite dishes for lunch or dinner are the pretzels (recommend the Brie cheese), the prime rib sliders, and the KIG sushi roll. Their brunch is delicious too. The chilaquiles is my favorite, not to mention their bloody Mary's and bottomless mimosas.   The staff here are great. I love how they share tables, you can always get what you need from anyone, with a quick response.   Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I am hesitant to leave this review because I really don't like to leave negative reviews. However, I can't get over how rudely I was treated and just have to speak up.  We arrived at 5:40 last night and walked up to the hostess station, no other patrons around us, and asked for a table of 2. The host, a man with a shaved head, said it would be around 20 mins. I responded and said  \"Oh....we are hoping to catch Happy Hour\" (which ended at 6pm). I expected he might then offer a suggestion, like \"you can go sit at the bar\" or \"let me put your name on our list and hopefully get you a table asap\".  Instead of that kind of response, or even any response at all to me,  he literally turned away, completely ignored what I just said, and started talking to another patron who had just walked up after us and asked them \"Do you want to get on the list for a table?\"  Errrrrr....what just happened?  I was taken aback and in shock. We were just having a conversation and now you've turned away and started ignoring me. We wanted to get on the list for a table. It was extremely odd and outrageously rude. I basically got brushed off and he went on to the person behind us who had obviously walked up after us. I looked at my husband and said \"Lets get out of here\" and we walked out.   My husband was super pissed and gave the guy the finger as we walked out. I realize that was a bit harsh but he was mad as a hornet that I was treated so rudely.  Of course, that got the manager's attention and suddenly he freed himself from prioritizing the other patron and ran out after my husband asking in a rather hostile tone  \"What is the problem????\"  My husband told him about how rude he was and why we were pissed, and his response was simply, \"They were first\".  No apology. No offer of a solution.   When we walked up, no one else was there. The other people obviously came in after us, I saw them walk up behind us.    My sense of what happened is that the \"host\"/manager determined that we were not worth his time since we were dressed very casual and disheveled after a long day, my husband tatooed in a baseball cap and shorts, me with no makeup, and that the clean cut guy in a polo shirt who came in after us with a girl in a dress were more important and worth attention and priority. We felt judged and dismissed like we were trying to get into an exclusive club that has a dress code or something.  We are foodies and we know a lot of people in the industry and my husband has worked in nice restaurants throughout the valley himself. We live in close by affluent Warner Ranch, and we spend a lot of money on food and wine. They lost a very good potential repeat customer by treating us that way. I'm still in shock that it even happened.   I really tried every which way to see it as some kind of misunderstanding because I didn't want to believe that we were intentionally treated that rudely. But I can't come up with a good reason or excuse for that behavior.   Instead of chasing us down to diffuse the obviously escalated situation, he was instead confrontational and adversarial toward us, asserting that the other couple was there first and really just being a dick. Had he approached us and said, \"Hey, there must be some misunderstanding, I'm not sure what happened, what can I do to rectify it?\" the whole situation could have played out differently and we would have been forgiving, because maybe he really didn't realize he was being a dick and now wants to not be a dick. But he basically added fuel to the fire and was argumentative.   The guy's attitude and responses to us felt more like a fight with a strip club bouncer and not a manager of wine bar.    As a host/manager I expect friendlier customer service and better problem solving skills, so that if a patron feels like they were just treated rudely, the situation can be positively worked out so that everyone is happy again. As a human being, I expect common courtesy. The rudeness was truly shocking. I'm sad that this person's behavior reflects poorly on this restaurant as a whole  because i'm sure there are many positive things about it as well, minus THAT guy."}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's day for some desert and a cocktail was not busy at all. The food/drink tasted great!  It was the service or lack there of that brought it down to 2 stars. Inattentive and uninformative waitress. Did not inform us of the hours, specials etc. Borderline rude. The Ocotillo location is better, a shame because we love the living room and were excited to go to one in our neighborhood"}
{"text":"Yep,  new hot spot.   The Prime rib sliders.... Amazing.   Cheese fondue,  who doesn't like cheese with bread or pretzel or cauliflower.   The beer drinker in me switched to a delicious  Rose',  refreshing.   The atmosphere on Sunday at 3pm,  energetic.   Wine selection is a breath of fresh air for wine drinkers,  beer drinkers they have bottles and a few favorites on draft. Dull bar as well"}
