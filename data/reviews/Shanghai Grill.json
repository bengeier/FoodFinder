{"text":"Great Food.  General Tso's and Egg Foo Yong is the best.  I have not had anything I didn't like yet.  We go to this restaurant at least once a month and are never disappointed.  If you like good Asian food try this place."}
{"text":"I come to this place often, the foods are really good. The only problem that I am having is that there is this skinny tall busboy or server always with a kind of a beanie on he is never friendly and when he deliver food to us he just kinda slam it on the table. The other night I was there and I heard he got into an argument with the owner as the owner was asking him to do something and he refused. He was yelling and being very rude. Overall I will definitely come back to dine in."}
{"text":"I have been to the Shanghai Grill many times but won't be returning. Apparently business is not doing too good because they seem to be reducing quantities especially in the drink category. My wife and I ordered martinis and I have never seen such small glasses. The wine glasses are also much smaller that they used to be.  Service was mediocre at best. The steamed rice was not warm so we sent it back to be heated. Instead of doing as we asked the waitress brought a new serving of rice that wasn't any warmer than the original serving. We visited on a Saturday night and there was hardly anyone else there. My only guess is that other customers have been as disappointed as we were."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give these people 0 stars. I used to work at SHANGHAI GRILL when I was 15, it was my first job so I was not aware of how bad their abuse was until I finally quit and got a proper job. I only worked there for a few months but in that time I was belittled and constantly harassed. I was called stupid and pathetic daily. I went home crying multiply times, and it wasn't until much later did I realize that not only were the abusing all of us who worked there, but they were shortening us on our pay and tips. Working there was one of the worst experiences of my life. It wasn't until after I left did I realize how bad it truly was. In my time working there I saw some tremendous health hazards. They would re-use rice from old customers, and I mean literally they would just take it from dirty plates that people just ate off and the management would but it back in the big pot. In thier fridge they put raw meat and cooked meat together. The cooks in the back were always covered in sweat and never washed their hands. They were just covered in grim wiping the sweat and continued cookin. And I would witness multiple times them dropping food and picking it back up. It was horrid. For the people who enjoyed the food here, I truly advise never going here again for the sake of your health. Im begging and hoping one day they get shut down by a health inspector. It amazes me that they are still open."}
{"text":"Our first time here, after driving half an hour to try the place out. A mish mash of Asian dishes, some of which are hit and miss. We had the lettuce wraps appetizer, teriyaki chicken and Korean sizzling short ribs. The taste and sauces on all three were pretty good. The chicken was tender. But there was too little meat in the filling for the wraps - it was mostly just water chestnut. The ribs were not sizzling but lukewarm and were also the toughest I've ever had. Could not even eat half of the dish. The Chef or manager (he didn't introduce himself) made a lot of excuses when he came over to address the problem, like 'people' around here want their meat well done. Well done and overcooked are two different things. Service was below par, with only one waiter trying to keep up with dine in and take out customers. Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Unfortunately due to the owner I will NEVER go back.  I am speaking of the lady, not Tony.  The food is good and that is why I had returned several times.  The problem is the way the lady owner treats her staff.  Every time I have been here while she is present, she is yelling and bossing her staff around in a very demeaning way.  I have seen her do this and have spoke to her staff and they have a hard time with it as do I.  The final straw was when I was waiting at the bar for my food within ear shot of the kitchen, i heard her yelling at on of her waitresses and she actually brought her to tears.  As a customer, I should not have to have my lunch ruined by such nonsense.  I had my food delivered but was so frustrated that I asked for a box and my bill.  When my server brought them to me the lady owner came up and stood beside her wanting to know what was going on.  I told her I could not stand the way you treat your staff and let her know that is the case every time she is there.  She tried to tell me what the girl did, and I said I do not care what she did and I do not make excuses for the rudeness.  Tony, take some advice and get her out of there before she ruins your business.  I have enjoyed the restaurant when you are present and do like the food very much."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant previous to tonight I think it has changed hands, people were disorganized tonight, no change in till, food was bland and lacked the flavor it has previously had"}
{"text":"Had the general tso's and Kung pow chicken. Both were good. Service was good as well. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the sizzling rice soup as a bowl and the server failed to tell us that if we got the combo meal it would come with soup. Then after we already ordered the soup I asked if we could cancel it and just get combos and the manager said no. Terrible customer service. I will never be back."}
{"text":"I ordered take out, but was instantly impressed with the decor of this place. No 1970's warehouse here! The manager was very nice, explaining why my food was taking a little longer than anticipated. I noticed a bar off to one side where a few people were eating and drinking. Mostly booths, but a handful of tables in the middle. The wait staff didn't seem overworked or especially busy.  But let's move on to the food. Now I have had one meal from the china palace and found it disappointing because the food was so tasteless, under seasoned. But shanghai grill is a different story. Mongolian beef, beef chop suey, and chicken fried rice, all wonderful. The egg rolls were not greasy, and they must use a peanut or sesame oil to fry them in, because they were delicious. Definitely a great carry out, and probably dine in too!! Can't wait to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"The food here is quite impressive.  They serve a variety of Asian style dishes, not just Chinese (given the name).  The atmosphere is nice on the inside and the prices are very reasonable.  I had the Sun Devil Chicken, which was a Vietnamese inspired spicy dish and it was quite tasty.  I can't wait to go back and try out a few more items from the menu.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Cannot get better service, better food or better value for your money than at Shanghai Grill We are there almost every week and we love it. In lobster season best quality and largest lobsters served to perfection. It's our destination stop for Chinese food. We are on the way there now. Try it you'll love it"}
{"text":"I have been going there pretty much once a week since I moved here three years ago. Was there last week with my daughter who was in from Florida and her best friend from Scottsdale for lunch. Both gals have been there with me before as well. I ordered one of my typical dishes and the girls ordered Sesame Chicken and Orange Chicken. They could hardly eat a bight of the entrees as they said the chicken tasted very fatty and did not eat any more of the entree. I pointed out the situation to Tony the owner who too was our server that day because it was busier than normal and they were understaffed and that being the reason he was serving, and all he could do was dispute the chicken could have been fatty because it was white meat. As he picked up the girls plates he squished up in his hands the chicken next to our table to I guess prove it was not fatty. Very uncomfortable scene indeed. Evidently the breading was not I am guessing totally cooked, or old or whatever making it rather squishy.  He took their plates off the bill and said \"I hope you have a better afternoon than lunch  rather snidely\". I because of his totally out of line attitude and comments will never return and I certainly hope he gets the opportunity to read this."}
{"text":"Whenever we come or any of our family comes to Phoenix this is the restaurant we all agree we must visit before we leave. The walnut shrimp is superb. Also the plum wine is excellent. Don't miss this little restaurant it has fantastic food and service."}
{"text":"Ordered their house lo mein, the noodle was very soggy. Flavor was so-so, nothing special about it. Also ordered an order of the potstickers, it was very doughy. The soy sauce for dipping was good though. Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"Food 1/3; Service/ambiance 2/2  This place's visual aesthetics are nice, but for the price and quality of food, I don't think I'll be coming back. The staff was kind. This restaurant gave the feel of a sort of 'fancy' westernized Chinese place. However, the dishes were very salty and not very large."}
{"text":"This is resturant was such a great find when I was living near Arrowhead.  My children love their food.  The service is fast and the servers are always friendly.  They have amazing crab puffs and my faving is Sun Devil Chicken.  Yummy!  You won't go home hungry.  I have always eat my left overs for lunch the next day!!"}
{"text":"Great food, I especially like the orange chicken and crab puffs.  My six year old  daughter loves the egg drop soup, it's become one of her favorite foods.  Great decor, very soothing, cool, and calm place to have lunch or dinner. The manager seems to really care that you enjoy your meal.  The bathroom is always clean and nicely decorated, too!"}
{"text":"The management is a bunch of douche bags.  Anyone who berates their staff in front of their guests does not deserve the business this place does.  Besides that, they take 90 percent of the tips the wait staff brings in.    Don't go here.  The owners are a-holes and their staff deserve better.  I can't believe the rating this place has given the experience the employees and guests have reported here.  Seems to me the owners are trying to do some damage control by getting their friends and family to post positive comments based on loyalty and not true experience.  If you want food poisoning then go here and try the shrimp that was left out overnight.  If you want to see someone cry, go here on a night the bit** manager is working and berating her employees.  F*** this place."}
{"text":"Place is very clean and the wait staff attentive.  However,  the food that comes out of the kitchen is just good.   Nothing special about it.   In my opinion is just not worth the prices on the menu.  But over all experience is good.  We will see if it was good enough to tempt me to return, as of now it's up in the air."}
{"text":"This is solidly decent fast casual Chinese. It rates above Good China which is just down the street. If you are looking for some quick take out or even a bite in, it's worth the visit."}
{"text":"Good clean environment with great food!  Our waitress was very nice and answered our questions.  We had several different dishes that were all delish.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was very good I had the  garlic chicken house specialty...I also had an egg roll and hot & sour soup.  We were waited on by a new waitress and we tried to be as patient as possible but we never got refills on our water or soup until we flagged down the busser...this was the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars...we watched as it appeared to be 3 new servers running around as the manager decided to sit back and never get involved...why?  Good question!  We have been here several test and the food has always been good...the service usually better...we most likely will be back"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is always friendly and the food is excellent! The ambiance is warm and inviting and I love the piano music."}
{"text":"My Husband and I went on a food hunt, We usually do the \"what are you in the mood for, I don't know what are you in the mood for\" dance, Well tonight we both wanted Chinese but wanted to try some where new. We have passed this place several times and decided to give them a try.  They were extremely polite, they were tastefully decorated, not like your usual out of style, hole in the wall, things tucked in corners under age kids camped in the corner while their mother worked Chinese place.  Prices were reasonable and the portions were plentiful. I had the Cantonese style chow mein, it was very good Spring rolls were cooked perfectly! My husband had the Pad Thai, He prefers his on the spicier side, theirs was more on the sweet side, not bad but not really what he was looking for.  We have both decided that they are definitely a new favorite and with in walking distance from our house, we will probably become regulars."}
{"text":"We took our order to go.. We got some egg rolls, an order of orange chicken and kung pao chicken. It was all pretty good. We have had better but this is defiantly a place I would go back to."}
{"text":"I had honey garlic chicken. Good flavor and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I've only ordered take out, so vie never experienced a sit down meal in this place. So just reviewing off purly food. I really really like this place. And I'm born in new york, so ive tasted really good Chinese food before.  This place is decently priced and overall great tasting food.  Plus is literally down the street from my apt.  Always a plus."}
{"text":"The wonton strips were salty... I've never had wonton strips like these... were they even fried wonton strips? And they were served with what tasted like a bad cocktail sauce. The soups were ok and the general tao was typical."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the quality of food here.  I decided to try out this place because it was really close to my new apartment and I had a BOGO coupon.  It seems as if the restaurant was recently remodeled inside.  The decor was new and up to date with style, unlike some Chinese restaurants I have been to.  There was a mixed blend of cultures present, also including the staff.  We got there in time for happy hour, so we ended up getting our beers for fairly cheap!  We started with the Sizzling Rice soup, which was delicious.  The waiter seemed to be a novice when it came to putting the rice in, because he spilled some of it on our table.  Immediately after the management saw, they rushed over to make sure that everything was okay.  Great flavor.  You can easily split this between two people and still have some to take home.  I believe that I tried some sort of spicy chicken dish, and my fiance had the House Special Chicken.  The food came relatively quickly.  It was hot, flavorful, and gave us enough for plenty to take home.    The restaurant was fairly dead when we were in there.  I do not remember what day of the week it was.  Perhaps the majority of customers utilize their take-out option.  I would definitely recommend this place to someone if they are interested in trying a new Chinese restaurant.  I know it can be iffy at times, but this was well worth the risk.  ALSO, be sure to ask for the hot tea.  They will NOT give it to you unless you ask.  It is free of charge."}
{"text":"My kids LOVE this place. Clean, friendly and amazing , fresh food."}
{"text":"Been about 5 years since we ate here so thought we'd give it another try. Ordered the Korean Short Ribs and they were horrible! Chewy, fatty and just not good! And they charge $16 for them!  My wife had the Chicken Teriyaki and the chicken was grizzly and not good. Will never go back! Panda Express is better!"}
{"text":"We enjoy this Chinese food.  The owner is nice & the variety on the,menu is good.  My favorite  is Happy Family."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for two years so I thought it was time to leave a review. In my opinion, this is the best Chinese food in the west valley (we've tried most of them). Love the curried chicken and my husband thinks their chow mien is better than at a famous chain restaurant that is nearby. Prices are better too!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area, and I'm looking for a good Chinese restaurant. Sad to say, I am still looking. A few pros and cons in my opinion: Pros: food was hot, decent portions, decent prices. Cons: just bland tasting. (And they got my order wrong, but no biggie, we just wanted to try a few different things). Overall: food wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessarily good either. The search continues for awesome Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Lately the best thing about this place is the family that owns the place, it is clean and the new restaurant is nice and new. The food was extremely better when they were located at the hole in the wall location at 67th and Bethany Home Rd.  I used to eat the shrimp fried rice at least every week.  I am not able to go to Peoria often, I last went on a Saturday nite the prices were very high but business was good,  I didn't know where I was by that shrimp fried rice it was kind of tatsteless.  I think that was just a bad nite,  the other diners seemed to be happy. Maybe they changed the food to suit the palates of the current customers.  I love the family so much I will go again and tell them how I want my fried rice!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect lesson of not judging a book by its cover.  It's at the end of a ghost-town strip mall & I honestly thought this would be a typical divey Chinese restaurant.  WRONG! We walked in & were totally surprised by how \"restaurant-y\" (that's not a word, I know) it was! They had fountains & beautiful booths, the decor wasn't crazy cheesy either. We were seated right away by our friendly server.    I ordered the almond chicken with steamed rice & hubby ordered sweet & sour chicken with fried rice.  She dropped off 2 bowls of egg drop soup which was actually very tasty.  Our food came next & we were really happy with it. Perfect amount for lunch, it came with 2 won-tons, an egg roll & the rice.  Our dishes were pretty basic so it's kind of hard to mess them up but we will be back here again.  They were really flavorful & didn't taste like it was loaded with salt like some Chinese places do. The lunch prices were great too (around $6 per person I think)."}
{"text":"I just ordered food from Shanghai Grill delivered by DoorDash and it was hot, fresh and high quality. I got their Chicken and vegetables and Lo main and vegetables and I couldn't believe all the qaulity ingredients like bean sprouts and chestnuts etc. I've  lived in this area for sometime and never new this Chinese restaurant was in my area until I saw it on DoorDash's list of places to order food from; great way to discover new places. No more panda now!!!"}
{"text":"Good dinner ...good service... a little skimpy on the rice... we asked for some to go with our meals but they mixed it in rather then packing it separate... Unfortunately since we have kids... they don't like their rice touching the sauce so now the leftovers won't be enjoyed by all... Overall a great little cozy place to eat with  good food."}
{"text":"We went twice years ago.  A friend suggested.  DON'T EVER GO. The calamari was old, and dry.  The squid in garlic sauce had very little squid.  My wife ordered the roast duck.  It was old, dry and burned.  One of the worst meals I have ever had."}
{"text":"Food: Very good chinese-american cuisine, plus a couple Vietnamese and thai dishes. The sauces tasted \"made from scratch\", not from a can. The vegetables were plentiful and fresh.  The prices amazing for the quality. Service mediocre: There were more wait-staff strutting around then customers but they still took forever to take our order."}
{"text":"Second rate food... not worth the time or effort.   (M) did a great job taking care of us, would love to have her working in my place. She was polite and professional even when her obviously crazy boss (some lunatic Asian woman) chewed her out in the dining area in front of everyone.  Pass on this place."}
{"text":"This is a very unusual Multi Asian Style Restaurant that has a bar and also offers many seafood dishes. They offer familiar Asian dishes of many kinds and many interesting sounding Asian inspired dishes. The interior of the restaurant was very dark and filled with comfortable booths.  I tried the Vietnamese Sun Devil Chicken with brown rice. The chicken in my dish was tender and they gave a nice assortment of fresh vegetables. The sauce on the menu was described as spicy and aromatic but all I got was sweet and soy sauce. My waitress said they usually make this dish with jalapeños but I didn't get any and they just used a few red pepper flakes. It seems like they were out of jalapeños and a few other things.  My husband tried the Szechwan Meatballs that were suppose to be in Szechwan Sauce that was suppose to be DOUBLE HOT. My husband said the meatballs were tasty but the sauce was like sweet BBQ sauce that wasn't hot at all. Guess they were out of some more things here too. He did tell the waitress about the lack of heat and she said most people love that dish and told us to order it extra extra spicy next time.  It seems that this restaurant is a little hit and miss.  I'm giving it a generous three stars because the meatballs were tasty and the chicken was prepared well.  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of our favorite Asian restaurants in Peoria. Very nice ambiance. Clean and intimate. Full bar and happy hour specials.  The food is really great here! From the Walnut Shrimp to Honey Garlic Chicken, Lettuce Wraps, Beef Chow Fun...there is much to be pleased with at Shanghai Grill!  Lunch specials as well! Try it...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times since I think this is one of the better Chinese restaurants in the valley.  From their egg rolls to their main courses the food is always very tasty and service is always pretty good.  I always order the shrimp fried rice, egg role and the mangolian beef.  The restaurant is very nice and the decor is friendly, inviting and can be a great intimate setting."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and never had complaints with the flavor of the dishes. Typical American \"Chinese\" you find everywhere. What is remiss is the temperature of the food which was served tepid! Crab puffs, tepid, Mongolian Beef tepid! Nothing was served sizzling hot. Even the \" egg roll\" which is more like the Costco frozen spring rolls were served tepid. So disappointed!! When we get a yen for Chinese, we will go back one more time. If the food isn't served hot, it's bye for good. Two stars because the food wasn't hot."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the recent past.  After living in this area for 11 years, I can hardly believe that I had not heard of Shanghai Grill earlier.  Now, I know it is going to be my very favorite Asian Restaurant.  Had the Honey Walnut Shrimp both times but will definitely venture out and try other items in the future. My friends, who own a home in Westbrook Village, arrived from Seattle last evening for a three week visit and they, too, were super impressed! Talked on the phone this afternoon with Tony, the owner, to question him about the use of MSG, which he said is not even on the premise!  He did say, however, that powdered chicken broth is used in some dishes and if another friend who I want to bring there but is highly allergic to MSG comes in with me, he will suggest dishes that do not use that either.  VERY ACCOMODATING for sure!  Love, love, love this place."}
{"text":"Went here on my Lunch break, I got the Sweet and Sour Chicken Lunch Special, a lot of food!  It came with Rice, Crab Puff and An Egg Roll, everything was delicious!  This will be thrown into the rotation."}
{"text":"You must understand I'm comparing this restaurant to Good China - just a half block away.  So.... Atmosphere...very nice Wait Staff...excellent luncheon special...great choice egg rolls....ahhhh, not as good by far chicken chow mein and kung pau chicken...good, but not as flavorful fried rice...not nearly as flavorful  So........back to Good China for sure"}
{"text":"Table was not clean, had to wait for them to come and wipe it again, then we noticed soy all over the seat. Daughter ordered a strawberry smoothie, they had to come back to the table twice, like they had no idea this was even on the kids menu. When they brought it, a different server, they said it was a strawberry daiquiri. We were seriously concerned that they put alcohol in it. We asked for an Arnold Palmer, they brought back only tea. We asked about the pictures on the menu which apparently don't match up with the page they are on. Didn't get utensils either."}
{"text":"This place was right down the street from my old apartment so my roommate and I used to go twice a week for a sake bomb and food. I have had pretty much everything there. All of the food is great, nothing i didn't like. the service is also great, never have to wait for anything. The ambiance has a classy but at home feeling. the people that work there give you the feeling of at home but he furnishings, music, and lighting are classy. The place is very clean and I will say this, THAT PLACE HAS THE CLEANEST, COOLEST AND NICEST BATHROOMS."}
{"text":"I normally do not leave negative reviews mainly because I don't patronize business that get poor ratings. The great majority of my experiences at the restaurants I frequent are on par with the ratings that most Yelpers leave.   Not quite so this time...  This was by far one of my most disappointing experiences.   Upon entering I was greeted by fairly enjoyable ambiance and a loud and rather mean looking Asian hostess. Giving Shanghai Grill the benefit of the doubt, my party and I decided to still try their decent food selection.   We ordered their \"famous\" honey garlic chicken, lemon grass chicken, asian chicken salad, and chicken egg foo yung. The food was all very good.  The lemon grass chicken was tasty and not too sweet. The honey garlic chicken was also light and garlicky but a tad on the sweet side (not so much honey sweet but more sugar sweet).   The main reason Shanghai Grill earned their one star from me was not because of the food or their funny tasting piña colada which they remade for my wife but ended up still tasting funny.   No, this \"Asian\" restaurant with its \"Asian\" workers didn't botch the \"Asian\" food. It was the Asian hostess/manager lady in the front who earned their \"star of shame\". I presented a coupon (because I'm Asian) to the Asian waiter (who coincidentally was extremely nice) upon being seated and was told I could use it. At the end of our meal, the Asian hostess/manager lady showed up at our table and chided me for using the coupon incorrectly. When I tried to explain that I had already confirmed with the waiter that the coupon could be used, she said \"he Asian, he stupid, he don't know anything.\"    I'm pretty much going out on a limb here but, I'm thinking she just insulted me and the other two people in her vicinity including herself.   She then proceeded to drag the waiter across the room and chide him probably for telling me I could use the coupon. She then came back and told me she would take $2 off our bill and I could still use the coupon at a later date.   Now, I'm pretty thick skinned when it comes to racial comments, but for that nutty lady to go spouting off about how stupid Asians are in front of my kids is unacceptable. In my book, racial comments are absolutely inappropriate at the dinner table regardless of who is saying it and who it's directed to. But that's just my $0.02.   BTW, I do think Asians, specifically Chinese people are stupid with all their dog eating festivals and what not but so are the people in every other ethnic group, culture, and country. We are all humans and by definition we do dumb things but, another aspect of humanity is the ability to forgive which the Asian hostess/manager lady did not exhibit.   I just hope that poor waiter can forgive the hostess/manager lady and the hostess/manager lady can forgive me for writing the truth about her. I have already forgiven them both but have also learned never to patronize their establishment again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese ever!!!!  The staff amazing, but mostly it's wonderful food!! The drinks are wonderful.....I am very picky about my Chinese food....I-like authentic ....this is totally authentic!!"}
{"text":"The have FOX News on in the bar, interesting and edgy for a Asian Restaurant. The establishment needs a face lift especially the parking lot and strip mall, better wine glasses, i recommend Riedel. The inside has been modernized, come early to beat the crowd. Despite what I just said we've been waiting way to long for a very simple order. My wife ordered a glass of KJ Chardonnay it was oxidized, terrible. They did give her another glass from a newly opened bottle The misting system outside is kind of tacky, water leaking onto entry way. Water Feature in entrance needs to be cleaned and kept in working condition. Egg Drop Soup was very tasty and hot, the way a soup should be served. Asian Salad was just okay, egg rolls so, so. Chicken Chow Me in with Crispy Noodles, fair. Just wasn't what we expected. Julian our server was very nice, kind and attentive. I don't think we'll be going back unfortunately as we are looking for a great Asian Restaurant in the West valley. The YELP posts were very miss leading. Bummer"}
{"text":"Came here thinking they had sushi as well, but they didnt. :/ However service is good and portions are good. I got the pad thai. Probably won't order it again, but I would come back again and try something else. Great selection."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best Chinese in the area. We had the shrimp and asparagus special and Mongolian beef. Both were superb!!!!"}
{"text":"I came with my father here and we got the dinner for two (non seafood). i really liked it. I did the wonton soup, peanut dumpling entree and the meat dishes. Its a nice quiet place. The food is good quality and the service was incredible. Im looking forward to going again and i would recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Hospitality was great. Our waitress was on point with everything. The food was tasty. I loved the coconut pineapple ice cream."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good lunch specials, but the silence in the place was deafening! Please turn on some music!!  Also, it was not clear what items were fried or not in the descriptions of the dishes so make sure to ask."}
{"text":"Great first experience, the food was very good and the serving sizes were Good size.  Service was excellent and very attentive. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is really good; I especially like their egg foo yung dish.  Decor is nice once you look past the gawdy neon light in the front window."}
{"text":"Very low quality product, wouldn't recommend. Staff seem like they are doing you a favour for letting you eat at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I do like the food. The food doesn't taste like it's been drenched in salt. The mai tais are awesome. But they can't seem to make a gin and tonic. Vodka was used instead of Gin. Two different alcohols. The Pu Pu platter is my favorite appetizer. And my favorite is the Mongolian beef. And they serve a chicken dish, which I forgot the name, which is so good. Service has been okay and the prices are okay. I just wish they delivered."}
{"text":"BEWARE! I went here for lunch a few days ago.  Here is what happened.  The service was slow, the waiter was pretty bad.  The food was cold, little flavor, not good. We wanted to leave, I asked for the bill, it was wrong in two sections, I mentioned that to the waiter, he went back and corrected one part.  Still overcharging. But I just wanted to leave.  He took over 10 minutes to just correct the one part.  We wanted a quick lunch, it took over an hour and a half.  When the check finally came, I signed and left.  When I went to my next stop I noticed my credit card was gone.  I immediately knew that the waiter did not return it.  I called the restaurant, they acted innocent and dumb about the whole thing, so I drove over there, over an additional hour round trip.  Although, tony, the manager seemed really helpful and was looking for the card, the waiter looked very guilty.  I told them that if the card did not show up, I was going to call the police.  Sure enough I got a call that night that the card miraculously and mysteriously showed up.  Of course I had already canceled the card and had to call all the companies that direct bill.  Don't go here, you will regret it, and you might just have your credit card stolen as well."}
{"text":"Ewwwwwwh!  My husband and I were starving and using my normal Yelp process to find somewhere in the area to eat I saw this place which had pretty decent reviews.  We decided on Shanghai.  What a huge mistake.  First.... I seriously doubt that the \"photos\" on yelp are updated.  Most of them are from 2 to 3 years old.  I think they used something else.  Definitely not even close to what we actually received on our plate.  I am a pad thai FAN and the photo looked so appetizing I ordered it.  When my plate came out I knew immediately that this was a bad choice.  My pad thai was orange in color, it was sooooooo bland, no flavor except the sweet and sour-ish sauce.  Noodles weren't pad thai noodles either.  Such a disappointment.  My husband tried General tso and it was just as bland and flavorless as my dish.    We realized half way through dinner (honestly, we wouldn't have eaten it had we not been so hungry. Its amazing how you can rationalize eating something that tastes like crap when you are starving....lol) that we were the only \"young\" couple in the place.  Explains a lot.  And the reviews.  Everyone is pushing 60+.  I am sure when I get to that age, I'll probably like the place, but until then Ill look for somewhere else who uses spices, flavor and makes real pad thai!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their hot and sour soup. I usually get it to go. The atmosphere is just ok, but the food is good. The sizzling rice soup is really good. Pad Thai is excellent."}
{"text":"Was looking around for somewhere new and checked it out.  It took an extra moment to get seated but, I'm glad that didn't deter me away. Food was flavorful and awesome.  Got the banana shrimp on special and I recommend it twice over.  Moo goo was ordered by another and it also got rave reviews   Will definitely come back and bring more people."}
{"text":"Was there last night - Yuchi!  I don't know what happened to this place since it used to be good about a year ago. Service was horrible and the food had no flavor.  We ordered ginger sauce on tilapia and the tilapia was overcooked and dry.  We ordered it spicy yet no spice.  Had happy family and also asked for it to be medium spicy - no spice. We ordered the sun devil chicken which was better than the others but not great.  Waiter was inattentive.  Asked for water three times and still never brought to all three of us.  He didn't seem to care that two of the three items were not prepared properly.   We ordered three meals with the combo which included soup, egg roll, and crab puff.  Hot and sour soup was ok - a little too sweet and not very spicy.  The waiter brought 2 of the three platters and it took another 8 minutes for him to bring the other dish.  He could have brought the additional crab puff and egg roll separate so that the third person could begin eating.  We told the woman at the register about the problem but it still wasn't resolved.   There are too many good restauants in town - don't waste a meal here."}
{"text":"Ok.  Went there last night.  We don't have a lot of choices way out here in the West Valley.  The service and food were great.  Tables were clean.  Curry chicken and shrimp fried rice were both excellent.  I'll be coming back again.  If you want to try some good Chinese food this is the place.  Take out also."}
{"text":"Had lunch on 6/20/2014. Both my wife and I were most impressed with quality and price. House chicken was good. Soups were excellent. We must go back for dinner.  RVT"}
{"text":"Awesome food for take out :D Only dined in once, it was mediocre- but their food is definitely one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"REALLY enjoyed this place. My parents found it in the newspaper a few months back, and have been raving about it. I was in town over Turkey Day, and they brought me. PHENOMENAL food. The Kung Pao beef was unbelievable. I won't even waste my time trying to tell you why, because there are just no words--go order it! The Sun Devil chicken was equally amazing, my mouth is watering as I type. Great / fast service and very modern spin (decor-wise) on a Chinese restaurant. Shanghai Grill only affirms my believe that the BEST of the best restaurants are found in strip malls. I HIGHLY recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Loved Shanghai Grill! We picked up a takeout order here last night. The food is so good! We had egg rolls and crab puffs as well as house lo mein and kung pao beef. Everything was delicious and ready 15 minutes after I placed the order. This will be our new take out Chinese pick!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Sweet and Sour chicken was fresh and tasty.  Fried rice marginal.  Crab puffs avarage.  Hot and Sour soup ok but served warm.  Service ok but not overwelming.  Pepsi products.  Haven't explored Sun City West to know if others better or worse."}
{"text":"I can't get enough sun devil chicken... it's fantastic.  Lunch special is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"After moving from Seattle we had a hard time finding good Chinese food, so we were delighted to find this spot! Good food, good service. Bartender needs to work on a few things... they had never heard of an Electric Ice Tea or a  Lemon Drop."}
{"text":"Good food.  I like getting the dinner with the egg roll soup and fried rice.  We have tried several dishes and all have been good.   We like the orange chicken. The Mongolian beef and the beef with broccoli.   I will be back it's a nice place for dinner."}
{"text":"Just okay. Went there for dinner on a Wednesday night. We were seated right away, but had to wait quite awhile for the waiter. I ordered sweet and sour chicken, my husband ordered sweet and sour combo. Husband's soup came before his hot tea arrived. After the soup was dropped off at our table we realized that we had no silverware or napkins. We had to wait at least 5 minutes, until our waiter brought the tea, to ask for the silverware. When our entrées where brought out, they were barely warm. I asked another waiter to please get the manager. I told the manager my food was just warm and asked if I could get hot food. He said the server must have left it sitting too long before serving it, and took it back to the kitchen. About 10 minutes later, I was brought back the same plate, and the food was now very hot. (Don't know why it took so long to microwave it) The food did taste good other than the sauce being a little too heavy on the sweet side. Oh, and as we were leaving, I saw another table get their food without any silverware on their table.( I think they need a better system.)"}
