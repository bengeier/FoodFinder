{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! My husband and I have been going here for a while now. They have the best soft Carmel's! I have never been to a shop quite like this. Every thing in there is fantastic. The owners and their workers are very friendly. They are always in the back coming up with something new. And they always listen to what their customers say!"}
{"text":"After reading about how wonderful this local business is on Facebook, I stopped in to buy some candy and a Rocky Road caramel apple.  Everything was very tasty!  It's great to have a made-from-scratch candy shop so close by!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood store that has fabulous treats at really great prices. My son loves picking out something special and the lovely staff never makes you feel that there is a minimum order. The salted caramels are a must and the marshmallow caramel bomb was amazing."}
{"text":"I am usually not a sweets fan,  but i make the exception for Sugar-Luv. We drove 45 minutes from Cleveland for homemade caramels and truffles, but ended up taking home much more because they are always trying new things.  I can't wait to try the candied cranberries!"}
{"text":"If you like sweets then you need to visit Sugar-Luv Confections! This is honestly the best place around!  This is a small shop on a quaint little street in Cuyahoga Falls. Everything is made from scratch in the kitchen which is viewable from the showroom. The smell of fresh chocolate or caramel cooking always adds to the ambiance of visiting!  The owner, Shannon, consistently shows a passion for creating the best candy and desserts. They are famous for their salted caramels and have many ways to consume them; by themself, covered in chocolate, coating a pretzel, and more!  Some of my favorites are dark chocolate covered fruits and the homemade s'mores which are made from homemade marshmallows, homemade chocolate and homemade graham crackers! The gooey bars are excellent as well.  I took a few pictures of some of these delicious treats in my studio after bringing them home. They truly are as good as the look!"}
{"text":"There are so many words I could use to describe this place but I will settle with PERFECT!  The owners are kind and very personable,  as well as their staff. You walk in the door and can feel the positive energy! The price is very low considering the product and the fact you can buy per piece of chocolate instead of being made to buy bulk. They also sell other local favorites like Hollywood Squares. I go and buy all my teacher gifts there as well! I could go on and on about how much I love this place!"}
