{"text":"Bleh.  Uninspired.  

Went to dine at Mechant Boeuf yesterday during the Happening Gourmand.  
Chose the goat cheese appy, Mechant Burger, and chocolate mousse for dessert.  

Nothing particularly good or bad.  
I would rate the food comparable to typical bar food.  

The bar is clearly the draw here ... might return for beverages but not to dine again."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night mid-April.
Arrived around 5:30 for an early drink.. sat at the bar, the place was empty.
Clientele was a mix between tourists and locals.. 
The place started to fill up around 6:30 and by 7:30 it was packed!

(++++)
- Decor is very cool.. definitely trendy. 
- Cool lounge like atmosphere, with live DJ
- Good cocktail selection
- Great deals on drinks and finger foods during 5 @ 7
- Tartar trio was good, best one being the tuna
- Fries were great!

(-------)

- We had to wait a long time for our simple burger food order

- The famous Méchant Burger is not that great. The beef patty is huge but way too salty!! I understand that it has bacon and bleu cheese on it but still.. Eventhough we waited a good 45 mins just for that, the burger was almost thrown on my plate.. 

- And the thing that bothered me the most about this place is that it seemed we were the only ones who didn't know the whole bar and wait staff. Therefore all around us, other customers were getting bottled water, bread, visits from the chef, the maitre d',  wait staff was ultra attentive to their needs,  ..etc.. While we were getting warm tap water, no bread, definitely felt weird.. It made for a very pretentious vibe..

Will I go back? Not sure.. if I do it'll be just for a quick drink before going somewhere else..

Cost: for 2, with 2 drinks each, before tax&tip: around 100$"}
{"text":"Found this lively restaurant on a wet Friday night while checking out the old port area.

Once we saw the funky DJ and heard the eclectic tracks he was laying down we knew this was our kind of place.

The food was unpretentious while still being good. I haven't had calamari as good as this in a long time.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm only basing this on apps and drinks, but it was good enough for me to consider returning. We walked in w/o a reservation, but it was early so had no problem getting a table for two. Their 5 - 7 specials are good: a large glass of wine for the price of a small, as well as beer and cocktail specials. The salmon tartare is AMAZING. The best I've ever had, and I'm a tartare whore. The bison is also excellent; the beef is ok."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice but food is not so good especially at $20+ a plate. I ordered the 3 sliders at $21 and they were super dry and bland tasting. The description on the menu sounded great but it lacked sauce and taste."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. Literally been waiting for an hour for our food. Never asked if we wanted drinks. Three tables near us have had problems with their meals and/or bills! Who is running this place?"}
{"text":"So I decided to check out this place after hearing a couple good things about it. It's in a nice location situated on St-Paul Ouest attatched to Hotel Nelligan. The ambiance is trendy with most of the people dressed in a business casual attire. 

A quick google search will show you that the interior is nicely lit wit warm coloured accents on the wall and a very modern decor overall.

The staff was very kind and served us very quickly, immediately clearing a table of two for me and my girlfriend as we walked in. The wait staff was very attentive and came multiple times to see if we were ready, so quick that I wasn't even able to get a good look at the menu haha. Great service overall.

Now the food, I ordered the mechant burger and my girlfriend got the vege burger. The two burgers were accompanied with the braised pork poutine. Unfortunately we were pretty disappointed with all three, my burger was on the dry side and many of the flavors did not really jump out leaving me with just the crunch from the bacon. As for my girlfriend the vege burger tasted more like warm bread than anything. With all the different ingredients in the vege burger much more was expected than the final taste you get from it. The poutine was pretty typical.

Nice place, gets loud at times, chairs are low (and I'm 6'2) also not the most comfortable had to stretch forward to much.

Would Possible give it another try but order something else on the menu.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Highly reco! Staff was super friendly and DJ music was surprisingly good. Ambience was more of a higher end bar than a club. Crowd was of varying ages.

We had the salmon and filet mignon both were fantastic! Their carpaccio was out app and that was yummy too!

All in all a great experience I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Such a great decor and vibe....that gets soiled by bad food. Had a steak that wasn't marinated evenly. Fries are served with Hellman's Mayonnaise...at this price is homemade mayonnaise too much to ask? 
Service was ok considering we were a large group but they didn't bother to offer us coffee or dessert. 
It's really too bad because this restaurant has everything to succeed but the menu needs a complete upgrade, and so does the food."}
{"text":"The food was very good and our server was  courteous and prompt.  It's expensive though.  The cocktail was ok, but not out-of-this-world for the price.  We also ordered water, and they had pitchers of it, but opened and charged us for a large bottle of normal water."}
{"text":"Toujours pendant le mois de septembre, avait lieu le Festival des Huîtres  regroupant trois restos membres d'Expérience Vieux-Montréal (Méchant Buf, Suite701 et Taverne Gaspar). Pendant cette période, les huîtres étaient simplement offertes à 2S l'unité et j'en ai profité pour organiser la fête d'un ami au Méchant Buf.

BOUFFE: Vu qu'on était plus de 12 personnes, c'est le menu de groupes (formule table d'hôte) qui s'appliquait à notre table. Je ne suis pas un fan des menus imposés/de groupes, mais je comprends que ça facilite la job en cuisine. Le problème avec celui de Méchant Buf est la disparité des prix dans les choix de plats principaux. Il fallait compter environ 40$ (entrée incluse) pour les côtes levées ou filet mignon. 

On a presque tous pris le Méchant Burger, mais bon, on était là pour les huîtres...et notre ami. 

En entrée, c'était la première fois que j'essayais des calmars préparés de cette façon là; moitié-frits, moitié-grillés. Délicieux et juste assez tendre.

Si vous allez au Méchant Buf, la poutine au porc braisé est un must. De bonnes frites et le porc effiloché avec sa sauce qui remplacent bien le gravy habituel. Mademoiselle a adorée la sienne.

Même s'il est relativement simple (buf 8oz, fromage gruyère, bacon et oignons caramélisés), le Méchant Burger (26$ en table d'hôte) est bon et surtout, de parfaite taille. +2 pour le pain et le fromage.

SERVICE/AMBIANCE : À peine une journée avant, j'ai du appeler pour faire passer la réservation de 8 à 18 personnes et ils ont été assez aimables de prendre la peine de remanier des tables pour nous fournir assez de places, merci encore! Même si l'attente entre les plats était relativement longue (grosse table, resto plein, on comprend), les serveurs étaient vraiment attentionnés du début à la fin et nous offraient même de commander des cocktails personnalisés. Avec un DJ et la clientèle 18-35 ans présents, c'est une ambiance animée et festive qui règne, idéale pour les 5 à 7 ou les groupes, un peu moins pour les dates. 

COOL: - Ambiance et décor. Aussi une bonne alternative à ses restos surs plus conventionnels d'Expérience Vieux-Montréal.
           - Service très courtois, même en gros groupe.
          - Menu de fin de soirée disponibles
        
BOFF : - Menu de groupe inégal"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hotel Nelligan next door and thought we would try this place out. Sadly, we were left disappointed.

Service
Agonizingly slow. 15 minutes to have waiter come take order for drinks/meal.  Another 20 minutes to receive drinks and bread and so on. 

Appetizers
Ceviche(14$) - consisted mainly of cubed shrimp. Decent flavor but would not order again
Tartar Sampler(14$) - three meats; tuna, salmon and beef. Well seasoned and the highlight to my meal

Entrées
Wife and I ordered medium-rare Merchant Burgers with Poutine(23$ each). Both burgers arrived well done. For a beef joint I would expect burgers to arrive medium-rare if ordered. Spoke to the waiter he said that it must be the lighting. Wrong. There should be a little red juice with my burger and pink center. This was bone dry. Sent it back only to get another identical well-done burger. In addition, my wife mentioned that the meat had a spoiled smell to it. It makes me wonder if they intentionally over cooked the burgers because meat was not fresh. . At least we did not end up with food poisoning! In all we ate about 2/3 of a single burger between us. Gave up and asked for check. Although the waiter had been extremely slow with service he offered to take one burger off order. 

All in all - we would never return."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner and to catch up with a friend around 10 and it was paaaaacked. It was also F1 weekend so it was to be expected. The first thing I noticed about this place was the wicked throwback music. I haven't heard Sisqo and 112 in the same set since I was an awkward high school kid trying to keep up the cool kids. 

Despite the sick tunes, it was also extremely loud. It felt like I was at the club trying to yell across the table. Not sure if it's always like this or because we showed up late for dinner and foolishly tried to have a sit-down meal. 

The food itself was great and served in very generous portions. Definitely a guy's kind of restaurant. I had the Mechant burger (served medium rare) and it was THICK and juicy. Definitely worth the price of admission. It was also served with a tangy and spicy sauce and a dump truck load of fries. 

My friend got the salmon and quinoa which also looked amazing. The ambience was really peppy and I could totally see this place as a good joint to grab a few friends, drink, talk, and dance like awkward teenagers! All within the coziness of the Old Port."}
{"text":"Mechant Boeuf is one of those resto-bars that will morph into whatever you like. If you're in jeans and a sweater, you can treat it as a place to get a tasty burger and chill. If you're in a suit, the decor gets outright glitzy near the bar and far wall so you feel like you're in a trendy supper club. On a date, with friends, whatever, Mechant Boeuf seems to fit the bill.

The service is typically average, and the food is actually really good - I've been a dozen times and always found it to be delicious, albeit not the most adventurous menu. In any case, I don't think the point was to experiment too much, just get the basics across (good burgers etc) without too much fuss in a beautiful setting. Works well!"}
{"text":"Been to Mechant Boeuf a few times for birthday celebrations, and for small gatherings.  So I have seen the service for both very large groups (25 people!?!) and for small (4 people).

The place is always packed, so its important to call ahead.

The service has been mostly adequate with a couple mishaps that weren't too obtrusive to the overall dining experience.

The food is not bad...I have always gotten the Mechant Burger (hope you like gruyere) when I go and it usually doesn't disappoint.

The atmosphere is very trendy and the crowd usually reflects that.  There is a DJ who plays an eclectic mix of music (he is sporting a gigantic beard now).


It's a great place to celebrate something or to have a romantic meal."}
{"text":"Bad brunch experience! Food not as tasty as the menu looks. I left the restaurant and had to go to another restaurant to be satisfied as my plate was so small. I complained to the server, and she invented a story that did not fit with reality! Also, loud music, so we had to yell at each other. Definitely, there are way better places in Montreal to eat out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived without reservations on a busy night last week and were seated promptly in the bar, which was fine because it is a nice open area. The music was great ( 70s, 80s, 90s hits) and we glanced around to see a wide mix of young professionals and even couples with infants. We are in our 60s but could tell we'd would enjoy the vibe. 
In the hands of our gorgeous waitress/bartender (a statuesque brunette), we started with drinks and impeccable  fresh oysters, continued with a fresh and ample caeser salad with perfectly grilled shrimp and ended with a foie gras platter, sharing everything along the way. Our waitress dazzled us with her friendly professional manner and generosity. If anyone had told us we would wind up doing vodka shots with her by the end of the evening, I would not have believed them, but somehow it happened. This unexpected night at an unassuming place just down the street from our hotel turned out to be one of the happiest we had on our weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Thank you, Merchant Boeuf Bar!"}
{"text":"Very few piece of cold bread took a long time to arrive at the table.. good appetizer... main (veal and cod) can't be praise... alright dessert. Won't recommend."}
{"text":"Merchant Boeuf is a fun place with good cocktails and a mix of good live music or dj's. I always have a fun time here, unfortunately the food is really inconsistent. Have eaten there three times - first time good, second time bad, third time average. It is also slightly overpriced, but so are many places in the neighborhood.

I am torn on this place though because I really do like the atmosphere, music, staff and cocktails. Go for a good 5 a 7, stay for some music, and if you need something to nibble on go for a noncommittal appetizer and save dinner for later. 

One recommendation would be the tartare sampler which I actually liked. Stay away from the raw bar.... not a disaster, just not at all tasty."}
{"text":"So, we made reservations on Saturday night for 16 people to celebrate a birthday, and were told that we could only choose from a group menu. That I understand! 
We had a 21:30 reservation and got our main meal nearly 2 hours later. The service was very slow, the place was packed yet the food was just okay. 3 people ordered the burgers and were disappointed with flavor and size, my husband had the salmon and then the beef tartar and both were very bland. I ordered the seafood platter, the oysters were good, the shrimp were alright but my crab legs had been dipped in some kind of ammonia concoction, they were very pasty and smelled really bad. From my understanding, the food industry will sometimes \"bathe\" meats or fish when they need to prolong the shelf life and believe me, it didn't smell like anything close to the ocean! Very disappointing on a $45 dish. The men were also disappointed with the portion sizes which could have been acceptable if the flavors would have been accentuated, everything was simply okay but not better. We will not be returning to the Mechant Boeuf!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Excellent food. Excellent service. Fun atmosphere. Highly recommend. We dined with our children, 12 and 14. Perfectly acceptable."}
{"text":"We were seated and then literally could not speak to each other without mouth to ear.  The noisiest restaurant I have ever experienced.  We left before ordering.  Get a clue: people need to talk to each other at restaurants."}
{"text":"Fantastique!!! Brunch au méchant boeuf était malade cette après midi. Yanni notre serveur nous a suggeré le boozy brunch, mimosa a volonté !!!
Service et atmosphère incroyable.
Je conseille fortement le brunch et demandez yanni !"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing poutine!!  The vibe was overly trendy and posh, even for a girl from NYC.  Food and drinks were excellent, decent service.  Be sure to make a reservation, as the host/hostess assured us there was no available seating without one."}
{"text":"I saw some other reviews so I decided to visit. It was an amazing choice! The atmosphere was very lively and the place was filled by 7pm. Our waiter was very attentive and never let our water run out. We ordered the crispy fried shrimp as an appetizer (It was perfectly crunchy and tasted amazing). And then we got the Pork Ribs (decently cooked, a good choice is to substitute the normal fries for poutine charlevoix. it tasted amazing). And also the Méchant Chicken. (WARNING it is a huge whole chicken on a stake. I didn't know about this before I ordered so we were surprised when it came. It tasted okay though) I think the best was the shrimp and the poutine. !"}
{"text":"DON'T FORGET TO MAKE A RESERVATION! 
Oysters, beef tartar, shrimp ceviche, a dirty martini and an awesome/eccentric dj! I don't normally eat in old Montreal but this place has a great local vibe. Food was really amazing, and I had force myself to eat slowly so I could enjoy it longer!"}
{"text":"My review needs to be read when considering the conditions. I was here on New Year's Eve, along with about 14 others, as part of a large-party reservation. As a result we had a limited menu, and the music was very loud - but both of those were to be expected, considering the time and the night.

I'll start with service, because it's nearest and dearest to my heart as a life-long server. Service was great, bordering on wonderful, considering the challenge of our table. The orders were taken when we wanted and the drinks were always full. When my brother tried (twice!) without success to get a beer he wanted from the server - the first time the keg was dry, the second time the server recommended one he didn't like - she apologized with a round of shots for the entire table! Woah! Very impressive! A couple of minor mods were missed (eg: burger came with mustard that was asked to be excluded) but nothing heart-breaking.

The food itself was quite good, but not worth the price tag of $60.00 for the fixed price table d'hote. Again, I understand that since it's NYE there's a certain premium to be paid. That said, the only part of the meal that was full-value was the appetizer. The foie gras was divine. The burger I had was ok - nothing I'll remember, sadly. It was a bit on the small side, and the fries that came with were nothing special... just fries. And the dessert - a stack of three macaroons - was WAY too sweet. I can't imagine most people enjoying it unless they had a career as Willy Wonka's tester in their back pocket.

Ultimately, the price felt high for the food that we received, and while the food wasn't bad - it was probably overpriced by a fair bit, even recognizing the unique circumstances of the night.

All said, I probably wouldn't come back - but I also wouldn't slag it seriously to a friend. It's about as evenly neutral a memory as one can have."}
{"text":"This place is chic. My sister, brother, husband and I dined here on Sunday night -- the last night we were in town. We needed a good steak dinner to cap off a great trip. I left the baby with my parents and we were set to have an adult evening.

No reservations necessary. We saw on OpenTable that all times were available and we decided to wing it, not knowing when we were going to eat and also to see what else was around Old Montreal.

We looked in and it was pretty empty around 7. We walked around and decided this was our best option in the area without a wait for meat-meat-meat. We had been to the hotel and adjoining restaurant previously (years ago) for a wedding and loved the atmosphere. They haven't changed the décor much, if at all.

I ordered the Mechant Burger, my sister and husband both ordered the steak frites (hanger steak) and my big brother had the rib steak (rib eye).

To start, we had the charcuterie board with the foie gras (my sister's requirement). It was a good portion. Some of the meats were spicy and my hubby polished off the dozen olives and pickled goodies. My burger was fantastic and came with double-fried frites and mayo. 

Sampling the other meals, the hanger steak was as expected. The accompanying veggies were undercooked---I can handle raw carrots, green beans and tomatoes, but not Brussels sprouts! Obviously we all preferred the rib steak to the hanger steak cut, but it's huge at 20 oz. Shamefully we left a lot of food on the table and had to pass on dessert.

Service was courteous. Not memorable, but that's a good thing. This place is a solid OK."}
{"text":"After a full day of driving and some afternoon stroll we were recommended by our Airbnb host to try Méchant Buf. The hostess at the restaurant ask if we wanted Bar for $1 oyster and she had me at $1. Ordered half dozen oyster, chicken burger, and poutine. Oyster were delicious, full of flavour for $1, it was a steal! Overheard that the oyster served was from New Brunswick. Chicken burger with a side of fries was very good! the chicken was well cooked and juicy and well complimented with crispy bacon & veg. The star entree was the poutine! the braised pork was amazing with green onion and the gravy and melted curd cheese was a perfect match!!

For sure I would come here again! Bartender and hostess was very accommodating and always had a smile! :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks at this cool place.  the setting is in old montreal but far away from the tourist traps that line the cobblestone street by the river.  The bar is red and glows while a resident DJ spins ambient techno. The vibe is sexy without stuffiness.  The food is very good. After 11 pm, there is a late night menu. For 23$ CAD, you can get 2 cutting boards full of BBQ ribs, beef brisket, and chicken breast. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Salt, salt, my kingdom for some salt. Is this a contest to see how damn bland you can make a meal? Then we had to ask the waiter for salt and apparently he disappeared as he hunted down for the elusive salt that the chef apparently won't use. The fries were awful, greasy and a mess and the onion soup must have been flavoured with bitters."}
{"text":"I've just arrived for my first trip to Montreal from new York city and I must say, this place did not leave a great taste in my mouth for my first night.... Literally and figuratively.
The food is over priced for the taste, everything was very bland. Calamari got the second star for this review though. 
When first seated we waited a very long time for service and actually we felt very ignored.... the man with water walked past us twice without pouring us any even after I made eye contact and smiled. I got up and got our water for the first pour. Yeah I know, pushy American right? I've just gotten off a 11 hour train ride, Gimmie water! 
After finishing we waited another very long while to be checked on and get a box to go. 
The staff was very friendly when they could be found however. 
All in all just eh."}
{"text":"Walked in and it looks very good and atmosphere is very good. Waiters were nice but service took longer than expected. Food was okay portions however the taste was plain and needs work. Got a burger and it was slightly burnt, fries were too soft, except that could be just preference. My partner got a steak it was supposed to be medium, however came out very red. Overall i give it 3 stars for the staff and atmosphere yet like i said needs some work on the food."}
{"text":"Mm mm mmm!! This place is awesome! I've been hearing about Mechant Boeuf for years now, and finally made reservations last Friday for the hub and I. After reading many mixed reviews, I prepared my mind to expect sub-par service, however this couldn't have been further from the truth. 

Upon arriving, we checked our coats in (free), and were led to our table near the front window. Cool music and red dim lights definitely set the vibe for a modern and funky night ahead of us. Our hostess was very nice and was there within minutes to take our drink order. Soon thereafter, we received our drinks which were super strong and quite large, and placed our food order. We both went for different cuts of steak with the crispy shrimp to share as an appetizer.

The presentation of the shrimp was great (sort of like lollipops that stuck out of a board) and the taste was even better with and without the honey garlic sauce on the side. Then came another round of different drinks which were just as good as the first, and finally our main dishes. 

It's funny, but many places are capable of messing up simple steak and potatoes, but those places most definitely do not include Mechant Boeuf.  My sirloin was immpecably cooked, super tender, and full of flavor. Not to mention the phenomenal cheesy mashed potatoes that came on the side. The hub also loved his steak, and his fries were super yummy (of course I had to steal a few...ok maybe 10...:p).

All in all a great experience for a super fair price. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Dissapointed with the portion sizes. Pretentious! Meet wasn't tender. 
Nice place, DJ, and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Le staff était pressé de nous voir partir avant même de démarrer... on nous a dit qu'on aurait la table 2.30h et pas plus.
Nous y étions pour le Happening Gourmand, une bonne occasion de montrer son savoir-faire a des nouveaux clients qui voudront ptet revenir une autre fois... et nous avons senti le stress des serveurs, la nourriture ok sans plus, saumon en croûte tout sec, certainement que la cuisine était au max de sa capacité en ce samedi soir.
C'est dommage."}
{"text":"J'aime ce resto pour une constance dans sa nourriture, le décor, les gammes de prix qui peuvent convenir à tous les budgets (du Burger au steaks avec extras) et sa proximités des bars intéressants pour les 5@7. Très bon service... Mon 3 étoiles vient du fait que mon repas était \"correct\" sans plus. J'ai pris la soupe à l'oignon et le fromage gouait le frigidaire et le Burger était peu copieux pour le prix. Par contre, le reste de la famille à pris les steak et ils ont tous adoré leur cuisson, et dieu sait que mon père est TRÈS difficile en la matière!"}
{"text":"Went there this evening with coworkers for dinner. Establishment was not too busy as we arrived and we were promptly seated in an area of our choosing (not immediately next to the live music, which from where we were seated was actually pretty pleasant). 

Service was prompt and courteous throughout the evening, the drink orders were fulfilled quickly and without issue and the food came out fairly quickly as well. A bison tartare was shared as an appetizer which was tasty. I had the salmon with green beans and quinoa which was very enjoyable and not overly pricey either. 

Overall, a good experience that I would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for Bottomless Brunch,  and i am happy to say that this is the best bottomless in Montreal after having done every one in the city. The service is SUPER fast (Thanks Joel! We love you) and they leave you the bottles on the table so you can serve yourself. The brunch menu is extensive and has something for everyone.

Additionally, i've been here for dinner and happy hour and its also been great with good prices. Would highly recommend! 


Pictured below is the goat cheese toast."}
{"text":"Good. Food was fine. Beer was fine. Music really loud at the dinner hour. 

Service was exceptional. The service alone is 6 stars out of 5. Solid final meal in Montreal."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. It's a huge restaurant, good for groups. However, it was very empty for brunch time. I got a bagel with smoked salmon and bernaise sauce ($16). It only came with the bottom half of a bagel which surprised me for the price. The sauce and bagel were cold, seemed like our food had been sitting out for a while before it was served to us. All of the food we got was actually cold. I saw someone else receive the same smoked salmon dish that I ordered however hers was served with 2 large hash-browns, which mine didn't come with. When I asked the server about it he verified that it should have come with hash browns. To rectify the mistake he slammed a dessert menu down on the table and offered dessert. I declined and he dropped off the check with charges for both meals, juice, and coffee. At this point he was being very rude. I've worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years and I couldn't imagine charging someone full price for something they did not receive. And to top it off he was giving me an attitude like I was trying to scam him. I would never go back here again for an over-priced cold brunch. Head over to Olive et Gourmand right up the street and you'll see why the place is packed all the time."}
{"text":"Was on a business trip and dined solo at the bar, service was friendly and prompt. Had the entree steak tartar and swapped my fries for poutine, because.. well, poutine. :) The tartar was well seasoned and fresh, the mixed green salad quelled my guilt and the poutine was decadent. Great vibe with live music and a good assortment of entrees and apps at different sizes to suit your appetite. 

Also well situated in old port, just behind notre dame cathedral and part of the Nelligan hotel."}
{"text":"I've been to Mechant Boeuf a few times, and it really depends on what you go there for that makes or breaks your night. 

If you go there for predrinks with a few friends and perhaps a small bite to eat, you'll be good. Being a packed and loud place, it's not so good for first dates or any type of meetup that would require much conversation. The atmosphere is very trendy and the restaurant is often full, so make a reservation beforehand. 

As for the food, I've enjoyed their crab cakes, fried calamari MB style, and stack of goat cheese and roasted beets. However, when I tried their beef hanger, I wasn't very satisfied, I found it was a bit chewy and had to be cut into small pieces so I wouldn't choke... still ate it, but 'meh' would truly capture my lack of excitement over it. I'd be really interested in sharing their roasted chicken on a beer can next time I go, it's a great spin on chicken that I have never seen elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was around 10:30 pm on a cold December night we were looking for a place to eat in Old Montreal. It being a Wednesday night - most places were closed. Connected to the Hotel Nelligan on Rue St Paul, this bar/restaurant was a last minute effort to satisfy our hunger pangs. 

We weren't sure what to expect - but we enjoyed our late night snack here. Atmosphere was nice - they had a pair of acoustic guitarists covering well known American songs. It was nice to have the background music. 

Though the carried burgers and steaks, we had already eaten dinner earlier so we decided to share four appetizers. We totally ordered too much. The portions are large! 

The calamari was tender and the sauce was nice. The outside breading was soft but we prefer ours a little more crispy. It was accompanied by a small salad in the same basket. 


The mini burgers (2) were well seasoned and the bun was buttery and crispy. It too was accompanied by a small medley of greens. Tasty!

The French Onion soup was huge. I was expecting a small cup but received a medium sized bowl. The flavors were nice and the cheese was baked perfectly on top. It leaned a little saltier than I like it but overall it was enjoyable. 

My highlight was the Charlevoix Poutine with braised pork. It was well put together. The fries were crispy.. The gravy and the braised pork complimented the cheese curds well. It was my first taste of Poutine so I don't have anything else to compare it to. However, I would certainly have it again!

The service was nice too. We walked in and were seated right away. Our waiter was very friendly and stopped to check on us throughout our late night meal. Nice place to enjoy a few drinks and watch people on the street."}
{"text":"Four of us went for dinner prior to a Centaur theatre evening, looking forward to a nice casual dinner but we were all quite disappointed. 
Our salmon tartar appetizer was mediocre, with the salmon chopped so fine it was difficult to really tell what it was. The accompanying croutons were too hard and the salad too wilted.
Our burgers were much too over cooked which resulted in a hard dry patty, but the bun was fresh and tasty. The accompanying fries were plentiful and good, but those of us who upgraded to the Poutine were disappointed once again. Small portion, with bland sauce, very little cheese and pulled pork. Will not be going again."}
{"text":"Service is superb, food was amazing and price is reasonable. 
Was referred by a friend and decided to check out this place when visiting the area.  We were disappointed.
Enjoyed very much the seafood platters, perfect for sharing.  Must try to beer canned chicken!!"}
{"text":"Very good poutine and burger.  My boyfriend and I had the Mechant Burger and boy were we glad we did.  Hefty and full of flavour with a side of poutine with pulled pork and melted curds.  It was overkill and I saw my boyfriend weave in his chair a bit from eating too much.  The burger patty was packed with meat but it still held its shape throughout the meal.  As for the vibe it was a bit crowded and the servers were a little overworked but they were as attentive as they can be.  They had a DJ spinning but the tunes were good for a sexy meal on Saturday night.  Will come back here again for drinks at the bar and get gussied up to stay and enjoy the evening crowd.  But we were happy to drink our wine and pat our full stomachs back to the hotel."}
{"text":"Location: In the Old Port on St. Paul Ouest, right across from Dolcetto. Subway: Place d'Armes. If you drive in - good luck finding parking. 

Service: Pretty darn good! Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by the host and offered a mandatory, but free coat check (that's a rarity). There was no fuss in getting a table on the bar side of this small resto-bar. I had barely sat down when the bartender appeared before me ready to take my order (again, a rarity!). Since my date was occupied, I asked the friendly bartender turned waiter, to come back since I didn't know what said date wanted to drink. A waitress took his place a few minutes later and wasted no time in taking our order. That said, she wasn't overly friendly and I felt a little attitude. Meh. That said, throughout the evening, wait staff frequently checked in on us, and the manager stopped by to say hello. I was rather impressed with all of this attention!

Decor/People/Vibe: Pretty cool. Lots of red, dim lighting and a waterfall wall at the back. The vibe was good, though it's a pretty young crowd. For those of you who have issues with hipsters, there seemed to be a hipster convention when I was there so be warned! It was very loud, so not the ideal place if you're looking to have a conversation or go on a first date. There's a DJ from Thursday to Saturday, and I really liked his set - mainly electronic.

I didn't eat there so can't comment on the food other than to say that what I saw pass by didn't look too impressive. I'll have to try it out and update my review at a later date."}
{"text":"Food selection was great.  Wife says it's the best salad she's had in a long time. That's what she had for dinner.  I had the caesar salad and the Beer/Onion Soup.  I forgot I'm not a big fan of the \"French Onion\" soup, but I ate it all.  You get a basket of bread.  Beer selection is okay.  Nothin' too fancy here. Service was good.  It's kind of loud.  I thought they had some unique selections (corn dog with a sausage instead of hot dog - my daughter said it was good). Nice visual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great service, local beers, and burgers. Skip the Skinny Burger and splurge on the real deal - the Mechant burger was superior!"}
{"text":"Came to méchant buf on Friday night. We sat at the bar and was served by Stephanie and Ian. Had a great time, they told me all about the new cocktail list and wine list. I had the crispy shrimp and the tuna poke. Great service great food and music. Thanks guys I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not astounding, but then again, not bad.  I had heard that the sliders and poutine were pretty great, and they were.  The sliders were probably the best thing we tried - great flavor to the beef and tasty accompaniments on the plate.  Second best thing was the poutine, and it was rich and delicious although I could feel my arteries clogging moment by moment.  The third item we tried was the tartare trio, and it was definitely underwhelming.  On the plate were three small servings of tuna, salmon, and beef tartare.  The only one with a really good flavor was (surprise) the beef.  Both the tuna and the salmon were overwhelmed by green onions and what I could taste of the fish wasn't that great.  2 out of 3 isn't bad, and the restaurant itself has a fun vibe and great decor, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and dancing with my mom on our first night in Montreal (a Thursday night, which seems to be the big night for this place). We arrived late in the evening and had a reservation for 10:30 PM. While the food and service was delicious (we shared the ceasar salad and hanger steak- the portions are huge!), our favorite part about this spot was the DJ playing awesome tunes and the dancing. Between 11 and midnight it turns into a huge dance party to oldies tunes mixed with today's hits. If you are looking for a delicious meal and a fun dance party on a Thursday night, I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So I'm visiting Montreal from the great state of New Jersey and I'm naturally looking for a great boozy brunch, I came across mechanical boeuf online and was intrigued by their $32 bottomless brunch. The $32 is in addition to whatever the price of the entree so keep that in mind but definitely definitely go! The food is delicious and the portions are generous, they serve you mimosas until you ask for your check so you can absolutely get your money's worth. Our waiter was Joel, a native to Montreal and an absolute gem. Please ask for him if you go, provided great insight on bars to attend and local attractions."}
{"text":"A dinner out with some of the Sales Execs led us to Mechant boeuf ... amid the myriad of restaurants we are making our way through during each business visit to Montreal.  The atmosphere is inviting, nice color scheme and the water wall feature is relaxing even through the many conversations tableside as well as the bar in this eclectic restaurant.

Our evening began with libations, of course, from Lychee martini to Argentinian wine to a standard Cosmo.  Appetizer split between the four of us was the Tasting Tartar which included beef, salmon and tuna.  Very large portions, so glad we were all consuming this offering...served with crustini and a spicy ponzu style sauce.

Dinner - we ended up with identical orders - NY Strip set on a bed of creamy cheese potatoes and crowned with an onion and bacon topping.  The side was a mix of summer squash and zucchini simply sauted.  

The meat was not as tender as I would have liked and there was certainly some fatty stuff on the sides that could have been trimmed prior to service.  The potatoes were ok, although a bit too creamy to support the meat as a platform.  The veggies were bland.

Dessert - a decadent chocolate cake with a very rich icing...not house made but a nice way to end the meal.

What I found interesting on the menu was \"Beer Can Chicken\"....hmmm, not a BBQ joint, not a Roadhouse, and certainly not located in rural VA, so why I ask you would that appear on a menu with tartar, assorted cuts of steak and nice shrimp offerings???

Can't say it would be a regular place for me, especially since there are so many more choices of eateries we have yet to try!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Really close to my place and the seafood was amazing, went there with my best friend and we enjoyed the seafood platter and the salad, hope I will try the cream brûlée next time."}
{"text":"Perfect date spot! This place has it all! Live music, friendly staff, and super delicious food.

My girlfriend and I ordered the Jack Daniels braised BBQ ribs and a few cocktails and slowly ate our meal while watching a live rock duo. The ribs were perfect and fell right off the bone, and the Jack Daniels sauce made them super tender and delicious. The drinks were great, but I felt like they were over priced. The staff was super attentive and made our date night perfect. The manager even offered us a free desert and helped us find the perfect jazz club to go afterwards. How often do you find such a helpful place that they point you towards other establishments? Definitely worth the long wait to get a table!"}
{"text":"The settingThe food was ok.  For a place with beef in the name, I expected a better steak. and the calamari entree was, again, just ok.  For the old port, I guess its reasonably priced, and the service was really good.  just wish the food was a bit better.  

I would go back for drinks, which they have a pretty good selection of local beers, and good wines, and maybe a quick bite, not for a full blown dinner."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat before going out.
My favorite after trying everything on the menu : The 16oz contre filet with the fois gras sauce. Amazing."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place for dinner and we don't regret it. She had the onglet steak and I had the grilled salmon. Both of them were amazing and we couldn't have asked for a better dinner. They also gave us some warm bread and butter which was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere with a nice band playing English songs when we were there. Food was delicious. Had pulled pork sandwich which was juicy although a bit low on seasoning but overall a great meal. Salmon on a bed of quinoa was extremely good. Service was friendly and efficient. Would definitely come back here when in the area."}
{"text":"By far the best meal I ever had! Perfect food and really nice service. It's a bit expensive, but worth the price."}
{"text":"This rating is based on the bar scene only- the décor is sexy and vibrant. They have a great happy hour here where you can indulge in high end liquor and unique cocktails. The staff is very friendly, in true French Canadian fashion, and was eager to create us cocktails, give us information on the hot spots in the city and converse with us about restaurants nearby. 
Our bartender created me an off the menu cocktail which was absolutely wonderful; the attention to detail was unmatchable. The DJ had a great mix of music and the place wasn't insanely packed so you could easily get a drink. We actually were able to sit at the bar on both Friday and Saturday. Price points are a bit high for cocktails, but they are high end, so what do you expect?
When I return to Montreal, this is the first place I will post up for a nice drink and break from the endless amounts of walking throughout the old city."}
{"text":"Pricey. Average steak, linguine and calamari. Less than average ceasar salad. 2 stars only good for ambiance. C
Soft drink $4. Very expensive for a cup of ice and 3 sips of drink."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner (couple of 2) because we were told that this area had plenty of restaurants to choose from and it was in Old Montreal. In the freezing cold this was the third option. For starters they make you check your coat at the door before entering, and once inside it is a multitude of small boutique tables and a full dinning room. This was on Friday night so we thought it would be busy. The service was mediocre and lacked personality. Was not rushed by any means but felt awkward by waiting twenty minutes for a small cocktail shrimp entrée and what should have been one hr dinner lasted about two and a half. The waiter had far too many tables than he could handle. Never the less when the bill came we were very surprised by the amount, taxes were outrageous and when asked if we would like to tip the waiter added the percentage of the tip on top of the taxes, making our dinner overpriced and a little waste of time. The venue is sexy and well styled. There was DJ playing house music, and a sushi bar, which added creativity. The food was better than good but not great. Fifteen dollar veggie burger and five dollar dime amount of ice cream will have you re thinking why you went in there in the first place.

If you go here I recommend letting the server know just how long that you plan to stay, if you are on a time restraint, knowing that there are really no booths, only boutique tables, paying for a meal that is good but not great, and lastly tipping in cash."}
{"text":"We went there because of Happening Gourmand event. Had the brunch for 17$ each. I really enjoyed my experience. The place was big, had a DJ, lots of people during the brunch. We had an entree and the meal. Even though the food was a bit too saucy for us.. it was still delicious and new for us."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I took our first trip to Montreal and this restaurant made our trip!! The food is amazing (especially the seafood platter), the ambiance was perfect  and the bartender Nikki along with her manager Seth went above and beyond in service.  Loved it here!"}
{"text":"We arrived in Montreal on a Thursday night and by the time we arrived at the hotel, checked in, and drop our bags, most of the restaurant kitchens were closing. Thank goodness there was Mechant Boeuf. We called ahead and were told that their kitchen was still open. We arrived and seated ourselves right away at the bar. There wasn't anyone in the dining room but there were a couple of people hanging out at the bar. The DJ was still actively spinning music.

The bartender was great and did not at all rush us so we were still able to enjoy our cocktails with the food. It was late and we just wanted cocktails and food. Granted, we didn't know what to expect and the best part was that we thoroughly enjoyed the food. Steak tartare and salmon tartare are my one of favorite foods ever so I've had my fair of this and am able to draw comparisons. Both of these items had great flavor. The poutine with braised pork was also quite a delight."}
{"text":"I'll admit that my expectations were low when we walked in. By the time I walked out, though, I was pretty impressed. 

I ordered the \"Burger Flight,\" which consisted of three cute little sliders that were accompanied with separate condiments of thousand island dressing and caramelized onions. The buns, which tasted brioche-y, were nicely toasted. The meat was a little bit dry, but it wasn't too bad. I have a little problem with their calling it a \"flight,\" though, because I think of flights as being an assortment. It would be a flight if each of the three burgers were different. But, whatever -- to-MAY-to, to-MAH-to.

I also ordered a side of poutine -- my first on this visit to Montreal, and I thought it was fantastic (especially the braised pork on top -- wow!!), barring one weakness: the cheese curds were really big, and some hadn't fully melted. Thus, it was hard to get a good ratio of gravy-potato-cheese-pork. Granted, my poutine experience is quite thin, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. ;)

My husband ordered the sea bass, which I thought was going to be awful -- I mean, the place is called Mechant Boeuf, not Mechant Poisson. ;) However, the fish came out cooked PERFECTLY: moist, with nice, crispy skin. The accompanying fingerling potatoes were nice and buttery, with a touch of mustard. Yum.

Con 1: LOUD music. It was an acoustic band that was playing on the Wednesday night we went, but my husband and I practically had to yell across the table in order to have a conversation. Not pleasant. 

Con 2: Service was spotty. It took about 15 minutes for a server to come over and take our order after we were seated; we were seriously considering walking out when the server finally arrived. Glasses were never refilled. i'd actually rate this place 3.5 stars due to the service, but since Yelp doesn't allow half stars, I'm rounding up.

Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"More like Mechant-douche! A bunch of holier-than-thou yuppies who masquerade under the pretense of \"cool.\" Get your dark rimmed Michael Kors spectacles, davidoff cologne, skinny Levi's, Kenneth Coles and pop a fresh one!"}
{"text":"I had the pork ribs.  It was ok.  It was cooked well, the flavor wasn't amazing and the sauce was an interesting bbq and whiskey flavor.  Enough said.  I'm sure there's better restaurants around.   The wait was fast but the food took forever to come out."}
{"text":"Sunday night 7:00pm, the place was busy but we were able to secure a table for two without a reservation. Very loud and dark.  French onion soup, crab cakes, and poutine were excellent. Couldn't order a rare burger. They only do medium well...no explanation as to why...somewhat surprised as this is a steakhouse. Burger was dry. Main course scallop entree came with only 4 scallops. Very pricey. Too many other options in Montreal--not going back."}
{"text":"Our Via train from Toronto to Montreal arrived an hour late due to the train staff's failure to close a door at one of the stops. As a result, we arrived in Montreal at 11PM thirsting for some alcoholic beverages, and maybe a bite to eat. 
After quickly dropping off our luggage and cleaning up, we walked down to Old Montreal to find the perfect place. It took us about 20 minutes of either places closing up shop for the night or simply tacky tourist dives serving nachos before we found the Merchant. It was crowded at midnight and still serving.
Service was a bit slow as we were adjacent to a large birthday group that was just breaking up and asking for separate bills (another conversation entirely!). The host realized the problem and began taking care of us; we had sparkling water quickly and a bottle of red soon after that. We decided to share the beef carpaccio and Cesaer salad appetizer, and it was delicuous. All the food we saw looked delicious, it's a fun rowdy atmosphere, and the DJ was playing great \"old\" music from the early 90s. 
We liked it so much we returned the next night for drinks after the Killers concert. This place is popular and I can see why."}
{"text":"This place is a great example of what a trendy old Montreal bar should be. 

Packed with lawyers, artists, and IT professionals, the menu is more upscale than a normal bar yet are the only place I know that does beer can chicken. 

If you have an out of town visitor or client wanting an Old Montreal experience, this is a great place for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here...great surroundings, good service and great food.  I had a shortrib plate with mashed potatoes and everything was very good.  The beef was tender and full of flavor and the potatoes were rich and buttery.

This place is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat good steak and have a drink ! The terrace is super cool and the waiters are doing a great work. Shout out to Joel, the asian guy, who's funny and super attentive. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Adjacent and connected to our hotel (nelligan) and has a nice ambience in the evening.   Unfortunately, we had just arrived, checked in, and tired as hell so strolling in at 10pm for our first bite in Montreal was lacking in energy on our part...however, we were still hoping for a decent inauguration of our playtime here in this city so was expecting a decent meal.  

My guess is people come here more for the ambience rather than anything else.  

First impression:

Snobby. 
Sushi smell, although this was not a sushi restaurant. Must have come from the raw bar.  
Pretty empty, but it did pick up a little bit later near 11. 
DJ spinning, but seemed to have ended just as we came in.
My guess is this place could get hoppin' on the right weekend nights.

On to the food. 

Crab cakes
Slider trio 
Glass of wine
Apple martini
Salad garden

Crab cakes were TINY.  2 pieces the size of silver dollars.  I make my own crab cakes at home and know when you use the cheap meat v the lumpy good ones...AND I know when you it's over fried.  Not impressed.

Hubby's trio of sliders were left nibbled at best.  He gave me the salmon one to try and I couldn't even get a quarter of the way thru because it was beyond dry, tasteless and just plain sad.  He left the other two because it was equally as sad, but the poutine side was its savior. Pulled pork garnished the plate of fried gravy goodness which made it more gourmet than anything.  Hands down the best dish we had, but evenly Montreal standards, the poutine was not exceptional.  It was slightly above average at best.

3 stars for the ambience, vibe..."}
{"text":"Went here twice as we were staying in the area.  Once for dinner and second for yummy $1 oysters (hint: they're not crap oysters!  Same as what they have for dinner) and $5 beers.  

For dinner we had the Kobe mini burgers, salads and braised beef poutine.  It was nummy indeed.  My partner had cerviche and a Caesar. All lovely. 

The hostess and waitress were pitch perfect and during \"happy hour\" the bar poured a loose drink and was tres friendly.  

I recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent. We had hamburger sliders which were awesome.  Chicken sandwich was great and huge. Hanger steak was excellent.  Staff was very friendly and responsive. Relaxed pace: were not rushed. The. Lassie rock guitarists were an unexpected bonus.  Four thumbs up from my wife and I"}
{"text":"Cool vibe at this Old Port spot specializing in beef. An eclectic DJ spins 80s-ish tracks.

The oysters were some of the best I've had in a while, nice and briney. The carpaccio was fine, served with a tasty ceasar salad.

The signature burger is wet aged for 30 days and had a slight cured taste. I didn't like the soft bun though. 

The poutine was awesome! The gravy makes this dish and theirs was spot on."}
{"text":"Great food! We found this restaurant after visiting a few sidewalk menus. The space was intriguing and a little funky. Totally loved the Tropical Sangria! It was like a party in a glass. I had the Calamari, which was yummy. It had a little kick in the breading, just the right amount to enhance the dish, but not be too spicy. I also enjoyed the Nicoise salad. The tuna melted like butter in your mouth. The others I dined with had the Scallops, and the ribs. They said the ribs were amazing, the scallops were great, but the Lentils that came with the Scallops were hard and tasteless. I would visit again just for the Nicoise Salad. It was super duper!"}
{"text":"Deliciosa la comida, el ambiente muy agradable con música en vivo, que hacen del lugar un espacio para almorzar o cenar en cualquier momento del viaje, súper bien ubicado en old Montreal, cerca a todo lo interesante de la ciudad, con precios razonables de acuerdo a lo recibido, recomendado, no dejen de venir."}
{"text":"Astomosphere was great. Staff was very friendly. We ordered ywo rounds of oysrer withiut knowing the Happy Hour has passed already. Lol. Their Haopy Hour is from 5 pm to 7 pm btw. I saw a review om Yelp complementing their Chicken burger and I ordered it and it was indeeed very juicy and tasty."}
{"text":"Again only 4 stars cuz i havent tried the food yet but excellent martini lychées!! Excellent service...super chill ambiance despite being a bit more on the chic side...apparently they have a roof terrace so totally coming back here later in the summer to take advantage of that!"}
{"text":"Joelle served us. Yong, nice guy wanted to give his best shot but wasn't as professional as we expected. He was kind of lost. The food was not good as we expected. I would never go back to this place again. There's  definitely better options on St. Paul. 6/10"}
{"text":"Such a vibrant scene! We were looking for an upscale meal in Old Town, and our concierge recommended Mechant Boeuf. After cabbing it to the restaurant, we checked in our reservation and got a great table.

We started with some of the best calamari I've ever had. We also had the fried chicken and a Caesar salad. Everything was really delicious.

In terms of wine, we got reds--V Kim Crawford and V. Parfait. So good we had it twice! 

Overall a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Burger was good only way they cook it is medium well which didn't allow you to really get the flavor of the meat. If you go after 5pm thursday - sunday they have a DJ which plays techno music which can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for. Was an experience but I would say this is a great place for burgers."}
{"text":"Been twice so far, service is great but food is just good. There is always something missing in the meal  - breakfast poutine had broth rather than gravy and so was rather bland, brisket had nothing to offset the heaviness of it, eggs were undercooked. Wouldn't send anything back but there are better places in the area for the price."}
{"text":"I came here after doing my engagement shoot to have some lovely dinner in Montreal after :) We ordered their braised pork poutine and their foie gras with charcuterie platter. The portions were quite generous! Both of us were already halfway full after we shared the poutine - and those cheese curds yummmm. went beautifully with the braised pork. Our server was also very nice, they seated us by the window which was a cozy spot and away from the noise at the bar. The charcuterie were very well made- delish! we couldn't finish it so we packed it to go and when i had it the next day for lunch, STILL just as good! The foie gras also was really great on the crackers. It was really good :) 

Anyway lovely restaurant in the Old Montreal neighbourhood, would definitely recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Worst steak I've had in my life and im 60 yrs old!!!! Full of fat and grissol..and raw as can be ..totally discusting..never should any competent chef serve a discusting piece of meat like that ..what the fuck is the matter with you mr chef..hang your head in shame!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to get out with friends!  Good food served in a fun atmosphere.  The ceviches are fresh and delicious, their hamburgers are generous and tasty, and everything else is an above par choice.  Been many times, never had a bad meal!  Price are very reasonable for the area."}
{"text":"The food was better than I expected. I'll give it that. 

This is one of those places confused as to whether it is a club or a restaurant. We saw a few of them in Montreal and it looked like it is the new trend. Personally, I'd prefer to have my clubbing separate from dinner, but whatever.

We were starving and wandered in here because I wanted some beef flesh and the place calls itself the beef merchant. The atmosphere was blah, with loud music, disinterested bartenders, and clubby decor.

But the food was good. I had the equivalent of steak frites although they don't call it steak frites. Much better than I would expect from this place. The sauce was a red wine reduction served with pearl onions that popped with flavor in your mouth.

So it you like the club/restaurant scene, you might enjoy this place. Not my thing."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and had a great time. Definitely go in expecting it to be loud enough to disrupt conversations. If that's not your thing - find a different place to go. But it was a really cool vibe, from the music to the soft red uplighting... definitely a fun place to be. And it was pretty packed. 

We all tried different varieties of the tartare, and they were all good, but the salmon was my favorite by far. One other member of our party also had the shrimp tempura, which I didn't get to taste but it looked super fun and delicious - served kind of like shrimp lollipops stuck in a wooden block!

Drinks here were REALLY yummy... but definitely on the pricey side. I've heard the raspberry mojito is the best, but unfortunately they were out of raspberry when I visited so I had the strawberry. Also pretty tasty, so I'm not even sure I would've preferred raspberry! 

I also give this place props for the multiple-sized glasses of wine. You get your choice of 5oz or 8oz - pretty nice so you don't have to keep ordering more if you just want a bigger one to begin with. Savings cost-wise are negligible, but it was still right up my alley. 

To conclude, I'll give this place major props for customer service. We had the owner come by not only to check on how we were doing, but also to deliver my friend's birthday cake personally. Really nice guy. Our service was also pretty good, and we got a couple rounds of comped shots. And everyone spoke English as well as French, which was a nice bonus for me, the lone English speaker in my group :)

You will definitely have a good time at Mechant Boeuf!!"}
{"text":"I came with coworkers a few weeks ago during my first trip to Montreal.  First off, the service was excellent. Our server, Jo, was patient and easily explained/translated the menu for us.  Even the manager stopped by to check in. 

We tried pretty much all of their appetizers (we were a large group). I don't think there was one that I did not like. All of the fish was fresh and cooked to perfection. I'm not a big poutine fan, but even that was very good.  I had the grilled salmon for my main entree and it was very good.  The drinks were also well mixed.

I would definitely return to this place on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"There are so many choices in Montreal it is really hard to decide where to turn.
Basically i had scoured a ton of reviews on yelp and couldn't decide so i walked around, checked out the menu's and chose this place.
Glad i did.
Service was outstanding, very friendly and professional.
Our server recommended the poutine. Never heard of it myself but i sounded interesting, french fries covered in gravy, cheese curds and shredded pork.
Everyone should have this! It was fantastic, great tasting fries, smothered in delicious light gravy with curly cheese curds topped with the most delicious shredded pork i've had in a long, long time. If i return i'll order this and a loaf of the lovely french bread and that's my dinner!
App portion is for sharing as its quite substantial.
We had the strip steak, was ok, maybe a little too much fat for my liking but cooked right and served with mashed potato and seasonal crisp vegetable.
Bar was well stocked and comfortable, drink prices are comparable to any similar restaurant close by, all in all a good visit, located in a vibrant trendy part of town."}
{"text":"Found this place while strolling down the cobble stone streets of Montreal. The inside is really neat, it looks like a night club; only odd thing I noticed, was that they had TV, but they were set to an old western TV show (not sure if that's the norm). I took a seat at the bar and was greeted by a very friendly and attractive bartender. I sampled a few of the local (Canadian) wines and cheeses and all were very delicious. Ended up meeting the restaurant manager as well and he was very hospitable."}
{"text":"I wish I can give this place a 3.5. I didn't hate this place but I think the fact that it's located in the Old Port is what \"makes\" the restaurant. My dish was really forgettable to be honest. I ordered the chicken chipotle burger and truly, the only word that comes to mind is \"meh\". I took a few entrees as well to split with my hubby and event those were \"meh\". 
Come to think of it, I wish I can give this place 2.5 stars instead. I won't be back"}
{"text":"After my first visit at Mechant Boeuf I gave it a pretty damn good review. Well I'm gonna take most of what I said BACK. Because this week I went back for a friend' birthday dinner party and I almost choked on the level of crap I witnessed at this restaurant. Things have changed.
THE GOOD

As an entrée I combo-ed two of them after I saw the same dish fly by to another table and the waiter was kind of forced to comply with my request. I had the Sliders which they call the Burger Flight and with Charlevoix Poutine with braised pork, Migneron cheese. I must admit that the sliders were awesome with the little tangy mayonnaise, cherry-tomatoes and perfectly tasting meat. And the poutine was very good as usual. The service was still very friendly and casual. The Good ends there.
THE BAD

Anyone who knows me, knows I live for steak. If you wrap it up with bacon its even better, if you slather it with Foie Gras sauce, I have a complete mental collapse from the goddness. This is what they offered.

In my previous review I raved about their Foie Gras sauce but the restaurateurs went and changed it to save of food-cost most likely and cut it down with pepper sauce. It completely changed the sauce and ruined it making the appeal of the main fly away like a bird.

Next up was what I dunk in my sauce, the steak. I love eating meat, show me a way I've never eaten before and I'll try it. But the good ol' standards stick with me and a tasty steak tops the list. I've had steak all over North America. There's only one way to eat steak and properly enjoy its flavour, its texture, its juices and that's RARE. You can eat Flank Steak and if it's properly prepared it'll be tender despite being the toughest but yet most flavourful cut of meat.

I ordered a NY strip rare and what I got was a piece of rubber I could hardly cut through without having the steak slip and sliding all over my plate. Chewwing? That was impossible. I wanted to install a mandibular grinder to pre-grind my meat for me. So impossibly chewy steak with disgustingly peppery Foie Gras sauce. But WAIT, it's gets better?
THE UGLY

I of course called up the waiter to complained about the rubber boot on my plate and this is where it gets sad and yet funny. The waiter goes and talks with the manager about the situation and comes back to tell me that it's normal for rare steak to be chewy. WHAT THE FUCK? WHEN DID THIS WARP IN THE UNIVERSE HAPPEN? Talk about crappy client service, piss poor knowledge of meat preparation and total lack of respect. In most restaurants where I pay 40$ for a piece of crap meat, the manager has the decency to come over to my table and talk to me personally and makes a deal. This time no deal other than to re-fire my steak, which duh, would have given me a medium steak and a steak that has already cooled down after cooking cannot be re-heated. Go ahead and try it, it's horrible because it boils the meat.

Someone else at my table ordered the Pan-Seared Foie Gras at 13$ a pop. This was the biggest joke of the night. It was barely a quarter of a liver and it was burnt to a crisp. I wanted to scream bloody murder. If it weren't for the fact that it was my friend's birthday party I would have exploded.

This is obviously a case of retards with no experience who have no place opening a restaurant who decided to open the next trendy go-to hot spot. All form and no function. It looks cool, it's pretty, it's trendy but the food is horrible. Méchant Buf can sling some tasty burgers but that's where they peak."}
{"text":"Great poutine and service.  There was miscommunication between the waiters and the manager graciously comped us our drinks (Canadian beer which were both very good) for waiting a tad bit too long before our order was placed.  The waiter apologized, we were so impressed with their professionalism and generosity!  
The place is big with a long rectangular shape, bar and DJ with an excellent choice in music/mixing.  You won't be disappointed- great variety in the menu and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is a chic little place but pricey.
The Physical plate that the dozen Oysters came in was huge but thye actual oysters were super tiny. I had the bison tartare which was delicious and came with a tasty side salad and fries. Hubby also had a platter but with hangar steak. That was nice but not as nice as the bison. Good overall service but we left somewhat hungry to go to our next haunt."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for a late dinner with friends, it has a beautiful Devore and they have a pretty solid menu everything from steak to oysters to burgers.

We tried the shrimp as an appetizer they were phenomenal and we tried there burger made from angus beef and there bavette (steak) and mashed potatoes.

The meat was a little over cooked but the mash was really good a nice blend of goat geese mixed in delicious.

The only issue I had was the price, a little steep but you do pay for the ambience, an old Montreal sure is pretty."}
{"text":"Just awesome!

OK, the name means \"Mad Beef'. We went there around 6 pm and the place filled up quickly. The food was very good and the service was excellent. I had the steak tartar and grilled tuna. Both were quite good.

Loved the Janis Joplin cover band. They played some Norah Jones which was refreshing.

Overall, this is a nice trendy place. It will get crowded fast and the whole point is to go with the flow and enjoy the crowd & vibe"}
{"text":"Our hotel concierge recommended this place once we checked in.  We were tired and starving.  

The restaurant's ambiance was hip and fun.  Even though it was a weekday, there was a swanky vibe.  We had an excellent waitress who was very helpful.  

I am not a drinker but their Meloncito was calling my name.  It was as delicious as it sounded.  So much so that I had two!

I ordered the crab cakes which was an ample portion.  They weren't the best crab cakes I have ever eaten, but not the worst either.  My partner had a burger.  It was equally adequate.

The meal was rather pricey, but if you are looking for a great/romantic/upbeat ambiance coupled with a great cocktail and decent food, this place is a good bet!"}
{"text":"Limited menu but very large portions. 2 of us were not able to eat 1/2 of the poutine with pork. Large pork steak. Good. And considering how many restaurants in the area required reservations it was nice to be able to walk in and sit down after a tiring day walking miles weaving through the old section of Montreal ."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good, bar service too..

Ordered the rib steak, and it was cooked to my liking, but NO TASTE.  I'm betting they took it straight out of the freezer and onto the grill without letting it rest.. that's just my armature assumption, but as a big steak lover I can say I've had MUCH better elsewhere and even on my own grill.  Maybe in the future if I go back I'll try my luck with the burger.

As for atmosphere it seemed nice and the bar looks like a good spot to have your meal.  The location is well situated in the old port."}
{"text":"Nooo what happened to the portion size. Got a 8oz steak on a huge empty plate. Sorry with 3 small asparagus. And fries on a different plate?? Steak was good. But the fries were the over fried bottom leftovers. Atmosphere and service is as great as ever but the menu changed and the presentation was disappointing. Go back to how it was before!"}
{"text":"First impression: a little tacky and exaggerated. The restaurant hosts a live DJ Thursday through Sunday, who only serves to play loud radio music. 

The Thursday special was 20oz of Griffin, blonde or red, for $6. They did have an appropriate sized cocktail list with some interesting options and at reasonable prices. 

We decided not to start with an appetizer but I really wanted to try the bison tartare (so if someone tries it please let me know how it was!!). We both ordered the hanger steak medium rare, accompanied with steamed veggies and fries. Aside from the steak being beautifully cooked, it was seasoned with a simple Montreal steak spice. Was hoping for something more original from a restaurant with beef in its name. I can't say I expected much from the sides but for $24 the cook could have grilled the veggies and just do the fries differently (more crisp maybe?). 

Interestingly the steak came with a spoonful of cipollinis, which according to foodterms.com are \"bittersweet bulbs of the grape hyacinth that taste and look like small onions\". I liked this small part if the dish the most because it was original and paired nicely with the steak.

The food was alright. The service was great. If I came back it would not be for a meal, but to grab a beer and a snack."}
{"text":"We got to Mechant Boeuf looking for somewhere quick and inexpensive to eat (there was a $27 table d'hote), but ended up having an awesome time. We took two seats at the bar and instantly felt at home. The bartender (Nikki) has us giggling and smiling throughout the night and she was super quick to get us our drinks and super informative with her suggestions (awesome onion soup!). They didn't have the wine we ordered, but she quickly called over their sommelier and he suggested a wine that might actually have suited our tastes better than the one we ordered. The food was great, but I'll definitely be coming back for the service. Thanks Nikki and the rest of the team!"}
{"text":"Not bad trendy.closer to 3,5 
The good: service e is prompt. Great choices if you're a meat eater. They have \"viande sauvage\" for starters. We ordered their signature lamb chops and vivaneau platter.
The bad: they have a lot of competition around them. Pricey but great quality of food. There was a DJ in the \"house\".
The ugly: Quite popular so need to reserve but reservation good for 2-2,5hrs only. Like everything in the Old Port, parking is solo difficult to find close to it.
Tip: good for an initiate setting, lunch meals just as good but better price...there are other competitive restos nearby like Modavie or Gibby's. Price range $$-$$$"}
{"text":"If i had rated on the first visit I would have probably gave it 4 stars, but I went twice !
On a week day evening it's quieter and they have live music, the food was great the service awesome,

But on a Sunday night things where less perfect, the food was o.k. but my new york 14 oz Pittsburgh cook medium rare was dryish inside, I think it's more for the piece of meat itself that the cooking that was done perfectly. 

But overall it was the proximity of the tables and loud customers that ruined it.

feel the place is more appropriate for groups than couples."}
{"text":"Despite being incredibly busy on one of the most beautiful nights the hostess welcomed us in and made it possible to sit at the most perfect table by the window (major score!) 

We ordered the mini burgers, pulled pork poutine and steak. There was 3 of us and the mini burgers came in 2's but they wouldn't accommodate our request to have an order of three. Most restaurants will do this and charge for the extra burger. But it was just no, so we ordered two orders. 

Our dining mate who had the steak, didn't like it. Aside from being over done it came smothered in sauce that looked like cherries (but was onions) so it was not what she was expecting and she ate about half. Had anyone asked she would have said so, but no one checked during or after to see if she enjoyed it. 

The service was slow, it took at least 30 min for the mini burgers to arrive and just as long to receive our bill when we done. 

They don't really need to care though - it has a great location in Old Montreal and the  place is packed. 

But if I'm craving a steak in old Montreal, next time I'll go to The Keg."}
{"text":"We were in Montreal a few weeks back on a house hunting trip. I've been working out of our office in town, flying home on weekends, so have been able to try a lot of local eateries, and my wife was pretty keen to try this pulled pork poutine is been raving about. . . Only problem is we were travelling with our seven month old. When we arrived J-F, the maître d', was so kind. He locked our stroller in the otherwise unused coat check, seated us in the most quiet corner, and reassured us repeatedly how it was no problem us having the baby with us. This was our first night venturing outside of room service - we didn't want to \"those people\" who take a crying baby out and ruin everyone else's evening - but My wife just HAD to have that poutine! We did our best to order and eat as quickly as possible, since the little one was very quiet when we first arrived, but the music and atmosphere got the best of him and we eventually had to take turns walking and rocking him. The staff were all understanding, and we paid and left as quickly as possible, but J-F made a point of telling us about being a parent himself, and about his family is so important in Quebec, and reassuring us that it was OK, it really meant a lot to us. That being said, once we move and settle in, we'll have a babysitter for evenings out, but the entire experience was handled so well by the staff I just had to comment and say \"thank you!\""}
{"text":"good as it gets; fun steakhouse; known for their tartar; fun bar scene lively place; good for groups for a late night find; down in historic old montreal"}
{"text":"great decor and atmosphere, the red lighting gave it some what of a supper club feel. The live band was not my cup of tea though, i think they play every evening. Its really too noisy if you sit close to the little stage. We started off with 12 oysters which tasted really good and briny, don't remember where they came from though. Followed with the fried calmari, we both enjoyed it. And as a main i had filet mignon and added grilled shrimp. The shrimp was flavourful and had a type of cajun seasoning to it. The food was pretty good, not the best steak I've ever had but it passed. I give it 3 stars because i feel the steak should have tasted better, asides from that everything was on point."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times.  The steak is delicious, beer can chicken is excellent and quite the sight!

Very cool vibe.  The DJ is also a sight to see, I won't spoil it."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place, aided significantly by the fact that raw bar chef Jason Nagy served as both purveyor of fine shell fishies, and  generally as a kick ass guide  / friend in Montreal. Mix that with resounding hospitality from the bar staff (Sabrina in particular) and this restaurant saw ample of my time and dollars during my four day business jaunt through the city.

Steaks are fabulous, and actually a strong value compared against chain beef merchants (Ruth Chris, Morton's etc). I will also go on record as saying that the poutin is worth dying for; which is good, because if you ate it regularly, you'd die. 

I would recommend a smattering of apps (include the tartar) the raw bar especially during happy hour and lots of booze.  Make it during a happy hour, if for no other reason than to peep the DJ....and i dont mean his musical set.

Exceptionally cool, delicious and perfectly located."}
{"text":"I could not recommend this restaurant for bottomless brunch any more. Best service I have ever received. While some claim The Miche Dejeuner is more of a \"mans dish\" I was able to tackle the bread bowl of Chorizo and potatoes like the strong independent woman I believe I am. Joel stepped in after our first waitress left to shower and he took my breathe away. He made sure our mimosas were never empty and even gave us commendations for bars and places to see in Montreal. You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Literally amazing. Get the charcuterie and have a flavor adventure with your mouth while you go on a magical house music journey with a tasteful DJ"}
{"text":"Disappointing. For a steakhouse located in the heart of old Montreal, I wonder how long this place will survive given the abundance of competition in this area. The steak was overcooked, which is unacceptable given the price and the fact that this place bills itself as a steakhouse. The calamari appetizer was good, but who cares when you end up paying so much for an entree that is so disappointing. There are many more steak house style restaurants in old Montreal that are worthier of your attention and $. I suggest trying one of them."}
{"text":"I went to Méchant Boeuf for the first time for my boyfriend's mother's birthday. It's at a great location in the Old Port and very easy to find. With the live DJ and great happy hour deals (half off cocktails and $1 oysters), it's a nice place to start the night. The decor was modern and very old port-like, a bit fancy and an older crowd. The food was awesome, and I definitely recommend the burrata entrée to share! I had the lobster gnocchi which was also good, and I tried my boyfriend's filet mignon which was cooked perfectly. They even surprised us with a birthday cake! However, I took off a star because overall, it was too expensive for what it was so I would only come back for the happy hour deals and the groovy music."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner recently during a visit to Montreal. Ordered the New York steak with gorgonzola sauce and the half lobster and a glass of the house Cabernet. My meal was fantastic. The service was great, the staff was attentive and friendly, the vibe was very cozy and nice and the atmosphere was upscale and trendy... the illuminated bar changed hues gradually... etc. Dinner was on the pricey side but well worth it. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This bar has a late night menu which was convenient, the latest food we could find last night. The raw bar offerings were ok, shrimp and oysters were good. The tuna tartare was delicious, on top of a potato salad. Spinach dip was fairy good as well. Service was fast and attentive, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went to this place a few weeks/months ago
The decor is very beautiful .. they have an Oysters bar... i liked that very much
But the service was not too great ... we waited quiet a while for our drinks and our orders 
At one point we were betting we could easily get out and leave and the waiter would not even noticed ( we did not of course )
I also did not like the... is it a restaurant or a club kind of vibe .. there was a DJ and people dancing ... some others screaming ( or talking very loud ) at the very end of the club ... and some others eating .!!!
Am happy that i went ... but its a one hit wonder to me .!!!"}
{"text":"Saturday atmosphere was so chic. Great music. Food was excellent!! We will be back when we return to Montreal!!"}
