{"text":"very poor service, never ever pay first. being very dishonest.they are not gonna give you your order. I remind to get my f dessert every time. just very disappointing. sexist and racist. firstly forgot to make my sandwiches, then gave away my sandwiches to others. welcome to facebook... never ever visited again even for convenience. I would like to see them close."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and used to eat here when I moved in three years ago. However, I now stay away. This place has been listed on DineSafe numerous times with some serious infractions and yet miraculously continues to operate. The staff look miserable and don't seem to care about customers or cleanliness. On many occasions I saw them accept money while still wearing their plastic gloves and then go right back to making wraps - wearing the same gloves. Given their popularity on DineSafe, I can only imagine what else goes on there."}
{"text":"This place is great. The falafels are made fresh to order, the staff is friendly, and the prices are very reasonable (even more so with the daily specials). One of the best quick lunches in Liberty Village. Enough said."}
{"text":"Pretty good shawarma actually! I was pleasantly surprised how decent this place was. I'm being a tiny but generous with the flour star review but the delicious baklava I had at the end saved it. The by sauce used is unique, a green colour which is atypical for shawarma joints. It looked like a decent amount of care went into making it so I give this place credit. Meat wasn't amazing ( I got beef) it was still pretty good. No complaints good job Liberty"}
{"text":"I have yet to find better Shawarma in Toronto. The toppings table is overflowing with fresh veg and the meat is top quality. 

Chicken shawarma plate is huge! There are 2 sizes of shawarma wraps (reg and large) which is great.

I eat here once a week"}
{"text":"How hard is it to get an order right? Apparently for these guys, damn near impossible. First you check out and pay, then the huge bodybuilder behind the counter asks you \"Everything?\"

\"No,\" I say. \"I'll tell the guy who's going to make my sandwich.\" You know, because that makes sense.

But no, the owner wants to relay the order, and he always gets it wrong, and I always end up with cabbage or hotsauce or whatever I don't want, or I end up awkwardly correcting the poor guy in the funny paper hat trying to whip together my Shawarma.

This has happened dozens of times. The same thing, over and over again.

Dude, walk into a subway and look at how it's set up. Do that.  
-2 for disorganization.

All the same, the food itself is always good and fresh so I'll give 'em 3/5."}
{"text":"This place is small shawerma shop usually serving slow moving food. They do have good staff. This walk in shawerma joint is located right in city place which is popular residences for collage grads / noisy twenty something year olds."}
{"text":"As good as Shawrama can get.. from a middle eastern who has also visited turkey. This place has the richest choices of sides I could imagine, and they have no problem to give you as much as you want."}
{"text":"Good food but some on ground folks behave improperly.   With weekend shawarma platter (2 chicken shawarma dinner plates), Pita used to be provided along with it always. 

When I requested for one pita with this shawarma platter,  specific server (bald head guy from Middle East who cannot speak proper English) was rude enough and said he will have to charge extra for pita. 

Almost after paying more than $22 for shawarma platter, they were indeed asking for more. Very bad experience. I would suggest to check other better options in Liberty or for middle eastern food try queen street ! All the options and experience are much great."}
{"text":"I have gotten food from here a few times before - always great. But last night I found a rock in my food. Yes, a rock. How does that even happen? My tooth is still sore. Food was great  - but a ROCK?!"}
{"text":"Horrible service & horrible attitude from the lady that just seems to hate her job!! The food itself is ok at its best but the workers are rude and the place is dirty... I can only imagine what the back kitchen area looks like. 

Overall DO NOT eat here..."}
{"text":"Went there last night before a Jays game and I just wanted to give a thumbs up to the gentleman behind the cash register. Customer Service that good is hard to find at a restaurant, never mind a fast food joint. He brought us water, patiently explained how some of the sides are made, and even substituted a beef for chicken so we could get the daily deal. Give him a raise!! The food was a 4 but this guy just made my day :)"}
{"text":"Best Shawarma place I've ever been to! Good price, and friendly people! Of your in the area, you NEED yo go. Its a prerequisite!"}
{"text":"This place is wildly overpriced. $10 for a regular sized shawarma sandwich is one of the most expensive shawarma prices in Toronto.

The beef shawarma tasted like it was covered in lime juice. There was no other flavour because the lime was too powerful. It was so sour and awful that I will never be trying this place again."}
{"text":"Would not recommend as they don't use fresh ingredients got terrible food poisoning. Try other places in the area."}
{"text":"Used to be a good place where we often had tasty shawarmas, however everything is changing in time, something  for better other for worse: last time meat in shawarma was a really low quality. that's disappointing when places you like loose their standards."}
{"text":"Not a bad place at all!!!  I came here for a late lunch...just some light food because we still have a dinner plan that night. 

We ordered an entree to share, got chicken and everything in there salad section. It's really good value, for $10, the box is at least 1lb, super heavy and packed. The chicken was a bit dried but I love their rice. 

Best part is that they have two private parking spot right in front of their store, makes this quick snack run so much easier!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I came in here with low expectations. The first shawarma I ever had was in Lagos, Portugal and it was so amazing that all shawarmas in Toronto have failed me miserably. I also rarely see people in this restaurant when I walk by. 

Tonight I ordered a chicken shawarma with hot sauce and it was surprisingly good. The meat was not too dry and the toppings were fresh. The restaurant seemed clean and there were 3-4 people sitting and eating. I am not a huge shawarma fan so I probably won't be back for a few months, but it was a good alternative to the Subway across the street."}
{"text":"Good, fast and cheap: most businesses are able to hit only two of the three. This place is fast and cheap. That said, the quality is quite decent--given the speed and price. I'm a happy returning customer."}
{"text":"NO STARS!!! WORST SERVICE EVER!!! It seemed like the people behind the counter were inconvenienced by selling us 30$ worth of shawarmas. Super rude and sour faced people. NEVER AGAIN! Food was nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Should really be zero stars but that's not an option.

Had heard good things but popped in to grab lunch while I was in the area. Heard a couple people talking loudly in the back as I approached the counter. A guy storms out, hollers back to the kitchen - 'customer!'  A woman's voice says 'customer?' and he yells 'yeah!'

I stood there for a couple minutes with no movement from the back.  Moved over to the register where I had a better view of the kitchen. I could see movement so I said 'hello?'  Nothing.

Waited another minute and left.  Here I am wasting more time writing this review.  Completely ignoring a customer you know is waiting?  You're in the wrong business."}
{"text":"The best shawarma I've tasted. I ordered a beef shawarma, everything was perfect. It squashed my hungry but still wanted more. It came up to I believe around 7/8$.They add a  little spice to give it a kick while still being healthy."}
{"text":"I find that the quality of the chicken shawarma I order periodically is hit and miss, depending on who makes it. For example, today there was a new male making them in the early evening and he hardly put any sauce, veggies or chicken for that matter, in my sandwich. The chicken I noticed too was dry and they seemed to keep it in a warmer now to the right of the veggies. I would prefer if they shaved it right off the spit like they do in the authentic places. Liberty is very expensive, $9.82 with tax for a large shawarma that's hardly worth it if you get the wrong person making it! Please ensure that your staff are more consistent! We need more veggies and meat in our shawarmas, especially if you're charging those prices."}
{"text":"One of the best Shawarma places I have been to. I just moved to Toronto and I ran into this place and I really enjoy the selection. The prices are fair and the food is full of flavour. Highly recommend trying!"}
{"text":"This place is scarily unsanitary - I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. I live about a block away from this falafel place, and idiotically went here three times, hoping each time that maybe I just caught them on a bad day. I began by ordering their lentil soup (which should be a standard year-round mainstay in any Lebanese-style restaurant), but they told me that they only make it \"seasonally,\" even though it was posted on the menu; this screamed \"RUN AWAY,\" but I foolishly stayed. The counter staff and dining area seemed okay, but the first time I went, something tasted distinctly mouldy. The second time, I realised that the tomatoes in particular had a strong mouldy flavour. The last time I went, I asked that the (mouldy, I was certain by then) tomatoes be excluded from my meal, but the falafel was *extremely* gritty, as though there was sand or gravelly dirt mixed throughout all of the falafel mixture (stony/gritty enough to damage tooth enamel, I'm pretty sure). I really can't go here after the grittiness experience - it really, really worried me, and rendered the falafel completely inedible - and I know the mouldy taste is also a rotten (quite literally rotten) indicator. It's a great shame that this place isn't better, as we have very few quick eat-out options in the immediate block or two around Spadina and Bremner. I would go here a lot if the food was standard, home-cooked Lebanese food, which I really enjoy (even though this place is actually also very expensive, imo), but even my super-non-fussy omnivore guy friend told me (without me letting him know about my experiences first) that he has had horrible experiences here."}
{"text":"We always order the Chicken Dinner, with everything. Very large and generous portions. Big enough to share for two, but you probably wouldn't want to. 

I will try out the rest of the menu items"}
{"text":"I discovered Liberty Shawarma a few years ago and since then it's become one of my favourite quick eat-out spots in the city.  My addiction became quite strong to the point that I was doing there twice a week and getting an excess fill of beef and chicken shawarma.  Since then, I've managed to moderate and only go there at most once a week, however every visit is a great experience.

The portions I find are very generous and the array of ingredient are quite diverse.  My usual order is the Chicken Shawarma dinner and I really like that they have a wide selection of vegetables and salads that they throw into the mix.   The meat is always moist and cooked tender, with the great spice and flavouring.  The hot sauce they use is also awesome, it's a green colour and myself being a big fan of spicy enjoy it very much drizzled on top of my shawarma feast.

The service is pretty prompt from the get go and I find there's usually a small lineup but the cashier is able to handle the flow quickly.  After making my payment, the food prep person runs through my side order options and gets my container jam packed in no time.  I usually take it back to my house to eat and I always find I'm rushing back to enjoy and savour this delightful meal.

The only small gripe I would have is that finding parking can be quite a challenge during rush hour and I've had to park in places I probably shouldn't have to get food from here.  They do have two parking spots in front of the store but I find these are full most of the time.

In short, Liberty Shawarma is my go to take out shawarma place in Liberty Village.  Highly recommended and well deserving of a 4 star rating!"}
{"text":"One if the best shawarma wraps in the city. They have two small ones for just 9.99$. Open late , usually never busy, and good service. Their is also place to sit. Good for on the go fast food."}
{"text":"It's great to have a few new food options south of the railway tracks and north of Lakeshore, as businesses finally recognize the huge amount of potential revenue that the Cityplace neighbourhood can bring in. A few weeks ago we got the Fox and Fiddle, and now Liberty Shawarma.

Open until 4am??? Seriously??? That will be awesome for some!

The shawarma itself is very good. The hot sauce is hot and tasty. The chicken is a bit dry but I kind of like it that way, as opposed to say Nora's (up the street) that is too wet and saucy. I think all the fresh veggies and tahini compensate well.

The price, however, is a lot higher than I'm used to paying for shawarma. $6.99+tax for a small (which really is kind of small-ish), and $1.75 for a can of pop. I threw in a samosa and after tax it came to over $11.00! That's a bit high for a regular lunch budget. They had a Monday special of 2 shawarmas for $9.99 but I still think this is a bit pricey, especially when others like Ali Babas offer much better specials. I also thought the veggie samosas were on the small side and were a bit over-spiced, but this is very subjective.

Overall, I recommend anyone give this place a chance. It's always nice to see small businesses start up in the area, and I wish them all the best. I would love to see some more reasonable specials, or at least for the price offer something a little larger. For me, this will be a once-in-a-while place because of price alone. If I could get a shawarma sandwich and a can of Coke, for say $5.99+tax, or a 2-for-$7.99 deal, it'd be 5 stars all-in for me!"}
{"text":"If i can take away stars, i would. not even worth a star...The staff was rude and probably stoned ... terrible food.. will never go there again"}
{"text":"This is by far the best shawarma place in town...their ingredients are fresh and their home made hot sauce is yummy...i can literally have a chicken shawarma from their every day!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh, no matter what time... and they have late hours to ensure late night munchies are satisfied! I always get the dinners or the daily specials. So much food for the price you pay. Place is always clean too. I always see them wiping down or sweeping when not making food. Also saw them cleaning the grill each time I've been there. Staff is always polite and accommodating... this place has so far been my go to for great food and great service."}
{"text":"Been here several times, the sandwiches aren't terrible but there nothing to write home about either. However, despite their mediocre sandwiches they still charge pretty steep prices compared to other shawarma joints in the city. The fries here are actually quite good. They are simple McCain like fries with a perfect crisp but what makes them awesome is this chilli-powder they dust them with. 
What makes this place successful is it's basically the only thing open late in cityplace on the weekend. If it's dinner time during the week I'd recommend going to several other places in the area. But if it's 2 am on a Friday night then you can't really go wrong choosing liberty shawarma."}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating at Liberty Shawarma. Loads of flavour and fresh ingredients cooked on the spot for you. Great for dinner or late night always satisfying plus it's located in a fantastic neighbourhood. Go get one right noww!!"}
{"text":"I went to Liberty Shawarma on Queen East for a quick bite to eat during lunch.  Walking in, it was the first I've heard of the place, but I quickly discovered that this location was one of three that existed across the city.  My guess was that the Liberty Village location on Atlantic was the first, given the namesake of this Middle Eastern joint. 

So three locations...this place must be good, right?  Well, I can tell you that Liberty Shawarma's food is fresh, tasty, and priced well. 

Nothing screams value like their Monday special: two shawarma chicken sandwiches for $9.99, especially considering their small is usually $6.99.  You would think they would try to scrimp on quality and size but that simply isn't the case. They took what I consider a medium-sized pita (x2) and packed it to the brim with fresh ingredients: onions, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles with succulent pieces of chicken topped with garlic sauce and optional green hot sauce.  Fantastic!  There was just the right amount of sauce as the sandwich was moist but it didn't drip (this held true even with the second sandwich that I saved for dinner) - a plus if you are on the go. 

If ever in the neighborhood, I would definitely go back... especially for their daily specials."}
{"text":"Great establishment. On Sunday there are a number of specials that will fill you up for a great price. Very agreeable kitchen staff. Great taste for sure."}
{"text":"Hands down the best shawarma I've had in Toronto. Staff is courteous and friendly; food is delicious and fresh. They offer daily deals, which I find to be a fun way to get to know the whole menu.

Pro-Tip: On Sundays you can pick any of the deals!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and had the chicken shawarma and the falafel, always with the works. The prices are reasonable when buying items at the daily special price, though often a dollar or two higher on non-special days. 

Food service has always been prompt and courteous, though the establishment itself always feels a bit dirty. For takeaway it's fine. I don't know that I'd actually want to sit here and eat though. 

The food itself is always fresh with generous portions, and I've never had a bad bite of food. I'll keep coming and ordering off the specials menu, but perhaps go elsewhere if I want to dine in."}
{"text":"I tired out Liberty Shawarma for the first time yesterday for dinner.  I have to say I was impressed, the service was quick and food was great.  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma entree plate - it was filled to the brim.  The chicken was well seasoned and moist.  The sides and salad complemented the meal.  For $12 (including tax), my hunger was squashed.  

I will definitely be back to try out the sandwiches and other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I am never that impressed with the food. I go here out of convenience more than anything. Today, my friend and I bought 1 large beef shawarma, 1 small falafal and 1 bottled juice. The total was $18. A little on the expensive side, compared to other places. It seems to be fairly busy over lunch and I know they have a new location, so they must be doing ok. The staff are friendly and there are always newspapers around for a quick read."}
{"text":"Man I think these guys have the BEST shawarma in Toronto!  Maybe a spot called Paramount up in Markham, but in Toronto...Hands down!!!!  

I used to live in the building attached to this spot, and used to eat there EVERYDAY!!!!!!  Sauces are on point, food is VERY fresh due to volume, and they make good shit!   Bonus?  Open till 4am, and I would say a very safe place to go eat late at night due to the affluence!  Good eat there!  No dissappointments, and if you go in with a good attitude, they will hook you up!!!!!"}
{"text":"On my afternoon walk today I wanted to try something that wasn't a bar or anywhere a hipster was hanging out at.  On the last bit of the journey, Liberty Shawarma was staring at my face.  I love those spontaneous type of moments. 

I ordered a large beef shawarma.  Maybe the guy serving me read my mind.  He asked me if I wanted it to be spicy.  From my bit of a tired look I nodded my head in agreement.  Very tasty, right amount of spices and not a lot of garlic, even though I never mind that.  That added  with an iced tea came out to under $13.  

It's a very clean place with enough seating, even though I beat out the rush.  Maybe people don't like middle eastern food.  Hey if you don't like it or never tried it, check this place out.  They have a TV which happened to be on the news of the latest in the Rob Ford saga (UGH)!

The only knock I'd say was that I wanted to sit on the stools to people watch and unfortunately the AC did not reach there.  So I had to sit at one of the tables where I needed to cool off from the humid temps today.  

I would definitely go back to try out other dishes if I visit the area again."}
{"text":"just don't go here - dirty, rude staff, pricey. literally nothing good to say."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good - especially if you're a university student who's been studying a lot and forgot to cook something throughout the day.  I've sampled shawarmas from Asia to the UK and around Mississauga and I'm happy to say that I'm fairly happy that these guys are within walking distance.

The meat could be a little juicier and the hot plate can be a little hotter just to make my shawarma really steam inside but all that aside the flavor and the garnish was just right.

At $9.81 for a large shawarma it is slightly more expensive but I guess that's what you get for convenience.

I was also a little disappointed to not see lamb or goat on the menu.  Hopefully someday soon!"}
{"text":"Liberty is great. It seemingly induced some nostalgia for my Ottawa-roots, where shawarma is found at just about every city block. One of the better shawarma spots I've stumbled on in Toronto. One small chicken, one small falafel, baclava. Done."}
{"text":"so i came to check this place out today because everyone i know rants and raves about how amazing it is and how they have the best Shawarma's in Toronto.... errm... i disagree. They're OK.. I had the small chicken shawarma with everything in it.

1) it was stuff way too much with veggies and not enough chicken
2) i asked for extra garlic sauce and he rolled his eyes at me
3) no one was in the place, not sure why i had to pay first (with a tip option) prior to even getting served
4) the place was kind of dirty.. there was used paper everywhere, definitely didn't entice me to stay and eat!

all in all, $10 later, it was mediocre... not a place i would be returning.

oh and ps - the sauce dripped all over my shoes through the paper bag before i even got home!"}
{"text":"Mediocre shawarma. However the $9.99 for shawarma, fries and a drink is a great price. The employees are nice and work fast. Again, just mediocre. Nothing too spectacular."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best shawarma places in the city. The other location on Spadina is constantly failing their health inspections, but thankfully this location doesn't have the same issues. Their dinner platters may be a bit on the pricey side compared to Ali Baba's, but you get a ton of food for the cost, though the amount of meat (and quality of service) you get sometimes varies with who is serving you and time of day. I find it you're there dinner instead of lunch, they tend to be a bit more generous with the meat. Speaking of the meat, it is much better seasoned and much tastier than other places I've tried, and their vegetable selection is also extremely varied (the garlic potatoes are incredible), so I always make sure to ask for half the rice and extra veg instead. Also beware that their hot sauce is quite tasty (and looks homemade), but is also super spicy. Perfect post-workout meal."}
{"text":"I don't hand out 1 stars lightly, and as always it pains me to do so, however, the experience I had at this little shawarma shop Saturday night needs to be told. It was about 10pm and all I wanted was something cheap, filling and fresh to eat... not a lot to ask right? 

I ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich and a bottle of water, which was supposed to be a special for $9.99 as posted. However, 2 drinks and a shawarma sandwich came out to $16!!! I lived in Windsor for almost 2 years (a little known shawarma capital of Canada.. no joke!) And while the shawarma options were plentiful, I never paid more than $4 for a sandwich!

While the price was obscene, where this place looses its points is in how they approach the creation of their sandwich. I'm used to eating a shawarma that is freshly shaved off the spit, cooked slightly on the flat top and tossed into pita. Not here, the meat was pre-shaved and sitting in a metal container on the flat top - keeping warm. The result was an overcooked, dry and at times HARD chicken filler. Dog Food to be honest...

The final nail in the coffin was when the sandwich was being assembled - Normal etiquette is, if the pita rips in half, you remake the sandwich again. Not here, it fell apart and was tossed in the panini press to smush it all together before being wrapped tightly. I mentioned the sandwich was falling apart before they wrapped it (which would be an indicator for the staff to offer to remake it) instead I was told \"don't worry about it - I got this.\" Apparently not, it was falling apart as I unwrapped it before I could even take a bite...."}
{"text":"I have had a variety of different foods here, probably most things on the menu.

2/5 the service here tends to be crappy in Canadian standards, but if you don't care about their shitty attitudes, and believe that they are still good at heart, the food aint so bad.

3/5 the food usually is delicious, doesnt scream fresh at you, but overall a decent offering and the sandwich sauce is not too bad. consistently tastes the same. 

4/5 prices are quite good, with many specials for 12$ for two wraps 

3/5 the place is conveniently located, but somewhat greasy and sometimes even skiddish? 

so not too bad, but dont jump out of bed to come here"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. Eat here at your own risk as they been on the dinesafe list occasionally for conditional pass.  I do not know why they keep going on the list but they aren't doing something right.  On to the food, they keep their meat already shaved which is not good as they are over cooked when they reheat it.  Must be older meat of something cause it was dry and hard.  Price is higher than the normal shawarma place I go to.  Will not be back for sure"}
{"text":"Great that it is open until 4am on Friday and Saturday for that after-bar snack. They have free chips while you wait. 

But its hot inside because of the open concept kitchen, would be better if they turned up the A/C.

Decent prices. Food a bit on the greasy side. 

Try the garlic potatoes fries."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. For the most part, the staff are very pleasant and respectful. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken shawarma, fries, and grape leaves for take-out at a good price. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Best falafel in the WORLD! Don't try anything else, just get the little balls of perfection."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken Sharma plate.  The next two days I had food poisoning.  The black bean salad i discovered the next day was actually rancid and smelled very sour! I think this was actually the cause and not the chicken because it was not that bad; although it swam in garlic sauce. I would not advise eating here. ..."}
{"text":"I was told by a friend that I must try out the place if I want really good chicken shawerma with good portions of meat. 

One big problem that I have with shawerma these days, is there's too little chicken and a lot of salad which ends up tasting like a salad sandwich.  I have to admit, compared to the other places iv tried in the downtown core, they definately don't stack up to this place when it comes to taste and size. To make things more interesting, before I left I decided to try the falafel which to my surprise, ended up being even better than the sandwich I just had. 

Being a big-time Sherman critic, I have to give the place two thumbs up especially if you're in the downtown core"}
{"text":"I usually come on Monday for their 2 small chicken shawarmas for $10 or Tuesday for their 2 small falafel shawarmas for $8. They have other daily specials, but those are more suitable if you're eating with someone (ex 2 shawarma platters for $18?) The quality is to expected for a fast food shawarma spot. In this region, this is the only shawarma spot that I know of, so if you live at Cityplace and you're craving shawarma, I would recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I tried this place a while back when they first opened and I wasn't impressed. Two years later I decided to give it another try and I regret doing so. The Shawerma has no flavour, the sandwich is small and far from filling. If you're looking for a quick bite it's not horrible but definitely not in my top 25 Shawerma places in Toronto. I've heard the other locations even worse and have been shut down many times for health infractions."}
{"text":"When you eat something that lacks this much heart and soul you just have to look down at the floor and say to yourself, \"okay... I paid money for this\". Then you let out a sigh and try to soldier through it... Shame I threw it out before I could even finish half...Couldn't bring myself to take another bite. 

This is the epitome of the word \"hot mess\" in food form... It was like eating a brick of hot salt with shredded lettuce... Just TERRIBLE.

Wasting food is just as sad as having to complain about it, but I will stand my ground on how this place should be STEERED CLEAR OF... Not to mention the place smells like OLD, gross mop water when you walk into the place (think musty basement + pee... mmmm way to whet the appetite, guys!!)

If you are smart, heed my words and stay far, far away from this rubbish... WORST food in Liberty Village..."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. Depends who you get building your plate or shawarma in terms of ingredients balance, amount of meat, etc. It does the job though!"}
{"text":"Really great... had the chicken shwarma, and though I'm not a fan of the stuff that's already been cut off the massive slab of rotating meat and sitting on the bottom, it was all very juicy and tasty.

I'll just ask the guy to cut fresh meat next time since the stuff still on the spit looked amazing."}
{"text":"ITS AMAZING!!!! They give reasonable portions and I've never had any issues with their staff before. I live right by there and have it almost once a week! 

This place is definitely underrated. Idk what all these other people have to complain about in their reviews."}
{"text":"Dry dry chicken in shawerma. Had to return it after 1 bite and had to wait for them to make another. A lot of vegetable filling not enough chicken in it. Next time I'll go to subway - less disappointment"}
{"text":"Horrible place with really horrible staff. Just stuffing meat in pita bread and charging $15, also have to deal with the staffs attitude. Will never go back there."}
{"text":"I'm not a big shawarma fan but I needed a quick bite to eat and it was conveniently right by our place. I ordered the beef shawarma combo and the wife had the small falafel. They also had these small samosas but there were $1.50 each, which I think were priced too high for my standards. I love samosas but I didn't get any.

The service was a little uncomfortable and I don't think they can handle to take more than 2 orders at a time. They seemed frazzled when there were only 3 customers in the store and panicked about our toppings when I asked for everything except lettuce. I still got lettuce in mine. Even the cashier kept punching in our order wrong. Which was weird because I thought we had to order first. It's my first time here so I don't know if they have different staff and have different ordering process in the weekdays.

The food itself was okay. The falafel was actually very tasty but the beef was tough and dry. I should've gotten the chicken but feared that it would be too dry. I guess you just can't win all the time. What I had trouble with was how the wrap were made. They should be made so it would easier to eat with the toppings and main to be distributed evenly with each eat bite. Instead the main were on one side and the toppings on the other. It was like eating two different wraps. Unless I'm eating it wrong and you are meant to eat it on its side instead of flat. Other than that, the fries were very good! Light and crispy - just the way I like it.

If I'm too lazy to cook dinner, this would be my second choice next to pizza. I would definitely come back for the falafel and fries."}
{"text":"delicious chicken shawarma! very generous sizes - def worth 2 meals. people are very helpful when deciding what to order, how to do add-ons.  green hot sauce (i forget the actual name of it) is spicy but sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Came here for a second time to give it a chance and lord have mercy I wish I didn't very rude overall. The rice was scraped from the bottom as it was rock hard and crunchy. The salad leafs were brown and tasted off. The falalef was a complete joke. It was rock hard and tasted burnt. Upon servicing it I was like are you seriously going to serve this and they both looked at me like what's the problem yea it's a little hard but that's the way it's supposed to be. Never again no more chances and just because it's late and the only place open I'd rather go home and have boiled eggs or starve!!!"}
{"text":"BEST EVER. So fresh. So many amazing toppings. You get tons of food for an awesome price. Staff are nice, place is clean. Food is amazing. I am addicted."}
{"text":"This I think used to be a great shawarma place for the food, but the service alone pisses me off. I am a white female who happens to love very spicy food. I asked for my plate to be extra spicy and the man looked up at me and said \"for YOU, this will be spicy enough.\" I explained, \"no really, I really would like it to be very spicy.\" He laughed and continued to refuse to put more on (there was only a small amount of spicy sauce on it at the time), and said \"No, this will be spicy enough for you, trust me.\" The way he said it and laughed at me was offensive. I realized he was implying because I am white, I cannot handle spicy food (as many people assume). I mentioned that, and clarified that I'd like extra spicy sauce despite my appearance and what he may assume. He refused again and just said \"believe me this is spicy enough for you.\" 
When I returned home to eat the meal...it was not spicy in the least. I am extremely offended that because of what I may look like I can handle was judged, my request was not fulfilled, and I paid for a meal that I did not enjoy. This man provided terrible service to me and it is not his job to judge the amount of spice a person can handle."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst shawarma place I have ever been to. They provide you with barely any chicken/meat (I tested this a couple times, and others at my work have stated the same). So basically, I'm being charged for condiments and pita bread. 
I think the only thing that is good here is the baklava - which is overpriced.

Other than that, the owner and all his staff are rude except maybe 1 guy there. The place is pretty ghetto considering its in Liberty Village. I guess the area is so desperate for lunch places around here that it gets business. I can't see there to be any other good reason. Never again!"}
{"text":"We lunch at King Falafel at least once a week.  I'm a big fan of the falafel plate.  I comes piled high with salads, rice, 6 falafels, great hummous, and really tasty hot sauce.  

The plates are so big that we rarely finish all the food.  I've started ordering with no rice because I was wasting so much.  For $10 it's hard to find better value."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.  

I have had incredibly tasty chicken here and other times it's dry and no flavour. 

This time around I'll give it 4 stars as it was delicious!!!  I still don't love the jalapeño based hot sauce.   

It's definitely worth popping in for lunch.  Just don't be first in the door or the chicken will be burnt on the exterior."}
{"text":"Check out the dine safe lists.   This place is quite often flagged for unsafe food.  

I myself was once served completely raw chicken on a salad.  When i took it back, they picked the chicken off tried cooking it again and giving me back the same salad.   

I haven't been back."}
{"text":"Liberty on Queen East near Broadview - even though there is no separate listing this place was so bad that I am compelled to write a review to warn the world. I get it, they are in downtown Toronto. But no one is Toronto can justify $6.99 per shawarma. The beef shawarma was like gyro meat, not fresh juicy shaved beef; and the chicken was just as terrible. A guy came in and asked for tzatkizi on his shawarma and obviously he had no clue in trying to impress his date that this is an Arab not Greek place- but they obliged by dousing his shawarma in tahini sauce! Cold shawarmas, terrible service. I'm still shocked at the Vancouver shawarma prices!"}
{"text":"Excellent Shawarma & Falafel, probably my favourite in the city. They also deliver which is cool. I recommend their chicken shawarma with a side of potatoes with garlic & hot sauce."}
{"text":"There's shawarma and then there's shawarma and this is shawarma. Grab it at this spot. Takes about as long as shawarma takes. 

Would be good if they had hot peppers- that's a big miss. But they're shawarma and they're here so get it here if you want shawarma and you are here."}
{"text":"With ratings going from 1-5 and middling out at 2 and a half, you're forced to wonder what the food here is actually like. I tried it out at a decent hour of about 4 PM in the afternoon and was definitely satisfied with the food I got. 

I ordered the Small Kofta Kabob wrap while my cousin got the Large beef Shawarma wrap, and it came out to about $20. Both were very good in portion size and very filling! 

The meet for the Kofta kabob took awhile to cook (About 10 mins) but well worth. A good aspect was also the variety of toppings you can get inside. Unlike most shawarma places I've been to, outside the basic lettuce, tomatoes, onions combo, you could also get a chick pea salad mix, spiced potatoes, and lentils inside your shawarma wrap.

Overall the food was good and staff was friendly. Would definitely hit this place up again if I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Located at Spadina and Bremner Rd across from the Rogers center, it serves the many locals aka CityPlace folks their cravings for shawarma.  First time I came here a fight broke out, but again that's what happens when a food business is opened till the early AM in the morning.   
LOng story short, the place is clean, the service is fast/efficient and everything is neatly displayed. 
Terms of food, my buddy and I ordered their chicken shawarma deal. in terms of ingredients, they've got all the necessary things.  HOwever in terms of taste, I honestly found the chicken to be on the bland side. 

would I come back here? only if it were the only shawarma place in the area."}
{"text":"If you've ever had Shawarma from the best Lebanese spots in Ottawa, you'll understand just how far short this place lands. I just had to throw my sandwich out it was so disgusting. I've tried a number of spots in the downtown core and it has become apparent that I wont enjoy the same quality of Lebanese cuisine in Toronto as I did in Ottawa. Disappointing..."}
{"text":"Walked into the place and my girlfriend nearly wiped out on some grease on the floor. Not a good start.

First thing I noticed is that the prices are jacked up a little higher, possibly trying to take advantage of the Liberty Village location. Their combo platters were a good $3 more than most places downtown. Cans of pop are $1.75 for crying out loud.

Dude preparing our order used his hands to scoop ingredients. He was wearing plastic gloves, but it still sort of surprised me. The restaurant itself isn't very pleasant-looking.

Food was decent. I've had better and I've had worse, but certainly not willing to pay more in the future. I'll stick with my usual trusted spots."}
{"text":"dirty, rude and unsanitary staff is what brought me here to review this place. Do not eat here- I repeat- DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"This place has changed its name. It's now \"Liberty Shawarma\". It still has the same owners. And now they have daily specials instead of just one."}
{"text":"First time experiencing middle eastern food, so flavourful and delicious. The restaurant was extremely clean and friendly. I'm sure to be back!"}
{"text":"I eat out pretty often. Always willing to try new things. I love Shawarma and have tried many Shawarma places. This is by far the best Shawarma in the city! 

I always get the Shawarma plate because I love the rice and salads. 
They have mountains of fresh and different salads that no other place has. The meat is delicious and pilled on high. The outside crispy bits of the chicken are my favorite and still moist on the inside. The rice is also amazing and one of a kind, mixed with lentils in it. The salads include chickpea salad, tomato salad, mixed vegetable. And they top it off with these grilled eggplant chips, garlic sauce and hummus. 

The best part is its under $14 and it easlily feeds 2 people! 

It is really unique and the best Shawarma I have ever had! Love it, Love it, love it! I will continue to go once a week! :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Shawarma in Liberty village. Period! There are a couple of other shawarma places (on king), but they fall far behind in the quality of the ingredients.

Shawarma is not rocket science - you need fresh and quality ingredients and fresh cooking. That's it.  This place hits the spot! The chicken and beef they use are a class above similar joints in quality, and their sides (so many of them! including pan-fried eggplant which nobody else offers as a free side!) are so many and always fresh!

I cut one star off since their platters/dinners (what I usually get) are pricey at $13, and also they sometimes burn the chicken on the outside of the shawarma roll.  Not a big deal, and some people like it, but I'd rather not have it.

The ambiance is pretty basic, fast-food type, but clean.  The owner is awesome, usually working the cash register during lunch hours, and has free snacks on the counter for you to munch on while you wait in line.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I was there today. Food is ok but overpriced. The sandwiches were very soggy. We ended up eating them with a fork! Flavour wise they were ok but not enough to justify the mess. Very expensive. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Liberty Shawarma since [as others point out] it used to be called King Shawarma.  I like (maybe love?) it so much that some of my friends find the frequency of my check-ins to this place to be irritatingly frequent ;-P

If you read others' reviews on Yelp, you'll see that the owner's pride in the variety & quality of his ingredients is well founded.  I've read all the other reviews (to-date) and have to agree with them all on every good thing they point out.  I've had almost everything in the menu, too.  The prices are fair for such fine fare.

Something to add that others haven't yet...  There's an LCD TV hanging in the corner with news playing on it - gives you something to watch with current events and in a short-attention-span friendly format.  Actually, the view out from inside is good too, because you can see up Snooker Street (formerly Hanna Ave.), and there are a lot of interesting and good looking people in Liberty Village, if you're into people watching...  There's a bar-style counter in front of the window, and chairs/stools to park yourself for the view and taste-bud tantalization.

Free parking is scant in this area, so it's hard to find, especially with the continuously increasing traffic of Liberty Village.

Have no Point-of-Sale fear, Liberty Shawarma accepts cash, credit (Visa & MasterCard), and debit.

So, why am I writing this review, after going there for over a year, and checking-in on Yelp for months?  Because I'm about to head over there for a Shawarma Entrée just like Rick Y. praises, and this time I felt that I had to express my love for Liberty Shawarma."}
{"text":"This place use to be one of my favourite Shwarma places but I believe its under new ownership/management. Sadly, I went in the other day and the staff were rude and annoyed to be working there (particularly the new lady working behind the counter Wednesday nights).
I paid for extra chicken and got about 1 tablespoon of over cooked chicken.
Its too bad this place went downhill....."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of shawarmas, I would definitely recommend this place.  I had the small chicken shawarma and it was out of this world - delicious and a good-sized portion.  I didn't find the chicken dry at all; it was so flavourful and cooked to perfection.  The toppings (turnips, parsley, hummus, etc.) were so fresh as if they were just mad that morning.  The killer was the green hot sauce; it was pretty spicy and had a ton of flavour.  The service was fast and the guys were friendly.  The only small negative I have to report on is that I found $6.99 + tax to be a bit pricy for lunch, especially when other establishments offer a lot of everyday two-for-one deals.  All in all, I was very impressed!  My colleague and I are going there tomorrow for lunch."}
{"text":"This is my favourite shawarma spot. Shawarma's are yummy when made properly. But so many places in the city make horrible shawarma's and charge high prices. As a standard rule, if the spit isn't loaded I don't eat there. The whole point of meat on a spit is for the fat to drip down and give it flavour. Liberty Shawarma always has a spit that's loaded.

I used to live in liberty village and would go to that location a lot. I just happened to be on the east side and tried this location. It was so good. The guy cut it directly off the spit for me. I think that's the best way to have it really. Because sometimes they'll cut it off then leave it to sit and it gets burnt and crispy. 

The large is 8.99 and on certain days they have a two small for $10 special. It's good if you're on the go. Or if you want a burrito type thingamajig without all the calories. So yeah, decent spot just make sure it's cut off the spit fresh and feast! FYI, have the green hot sauce.

****Just as I was going to post this review I Googled them & dinesafe. My stars have been reduced to reflect what I found, YIKES!"}
{"text":"I used to go here almost once a week when i was working in the area.  The first couple of lunches were great.  The usual chicken shawarma, \"with everything spicy\".  It really hit the spot.  Juicy meat, fresh veggies and everything.  Then months later I don't know what happened.  Owner change or employee change???  It was disgusting.  The shawarma was just nasty.  I did notice different employees behind the counter so I  was thinking maybe an ownership changed happened.  After that last bad lunch, I vowed to never go back.  I used to be a fan of Liberty but definitely do not recommend it anymore."}
{"text":"Best shwarma I've ever had.   I've been to a few places around town on a top 10 list and this place blows them all away.

If you think Ghazale is good then Liberty Shwarma (formely King Shwarma) rocks them.

I look forward to doing Shwarma Saturdays with my fiance .. we're both addicted.  Nice staff too. 

They've changed to a deal a day menu instead of the 2 for $8, but it still rocks!"}
{"text":"Eaten here 4 times; all take outs.
1st time - shawarma dinner - good - too much veggies, not enough meat
2nd time - chicken shawarma - excellent!
3rd time - beef shawarma - great - beef was dry & tough (old)
4th time - chicken shawarma - ok - chicken was dry and tough (old)

As with some of the negative reviews here, the quality seems to go down with each visit.
And these were spaced visits, about 2 weeks apart, so it's not because I was getting tired of shawarma :p
Oh yeah the price is a bit high, so take advantage of the weekday deals:
Monday = 2 chicken shawarmas for $9.99, Tuesday = 2 beef shawarmas for $9.99"}
{"text":"The best shawarma I have ever tasted! The beef sandwich is delicious and bursting with exotic juices and flavours. A little on the pricey side for a lunch, but the taste is worth it. The staff are very friendly. Come in the day while the shawarma is still moist.

i totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Last time I was here I got food poisoning.  And ever since they have had many yellow flags from dine-safe.  

Too many critical issues. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Here for work so I decided to give this place a try.  I believe they have a deal on Saturdays where you get two platters for $18...??  I got the beef platter with literally everything in it.  Hummus, rice, pickled veg, cucumber, peppers, roasted cumin potato, tomato, tabouleh, lentils etc etc.  It was very tasty.  Really enjoyed their pickled red cabbage and the roasted potato.  Everything tasted fresh, seasoned well, and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Liberty Shawarma is almost too good ... I keep coming back way too often.  If you've never had a chicken shawarma from there, you should give it a try.  It's basically a pita with chunks of seasoned chicken, various vegetables to choose from, and special sauces.  The flavour is great, and it's a relatively healthy option with all those vegetables.  You can even get it in salad form, without the pita.  One word of warning:  if you ask for extra sauce, it can get quite messy.  I usually have a huge puddle of sauce on the table by the time I'm done eating my shawarma.  The servers are friendly, some of them extra friendly.  I do have a bit of an issue with the price ... a large chicken shawarma and drink can cost over $10, which is a bit pricey for lunch.  It does tend to be filling enough though, and yes, it's definitely tasty.  A friend did have an issue here once when they suddenly put peanuts in something, and since he's allergic, that is a huge issue.  However, I think that was a previous owner, and he has eaten there many times since without incident ... but if you have a peanut allergy, it wouldn't hurt to ask first if you go there.  Overall, I would recommend Liberty Shawarma for a yummy and relatively healthy lunch option."}
{"text":"Damn good shawarma.  Reallly good portion sizes and they have options for large and small just to be sute.  Daily deals are good value.  Dinner plates have an obscene amount of food."}
{"text":"It's not really shawarma the way the Arabs envisaged it to be. However, it is more than amazing. More than the meat, the fillings and hummus stand out as the stars of the show. Very friendly staff who are more than ready to cater to your requested customization(s). Bargain deals available everyday too!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Liberty Shawarma, in our 'hood.

We both ordered large chicken shawarmas.  There are lots of ingredients you can have on it ... I had tomatoes, humus, garlic sauce and tahini.  After the shawarma was put together, it was put on a grill to heat it up.  Yum!

Gord had chicken, onions, cabbage and chick peas/lentils on his.  There was so much stuff on his that it was exploding!"}
{"text":"Been there two or three times, always for a takeout.

The place is new but you can say that it will look \"old\" (politically correct way to pronounce \"filthy and wasted\") much faster than it'd actually become old. Staying clean is definitely not a strongest virtue of Liberty Shawarma.

The meat comes quite a bit over-fried to my taste, yet I liked the combination of \"everything\" you get as a side. Nice veggie cocktail! Good dressings, too. Spicy, but not a killer. Tasty, though nothing particularly memorable.

Prices are high. Very high for a recently opened place located way too far from any office cluster! I know that inflation doesn't sleep in Ontario, but these guys started pumping up the numbers right away.

Overall - ok to go and get a takeout, but nothing will happen if you'll miss that place."}
{"text":"Decent food and the daily specials are good value. Overall the place is a step downfrom habibi Sharwarma just down the street on King and Dufferin"}
{"text":"Chicken Shawarma is OK. I usually get it on Mondays when it's on special. The portions are big and you won't leave hungry. I do not leave a higher rating because some people that I know have gotten sick from their beef. I've never had an issue but just throwing it out there."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time but recently found out that it was cited with 9 food safety violations. I'm honestly surprised that it wasn't closed down but I'm definitely sure I won't end up coming back.

If you're up for the risk however, the food here is alright. Its just the regular fast food shawarma and offers the usual services. Theres nothing that really stands out about this place but I did like the shish taouk plates. Pretty much only went here since it was close to where I lived.

Try at your own risk"}
{"text":"We stopped by here between a move, to grab a quick bite to eat. I had the shawarma combo. Staff was friendly, store was clean (as clean as it can be during this mucky time of year) and the food was great! The house hot sauce or whatever that green bottle of awesomeness was is super good. The ingredients were fresh and I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This pertains to the Liberty on Queen East near Broadview (at the time of my review there is no separate listing for it). This used be Pia Mio or something like that. The previous owner's shwarma's were fantastic and you could get two for $8. the chicken was crispy and the shwarmas were made with care. But now that Liberty has taken over this location, the shwarmas are now twice the price ($8 for a small one!) and the quality has gone down the tubes. right now I am eating a cold shwarma with very little meat and lot of sauce making the shell fall apart. i am about to give up eating it. they don't bother wrapping them properly and heating them up. they shave off a bunch of chicken and beef ahead of time instead of for each sandwich them make - this makes the meat cold and less flavourful. so 1/2 the quality for 2x the price. sorry but I wont be going back unless i am absolutely craving a shwarma. horrible.

A waste of money."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I have had at a fast food restaurant ever. I ordered, it seemed the man understood, he turned and started to prepare something. i sat to wait. he served 3 people who came in after me while i waited more than 15 minutes. i then asked if he got my order? he laughed rudely. \"you have to be standing in front of the cash register to order\" - he muttered in the rudest possible way. i was, apparently standing one foot to the right of the cash register. \"then why didn't you just tell me that?\" I asked, his retort was a grunt. \"Why would I stand here waiting unless I am waiting for an order?\" I ask. Basic grunts like an animal are the response. How simple is it to just say - in words - \"do you want to order something?\" Communication is so basic to running a fast food place. Why do I have to stand there and explain that??

Will NEVER EVER go back and will tell everyone I know to never ever go there. Treat people like absolute garbage and then laugh at you. Really Nice!"}
{"text":"Great place. Fresh food

I had the chicken plate and it's packed with the good stuff

Price is a little high buy for the portion you can tell why"}
{"text":"I would give this place ZERO stars but unfortunately Yelp only has a scale of 1 to 5. This restaurant just received its 8th failing pass inspection since 2013. I have ate here a few times, and am now downgrading my previous rating of 2 stars to 1 star. You would think after the last failing grade the owners of this place would have stepped things up, but no, they continued to prepare food in unsanitary conditions. I actually got sick here once but blamed it on my extra spicy order. If you value your HEALTH avoid this dump at all costs no matter how hungry you are or no matter how much you are having a  craving for Shawarma..."}
{"text":"This place opened in the same location as was previously Pita Mio.  I gotta say, it's an improvement!  I like the fact that there are a lot more topping options.  I especially like the lentils you can add to your chicken shawarma.  For under ten bucks you can get a good meal that tastes relatively fresh."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken shawarma here and the pickled beets are especially good. Went on Sunday for the great specials!"}
{"text":"I had a mean chicken shawarma sandwich with the works here. It was so tasty and juicy that I got shawarma goop all over my face and hands, but I just didn't give a damn. I then proceeded to mow down garlic roasted potatoes with extra garlic sauce cause I'm street like that. Very good stuff. I will definitely be coming here more often for my shawarma fixes. And that garlic sauce, I gotta ask them if they can hook an iv up and shoot it straight into my blood."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend today and got a beef platter. Wow it was the best beef shawarma plate I had ever had. I will definetly be returning from Mississauga."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I've never been a fan of Middle Eastern food. Very rarely do I eat a shawarma that makes my toe curl (just one in Boston). And now, pending my exile to Europe, I try to avoid things like kabobs and shawarmas knowing that they overflow the cities every turn you make.

Nevertheless, Liberty Shawarma, located so so so close to where I live, and I, being so so so lazy, have met begrudgingly. The decor is clean, being new and all, and the service is friendly. for $13ish after tax, you get a giant chicken shawarma entree plate that's piled with middle eastern dishes, like all that pink stuff, lentils, chick peas, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, radishes, potatoes, rice, and some coriander cilantro stuff.....it's not _cheap_ but it is a lot of random stuff for the price.

Is the food good? It's alright. The chicken itself was not anything special, but if you drench on enough mediocre sauce, it's palatable. The green spicy sauce is pretty good."}
{"text":"From the outside I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. This place makes a good gyro. I had the chicken and I could have made it two meals. Good value and good food. They actually stuff the pita instead of the more traditional \"Jimmy the Greek\" style flatbread taco. I liked it because I didn't loose the juices. 

Just as sure as I 'Terminated' that sandwich; I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I would rate this place zero if i could. I was over charged, did not receive the amount of sandwiches i ordered. On top of having to wait 30 minutes for my order, i had to wait another 20 for the missed orders. Staff was unbelievably rude!! No ketchup in the container on the counter, when i asked for some, the lady behind counter did not want to give me any. Little annoyances made my meal much less enjoyable."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken shawarma plate and it was huge!
It was large enough for 2 very filling meals. A pretty good deal for $12.
It came with a great garlic and hot sauce, and there was a variety of sides and garishes. There was so much food the lid of the container could barely close.

I heard the sandwiches are huge too, but luckily there's a choice of small or large unlike the plates."}
{"text":"Go there on occasion for lunch and order the chicken shawarma and have never been disappointed. Nothing exceptional but a good option for a quick reasonably priced bite."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but pretty bland. The person working was really nice but couldn't save the lame falafel - Same with the vegetarian samosa"}
{"text":"What a bad place to have a quick sharwarma! 

We got two chicken sharwarma which was a bad idea. We probably should have gotten one to try. To start, the server did not understand the order of two large chicken sharwarmas and a combo. My SO had to tell him multiple times and the server was frustrated too, he even confronted us saying \"I don't understand what you're saying\". 

We got our order and sat down promptly to eat it. It was badly put together, the vegetables were on one side and the chicken was on the other side. That was not the worse part, the chicken tasted like it was on the brink of being rotten and the vegetables tastes stale and old. 

The redeeming factor were the freshly fried fries that were covered with Cajun and salt though even that was done poorly. There were 3 or 4 with a lot of seasoning where the other ones were limited or none. 

I would not be going back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"came here daily for a month. Delicious. Chicken shawarma. What else? Parking issue but that's downtown for you."}
{"text":"This place just opened a week or two ago, and I gotta say, I'm a huge fan of a shawarma place within stumbling distance of my apartment. It's almost icing on the cake that the shawarma was excellent, but I suppose that's at least as important as location.

Being absolutely brand new, the location is very clean, with nice finishes. The layout is flipped from what I'm used to - order and pay at the cash register right at the entrance, then get the food part taken care of along the counter to the left. Most places I frequent are the reverse of that, so it threw me for a bit of a loop at first.

My first visit was a chicken shawarma with all the fixin's, plus hot sauce. They hot sauce wasn't unreasonable or unbearable as some can be, but definitely noticeable and tasty. The sandwich itself was very good, and a good size for the price, but the chicken was a touch on the dry side. Not a deal-breaker for me by any means, but I've heard others complain in the past, so be aware.

It's early days yet for Liberty Shawarma at CityPlace - I understand there's a well-received cousin in Liberty Village, though I've never been. I anticipate many happy returns, though, and will definitely update this review as those occur."}
{"text":"5 stars food is great but the service is wonderful! Chicken shawarma dinner plate will feed you for at least 2 meals. Super quick and definitely a healthier option"}
{"text":"When I'm neck deep in online work and realize I'm famished, but want to keep it healthy-ish, I often turn to Liberty Shawarma. Tip of the tiny hat to Uber Eats for getting these middle eastern sandwiches to my door within 20 minutes. 

My go-to orders are chicken or beef shawarma with extra tahini sauce and/or tabule salad and samosas. This food doesn't thrill me, but I like middle eastern and it beats Ali Baba's any day."}
{"text":"went to this wonderful place after a concert just down the street 
i thought it was a fluke that it tasted so good
i went back 
everything tastes very fresh and full of flavor 
extremely great pricing as well"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today and ordered shawarma dinner. The best thing is that I was able to park my car for free. They have two spots of their own.
The serving size was great!
All the items in the platter were flavorful. 
The person was very courteous.
Overall good experience"}
