{"text":"Best wings any where. We always stop here whenever we come to The Pittsburgh area. Staff is great as is the service!"}
{"text":"Our first but, not last visit was great! We took family with us for a quiet and comfortable dinner and that's exactly what we got. Very roomy tables. (i'm 6'4) The people are friendly,the food was great and the prices fair.We all had different meals. The wings,pizza,fish and hot sausage were all very good.  We live close by and wish we'd have known about them sooner. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yes their chicken wings are great. BUT. Parking blows! almost t-boned backing out. The light was so DIM and dark it was depressing. All the walls are wood its drab no color or light coming in. I took my kids there and they become unsettled quite quickly they went from smiles to tantrums and nothing about the ambiance was helping. The server was a bartender that didn't seem to actually like being a waitress. I would have preferred her to stay behind the bar, she was miserable, but who blames her she worked in a dungeon. The chicken wings were great! Everything else was normal bar food, nothing stood out and IDK if I will ever go back but do take out for the wings only instead. I wish it was more family friendly. If your with a girl friend or guy friend and just wanna slam down some beers and grub on wings its a good place. Definitely not a place I would visit again during daylight, but how much darker can it really get lol!!!???????"}
{"text":"Wings so large and tasty!  Excellent pizza. Great neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza, wings and beer when I'm in town.  Super friendly service and plenty of seating.  Try the homemade spicy wing sauce."}
{"text":"Stop here for food and a beer every once in a while. Good has always been good. Only thing is it is a little pricey. The wings are good and I love the gyros. The bar has cheaper prices than most other places around the area."}
