{"text":"This was our favorite lunch spot during our entire trip to Montreal.  The sandwiches were huge and packed with meat on incredibly soft bread, with lots of toppings available.  The espresso was fantastic and they even have imported beer and wine.  Really nice inside, quiet, plenty of seats and the prices were very reasonable.  Tons of handmade chocolates too."}
{"text":"Besides being convenient and close to the basicilica, we were actually pleased with our quick snack.  The pain au chocolate was great, the pastry was flaky and the chocolate was melted inside, mmmm, if only we got it when it came right out of the oven.  We also had a roast beef panini served on an olive roll with peppers, tomato, spinach.  The sandwich was premade, but still was pretty tasty after it was pressed."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the two lunch menu's and absolutely loved the food. My Sandwich and Soup were absolutely amazing and my wife loved the quiche.  I would highly recommend this place for the food. It's also right next to the Notre Dame Basilica which makes it a good stop when touring the old town."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Waited over half an hour for the omelet I ordered, and it was never brought out to us, despite 2 reminders to the waitress and cashier. Too many custormers they are uneqipped to handle. Unacceptable service for paying customers."}
{"text":"Delicious croissants and pastries. However, I went there to order a cake and had a terrible experience. Not so much with the cake, which I ended up ordering elsewhere  but with the service. I waited in line, like any customer, to be served. I only had a couple of questions which could have been answered in less than 5 minutes. She told me to wait on the side and somehow \"forgot\" about me. I ended up waiting 10 minutes while she served customers behind me. With every second passing I got more and more annoyed. I went back and told her if it was possible to finish serving me because I had waited in line, my turn had passed and I still wasn't served. Finally she came back to me and apologized but at that point I didn't want to do business with them. It took 2 minutes to answer my questions which were prices of cakes and types. I took my business elsewhere to a bakery which is far more customer service oriented and offer products that are just as delicious. My friend goes to concession to get pastries in the morning and the complaint is always the same: poor customer service."}
{"text":"Un endroit parfait pour diner ! Je travail près de ce restaurant et c'est endroit est l'option parfaite pour bien manger quand on est un peu pressé. Le service est rapide et la bouffe est très bonne !  Je vous conseil le comptoire a sandwich pour 10$ vous monté votre sandwich comme au subway ! Vous pouvez choisir jambon, poulet ou vege et vous choisissé vos légume et condiment. Par contre , leurs accompagnement sont de très grande qualité, oignon caramelisé, piment mariné, olive de differente sorte !   Avec cette sandwich vous devez choisir entre la soupe ou la salade et un cafe ou un the !   Pour 10$ c'est un repas parfait !"}
{"text":"We were waiting for the show at the Basilique Notre Dame de Montreal and realized we needed a bite to eat.  We found this little cafe 1/2 block away and were impressed with our first real meal in Montreal.  We both ordered the sandwich that the waiter explained as a kind of grilled cheese with ham and tomato and we split the carrot & raisin salad.  Both were so so so good!  The salad was the most delicious salad I've ever laid on my taste buds and the sandwich... perfect!  I would go back to Montreal for this little place alone(ok, not quite, but would be a huge perk).  My daughter felt the same way and loved the food.  We split 6 macaroons for dessert and they were also very good.    It was a wonderful first impression of Montreal dining."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place made the list of \"best pastries to try\" on some Chowhound list.   I was thoroughly disappointed.  The place itself didn't exude any charm, reminding me of one of those sandwich shops that caters to lunch crowds in Financial District (of San Francisco) that focuses more on timeliness than anything else.  I see locals on their lunch break working through their sandwiches silently and orderly, with newspapers in the other hand.    I didn't enjoy my latte, that tasted like instant coffee with milk.  My pain au chocolat was alright.  We ate in paper plates and cups despite the fact I had said \"it's for here.\""}
{"text":"Stopped by to get out of the rain. Arrived too soon for Centaur Theatre matinee show. They happily spoke to me in English and took my order for soup and a Croque Monsier. Very nice."}
{"text":"Une seule critique par une Montréalaise? Triste! Reprenons le vieux Montréal mes amis!  J'utilise ce bijou comme traiteur depuis quelque temps et j'en rafolle. La qualité de leurs sandwiches est super (le pain, le pain, le pain nomnomnom); et leurs plateau de fruits, fromages, crudités, etc. etc. sont extraordinaires. Leur chef (anciennement du Ritz on me dit) se serve que des fruits mûrs à point et, lors d'une évennement vin fromage dernièrement, les fromage étaient tous du Québec. Et le prix!!! Comme gérante du bureau j'adore bien manger pour un prix raisonnable, ça a meilleur gout!  J'aimerais en même temps adresser une des plaintes. Les chocolats ne sont pas faits sur place, c'est un fournisseur dont on m'a dit qu'ils changera. Aussi, si vous avez des plaintes ou des commentaires, demander de parler avec Jie, la propriétaire, qui est sur place d'habitude.  Only one review by a Montrealer? Tsk! Let's take back Old Montreal my friends!  I've been using this gem of a place as my caterer for some time and I'm in love with them. The quality of their sandwiches is great (the bread, the bread, nomnomnom) and their fruit, cheese and crudity platters are excellent. Their chef (once with the Ritz I am told) uses perfectly ripe fruit and, as with a wine and cheese we had recently, all the cheese was from Quebec. And the price!!! As an Office Manager I love eating great food at a great price - it tastes better! I would also like to address one of the complaints. The choclates are not made on site but by a supplier that I have been told will change. Also, if you have any complaints or comments ask for Jie, the owner, who is usually there."}
{"text":"This place was sort of fine, sort of lack lustre, sort of confused. I just wanted to sit and grab a coffee and turn my brain off for 15 minutes between meetings so I tucked into the first cafe I could find near me on Yelp. It took the waitress a while to walk over to me at the counter, she was sorta surly and the coffee reminded me of why I've been gradually turning into a careful coffee drinker (read: snob, I guess.) Tasting a bit of burning and a bit of stale, I drank a third of it and bailed. Reviews suggest the food might be yummy here, and the staff I chatted with on the way out were low key and friendly so I might find my way back here again, but then again, I have many other cups to sip, and promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep..."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and was immediately enticed by their grilled cheese on the menu. Sad to say that this sandwich was the epitome of mediocrity despite how beautiful it looked. But looks deceived. A lot.   There was a slice of ham between many of layers of cheese on a think piece of grainy bread. The top slice of bread had more cheese and herbs on it with a slice of sun dried tomato (maybe a regular tomato?) in the middle. The problem with the sandwich was that it wasn't prepared fresh. It tasted like it had been reheated after sitting in the fridge for a few days. Also, the cheese between the bread had not melted in the least. Now because I was in a hurry, I didn't have time to ask for it to be further heated and instead dealt with the dryer than should be sandwich.   The one redeeming quality was the coffee, which hit the spot and had great flavour.  The reviewer who called this place confused  nailed it."}
{"text":"This is a cafe and chocolatier located in Old Montreal.  I stopped in because I am chocolate fan and this had been recommended by a tourist I had met on the subway.  They sell the standard cafe food (sandwiches, soup, and I think salads) in addition to chocolates. I had a vegetable sandwich which was good, but not outstanding. I also took home a box of chocolates. (There was no way I was getting out of there without one.) They only make a small variety of chocolates (usually with some type of filling), but they are exquisite bite-sized chocolates worthy of your baby shower, dinner party, or loved one on Valentine's Day.  Either way, they are definitely something to share.  The chocolates are sweet without being cloying and each filling is a pleasant surprise that ranged from chocolate mousse to lemon to caramel to some type of maple.  And they are pretty to look at.  Out of a box of sixteen distinct chocolates, there wasn't a single one I didn't like. The decor is casual cafe and most patrons (most look like tourists) stay to linger over coffee.  Table space is at a premium, but you won't be crowded.  Beware, the prices are reasonable for the food, but the chocolates are sold by weight with the price on the steep side (but still worth a taste).  It's right down the street from the Basilica Notre Dame so it's near the Place d'Armes Metro stop, but still a bit of hike.  That said, I don't think this place is worthy of drawing patrons outside of those visiting or working in Old Montreal, but definitely worthy of a visit if you are in the vicinity and is definitely a casual alternative to the usual cafe fare in most tourist areas."}
{"text":"La Concession est un bon petit café situé près de plusieurs attractions touristiques Montréalaises. L'endroit fonctionne à la façon des grandes chaines américaines de café.  1- Prenez-vous un cabaret. 2- Faites la file au comptoir. 3- Choisissiez un sandwich, un café et un dessert en pointant ce qui vous plait par la vitrine. 4- Passez à la caisse pour une facture avoisinant une douzaine de dollars. Rien de bien nouveau.  La qualité est semblable à ce que l'on offre ailleurs dans ce type de resto. Les sandwichs sont très bons. Pour ma part, j'avais choisi une viennoiserie (danoise aux framboises) pour dessert qui n'était pas fraiche du jour. Un choix de menu du jour est offert composé d'un sandwich - salade - thé ou café. L'endroit offre quelques produits fin tels que des chocolats importés. L'atmosphère est quand même plus agréable que dans un café de grande chaine."}
{"text":"This was an accidental find for us. We came to Montreal for the day and visited the Norte Dame Basilica. While waiting for Mass we decided to have some coffee and found this shop a block away. We ended up ordering lattes and an almond chocolate croissant. First time I ever tasted a croissant so well made, it was crispy on the outside and so delectable and mushy inside, in every bite. Best croissant I have had thus far and recommend trying if you are in the area. Will be stopping by here again for some more. We also tried the raisin roll and it was very good as well. However, the almond chocolate croissant gets our vote."}
{"text":"Excellente sandwicherie/pâtisserie/chocolaterie pour manger sur le pouce. Belle qualité, très bon service. Livrent pour les lunchs de groupe au bureau."}
{"text":"Cafeteria informel, menu 10$ pour le lunch. Prix du vieux mtl pour le restant des produits."}
