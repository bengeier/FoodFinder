{"text":"I went there for dinner last month with a couple of friends. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. The service was excellent from beginning to end, and our group of waiters was friendly and down-to-earth despite the upscale setting, taking time to explain the different options and portion sizes. The starter pizza was good but nothing special, while the gnocchi were the best I've had in my life. The atmosphere is perfect: quiet but not excessively formal; trendy but not pretentious. I'll definitely be back on my next visit to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal at Chinato while passing through Cleveland this past weekend.  My wife and I split seafood cannelloni and gnocchi.  Each were delicious, but the gnocchi was particularly noteworthy - very light and simply seasoned.  Our salads and appetizers (marinated scallops and sauteed chicken livers with kale) were also well executed.  We tried the tiramisu for dessert at the recommendation of our excellent waiter Luke who convinced us that Chinato provided a unique spin on what is frequently a pedestrian offering.  Turns out he was absolutely correct.  In summary, a great dining experience and we are delighted to have randomly stumbled upon this gem."}
{"text":"Mussels, col bocca, and calves liver were all delicious. Excellent service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am a regular restaurant goer and have never written a review before because I never had a real reason to do so - while I like consistency I understand that all restaurants have good nights and bad nights and some dishes turn out better then others. They were my out-of-town customers and we were a party of 4. Overall the appetizers, salads, entres, sides and dessert were terrible, really terrible. The appetizers included fried artichokes, frito misto, sardines - all were served burned, really burned and were really over salted - they all looked the same on the plate and were almost inedible. The salad was arugala, raisins and jalapenos etc. also terrible. The rest of the meals were cabonnara, egg plant with ricotta, gnocchi, chicken something. The cream sause tasted like flour paste and flooded the pasta, The red sauce was not acceptable for an italian restaurant. The service was really poor and the waiter rarely showed. Surprisingly aloof, the waiter played lose-me throughout the evening and was not at all helpful in selecting the drinks, the wine, the menu even when asked. Most of the service was provided by other wait staff walking by the table and the manager. Overall, my one star was generous. I would rate the experience as perhaps the worst restaurant experience I can recall - a \"never again\"."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the staff are super friendly. I just think it's a bit too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner before an event at playhouse square.  Great atmosphere and food"}
{"text":"I am normally skeptical of Italian places, having grown up making my own pasta and grandma's red sauce.  That being said, Chinato is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  I had beef tongue appetizer and calf liver dinner (go big or go home right?).  The meat was incredibly tender, tasty, and any seasoning complemented the meat and did not take away from it.  The liver was not pasty and chalky like other livers I had - it was tender and moist.  Kudos to the chef."}
{"text":"I have lunch here on average once every other week, it is always predictably good. Starting with the bread which is addictive. But their best lunch is the brick flattened chicken. I accompanied it with the cold celery soup, which was near perfection. If you are in for some adventure the beef tongue is wonderful as well. 

I went to back for dinner this week and had the celery soup again with the tagliatelle pasta. All in all a perfect dinner. Who says business meals have to be boring."}
{"text":"I've been here once previously and I'd have given it 4/5. Some dishes were undercooked but overall great presentation and the dishes were well thought out. 

I called today for pickup, 35 minutes before \"close\" according to the interwebs. And...denied. Thanks for nothing.

If I Called 10 minutes to close, I get it. 35+? You're
Shitty. Or you should fix your hours."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I'm a very pick eater and the Tagliatelle and meat scared me with the beef tongue ingredient, but I ordered it and OMG it was so good! Definitely recommend this dish, very flavorful and a big portion as well!"}
{"text":"Authentic spirit, mediocre food.

The menu options are immediately eye-catching. Lots of authentic Italian dishes and jargon that will lead to most diners needing to ask questions or consult their smartphone. However, the food itself wasn't up to the standards the authenticity suggested. The fennel salad - which sounded like a traditional Sicilian salad but ended up being nothing like it - almost entirely fennel, only minimal olives, oranges and other goodies. The proportions were totally wrong. The arugula salad was \"fine\".

For entrees, it turned out less than half of the pasta dishes on the menu had fresh-made pasta, opting for boxed instead. This drove us to a cream-based pappardelle we didn't want in the first place - not big on cream sauces - and a pizza option that was underwhelming.

The service was fine, no complaints or celebrations here.

Not a bad place, but sets your expectations high before underwhelming."}
{"text":"We ended up at Chinato last night at the recommendation of my sister-in-law, who had been there once before.  Our party of six was seated immediately, sans reservation, (a big bonus at 8:00 on a Saturday night) in nice booth near the window.  The atmosphere is dark and moderately trendy, yet understated and nice, as one might expect from any E 4th establishment.

After ordering drinks, I had a nice glass of Shiraz, we all took a look at the menu (which is rather larger, but what Italian restaurant doesn't have a big menu?).  Unfortunately, none of us found the offers available with the restaurant week three course prix fixe menu interesting...they should really rethink that.  

Regardless, I started with the Fennel Salad, which was good, but I have had fantastic fennel salads elsewhere, and with a $10 price tag I think it left a lot to be desired.  I'm not sure if it was the dressing, or the fennel itself, but I couldn't really get that flavor that I am accustomed to when eating it.  One of my companions had the Tuscan Onion soup and it looked awesome, I would definitely start with it next time!  For an entree I opted for the 1/2 portion of the gnocci.  Oh wow.  It was buttery deliciousness!  Though, I do agree that it could have been a bit heavier on the garlic and little lighter on the butter.  But the gnocci themselves melted in my mouth, the texture was spot-on!  I had several forks other than my own diving in for a second taste!  The 1/2 size was perfect, though I'm sure I could have done a pretty good number on a full order...you know, if I *had* to...  We were all too full to order dessert, but I agree with others that the menu looked awesome.  

I have to mention that I found the service to be one of the best parts of my experience there.  Our server was very nice and attentive, without being overbearing, and he welcomed all of our questions.  Honestly, without him Chinato might have only received three stars from me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Plenty of menu options and a lot of great starters.  Warm atmosphere, great wine list, and amazing service. A nice take on Northern Italian food."}
{"text":"This was the place chosen for our LWED (Ladies Who Eat Dinner) meeting on Monday, and I left feeling pretty satisfied.

It's a little pricey, but falls into my category of classy (which is pretty much everything outside of dive diners and T.G.I. Friday's). The food was pretty marvelous -- not your traditional homestyle Italian, but inspired, nonetheless.  I tried a bite of everybody's entree, so I got good tastes of salmon, pasta, and beef brisket.  To stick to my budget but still round out a meal, I made a nice compromise by ordering an appetizer-size of the seafood cannelloni (which was somehow light and rich at the same time) and paired it with the arugula salad.  The salad was actually my favorite part.  It was crisp and green and just a little different, with pumpkin julienne and roasted turnips.  Splitting a bottle of merlot with the gals also helped to fill me up, just in case there were any concerns later of maybe not having eaten enough.

Since I saved on my entree, I allowed myself to indulge in the gelato selection and coffee for dessert.  The cherry and lemon gelati were much better than the chocolate.

We had very slight trouble getting the bill split correctly, but the situation was remedied quickly.  Our waitress was attentive and polite throughout the dinner service.

I'll probably reserve this place for special occasions only, but after a long day at work, it was just what we ladies needed.  Salut!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. It is, without a doubt the best Italian in the area, including Little Italy. The \"Col Buco\" pasta is probably the best pasta I've ever had and coming from an Italian family this says a lot. It is an orange sauce with big chunks of slow roasted pork shoulder in it.  It is perfect. Their garlic pizza is also probably the best pizza I've ever had. If you don't love garlic though, don't order it. The scallops are amazing as well and some of the best I've had. The beef in amarone over polenta is great too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of a couple fish dishes I've had there that weren't great. The tuna special was very disappointing and the Walleye was just average.  Everything else I've had is great. They also allow you to get smaller sizes for sampling for a cheaper price. The service is phenomenal and it has a great atmosphere. I would say that it's a top 3 restaurant in Cleveland and would recommend it to anyone especially for lunch where the prices are great!"}
{"text":"Having enjoyed lunch here several times, I picked Chinato as a pre-theater dinner destination on the Tuesday of Restaurant Week. The place was packed on a Tuesday night which added great energy to the place. Several things derailed the experience. First, the restaurant was out of both Malbec and Pinot Noir by the glass. Seriously? Open another bottle and sub it. But no. The boyfriend had the pork belly app and one of the pieces was stone cold. Ugh. My salmon app was completely tasteless shredded salmon in some kind of runny mayo based binder. Only took a few bites. The boyfriend's hanger steak on greens earned good reviews from him. My fluke was just OK. Nicely breaded but under seasoned by a mile. Some kind of mashed something accompanied it and some rock hard slices of beets. Now, the lemon polenta cake as outstanding. Really good flavor, nice texture. We loved it. The apple tart was warm and comforting with a nice chewy texture. Service was slow to slower and then slowest.

I realize there's a risk dining during Restaurant Week but I view it as an opportunity to showcase what a restaurant can do...in this case, not much."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 2 stars is due to their location and ambiance. I really do not want to write a bad review on this place because I feel it has great potential. For starters, our server was clueless when it came to the cocktail selection. However, I got really excited to hear they have blue cheese stuffed olives for martini's. The drinks were ok, nothing to brag about. The menu is pretty tough to understand. I really don't consider myself a food amateur, so I had a few questions for our server. I wasn't extremely hungry when we ordered dinner, so I went with something safe and light - a sopressatta panini. Little did I know that it was going to be served with 2 pounds of French fries. We went to eat with two other couples, one of which were really crazy about this place. They were pleased but I've had much better experiences both serving and eating wise. Until they improve upon the menu and servers, this place isn't going to get better than 2 stars from me."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner, attentive and helpful service. Col buco with shredded pork and the chicken saltimbocca were incredible. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is better than average.  Portions are tiny and overpriced.  The service late at night was terrible.  First, the server told us limited menu, then the general manager told us full menu, then the server came back and wouldn't let us order from the full menu.  THEN the kitchen staff came out & got waited on like kings.  Feels like Buenos Aires (Recoleta) inside & trying to be Italian, but no idea of how Italian restaurants really are."}
{"text":"We had a great time here. The staff is nice and attentive, the food was great. The prices are about $20 and up but it is worth it. Definitely fits in with all the nice restaurants on E. 4th. If you drive here you can get valet parking for $8, even on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I'm Italian, born and raised on the east coast, and I like to cook, so going out for Italian isn't something I usually do.  However, I've read good things about Zack Bruell and wanted to try lunch at one of his restaurants.

I had a reservation just to be certain I'd get a seat because I didn't know what to expect in terms of a lunch crowd on a Thursday at 12:15pm.  I was greeted and seated promptly; the restaurant was pretty empty.  I was in jeans, a dressy top, a linen jacket and casual flats and felt appropriately dressed for a midday lunch.

A waitress came to get my drink order.  She seemed a little spacey at first, but my confidence in her was restored when she took my entree order.  I ended up ordering the pappardelle with peperoncini and cauliflower and a glass of pinot grigio, a refreshing choice for the sticky weather outside.  The pasta was delicious, obviously house made and in a creamy sauce, a perfect lunch time portion beautifully plated.  It was accompanied by a delicious bread with great chew and olive oil to dip it into.  Lunch cost me $25 and I'd happily return for the expanded offerings at dinner.  I'm also planning to try another Bruell establishment on my next visit."}
{"text":"Excellent! Made a reservation for downtown Christmas lighting night. Server was helpful and attentive. My fiancee had a veal appetizer with noodles that was very tasty. Her entrée was the sliced tongue and I had the lamb shoulder. Both were exceptional and full of flavor. We repeatedly sampled each other's dish. The drink I ordered, first on the  list, was a 'real' drink, no filler. Paired well with my savory dish. Reasonably priced and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"To the untrained Clevelander's eye, you might think \"Eh, you eat at one E. 4th restaurant, you've eaten at them all.\"  For some I might agree (sorry 4th Street Bar & Grill) but Chinato? No way, Jose.  It's in a class of its own.

Chinato gets my official Dego endorsement.  This is the best Italian food I've ever eaten in my life.  It's not your traditional spaghetti and meatballs folks -- not even close.  Instead, this is mind-blowing, coma-inducing fare straight from my motherland.

I was fortunate enough to dine at Chinato with a group, so we sampled a number of items from the menu.  My absolute favorite appetizer was the Suppli -- deep-fried risotto balls.  In the words of Perez Hilton AMAZEBALLS.  They were crunchy on the outside, and creamy/cheesy on the inside, combining to create absolute perfection.  The wine list was also extensive and amazing; although I cannot take credit for our selection, a Brunello di Montalcino, I thoroughly enjoyed every last drop.  

Let me also say that dining at Chinato is an experience, not a meal.  To enjoy all Chef Zack Bruell has to offer, make an evening out of your visit and be sure to order every course.  Your tastebuds and  your tummy will thank you.

That being said, i started with the fennel and orange salad, finished with fresh ricotta.  I've eaten a lot of salads in my day (what female in her 20s hasn't?) and this is one of the best ever.  The right balance of crunch, sweetness and decadence, thanks to the ricotta, this had it all.  I then decided to go with a small order of the seafood cannelloni for my entree... big mistake.  I should've gotten the large!  The pasta was crispy, the filling was tender and meaty, and the sauce had a little spice that provided a great finish to the dish.

You also can't go to Chinato without ordering dessert.  I mean, that's the best part of any meal!  We sampled the chocolate hazelnut mousse cake and the lemon polenta cake.  Polar opposites, but equally delish.  Chocolate and hazelnut is pretty much the official dessert pairing of Italia, and Bruell nailed it.  The lemon was tart and sweet, topped with gelato, making me feel like I was at a trattoria in Roma, and not across the street from the Q.

Go to Chinato, that's all I can say.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I actually wish I could make it here more often. I used to work around the corner from here when it first opened and I really enjoyed stopping there and having a glass of wine and an app before I headed home. 

Loved the arranchini's app and the friend baby artichokes..so light and crispy with a side of marinara. My girlfriend loved the burrata because she lives in Italy for a few years. I thought it was ok but I don't crave it like I do the artichokes.

They have a small but pleasant patio on East4th to soak up the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service!  One of the best restaurants for Italian food I have been to in a very long time.  Definitely a place to come back to."}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland I was with a group of people looking for a restaurant on 4th St.  Chinato's looked like good place to eat but was I very disappointed.  I had the salmon entre and a glass of Cabernet.  The salmon was extremely salty and the dish was more a soup than I had expected. I was expecting salmon, beans, spinach and a few other ingredients on a light plate.  So the dish was not great.  This is the first time I paid $21 for a soup that was advertised as an entre.

The cabernet was excellent but pricey at $12 a glass. 

Won't go back to this place next time I am in Cleveland"}
{"text":"I've been to Chinato twice, for lunch and dinner. Overall, it's a really, really good restaurant, although maybe not a great one. I'm glad it's in town and with any luck, it will become an institution like Lola across the street. 

For lunch, I had the sausage pizza, which was pretty good. It's not an earth-shattering coal oven, guy trained in Naples, crust is so light you need to weight down the pie pizza, but it was pretty damn good. 

I went for dinner with my wife and family the night after Thanksgiving. We had a variety of apps and salads, signature cocktails, wine etc (that ended up being kind of a crazy night) and most of it was pretty to very good. A couple of misses: the mushroom salad that was basically a bowl of mushrooms and the tomato soup that was strangely akin to a bowl of chunky marinara. My brother had the liver, which I didn't dig, but if you are into organ meats and offal, there are several items that contain various parts and pieces. The tongue app was really good now that I think about it. 

Service the both times was good, efficient and friendly for a business lunch and attentive and informative for dinner. 

If you have the means, I would most definitely recommend Chinato..."}
{"text":"Salumi plate appetizer was great. Aside from that, I've had better pasta (and service) at the Olive Garden. I would consider returning for a happy hour, nothing more. Expected a much better experience."}
{"text":"I went last night and sat on the patio. The atmosphere was great, the service was spectacular from the hostess seating us, our server, our bartender who made a drink that was not on the menu, the food runner, and the person who filled our waters and bread.Service says a lot about a place and although it is a bit more expensive, it is totally worth it.


I ordered was great. I had the scallops with potatoes. The Scallops were cooked perfectly, but could have used a bit more seasoning. The greens it came with might have been my favorite on the plate with all the flavor and textures. The potatoes were good but there was quite  a few of them and I didn't get to finish.

My friend got the Gnocchi with basil and tomato. It was cooked perfectly and almost melted in your mouth. Very creamy, buttery and very flavorful. Everything was brought to us at the perfect temperature and it really made the evening pleasant. 

I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We are new to the Cleveland area and Chinato is one of the reasons we LOVE our new hometown.  I was staying at a hotel downtown and would walk to 4th street on most nights to eat dinner.  Once I discovered Chinato, my husband and I ate there at least twice a week.  The atmosphere is refined and modern but not stuffy and service at the bar is about the best you'll find anywhere.  John is the BEST!  The crudos are DIVINE, the cheese course is a DELIGHT (especially the way it's served) and the pastas are FANTASTIC.  There is a wonderful food scene in Cleveland and Kack Bruell is a key part of it.  A must!!!"}
{"text":"We were not overly impressed with Chinato.  Our server(s) were not very attentive and our main server smelled like she was chain smoking in-between visits to our table.  We ordered the antipasti platter, which was just OK.  Our main courses weren't bad (I got the ravioli and my husband got linguine with clams) but they weren't anything special - not a lot of flavor in either.  The same goes for dessert - not bad, just nothing special.   

Though it doesn't reflect the restaurant itself, the valet service available across the street was painfully slow and unorganized (we waited over 15 minutes for them to retrieve our car)

We probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the tomato bread soup, but my gnocchi had very little flavor. The sauce was a bit watery and it needed something. Maybe it was an off day. I'll try it again, but I would try other things."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!!!!! Wish I could give it 0 stars.  My cousin had the basement reserved for 2.5 hrs after her wedding (deposit paid).  We showed up late only to find that the place was closing down!!! The manager had sent all his staff home! WHAT?!?!? Who does that??? Would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Went this past sat night with five of my girlfriends. The atmosphere is really pretty and private but kind of loud if you ask me. Our waiter was awesome and it's probably the best service I've had in a long time. We ordered two bottles of pino noir and our glasses were never empty! I ordered the tomato bread soup which was pretty much marinara sauce with some basil and fresh Parmesan, not what I was expecting. I guess from the title \"bread soup\" I expected croutons of to be severed with bread?? I ordered the gnocchi which had a cream sauce that I could have drank! The gnocchi was extremely filling so order a half portion if you order anything prior to the meal. We finished with the tiramisu which had orange liquor in it so it tasted like orange which I prefer the traditional way but it was still tasty. I'd definitely recommend and return just for the service alone!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. Waitors knew the menu well and were easy to converse with. Relaxed atmosphere and seemed well attended even for a late Tuesday evening.

Two of us got pasta dishes and one got the crab cakes. The cakes were great. The gnocchi and ravioli with pork,etc were delicious as well.

Our one compliant was that the pasta dishes were exceptionally oily. My wife and I are less than a year married and she is going to school, so we don't eat out much but rather cook almost every meal at home. I suppose we are just used to eating healthier. I could have sautéed mushrooms in the leftover oil at the bottom of my wife's gnocchi takeout container. Yeow!
The upside to this is that the small servings were vastly more filling than they appeared they would be at first glance.

Valet parking service was fantastic (10 second walk to the restaurant) and ended up being cheaper at $7 with voucher from restaurant than the $15/20 event parking for the Cavaliers game."}
{"text":"I have spent thousands of dollars at this place but every time I go they have several tables available and tell me that I have to wait for a table. Unless you have a 5 carat ring on they won't seat you. Total discrimination. Very sad."}
{"text":"It's Zach Bruell Restaurant Week until 1/25, and for $30, their prix fixe menu can't be beat.  You chose from three offerings for appetizer, first course and dessert.  My mushroom bisque, a fabulous pork entree and luscious dessert made for a lovely dinner.

Top of the line ingredients and presentation plus a superior wine list make Chinato a date night treat.  

Our waitress was fabulous; the second and third string servers have good intentions (your bread plate and water are never empty), but they lack polish.  Our forks were nearly knocked out of our hands several times as they reached across diners to serve and remove.  

Chinato was definitely a hip destination.  The decor resembles L'Albatros, another of Bruell's restaurants. 

I like."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here, and very much enjoyed the cheese plate, wine selection, zuppe de pesci and the chicken.  Great service and good atmosphere.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A belated review for one of my new Cleveland favorites...   Chinato is innovative Italian, a la Zac Bruell.   I went here for restaurant week, somewhat halfheartedlly, thinking it would be a overpriced mediocre celebrity chef restaurant, but alas I was wrong.

Our food was uniformly wonderful - I had the salt cod, and arugula salad and the most wonderful cheesecake I've ever had.  You need to understand I do not say that lightly.   I am not a dessert fan, but this, and all the other desserts I've tried here, were wonderful and for these alone I would go back again and again.  My dining partner was similarly pleased with his meal.    The only criticism, which is as everyone has mentioned, is the food is salty.  I love salt, so for me it works.  If you don't, I wouldn't go."}
{"text":"Well executed.  Appropriately portioned & spiced.  Attentive service.  Would definitely revisit.  Stewed squid starter was exceptional."}
{"text":"My wife and I started with the artichoke appetizer.  It was delicious and a great start to the evening.  She ordered the braised beef and polenta and I ordered the Col Bucco. The braised beef was unbelievable.  It just melted in our mouths.  The Col Bucco was overly salted but still very good.  This was our first Zach Bruell experience, and we are now looking forward to trying his other restaurants.  For dessert we order the Lemon Polenta and Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse Cake.  They were both excellent.  Our waitress, Michelle, was excellent and very helpful with recommendations when asked.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chinato is one of my favorite spots to dine in the Cleveland area. I enjoy everything about this place. The food is fabulous, atmosphere is modern and chic, and the location is perfect. My only complaint is the event staff. They were very unaccommodating and rude when I was trying to plan an event here which was very disappointing. Outside of that experience this restaurant is amazing!"}
{"text":"Chinato puts the same emphasis on decor and ambiance as L'albatros. But the overall feel/look is much different. Chinato feels modern, yet cozy and intimate, yet airy. I loved the openness and soothing color palette.

The menu carried the same authentic charm.

My friend Jenn and I wanted to sample of variety of Chinato's offerings. If you are trying out a restaurant for the first time and want to sample it ALL, go with my method: a little bit of this, a little but of that  

We ordered an appetizer, starter salads, a side, soup and a \"small plate\" version of a pasta entree (I love that Chinato offers this figure-friendly portion!) 

We started with Jenn's selection, the Suplee, pan-seared risotto balls with fresh mozzarella cheese. Balls of heaven. These crunchy morsels held cheesey, gooey goodness that had us saying \"mmmmmmmmmmm\" and \"nomnomnomnom!\" I tried to limit myself to just a two- we had a full meal ahead!

Next up, arugula with julienne of pumpkin, roasted turnips, pumpkin seeds, goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. One of the main things I was looking forward to in this salad was the PUMPKIN. Unfortunately, there wasn't much of it. I was expecting more of a pumpkin punch! Although I suppose others might find my typical love of pumpkin a bit too intense, so subtle may have been the right route to take.

For my main \"meal,\" I enjoyed the Ribollata, a dish explained as a \"minestrone-like stew.\" This soup was delicious! I couldn't even count count all the veggies! Jenn and I both couldn't believe how much flavor was packed into each bite! I have GOT to try and get some details on this recipe next time I'm at Chinato. I think the key is cooking the pork and letting it get all nice and smoky before incorporating it into the soup with the roasted veggies.

Jenn was kind enough to share her main dish with me: Gnocchi with tomato, basil, toasted garlic, butter and parmesan. wowzer! Best.Pasta.Ever. No joke. And I live in LITTLE ITALY! This gnocchi was sensational. Each pillowy noodle melts in your mouth and sets your taste buds into overdrive. I'm quite impressed that I was able to stop myself from grabbing the dish from Jenn and inhaling it in all its buttery glory.

On the side, Jenn and I both loved the white beans I ordered. These were seasoned with parsley and were so simple and satisfying. I didn't think a side of white beans could be so delicious... And the presentation was adorable!

Jenn and I both agreed that it just wasn't right to judge a new restaurant without ordering dessert! The Tiramisu was fantastic! I loved the nutty layers of breading/walnut and how they complimented the light cream so nicely.

But as amazing as it was, it didn't hold a candle to the delicious Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse Cake. When angels cry, I'm certain it's because they ran out of this cake in heaven. Seriously."}
{"text":"Our first time here! Our server, Blake, was knowledgeable and friendly and made our visit memorable! We had the calamari and antipasti, both absolutely delicious. The restaurant itself is beautiful too, and all of the staff was really on top of things. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Chinato during restaurant week with some friends. The fixed price menu was amazing!! I had the cod and my friend had the beef tongue. 2 of my other friends ordered off the regular menu and both of them had excellent food as well. The 2 people who ordered off the regular menu paid the same as the people on the fixed price menu and the 2 of them got a first & second course along with dessert. The 5 of us shared a bottle of wine and the total for each person came to about $45.

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hmm. 2 bugs.  One on my bread serving and another on my menu.  General manager couldn'd care less.  YUCK!   BUGS!!!   Bill came to over 400+ and no adjustment until our guest argued while we were getting our car! WTF!!!!  Over priced and bugs!!!!!  Stay away!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Enough vegetarian selections. Italian place, and you get what you expect. I don't think it's exceptional as an Italian restaurant but it's okay."}
{"text":"I was in town for work for the day and a colleague brought me here for lunch. 

Nice ambiance, understated but comfortable.

The food was very nice, we split an octopus salad which was quite delicious -- very thinly sliced octopus which I believe was simply poached and served over arugula with a light oil and vinegar dressing.

My host ordered the gnocchi, and when I saw porchetta on the menu, I knew I couldn't NOT order it.

The gnocchi were superb, I'm used to a heavier dumpling (which I think are more Argentine than Italian), but these just melted in your mouth, and were served quite simply in a butter sauce with parmesan and sage.

I'm used to porchetta being Roman street food, as a sandwich. This was a slice served over a bed of wilted greens (perhaps broccoli rabe, but with the stems mercifully removed). The fillng was the usual rosemary, garlic and other herbs. The drawback to me was the fact that the fat surrounding the roast was pretty thick, and a bit hard to discern between the muscle. My first bite was mostly fat. Once I figured it out, though I was able to trim the portions before taking a bite. The meat itself was nice and tender.

An espresso rounded off the meal. I dislike the trend of serving single shots in a demitasse . . . it doens't look chic, it looks cheap. Fill the cup!

I thought service was polite, if a bit unpolished . . . if the aim is to try to redefine Italian away from the much-maligned (but to me beloved) Southern model of red-lead sauce, meatballs, lasagne, and the like, the menu should be perhaps a bit more descriptive (and avoid using the \"EVOO\" abbreviation if you want to be taken seriously) and the staff trained on the basics of standard Italian pronunciation! The restaurant isn't called \"CHEE-nato,\" it's \"kinATO,\" and both my colleague (a full-blooded Italian) and I paused when the waiter repeated my order as \"porch-etta.\" Mamma mia!"}
{"text":"Sooooo bad. Hair in food. I ordered some linguine that was supposed to have seared scallops on top. This had some small thawed out mush in it. Waaay too salty. The soup of the day was like a thick mush stew. Had a bite of my friends food. It was way too salty as well. They are trying to create flavor with salt as opposed to real, natural, authentic ingredients. I am absolutely not a fan. Go to Olive Garden. They have more flavor than this place."}
{"text":"Excellent! Always walked past this restaurant and wanted to go.  My husband and I made a reservation for a Saturday night dinner because we weren't sure how crowded it would be. Around 8 o'clock wasn't too busy. Our server was quick, friendly, and very knowledgeable on the menu and gave us great suggestions. The sweet potato soup was fantastic, as well as their pizzas. Atmosphere is modern yet intimate. Would definitely come back, great place!"}
{"text":"Was there last Thurday night, 7 July, with a young friend.  The ambiance was very nice.  The hostess greeted us warmly and the servers and Mike, the manager, could not have been any nicer.  The brews were cold and nice.  I had a Duvell.  The appetizers, radishes and olives were not expensive and were very tasty.  My friend had the braised pork dish, shoulder if I recall correctly.  It was much too salty.  Whoever prepared it used a heavy hand, not good.  I had the chicken dish, it was properly seasoned and well cooked.  Sadly a bit too well cooked which left it a bit on the dry side.  The seasoning of the chicken was much better than the seasoning of the pork.  Despite the less than great pork, the service was just flat outstanding.  If I go back, I will specify less salt.  As far as dress, it is a very casual place."}
{"text":"We dined at Chinato with a business associate this week. The men both ordered the Restaurant Week special whith the Hanger Steak. The steak was cooked at the appropriate temperature, and it tasted pretty good; it seemed to be lacking spice or a distinctive taste. I had the mushroom salad ( delicious) and the appetizer portion of creamed cauliflower pappardelle. I really enjoyed the pasta, and I am so grateful they offer the tasting portions.

The drinks were very good, especially the unique Caprese martini. The service was fantatic, and the menu was pretty affordable. I believe we would make a return trip, thou L'Albaros is still our favorite in the Bruell group."}
{"text":"Loved their happy hour! The Gnocchi is the best I've had so far. 4 stars only because I can't justify giving a 5 star after having only tried the happy hour menu.

The bartender was also super friendly and fun to chat with. Looking forward to going back for happy hour, can't quite afford their regular menu..."}
{"text":"Food was simply blah at first the appetizer was served with the salad?????The mushroom salad was nice and fresh but the fried baby artichokes were over fried and like eating mulch. Our entrees took forever (thought oh good they'll be fresh and hot)when they came out the we're cold WTF sent back not paying these prices for cold food. The manager brought out a complimentary arrachinii (fried rice balls on sauce!? Not that good we've had better at olive garden) my wife's bread was soggy and smelled like lemon?? When the replacement entrees were served they were okay ( of course Pipping hot) but the ravioli tasted a little under cooked and my blackened cod was warm (very small) All in all our dinning experience was very sub par servers standing around cook were all just standing back there BSing not a professionaly run place I water like 15 min to get a water refill and that was after we had to ask for it. Will not return to Chinato and I hope Zak Burrells other establishments are better and this isn't setting the precident."}
{"text":"This was my second trip here.  We went for a later Saturday night dinner.

I love the décor of this place.  The modern Italian feel right on East 4th works so well.

I appreciate the fact that they have been good with reservations. They seem to book appropriately so diners can be sat on time and enjoy themselves for a full experience. The service has been great.  As with all the Bruell restaurants we have tried the servers make it feel like a special experience.  The water glass gets filled, the bread replenished almost immediately.

I also love the fact that there are beers on tap.  A few good local options too.

I had the salmon with peperonata and farro.  A fair-sized portion, it hit the spot.  In my first trip I had the veal breast which had really stood out to me.

So the food, atmosphere, and service is easily 4-5 stars for me. Really good!!! But the bathrooms have been bad... Pretty damn bad.  I usually don't knock a place for something like a subpar restroom but it's been something that stuck with me after each visit.  They are nice, spacious, restrooms in basement but boy have they been gross.  Urine and garbage on the floor, and just generally unclean.  In this last trip someone had vomited all over- and the hostess said it had just happened, but man, nasty.  I get it, it's on East 4th and they can't control everything but the rest of the place is too well executed for this. 

I'll be back though.  With a bottle of bleach... just kidding, hopefully it's just the small sample size of my visits."}
{"text":"This is an after the fact review and I don't recall exactly what I had.  That's how memorable the meal was.  The food was good, but not great.  I remember thinking that I would go back to Lola any day of the week instead of Chinato."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all!! First of all the service was terrible. Our server seemed like he did not want to be bothered with our questions about the menu. Needless to say we ordered a three course meal with salads, appetizers, and then our entrees. They all came out at the same time!!!! There was no room on the table and the server again could not care less. On top of this, the food was bland and for what you got for the price it was way to high. I work in fine dining, so I get some people are impossible to please, but I felt after this experience I needed to say how unimpressed we all were."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the risotto and my friend had the vegan sausage with corn pasta. They were both very good and you could not tell the sausage was vegan."}
{"text":"I visited Chinato for a late dinner on Friday with a group of 7.  The ambiance of the restaurant is nice, and the service was good.  We were all laughing at how quick they were to refill our bread actually, even after we had told them we'd had enough.  They were good at refilling the water glasses quickly also, and I was pleased to see that all 7 entrees arrived at the same time and no one said their food was cold like it had been waiting for the other's to finish.

I had the peach/basil julep drink, which was good but expensive.  For dinner I had the stuffed swordfish with olive paste, my husband had the whole roasted chicken, and we shared a side of the creamy polenta.  Everything was nicely presented and the portion sizes were good.  My entree was very good, and the others at the table all liked the sauce that came with my husband's chicken, although he didn't like it much himself.  He liked our polenta, but I thought it was runny and tasted too much like dairy and not enough like corn.  A couple people at our table were unhappy with the lack of vegetarian selections on the menu.  They ended up getting the gnocci and said it was very bland and were disappointed with the amount of tomato in the sauce.

My biggest complaint about this restaurant is with the menu.  It's terrible.  We are a well educated and well traveled group, but there were just so many words on the menu that we were unfamiliar with.  When there are a few new things, it's nice and you feel like you're learning and it adds to the experience.  But when you're with a semi-large group and you all want to ask about 3 or 4 items, it's just too much hassle.  We used our phones to look up a few things, but gave up on the rest.  The other major problem with the menu is it's lack of descriptions of the dishes as a whole.  Even for things that were easy to understand, like the whole roasted chicken my husband ordered, you're forced to ask what it comes with (potatoes and greens) because it's not listed.  For someone like me who often chooses a dish based on the sides, that's a huge deal.  And I'm not going to ask about 5 or 6 entrees when there are 6 other people waiting to order.  If we were dining with just 2 people and I was trying to choose between 2 or 3 dishes, it wouldn't be as big of a problem.  

Overall, the service was good and there might be dozens of things on the menu I'd love, but unless they change their menu I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Cleveland many times and Never tried Chinato until about a week ago.  Living in NJ/NY I figured \"What's Cleveland know about Italian\".  My girlfriend and I stopped there for a very early dinner before the Alternative Press Music Awards Show.  

We started with the steamed asparagus.  If this was any sign of how our meal was going to be, we were off to a great start.  

We then shared a half order of the Pappardelle with creamed cauliflower, pecorino and pepperoncini.  This was one of the most spectacular pasta dishes I've ever had.  Extremely flavorful and a really light sauce.  We are making our attempt at recreating the sauce this weekend!

For the entree I had the Chicken Scallopine which was simply amazing.  I'm not even someone who eats fennel yet I cleared my entire plate.  It was a perfect dish.  

We were very concerned about eating Italian and feeling bloated before a late night out and that didn't happen.  We were full but not bloated.  Everything was absolutely perfect.

In addition our waitress (Annie) was spectacular!  I don't recall the last time I had such a  nice, fun, attentive and simply awesome waitress!  Chinato should be VERY proud to have her as an employee!

I will be back next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Chinato has been really hard for me to review. I'd say it should probably have four stars at least by \"objective\" and/or \"foodie\" standards. However, it wasn't my type of place. This is just my opinion!

I am really into old-school, old-fashioned, traditional Italian restaurants. Chinato is modern in decor, menu selection, and presentation. The menu is very electic and almost bordering on ridiculous in a way. There's a load of tongues, livers, and at least one if not two items in each section that I have never even heard of. Not to say that the adventurous type should not partake. But it's a little too esoteric for an \"everyday\" type of dining experience. I could totally see the cast of Top Chef being asked to cook here and use only the kitchen's ingredients. Putting it simply: they don't have lasagna, spaghetti and meatballs, or chicken parm here.

I don't mean to sound like a bumpkin, nor do I wish to complain about Chinato in the least. Everything was very elegant. We were treated very well (however, since they were busy, drink orders took much too long to come out - even just a sparkling water, which I asked for 3 times by 3 different people before finally getting it). We had a large group for a business dinner and they accommodated us nicely (of course, make a reservation, even on a weeknight).

The portions were a bit small, too. The salad was great, but pretty much the size of my palm. The half-orders of pasta were truly half-sized, if not smaller. I was a bit disappointed in the tomato/basil gnocchi because it seemed to be drowning in butter and oil, with just a finely shaved sprinkle of basil and a few teenily-diced tomatoes.  

Ok, maybe I AM complaining (sorry). It's just that if you want your thick, red sauces, your big hunks o' meat, and your bowls overflowing with pasta, this isn't really the place for you."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a 2 at best but I gave them 3 because they tried. Service was slow, but it is a busy Saturday night and we went before a Justin Timberlake concert so the place was packed. However, they are located within walking distance of the Quicken Loans arena so they should have known better and staffed appropriately. That was least of my worries. Almost everything we ordered was over salted, from the mussels, calamari, lobster couscous, pizza, all too salty. Pumpkin salad was different and unique and definitely not oversalted."}
{"text":"I have always heard mixed reviews about this place but I had a fantastic experience. I may have a biased opinion though because I went with someone who used to be a waiter there full time. He was able to tell my date and I all about the menu and his best suggestions for the items we were thinking about ordering. 

I have to admit I am lacking in knowledge in the Cleveland Italian Food department. I tend to eat all other cuisines far more often. 

We started our meal with a Fennel Salad, Octopus Salad and Arancini (called something else on the menu). The arancini were some of the best I have ever had! I was even using the sauce to dip my bread in! They were light and cooked perfectly. The salads were also very good as a 1st course. 

For my main entree I ordered the Sea Scallops with pisarei, brocolini and lobster sauce. Oh my! The lobster sauce was so good! I couldn't get enough of it! I was also dipping my bread into that! The scallops were seared beautifully and paired well with the lobster sauce. My date got the special and while he thought it was fantastic it was the priciest thing on the menu (we have learned our lesson to ask about the prices on specials)! 

We each tried a dessert and while the lemon dessert has great gelato on top the cake part is so dense and pretty terrible. The Chocolate mousse though was great and I would recommend that to anyone who loves chocolate. 

Overall it was a great first time dining experience."}
{"text":"After dining here on a Saturday evening it was clear just how popular this place is. It's even a little difficult to get a reservation. At first, they told us they were booked solid. The day before, they called us back and advised that they will get us in, as previously requested. 

This place was pretty fancy. At least on this night, everyone was dressed in their best. The service was formal as well, from the moment I arrived I noticed that. I prefer somewhere more down to earth and less formal, but it definitely made for a special night. One thing that I don't particularly care for is how close the tables are to each other. So close, you could hear and smell everything from the party next to you (I know this because someone ordered a dish with truffles and it smelled divine).

I ordered the scallops, served with roasted potatoes and escarole. Let me just say, when I smelled the aroma from my neighbors dish, I wished I had ordered that. Don't get me wrong, best scallops award. That's where my happiness ended. The potatoes were bland, literally no flavor at all. I didn't even taste salt, butter or garlic, nada. And the escarole was difficult to eat. Not worth the calories and too much lemon (something I thought I would never say). Next time, I will order pasta.

Very nice ambiance, decor and scenery. All in all, if I had enjoyed my sides I would undoubtedly dubbed this restaurant with 5 stars. For now, just know that this is one of the more exquisite restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Probably the best nouveau Italian place in Cleveland - the mussels with fennel were perfection.  From there was the arugula salad and col busso.... Wow!  The layers of differing flavors and the beautiful presentation, not to mention a really special wine list were just incomparable.  Reminds me of some of the better places we visited in New York and Napa.  Love you, Chinato!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner. Appetizer was super tasty and gnocchi was super creamy. Service was what you would expect, decent enough. Overall I would go back."}
{"text":"Great dinner at Chinato after the tree lighting! The high point was the rabbit puttanesca on garganelli pasta. Delicious flavors of rosemary, olives and capers accented mild and tender rabbit in tomato sauce served with perfectly cooked pasta.  Or was the high point the perfectly seared scallops with crisp semolina gnocchi in that sumptuous lobster sauce (we wanted a bottle to take home!)? Our server, Brooke, was fresh and attentive, even on such a busy evening.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the food was delicious! We started with mushroom polenta which we enjoyed. Our kids also enjoyed it so much we ended up ordering extra. We had gnocchi , pasta, octopus dish and lamb shoulder. The dessert was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"The spicing of the salmon dish is superb.  So tasty, not bland at all.  Wonderful."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Zack Bruell's restaurants in the past and this one is no exception.  My wife and I came in at 7PM on a Thursday.  Yes, do make a reservation.  The restaurant was full as expected.  A bit noisy for our tastes but we loved the decor and overall atmosphere of the restaurant.  Be warned, this is no Spaghetti House!   You won't find spaghetti and meat balls here.  I ordered a Walleye with a potato which had salted cod in it and my wife had a braised beef with Amarone.  We loved them both.  We shared a chocolate dessert which disappeared too quickly.  Our bill was just over $100 which included 4 nice sized cocktails.   Aside from the noise, the restaurant deserves a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I am not happy!
Here is a not so nice update to my review. I want to preface that this review is not about the food, but about the management. 
 You see I come to this resteraunt quite frequently. Tonight was my last time. 

Sadly, a server inadvertently spilled a tray of iced tea all over my husband. Believe me, I used to to be a server so I completely get that this sort of thing happens and that it is an accident. I'm not blaming the server. It was how the entire incident was handled afterwards. 

After my husband had several iced teas spilled on him, he was soaked. We were on our way to a Cavs game and now he was completely drenched. He would be destine to remain that way for several hours. Imagine sitting in a wet shirt and pants for an evening. To make matters worse, he had a pretty expensive shirt on. Not just a run of the mill shirt, but one from the fancy French house of Hermes. A gift from me that he is wearing for the first time. This concerned me because tea does stain. I am not sure if it will come clean, as its cashmere. Dry clean only.  We are potentially out a VERY expensive shirt that may not be able to be worn again.  

The server was apologetic, and then pipes up, \"at least it's not wine,\" His opinion was totally not helpful. 

While I tried to help my husband clean himself off, an argument between us began. Without getting into details about that... I'll just say it was about the fact that he was soaked. Dinner was silent. My husband and I are fighting and the kids are on edge. My husband is wet and I'm totally mad.  Not my idea of a nice family dinner. 

Finally my husband decided to leave the table to buy a Cavs shirt off the street. At least the top of him could be dry. He is missing for 15-20 minutes of our meal. He spends $27.00 for a new shirt. 
Our meal is in silence. We finish our awkward meal and ask for the check. 

At this point the check arrives, it is more than $200. My husbands mood escalates. To this point, nobody from management had even come to check on the situation. Other than the server, there were no apologies or acknowledgment that our dinner and probably our evening were ruined. We have a damaged expensive shirt, spent $27.00 on a new one and now are spending another $200 plus tip for a dinner that my husband missed half of because be left to buy a new shirt. 
 I ask my husband to allow me to talk to management and explain how we feel. All I can say is \"wow!\" I'm not a pain in the butt customer. I like to give people a chance, so I proceeded to explain how our evening went. 

When I mentioned that my husband had a tray of drinks spilled on him, he responds, \"oh yeah, I heard about that.\"  Really? You heard about that and never said a word to us at the table? As I continued to explain more, I defiantly got the idea that this guy could care less. 

I told/showed him the expensive shirt, he says, \"I'm not up on my fashion labels. I don't know what that shirt is.\" 

I tell him that the tea may stain, he says, \"I doubt that!\"

I tell him my husband went to buy a shirt, he says, \"oh.\"

 I finally asked, \"can you at least take care of this?\" I handed him the charge slip for the $27.00 shirt, he chuckles, \"oh, sure I'll get this from petty cash.\"  It was almost chastising, as if I was wrong to ask for the money for the shirt. I thought to myself, this guy outright doesn't care. He proceeds to run and grab me $27.00. At no point does this guy say sorry, or offer me anything else. 
Truthfully, considering how bad of a time we had at Chinato, and how bad my evening was about to be, I expected a little more than a $27.00 refund. 

At no point did this manager ask for my name. I think this might be handy, just in case I call you about this incident.

At no point did this manager give me his card or even offer up his name. During our conversation, he was clearly too busy and uninterested in taking to me.

Did you file an incident report? Will anyone even remember that this occurred? 

I'm a middle aged women with a decent amount of life experience. This is customer service 101. 

To the management of Chinato, I have no idea if you even read these reviews. I would like you to know that you get your last $200 from me tonight. 

Yes, I think someone in management should have acknowledged the incident. I do believe I should have been offered something, even desert or a glass of wine... Something for the inconvenience.   
Instead you decided you didn't care, were far too busy, or you lack complete common sense. I even came to you for the opportunity to make it right, you didn't. Congratulations, your superb management skills lost you a customer."}
{"text":"had dinner with the wife for the second time here in 3 years and again a failure and doubtful will be back any time soon..our server was great and informative at the beginning and helped us order appetizer and main courses.. the problem was our main course..be AWARE of the SEA SALT.. I ordered the seafood cannelloni and it's was probably the SALTIEST dish I have never tasted in my lifetime...NOT the one to complain but I HAD TOO.. just that bad..our waitress informed the chef/manager and never introduced himself and said that it was very salty and mentioned the reason was that it depends who is cooking in the kitchen..I thought to my self what.?? what's going on back in that kitchen.?! waited for another 20 minutes for a remake and did NOT enjoyed our dinning experience.. at least they could have bought me a dessert for the inconvenience and for ALL THAT SEA SALT.. BUT nothing.. our waitress disappeared and no sorry or dessert or anything to make us want to come back...I guess I have to know when and who is cooking to expect NO SEA SALT on my dish.. OR no worry and enjoy a good dinner and dinning experience when you have LOLA or Green House Tavern etc. as you next door restaurants...."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple and it gets better every time!!
This restaurant has it down pat. The service was amazing! Every time the servers have been attentive without being annoying and chatty without lingering. The manager is always around overseeing everything and helping out. 
Every time we have asked servers for their opinions on their favorite dishes and we have taken their advice - so glad we did!! So far I think their brisket and swordfish were our faves. Yes, swordfish - it was delish! The flavors they put together are to die for. You get a great value for your dollar here. I will even say I think they are under priced. 
This place is one of my faves in the city - when we guests in town, we bring them here!"}
{"text":"We were going to go to Lola's across the street for the whole celebrity chef thing but went here instead. 2 adults and one child. Great atmosphere! Our server was beyond excellent! He helped us choose some wine and made some wonderful menu suggestions as well as accomodating our 4 year old son. We tried to tongue and it was fabulous! Our salads and entrees were divine. Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great experience top to bottom.  For a Wednesday night it was packed so I was glad I made a reservation.  I was surprised by how big the menu was... Nice variety above and beyond Italian.  My girlfriend and I split the arugula salad to start.  Perfectly seasoned, perfect temperature, and awesome flavor.  Impressed.  We also shared some type of biscuit and purée appetizer.  Also delicious.  I ordered the half order of house-made gnocchi and my friend  ordered the half order of shells.  My gnocchi surprised me a bit... It was swimming in butter.  It wasn't exactly what I had in mind but it was good.  Then I couldn't resist the dessert menu.., ordered the tiramisu.  While not a super traditional version... it was flat out damn good.  The orange flan was incredible.  Service was 5 stars."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time tonight before the Cavs game. We started with cocktails, which were both great and the fried artichokes, which was a good choice. They were very light with a refreshing lemon zest. We had a difficult time choosing from the extensive menu, but with our server's friendly help we went with the olive stuffed swordfish and the skate. Both were incredible and perfectly cooked and seasoned. Our server Kara had a very comfortable but professional demeanor, and provided great recommendations. As someone who can't eat without beverage I was very grateful that there seemed to be two staff members dedicated to refilling water! Also, bonus, they refilled our bread. The only things that could make it better would be having warm bread, some spices in the dipping oil and the downstairs could use a little warming up. All in all, a great experience though."}
{"text":"Best bar in Cleveland! You must ask for Kyla the best bartender around! She has the best product knowledge and can absolutely recommend the right drink for you according to your taste preferences."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to the late-night happy hour last night on a whim. I was so impressed! It was one of the best experiences I've had out in Cleveland. It's pretty rare when every single person that serves you makes you feel comfortable and welcome. The host who seated us (guy) was very warm and the bartender (girl) checked on us frequently even though we were in a booth. A server came over with bread and olive oil, which you can sprinkle with Himalayan sea salt (just use a pinch, it's really strong). We both had the drink of the evening (vodka with blueberry juice and seltzer and lemon) as well as a glass of Merlot. Each drink was $5. We split the happy hour gnocchi and the Margherita pizza. The gnocchi was so creamy and the quality of the Parmesan really took it over the edge. The Margherita pizza had a perfectly crisp crust and the plum tomatoes were very flavorful. It was seriously some of the best service and food I've had in Cleveland. Even the guys who came to fill our glasses of water were particularly nice. It's amazing what a difference good service makes, and this restaurant does a great job of being upscale without being snobby or pretentious. I'm definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Chintano is a great spot to eat in Cleveland. I was passing though and thanks to Yelp found this gem.  We started with the mussels...some of the best I've ever had.  If it were socially acceptable I would have had the extra sauce wrapped to go.  Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive.  The Col Buco dish is a must!  Perfectly cooked and sauce brilliantly manufactured.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food: I rate the food at a 3.5/5. For appetizers, we had the tuna crudo, fried artichokes, and mussels.  For the entree, I had the grilled octopus. For desert, I had the orange caramel flan. The majority of the dishes I had (and sampled various others that are not listed here) were solid. However, none of them were stellar. I also had issues with some of the dishes I ate. The fried artichokes were extremely tough to eat and I nearly choked on it. The grilled octopus was also drowned in a rosemary marinade that overwhelmed the subtle grilled flavor of charred octopus that is so unique. The octopus was also placed on a bed of greens that were overly dressed in a very acidic vinaigrette. Sometimes less is more!

Service: No issues here. The hostess was pleasant and the wait staff was attentive.

Atmosphere: Chic and vibrant.

Overall: While I hesitate a little to rate this place at a high 4/5, I love their willingness to offer unique and daring entrees, such as beef tongue and octopus. Playing it safe with steak and scallops is so boring! While the execution on some of the dishes could use some improvement, I am coming back to sample more of their dishes."}
{"text":"I had read good things about this place so we decided to give it a try for my birthday. Our server was great, she answered all of our questions and was extremely knowledgable of the menu. She recommended different entrees and drinks based on things we had said. A lot of people recommended the gnocchi as an appetizer and let me tell you it was AMAZING. It was so good we ate it all before I could snap a picture. I would probably order it as my entree next time I enjoyed it so much. My boyfriend ordered the braised beef with polenta which tasted great. Very flavorful. I ordered the veal breast. Our server warned me ahead of time that it was a rich piece of meat, and not too lean. I ordered it anyways and let me tell you she was spot on. Don't get me wrong it tasted fantastic and I liked it a lot, but it's definitely something you have to be in the mood for. Will definitely go back to this place as there were a lot of appealing things on the menu. Overall I'd say this place has a more contemporary style of Italian food instead of the classics you would find in little Italy."}
{"text":"This was a fabulous meal! We were seated within view of the kitchen and my friend noticed that Zack Bruell was there. As he was pointing him out to me, Zack noticed and walked over to say hi. Later he sent over a complimentary appetizer that was risotto balls rolled in parmesan, toasted, and served with marinara plus the deep-fried artichoke hearts. Both were delicious! I definitely recommend both.

Our table ordered ceasar salads that were crispy and tasty and the mussels. Main dishes were the \"pasta\" special of the day (thick slices of squash with baby beets and carrots, parmesan or romano cheese, and a light broth sauce. Sooooo flavorful. I would definitely order this again), striped bass (cooked perfectly), and pappardelle that my companion raved over. We sampled a variety of wines throughout the meal, all of nice quality. As far as I'm concerned, this is a must visit place in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This used to be excellent. But my last four visits have been horrible. Not that Zach Bruel has semi-retired, his son is not in control. I have been served polenta with the consistency of water. A server with a brain, would be expected to look at it and not bring it to the table.
Prices are strong but the product has fallen way down with no signs of reclamation."}
{"text":"Upscale Italian food at its best! The meal we had here was surprisingly delicious and your usual Italian choices. I had a perfectly prepared brick flattened chicken breast that was scrumptious. The tomato and bread soup was very good, too. We got here on a Saturday night at about 7:30 w/o a reservation and were surprised to get a table immediately. I don't know why this place wasn't more packed. Maybe because it's at the end of 4th Street, but it's definitely worth eating here."}
{"text":"We visited Chinato in February this year and it was really quite good.  With the exception of some salads that were out of balance, the overall experience lived up to the expectation that Zach Bruell's restaurants should.

If you go here, make sure that you get the burger.  It is off the hook.  And be prepared to be confused by the menu- the waiter will have to explain a lot of the dishes to you."}
{"text":"Not many people take the time to write down an excellent review, but my boyfriend and I will do just that!!! I've been here several times with my boober, curtis and his family and we have ALL enjoyed the selection of great foods... never disappoints!! We will continue to come here every chance we get!! Service is wonderful and one thing I really observe is seeing if my water is always filled, and it is!!  Love the wine selection along with the beers.Great job to the cooks and staff!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was all the build up, but I was disappointed.  
I liked the modern atmosphere/decor and thought all the servers were very professional and pleasant, but I thought that it took an extraordinary amount of time to get our drinks and even our food.  I expect service to be a little slower at an upscale place (I definitely want to savor my expensive meal), but all in all our meal took about 2 1/2 hours.  A little too long for me, especially when I'm hungry!
I was pleased with my pasta selection, the gnocci (who can go wrong with a bunch of butter on some pasta).  I got the small portion and it was just that, small.  I then split the beef brisket with a friend.  I'll have to say i was disappointed in it.  Flavorless.  
One beef I have with this place is it is very citrus-focused.  Both the tiramasu and cannoli's had citrus in them.  Yuck.  The roasted chicken was also infused with citrus.  It would have been super tasty if I liked citrus, very flavorful.  I'd recommend it for citrus friends.  
All and all it wasn't bad, just not as good as I was hoping."}
{"text":"Not good, not good at all.  I had the buratta risotto.  It was soupy, not creamy at all and they put huge hunks of parmesan cheese on the top which were just gross.  They were thick and completely took over the flavor.  My friends' dishes were no better.  The bolognese was greasy and, wait for it...covered with huge slabs of parmesan cheese.  The brick chicken was not good either especially covered in slabs of parmesan cheese.  Was there a sale or something?  Had the food been good, the prices would have been quite reasonable.  The staff was great, all very friendly and attentive.  It's just the food... It was not good."}
{"text":"Finally got here for dinner after passing by it numerous times and wanting to stop in. We went for restaurant week and had a fabulous time.
Pros
The service is top notch. 
The food is creative and delicious, rustic Italian themed.
They have an extensive wine list.
They have smaller sizes of pasta if you want to mix and match.

Cons
Wine list is on the pricier side (but worth the value)

I'd definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the mood for great food, relaxing ambiance and exceptional service."}
{"text":"I didn't get to eat here. I was in from out of town,  had had a really long day and thought I'd drop in for evening dinner after sauntering through the 4th street restaurant area and surveying the menus of the other establishments. Shockingly, the hostess was visibly annoyed that I didn't have a reservation and she grudgingly offered me a seat at the bar or a table \" downstairs.\" The stench from her bad attitude was repulsive. I further add that there were other customers and staff in the area so it was a bit embarrassing to boot. She made me feel as though I had done something wrong. I left the establishment  with a bad taste in my mouth which did not come from the food - which I had looked forward to eating based upon the number of positive yelp reviews."}
{"text":"OMG, Cleveland is really stepping their cuisine game up, and Chinato doesn't disappoint. I ordered the beef with creamy polenta, and it was simple, but extremely good. Well seasoned, beautifully prepared. ZB, has struck gold!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for a birthday dinner. Definitely a nice quiet place to bring a group of people for Italian food. Menu was easy to understand with the help of the waiter, recommended good dishes for multiple people at the table. Food came out relatively fast which is  always a plus. I definitely plan to explore the menu more next time."}
{"text":"One of the best places for lunch on East 4th!  I was slightly skeptical of Chinato at first, but I have never been so happy to be proven wrong! 

The place has a modern, bright decor with a touch of old world- similar to his other restaurants.  It's a nice meshing of both styles. Their booths are pretty comfy too! 

The service was slightly slow for lunch hour with plenty of bread to fill the time between ordering and receiving our food.  But, not as bad as some other places on East 4th. The olive oil that they serve is ridiculously fragrant and tasty with the seasoning salt! 

One of the best pasta dishes, I have ever tasted is the col boco with shredded pork in a tomato broth.  Pasta was perfectly al dente and absorbed the flavors of the tomato sauce.  The pork was tender and scrumptious, adding to the dynamics of the col boco.  The tomato sauce is a bit more liquid and thin, like a nice warm tomato soup, but 1000x times tastier.  I can't wait to have another trip there to get the col boco!! The light grating of fresh Parmesan just pushes the dish over the top and it's a wonderful explosion of deliciousness.  It reminds me of warm comfort food that you would want to eat on a chilly Fall day or when you don't feel well.

The only downfall to the dish is that it's slightly pricey for the portion that you get.  It's definitely filling, but you can spend a good chunk of change just for lunch."}
{"text":"I really wish I didn't wait so long to review this place.  It's been over a month since I went, and my review not going to do Chinato justice at this point.

I've been dying to try Chinato since it opened.  I went to Italy in January and have been searching everywhere to find a restaurant stateside that even remotely compares to true Italian cuisine.  HAving heard so much about Chinato, I had a feeling this would be the glimmer of hope in Ohio, but it took me months to finally pay the place a visit.

My wonderful boyfriend brought me here to celebrate my 26th birthday.  We spent a good three hours in the restaurant trying every morsel of food we could possibly stuff into ourselves.

We began the evening at the bar, where we had their cocktail of the day.  I can't remember precisely what was in it, but wow was it good.  While at the bar, we also ordered the Salumi Plate, which while good, was still just a mixed assortment of cured meats.  Delicious, of course, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We also ordered the Buratta with grilled toast and cold tomato basil sauce, which was devine.  So creamy and delicious and elegantly prepared that I began to feel nostalgia for Italy.

Once we were seated at our table, the real fun began.  We tried a variety of wines and the sommelier was beyond helpful.  I was in search of a sweet moscato and mistakenly ordered a dry moscato instead.  He was kind enough to swap out my glass for something I enjoyed more....and at no cost.  He actually went hunting in his wine cellar for the perfect wine for me, and he succeeded admirably.  I was very grateful for the attention he gave us.

We tried a variety of dishes and were not disappointed with any of them.  First, the boyfriend ordered the Grilled Sardines with olive and parsley salad.  While not a shining star, it was still a solid option.  I opted for the Involtini of Eggplant stuffed with ricotta and shrimp, which was heavenly.  The eggplant was thinly-sliced so as not to be too overpowering in flavor, and the ricotta was fresh, rich, and creamy.  The shrimp were difficult to locate, however.  For main courses, we tried the  Col Buco with slow roasted pork shoulder, tomato and white wine, which was out of this world.  The boyfriend and I split their appetizer sized portion and it was still more than enough.  The pork was cooked to perfection- moist and flavorful.  The sauce was delicate enough to let the flavor of the pork shine, but still delicious on its own.  This dish definitely won us both over, but to the boyfriend, it was the highlight of the evening.  We also tried the appetizer portion of the gnocchi with tomato, basil, toasted garlic, butter and parmesan.  I am ALWAYS disappointed when I order gnocchi.  Until Chinato, I could never find a restaurant that gave gnocchi any justice.  But at Chinato, I was absolutely floored.  After the first bite, I had to put my fork down and just take a minute to savor what I had just eaten.  The gnocchi retained their traditional delicacy while still being powerfully flavorful.  Hands down, my favorite dish of the evening.  I could have ordered 5 more servings of it.

The boyfriend ended his meal with a gelato sampler, which was true gelato, another rarity in this country.  Each selection was full of flavor and the perfect texture.  I chose the Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse Cake, and I could have died and gone to heaven after the first bite.

I think we both gained 10 pounds that night (party because of the delicious bread they kept bringing us throughout the evening that we couldn't say no to!), but it was so worth it.  Chinato has usurped Greenhouse Tavern and Lolita as my favorite restaurants in Cleveland.  I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Zack Bruell, and his restaurant L'Albatross is my absolute favorite.  We were only able to go to Chinato for their happy hour, and haven't been since (due to a lack of time).

It's a cozy Italian restaurant, with a balance between modern, sophisticated decorations and an antique feel. It was a bit of a wait to get a seat, but that's expected during any happy hour. The drinks were very cheap, as was the food. The portions weren't too bad either. When I went, the vegetarian offerings during happy hour were sparse, so I had ordered the pappardelle as well. The pasta was perfectly cooked. Overall, it was a great time with appropriately priced options for a happy hour. Their normal menu did look a bit pricey, however."}
{"text":"Today was the first day Chinato offered lunch, so I went there with a few friends from work. The menu is pretty extensive, and fairly authentic. The restaurant serves things like beef tongue, oxtails, calf liver, etc along with gourmet pizzas, paninis and pasta. The drink menu looks pretty good too. Next time!

For lunch, we tried some of the pizzas, the pappardelle pasta, the canneloni, and the mussels. The food was delicious! My only qualms with the place are these: they did not bring you a bread basket - and although it's nice to have a waiter come by and serve you bread piece by piece, it gets a little annoying if he keeps bringing bread to people who don't want more and then not bringing bread to people who do want more. They might want to rethink the bread basket-less idea. 

Further, the dishes were all pretty small - from the pizza to the mini canneloni entree! I might not have thought much about this, seeing as its an upscale place (which seems like it might tend towards the smaller, gourmet portions, BUT the waitress prefaced our food by saying that all the portions were \"pretty hefty\" and a good size. So we were all expecting a little more sizeable than the mini salad, mini canneloni and small, thin crust pizzas. 

Overall a good experience - just dont expect big portions for your money."}
{"text":"My husband took me to Chinatos on Saturday, April 28 for my 50th birthday.  We came about 20 minutes earlier than our reservation.  We had a drink at he bar.  Bartender was very nice.  We were seated about 30 minutes (10 minutes past our reservation) but we were enjoying the drinks at the bar.  Our waitress Michelle was very nice and informative.  We did not feel rush or hurried at all.  I order the Arugula salad for starters and then I had the Skate fish.  The salad was one of the best salads that I have ever had.  My mouth still waters thinking about the salad.  My fish was very yummy as well.  My husband had the chicken legs and they were awesome.  We are still talking about the chicken legs.  They were moist and had no bones.  They did bring me a dessert for my birthday.  This dinner was unbelievable!  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  We will be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"From out of town but my wife and I have been here twice now and both times exceptional. Interesting menu. Not the usual red sauce and meatballs but somewhat imaginative menu and they deliver with the flavour. Got the polenta with wild mushrooms to open and it was creamy and the mushrooms had punch. My wife had the fennel salad and was very refreshing and light for a hot summer day.  She also had the carbonara. Done very well and they used guanciale, not pancetta, as used traditionally in Rome. Prefer smaller chunks (too much for her but not me) but the taste was just right. No onions, cream or peas! Love it. 
I followed with the seafood cannelloni which was light but lots of flavour and rich. Perfect portions. My wife finished with the lemon polenta. Great!  
The bar made a very refreshing lemonade that cooled me off instantly. Nice service. We have not been disappointed hope they keep it going."}
{"text":".. definitely on the \"pricey\" side but the food is worth it. 

I highly recommend an appetizer portion of the gnocchi, the limoncello & the brick flattened chicken."}
{"text":"We couldn't get a dinner reservation at Lola, by Michael Symon, we we ended up here for dinner.  The place was not busy for 7:45 on a Saturday, which is always a concern to me, but I let it go and glad I did.  The service was a little on the slower side, but not awful.  My husband and I enjoyed  an Italian onion soup, similar to French onion, but the onions were puréed, it was delicious.  The bread service was a delightful homemade ciabatta.  I enjoyed an amazing homemade pasta with a cauliflower purée, it was sooooo good, I almost could stop my self from over eating.  We skipped dessert and opted to go to Mortons for An after dinner drink and dessert as it was closer to our hotel.  Overall, a great pick when in the downtown Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I decided to try Chinato during Cleveland Patio Week. While the meal was good, service was quite mediocre.  We were seated in the lounge (the Patio Week deal) and either felt completely ignored or at the service of an overbearing waiter, like he was compensating for not being available for most of the meal. Once seated, we were given water and bread promptly, but our waiter took several minutes too long to make an appearance at our table. He finally came by, said he would be right back and then more time went by. Eventually what may have been the manager came to our table to take our drink orders. When the waiter was at our table, he was pleasant and was able to give us opinions and descriptions of the menu. 

I ordered the arugula salad, baked cod, and lemon polenta. The salad was good, fresh, and creative. The cod was cooked well, but very bland. The sauce on top managed to give it some flavor, but was drizzled sparingly. The dessert, after being recommended by two staff members, ended the meal on a nice note. The polenta was dense and flavorful and topped with a lemon ice cream, that was perfectly tart but too sweet for my liking. 

Perhaps the service and food would have been better in the main dining area or off of the patio week menu. Even if this was the case, there should be no reason that the food and service shouldn't be consistent throughout the restaurant. There was nothing memorable enough about the meal to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"I'll be darned if the E 4th street area in Cleveland doesn't have more quality joints crammed into a city block than many major cities have in their entire downtown area. Chinato may not seem like the hippest or trendiest kid on the block, but its dishes certainly rise with the tide of culinary excellence sweeping the city.   We tried three dishes at Chinato at the end of our restaurant and bar crawl, and came away feeling like it may have been the best stop on a tour that included Lola and Greenhouse Tavern.  The raw scallop \"crudo\" with extra virgin olive oil and lemon zest, a sashimi-meets-italian kind of appetizer, came out wafer-thin with a melt in the mouth texture.  The homemade gnocchi with butter, parmesan, basil and tomato, a shining example of comfort food done well, was our entree option (I wish all gnocchi were like this: small, misshapen, chewy bites tossed in a minimalist sauce with a few accenting ingredients.  Only 10 bucks for a generous half-order!)  Tiramisu was our choice for dessert.  The tiramisu preparation opted for a ladyfinger \"wafer\" between two layers of mascarpone creme rounded out like a mini cake, rather than the traditional layering of individual cookies with creme poured over the top.  Light and not too sweet; a nice riff on an old classic. 

Overall, Chinato left us feeling like we ended things on a high note, and that further trips to the eatery would be mandatory.   Greenhouse Tavern and Lola do wonderful things with their eclectic, all-over-the-board menus; there are times, however, when the palate craves places like Chinato, whose gastronomic identity is still very much grounded in the comforting and familiar flavors of a national cuisine."}
{"text":"We made a last minute decision to go on a Friday night. It was great that the place didn't have a wait. The atmosphere was very glassy but there was no dress code - some people came in with t-shirt and short while others came in nice dresses. Basically anything goes.

To start, we ordered a salmon crudo (raw fish, kind of like sashimi). The mix of raw salmon mixed with other items (onion, orange slice, etc.) is just perfect. For main course, we got a whole roasted chicken and a beef tongue.  Our food took FOREVER to come..and when it finally came out, the waitress told us she messed up our order and ordered a completely different chicken dish. It was pretty disappointing after such a long wait, but she was really nice about it. She gave us the choice to either wait for the kitchen to make the right dish OR to keep the current chicken entree and she'll pay for it. Since we've waited so long, we decided to just take the dish that's already there.

Beef tongue was pretty tasty and it was very tender, and they were not shy about using oil. The outter layer is crunch while the inside is soft. Overall, definitely a good dish to try. The chicken dish was decent, but it was on the dry side. To apologize, the waitress also bought us a free desert - chocolate hazelnut mousse cake - which was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. There's a little surprise in the center of the cake too.

By the end of the meal, we only had to pay for the ceviche and the beef tongue. She didn't charge us for the beer, chicken entree or the dessert. Since she was so nice about this whole mess up, we tipped her 50% and decided we'll be BACK to give it another try. The food overall was pretty amazing. I'd give it 4.5 just for the service!"}
{"text":"I was really excited for my meal at Chinato, but it turned out to be a-ok. 3.5 stars for this restaurant. I would be interested in coming back to try other dishes if a friend really wanted to go.

We came here to treat a friend who was visiting in town. He is a lover of Italian food, and after one look at the menu, he knew it was legit. I hear Zack Bruell really tries hard to make his meals authentically Italian.

Service: 5 -- Bruell's restaurants are always run very well. Our glasses were never half full, we were offered bread whenever our plates ran out, and they were very interested in making sure we had a good experience. My one issue is that our server wasn't as knowledgeable about the menu as with Bruell's other restaurants. She had to go and ask others for more information.

Ambiance: 4 -- really great ambiance and fitting for E 4th St. Lots of modern lines and decor, and lots of fairly well-dressed people coming in for dinner after work.

Food: 3.5 -- I ordered the spaghetti with seafood - a simpler dish, but I was really looking forward to it. Very simple flavors with the seafood and tomato. I would say that the salt water broth was the best -- really great combination and good flavor, but it wasn't very deep. The pasta wasn't particularly moving or fresh. 

My friend got the gnocchi - very popular at the restaurant, and he was very satisfied. It was restaurant week, so my beau got the prefixe which included the tuna tartare (I think), the vegetarian cannelloni, and a dessert. It was very average. I would say go with the gnocchi."}
{"text":"We dined here after going to Lola the night before, and that probably wasn't quite fair.  We were a little disappointed in the decor (plastic chairs?  Concrete floor?).  We were seated downstairs, but I didn't notice that the upstairs decor was much better.  There was no \"warmth\" that one would expect with an Italian restaurant.  The \"industrial\" feel only serves to make it difficult to have a conversation.  We had a lovely server (Emily?)-- she knew the wines and helped choose one that we all enjoyed.  The food was pretty good-- arugula salad, seafood, and pasta dish with sausage all fine.  I do like that you can order a smaller size entree-- that's a huge plus.  Not sure I would return- not enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"There are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options at this restaurant, one of the chic-est places in downtown Cleveland.  Our polenta was rich and creamy. The pasta came with a light cream sauce that showed off the cauliflower. The chocolate cake was dark but a little too dry.

Overall this is a great place for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.  It's a romantic spot for sure."}
{"text":"Great menu and good service.  I would go back for sure.  The apps were delicious.  Sat in the bar area which was fine because they had football on the tube."}
{"text":"While the service was top notch, the food was nowhere near that. Tuscan Onion soup was OK,  so was buratta with  camponata. Radicchio salad was so bitter that my wife couldn't make it past the first bite and my shaved mushroom salad had a burned aftertaste. For the main course I ordered braised beef with polenta and roasted mushroom - while beef was fork-tender and very good, polenta was extremely mushy and felt more like polenta soup that had mushrooms in it. My wife decided to go with a fish for her main course  - fluke with artichokes,  fennel and tomatoes. She indicated that fish was cooked well but the tomato red sauce overtook everything on the plate. Since we were there as a part of large birthday party, we brought our own cake, therefore were not able to try the desserts. 
Overall, somewhat of a disappointment. This is my forth restaurant visit for Zack Bruell group and the most disappointing."}
{"text":"Reserved through open table. 
We happened to make the reservation on game night: Cavs versus Spurs. They totally jacked up the parking. We parked further away and got one for $15. Factor in parking.

It was a pretty busy place.  A bit too noisy for me, but it was a game night and the place was bustling.
It also happened to be restaurant week.

They start you off with bread and olive oil.  The guy just plopped them down on the plate. Hurried would be a way to put it.  But, not really a biggie.

I got the Prix Fixe menu for $33:
Started with the: \"Butternut Squash arancini with brown butter/sage aioli.\" To be honest, one of the best appetizers I've had. It's full of flavor.  I never had Risotto in a tasty ball form like that. I'd give the appetizer alone a 5 star rating.
The entree : \"Seared Pork tenderloin with pancetta, roasted sweet potatoes, oyster mushroom, port wine reduction and and almond gremolata.\"  I thought the pork was pretty tasty.  It went well with the sweet potatoes.  I wasn't able to eat much of it because my girlfriend didn't like her dish, but I'll get to that later. (Wahhh)
Dessert: \"Espresso panna cotta.\"  I liked how it was on a stone slab.  I felt quite like the ancient Roman/Italian culture by eating it like that.  It seemed basic and ancient. But, in a nouveau like ancient times sort of way.  I enjoyed the espresso centerpiece gelatin.

My girlfriend got:
Crudo: \"Tuna with tomato coulis, speck, micro greens and sea salt.\" It was delicious, you have to make sure to get a good amount of everything in one bite. My girlfriend said she tasted the fish, but I didn't. At best, very mild fishy aftertaste.

Entree: \"Chicken legs \"saltimbocca\" style.\" She didn't like it.  The chicken was juicy.  The soup it was in had a southern feel to it. Collard greens? grits?  If I had to say one thing about it, it tasted like it had too much ginger in it. It wasn't bad. The quality of the food was good. But, it was gingery and bland, if you can taste that visually.

Overall Impression:
I liked the atmosphere, the interior design is great.  Parking was an issue.  But, the food was good overall for me to try it again. I'd go back, but probably next year's restaurant week."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were in Cleveland for the weekend for our anniversary.  By chance, ran into some old friends and decided to try Chinato.  They were booked but were able to fit us in.  That being said, we expected to be rushed but hoped the food would be worth it.  The entire staff, including the bartender,  was wonderful!  Not rushed in the least and the food was superb!  I have ZERO complaints and would definitely go back... and this is after dining at the Lola the previous night!  Cleveland has some really fantastic restaurants and Chinato is one of them."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Only came for happy hour so shared a few different appetizers and drinks with friends but it was amazing! We enjoyed the eggplant mozzarella app, sausage pizza, and cheese board (could have used a few more slices of cheese but still delish). My martini was great but the blue cheese stuffed olives were lacking, and maybe that's just me being a martini snob. I cannot wait to come back here for dinner!"}
{"text":"Chinato holds it's own with all the excellent dining options on East 4th street. Great location anchoring the southern end of East 4 street within easy walking distance to the Q,Jacobs field, Pickwick and Frolic and the rest of the downtown entertainment locations. 

The menu options are upscale Italian not your typical local red sauce pasta restaurant. We started with some wine, a Rose' for my wife and I went with a nice chianti, both served by the glass or bottle. We both quickly agreed on the Stewed mushrooms with smoked mozzarella as our appetizer and OMG was this good. Tasty, creamy with a mushroom woodyness that I almost ordered an other portion for my meal.

Tearing ourselves away from the appetizer my wife went with the Blackened Cod and I had the Braised pig cheeks with bacon polenta. The Cod was both visually good looking and well prepped. The pig cheeks with polenta was a delight. The checks were fork tender while sitting on a bed of creamy polenta. Needless to record - we did not have dessert after have seriously large lunch."}
{"text":"The escargot was to die for!  Gnocchi could've used a bit more seasoning in the broth/sauce. My husbands scallops were very tasty! Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Best Bruell of them all!

The only negative about this place is that it's located in that bastion of trendiness:  East 4th.  Being located on East 4th does give it a certain...reputation.  It's cool though, Chinato.  I know you aren't like those OTHER restaurants.  You're class, class, class all the way, baby.  

This place does Italian in a new and exciting way.  I've never been so excited for pasta in my life!  This isn't your run of the mill, little Italy fare (don't get me wrong, I love me some little Italy).  This is the gooooooood stuff.  This is creative Italian cooking at its best.  And trust me, it IS the best.  I went with a large group of six of us and the service was prompt and outstanding.  Between all of us we feasted on chicken and pasta and scallops.  Oh, the scallops.  I LOVED the scallops.  I'm currently in the middle of moving downtown and it'll take a feat of incredible will to stop me from making obscenely frequent visits to this place."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to give this place a 4.5, but alas here I am stuck deciding between the full sponsorship of a 5 star review, and the understatement of a 4 star one.  At the end of the debate, I realized that I would gladly replace any Italian restaurant in Austin with Chinato, so here it is, a fiver.

First, I had the involtini of eggplant.  It was perfection- a blend of very thinly sliced eggplant, the creaminess of ricotta and the chew of the shrimp.  

Second, I had the gnocchi.  It was good, but didn't blow my mind as others have discussed. I felt the garlic could have been heavier and the butter lighter.  Perhaps it was just a bit too plain and heavy after the light and tomato saucy involtini.  Either way, this came in 3rd of my 3 courses.

For dessert, I had the Lemon Polenta Cake.  Now here's where they really blew my mind.  I'm not a lemon dessert person.  Cookies with lemon flavor get thrown away,  lemon tarts and other citrusy desserts like key lime pie are never choosen.    The waiter recommended it so I thought OK, he was right about the eggplant so I'll give it a shot.

OH.my.gosh.  I couldn't stop.  The polenta cake was to die for and the lemon sorbet/ ice cream?  was bright and light.

An hour later I'm still crazy-full, and crazy satisfied."}
{"text":"5 people. Thursday evening. 2 months of expectation building up inside of me. Let's just say that I love food, and have been hearing about Chinato for a long time. In fact, I had 3 chances to go previously and all fell through somehow. That may have been a message from fate. However, I was so excited to taste the food!

Chinato is a modern, upscale, fine-dining restaurant situated in Cleveland's E. 4th Street micro-district. Zak Bruell, the chef and restaurateur, opened this fine Italian establishment as his fourth Cleveland eatery. 

It is good. I had an amazing time. The hostess allowed me to walk right in to meet with my group. I don't enjoy having to be escorted at restaurants. They all had cocktails already, with my arrival we decided to try a couple wines. The Sancerre pinot that I've been wanting for a long time was not available, neither was the chianti our choice for second bottle. We were offered a smooth-tasting Hofstatter Pinot Nero and some other chianti, both were good. Happy in the taste of wines, not happy that what I wanted was not available. I've heard that they have trouble keeping wines in stock. Personally I think they ought to have daily wine menus that the sommelier updates throughout the night so I don't have to be disappointed when my wine is not available. 

The Chef was working the pass and stopped by to say hello to our table. Nice treat especially since we were seated in tables right outside the kitchen, the perfect spot in a restaurant! 

We ended up doing a tasting prix-fixe of chef's choice items. Most were non-menu or variations of. Started with an amuse-bouche, Saffron risotto ball. Classic idea, delicious risotto, however the salty breading overpowered the taste for me. Appetizer of sauteed artichoke hearts and lemon. Salad was Fennel, olive and ricotta. Fresh, simple, and tasty! Pasta was Pappardelle with cauliflower and pecorino. What an excellent pasta dish! Freshly prepared and wonderfully cooked pappardelle (wide, flat noodle) needed little accompaniment but the cauliflower puree and pecorino made the dish soar. I was extremely pleased as you can probably tell. IF you go and want a simple pasta dish that feels like comfort-incarnate get the pappardelle (better go before he changes the menu too). Ocean course was a seared scallop over butternut squash and chickpea. Very tasty but nothing out of this world in my opinion. It was the favorite dish of everyone at the table except myself because I'm not particularly impressed by a scallop. Earth course was beef tongue over baguette with a salsa verde. Mmmm beef tongue. Yum! It was cooked well, a couple of my pieces were a bit over-cooked but I'm the type of person who likes his meat close to rare. Sliced into medallions. I wish I could give the dish more character in my review but it was just really good. Dessert was lemon polenta cake, cannoli, ricotta cheesecake, and chocolate hazlenut mousse. I love the polenta! Yum yum yum! 

In addition to the tasting menu I ordered two extra entrees, the Skate Wing milanese and Sweetbreads Frito Misto. I've been dying to try his Skate wing and let me tell you it was fantastic. Cooked perfectly. Delicious. Can't even put words to it. Sweetbreads were also delicious. Frito misto is a variety of vegetables and meats that are battered and deep fried. It turned out to be too salty for me, but definitely worth it for the sweetbreads. 

Sorry for the length. I try to describe my experience to the T. Its a good restaurant and definitely an experience to go there. The wine list is vast, just hope your choice is in stock. The menu is very good. It takes the traditional Italian dishes, twists them for the modern, and sends them to our taste buds in a flash of flavor. There is also something for everyone on the menu. I am an explorer and work to try the most outlandish and different items in the world. However, the traditional and simple items are just as impressive. 

All in all my experience was very good. I was not uber-impressed with the food. But it was good and I will return a couple more times as there are more dishes that I need to try. Stay tuned for an update in the next month."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Zack Bruell, I expected Chinato to follow suit as some of my other favorites (Parallax and Alley Cat), but this one definitely came up shy. My parents and I went here with a college friend of mine and her parents looking for a nice meal and a more sophisticated atmosphere.  Some things were a hit and some things were a miss... 

First, for an Italian restaurant, wine list was very limited in my opinion, I found one I liked but wasn't blown away.  Second, my surroundings.  Now as I said this is on more of the upper scale of a restaurant and next to us sat a 25 person table celebrating what looked to be a 16 year old birthday of some sort with at least 15 people under the age of 21 who were extremely loud and then decided to scream happy birthday throughout the restaurant.  There is a party room downstairs at this location (WHICH IS SUPER NICE, FYI), why are you not there instead of annoying everyone else around you? *curious emoji* 

Third, now I'll get to the food.  Our appetizer was actually delicious, we ended up ordering a pizza to split amongst us since we were a bigger party and we got pork, tomatoes, egg, and truffle oil and it was really delicious, perfectly thin stone oven pizza and the combination of the topping was absolutely delicious!  The meal is where it kind of fell flat, I ordered to gnocchi (one of my favorite meals of all time) and I think I almost used the entire dish of salt they put on the table because there was absolutely zero flavor. I didn't know if they missed the mark when boiling them or in the sauce but either or, would not order again and ended up not even eating my leftovers.  My mom's dish also mentioned it lacked flavor as well and the portions are on the smaller side, but that is to be expected.  

Overall I just really wasn't blown away, I wasn't interested in any of the salad's they really had to offer nor the desserts and my food was under par to what I was expecting. Hate to say it, but too much better Italian elsewhere."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to eat at Chinato last week and I was disappointed.  Our group of 4 was  seated for 10 mins before someone came over to take our drink order (although we were served delicious bread several times in that period).  I ordered the baked garganelli which is a pasta dish that was described as something similar to lasagna.  My fellow diners had linguine with scallops, another had gnocchi, and one had braised beef.  My dish was luke warm.  I should have sent it back but didn't in the interest of not holding up the dinner party.  Not sure how a baked dish could only be luke warm; suspect that perhaps it was reheated? The other diners said there entrees were 'not bad' and 'pretty good' which I believe was code for 'nothing special'.  I suspect they were being kind since I was picking up the tab.  Overall I was very disappointed since everyone speaks well of Zach's restaurants."}
{"text":"Cold entrees, moldy desserts, and terrible management.  Epic fail!

We went to Chinato to celebrate our 17th anniversary.  We had reservations and were seated in the bar.  Basically we had peoples' butts in our faces all night since they were standing right up against the table.  

First we ordered the Tuna Crudo and Fried Artichokes.  The Tuna was shaved so thin you could see through it - but you couldn't taste it.  You could only taste the crispy speck and the tomato coulis.  The artichokes were difficult to eat.  They were fibrous and spiny.  They did taste good though.

Next we shared a \"Shaved\" mushroom salad.  More like a chopped button mushroom salad.  There was nothing shaved about it.  It tasted good, but you would think they would use something other than button mushrooms.

I ordered the Tripe for my entree and my husband had the Duck Confit Ravioli.  My tripe was just OK.  It was cooked well, but had no tripe flavor whatsoever.  It was so watered down that you wouldn't even know you were eating tripe if you had your eyes closed.  Zach... if you would like to taste how tripe is supposed to be prepared, send me an email and I will have you over for a tasting.  You won't regret it. 

My husband's ravioli was served cold.  I mean cold.  Not slightly warm or room temperature.  Just cold.  It was terrible. So bad in fact that he sent it back and asked for something different.  On the advise of the waiter he had the braised beef. It was very tender and juicy.  It was served on a boatload of cheesy polenta - enough for a meal in and of itself.  It was good.  The assistant manager did come and apologize.  Our waiter said the chef was new.

Finally we ordered the Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse for dessert.  It came out with three red MOLDY raspberries.  MOLDY food served at a respected restaurant.  The same manager came and apologized and took it away.

Now for the kick in the face.  They bring out the check.  The MOLDY dessert was removed off our bill with a reason of \"DISLIKE\" printed on the bill.  I guess that's accurate enough since I dislike eating moldy food.  What's worse, they charged us for the braised beef.  My husband called over the general manager and had to ask to have it comped!  He had to ask to have the replacement food for his cold dinner comped!  And then you would think they would do something else after having to send TWO dishes back.  But they didn't.  I have been to much \"lower class\" restaurants that was run by much \"higher class\" of people.

Zach - you should be embarrassed.  To serve a cold plate and then expect it to be paid for is amateur at best.  To serve MOLDY food is disgusting and irresponsible.  To not even comp us a drink or a replacement dessert is just classless.  They should have comped our whole meal and maybe I wouldn't be writing this scathing review.  By the way... I was serious about showing you what tripe should taste like."}
{"text":"Stopped at Chinato for dinner with friends. I was not particularly hunger, so I avoided an appetizer. My entree was the braised beef with polenta. I don't order beef as my protein all that often.this meat was so soft, moist and tender. In addition to that the texture was a good contrast to the polenta. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Discovered this place via Yelp and had a tough time deciding between Chinato and some of the other renowned restaurants on the block. Being from out of town, we picked the place with the most \"unique\" menu - and quite glad we did.

The waiter recommended the special of the day appetizer - which was long necked clams in a delicious sauce with some veggies and butter. It came out almost like a soup - in a good way - and was generous both in portion size and flavor. We ate up every bite, and (borrowing an idea from one of the Yelp reviews) asked for an extra serving of their delicious bread to sop up some of the remnant juices.

For entrees, I ordered the Tagliatelle on the advice of my waiter, and don't regret it one bit! The eclectic mix of meats with a hearty sauce and generous portion came out looking almost like a stew. The pasta was delicious, and the flavor balance was wonderful. My companion ordered the braised beef and seemed to enjoy every bite; I loved the polenta that it came on.

Service was prompt, our table was ready exactly when our reservation said it would be, and I really enjoyed that everyone seemed to pitch in to make our experience better - other waiters, bus staff, and possibly a manager stopped by and pitched in. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a special occasion or romantic night out. We were even lucky enough to catch a huge fireworks show on the horizon as our meal finished.  :)"}
{"text":"This is the date night location of choice when my friend Marie comes downtown. We like to sit at the bar, order a drink and catch up. The service is always great and the bartenders are friendly and informative. 

We usually grab an app and split then go straight for the carbs. The pasta dishes are great. We mix it up every time and are never disappointed. 

Date recommendation: grab a table, a drink, the cheese board and then your pasta or entree of choice. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day. They had the offer to do the 3 course dinner per couple. We really enjoyed this place, the restaurant was really cute inside and food was really good. The portions were really small, but we had a lot of leftovers."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for three nights - ate here twice.. Very pleased with service and qiality of of our meals. John teh Bratender was stellar - helped us with some tips on site seeing - (thanks again john) . If your travels take you downdoen Clevland - - Check it out"}
{"text":"Very modern, trendy decor. We had several dishes and each was very good. Several salads that were very flavorful and gnocchi was was quite nice. Several vegetarian options. Not a place for kids - too modern and trendy. The waiter was very, very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Omg best service and food in Cleveland! This place reminds me of RPM in Chicago, which is my weekly favorite! Thank you Molly for being so attentive and precise to our orders! Anytime I got lost on the drink menu or food menu, molly guided me to the bullseye! Can't wait to bring my friends and family from Chicago here! Way to go Chinato! Will be back when I'm in the land again! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with 5 co-workers to celebrate a work anniversary.  Service and ambiance were similar to Zack Bruell's other restaurants.  We arrived at our reserved time and were promptly seated, water glasses filled, bread distributed, olive oil and coarse salt displayed on the table.   Our server was attentive and patient.  I ordered the tonnerelli with black pepper, pecorino and lemon.   The pasta dish arrived in a large shallow bowl.  The tonnerelli pasta was the equivalent of a thick spaghetti, simply tossed in olive oil and black pepper, topped with pecorino cheese and lemon zest.  The combination of the olive oil and pecorino made for a nice, rich sauce which coated the pasta very nicely.  The lemon and black pepper added the finishing touch.   This was a very good dish.  I would rank Chinato and L'Albatros as my favorite Zack Bruell restaurants.  I still have to try Parallax.   I'll definitely return....soon!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing.

I took a customer here before the Cleveland Indians game, and we were both completely impressed with the waiter's knowledge of the menu and his explanations of entrees. Not to mention the excellent food.

It started with the excellent bread with oil, then the mussels as an appetizer. (After eating the mussels the waiter clearing the table recommended more bread to soak up the juice... Amazing) I had the pork and my colleague had the veal. Both highly recommended by the waiter who was spot on.

Whenever I'm back to Cleveland, I'm taking my wife to Chinato."}
{"text":"Excellent! I was at a private party in the lower level area so I can't comment on the ambiance in the rest of the restaurant but downstairs was pretty cool.

I knew this was a great restaurant when I ordered my first drink and was extremely surprised to find that they had Golden Draak on tap. If you don't know, Golden Draak (spelled differently with umlauts on the bottle) is a premium Belgian beer. I've never heard of it being on tap and it was oh so good.

The food was just simply excellent. My girlfriend didn't like the arugula salad but I think it's just because she doesn't like arugula. Probably not a good choice of a salad to get then. I thought it was very good and then we went on to the entree, which blew our mind. Because we were there for an event, we had a fixed menu. Everyone that selected the braised beef couldn't stop with the comments of \"this is amazing!\", \"the beef is ridiculously good!\", \"can you believe how good this is?\". Serious, it was that good. Really, really enjoyed it.

We then went on to a desert, which I had the tiramisu (good but not amazing) and my girlfriend's cheesecake (good).

Overall it was very very good and I would not only go again but recommend it to anyone looking for a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner!!!  Went here with clients and had an amazing meal.  Had a few appetizers recommended by the server, most of which were really yummy. The Involtini of Eggplant stuffed with ricotta and shrimp was delicious! Had some little fried balls which were awesome, but cannot remember the name and had the mussels, which were not good at all.  Had the swordfish as an entree which was wonderful and had the lemon polenta cake and tiramisu which were both fantastic!  The bar service could use a little work...had to beg them to wait on us before and after dinner, but all others were very professional.  Very nice place with great food!"}
{"text":"Not terrible but my expectations were far better for both service & food. There's really nothing memorable about this place to me and I can't specifically point out anything good or bad. We sat for a good 10 minutes waiting for someone to even fill our water glasses and the place wasn't that busy. For a Bruell restaurant located in a prime spot such as E4th, they need to step up their game about 10 notches. Food was so-so."}
{"text":"I think the best part about Chinato is the service. Definitely hands down one of the best greeting crews in downtown Cleveland. I'd definitely like to come here more often to spend my night with this lively crew!

The pizza is also pretty good here too."}
{"text":"A friend and I dined at another restaurant for Cleveland restaurant week.  It was 77 degrees on February 25th and after dinner we wanted to sit on a nice patio for a glass of wine.  We stopped by Chinato and asked if we could be seated for drinks only and we were escorted a patio table by a very pleasant host.  We told our waiter Dave of our desire to only have wine and he left us a menu just in case.  

My friend and I ordered the same wine and she requested a taste; He brought us both a taste - a nice touch I thought.  Our service was great and we were treated as if we were ordering a full dinner.  No attitude that we were only having wine.

The service at Chinato is clearly top notch;  Our waiter at our \"red\" restaurant was attentive but the hostesses seemed to be bothered my our appearance at the hostess stand.  We commented we should have eaten at Chinato.

The outstanding service impressed us and we will be dining at Chinato very soon!"}
{"text":"A great culinary adventure into non-traditional Italian cuisine.  Chinato is a vision of chef Zack Bruell's approach to flavor and what Italian cuisine could be, perhaps should be. 

Made reservations earlier in the week and they called to confirm.  Parking was convenient on East 4th with their $15 valet.

Their host and hostess seemed detached, almost as if it was a bother for them to seat you. Mind you, it's freezing cold outside and we're in heavy coats.  They didn't even offer coat check and we had to ask about that service.  Ultimately they did hang our coats, and then they came back and threw the claim card on the table.

Our table server was fantastic.  She had an excellent knowledge of the menu and wine list and we felt she made some great suggestions.

The food was really good. Started with their gnocchi that just melted in the mouth, next was egg battered chicken which was nothing short of amazing. 

Desserts were disappointing. They depart from traditional cannolis  to offer ones with a boring, bland cream and a citrus glaze.  Bleh. Not a treat I could ever recommend.

Overall I was pleased and will definitely return. 

The bathrooms are down stairs next to a party room.  Wouldn't want to host a party there as the whole time you'll have restaurant patrons walking through to use the bathroom."}
{"text":"What I Ate
- fried artichokes 
- ravioli with pork, veal, zucchini and shiitake mushrooms with melted butter and parmesan

Would I Go Again?
I must admit that I did not have high expectations for any of the restaurants in downtown Cleveland.  I must admit that Chinato completed changed my mind.  To begin, the location is stellar.  It is in the middle of downtown, within a five-minute walk of the professional basketball and football stadiums.  It was also right next to my hotel.  :)

The food was more than outstanding.  The fried artichokes were very good and unique, and the ravioli was the BEST ravioli ever to grace the inside of my mouth.  I don't even like ravioli, but that dish is changing my mind.  The melted butter and parmesan simply complemented the ravioli's fixings, rather than dominate the pasta.  Great flavor, great taste, and great texture.  

If I ever need to fly back to Cleveland for work, Chinato will be on the top of my list!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice meal with some co-workers while I was in Cleveland for work.

Had the crudo, which was the highlight of the meal.

The Lamb stew was a solid dish, but would have liked a shank instead of the chops. Didn't seem like it was braised long enough, but decent flavors.

Finished the meal with a Tiramsu and a cappuccino, both were good, but not mind blowing. 

This place won't disappoint, but it won't inspire or blow your hair back. It was a just a small step away from being a really good meal. May have been an off night for the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've passed this place so many times, but my wife and I finally decided to stop in for a late dinner on Wednesday.  I am beyond happy the food and experience.  

Service:  (5.0)  They hit it out of the park for me.  The hostess was very nice and quickly informed us about the restaurant week menu, the later-night happy hour menu, and the regular menu (we had plenty of options).  We at ate the bar and the service was great and friendly.  Our bartender was knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks.  We had to quiz her on a few menu items to narrow down our choices and she knew everything by memory.  She also didn't try to upsell us at all, which was nice.  She was also great to talk with and a fun person in general.

Ambiance: (4.0)  It's an understated joint with dim lighting.  Nothing special, but certainly not off putting.  I could see it working for a romantic dinner or a casual meal with friends or family.

Menu: (2.0)  I'm giving it a low rating because the main menu is just too big.  the food on the menu is great, but the size is overwhelming.  The happy hour menu at the bar is short, but it focuses on a few good items such as a crudo sampler, a delicious sausage pizza, a burger, mussels, and a couple other items.  It's really just the standard fare most modern Cleveland restaurants serve, but $5 an item is a solid deal.  The regular menu, as noted, is way too big. Even so, everything on the menu sounded great and we ultimately selected a mix of menu and happy hour items: the crudo sampler, sausage pizza, tongue and eggplant caponata, and garganelli with sweetbreads and gizzards.  

Food:  (3.5 overall) Delicious!!  

The crudo sampler (2.0) was the weakest of the bunch.  It consisted of: scallops with tobiko, scallions and lemon zest; yellowtail with pesto and tomatoes; tuna with lardo; and salmon with orange, fennel, red onion and fennel pollen.  the scallop and the tuna with lardo were both perfect.  The yellowtail and salmon both seemed too fishy for something that should have a very clean flavor, IMO.  Even so, the combinations of flavors in each crudo item worked well. 

The tounge dish (4.0)  incorporates a sweet and sour eggplant caponata.  Don't read \"sweet and sour\" as some sort of Asian influence.  The caponata is actually somewhat traditional and rustic, but the slices of tongue elevate the dish a bit.  The tongue was perfectly cooked and it had a great rendered fat mouthfeel that went well with the eggplant.  The dish lacks a bit of color, but the flavor and textures more than makes up for it.  

The garganelli pasta (5.0) contains sweetbreads, giblets, radicchio, butter, parmesan and breadcrumbs (real breadcrumbs, not some canned junk).  First, the pasta was excellent.  This wasn't some dried pasta pulled from the store shelf.  This is fresh pasta made with care and skill.  Chinato does make their pasta in house, but they don't have an extruder to make things like garganelli and fusilli.  Now, I love Ohio City Pasta, but they didn't get this from Ohio City Pasta.  Whoever made their extruded pasta put an artisan touch in the recipe.  The rest of the dish was equally impressive.  The giblets had just the right amount of give in the bite and the sweebreads were cooked to perfection.  I was worried that the bitter radicchio and the butter parmesan might overpower the sweetbreatds, but that wasn't the case at all.  Everything was in perfect balance. I was happily surprised by the salt level in this dish.  Rustic Italian food tends to use a bit more salt than one might expect.  This dish kept with that salted tradition, which I liked.  A heavy hand of salt in some food can be a terrible experience, but not with this dish.

The Sausage Pizza was also great (3.5).  The crust was thin and a little crispy, with a great char.  I would compare it to a Neapolitan-style pizza, but with a bit more chew to the crust.  However, this isn't some artisan pizza from a wood-fire oven.  The sauce was simple and let the tomato flavor shine, the mozzarella was of a good quality, the were conservative with the cheese, and the sausage seemed fresh and crumbled to the perfect size.  The crust actually had a good bread flavor too--many pizza makers don't put much thought into the flavor of their dough.  It is a light crust and it's pizza in a more proper/traditional form; don't expect to get delivery-style pizza here.  

Overall, I say it was a 3.5 to a 4-star experience (I'm leaning towards 4).  Had the crudo been better, it would be a 4.5 to 5-star dinner.  This place has a lot of Zack Bruell hype, but I think it actually lives up to that hype.   I'll certainly go back to see if we get a repeat experience."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time a few weeks ago.  i was shocked to get a 7:30 reservation for 2 on a Friday night.  Great ambiance, amazing food, and the service was above par.  The server was very helpful with my wine selection.   Bottle of wine, salad, appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 desert and 1 after dinner drink will put you at 180 with tip.   It's worth it!"}
{"text":"This place was wayyyyy too overpriced and didn't taste good at ALL. No flavor to food and was very bland. I would've rather had barrio for less than half the price and would've left satisfied"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a Saturday evening. When we arrived, we were quickly ushered into the bar which  is close to the front door. We were told there were several large partirs coming in. At the end of the meal, I went to the restroom and there were MANY empty tables and no large parties!  We were frozen and will NEVER go back"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for business and this place was recommended. The col buco was great. Service was on target, and pricing was as expected. I liked it so much I went for lunch the next day and had the tagliatelle...also quite good."}
{"text":"The waiter was fabulous, made great suggestions that were delicious! The drinks were really good! The atmosphere was light and friendly! We had the linguine and clam and the braised beef both were wonderful! The bread for the table yum!!"}
{"text":"Chinato is an Italian-fusion restaurant, not Chinese. The servers seemed to pronounce it \"Kee-nah-toe\", and not with a \"Ch\", but whatever, don't let the first 5 letters fool you. This trendy restaurant sits in East 4th street, lined up alongside Lola and The Greenhouse Tavern, completing the Cleveland culinary dream team.

We called in for reservations at 5, left the car at the valet (all for 8 bucks with validation -- the public lots were charging $35 that night), and afterwards, crossed the street towards the Q arena for a Cavs game at 730 to watch our basketball dream team. It was a perfect night out just taking in the best of what Cleveland can offer; world-class fine dining and major league sports!

The group ordered cocktails, escargot (which seems to use the exact same recipe across all Zack Bruell restaurants), lobster crudo, skate wing, chicken legs saltimbocca, scallops with linguine. All were fresh, served hot, tasted pure and delicious. We spotted the owner Zack himself helping with the dish preparations. Considering it was game night, East 4th and all the restaurants were extremely packed and busy. In Chinato, service was quick, the staff were on their game, and hardly missed a beat.

The Cavs won against the Pacers that night, and so did my digestive system.

I love this town!"}
{"text":"I went to Chinato for dinner after an end-of-day meeting.  The dinner  was with me
myself and I.  I requested a table nearby the kitchen action and somewhat secluded from the rest of the dinner crowd. The host was very gracious and found me the perfect spot, who stopped by couple times during dinner, to ensure I was happy with the table and my experience.  I intentionally avoided the bar as it seemed crowded and somewhat busy.

I was served my drinks very promptly by a very informative server. The dining area was sparsely filled with tables of twos or fours. The decor is modern with sharp lines white linen and interesting lighting.

They have a pretty decent wine list served by the glasses or by bottles.  Part of the kitchen opens to the dining area however does not create too much sound or commotion to disturb the diners. The food menu offers a variety of entrees, salads, appetizers and dessert.  I tried the beef brisket on creamy polenta. I found the polenta to be a bit too rich yet tasteful and creamy. The beef brisket was prepared well with the right balance of  taste and tenderness. I paired this entree with a glass of Chardonnay, upon the suggestion of the server.  This was a great choice.  I finished my meal with polenta cakes served with lemon sorbet for my desert. The polenta
cake had the consistency of soft grits yet sweet and came in the shape of the cake flash fried to maintain shape.  Trust me, this desert is one to try.  The textures and taste pair well with a good combination of sweet and tart.

Overall I was treated very well served very promptly and felt comfortable dining even though I was alone. The wine and the food choices were very good suggestions as well as tastefully presented.  I will certainly return to Chinato and maybe next time with dinner company."}
{"text":"Took the husband here last night for a birthday dinner, never again! Limited drink list, soggy bread, empty water glasses,  cold entrées, unattentive server, workers walking around doing nothing, overpriced food, small entrée portions, unfriendly workers. That about sums it up- save your money and choose a real fine dining establishment in and around Cleveland."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar after the cavs parade for HH and early dinner. Most of the food was great like last time but the octopus entree came out with only a few thin slices of a tentacle. John, one of the bartenders, checked on how things were and I mentioned good but disappointed with the amount of octopus, especially since the other bartender told me it was supposed to be a good portion when I asked about ordering the entree vs the appetizer version. He said that didn't sound right and that he would check with the kitchen. After a few minutes, they brought out what was about 6x what I had gotten initially and in line with what I had expected from an entree. Granted it didn't taste as good as the first portion I had gotten, but I chalk that up to being a rough day with everything that was going on. Despite everything, the servers really go out of their way to please!  They remained friendly and professional even after a long and hectic day of dealing with drunks."}
{"text":"Incredible, incredible. 

The entrance is hard to find, but that just makes it more exclusive as it only draws in the savy diners.

There were so many mouth watering entrees and pasta dishes that we had a hard time deciding. That's the great thing about Chinato...the menu comes in two sizes...small/large. The prices of two small dishes equal to that of a large; unlike other places where the delta is so minimal, you may as well get the large; but this doesn't leave you much room for food tasting.  Having two sizes available allows you to try a couple tasting dishes.

The \"Col Buco with slow roasted pork shoulder, tomato and white wine\" was perfectly seasoned with the long spiral pasta cooked al dente. The pork pulled apart easily and melted in your mouth.

Other dishes we tried were the Mussels with saffron and fennel, gnocchi, and scallops. All were equally delicious."}
{"text":"Bar service was meh but the food was excellent - I had a pasta Col Buco that was as good as it gets! The tomato bread soup was good. Tagliatella was great! The pistaccio cheesecake was meh."}
{"text":"I went to Cleveland to see some friends and see the city. We had gone to another restaurant the night before and the waiter [food savvy] sent us to Chinato. The ambiance was very nice; we were seated immediately. My friend got one of their salads and I got scallops in lobster broth with thin pasta which was very good. It was soupier than I expected but this is what is [lobster broth]. It was a very nice place and would return and recommend when visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":".... Not good ....

They're saying my review is too short so I'll expound. We got the cocktail of the day. Pear vodka with prosecco. 3/10

The margarita pizza was a sloppy mess as you could see from the picture. It felt like they rain it through the dishwasher before the brought it out to us. Gnocchi was average, pretty bland."}
{"text":"The linguini with scallops was like ramen noodles and 4 tiny scallops.
The meal was horrible and the bottles of wine were marked up 500%. I asked for extra bread and received ins half piece.
The meal sucked I will never return!"}
{"text":"Another solid option on 4th street.  Dined here for the first time tonight and will definitely be back.  The veal was unbelievable, the seafood medley was outstanding and the drinks were very good.  Knowledgeable waitstaff make it the dining experience it should be."}
{"text":"The staff are great. Antipasti fabulous. But I ordered the Zuppa Peschi and it came out extremely greasy. Then they took it back. It came out again as a salty, garlicky pasty mess. My colleague ordered the linguini which was over salty. They had a special beef soup that was overly thick as well. Not a very good traditional Italian food experience and I lived in Europe for three years."}
{"text":"Went there for a bday party recently. Decor felt cold. Servers could have been more attentive. I ordered a specialty cocktail..it tasted like watered down juice. Now onto why I gave 4 stars; THE FOOD. The group of 15 I was with all loved their food! I personally ordered the grilled vegetable salad($9) to start. It tasted great, but it was 1 of those things you can only eat so much of. Entree I ordered scallops. Huge scallops cooked to perfection. The largest asparagus spears I've ever seen. The broth tasted like lobster bisque & it was perfect. Their braised beef dish supposedly is pretty amazing as well."}
{"text":"Great food, great dessert, great atmosphere! Never disappoints. Very fun in the summer as you can sit outside along east 4th."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.

Business casual attire. Main dishes 20 buck range. 

The mushroom salad was very good. Sliced mushrooms with a hint of lemon with arugula, some jalepenos, and a light dressing. Would highly recommend it. Main course was prochetta. Just ok. Portion size is a bit on the small side. Very tastey. Not at too salty as I sometimes expect restaurants to do. 

Overall service was great and kept us filled with a nice fluffy Italian bread and olive oil. Would come again!"}
{"text":"It really pains me to write this update of Chinato, especially since my first meal there was such an awesome experience. 

So, JM and I decided to grab a quick bite to eat on E4th on a Saturday night. Being the last minute folks we are, we just walked into Chinato and figured we'd grab a seat at the bar. (Honestly, we prefer to sit at the bar in most places anyways.) 

The service seemed nice and attentive and the bartender was asking us questions about the menu to see if we needed help. 

...and that's when it went downhill for me. 

Don't get me wrong, the food was absolutely divine. Spot on. Delicious. Kudos to Chef Bruell. But when your bartender tries to upsell you so much that it makes you uncomfortable? That's no good. 

I know I'm at a nice restaurant, but I don't feel the need to spend $50 on a bottle of wine. I can't taste the difference anyways and I know that ish costs $20 at Giant Eagle. I used to bartend, OK? When you ask me if you can suggest a bottle of wine and I say, \"yes--keep in the 20's\", that apparently translates to: bring back a bottle knowing it's $40, talk about it forever and THEN say it's around $35... give or take a few bucks. 

And to add even more icing to the cake, how about you upsell us on a $15 appetizer while you're at it? Because we all know it's the most expensive one on the menu. Then tell me all the less expensive options I want aren't as good as the one you're trying to sell me on. 

I thought I was at a restaurant, not a car dealership. 

Jason and I were way too polite to say something, but the male bartender (the one with tattoos) really lays in on thick to make an extra buck in tips. Honestly, it ruins the entire dining experience. There was a female bartender (long blonde hair) who was just a doll. Unfortunately, we weren't lucky enough to get her as our server. 

I'm sure I'll end up back at Chinato, the food is fantastic. But I'll never sit at the bar again. And seriously? They should really quit hiring folks like that."}
{"text":"I went to this place for happy hour. The drinks was fantastic, every single staff I came across were friendly and was exceptionally professional."}
{"text":"Great food and unbelievably cheap! I had the halibut and it was amazing. Our waitress was very patient and nice too. We were a large group with lots of requests.. Highly, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went to Chinato for a casual workday lunch.  Walked-in and got a table a little bit before noon, which was a plus.   I liked the design of the restaurant--a simple and clean layout that feels intimate without being cramped.

The Tomato and Bread Soup was very good, with just the right amount of bread in it to give it the right body and texture.  For a lunch entree I had the Col Buco with Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder, Tomato, and White Wine.  I was a little less enthused with this dish.  The pork shoulder, while of good quality, did not seem to me to make the dish any greater than the sum of its parts.  Still, not to be too harsh, the dish was a grade higher than the Pesto Omar I had at La Strada across the street.

I noticed only two somewhat-minor faults.  First, the bread--which is brought around continuously from a server carrying a basket of bread--was below expectations.  Second, when I asked the server what was the \"signature dish\" of the restaurant, he just fumbled and responded with what he personally liked from the menu.

Overall, however, Chinato was an enjoyable experience and a welcome addition to the growing East Fourth selection of restaurants."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check out Chinato for a romantic evening and a chance to try out another restaurant on East 4th Street.  We are both social workers so we don't get to do it up like this all the time, so we did the damn thing and got dressed to the nines.  Needless to say, when we plan to fork over $100+ for a meal we hope to leave satisfied.  

Service:  We both have an affinity for good, friendly service so we were really pleased when our server was friendly and down-to-earth.  She was very knowledgeable of the menu and made great recommendations.  Chinato's menu is complex, large and confusing.  The dishes are mostly in Italian and lack any description of the preparation or ingredients... so you really don't know what you are ordering unless you ask.  It's a good thing our server was so chill because we had a lot of questions.  At one point I asked for a glass of Merlot and she responded with, \"Do you like Malbec? Because we have a really great Malbec and it's cheaper than the Merlot...\" She really made us feel comfortable and relaxed.

Food:  For my starter I wanted a salad  and I ordered the Arugula with julienne of pumpkin, roasted turnips, pumpkin seeds, goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette, at our servers suggestion.  It was really amazing.  A great start to the meal.  The server also recommended that we order a pasta and a entree so I assumed that they'd be small portions.  I ordered the Risotto with speck and yellow pepper as my second course.  This was actually pretty bland and uninteresting.  I didn't even finish it.  Which is probably a good thing because our entrees were not small... they were normal sized and by the time I got mine I was already kind of full.  Nonetheless, I took the servers recommendation and got the \"Deconstructed\" Ribollita.  I had no idea what it was but she talked about vegetables, marinara and pulled pork in a way that I just couldn't say no.  It really was great.  It had some hidden lemon zest and cheese hidden among ribbons of  zucchini and summer squash on top of potatoes, pulled pork and a really great marinara.  I wish I could have eaten more of it but at that point I could only take a few bites.  I really didn't want anything else but we decided to split a desert after we saw some delivered to a nearby table.  My boyfriend has a nut allergy so we ordered the only allergy-friendly thing on the menu, Lemon Polenta Cake.  When it arrived it looked great but upon first bite I was disappointed.  I expected a moist, warm lemon-y cake... but it was a room temperature, \"stale\" textured and somewhat crunchy cake that we didn't care to finish.  The lemon ice cream on the top was pretty tasty though.

The only other thing that can be said is that the ambiance of the restaurant is more commercial than I'd expected.  I also noticed that while we were there it was LOUD and the table behind us was getting so rowdy that they broke a wine glass.  Not really what I expected on a romantic dinner-date."}
{"text":"Totally ovarated, nice ambiance. But food is not good. Spaghetti carbonara were soaking in sauce, very salty. That was my second time, won't go back. Out of 7 of us, only one was ok with quality of the food. Zach Bruell has to rethink his cuisine. 
Very disappointed"}
{"text":"It may sound unpleasant to most, however, the beef tongue is to die for. An appetizer of chicken livers is a great way to start your meal. We have been here three times and each time we have had terrific meals. The wait staff was fantastic. We never ran out of bread or drink the entire time we were there. Love Chinato!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Chinato. I have never had something that wasn't amazing when I've visited. In addition to a great dining experience, they have a ridiculous Happy Hr. $5 small plates - the prices can't be beat for the food quality. 

I can't go to Chinato without getting the Tuscon Onion Soup. It's heavenly! The other antipasti that I just can't avoid is the Involtini of Eggplant ... YUM! 

The great thing about this menu is that you can get 1/2 sizes on the pasta - which allows you sample a few (or leave less full - I sample a few...) The Gnocchi is unreal. There's nothing better than some perfectly made pasta sitting in basil, butter, parmesan, garlic and tomato. On the Entree side - the Deconstructed Ribollita is truly wonderful. 

My one take-away of Chinato is to try something unique. Try something outside of your normal culinary box. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went here for restaurant week and our experience was okay overall, nothing spectacular but not terrible. Our waiter was really great though and the restaurant week prices were perfect for sampling Chinato, $33 each of us for three courses. The goods...

*Bread with olive oil - The bread was nothing special but the olive oil had great flavor.
*Shaved Pork Salad with Butternut Squash, Arugula, Parmesan Smoked Potato Dressing - Could have used some black pepper, but it was tasty. 
*Roasted Cauliflower Soup - Large bowl of creamy soup that was tasty. 
*Roasted Half Chicken with Eggplant Fries - I really enjoyed this dish and there was enough of it that I had to get a to-go box. I think the sauce was a pesto one?
*Market Fish with Grilled Polenta, Celery and Endive Salad - The fish was very bland with no flavor at all. 
*Beet and Goat Cheese Ravioli with Pecorino Cheese and Fresh Herbs - Smaller portion than the other dishes but the buttery/cheesy sauce was pretty good. 
*Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse Cake - Plain until you get to the center with hazelnut crisps. I wish there would have been more of those crisps! 
*Tiramisu - Nothing special. 
*Pistachio Cheesecake - We all agreed that this was the best dessert of the night. 

Not sure if I would come back, but glad I checked it out! The regular menu is a little pricey but might be a nice place for a date because of the romantic atmosphere."}
{"text":"As a fan of Zack Bruell's places, I have to say Chinato is my least favorite of them... 

Service was A++++
Food was a C (I have both switched up my eats, and tried the same thing multiple times)
Wine selection A++++ 
Atmosphere B+

I am not a pretentious person by any means and for some reason, the crowd in here seems to echo that most of the time.  On very few occasions did I feel like the crowd was more laid back.  I mean, come on, this is Cleveland, not Manhattan."}
{"text":"Always a fantastic experience! The service is on point, the wine list is great and the food is even better. I love the atmosphere and the paintings."}
{"text":"The service compensated for too much salt! Chelsea was best server ever. Suggest tell them no extra salt. Lovely restaurant had reservations during NBA finals and even though slammed treated us as only guest! We would come back"}
{"text":"For a time, this was our favorite restaurant in downtown Cleveland. I mean for like four years. Alas, time marches on, but unfortunately Chinato has not. The menu offerings haven't changed at all in years, and the food is just not up to snuff as it once was. Speaking of stale menus the paper, wrinkled, torn, stained menus we received showed their age and then some. Not what you expect at these prices.  

Food was ok. Tomato bread soup is fundamentally a bowl of tasty pasta sauce as was missing the bread crouton on top. It needs lots of bread, and fortunately our excellent waitress kept it coming.  The service here is great. The salads are fine at these price points ($10-$13). Fine, but just 3 star fine. My partner has given up on the gnocchi as it does not have any wow factor like it did when it was new so many years ago, and actually tasted like store bought rather than the way it used to be, melt in your mouth incredible. Three ravioli at silver dollar size (half plate) were fine. Really? Three ravioli for $13? Do the math on that. Again, the dish was 3 star average. My entree of the braised beef in polenta was very good. Beef was perfect. 

So service is top notch, cocktails are very, very good, and food is just ok. Needs to be better at these prices and for the location to keep people coming and not heading to other establishments on E 4th. Used to be worth it. 

I fear Zach Bruell may be spreading his restaurant management abilities too thin. It may be time to dial back on a few establishments and get back to basics. 

Great atmosphere and wonderful bar area."}
{"text":"I've been to Chinato twice and enjoyed myself both times. I've sat in the downstairs dining room the first time and upstairs most recently. Generally, the ambience is romantic with low lighting, modern, but comfortable seating, elegant silverware and dressed up wait staff. The upstairs dining room is a bit noisy, especially when full. The male bathroom could use more frequent cleaning; there was toilet paper in the floor and water splashed around the sinks.

I like the complimentary bread that comes with the meal, however some of my friends found it dry and tough, which it is. The accompanying EVOO is delicious, so dip away.

Both times I've dined here, I've shared meals with friends. Their pasta dishes are incredible. The pasta is always al dente and seasoned well. The dishes were tasty, beautifully seasoned. I also like they have two portion sizes options for their pasta dishes.

As you can expect, the service is generally very good. The staff is friendly, warm and mindful. On nights, however, that are busy, you may need to call your server over once or twice. Otherwise, if you're looking for a nice dining experience, perhaps for a special night even, and want to support a local celebrity chef, then Chinato is a fine choice."}
{"text":"The restaurant was great.  Especially the mushroom salad it was rustic and very tasty.  I had the scallops and gnocchi entree and loved it.  Goat cheese in ravioli!!  Traveling from pittsburgh to Cleveland for a show.   Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre so disappointed. Lamb was stringy and flavorless, 3 small scallops with boring pasta. Bread was good so paid way too much for way too little."}
{"text":"Just OK. I got the arugula salad and the gnocchi and the other one of us got the brick flattened chicken. The food was pretty good but all the vegetables they claimed to come with were chopped so fine that they were lost in sauce land. So I had just gnocchi and he had just chicken. The food was still good but after the hour and ten minutes it took a I come out I was hoping it would be well worth the wait. It was probably an extra long hour plus because I couldn't hear the person I was sitting with as this place appears to draw in a loud Case Western crowd. Glad I gave this place a try but probably won't be back. There are just too many Italian places within 15-20 minutes that blows this place out of the water."}
{"text":"I visited Chinato tonight with some friends for a birthday celebration. We were seated quickly with a reservation for 10. The service was kind, despite having to serve a bunch of college students who may be clueless to how to behave at a restaurant they were very patient. The overall ambiance felt  very much like L'Albatross. The candles, plates and even the bread tasted the same. The menu also did not look too creative. Which is why I gave it a three stars. It's a good average restaurant with an average selection of entree and wine list. Everything is pretty average. 
Though enjoyed the wine I ordered (a Rosso from Sicily), I was not too impressed with my Chicken Leg entree. 

I believe the quality and technique of dish should also reflect the price. The entree is pretty awesome if it only costs $12, but since it costs $17, I was not impressed due to how simple the dish already is. The chicken Leg was tender but really, it's hard for a restaurant to mess up chicken leg since it's one of the more tender part of a chicken. The bottom had a creamy mashed potatoes which reminded me of this other dish I had at Table 45 (I know! Sister restaurants!) My complaint was that the dish was kind of soggy. I'm not sure if it's because the chicken leg's water drooled out into the mashed potatoes or if it was intentional, but in any case, it made the overall presentation of the dish soggy. Almost like eating a thick soup with a chicken leg on top. Not to mention, I found a hair in my dish. 

No, I did not send the dish back because I found a hair in my dish. It's just not very pleasant to find a human hair in a soggy plate of potatoes. My other friend ordered the sword fish said that she also found a hair in her food. That's not really okay.

Everyone else seem to think their food was good. Nothing special, so I think Chinato deserves a 3 star for food and a 4 star for service."}
{"text":"My birthday was there and i was happy with the service and food, i think that its a special place for sure to have a good dinner."}
{"text":"More like 3.5, but I try to look for the good in things.

3 friends and I had dinner here before watching Bill Burr kill it at the State Theater.

The good: Service, cheese board, and cured meats were unimpeachable. I had a Mccallen to go with the apps and the pour was generous. Had the sea scallops as an entree and they were excellent, as was the broccoli and lobster sauce. However....

The bad: The pisarei was horrific. This starch-based side is supposed to consist of bread dumplings and typically beans. What was on my plate looked like thick soggy tortilla chips, and it tasted like clay-infused cardboard. There was not enough lobster sauce to cover up this culinary atrocity.

My companions enjoyed their entrees en toto so I'm hoping that the cook that day was simply not familiar with pisarei preparations. It happens."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch today while visiting downtown Cleveland.   The chef, Cory, personally came to our table and was most friendly and informative.   Five of us dinned , and each had something different.   I enjoyed my Chicken dish, which was prepared wonderfully.   Would recommed this Italian restaurant  for both lunch or dinner.  Well worth the price...."}
{"text":"Love love love. Had a wonderful dinner with my husband and mother last night it was our first time dining at Chinato and we will def be back. Mike was our server and explained all our questions about the menu, he also have very good recommendations. 

I had the sea scallops (cooked perfectly) with gnocchi and broccolini in a lobster sauce. It was good but a little salty and I didn't care for the way the gnocchi was prepared. 
The reason I'm giving this place 5 stars... my mom ordered the Col buco  (pasta in a light red sauce with basil and ricotta) and pork shoulder. It was soooo amazing! 
And my husband got the tagliatelle which was also very tasty. 
For dessert we got the chocolate hazelnut moose. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere on fourth street. Have been wanting to try it out but could never get in. Did it on open table and was very happy with the service. They sat us 15 minutes early the drinks came fast after the order. The place was very busy because of the browns gladiator and indians game downtown at once. Food was very well prepared and hot. I should have only did the half order on my pasta there was plenty of leftovers. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because my wife's pasta was just good not amazing like my veal sausage pasta. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Since this was my 3rd time dining at this restaurant, I thought it would be the \"charm\".  I guess the saying isn't always correct!  

For starters, it took us over an hour to get our food during lunch.  Secondly, I have never seen someone mess us a calamari/squid salad as bad as these guys.  The calamari was cut into a million pieces, and had a horribly rubber finish.  As someone who eats tons of raw and cooked fish, I have never had such a horrible product.  Even grocery store squid salad has a better taste.  To top things off, the chicken on the salad (that I chose to add) was a flattened fried piece of chicken. Please tell me why anyone would serve this with a salad.  Salad is made for grilled chicken, not chicken for a Marsala dish.  

Although I like many of Zack's restaurants, this one is a mess!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. This is my 3rd Zack Bruell's restaurant (After table 45 and parallax) and I think food wise, this is my least favorite. Nonetheless, Been to Chinato twice now. To read what I think about it the first time, read Matt C,'s review since we went together with his parents.

However, I went again today and WHOA totally different!! One, I was not stuck in the basement where the echos sucked and the noise volume was intense. I actually got to sit in a booth with great service (to be fair, there wasn't a lot of people at the time). 

Linguine with baby clams, calamari and scallions (3.5)-- I gotta rave about the calamari on this dish. Read my review on Table 45 to learn what a big seafood fan I am. Most restaurants you go to make a great seafood pasta but when it comes to the actual seafood, a lot of restaurants don't have really fresh tasting seafood. Chinato's calamari was very fresh tasting and I loved it that way. The pasta sauce was delicious too. However, I gotta complain a bit about the linguine and the clams. One, the clams was not fresh and I didn't taste the true flavors of clams. Second, the linguine wasn't a normal linguine... I don't even know how to explain what kind of pasta it was.. it was just different. ANd there was not a good portion of it at all.

Almond Panna Cotta (3.5)-- the texture of the panna cotta was JUST amazing. I loved the texture but i didn't really taste that much almond flavor. If the dessert menu didn't tell me it was almond, I would've guessed it was jsut vanilla panna cotta."}
{"text":"I am not a picky eater at all. Totally love everything but this place had food so bad I had to take it home and have my bf doctor it up before I could swallow it. I had the duck ravioli (almost a $30 dish) and they brought it out on a skinny plate that had 5 PEICES of ravioli on it. I bit in to one and I swear to God it tasted like ravioli. GROSS!!

I'm only giving it 2 stars because the escargot sauce was good and the ambiance was nice but it's totally overrated."}
{"text":"One word: overrated. The location of the restaurant is great and the service is attentive but out of Zack Bruell's collection of restaurants, I prefer L'Albatros and Parallax hands down. The appetizer was my favorite of the night: scallop crudo - delicate and simple. The rest of the meal was meh. Overpriced. I only tried the pasta here, however, so maybe I could be convinced to go back for an entree."}
{"text":"You can do better.  Leave this place for large groups of conventioneers.  The food wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great.  The service was competent and the meals were properly prepared, but they lacked flavor and the service lacked personality.

If you're in town for a short time, there are a lot better options."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here with my boyfriend. We ordered the gnocchi with red sauce and the salumi plate. Light appetizers and drinks were perfect for us. The food was fantastic and the portions were just right. The bartender John was a really great guy. It was my birthday and he made me a delicious birthday drink. He was friendly and knowledgable. We will definitely be returning here when we come back to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited on the night of the Billy Joel concert.  Be aware they do keep tables back.  Just because the seating app says there is no room, there may be.

I reserved my table the morning of the concert.  We arrived timely and our table was waiting.  The restaurant is on 4th street, heart of Cleveland's trendy scene.  I was disappointed in the décor, but the good and wait staff more than compensated.

Everything is ala carte, but each course is a movement in a symphony.  I had pasta, daughter had been and we were both well pleased.  The wait staff was attentive without being cloying.

For desert we shared a hazelnut tort.  I thought I might have to slap daughter's hand to get the last bite.

A truly superior restaurant experience.  Go.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time with by husband last night and had a near-flawless experience. We live two buildings away and I love Italian so I'd been wanting to try Chinato for some time, but the menu is a little pricey. They were offering a $30 prefixe menu for restaurant week, so I knew this was my chance to try it guilt free!

We dined on a Tuesday night around 630. We made reservations, which at first seemed unnecessary as the restaurant wasn't very crowded but it started to fill up shortly after 7 so I was glad we did. The hostess welcomed us warmly, saying that she was glad we chose to dine with them tonight. It could have been cheesy, but felt very sincere. She gave us the option of dining in the lounge/bar or the larger dining room. We actually chose a booth in the lounge because it was less crowded and had romantic decor - we are newlyweds so this seemed important.

The bartender was our waiter and he was wonderful. Attentive throughout the night, even when the bar filled up and he had other tables. Our glasses were never empty and each course was timed perfectly to come out shortly after the next (a tricky task as I am known to be an epically slow eater). 

The food was so amazing and comforting without being too heavy. The pre fixe menu offered a choice of appetizer, main, and dessert. As my appetizer I had the prosciutto and parmesan croquettes. There was a small morsel of prosciutto hidden in the center of a creamy parmesan, all in a perfectly fried breading. I have no idea how they achieved the texture and complex flavor in those little morsels with just three ingredients, but they were heavenly. I hope this is on the regular menu as I'd love to order it again. My hubby had the butternut squash soup, which he said he'd get again.

For the main meal, I chose the chicken parmesan over mashed potatoes with greens. I've had a lot of chicken parm, but never with such a satisfyingly crunchy breadcrumb crunch. The perfect amount of sauce and good quality mozzarella topped it off. The mashed potatoes were the perfect texture and a nice compliment to the chicken. The greens were greens. My hubby had pork shoulder over bacon polenta and deemed it very tasty. I almost never finish my dinner and I cleaned the plate!

The pistachio cheesecake rounded out the meal. I rarely order dessert and usually take one or two bites then share the rest, but I kept this entire plate to myself! It reminded me of a pistachio pudding dish that my mom used to make for pot lucks, which upped the comfort level. It was creamy and smooth, minimal sweetness and lots of pistachio flavor. Would honestly go back just to order this for dessert!"}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday party about a week ago. He picked it based on hearing good reviews and I was excited to try it! We had a large party of about 10. The whole experience was full of ups and downs, and overall just mediocre. The good was the cheese board and the soup. The cheese board had a nice variety with in depth explanation and recommendations (kudos for that!) The bad was our server and her attention to the table. She seemed very bothered to be serving a large table and took a while to come back each time. Her facial expressions were not well hidden and we al picked up on her annoyance. I asked her if I could have a dessert brought out for my friend at the end of our meal, and instead it came out with the entrees. The ugly was my friend's entree. He ordered a pasta dish with pork. The meal was disgusting, for lack of a better word. The pasta was cold, the sauce was thin and cold, and the pork was mostly fat. After waiting so long for service, he decided to just pick at what he could instead of sending it back (as to not further annoy our server). 

The rest of the group enjoyed their entrees and I think the overall experience could have been much better with a different server."}
{"text":"Delicious swordfish (stuffed with tapenade, served over a tomato polenta cake). My husband had the Bollito Misto, which was amazing if you have a gigantic appetite. The beef in the dish was the best part, so if you're looking for something a little less overwhelming, I'd go for the braised beef. The antipasti selections were very good; we were especially drooling over the cabbage, which was delicious with the pecorino romano. Ending the meal with an espresso is a delicious treat--make sure to request the brown sugar cubes!"}
{"text":"Came here several times and want to really love this place. Every other Zack Bruell restaurant I've been to is exceptional and this one has a few highlights but falls short of the others. 

Good:
Location - East 4th is a Cleveland gem
Service - everything you would expect from Zack Bruell
Happy Hour - They have Happy Hour!
\"Exotic\" food - octopus check, clam bellies check, squid check etc.
Bar - great wine and cheese spreads at the bar

Bad:
Value - not the best, some items are great, others overpriced for the experience
Happy Hour - ordered almost everything off the menu and with the exception of the meatballs, everything was somewhat bland
Inconsistent - the first time I ordered the grilled octopus it was tender, well-seasoned, and the best I've ever had. The second time it was mushy, under-seasoned, and lukewarm

All-in-all worth coming to but not a destination. If you're in the area you can do a lot worse (I'm looking at you Zocalo!) but don't come in expecting L'Albatros and you might be content."}
{"text":"Went to Chinato for a good friend's birthday the other night and we were sooo impressed by EVERYTHING! The wait staff made great food recommendations, especially hard when working with me being a vegetarian. The food was delivered in a timely manner, the atmosphere was great..music a bit loud, but was turned down while we were there.
Try the artichoke appetizer~yum! The portions were perfectly sized and the menu had so many options that you are sure to find something that you crave."}
{"text":"Had such a great experience here tonight for a business dinner with my colleagues. We started with a cheese board which was really an experience! You get to choose from a cart of cheeses and the cheeses are explained to you. We particularly enjoyed the water buffalo milk cheese and a cheese which had a grey ash on the outside that tasted like truffles. 

The staff was very polite and attention. Front of the house, run by Julian, was seamless. My table ordered gnocchi, seafood cannelloni, beef, and pork cheek. Everyone enjoyed the food. One of my coworkers even took a photo of his dish because he was impressed by it. We spent roughly 2.5 hours here and never felt rushed. Time passed easily. 

We also ordered some desserts and the apple cheesecake was the clear favorite. The atmosphere in the upstairs dining room was warm and inviting. It seemed our out of town business guests (from Pittsburgh) really enjoyed themselves. I would recommend this restaurant. Thanks Chinato!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever. They should stick with plain bread. Idk how you can call nasty stuck together ramen noodles \"linguine\". And I think they took a play from Orange is the New Black season 2 and used the ramen spice packets for seasoning. So so salty and gross. The cheese plate is also super nasty. I think they store it in an old moldy, back room. The bread and fries were good. If you're thinking about going, don't. Go around the corner to Red instead and actually enjoy the meal. People were nice. Temp was WAY too cold. I should have brought a blanket. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the restaurant 2 weeks ago by accident when attending an international training event held at the Quicken arena. It was within walking distance. The staff was very friendly. I ordered a potato and cauliflower pizza that was delish. Not the combination you would try? . Hey expand your horizonsLOL. My ginger ale with lemon and lime was the best I have ever tasted. That is my drink of choice. The olive oil that they serve with most amazing bread is made by the owner. I should have brought a bottle but I didn't want to have a problem with TSA trying to bring it back. This olive oil was beyond compare. Since I was in a rush to get to a team meeting I had to get something fast or else I would have ordered other items.  Nice decor.  I will be back again.  My friend had the mussels which were also a real hit."}
{"text":"This was a business dinner and we had various full plates of pastas as appetizers. These were unusual renditions of tradition Italian dishes and very good. The bread was top notch and served with an oil. 

I had the Walleye and it was served over a cod mash potatoes that was fried. The Walleye was good but not anything special, the mash potatoes were very interesting but not to my liking. I am sure other people will rave about it. Just not my combination. 

The de-boned chicken leg looked very good and I was told it was. Some of the other meals around the table looked equally good. I would go there again."}
{"text":"ate there twice on recent visit to cleveland.  

PROS: awesome burger/fries.  good beer and wine choices.  nice decor.  nice bar area with huge windows.  great location on 4th st.  reasonable prices for the type of place it is. 

CONS:  salads.  WAY too much going on with the salads and they were okay at best.  desert (chocolate mousse) was just okay.  

and overall, i didn't like the menu.  too much going on.  i am believer - especially at restaurants - that jacks of all trades are masters of none.  
i suppose its unfair to judge things i didnt eat, but whatever, that's my impression."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to write a review for Chinato yet, since last Saturday was my first experience there and we didn't really try too many of the menu items. We just went in for a light dinner before a concert. Like I said, it was prime time -- just before 7 pm on a Saturday night. We tried Butcher & the Brewer and Greenhouse Tavern first and were told the wait would be at least one and a half hours. I was beginning to panic, but we walked in to Chinato, and were greeted warmly by the hostess, despite it being a busy night. She seated us immediately on the condition we'd be done by 8, which was no problem for us. 

Anyway, the service at Chinato is what inspired the writing of this review. Bruell's restaurants are known for their spot-on service, so I guess I'm not really bringing up anything new here but honestly I don't think my grandmother could have taken better care of us. We weren't there to rack up a huge bill -- we ordered a cheese tray and we each ordered the smaller portion of a different pasta dish. And one drink each. That was really all we had time for, and it ended up being all I had room for. We ate so. much. cheese. They don't just carve up some cheese in the back and bring it out to you on a rustic-looking wood board. They have a dude devoted to the cheese selection, so when you order a cheese board he'll come by with his tray of a dozen or so cheeses. He asked us about our preferences and gives a little description of each one, and after a lot of deliberation we decided on five. Pretty cool presentation -- and every cheese we tried was unique.

My point is that the wait staff treated us no differently for being a rather small check -- which SHOULD be the norm, but unfortunately I've experienced the opposite at other restaurants. I've been plenty of places where, at the first sign of thriftiness, the service plummets. Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and enthusiastic, not to mention very considerate of our schedule. We were running low on bread when the cheese service came around, and so we asked if we could just get a few more pieces. We were asked if we wanted bread or crostinis. We said crostinis would be fine, and they appeared seconds later, in addition to another basket of bread. We also had trouble deciding which pasta dishes we wanted, and our waiter directed us to his two favorites, both of which turned out to be phenomenal. 

I've been to Cowell & Hubbard, Parallax and several times to L'Albatros, but this by far my favorite Bruell experience, even though it was short. I am very excited to go back and get a better feel for the menu."}
{"text":"It was our second time eating here. The first time was quite tasty, from our pasta dishes to the soup, and the service. 
The second time was quite horrible, from the food to the service. So for now, three stars. Inconsistent. Probably won't be back for awhile however."}
{"text":"Go for the Brick Chicken! Really tasty. Good Italian food. Good ambience."}
{"text":"Laura was outstanding. Swordfish was excellent and it came with a lemon caper cream sauce. Also the ravioli was great as well. We substituted the butter sauce for the marinara sauce. 

Bread was freshly baked and a very good beer and wine selection. I highly recommend Chnato!

There is a separate dining room in the basement area."}
{"text":"Just went here last night... 
Our waitress was excellent! The wine list isn't that great in my opinion.. But that's okay! The menu has some very unique things for those of you who are adventurous!! 
Luckily, our waitress was fairly knowledgable about gluten free and was able to help me out! I had the salmon and it was out of this world!! 
Sure it's a little pricey, but it was great service and food! However, I was told a lot of their dishes are premade (like the risotto..)  and that lost them one star."}
{"text":"Stellar happy hour at the bar.  Only eat there during HH but priced and quality are great.  Usually not crowded and a good way to check out the place on a budget.

Bartenders are top notch and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this restaurant quite a few times in the last couple years especially since it's easy to make a quick reservation on Open Table, you can grab dinner and drinks at the bar and it's us located so close to the Q/Progressive Field. In the last year we have noticed a decline in the food. My husband's favorite gnocchi dish has been literally watered down and the gnocchi themselves have more a vacuumed-sealed quality. We went there last night and I ordered the swordfish. The consistency of this was so off that I questioned whether it was swordfish. I've had a few meals where capers accented the dish...be ready to taste nothing but capers. Bummer, it was a good run. They are dead to me now."}
{"text":"Chinato. Italian for too many god damn choices!!! 

Yeah I get it, Zack Bruell was inspired. He traveled to Italy to bring back examples of \"real\" Italian food that has lacked in this red sauce and spaghetti dominated city for all too long. But at some point, I think Chef Bruell bit off just a tad too much in his venture judging by his overaggressive menu. The menu is an encyclopedia of authentic Italiano cuisine broken into eight categories: Crudo, Antipasti, Salads, Pasta, Entrees, Pizza, Contorni and Dessert. An overbearing amount of choices.

I really think there's something to be said for simplicity. Pick a few things and do it well. Over-complicating the issue can lead to an unfocused product and an overwhelmed customer. I consider myself a fairly well-rounded diner with an above average grasp of cuisines of all types and I was dizzy after considering the nearly endless amount of choices on this menu. In the end, I surrendered to the hands of our waiter and his recommendations.

To start, we shared the Supplì al Telefono which were stuffed rice balls with a tomato sauce. Next, I had the Zuppa di Pesce, a fish stew consisting of clams, mussels, shrimp and a red sauce broth. I found the depth in this stew lacking and probably not something I'd order again. For dessert, the Lemon Pollenta Cake, which was the star of the night. 

Overall, I don't think Chinato is as focused, nor is it yet the masterfully executed food haven as Bruell's other two well-oiled machines, L'Albatros and Paralllax. Perhaps someday it will get there, but the food and ambiance didn't blow me away at Chinato like it did at L'Albatros. If Bruell's three restaurants were the 1927 Yankees, Chinato would be Bob Meusel. Certainly not Babe Ruth or Lou Gehrig, but Meusel did still hit for average and together, they form quite the formidable team."}
{"text":"I went there with my parents visiting from out of town and got stuck in the basement.  To be fair, I asked to change my reservation kind of last minute, but i wasn't aware the switch to the basement meant I lost all the vibe of the restaurant and that I wouldn't be able to hear because of a lot of people being in the room with atrocious acoustics. 

That aside, the food took forever but was decent. We got a calamari appetizer that was very well cooked and flavored and smashed it.  Then we got out main dishes which were all good but none spectacular. 

My entree was the pork saltimbocca and I wasmoderately happy with it., worth the price if only to try.  Taking into account the overall experience and price of chinato, I probably won't be going back any time soon, there are still a lot of other restaurants I want to try in this price range and nothing about this one has me hankering to come back."}
{"text":"It looks great until it is time to dine. We were surprised as it definitely not your average Italian. Don't expect standard pasta dishes. This did not bother us. I ordered the brick flattened chicken. My wife chose the stuffed swordfish with risotto. The swordfish came very rare. After a second try the fish was still rare and the risotto was  very pasty. It was sent back for a quick spaghetti which is not on the menu. My chicken came in grilled with a hard shell on both sides and a small chopped salad. The potatoes that were supposed to be hidden under the chicken were not present. I cannot imagine how they could have hidden many potatoes under the small piece of chicken. To the credit of the restaurant they did get a side of potatoes for me and did comp the spaghetti. It was a very disappointing meal. I could not ever return."}
{"text":"For the area and price point, Chinato was a mediocre restaurant. While the menu sounds great on paper, I feel as if all of the presentations I saw didn't live up to the hype. I personally ordered the special they had for the night which was a 24 oz bone-in ribeye. Especially with the Florentine steak they had on the menu, I was expecting this steak to be quite good, but I ended up with an exactly mediocre steak.

Don't get me wrong, this place isn't bad. The ambiance is nice and the location is great... but that is the problem. With other great restaurants in the area and the price point, I think you'd be better served going to Lola."}
{"text":"Great food & selection of wine.

Loved the interior and the atmosphere.

Great, attentive service.

I tried the Bollito Misto upon reading the yelp reviews...
It's SOUPY & MEATY (pork, chicken, beef, lamb, sausage all slow-cooked in one dish) 

Beware if you're not a fan of lamb though..
i couldn't overcome the lamb smell so i sadly had to stop eating after a couple bites....

That was my fault though for not knowing about the lamb part.

Everyone else in my group enjoyed their food. 
Heard the steak dish for 2 people wasn't THAT great though.

I'd recommend you try something different. something more exotic.
they have some daring dishes here."}
{"text":"This place was really great. We had a party of 9, the servers were great and took time to explain all the menu items, and all of us left with full bellies and happiness. The daily special soup was amazing (broccoli cheedar, seriously the best ever), the mushroom pizza was good (though not thin crust), the flattened chicken was amazing, the marinara sauce-based homemade pasta was to die for, the atmosphere was really great for a big group to carry on a conversation while enjoying the food, and the wine list was extensive. The only downside was that with a group of 9 who wanted separate checks, we had to spend about 20 minutes figuring out our bills, which was a minor annoyance though somewhat understandable with a nice restaurant I suppose. Overall, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"the food here is amazing, the interior is gorgeous, the staff is very friendly- i never thought i'd say this about a place but maybe even a little too over attentive? our bread plate was never empty, nor was our oil for the bread, or water. i feel in some way the over attentiveness almost made it feel like i had to rush through my meal when i really wanted to just sit there and enjoy it. but, who complains about good service? the food was impeccable- we had the scallops(very small portion), octopus salad (amazing!), pappardelle with creamed cauliflower(still craving till this day), and the sauteed cotechino sausage(not my dish, cant remember ha).  the cocktail i got. *margarita?* was also pretty good&stiff. love this place, definately recommend it."}
{"text":"My service here was extremely slow, when we ordered our appetizer it was well over cooked couldnt even finish it and then my entree was undercooked. I have eaten all over cleveland but this place i wouldnt go back, I would of rather eaten at Olive Garden for italian food."}
{"text":"It's a Zack Bruell restaurant, so the expectations were high.

I hit up a happy hour at Chinato. The appetizers were on a discount and the wine was decently priced. I ordered a glass of red and the gnocchi, while my other half ordered the margherita pizza and a glass of red as well.

Honestly, I love the ambiance of the front bar. It's laid out well, the vibe is chill, and the help was great.

Now for the food. I love gnocchi, and if it's on the menu, I order it. I didn't find the gnocchi at Chinato to be anything special, which is a surprise, as I love every other restaurant concept Zack Bruell has brought to this city. The pizza was to die for though, and the red wine hit the spot. We ordered 2 glasses a piece.

Aside from the gnocchi, the experience at Chinato was brilliant. I will definitely be going back, but maybe for a fancy dinner one night, so I can taste the whole menu."}
{"text":"Good service, food tasted great, nice atmosphere, well dressed and mostly attentive staff."}
{"text":"Chinato is always delicious. We went last week for Happy Hour. I enjoy that the bar area has tables you can sit at , and it's not just seating at the bar that is included. I was waiting for friends so I didn't have anybody come to the table except for with bread and water for a good 10 minutes. Finally just went to the bar to get my drink. I don't mind doing that, it was just I asked and was told somebody would be by."}
{"text":"We walked in early on a Saturday, the weekend of Valentine's Day and a cavs game later in the evening. We didn't have reservations because it was an impromptu visit. They said they could seat us, but we only had an hour and 15 minutes to have our table because then they needed it for reservations. Kind of awkward to put a time limit on our stay, but we understood and were well taken care of without feeling too rushed.

We skipped appetizers and each ordered a salad. I really loved my arugula salad. I also had a half portion of the gnocchi. It was alright, but considering we honeymooned in Italy and had very authentic dishes, my expectations weren't super high. 

The service was great. We never felt rushed. My party loved their dishes, I felt like mine was just okay. I'm giving 4 stars though because they took such good care of us!"}
{"text":"Met the girls before heading to see a show in Playhouse square. Ordered a variety of apps and a girly cocktail. All very scrumptious and well priced. Will def be back for a dinner date in the future..."}
{"text":"Very sophisticated menu.  Difficult to find an ordinary dish.  If you seek high end food this is the place. Wasn't for me though.  

Nice people though. I'm sure very good Paring restaurant."}
{"text":"This was bad food at a high price. Salad was ok but nothing great and cost $10. All three of our party found our food to be bad. My linguine with clams was very salty; my husband had ravioli that was just ok but cost $20 and my son had pasta carbonara that had pancetta that looked like chunks of pork fat. Very expensive and unsatisfying meal. They may have certain entrees that they specialize in but we obviously didn't order it."}
{"text":"As you can see from my many check-ins, I have long been a frequent flyer here. I still like what I like about it, but as Zack Bruell's empire has grown, his older restaurants have shown signs of strain. Here, that means inconsistencies in food and service. Dishes that were the same year after year have sometimes come out with disappointing errors in seasoning and cook time. Friendly faces that I've gotten to know have gone elsewhere. I think I gotta find a new go-to joint downtown."}
{"text":"A group of us from Colorado and Florida who work together were a little lost and hungry. We happened upon this restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised. The gnocchi I had was well prepared and flavorful. Two of my friends got the special with tilapia fish. It looked beautifully presented and they both said it was fantastic. My other friend had scallops and loved them too. We were so happy with our meals we had dessert too. My hazelnut chocolate mousse and my friend's pistachio gelato were very good. If you live in Cleveland or are traveling there for work, very nice place to eat. Good service. Nice ambiance. Loved the full wall picture of the Florence skyline. :-) Thanks for a lovely meal."}
{"text":"Found Chinato via Yelp as we wanted something walking distance from our hotel in Cleveland.  Very nice food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Went to a Cavs game with my daughter and thought we would grab dinner near the arena.  Yelped and found Chinato mentioned.  The food was very good I had the fettuccine carbonara while my daughter had the Slake.  We both enjoyed our meals, I also had a glass of Chianti Classico which was quite nice.

Not the least expensive of places but I would say it was in the moderate range.  With my glass of wine and the tip it ran us about $80.  

We sat downstairs which was like eating in the cellar.  Not dirty or anything bad just not a fancy decor.  It was also quite noisy due to the low ceilings. 

All in all, a good place for dinner conveniently located near the Quicken Arena."}
{"text":"We dined here on Saturday evening, with another couple. The group as a whole, came to the same conclusion... it was ok.
The service was the part that set it off for us. The waiter was either, too busy, or completely uninterested in serving us. We had to pull information out of him, regarding wine, regarding specials, regarding recommendations. The hostess did seat us without including a wine list,.. odd. Another funny thing was... so it took about 15 minutes to get water and bread service. Here is this bread guy walking around with a giant bread basket, except we had to beg for bread. Carry a smaller basket if you don't want us to break bread. The waiter didnt write anything down, and we knew he would mess up our order... for sure he did, leaving out one pork dish. At least they didn't charge us.
After desert, we were brought the check, is if it was Dennys.. we didn't ask for the check.
All in all... interesting, this place is just o.k.
Dining out just seems to fall short in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Came here around 5:30pm ish before heading to the Ed Sheeran concert. 

We were a party of 2 - my sister and I - and we were seated right away into the basement. 

Drink orders were taken right away but it took them forever to get bread for the table and then it took some more time- like a really long long long time to get our order in with our server and then even more time to get our food. 

We waited and waited while the bread server totally ignored us as he served the table next to us who were seated after us. While other tables didn't have to ask for bread, we had to ask for it. I am not sure why since it was clear that we didn't get any. Maybe the servers are blind? Maybe racist? Maybe sexist? Whatever the case was, we waited a very long time for everything. The restaurant wasn't crowded but they should've expected a Saturday night rush especially with an Indians game just ending and a concert taking place in the same day. 

We finally got our order of burrata, bucatini with rock shrimp in lobster broth, and braised pork cheek in with our server, Jimmy.  Again, the process of asking our order took forever. Maybe the servers are blind? Maybe racist? Maybe sexist? I don't know what the deal was but it took just as long to get our foods. The table next to us ordered after us and they got their food way before us. 

When we finally got our food, the biggest disappointment was the bucatini with rock shrimp in lobster broth. It was bland. The whole thing was blah. Which is odd since it is an Italian restaurant. How can you claim that you are an Italian restaurant when I'm pretty sure the water you cook the pasta in has more flavoring than the lobster broth? And I'm Korean- I'm pretty sure I can make better pasta than the atrocity that the \"Italian\" restaurant served us. 

Our braised pork cheek was salty but at this point- about waiting an hour for our food- we were starving and ate the entire dish out of hunger. 

The GM finally made way to our table to take the bucatini off our tab but tried to point out that the broth is watery and not a thick sauce. Umm we are aware of the difference between broth and sauce but thanks for that. 

Either way, it was bad food, horrendous service and I would never ever come back nor recommend coming to this \"Italian\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Caveat: This was my first time at a contemporary 'foodie' (I concur with a review written earlier by Rachel B.) Italian restaurant. However, I've visited Mr. Bruell's (the chef) other places about 4-5 times so I have at least a modicum of familarity with his restaurants and have had excellent experiences in all of my previous visits. 

As expected, the food was excellent. Pasta dishes are offered in two sizes (~$20 and ~$10). I had 2 smaller portions (La Boco $9, Fetticune Carbonera, $9). The fetticune carbonera sauce was rich and had hunks of sausage. The pork in La Boco was tender with no fat. Their size, each the size of my fist, were slightly disappointing. Everyone else in my party was very satisfied with their food, although the server did bring out an incorrect order for one of them nor did our server apologize for it [in retrospect, it sounds pretty, but any place can be courteous]. 

Their service with our wine orders was disappointing. Shortly after arriving, we ordered a bottle of wine. Several minutes later, our server arrived to tell us they were out of our selection and had a different bottle in hand, in similar price and style and we ordered it. As we were served our entrees, we ordered another bottle of the replacement wine. A while later, our server came back and apologized they had ran out of that replacement bottle as well. By the time that they had come back to tell this and offer us a 3rd option, we were nearly done with our entrees. Granted, I have not worked in the restaurant industry, but I've learned that if a party of 6 is sharing a bottle of wine, it's expected the server should ensure there are at least 2 additional bottles for the party before serving the first bottle and have the bottles readily accessible. Another member of my party is a server at one of Mr. Bruell's other restaurants and was also disappointed in the service. 

I'm unsure whether to give 2 or 3 stars since this was my first time at a very contemporary Italian restaurant such as this. However, I've experienced much better service my other times at Zach's restaurants, so I've seen better."}
{"text":"If you can figure out the menu (it's true Italian where there are words other than spaghetti and penne pasta) it's delicious! I got a cheese penne(like) dish with pork sausage and it was delicious! Even reheated it was good for a leftover dinner. I also had the Tuscan onion soup which was a big serving. Cute atmosphere, slow service but I'd be back! Maybe to try the beef tongue... Maybe not..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. 

They have a great happy hour specials, which is normally when I come in. Typically they have a $5 specialty cocktail which is almost always good. Their happy hour food servings have never disappointed. Service and the bartenders have always been fantastic as well. I will continue to be coming here for a long time!"}
{"text":"Olive oil cake is delicious.  Calamari is excellent.  Great service, waiters are very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Chinato was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Everything was delicious, our server was attentive and informative and you could really tell they knew what they were doing. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the Brussel sprout appetizer was infused with so many different flavors, I wanted a second plate! I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I'm feeling generous today and one of the reasons is the fantastic dinner I had at Chinato on Saturday night.  Of course before arriving I read a number of Yelp reviews and did my research online with regards to a lot of the dishes on the menu that I may not have understood being put on the spot at the time of ordering.  I can honestly say that early preparation made a big difference, even our waiter Brian was impressed as he was prepared to give us a 5 minute instructional run down of the menu.

So....drinks...ahhh....Alison (pregnant) really wanted a sip of wine so I ordered a Cab blend that was recommended by Brian.  The wine was great with everything that we ate, even though we didn't properly pair it, both the dishes and the wine held their own so intertwining the flavors was not even on my mind.

Our strategy going into the dinner was to not overeat as we were heading to a hockey game afterward and needed to make room for some arena-fare.  I thought that getting an appetizer, small pasta to share, and two dinner entrees would suffice, Brian whole-fully agreed.  So...here is the breakdown.

App - Supplì al telefono $7.00 - Yelp recommendation and a terrific one!!  We both absolutely loved these risotto balls.  Already planning to come back just to sit at the bar and get these.  Risotto, seemed tomato basil based, rolled, deep fried, and rolled again in what I believe was Parmesan dust.

Pasta - Linguine with baby clams, calamari and scallions $9.00 - This was just OK.  I thought the calamari was overcooked and a little rubbery, but the tentacles were fine.  I also believe the noodles were al dente, could have used a little more time on the skillet.  Broth was butter, lemon, wine, clam sauce? based but was good with the bread that is continually brought to your table.  I will get a different pasta next time.

Dinner (Jeff) - Chicken Legs \"saltimbocca\" style $17.00 - Phenomenal comfort dish!  I absolutely devoured this thing.  It's basically two seasoned chicken legs slow roasted, bone removed, stuffed with cheese, and flash fried to crisp the skin.  These legs were then placed on a bed of kale, polenta, and some sort of sauce / gravy that went perfectly with the dish.  All this topped with another green that I couldn't remember, too much dinner bliss at this point. 

Dinner (Alison) - Stuffed Swordfish with olive paste $20.00 - Alison and I both really enjoyed this dish.  It was more of a stack then a stuff.  Bottom layer was deep fried polenta, next layer was grilled swordfish, then arugula, olive paste with kalamatas, another sword filet, and then topped with a little drizzle of a sauce, balsamic it seemed, and some greens.  This dish went beautifully when tasted together or separate.  I really loved the flavor the grill gave the sword, nicely seasoned.  Would definitely get again.  The olive paste doesn't make it too salty, just know that its there before you order.

Desert - None Needed

Overall - Great dinner, period.  Service (Brian) was always attentive but never annoying, waters always full, dishes cleared properly (time and fashion), the atmosphere was comforting / fun, and all in all I thought the bill fit the dinner perfectly.  Under $100 for what we both agreed were totally fantabulous meals, those that deserve a made up word like fantabulous.  So stop hesitating, its not as dressy appropriate as you might think.  There is always the bar area with tables that seem a little more laid back.   Not at all what either of us expected but in a very good way."}
{"text":"This is just a review of their happy hour..have not actually had a full dinner yet. However have been to the happy hour twice now and enjoy it. Its 4:30-630 and then they have a reverse one again just before close. Happy hour is just in the bar and the service is still pretty good. 
The HH menu is primarily vegetarian, but still with quite a few delicious options. We tried almost everything on the menu....my 2 favorite were probably the margherita pizza and the mushroom polenta (and I usually don't like eating veg!) The gnocchi was also pretty good. I didn't try the meatball but was told it was good (made of lamb, veal and pork). The antipasta salumi platter was just so so--too many pickled vegetables not enough of everything else. 

Drinks were great...I tried one of the house cocktail and one of the house wine...both well made. For as much food as we got was definitely affordable. 
I would definitely recommend the HH and will likely be back for a full dinner!"}
{"text":"First the Décor has a great vibe to it. Mix of modern materials with and old world feel and everything comes together clean. Some points off for crammed seating though in some sections, as it's not far off from the cafeteria at grade school. At least there are no tater tots on the menu. 

The menu is huge. Most items are good to great. Meats are juicy and tender and pasta's are well prepared. The Gnocchi nocks it out of the park though, I will not waver from that from now on. 

Service is usually excellent....Always prompt, friendly and great bus service.  Might not be the most knowledgeable, which is understandable considering the huge wine list and menu. Still I would rather take prompt and nice over  a slow rude server who just happens to know how salty Soppressata is. My only complaint ever is I received a voice message to confirm a reservation and call back (which is strange in itself) , only to be hung up on when I did call back.  It's 5PM weekday reservation we're talking about here, I did not realize that would require me to play \"India call center\". . Ah Well.

Price is up there, but you get what you pay for. If you hit up Happy hour though, the value makes it 5*"}
{"text":"You should not go unless you have a reservation. We went unplanned b/c we were in the area. And granted it's a nice basement, but you kind of feel second class getting relegated to the basement. Sitting next to a flat screen playing college basketball doesn't scream fine dining. But maybe that's my fault b/c the rest of this review is positive. Our food was cooked very well. Great flavors and selection (meatless friendly options, etc.). I had the delicious sea scallops in lobster sauce (I only got three though). I think I would have preferred traditional gnocchi as opposed to the semolina, they were a bit doughy. But they did soak up the sauce well, so maybe that's why, obviously Zack Bruell knows more than I do. My wife liked her risotto. The service was professional. But for the price there are better Italian options not far away."}
{"text":"They had great service and a fantastic array of gluten free options. Gluten free bread was brought out with the rest of the regular bread and I loved their linguine (with gf pasta) with a lobster cream sauce and scallops. It was so flavorful and everything came out in a reasonable time. This is definitely five stars because of the gluten free options and it's great atmosphere. The wait staff was very knowledgeable about food allergies and everything tasted good! We had a party of 8 and it was still great service. Recommend to anybody! It is a bit pricey though."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the whole Zack Bruell thing that's happening in Cleveland, but I think Chinato probably has the best happy hour downtown. 

We had some pizza, gnocchi, charcuterie and a few Peroni on the bar-side before a game and I was pleasantly surprised with the service (pleasant and quick), the price and the number of people that were there, it was crowded but shy of ridiculous."}
{"text":"Paid a lot of money, spent a lot of time at Chinato tonight. Was this a really bad night night?  I felt like I was in the twilight zone at your restaurant Zach and staff.  Having been a bartender, server, prep cook, I want to be empathetic. This experience was truly disappointing....Next time you keep people waiting forever for food, comp some apps or wine... jeez...Restaurant management 101. Onwards to the evening's problems; poor timing, poor communication, confusion, aloof servers, food that was not hot, arriving at the table... So, here goes; we finished our lovely bottle of wine before we received our starters. yes, we enjoyed our wine, but, we (3 people) savored it in 5 oz pours that took an hour  and a few minutes to finish overall. In that time, we had our anti-pasti plate and 30 minutes later our shared pasta dish arrived--not hot. The dish was still enjoyed and when we pointed the temperature issue out the server he simply commented , ' you enjoyed it though, right ?\"...there in lies the problem or rather, one of the problems.  At this point we are then concerned about how the rest of the evening will \"pan\"out.  So, as diners, our attention is shifting from  enjoying each others conversation at our table towards looking around at other tables and staff and examining the dynamics surrounding us thus impacting our relaxation. I have to credit some of the staff for their noticing this and stopping by to see if they could help, but, unfortunately , they had little information to impart, but, sympathetic smiles none the less. All in all, four hours later, one of the last tables to leave, two bottles of wine consumed, my party headed out into the cold dark cleveland night on 4th street.."}
{"text":"Home in Cleveland for a week, our plans to go to the Indians game were dashed by rain, so we decided to try out Chinato, Zack Bruell's Italian joint in downtown. As someone who is not typically a fan of Italian fare, I was quite impressed by Chinato overall. We had two appetizer plates, the Suppli al Telefono and the fried artichoke hearts. Both were really nice, and pretty light on my palate despite being fried. We were particularly impressed by the artichokes (a little salty for me, honestly). For dinner I had the Beef braised in Amarone with polenta. It was very good, although there was a heck of a lot of polenta on the plate, which pulled some of the flavor out of the beef, which was basically a short rib. The polenta was simple and good, but fell a tad on the salty side. For dessert, I tried some pistachio cheesecake and some chocolate mousse cake, and both were great, the cheesecake especially. It's a flavor profile I haven't had before, and it was memorable. Overall, this was a great meal that had a few shortcomings in the entree department. Really wonderful appetizers and desserts. I have no complaints at all about the service-- I remember being pleasantly surprised at the short wait for our food, even with a decent crowd in the restaurant.

Overall, Chinato is definitely worth a try. Pretty reasonably priced menu too; there is definitely a lot of worse food on East 4th that will cost you pretty much the same."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. While the food was OK, it did not live up to our expectations. The gnocchi was good but not great. The carbonara pasta was more like a soup with how much sauce there was. We were excited to try this place but unfortunately we will not be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Chinato a few times and it is an average Italian restaurant. Nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either. It is great for lunch if you need to meet people downtown. 

On my last visit I ordered: Chicken Scallopine with fontina, roasted tomato, preserved lemon, fennel with tomato jam and micro greens salad

It was great and a good size for lunch."}
{"text":"I would like to give 3 1/2 stars but I couldn't do it so I simply rounded it. (They made a sit for  me - yes, 1 person - during the peak time and I personally had good experience with them) Their complementary bread was tasty - I got beef tongue which wasn't that bad but bit salty - got tiramisu (two thumbs up!) 

I wouldn't be crazy about the restaurant but if you are in town it is worth to check out."}
{"text":"I had the tagliatelle with braised tongue, lamb, and veal for lunch today and it was phenomenal.  I have never tried cow tongue before and just had to tried it. The portion was more than enough for two but I finished it all because it was too good.  Great sauace and flavor. The waiter was also on point. I will return."}
{"text":"The service, the food, and the atmosphere is spot on!!
We had the Garganelli with rabbit puttanesca and ricotta salata Appetizer. Followed by Sea scallops with semolina gnocchi, Broccolini Lobster sauce. With 2 Spiced Pear Mule drinks. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Oh Chinato, you taste TOO salty.

We stopped here before seeing Screwtape Letters at Playhouse Square. Love the decor and just the feel of this place- it's one of those places where you would want to have a networking event (great area downstairs for it), or just a nice dinner.

The table was nice and I was surprised the place was not packed at 5:30pm. We got a nice red wine to start (think it was a Syrah), and then ordered. The bread was okay that came out.

My friends got the scallops. Those looked AMAZING. Oh man, wish I had got that. I got the Col Buco after reading many of my fellow yelpers reviews. Did I like? OH NO, definitely not. BLEHHHHH. 

It was salty. The noodles were cooked too long. The sauce was just loaded with salt. And the meat..although it was good.. I think my mom can make slow roasted pork better than that too. Ugh. I ate half of it and felt my skin tightening. Pretty salty.

My friend got something even more extremely salt. He got the \"Garganelli with sweetbreads, giblets, radicchio, butter, parmesan and breadcrumbs\". I think he just wanted the sweetbread. I took a bite of his and it tasted twice as salty of mine. Double bleh.

Don't get me wrong. My other companions loved their meal. But for some reason....ours just didn't taste right at all. :P I was disappointed... maybe I\"ll come back just to try the dessert..... the dessert menu looks AMAZING."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this swanky little spot! The food is delicious and the service is on point. The house drinks are inventive, especially the tequila number (name slips my mind) I was sipping on! Definitely a great place to kick off a date night!

We started with the cheese board, and the selections were all delicious. I am always a sucker for a smelly ripe cheese, and they nailed it! The Scallops were cooked to perfection and could not have been any fresher. The gnocchi was on the fringe of flawless and the texture, oh the texture... perfection! 

We were running a few minutes late to an event, so we had to pass on dessert, but I am certain we would have been pleased!"}
{"text":"Sad to say that Chinato was not as good on the return trip. Wish Yelp would let us give 0.5 star ratings, because I thought it was a 3.5 this time. I'm still holding desperately onto keeping Chinato as my happy spot in Cleveland, because it has potential. 

To recap tonight's visit... we arrived late since we couldn't find parking. There's always some special event going on downtown. We managed to find street parking maybe two blocks away. Yay! 

Had plenty of people pay attention to us during dinner. Water never left unfilled, bread kept coming. The only thing I have to complain about service, which I would have never noticed in the past, but due to watching too much Robert Irvine on Restaurant Impossible... noticed that one of the servers were not very delicate in putting down serving utensils, appetizer plates, filling water... nonetheless, not too big of a concern. Food came fairly quickly; I think we got the drink within 2 minutes of ordering, and appetizer came just as we were finishing off our first two pieces of bread. Note, if you don't like the salt that they put on the table for the bread, the butter that you can ask for is pretty tasty too. 

Drinks: BF ordered the Peroni beer. Big glass of beer for $5. He said it was good.. forgot what he said about the rest. 

Appetizers: we ordered the gnocchi (still just as good, bites of heaven; I forgot how the parmasan shavings added a nice bite and contrast to the creamy dough). Also ordered mussels.. huge plate of mussels. BF was unfortunately not a fan of the mussels (but he doesn't like fish... and said the mussels were more fishy than he remembered eating at other restaurants). Thus, had to finish the whole plate of mussels by myself, and left the rest of the gnocchi to BF. SAD. Need to go again sometimes just for the gnocchi. The mussels were good, but after 5 mussels.. you kind of want to just stop eating them. I think they were steamed rare or something; just thought they could have been cooked more.

Entrees: We both ordered the chicken saltimbocca since we had such a phenomenal experience last time. Sadly... it was not as good as when we went in October. I went and looked at some other Yelp reviews, and it seems that after our visit in October, people have been complaining about the polenta being too runny, and not just the polenta in the chicken dish, but also some beef polenta too. Sad. I remember last time, the chicken had a really crispy skin, and the kale was also yummy and crispy. This time, the polenta made it mushy. Also, a little salty, but I'm not sure if that's just because I am a light salt eater. 

What made me bump my 3.5 to a 4 were the following factors:
1) They had live entertainment today! There was a band of 3 men playing Italian music on accordian, violin, and some other instrument. So lovely sounding. Made me feel right like I was in Italy. 
2) The manager stopped by. I asked him if he was Zach Bruell... embarrassing, lol. He wasn't. Curious about the change in the chicken dish, I inquired, and he went back to the kitchen to find out why the chicken dish was so much more watery than last time. Turns out that they adjusted the water ratio or something, and they're trying to fix that issue now. Compensated us with a lemon polenta cake. I was looking forward to picking out a new dessert since we had that at the last visit, and since it was BF's birthday, would have wanted him to pick out a dessert that he would have liked. Fortunately, he said it tasted pretty good, and that it was better than last time, since the polenta wasn't gritty and dry. Seems like the extra water they put in the polenta worked out for the dessert! 

Will return again. I still have hope for Chinato! 

On a side note.. found out that Zach Bruell has a new restaurant??? Cowell and Hubbard, apparently close by Chinato's. Looking forward to trying that sometimes."}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriends for cleveland restaurant week. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice and upscaled, but the food quality didnt really match their \"goal.\" Maybe it's cuz we ordered food from the restaurant week menu, they were more careless about the quality, but my potatoes were too salty. Other appetizers and entrees that I ordered just felt that there was something missing, except that the salmon tartare was pretty good. They could really improve on their food quality."}
{"text":"Dined there last night for dinner. Everything was really great. I ordered the brick pressed chicken and it was definitely a good dish however the star of the show was the braised beef that my significant other got! It was amazing super tender and came with very delicious polenta!! I had a glass of wine that was good and they had great service. We finished the meal off with the cherry torta with chocolate gelato which was heavenly. Portions were big enough but definitely not large."}
{"text":"Another terrific restaurant on my Zakc Bruell tour of Cleveland.

Came for dinner Saturday night at 7:15 and was asked if we minded sitting outside, to which I promplty replied yes I do mind. (I didnt spend an hour on my dress and hair to sit on a sidewalk thank you) so the hostess found us a nice table inside. Thank you!

Perused the wine list and decided on my favorite Silver Oak Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon which really was fairly priced at $120. 

My dinner companion, who is less then adventurous, was under strict instructions to \"eat outside the box\" tonight. So for starters we had the beef tongue with sweet and sour eggplant. It was very good, I was interested in the eggplant make up and was not disappointed in the combinations of flavors. 

Moving onto our salad course my friend had the arugula salad with pumpkin seeds, goat cheese and turnips and ate every bite, I had the shaved mushroom salad, which is basically a large bol of shaved mushrooms but it's served with a lemony caper dressing and baby sprouts that added the perfect blend of zing and texture. I cant wait to make this one at home!

For dinner he opted for the veal breast with salsa verde and polenta. It looked delicious and he enjoyed it as well. I had to try the skate wing as I never had. It was  lightly fried with lemon and breadcrumbs and served with a panzanella salad. Very good, odd texture skate has, it's stringy to cut yet extremely delicate in your mouth,,,very interesting...also very good.

For dinner we opted to split the warm cherry tart with chocolate gelato as we both wanted \"just a bite\" of sweetness to finish off our meal. WELL, I had a bite, maybe two and said dinner companion devoured the rest of it and raved about it all night and the next day!

Dinner with wine and tip was about $250 and worth ever penny of it.  Service was exceptional, atmosphere was cozy and classy and dinner was superb."}
{"text":"Chinato is one of my Italian restaurants in town. The space is super convenient and located on E. 4th Street.  It's the perfect spot to start out a night downtown.  I have been here probably 20+ times and have always had great service.  The wine selection is superb and the cocktails are on point.  

The endless bread and olive oil with Himalayan sea salt is incredible.  I could gain 10 lbs just eating the bread alone.  My favorite dish (and what I get every time I come) is the gnocchi.  It is phenomenal and the portion is huge.  It tastes just as good reheated at home.  I also always start with the tomato bread soup which is mouthwatering good. My fiance always gets a different dish every time we go and he is always pleased.  Definitely check out Chinato if you have never been."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner at this Italian restaurant while visiting Ohio.  It is definitely not your traditional Italian restaurant.  Menu items were not your typical Italian items, well, unless you like tongue. It is also overpriced for the portion size that you receive.  I was hoping to enjoy some Italian pasta sauce, a variety of pasta, and Italian cheeses... No luck. 

As for service, it was mediocre at best. We were rushed- dinner came out in what felt like five minutes. 

Disappointing considering it was my first dining experience in Ohio. Thank goodness other places in the area made up for this experience."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago, the pasta was delicious. I tried a seafood dish that was mouth watering. If I'm back in the area I would definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Nice place on east 4th.  The food was good and we had a lot of fun with our waiter.  We got the snails and they were really tasty with a good sized serving.  The place was packed which is always a good sign and we left full and tipsy so I felt like It was a very successful night.  The carbonara - was so good.  It's not your traditional so be warned now, our waiter warned us... but It didn't scare us and we went for It any way and didn't regret It for a second.  We did a cheese plate, snails, and the carbonara between two girls and dessert.  It's very rare when I don't over eat  so It was a nice surprise.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"We went to Chinato last night to celebrate my Son's birthday.
To say we were happy with the service and meals would be an understatement.
We dined outside and were constantly fawned over by the service staff.
Our waiter, Brian, was very helpful in our wine and appetizer selections. 
My family is prone to sampling each others dishes, and that was highly prevalent during the entire meal.
3 appetizers, 4 entrees, 3 deserts, wine, 2 interesting craft beers, YUM!

Competition is tough in this neighborhood, but Chinato holds its own and we will return to sample other offerings on the menu.

Hint;
Don't be afraid to ask the servers for their suggestions.
Our server was spot on with every one of his suggestions!"}
{"text":"I've passed by Chinato many a times down East 4th during lunch and have never stopped in.  I've always assumed it was a little too pricy and stuffy for lunch.  However I was most pleasantly surprised when I stopped in with some work colleagues recently.

The service was top notch by our waitress Lisa and the rest of the front of house staff.  Lisa checked on us multiple times, our drinks never went empty and our plates where never left empty on the table too long.

Our meals came came out promptly and piping hot.  My risotto was delicious and the lunchtime portion was shocking large.  My colleagues ordered the chicken scaloppini and the braised beef - both were bites I tried were fantastic.

I will be for sure coming back for lunch again.  The prices for each of our meals averaged to about $20 a piece and frankly that was a steal for the service that we received and the huge portions presented to us."}
{"text":"I started with an appetizer of Buratta with caponata ($14). The portion was decent and could be shared comfortably between three people. Toast was served with the dish. On top of the caponata (chopped eggplant) was the Buratta (a unique style of mozzarella cheese). The eggplant was served cool and went great with the thick dollops of cheese. This is a nice light app to start with. 

For my main I got the Fettuccini carbonara. As all the pastas do, it came in a small and dinner portion size. I got the dinner size and found it to be a proper portion - not overwhelming. The creamy sauce of a more runny consistency was well flavored. I found the portion to be filling, but was not uncomfortably stuffed. 

Our sever was attentive and well informed on the menu. He offered additional descriptions of dishes and his opinion on his favorite drinks and entrees. Overall the meal experience moved really quickly. The kitchen was very fast as well.

*Do note that the Corn Fusilli pasta is not a gluten free dish. While the pasta is gluten free, the vegan sausage served with it has gluten in it. Why they would bother to use a gluten free pasta when the entire dish is not gluten free is strange. Do not order this if you are avoiding gluten for health reasons."}
{"text":"Holy Moses.....I got the the special Tomahawk Ribeye......it was amazing.  However, way too much food.  I used the BIG bone and left over meat and made some slow cooker brown beans.  Delicious!!!!!

This is an amazing place....staff are very friendly.  Sever never let my pop run out.  That is a task in itself.  lol 

Try it.....you'll love it......."}
{"text":"eh. 

decor was nice. menu, not so much. Wasn't so sure about what they were going for here. Descriptions were extremely vague, and some ingredients seemed a bit odd to pair with the others. 

pasta was clearly handmade, so cudos. But it was definitely underseasoned. 
Cold bread. no thanks. 
small, mediocre pizza. no thanks.

overall, wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Welcoming, and warm. Chinato is a gem among  the hustle & bustle of East Fourth St, 

Staff is accommodating and knowledgeable, everything is prepared fresh and timely, yet not rushed.
Consistent. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to get invited to the soft opening of Chinato and to no surprise.  So as always in the spirit of full disclosure I am slightly biased to Zack  Bruell's restaurants, however, I'm not afraid to criticize if I felt it necessary.  While this is only the second one I've been to, (the other being Parallax) I absolutely love what they do with food.  Chinato (pronounced Key-na-too) is no exception.  Don't expect to find your Americanized italian food here, as you'll be disappointed, if that is what your looking for.  The inspiration for the cuisine is Italian food like they do it in Italy, and to me that is just what Cleveland needs.

So first the decor, its a nice mix of modern and classic with an amazing mural along in the main dining area that stretches the length of the room of what I'd imagine is of some where in Italy.  The seating is intimate much like Parallax and I like that.  I sat in a booth but didn't feel overcrowded by those around me.

Next the appetizers, or Antipasti.  We tried the Salumi Platter and the Beef Tongue with Sweet and Sour Eggplant.  The Salumi platter aka salami was very tasty, although I had wished the server would have told us what the different kinds were or I should have asked.  Either way it was good, didn't blow me away but if you like salami its nice, go for it.  The beef tongue was unique, I hadn't had it before so I really don't know if it was good for beef tongue.  It had a very beefy flavor with an interesting texture.  I'm not a fan of eggplant to begin with those so that threw me off a bit.  I'd try it again though to give myself a better feel for it.  

On to the pasta and entrees.  For the pasta we had the Pappardelle with creamed cauliflower, pecorino and pepperoncini.  This pasta was very nice, it was slightly creamy, but not heavy, and a very nice spicy kick to it.  Gets my approval for sure.  The entrees were Beef Braised in Amarone with creamy polenta, Sea Scallops with pepperoncini, garlic oil and roasted potatoes and Sweetbread Fritto Misto with fried caper berries, carrot and zucchini julienne.  The braised beef was excellent, very flavorful and tender, and the creamy polenta was the perfect compliment with plenty of flavor itself.  Polenta can often be very plain but this certainly was not.  The sea scallops were done perfectly, I find that scallops are often done one of two ways, excellent or very poorly.  These were done perfectly, my only complaint was the potatoes seemed to be a little dry, but wouldn't keep me from ordering the dish again.  The Sweetbread Fritto Misto was a very nice dish.  Its definitely a different twist on sweetbreads than what I've had in the past.  Often sweetbreads are served with some sort of heavier sauce.  These were slightly breaded and I believe sauteed, and it made the dish much lighter with the julienne vegetables.  A nice touch was very thinly sliced lemon pieces that were roasted as well giving a nice lemon flavor and additional crunch to the dish.  The dessert I had was the ricotta cheese cake which was a nice finish to the meal, it was slightly lighter and sweeter than a normal cheesecake, I'd order again.

We tried two bottles of wine, one was a Chianti and the other was a Sangiovese. Both were very good, unfortunately, I'll have to update later with the names when I get back there since they are escaping me at this time.

Overall Chinato is a must try in Cleveland which is sure to become a hot spot.  Check it out and see how Zack is at it again."}
{"text":"We have dined here a few times and think this is one of Cleveland's best. This time we dined during Zack Bruell's very own Restaurant Week.  Everything was wonderful. The extra we purchased were Escargot and calamari. Both in nice butter and Zach's own olive oil.  So tender. The four of us ordered the same meal from the select menu: butternut arancini--lightly fried balls of squash and ricotta. Melted in our mouths!  Could have shared. Lots of food. Entree was Mahi Mahi with eggplant agrodolce in a citrus sauce. Heavenly. Dessert was a light Tiramisu and one slice of Pistachio cheesecake that we shared.  Our waiter, Anthony, was professional and knowledgable, also helping us with our wine choice. Went before a Cavs game. Had a relaxed meal and conversation over two hours in the packed dining room, including the lower dining room. The best for fine dining!"}
{"text":"Incredible food!!! I love that you can get half portion pasta dishes because sometimes a full is just too much. My boyfriend and I like to share a pizza and a half pasta and it's the perfect amount! If you like fish, I recon their swordfish. It is sooo flavorful and presented beautifully. Also, their bread is so good but (beware) once you start..you cannot stop! Great atmosphere, great food, and great service. I always enjoy my time at Chinato."}
{"text":"We went to Chinato for my mother-in-law's birthday. We were underwhelmed. 

To start, we had reservations for 6:30pm on a Saturday. Upon walking in, they went to seat us at a booth. We asked for a table instead. While the host and hostesses did honor our request, they acted as if it was quite an inconvenience. I must note that at this time there were plenty of empty tables. The hostess said she had to figure out where to seat us because they had a large party coming in later and she didn't want us to be rushed. 

As for the food, it's just not worth the price. I'm not the most adventurous eater, so the menu seemed somewhat limited for me. I started with a frise salad with radishes, tomatoes and balsamic drizzle. It definitely needed more balsamic drizzle. I wasn't a big fan of the frise. It was a bit too bitter for me. 

Next, I tried the beef braised in amarone with creamy polenta. The beef was good- flavorful and so tender it was falling apart. The creamy polenta was too runny. I could barely pick it up with my fork. I would have liked it to be a little thicker. It was more like a sauce. 

My husband got the swordfish. He said it was pretty tasteless.

We also got an order of gnocchi for the table. We'd heard it was \"to die for,\" but no one at the table agreed. It was good, but nothing to write home about. 

Dessert was definitely the best part of the meal. I had the ricotta cheesecake. It was yummy, although I would have like a bit more fruit or fruit sauce with it. My mother-in-law ordered a cappuccino, which was delivered cold. They replaced it when she asked. 

Overall, this place just isn't worth the price or the hype. The food wasn't bad by any means, but it didn't blow me away. The service, too, was just OK."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week...how I love you!  

I chose to go to Chinato for restaurant week because I hadn't eaten a full dinner there but I'd been hearing so much buzz, I just had to try it!  I was not disappointed - even at Restaurant week where some of the restaurants feel like they can lower their game and still keep people happy (not true...but it seems like a common excuse).  

I ordered the gnocci in a mushroom sauce, the pork piccata and the only desert option - the cheesecake.  I was very happy with all of my choices.  The gnocci was a sweet potato fluffy little ball that paired well with the miso-like mushroom sauce.  The pork was a bit salty (hard not to be with a handful of capers), but very flavorful, well cooked and it seemed like an ample size.  Lastly, the desert was citrusy, smooth and deliciously placed on top of a little sugar cookie.  

Overall I was very happy with my choices.  Some other people at the table chose the shrimp which though everyone claimed to be delicious, was a much smaller portion so they all finished in lighting speed next to us.  

I was extremely happy with my food, and I'll admit - from my previous Restaurant Week experiences, I've not always been (cough, cough...Lola).  Our services was great and I'm only docking them because I had to ask for water twice (I did say the pork was salty, didn't I?).  

Great restaurant!  I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of a pretentious Italian restaurant. It seems to attempt to be a gourmet approach to Italian, but I could barely find anything on the menu that interested me. It had none of the traditional Italian dishes. That would be OK if what they offer it was really interesting, but I didn't think it was.

Two slices of Italian bread were dry but came with good olive oil. I was not familiar with the Italian wines, but the waitress pointed me to a blend (Unos Solus) that was quite good for $11 a glass. 

I started with the Tuscan onion soup. It's an onion purée with a few thin slices of Parmesan and a 2 inch crouton. It was served in a small cup that was half full. The taste was good and it was served hot. I  would have liked a few more spoonfuls. I ordered the grilled octopus, but sent it back. The texture was soft and mushy and there was very little flavor. Waitress was very nice about taking it back and offered me another choice. I ordered the brick flattened chicken and what I got was about 3 ounces of breast with skin and a bone attached in a bowl with some broth a small amount of salad and some small roasted potatoes. There wasn't much flavor and not much to eat.

Other than the wine, the best thing about this restaurant was the waitress, who was friendly, attentive, and happy to please.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great service - great food, low noise level doesn't get any better than that when you are with a large group of friends"}
{"text":"The food was great! Went for luch and we got the Salumi board for an appetizer and I got the seafood spaghetti. They weren't stingy on the seafood and there was a lot of great flavor.

The only complaint that I had was that it ended up being a 1.5 hour lunch. They didn't start making our entrees until we finished the appetizer. We had to ask for the check as the food came as we had to get back to work."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service wass out of this world. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place so when we got in and sat down and saw all the wonderful menu options, I was ecstatic. After that however, things kind of fell flat unfortunately. 

They start you with bread and olive oil. Bread, nothing special, not a whole lotta flavor, but the olive oil was good. 
For an appetizer, we started with the cheese plate. I thought it odd that I could not pick my cheese, but the waiter just asked \"Is there any cheese you do not like?\" and I said no. All the cheeses he brought were decent, the best was the bleu. But, the cheese board did not come with ANYTHING besides cheese! I had to ask for some crostini to eat it with! No fruits, nuts, or spreads either! And, later, when I was leaving I realized they have a whole board of about 20 cheeses to choose from and I didn't get to even hear about my choices for the board! Boo.

Then I ordered the gnocchi. It was very rich and buttery, but that's kind of where it ended. No real depth of flavor. D ordered the risotto. It was not a great texture and the cheese and peppers were cold with the warm risotto, which was odd. I wouldn't order that again. The other two in our party also had very average meals - but I didn't try them myself so I will not comment on them. 

Service was also very slow and one person ordered wine with the meal and didn't get it until the last bite of his meal. What good is that?

For the price and the prestige of this place, I really thought it would be better. A bit disappointed. Sorry."}
{"text":"Went here one night last week for dinner on a business trip. The place was pretty busy, but we were greeted and seated promptly. 

The menu options were awesome, and I wish I could have tried more dishes. Chinato has a different take on Italian that I haven't had before. Wanting to be able to try an appetizer, entree, and dessert I didn't order from the most expensive dishes on the menu.  

$6 - For appetizer I had the Beef tongue with eggplant - this was probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. It was cooked perfectly and didn't have any remnants of the skin - paired with the eggplant it's just an awesome dish - do not be afraid to try it!  

$12 - For the entree I had the Eggplant Pizza (thin crust)... which was really good and the fresh basil they used had an incredible amount of flavor - the crust was baked perfectly not like the chewy stuff you get at CPK. 

$6 - For dessert I had - despite the subzero windchill - a Vanilla Gelatto with pineapple. It was honestly the perfect balance of creaminess and sweetness. It came with thinly sliced pineapples (seemed like they were candied). The fresh springs of mint, just put it over the top as an amazing dessert choice.

The hostesses were great, as was the waitress - although she could have refilled our drinks more often, but the guy giving out the bread just came out of nowhere and started dumping bread on our plates - he seemed upset or something - oh well, the food made up for it.

I would definitely go to Chinato again, there is still a lot more on their menu I'd like to try."}
{"text":"I've only been once, but I loved it! We went for happy hour. So, I got 2 Peronis. I also got the gnocchi off their happy hour menu. I about died when I tried the first bite.. DELICIOUS! And, to top off a great meal/happy hour - my check only came out to 16 dollars!! I will DEFINITELY be returning!"}
{"text":"I brought my father here for Father's Day and the chef customized his menu by early request! We didn't even have to order anything when we arrived because the chef handled it all!! Food is great if only better portion sizes!"}
{"text":"Three letters: Y. U. M.  If you like good food, great service, and a very cool atmosphere you must check out this restaurant!!  I have had dinner there several times, apps at the bar, and attended a party in the basement.   I have zero negative things to say about any of my visits which is very rare for me!!!  This is my first pick to  take anyone visiting Cleveland for dinner."}
{"text":"Chinato: It must serve Chinese food, right? 

Woops!  Chinato is an Italian restaurant and it is fantastic.  My colleagues and I had dinner outside in the open-air seating and had a delightful dinner.  It's a great place to go when you want to feel like you are having a fancier dinner but do not want to get dressed up. Service was excellent but the food was even better!  I ordered the ravioli with pork, veal, zucchini, and shiitake mushrooms.  They were absolutely superb!  The ravioli was fresh and there was a great balance between pasta and filling.

Next time, I will definitely sample one of the wines from Chinato's extensive wine list!  :-)"}
{"text":"Great Italian food menu! Love the atmosphere. It's a nice place for a date or even with a group of people. Appetizers are excellent. Portions are a good size. It is pricey though."}
{"text":"Chinato is a restaurant I strongly recommend. My favorite food is ravioli and at Chinato I had some of the best ravioli ever. Chinato is on Fourth street and it has a lot of restaurants right near the holiday-in express hotel. For people who aren't big pasta or ravioli fans I still recommend checking out the menu. If you check out the menu and find that you don't want anything there are plenty of restaurants on fourth street. The waiters and waitresses are friendly and Chinato has good service. I went there twice when I was in Cleveland and I recommend if you like it come back."}
