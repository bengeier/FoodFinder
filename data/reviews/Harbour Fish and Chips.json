{"text":"I use to eat here over 25 years ago! I'm amazed the shop still exist.
The current owner was surprised I ate there so long ago.
The pricing is similar to other fish and chips in the city. 

I do not believe she was expecting any business at 3pm on New Year's eve, but she fired up the deep fryer and cook up some really good halibut and fries.
And it's worth the 25 years wait! It's very tasty, and the fries are awesome.
Ok, it is a hole in the wall kind of place, but it's best not to look inside the kitchen, it is not the cleanest I am afraid.

{"text":"I usually order a second piece of fish, but there is no need here. The fish was large and delicious. Lots of fries. I have paid twice this for fish and chips that weren't close to as good as these. The lady running the store was polite and friendly. This is my new go to fish and chips spot."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out based upon the 4 star rating on Yelp and relatively close proximity to where I live.  The place doesn't look the cleanest or furniture was just very old and dates.  However, the service was fast and friendly.

I ordered the halibut and onion rings to go and it cost around $12.

Now for the food.  The Halibut was very fresh and tasty but it was really oily so I used paper towel to soak it up first.

The onion rings were once again super oily so I used paper towel to soak up the extra oil.  The onions they used were very fresh though.

As I'm not a fan of oily food I would have to give them a 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"I like this place where did the lady go who ran it for years? I haven't seen her lately...it is some other woman"}
{"text":"LOVE the poutine!!!!
Yes I know the place looks kinda sketchy but the food is great! The service isnt too bad either and the prices are decent.

Tip: small poutine is more than enough for one person."}
{"text":"Harbour Fish and Chips, located in the Peanut Plaza in North York, is a tiny little joint usually frequented by students from the nearby Vanier high school.  

It is mostly a take-out/delivery place, but there are a few chairs in the front.  I'm not sure if you're supposed to sit there and eat, but nobody's complained.  

The food is great, especially the halibut and fries.  I always get an order of breaded mushrooms too.  So yummy.  

There's usually one cute little lady at the front that takes your orders, and she's always been fast and friendly with me.  She speaks very quietly though, so you may need to listen closely!

If you're in North York and you're jonesing for some fish & chips, try it out!"}
{"text":"delicious. Big protions. Its a take out place but bf and I sat in there and had nice meal. Tartar source cost extra. Dont really recommend the clams. There were sand in ours. The poutine was one of the best I HAVE EVER HAD!"}
{"text":"Might come back for fish and chips, but for now, this rating is based solely on the poutine. 

It was a bit salty for my tastes and I'm not sure if you have a choice, but I would have preferred it on a plate. We got ours in a box, which stacked a lot of the fries on top of each other. Mixed with the gravy, most of it ended up being soggy. 

It's not a traditional poutine in that they use some shredded cheese as opposed to cheese curds. It was an average - pretty good, could be improved, but nothing that warrants a special visit here.

It's more of a takeout place because there are only two small tables very close together and it's kind of dirty/sticky because Harbour fits in with the general grungy and no-frills Peanut Plaza atmosphere.

Might come back to try the fish and chips so I can review the place for its specialty, but only if I'm in the area. Unlikely I'd made a special trip here."}
{"text":"Came fast decent priced .people didnt speak great English but we got the order  done. :-)  gravy a bit to salty but little goes a long way. 
Talapia  was good  .just ask for them to lightly batter then its great."}
{"text":"Fish n chips is a dish that I judge harshly more than others.  It is because it is my favourite combination of foods put together. The halibut and chips is definitely worth its value and the way the owner makes deep fries it on the spot makes it as fresh as possible. How much more fresh can it get? The only reason why I rate this place 3 stars is because the creativity of tartar sauce would hit it home. You are only given 2 packs of tartar sauce which is definitely not enough. In order to get more you would have to pay an extra cost. Overall, as a place to grab a filling quick bite to eat with only 10 bucks, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I had a hard time finding a good \"old style\" fish and chips joint outside of Parkdale Fish and Chips in Hamilton. But I finally found one! 
You get a lot of food for the price. The fish is tasty, flavourful (not fishy), not gross greasy...but definitely that good ol' oily batter.

Super crispy outside and light and fluffy inside, all I needed was a bit of lemon! 

If you want a cheap meal that's tasty, homemade feel and filling then head over (cash in hand)!"}
{"text":"First off, I'd like to say that before today, I'd never been to a Chinese-run fish and chips place. Now I have. What's amazing is that they've been, according to the lady in charge, running this place for over 30 years!

Prices are really good. Daily special was 1 piece of fish (large piece. today was cod), fries (she switched them to onion rings for me) and gravy for $4.99! Fantastic portions. 

Had:

3x daily special: Two with onion rings, one with fries (fresh cut). Fish made to order! Fish was crispy even after a 20 minute drive up to Richmond Hill in -15+ weather. Tartar sauce comes out of a packet, but I'm not complaining. Gravy was decent. Only one small container of gravy for the three specials though (perhaps cuz only one came with fries). Onion rings were battered, not breaded. Slightly overcooked, but batter was crispy, more tempura batter than beer batter. Suggestion about the fish: if it's cold, heat it up before eating it. Otherwise, you get an icky starching coating on your mouth.

1x clam strips:  At $3.20(?), it was a really good portion. For the first time ever, I could actually taste and feel the clam in my clam strips. It wasn't all batter! These are from frozen though. A tad crunchier than the fish. 

1x breaded mushrooms: This was $2.99 for 10, but she gave us 13 mushrooms! They're not breaded. They're battered similarly to the onion rings. These were my favorite item of the night. Mmmmm. Mushrooms. Totally worth it. I'll come back for these even if I opt out of the fish and the chips.

Total damage after tax: $25.85.

Saw: Poutine. Shredded cheese, not curds. Lots of gravy. Lots of fries. Big portion. Small price for portion. Seems like a student favorite (when watching people order/eat).

Service: Surprisingly good service. Lady in charge was super friendly. Was willing to accommodate substitutions. Said goodbye when we left. Also wished us a good night. Seems to have a good relationship with the regulars.

FYI's: Halibut has gone up about $0.70 (not yet changed on the menu). Totally different train of thought. They have two or three tables which seat two people. Primarily take out, this place. Derailing again. They put their food in cardboard takeout boxes, then wrap them in paper. Not newspaper, but paper nonetheless. They then put these into paper bags. Hurray for being eco-friendly! =D"}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall joint. But was fast and tasty. Price is very fair and quality of food is decent for that price. Fish was moist and fries were okay. Gravy really makes up for it. Was my first time here but will definitely come back. Great price and good food."}
{"text":"I was passing buy.I seen fish chips place.close my house.I  said all check see how it is.
There friendly and helpful.The fish oh ok but Little and
Greece and fries where lot but it wasn't best fries,
I had.Had better fish before am knot sure may be I try them one more I give places 3 chance s see you are there good or knot."}
{"text":"It's a \"whole in the wall\" take out shop but don't let that fool you.  This is a quality fish and chip place that gives you a great meal.  The fish is always properly cooked.  You'll get a portion of chips as big as your head.  Okay, maybe a bit smaller but enough for two.  I've lived in Toronto all my life and this place is certainly one of the best.  Just keep in mind that there is no real place to eat your food.  Take it home and enjoy."}
{"text":"The food here is really good for its price. I love the taste of the gravy here so the lunch special poutine is definitely worth its price. They also do take outs here"}
{"text":"Great fish, great chips, for a great price! Everything is freshly fried and breaded when you order. Get the daily special for $4.99."}
{"text":"One of my weekly trips here to get my Halibut and chips.  Small little joint but love the attention I get everytime I go in.

They have a bunch of lunch specials on the front window but I go for the tried and true Fish and Chips with plenty of good malted vinegar with a ice cold coke...

When I was eating I was watching her get a fresh hallibut out and start cutting into the steaks, cannot be any fresher than that!  Did I mention they have freshly cut french fries (gravy and poutine option are available)"}
{"text":"Okay, I am conflicted here.  Yes, the haddock fish fillets were HUGE.  One slice went a long way.  Everything was well fried, hot, crunch and delicious.  The fries and onion rings were well-portioned.  The pricing was cheaper than many places.  What is the conflict?  It is that the food is way oilier than most places I have been to.  I had heart burn afterwards.  My best suggestion is to not over order.  An one-piece fish & fries combo can really fill you up.

Overall, food 3 stars.  Overall value, 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I tried the halibut fish and chips and it was ok.. a lil too oily.  The price was slightly cheaper than most.  Still, I'd stick with going to My Place Fish and Chips.  Also, this place looks kinda sketchy."}
