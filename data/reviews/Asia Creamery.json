{"text":"Great spot for creamy, yummy and fresh ice cream! Workers are very nice and patient! I got the quezo ice cream and it was creamy and not too sweet.  My boyfriend got the blueberry cheesecake ice cream and said it was very good. They have a great assortment of asian flavors and The portions are very generous! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Asia Creamery is by far one of the best ice cream shops we've been to. I had the ube ice cream which was to die for. My husband had the lychee which he said was just like eating a fresh lychee from the shell. He liked it so much, he went back in and had the mango ice cream. Needless to say, it was just as awesome.  The service was great too. They let us try a lot of different flavors before settling on the ones we had. If the ice cream tastes this great in the winter, just imagine how much more in the summer. We will return."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place a higher rating, but I just can't. The ice cream place is cute and the staff was really friendly, but the ice cream was bleh... They probably had maybe a dozen or less flavors and we sampled a good amount of them but none of them tasted remotely to their name. I decided to just order a soft serve mixture, half chocolate half vanilla, but something with the machine was broken or it was off and I needed to wait while they resolved it. I waited patiently for about 10 mins, when they finally just handed me a whole serving of chocolate soft serve and a whole serving of vanilla soft serve. It was nice of them to give me the extra ice cream, but it was seriously a mountain of ice cream that I felt terrible having to waste because I couldn't finish it.  I wish they had just told me they were unable to give me the mixture then I would have just picked one flavor."}
{"text":"First day I came here I was hooked so many ice cream flavors. Good thing they let you sample too. They had flavors I didn't know possible like avocado, and queso. Also there Taro taste so good they make all there ice cream right there more of a natural flavor and they make cakes too. I had to come back to get the cake which was a big hit at the party everyone loved the taro cake. Also first time trying the halo halo and will be back for more!!!! By the was the lady there has very good costumer service very friendly and had good recommendations!!!"}
{"text":"Went here to satisfy our ice cream craving, and had regrets why we didn't try it sooner. I'm impressed! Their ice creams are home made in their shop and they use real fruits, not fruit flavors or powders and stuff...I had the Ube Macapuno ice cream--and it was the bomb! My fiancé tried the Cheese flavor (which I didn't expect) and he got hooked! They also make ice cream cakes, boba drinks, and the famous Filipino dessert Halo-halo. I met one of the owners, Leonardo, and one of the staff, Marilou--and they are so sweet and accommodating! This is the place to go folks!"}
{"text":"Tried this after my friend showed me and I love the Ube the most (: You can also sample any flavor and they have a lot of flavors you wouldn't see in a normal ice cream shop"}
{"text":"Nice little find; a little store tucked in a corner of a shopping center. Once you find it, you will definitely come back. Unique Hawaiian inspired flavors. Owned by locals and made fresh every day. Very friendly service; they will be happy to have you try anything you want. You cannot go wrong; every flavor is delicious and rich, with also custom cakes and ice cream sandwiches. Try it, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Their soft serves are SO CREAMY and delicious! The best I've had. They have multiple flavors of soft serve to choose from. They have drinks, soft serves, ice cream, ice cream, and more. The flavors of their ice cream have unique American and Asian flavors so there's always something new to try. The owners are incredibly friendly too."}
{"text":"Asia Creamery is a small ice cream shop where you can binge on typical Asian ice cream flavors. There's lychee, jackfruit, cheese (yes, cheese!), etc.   But what we always go for is their Ube Soft Serve! It's creamy, milky, sweet and so good especially on a hot summer day. But honestly, I'd probably still be here during winter, lol.   Come by during Tuesday or Thursday to get certain items BOGO! Such a good deal! They have Asian flavor ice cream cakes too, which I can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"I love the owners here, looks like a family owned spot. Service is amazing and they are always so sweet to my kids. They have delicious Asian flavors like ube macapuno, green tea, lychee, melon, and jackfruit. They also make halo halo here with your choice of ice cream on top. Hubby likes being able to grab a halo halo right across the street from our house. They never seem busy so I really hope business picks up and they're able to stay around. They are a bit of a hidden gem between LOL Kids Club and Goodwill. Go check them out and grab a scoop!!"}
{"text":"First time here... i had to try the Halo Halo of course I'm Filipino it's our fave..oh it's 5.99 btw"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Service is always friendly ! Ice creams are light and flavorful & made in house. They even make Halo halo !!  Prices are more than reasonable ! Go support this family owned business ya'll !"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! Cute shop with vibrant colors and friendly staff! Ice cream (banana nut crunch, nutella, ube, halo-halo) was SUPER FANTASTIC! You can ask for as many samples as you want without anyone giving attitude..that's a plus!! I loved the soft serve too! SO TASTY! You can really tell they put a lot of work into their homemade ice cream because the flavors really blended well with others. I can't wait to try the shakes & malts on my next visit. I noticed TO GO ice cream cakes for sale and individual 'packaged' ice cream in freezers there too. I can already tell this will be my place TO BE this entire Spring & Summer lol. PS: VERY Reasonably Priced as well."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend for ice cream, and I love their flavors!  Staff is super friendly and helpful.  If you love Filipino flavors, this is definitely for you!"}
{"text":"Came here after an impromptu lunch with my husband. I've been reading the reviews about the ube soft serve and it got me really curious about it. The ube soft serve did not disappoint, husband had the langka soft serve which was equally good too. Met the nice owner, Leo. My husband had a good chat with him. The lady (I will come back to get your name to post it here) by the counter was so nice and very informative on the flavors they carry. Highly recommend to everyone! Let's support family owned businesses like Asia Creamy. We'll be back ---Al and May  Just returned to this place to order an ice cream cake for my daughter's kindergarten promotion get-together. My daughter picked the birthday cake and ube flavor...she was so happy. Thanks Marilou for the awesome customer service...as always and now i remember yoor name! Will post pic of the cake when i pick it up."}
{"text":"Awesome selection  Halo halo and ube ice cream!!!!  Great customer service  We'll be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Decent place! Great flavors like ube and cheese ice cream. Variety may be lacking a bit. Employees are very friendly and prices are reasonable.  I wish they had more drink options and more seats. Its a very tight fit in there."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. Cute small ice cream business with very kind employees. They also have ice cream cake, they offer boba & halo halo! Definitely try this place out and support them!! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"When i want Filipino ice cream, this is the place. I came here by a friends recommendation. I liked they had the exotic fruit flavored ice creams (away from the 'merican norm).  Buko pandan and Jackfruit are the best flavors (not all will agree with me).  Friendly staff and good ice cream ya can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Recht gute Auswahl jedoch geschmacklich eher keine große Überraschung. Hier spricht zwar nichts gegen einen Besuch besonders wenn man gerade in der nähe ist, jedoch würde ich hier nicht extra hinfahren."}
{"text":"Say it with me: Ube Soft Serve. Holy.... you must try it.   Asia Creamery is tucked away in a mini mall behind a mini mall. I have lived in the area for a few years and I just discovered this place. Perfect dessert spot for lovers of Filipino/asian flavors."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their halo halo.  It was very icey and had more liquid than stuff.  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"After grabbing a quick lunch on a hot day, I walked past this gem and figured why not. I am so glad that I stopped in. Not only was this spot super friendly, but this ice cream was very fresh. You can taste that someone is making this in house and are taking their time with getting it just so. I went with the ube and bought a quart of the pumpkin and cinnamon to go for my boyfriend. I don't even like pumpkin stuff, and that was fantastic!  Very impressed. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good Halo Halo! Loved the Ube macapuno ice cream, coffee, cookies and cream, birthday cake & cookie dough ice cream."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the buko pandan with boba plus the 13 other flavors i tested the friendly crew didn't made me feel intimidated at all when i couldn't decide what to have, so I'll say very good with 5 stars"}
{"text":"My kids enjoyed the Ice cream and customer service is great but I was really disappointed in the halo halo taste very bland and the crunch that was put in it was gross was an epic fail the best places to go for halo halo is julibee and chowking"}
{"text":"I've only had 2 flavors so far so I can't give this place 5 stars yet, but I'll be going back to try more soon :) There are a lot of very unique flavors here that I have never seen before, but you are allowed to sample as many as you want, to see if you like them. Awesome customer service. My server was extremely friendly and knowledgable about all the flavors. I had a small cone with a scoop of Jack Fruit and a scoop of Halo Halo. I liked the Halo Halo, it was fruity and not too sweet. I LOVED the Jack Fruit. It has a bright, citrusy flavor that's kind of like a cross between a mango and a pineapple. It was fantastic. Can't wait to try the rest of the incredibly unique flavors!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. All flavors are great. Great staffs and clean. Filipino favorites are a must. Asia creamery wont disappoint you."}
{"text":"Bomb ass ice cream! Coming back to try every flavor in shake form! Nice customer service! Seems like a family business...which is nice!!"}
{"text":"My family loves coming here.  Joseph was there during our first time there, and he made us feel really at home. My little one is not really into ice cream, but ever since she had their homemade flavors, she now looks forward to having \"purple icecream\" (ube). Joseph is very sweet and always smiling. He is always so nice and pleasant to my family and all visitors. His energy is really genuine. Marilou is also very sweet and pleasant. She always has a smile on her face, as well. This is the dessert shop to come to where everything tastes amazing and where everyone is happy to help you. My husband loves their halo halo. We love both their ube by the scoop and soft serve ube. We also love their buco pandan flavor. They also make homemade ice cream cakes that we recently tried out. This place is a sweet little gem. We'll be coming here forever"}
{"text":"Value: Worth it for the price!  Serving size was really good.  Highlight: Our favorite was the lychee and we also really like the soft serve ice cream!  Service was also a plus + It was an over all four star experience for us, a great place to bring your kid to just stop by and go. Are we going back? yes."}
{"text":"If you're looking for ice cream with traditional Filipino flavors, this is the spot. They have flavors such Ube, bukopandan, cheese, and jackfruit. You can order scoops in a cup, waffle cone, or even ice cream cake! Service was very traditional filipino style with friendly faces calling you \"sir\" and \"maam\". Only thing that was a turn off was the weird smell when first entering. I'm not sure what it is, or maybe it was just that day, but something smelled a little off. Other then that, great Phillippines inspried ice cream shop."}
{"text":"Omg! Tropical flavors without much guilt! I encourage for you to sample the flavors. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Valerie Ian Murillo is the best server Ever people, she will give you as many samples as you like with very great customer service!!  Asia Creamery is Very Delicious !! #"}
{"text":"I like halo halo.friendly staffs. They only have small tables for 2. We have to split table . Nice & clean place."}
{"text":"We were greeted by pleasant faces! Loving their smiles and gave us the option of tasting when we were in. They have the best flavors! Glad that they are close to our home. I tried their jackfruit ice cream and it was DELICIOUS!! Halo2 was yummy too as per my Sis. Thanks and we will be back again. Very cozy place."}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back. Sampled so many different flavors. Loved them all which made it difficult to make a decision. We got ube and melon ice cream in a cup. And halo halo. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place after going to LOL Kids Club. So good! They have Ube soft serve and ice cream, Halo Halo, and many more. Ice cream sandwiches, and ice cream cakes too! Bought ice cream for the whole family for $15 total. Definitely will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and many choices to pick from! Definitely satisfied my cravings. I had the banana crunch and chocolate marshmallow nut ice cream! Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Haven't written a review since last year-- been way too busy... but I felt like this place needed my review! My little family and I have been to Asia Creamery a handful of times i can't even recall the number of times we've been. Every single time the staff has always been so accommodating! I believe the owner is a Filipino man and he always greets us with a smile and asks us if we want to sample anything. It's always a pleasure walking into a business who truly take pride in their customer service.   Aside from that... if I'm craving any flavors from home (Philippines) or even dessert... this place is my go-to! I highly suggest the blueberry cheesecake ice cream, taro, or even the queso! All of them are my favorites.. I can't choose just one! My boyfriend is always so indecisive when we come because he wants *everything*. Everything here is so tasty and not overly sweet.   Take a chance on this little hidden gem. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent! They have a really good variety and it's well worth stopping in.  Place is a little small,  but it's nice and cool inside.  Very clean and tidy.  They make really good use of the space.  Can't go wrong with Ube soft serve! Now if they could only do Ube donuts and Ube I've cream...they'd be set."}
{"text":"A decent ice cream place that offers Asian flavors. Awesome service. They offered me to try any flavors I want, while being super nice about it. I didn't feel hurried along, while trying to decide what I wanted to get. I like their ube, pandan, and jackfruit ice cream. Their lychee and avocado were just ok. Didn't like their green tea flavor, as it had a strange taste. Their ube soft serve is also good. The coffee soft serve was so so. The coffee flavor was not strong enough. They have BOGO on soft serve and shakes on Tuesday and Thursday. Any of the ice cream flavors can be made into shakes. They also sell ice cream cakes. Pricing is very reasonable.  Small soft serve is $3. Single flavor small ice cream is $3.50. I love supporting small local places, so I'm looking forward to going back and trying their halo halo!"}
{"text":"Delicious soft serve and it's buy 1 get 1 free on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The ice cream cakes look really good. Definitely trying 1 of those next time."}
{"text":"This place is very MEH. The boba is almost good but the drink flavors are off. They taste very artificial and just bad to me.  Oh and I've never been to a boba place that had such cheap cups and straws that made it difficult to even drink. Definitely need to get better cups and straws!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Hawaii and have been having thee worse sweet tooth cravings ever. I really wanted a good chocolate chip cookie that wasn't store bought but couldn't find anywhere near Enterprise so I had to settle for ice cream. Even though it's 48 degrees out, I can never stray away from a good cup of creamy delectable ice cream. We went to another ice cream business last night, so we decided to give Asia Creamery a try.   We had no problem finding the place and parking was of course plentiful. When you get to the store, your greeted by lots and lots of signs of what they offer. House made ice creams, premade ice cream cakes, single premade ice cream cones/sandwiches , and even 6 piece packs for you to take home for the family. Besides your regular degular ice creams, they also serve house made soft serve, boba drinks, and (almost) every Filipinos faveee infamous dessert, Halo Halo. What more could you possibly ask for in a ice cream joint right? OH and not to mention they also sell bottled water for 99¢ which is the cheapest I've seen thus far at any other eatery up here lol.    Once we entered we were immediately greeted by the friendly staff who then proceeded to offer us to do some tastings. Samples? YES PLEASE! I'm a chocolate all around type of girl so I had to try their chocolate fudge brownie ice cream first and that was definitely yummy. My boyfriend sampled the coffee chip? I can't remember what it was called, but I also LOVE coffee anything, and like an idiot without tasting it first, I instantly asked for a scoop of that thinking I'd like it. Sadly I did not. The coffee flavor was very minimal and I feel like it could use a lot more pizazz to it. Even the chocolate pieces in there didn't taste really chocolately. It also had that fake waxy texture to it which is not good. My other half got the Oreo cookie sandwich smooshed together with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and that was delicious! I was able to sneak a bite when he wasn't looking for a moment lol!   Even though the flavor I got was not to my liking, I wouldn't mind at all coming back here since their other stuff seemed pretty tasty and customer service skills were on point. Just be sure to sample before setting your mind on what flavor. Happy Holidays!"}
{"text":"All the flavors are great! Soft serve shakes (Ube, Coffee, Pistachio) great place.they also have cakes which looks good as well."}
{"text":"Totally worth the drive from Inspirada!! Not only did I sample, but the owner, very proud of his creations, pushed more on me which was awesome. I went with ube Macapuno and the pandan. Maybe it is because of my living in the bay area, but I don't think they charge enough. Anyone whining about the pricing or flavors obviously does not know quality."}
{"text":"I had their Halo Halo and my friends had Melon and Buko ice cream. They were all very good. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place kinda brings you back to the Philippines, with all the different flavors of ice cream that they have available (Cheese, Avocado, Melon, Mango, Lychee, and so many more!) The ice cream was creamy and tasteful! I can't wait to come back and try their halo-halo and ice cream cake!!"}
{"text":"Omg their ube soft serve was so yummy! I must've tasted all their flavors but the ube macapuno was definitely my fave!  I took 1 star off cuz I ordered boba for my daughter and husband.  Both said the drink was hella good but the boba had a weird texture not like the regular soft chewy boba.  I didnt taste it myself but they probably won't be getting their drinks with boba again.  Other than that the staff that were there were so nice and accommodating.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has good icecream and perhaps even better, icecream sandwhiches and cakes you can fill with any combination of the flavors available. Ube, buko pandan and cheesy queso  (misleading in name, tastes like ube w a bit of salt). We came during lunch and the service was fast and friendly. Compared to Creamberry down the street I find Asia Creamery's icecream jusy not as good by comparison. Creamberry is a milky full bodied cream in all of their flavors, rhey offer rolled ocecream, fresh made waffles and she's, honey toast and a wide variety of Filipino flavors like ube, matcha, Bukuo pandan and Thai tea (albeit not a cheesy queso like Asia Creamery). But Asia Creamery's icecream isn't as substantional almost watered down a bit by comparison, like a store bought icecream. Also when we went they had advertised a limited selection of shakes buy one get one and yet both were rung at full price. Also I find this parking lot/location by the Goodwill hard to get in and out of due to traffic. However I don't know of anywhere else you go go get a 6 pack of ube icecream sandwhiches or a full one UBE icecream cake!"}
{"text":"When I stopped in tonight I was pleasantly surprised! The shop is small and their flavors are a little more limited than other nearby asian-inspired ice cream places, but their prices are good and so is the ice cream!  I tried the Ube flavors (the soft serve is my favorite) as well as the jackfruit. Both were delicious - although I love sugar, so I like my ice cream super sweet! They gave us a coupon for buy one get one free soft serve on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which is a great deal.   The girl working behind the counter was friendly and helpful. She gave us quite a few samples without any judgement; she seemed to genuinely be interested in us finding our favorite flavors before we ordered. The customer service here was very good!"}
{"text":"After a dinner of noodles, I opted to forego dessert and look for something different.  Yelp reviews led me to Asia Creamery.  I looked at the menu board and was ready to order some ice cream when I saw the sign that they now had halo-halo.  That's what I ordered and it comes topped with a scoop of ice cream of the flavor you choose.  I went with ube.  I am not particularly a fan of shaved ice desserts but there's something about the sweetness of the evaporated milk with the ice that makes this taste better to me.  The ice cream was good.  The dessert is a bit hard to eat without getting sticky hands but there is a restroom where I washed my hands before I left.  Very pleasant service."}
{"text":"Best ice cream store in Vegas with Asian inspired tropical flavors that are all made in house. Love the custom ice cream cakes!"}
{"text":"Cute little shop. However, the ice cream lacked flavor. I was excited to try out the avocado flavored ice cream, but it didn't quite scream avocado. We opted for the ube and it also lacked flavor."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The people here are so lovable!  I was craving for halo halo and yelped and found this hidden gem. For my Wazer user, Waze may take you to a wrong location/direction - check yelp/google map. I initially used Waze and it took me to the wrong plaza before I finally found this place. Hooray!   When I arrived, I came in knowing what I wanted and told the front staff - halo halo, it is. While another staff made the halo halo, the front staff was so sweet and generous that she offered samples to try their unique filipino ice cream flavors. It was my childhood dream come true - yummy and free ice cream O.M.G. Among the flavors I tried, my favorites were \"creamy queso\" aka cheese (it was interesting flavor - I like their creativity to make an ice cream flavor out of it), ube and buko pandan.   The halo halo was good - probably one of the better ones I have had in the U.S. since my visit in the Philippines. I like the flakes on top and the variety of toppings they add - like langka, leche flan and sago."}
{"text":"A cute gem of a place! The shakes are made fresh from ice cream. I tried the Melon boba and it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I loved it!   I got the avocado and ube ice cream. I've never had avocado ice cream before so I was a little skeptic when I seen the flavor, but I noticed how common it was on their yelp reviews so I asked for a sample and it was delicious  the ube ice cream was great! My 2yr old daughter really enjoyed it too. I didn't catch the girl's name that assisted me and my family, she was nice, very quick in offering samples. There is a lot of flavors to choose from and I will definitely plan on making a trip back to try more. If you haven't been in yet, I recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"One, if not the best, ice cream place in Las Vegas. Must try the halo halo. Super good!"}
{"text":"Ok found a real good ice cream place. And best of all they had a special for $1.00 scoops!   The ice cream is freshly made and is really good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Birthday cake is my favourite flavour from them. They have really good special deals. My ice cream obsession is back because of them haha."}
{"text":"This is the closest you'll get to authentic asian ice cream (specifically filipino!!). The queso ice cream reminds me of the classic \"dirty ice cream\" cart in the philippines. Love coming here. plus the staff is just so friendly. You get to sample and try flavors too! We got the queso & melon, queso & green tea, and strawberry & passion fruit!! all so yummy!"}
{"text":"Omg. The banana nut crunch was great. Taste just  like banana pudding. Great varieties from classics to their own original creations. I will be back again.."}
{"text":"I bring my kids here every week and I love their Asian flavors. This is a Filipino owned shop and the owner and workers are always very friendly. My kids say they love all the flavors here. My favorites are the queso and pandan. My kids like coconut, cotton candy and many other flavors. They have ice cream cakes and soft serve and Halo-Halo.  If you shop at the Albertsons next door and keep your receipt....on the back is a buy one get one offer. It doesn't get better than that!"}
{"text":"I loved this little Asian ice cream shop! The people were very friendly & I loved how many different flavors they had; ube, passion fruit, buku pandan, kiwi, etc. They also have Halo Halo, which is hard to find. The prices here were great & the quality is as well!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I thought I was in love with the coconut lemongrass ice-cream I tried, until I got a taste of the ube soft serve. Wholly cow, we will be back to order their cakes and try some of their homemade ice-cream sandwiches...oh, and don't hold me to this, but I believe they do two for the price of one on soft serve every Thursday. Supposedly, they also do boba as well...no doubt, we'll be back to check out new flavors and products. We've been to tons of ice-cream places in town...this is one of the best and most unique. Only downer for me was their lack of coffee products. But you can't expect every business to cater to every want out there. Especially, when they do what they do so well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise! We just happened to make a wrong turn...noticed Asia Creamery with a Halo-halo picture on the window. Ordered the Halo-halo and it was sooooo gooood! It had so many delicious ingredients in the cup. Not overly sweet, and it makes you wanting more.  Recommend this place to everyone! The owners are really friendly too"}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream and lovely people! They offer soft serve, homemade ice cream and shakes. Would recommend the homemade ice cream, they have such unique flavors (especially Filipino flavors-the halo halo is super good!!) They also sell novelties such as cakes, ice cream sandwiches, and premade cones if you're on the go."}
{"text":"Ok I love ice cream. So I dont typically review ice cream shops as its very hard for one to disappoint me. I especially love the shops that make the ice cream in house. This one is fantastic! The pineapple ice is soooooooo good and it immediately made me think of disneyland dole whip. So yes it was good. Also had the ube soft serve which was. First for me. Super creamy. If you're i  Vegas stop by here. So worth it"}
{"text":"Amazing Ice Cream!!!  Cheap Prices!!!  Unique (and traditional) Flavors!!!  Amazing Ice Cream!!!  Cheap Prices!!!  Unique (and traditional) Flavors!!!"}
{"text":"Ube? I'm there! I love the variety of Asian ice cream flavors here. What I ended up loving was their Halo Halo, which is a Filipino dessert that means \"mix mix.\"  It has different jellies, beans, flan, pinipig (toasted rice), purple yam jam, ice, evaporated milk, and of course delicious ube macapuno ice cream on top.  You can pick whichever ice cream you want on top, if you don't want ube. It's beautiful with distinct layers, but to eat it mix it all up first.   I sampled the ube soft serve and it was super creamy!  The worker was nice enough to let me sample some other ice cream flavors too like pandan, queso, and melon.  They also have traditional flavors too. They have shakes, ice cream cookie sandwiches, and cakes. There is limited seating inside, but there is is some outside too. The location is a bit hidden from street view, but it is right next to lol kids club (look for the panda!)."}
{"text":"Great ice cream with lots of exotic flavors.  A real lifesaver in the summer heat.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ice milk style ice cream.  Very poor quality, for the high prices.  Service was good and friendly.  Place was clean...  Smart location if they would change thier product."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The service here is amazing and unparalleled! The flavors are fresh and the owner and his niece working were genuinely amazing. Walking in was greeted with a warm welcome and samples. They have a yelp check in of 10% off and a BOGO on tuesdays!! 4 scoops of ice cream for 5.75 definitely worth it fed 2 people easily. It's a refreshing family owned business and I highly recommend to anybody looking for a cold refreshing treat!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with my cousin for the first time and the place is awesome! Ordered halo halo and I loved it. Prices are great and the service was awesome. I recommend anyone that wants to go there for some good boba, ice cream or halo halo. They have cakes too!"}
{"text":"Part of the ever-sprawling section of Rainbow Boulevard South of the 215 it was in search of dessert that a stop was made at Asia Creamery, its location tucked away in a Strip Mall between yet another Poke Bowl Restaurant and an enormous Family Fun Center likely beneficial in terms of foot traffic but not exactly helping the locally owned and operated Scoop Shop in terms of visibility for those not actively searching for it.  Officially opened in the waning days of 2016 and fancied by what appears to be a largely Pilipino population drawn in by Hard and Soft Serve flavors including the likes of Ube, Jack Fruit, Coconut and others, it was with a group of three folks purchasing gift cards for friends that the menu was perused while a young staff member stood ready in wait ready to offer both samples and recommendations.  Stating that \"everything in the case\" is made on-site in reference to over a dozen brightly colored bins, the Jack Fruit a bit icy but four other flavors all smooth including bitter-sweet Coffee Chip, it was without much hesitation that one Ice Cream Sandwich and a cup of Halo-Halo was selected, a total of $10 paid including tax and tip.  Given the choice of Oreo or Chocolate Wafer to contain the Sandwich, a difference that is seemingly just a matter of branding, it was between layers of the former that a ball of \"Creamy Queso\" was gently squashed, the flavor not so different from the sort found in the Frosting atop Red Velvet Cake and overall quite pleasant without being too sweet.  Working on the Sandwich as part two of the order was concocted behind the counter, an Ice shaver actively whirring instead of the typical blender, it was largely as a result of this instrument that Asia Creamery's Halo-Halo came across smoother and more enjoyable than others compromised by the heterogeneity of uncracked Ice Cubes, a scoop of Ube Ice Cream with strips of Coconut mixed in after sipping the over-stuffed cup down and each bite thereafter a little different and particularly good when including candied Cherries or Flan.  FOUR STARS:  Not quite as pure a product as Rainbow Boulevard's two Gelato Shops there is nonetheless a lot to like about Asia Creamery both in terms of its novel housemade flavors and pleasant customer service."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place! And I was not disappointed. The service was great and the flavors were amazing. I got the ube soft serve and it was so tasty. I cannot wait to go back and try their halo halo. I think I've found my new favorite spot to satisfy my sweet cravings."}
{"text":"Pretty good ice cream, friendly customer service, nice space and has outdoor seating.  I like:  - Creamy Queso - Buko Pandan - Ube"}
{"text":"Another new place in the SW searching goodies  Came here last night with family and again right now.   Ice cream is good, prices are good and portion size is good.   They have Filipino ice cream cakes!!! YAY!  Customer service is on point!"}
{"text":"Delicious way to start this sunny day. I am new to town So they were very nice to let me try a couple of flavors before getting the one I wanted.I got the Ube smoothie with pearls, very yummy. This place has many varieties of ice cream, cakes, and cookies ice cream! . I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"If you want interesting and tasty ice cream flavors, you must come here!   They were super nice and allowed us to sample a good amount of flavors. I ended up getting half ube and half pandan! Soooo good!  What's nice about the flavors is you can choose something you've never had before, like ube. Or, if you want something familiar, but different, like thier banana crunch!  It's good for anyone looking to change things up!"}
{"text":"The ube soft serve is amazing! Great selection of tropical flavors. Friendly staff, always asking if we wanted to sample any of the flavors. We bought an ice cream cake. Since we live about 30 min away, they wrapped it up for us and placed it in an insulated bag. Great establishment"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this shop for a while now and finally found someone to go/take me there. Living on uber/lyft for 3 weeks sucks a huge chunk of my food expenses.   So they promote the buy 1 get 1 free on Thursday but it's only for their soft serve! Don't be fooled like me!   I sample so many flavors but none of them stood out to me. My go to coffee flavor, as well as the lychee, was extremely dilute. I never had such bland coffee and lychee flavored ice cream before. The avocado and queso flavors were strange and the jack fruit flavor was too sweet. I eventually settled with the ube and banana crunch because I felt obligated to purchase something. I was far from satisfied with the ice cream.   Great customer service. They don't judge you for sampling a lot."}
{"text":"Bought some ready made ice cream Oreo cookie sandwiches. They were delicious. You can also get them made to order with your choice of ice cream. Service was above and beyond. You can sample their wide variety of flavors and find a new favorite. It's a local business worth supporting. Give it a chance you might find a great sweet treat!"}
{"text":"Great service, best frozen desserts!!! I love all the Filipino flavors especially Ube-macapuno,  halo-halo, coconut and avocado.  Their shakes with boba is worth this Las Vegas trip. They even turned my favorite flavor into cake with my picture on it. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I came across this new dessert place while searching on Yelp!  We walked in and the employees were so nice. They offered us samples of everything, both ice cream and soft serve!  The soft serve is my favorite!  I am a Soft serve freak and this has got to be the best I've had outside of Disneyland California Park. They only 4 flavors but they're all great. You can't beat Thursdays either. The deal of buy one soft serve and get one free!  EVEN if you don't have that extra plus one they give you one to take home!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! It's sooo cheap and they have a unique flavors that you can't get elsewhere. You can get a small cup with 2 scoops of ice cream for like $3. The pandan and ube ice cream are the best!!!! Will definitely be coming back here very soon!"}
{"text":"This is place is a hidden gem. The owner and the staff were extremely helpful on recommending amazing combinations of ice creams."}
{"text":"decided to stop by this place the other day to check it out and did not regret it! this is going to be the new ice cream spot. they make fresh ice cream and it's BOMB. i don't usually take time to review dessert/ice cream spots but this is hands down the best ice cream i have ever had, no exaggeration. they say it's made fresh and trust me, you can tell. they have a pretty wide variety of regular ice cream flavors and different soft serve flavors as well. i had avocado and birthday cake on a cone, it was fantastic! next time i want to try the ube soft serve. good service too. my mom just ordered a cake from here and i can't wait to try it. i am just glad this is a few blocks from my house. definitely a 5 star spot in my book!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. How can you go wrong with childhood favorites? Ice cream flavors I grew up with like ube, queso, avocado, buko pandan, banana..... they even have halo halo with toppings like lanka, flan and ube.   They were super accommodating with me and topped my 3 scoops with toppings reserved for halo halo.   I ordered a scoop each of ube, queso and avocado topped with ube and lanka. I was so excited when I took it to the table, took my first bite and.......  Sadness  no other words to describe it but sadness.....   The flavors are very weak and diluted. Not strong and pronounced. Not sure if they are downplaying the flavors to cater to a more diverse population but it's just not working for. Their ice creams all had a milky mellow flavor which may work for some people. Just not what I was looking for. Indistinguishable flavors. Even the ube topping did not taste right. Only the lanka was as expected, but you really can't mess up something out of a can.   Cute place, good concept but didn't deliver with the main thing - the ice cream.   3 stars for welcoming atmosphere, nice people, good service. Give them a try if you're into mild mellow flavors."}
{"text":"This place has the best ice cream! And the people there are super nice  and friendly. Prices are very reasonable  even cheaper compared to other  ice cream places."}
{"text":"I love the variety of flavors, quality, and flavor  They have soft serve as well as regular ice cream options as well as ice cream cakes. The staff is super friendly and it's Filipino family owned! Try the ube!!"}
{"text":"Best halo halo ever!!! Their ice creams are so good makes me want to order them all and also the staffs are very friendly. i would rate this place as 10/10!!!"}
{"text":"Has all the flavors I love. So hard to choose coz I just want all the Filipino flavored ice cream. Was able to have the ice cream cone and three scoops of different flavors, it's a winner for me :)"}
