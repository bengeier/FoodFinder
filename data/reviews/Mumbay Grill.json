{"text":"Unfortunately this place suffers from being on the same block as (what I believe to be) the best Indian restaurant in southern Ontario. This place is slightly cheaper, however. But is cheaper necessarily better?

The food is OK. Not great, not horrible. If you go for the buffet, in particular at dinner time during the week, it's hard to tell how long the food has been sitting there. It's rare to see new food brought out during this time of day.

The service is alright in the restaurant and if you order a la carte the portions are good. If you order take-out the portions are smaller but still decent. Finally, if you get delivery, you'll notice that the portions are tiny. I happen to think that's a bit of a dirty trick.

This place has changed hands a couple of times over the eight-or-so years I've lived nearby, and each change of owners has seen the quality suffer just a little bit. 

If it weren't for the fact that my kids sometimes like the buffet, I would stick with the other Indian restaurant on the block."}
{"text":"Dad, I'm sorry. You always taught me to try everything, never take more than you can eat comfortably and leave something for the next person.
I never got to everything because there was too many dishes to try and everything I had was incredible. So I just had to have more. Before I knew it, I was way over full and had trouble not going up again anyway. 
Forgive me, Dad, I'll try harder next time. But you'll have the close the place first. I've found my new dinner hangout."}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this restaurant. The sign actually says, \"Mumbai\" Grill but that's ok. The food was rich and the meats were all so tender. Will be going here from now on even if it takes 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Usually order off menu, not buffet. Korma chicken is amazing! Everything is fresh. Interior can be updated, but booths are comfortable. Best indian food in Durham."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic, delicious Indian food, this is definitely NOT it! 

As soon as we were sat down, the server told us to help ourselves at the dinner buffet. Since it was our first time, we thought they didn't have a la carte since that's all he offered. The buffet was terrible! You'd think they'd put they're best food and cooking out there but it was a huge disappointment. There wasn't a lot of variety to choose from. The salad bar, if you could even call it that, looked sad. The butter chicken was sweet, the roasted chicken masala was covered in this tasteless, artificial, thick, red sauce. Nothing was fresh. None of the food being served used any real spices, I felt. 

It was the most unauthentic Indian restaurant I've ever been to and I do know my spices. When we were ready to pay, they told us it was cash only which they failed to mention in the beginning, really annoying! 

Your poor belly will be so pissed at you if you took yourself there. Never again! Signature restaurant in Whitby is simply amazing, try that!"}
{"text":"My rating is based on my experience with their take out (directly and through just eat). Do not order when already starving, it usually takes 20 mins. 

You can tell the food is fresh and is always piping hot when we dish it out at home. The naan is my favourite from anywhere. 

We usually order a goat curry, beef vindaloo and karahi chicken. This place has become a regular in our house hold. Yum!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife, the foods fantastic. Very authentic Indian restaurant, my wife and I can't get enough of the butter chicken because it's so good. 

Overall it's clean and has a very good presentation. Neat and organized. Will love to visit other branches in the future."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! I've been visiting for a couple of years and I am always happy to come back to Bombay Grill. This is my favourite restaurant in GTA. Great food, reasonable price and comfortable atmosphere and customer service.
They have a great selection of tasty Indian cuisine at a reasonable price!  

Must eat:
Butter chicken/Saag Chicken"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and decided to get take out rather than eating inside. We had ordered before we came bus still had to wait for the food to get ready in the parking lot. The place was totally empty with the exception of a couple dinning at a booth. We ordered your typical order for two people. Now I don't know where they get the ingredients to make the food but this was the most I ever paid for Indian food. I was so shocked when I saw the bill I almost did not pay. WOW!! I mean come on that was really bad. Now I have no complainants about the food which was ok but was not worth the money we paid. I will not go back if these are the prices!!"}
{"text":"I use to eat here regularly. Got sick from the butter chicken the one time we ordered it and never ordered it again. Gave them the benefit of the doubt. 

Today I ordered the palak paneer and naan and aloo tikki. There was a crunch in my food and I didn't know what it was. Felt the crunch again so I reached into my mouth to pull it out - it was an open staple.

I just got off the phone with Telehealth and now I'm on my way to the hospital for an X-ray.

My husband had to leave work early to watch the baby so I can go to the hospital.

I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"we went pass this restaurant so many times in the past, today we had to have a Saturday night curry and decided to give this place a try.  I had my 10 and 9 years old boy, 25 years old sister, my wife with me. Ordered butter chicken, hairyali tikka , lamb biriyani , lamb korma and nan breads. Each and every one of the dishes were cooked to perfection. Amazing food! great price! 

This place has just become our Indian restaurant go to place . Did I mention that we had at least three guys serving us professionally and courteously at any given time."}
{"text":"Went for Dinner. Food was good and service friendly. Had Haryali Chicken & Karahai Chicken and both were very good. Loved the naan."}
{"text":"I did not like this place one bit. The reviews are far too high for this place. I went and saw flies all over the fruit and the chicken. The food wasn't good but that's just my opinion. The only 2 things I personally liked about this restaurant are the layout which is not what should matter, and the staff that were friendly."}
{"text":"Great Indian food at a great lunch price.
Being a huge fan of buffets, this is one of my favourites for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I, we're not Indian, but ADORE Indian food.
We've been to this restaurant at least 10x and each time we're never disappointed.
Anything I've ordered from the menu has been great, and my husband (who is more picky than I am, on food quality) agrees it's the best Indian restaurant he's ever been to.

For me, a good meal is a combination of some kind of biryani, with a vegetarian dish such as paneer or vegetable medley and a meat dish (lamb or chicken), accompanied by a mixed yogurt drink (i.e. non-Indians might call a 'smoothie' lol).

My husband ADORES the paan bread and butter chicken.

The price is reasonable, according the quality and portions. I find the service quick and the waiters not too pushy (but then again, we don't mind ordering too much - lol)."}
{"text":"Amazing!! We went here last night for dinner because I was craving butter chicken and some yummy naan. I told myself that I wouldn't get all-you-can-eat because it can get expensive. 

Anyway - we walked in to an almost empty restaurant (except 3 tables). The place was pretty big and the server asked us if we wanted to do buffet or menu. I said menu to look at the prices (most main courses are about $12.99. Then I moseyed around to the buffet to see what's on the table. I was blown away - usual items such as tandoori chicken, butter chicken, dal makhani, chickenpea curry, snacks like pakoras, etc. 

Then, the unusual - lamb curry, goat curry!! I couldn't believe it and then we said we wanted to do the buffet instead. It was only $14.99pp. Anyway - in the end, I can definitely say that it was totally worth it. Everything was great. They brought out fresh naan for us and refilled water frequently. I ate so much and everything was great. I really like the paneer makhani too! The paneer (cottage cheese) was soft and yummy - so good. 

I highly recommend and it's a great place for a large party too. I'm surprised it doesn't have any reviews! (WOO - first review!)"}
{"text":"Was here with my girl for their lunch buffet. After seeing such great reviews I decided to check it out. We got there about 145pm but they were still constantly bringing out hot food. Compared to other places they have a great variety of dishes to try out. Their butter chicken definitely stood out and was creamy and delicious. I also really enjoyed their pakoras and paneer. I love gulab jamun and theirs wasn't overly sweet, and a great way to end the meal. They bring out fresh naan for you at your table. The decor is pretty basic but still fine. The servers were very nice and friendly. The lunch buffet was only 9.99! How could you go wrong? Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Being of South East Asian descent, I can be very picky about going to any Indian restaurant, especially if it's an All-You-Can-Eat venue. Bombay Grill is quite an excellent place to eat if you're looking for some good Indian food. I usually go with the family when I'm out in Ajax, and have yet to be disappointed.

Friendly service, food is always fresh and there's no Indian tunes blaring out of the speakers!  (sorry, I'm kinda whitewashed like that).

My recommendations: Daal Makhani and the Lamb Curry. 

4-stars as I don't think, but am not sure that the desserts are fresh and they, just like any other AYCE have the same \"run of the mill\" ice cream.

Great place if you don't have a mom like me that cooks Indian food flawlessly!"}
{"text":"Went there for the buffet.  Food was good, but could have been hotter...possibly because we went early the food had not had a chance to warm up on buffet.  Butter chicken was excellent, the Naan was not bad but not the best we've had. The service was a bit on the slow side.  The dessert selection could have been better.  Rasmalai or some other desserts would have been a nice way to end our meal.  

For the price the buffet was a pretty good deal, but I have had better Indian buffets at other places.  We may go back to try ordering off the menu next time."}
{"text":"The decor is very asian oriented. I personally like it. This was the first time I have ever eaten at an Indian restaurant, and it was not disappointing at all. The food came hot and fairly quickly for the amount of people in the restaurant. The servers were extremely nice and helpful. I ordered the butter chicken, it came in a small looking bowl. Although the bowl looked small, it seems more of a mind trick. There was plenty of food left after I was stuffed. 

We went for dinner, so I can't comment on the buffet, since dinner is a-la carte. Also, their menu is huge, and prices are very reasonable. Expect to pay 15-20$ without alcohol per person."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for indian food when I am in the Pickering/Ajax area. 
I usually opt for the lunch/dinner buffet. The lunch I believe is $12.99 and dinner is $15.99.

The lunch included two types of rice, various chicken/goat/vegtable  such as butter chicken, tandori chicken, a goat dish, various tandori chicken, paneer, potato dish, eggplant dish and more!

There is also samosa's, spring, rolls, pakora, salad bar, and a dessert bar. They also provide you with fresh naan as you sit down. The service was great and the curries were all very flavourful. 

I left full and very happy!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian options like channa masala and mixed vegetables. Love the melons for dessert too! The service is polite and they play nice quiet Indian music. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Whenever I walk-in for the lunch buffet ($11.99) I am always greeted with such love and friendliness. The staff here are amazing and the service is fast. The lunch buffet is cheap and usually not busy during the day so you don't have to wait. The homemade naans are always great and one of the best I've had! My favorite from Mumbay Grill is the Fenugreek Chicken, a must try if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food, fast delivery, but unfortunately a little pricey. Lunch buffet is a great deal though if you're eating in. Favorite takeout orders are: Madras beef, Korma chicken, Paneer Makhani, Vegetable Pakoras, and Aloo Gobi. Their Paneer cheese is so creamy and flavorful - gotta try it!"}
{"text":"This place has disappointed me twice. I ordered palak paneer once and kadainpaneer another time from SkipTheDishes. 

Tje food is so oily. It's like you are drinking raw oil. This is t healthy and not at all tasty. I got a stomach upset."}
{"text":"We had a late night craving for Indian food and drove here before the doors closed. Nice of them to accommodate a last minute reservation. 

Our order was Butter Chicken with Rice and Chicken Tikka Masala and Naan. Curries were pretty good, slightly oily but not too much. Portion was a bit smaller than I expected for the price. Not fabulous by any means, but not bad either."}
{"text":"This place has been renamed to Mumbai Grill! 

The buffet here is really good and well worth the 9.99 price. Loved the chickpeas, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, & fish pakoras. 

The customer service was okay, nothing outstanding. 

The interior is decent, however the flooring needs to be updated - the rug was giving me & another guest in our group allergies, this was the only real downside to our visit.

However, will come back again for more of the good food in the future!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 - good value - excellent food. One of our regular Indian food places when we were in Ajax.

Buffet has an excellent selection of vegetarian and non-veg dishes.

- Naan is fresh
- Curry's are perfect (Medium)
- Basmati Rice (fluffy and cooked to perfection)
- Butter Chicken (not too sweet - which is good some places it is more like a dessert than a main dish)
- Pakora is very crispy and not greasy
- Samosa's nice consistancy in the pastry and good filling ratio

A wonderful variety of dishes and a good value for money.  Good place to go with a group of people, as something for everyone and you won't have to worry about someone not being satisfied with the food.

Can be busy in Mother's day, Father's day or those types of events.  Plenty of parking though.  I used to go to the place next door - but once I tried here I liked the food better at Bombay and also seemed cleaner and a better food selection on the buffet also."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is great and you can't beat their lunch buffet price!  The owner is really nice and the service is good.  I've been to another Indian restaurant in the neighbourhood but their food (and selection) can't compete with The Bombay Grill.  Delish!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of indian food however I am a big fan of good butter chicken. 14.99 for unlimited butter chicken and tandoori chicken is a good deal to me."}
{"text":"Good service & food. Would recommend to any one who want to try good Indian food in Ajax"}
{"text":"Good food, buffet selection is big.  might not be fresh food but it's good.  naan is fresh but the curries seem reheated.  Go during a busy time to avoid old food.  avoid takeout as they just grab it from the buffet and it's about the same price."}
{"text":"I recently visited Mumbay grill adamantly after having a mediocre visit before this. I have to say, the quality is much better now; seems like they are cooking their naans and curries fresh now. It's great to see that they have upped their standards and food quality again. The curries are absolutely delicious, flavour is great, and quantity is fair. Really impressed with how they've changed their dishes around this time, and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The last time I was here, it was called Bombay Grill. It looks the same, except a little more worn. It could use a facelift.

The lunch buffet offers around 12-14 main items, plus salads, condiments, and a small selection of desserts. Our server described the food as North Indian. Everything looked fresh and it tasted pretty good. I found the sauces had a little bit of sweetness in them. Sugar? The tandoori chicken was a little dry but okay. At $10.99, it's a great value!"}
{"text":"This place is da bomb!  They offer an all day buffet + a la carte service which is simply impressive.  We have dined in and had buffet take outs from here and the food is always just dynamite.  

I like that their flavours are not dummed down for the non-Indian palates.  Punchy (slightly salty at times) marinades season perfectly moist tandoori grilled meats and their curries are perfectly smooth and oh so yummy.  Just thinking about this place makes me happy.  

There is not one dish I've tried (from the buffet) that fell short on flavour.  The selection at the buffet is quiet good with at least 2 tandoori grilled meats, 8+ curries, a few different rice dishes and a good salad section with chutneys and pickles.  They also have some green chilies chilling out in a water-filled martini glass for those who like the spice.  I'm certainly one of them.  

I'm so glad this place is so close by as I'll be back for more for sure!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, restaurant was clean and someone greeted me right away to take my order for take out. The price was expensive for the amount of food they give you in a take out container. Portion for take out was small and can feed 2 people only. Food was ok but wouldn't be eating from them again. Too expensive for the amount of food portion they give."}
{"text":"I haven't seen too many sit down Indian restaurants in the Durham region, but this one had really good reviews so I decided to try it! The reviews were right!! The food and the service was very good! 

We had pakora's for appetizer which were delicious and tasted fresh! The mains were a good size and so were the sides! We ordered two dishes from the tandoor ( BBQ ) section and a vegetable jalfrezi. All the dishes were very well prepared. The chicken dishes had the perfect amount of marinate and was juiciest chickenI had ever had.  The BBQ dish was served on a sizzling plate garnished with raw tomatoes, onions and lettuce, I liked this because it was a healthier alternative to the sautéed onions in other restaurants. 

I can't wait to go and try their lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for Indian food, and are in Pickering, this place is your best bet. It doesn't get too busy often, because it is the suburbs after all, but it's definitely a good option. 

Their naans are always great and the Baingan ka Bharta is one of the best I've ever had. Their daal is a bit of a hit or miss sometimes though."}
{"text":"This was a delicious dinner buffet. Only 15 bucks a person. You can not go wrong. The only bad thing about this place is they are really slow when it comes to bringing out the naan bread. I mean like really slow. Its as if they dont want to give you the bread. We had two servers. The first guy really was so unhappy or something and seeemed annoyed that he had a customer lol. The larger server was spot on and super nice. The food was just amazing though. Fresh and hot and delicious. I would have given 5 stars if it was not for the server and bread problem. I suggest asking for extra bowl of bread right away."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've only gone for their lunch buffet but I go often and love it every time. They change up some of the entrees on the buffet too so I get to try new dishes and learn what I like. The service is always great and you can't beat the price for buffet."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find such a gem of a restaurant in the middle of suburbia serving some pretty authentic Indian food. 

For starters we had bhel puri, a delicious and refreshing puffed rice  'salad'. I didn't know it at the time but it was served perfectly as the rice puffs remained crunchy throughout! 

For mains, we had lamb korma and chicken biryani. Both were excellent, but the biryani was not as spicy as I like it (no fault of the restaurant as I requested a mild serving - I assume they can adjust the heat as required).

Didn't have any dessert but I did finish it off with some chai, which was the only disappointing this of the evening. Too weak and not very hot.   

Service-wise, the staff were very polite and attentive. I definitely will be returning when I'm back in Ontario."}
{"text":"Last December, I spent a Saturday in Ajax with a good friend. I had to pick up my new glasses (my prescription had improved!) and she had to wrap up her Christmas shopping. 

Hours later, we were hungry after exercising our credit and debit cards. I normally make a food suggestion. This time, she surprised me with the Mumbai Grill. I took it and drive us there. 

We were heading east along Kingston Road. There is no left turn lane that is safe to make to get into this plaza. So, I drove to the next set of lights and headed back, which isn't exactly a short distance!

Anyway, the restaurant is cozy. The buffet requires that you climb a short set of stairs. Just a thought that it wouldn't be convenient accessibility-wise for those using wheelchairs. 

The variety of curries, and vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes is incredible! My friend loved it here, as she is vegan. I enjoyed the fish, nan, pakora, tandoori chicken, ... everything!

We had a Christmas gift exchange. It's the perfect setting, as we could hear ourselves talk and it wasn't overly crowded at 7 pm. 

I'd go back here in a heartbeat for delicious food."}
{"text":"the chicken was pink and raw and got me very sick. do not eat here they do not cook their food"}
{"text":"Love this buffet. The selection is great, it all tasted amazing and is well priced.

The butter chicken was a little rich for my liking but overall all was delicious. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place at lunch.. now that I am in the Brampton area I just go to Tandoori Flame since it's All you can eat All Day Indian Food! But if I am ever in Pickering and it is around lunch hour (just in time for the buffet) I'm definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Indian food in Durham. The Naan is fresh, i really like the Peshwari Naan. I often take one home and have it for breakfast the next day. The Raita is nice, with a bit of tartness it makes an excellent foil if your main is a bit too spicy.  The mains that I've eaten have ranged from very good to excellent. 
I've been for their lunch buffet on a number of occasions, I especially like that the Naan they serve with the buffet comes straight out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"So hubby and I were really craving some indian food but our usual indian take out spot did not start delivery until 5pm. So I whipped out my Just Eat app to see if there was another local Indian spot that would deliver.
We stumbled onto this restaurant and decided to give them a try.
My whole order was done through the app so I did not have any contact with the restaurant. 
We ordered  
Beef Curry - Boneless fresh beef pieces cooked in a special Indian sauce
There were nice big chunks of tender boneless meat, good level of heat, and flavourful curry (this was our favourite dish out of everything ordered)

Lamb Karahi Gosht- Boneless lamb cooked with fresh onions, tomatoes, ginger, green pepper, coriander & Indian spices
This was in a thicker curry sauce but still very flavourful, the lamb was very tender as well and well spiced

Channa Masala- Spiced curried chickpeas
Chickpeas were cooked tender in a tomato based curry sauce

Aloo Gobi - Fresh cauliflower cooked with potatoes,tomatoes, onions and spiced
One of my favourite vegetarian dishes! Again cooked perfectly, vegetables not mushy at all still holding there shape and texture, nicely spiced as well

Garlic Naan - naans were on the thicker side, slightly chewy, very soft, generous in size and mild garlic flavour with tiny pieces of minced fresh garlic sprinkled on top

Basmati Rice - Fragrant and fluffy perfectly cooked rice 

Food took about 30 minutes to deliver and came piping hot, everything was fresh tasting and well spiced nothing was short on flavour here! The curries were portioned in plastic containers which were a bit tricky to open as they were a bit oily but the portion sizes were very reasonable. We will definitely be ordering from them again the next time we have a hankering for some Indian Food!"}
