{"text":"Great service and fantastic service. We were greeted as soon as we walked in. We ordered wings, bruscetta, and the penne alfredo. It was tasty. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I don't even like thin crust pizza, but Jz's pizza is one of the best I've ever had. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful, the staff were friendly and the ambiance was super pleasant. If you are looking for the hot new pizza place in Toronto Jz's is it, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best place to hangout for great food after a tour of Ripley's Aquarium and CN tower. I went there with my family and had the BEST homemade lasagna and pizza plus they serve alcohol. Everything is made from scratch and from basic ingredients. Ambiance is cool and staff are very friendly. MUST GO!"}
{"text":"We were staying across the street at the Residence Inn and we wanted a quick dinner that we could eat in our hotel room.  Jz's did not disappoint.  We tried Margherita and Canadian pizzas and both were great.  I had a nice salad as well.  We would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pizza was over cooked and pasta was undercooked. Only redeeming quality was the service was polite and the food came out fast."}
{"text":"In from NYC and staying in an executive suite apartment with no room service, so forced  to venture outside for food.  Stumbled on this place through a Yelp search and was not disappointed.  They have incredible thin crust pizza and this is coming from a NY pizza snob.  No kidding, it was really good, give it a try....."}
{"text":"Pizza crust is dry. Sauce is unique.
Overall dining experience and customer service are great but the actual pizza not so much. Did not try the pasta. The pizza toppings and composition are well thought out but not necessarily filling.
The pizza serving is good for one per person."}
{"text":"Beautiful, modern interior! Staff are very kind. Everyone seems eager to give you the best experience possible. They even insisted on replacing my Coke can because they noticed a dent on the side. Pizza is good and comes at a very fair price! I hope to see this place do well!"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza and friendly service at a family-owned place--what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Ordered cheesesteak pizza.  All ingredients were very fresh. Service was fast and professional.  Pizza tasted wonderful with a nice aftertaste from the seasoning.  Thin tasty crust.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Their take out special is amazing. I get it at least once a month. This is the only pizza place I order from. Pizza is delicious and fresh"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was excellent. We had the Canadian Pizza and the Amsterdam beer."}
{"text":"I had a party with a couple of friends and we decided to try this place since it had good reviews. We placed our order online and since it was Saturday night, the delivery estimate was 45-55 minutes. After an hour and a half, I gave them a call to see where my order was, and they said they'll call me back \"in less than a minute\". I waited for a while and didn't receive a call, so I tried to call again but nobody would pick up the phone. After another half an hour of trying, they finally picked the phone up and connected me to their delivery department, which there they told me \"we're sorry we can't deliver your order\". I asked why can't you deliver and why are you telling me this after two hours, but they just kept repeating the same sentence without providing any explanation. At this point, I just hung up the phone and called somewhere else to get the pizza and finally after 3 hours we were able to get our pizza."}
{"text":"Maybe we came on an off day but this was really nothing special. Margherita pizza was just shredded cheese pizza with little flavour, and the salad was just ok - nice toppings but iceburg lettuce made it a bit bland. Everything was meh. I had high hopes... the prices were way too high for what we got."}
{"text":"Tasty jz's signature pizza and penne pasta
Staffs were rly friendly
Close to go after looking around aquarium and cn tower"}
{"text":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. The pizza was bland and their salad looked like brown mush when we got it delivered. Their bacon tasted funny and my fianc√©e had ordered their ravioli and got 5 pieces which was severely undercooked and had no flavor. I don't know how this place has gotten such high reviews! If your looking for a Margherita Pizza to look more like a cheese pizza with maybe 4 flecks of basil (not leaves, just little flecks) then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I can only speak for having the pizza and wings delivered. We've never actually gone to the restaurant. The pepperoni pizza is pretty good, 4 stars. The wings are just okay, 3 stars."}
{"text":"The food was really good.  My kids loved the pizza.  I had the apple/pecan salad and it was also very good.  I would recommend JZS as a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place hidden away on Wellington - there is limited seating inside and outside on the patio. They have a medium pizza and beer special (~$11) - good deal before heading over to a Jays game at the nearby Rogers Centre. My boyfriend really likes their Canadian pizza and I usually get the seafood linguine which comes with a surprisingly good number of scallops and shrimp!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I have ever had even though it took a bit long that the pizza come outs,but it was definitely worth to wait. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love places like this cozy restaurant feel , personable  bartender/waiter and someone's grandma in the kitchen making authentic meals. I think it's a family restaurant but its very clean abd trendy. The pizza is amazing I can't wait to go back and try a pasta dish. The service is top notch and the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"We started with salads, nothing fancy, but nicely cut and obviously fresh with a good vinaigrette.  

I was very happy with the pizza they served me here.  Nice crust, good toppings and great service.  I asked the waiter to keep the basil on my margherita to a minimum, they did, I was happy.

We drank rum and coke, the pour was generous, I was even happier.

I was worried this would be a tourist trap, it was not."}
{"text":"Not bad! Ordered the JZ pizza and the chicken pesto pasta. The pizza crust was a consistent thickness throughout, but it wasn't that chewy/fluffy which is my preference. Lots and lots of raw garlic flavour though  which I liked. Penne pasta had a chewy texture and tasted fresh. The sauce was good too. But I thought maybe both dishes were overly seasoned (for my tastes). I tend to like when the seasoning is more subtle, so that I can taste more of the ingredients themselves. 

They're working on getting a liquor license, so should have alcohol soon!"}
{"text":"- great pizza and salad
- quiet comfortable atmosphere 
- served quickly 

- sweet tea was not sweat tea and was charged for refills without being told"}
{"text":"The reviews are all pretty much bang on. Extremely cozy (less than 20 seats plus a long bar). Food came quick and was excellent. If you are here with a  large group call ahead. Still pretty much a quiet little stop but as soon as people realize the quality along with the speed of service it probably will start getting pretty busy. Come here before you have to start waiting for seats."}
{"text":"Visited this place per Aron's suggestion and it did not dissapoint. 

My boyfriend and I had just finished a long day of walking and traveling and it everything was closed since it was 11pm. 

Thank god this place was open. It was quiet and cozy, very inviting. We were welcomed warmly by a man who seated us with menus. 

I ordered a sub and my boyfriend ordered a pizza. The food was really good. Warm, homemade style, tasty. It wasn't the best sub in the world but it was definitely worth a stop.

Service is good, music is good, prices are good. No complaints here.

Visited on June 30th 2017"}
{"text":"YUM!  Everything is so fresh and tastes home made. The pizza is flavorful and the crust is perfect (not too thick so you won't feel stuffed after).   Their signature salad dressing is also great!  The pesto sauce was amazing (very fresh and flavorful) and I highly recommend the Nutella pizza for desert. 

They serve great portions and the ambiance is really nice. Location is also a bonus- walking distance from CN tower and you even get a nice view of the tower if you sit outside or by the door. Overall great vibes."}
{"text":"Pros - service was good, the pizzas are loaded with toppings.

Cons - the crust was a bit burnt and it's a crispy crust which is not my usual preference.  The seating is limited (although it's not packed) but it feels like a spot for take out."}
{"text":"You can't really find anything wrong with this place, the pastas and pizzas are both amazing and high quality, the price is very reasonable, the owner and the staff are very friendly, if you're in downtown check this place out, a lot of people think just because it's downtown there are lots of options around but that's not always the case as there is also a lot of poor quality food in downtown as well."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a quick bite to eat and decided that pizza would do. Did we get pizza? No, no we did not. But, only bc there were so many items on the menu that sounded delicious, and they were.  We ordered the caprese salad, ravioli, and steak sandwich. It was awesome. Flavors were on point. This place is on the small side though, with tables only on one side so there might be a little wait if they get busy. Overall it's a nice little place that I would def recommend. Hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for take it for locals.  

It's a thin crispy crust that doesn't feel you feeling bloated. Fresh ingredients, reasonable prices and a fast turn around.   

They don't seem to get a lot of sit down business, but I think Uber eats and foodora keep them busy.  

Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Thank you Yelp. Was delicious. Thin crust lots of cheese and quality ingredients. Would eat here anytime. Was also very fairly priced with excellent service. Loved it."}
{"text":"Staying at the Marriott across the street and we wanted something quick to take back to the room. I am happy we did because the pizza was excellent. This is coming from a NJ / NY person. Canadian pie was excellent and the plain as well. The garlic bread was more like garlic bread chips which were great as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this little place. Great thin(-ish) crust pizzas. Salads were nice also. There is some seating at tiny tables and I can recommend eating in for the nice wine by the glass."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok. The lunch special at 8.99 for a medium with a drink is a good value."}
{"text":"Poor service and mediocre food. I was busy running errands and wanted quick but tasty takeout so I  decided to check out the new Jz's Pizza. The restaurant is located where an older Pizza Rustica used to be situated on Wellington Street. 

Service - I spoke to the waitress on the phone about my take out order. She told me that the food would be ready for me in 15-20 minutes, at most. When I arrived around 20 minutes later, she told me the food was almost ready. Nearly 40 minutes after I initially placed the order, she told me the exact same thing - food will almost be ready. It wasn't until about 50 minutes later I actually got my food. Although I don't mind take out taking 50 minutes to prepare - especially if it's good take out - what turned me off was misled that my food was almost ready when it was in fact not.

Food - Quite disappointing. I ordered the Linguine di Mare while my friend ordered the Spaghetti and meatballs. Both were underwhelming - my linguine lacked taste while the meatballs were rock hard for some reason. However, the spaghetti was prepared and flavoured decently.

The only saving grace from my experience was the price. The linguine was $15, while the spaghetti was $14, which offers a better price option for the Downtown area."}
{"text":"Great little place that packs an amazing Italian flavor.  Had the Lasagna and Margherita pizza - Outstanding.  The sauce for the lasagna was so tasty.  The cheese on the pizza was creamy and the dough had the perfect crunch."}
{"text":"The service was really good. The seafood pizza was delicious! My only real complaint was the chicken wings. I'm pretty sure they're the frozen wings from sams club. The meat had a really odd non fresh chicken like texture and it totally rubbed me the wrong way. Honey garlic sauce was good though!"}
{"text":"Very good gluten-free pizza. I'm accustomed to paper thin GF pizza but this was the thickest I've had yet. Great service."}
{"text":"Why anyone would go to Boston Pizza when this family owned and operated, local pizza joint is only a block away is beyond me! I stopped in for lunch at 12:30 on a Saturday, and was the only person there for most of my meal. The owner, who was working as the server, was very friendly and the interior atmosphere was really nice: cozy, modern, and clean. My Canadian pizza was perfect - a thin crispy crust, generous toppings, tasty sauce, and just the right amount of cheese. They had some more creative pizzas on the menu too, for the more adventurous. Stop by here for lunch or dinner and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great little spot that's still under the radar and will be a great local haunt once it has its liquor license. The sandwiches are surprisingly good and the pizza is tasty. The personal touch from the owner's presence definitely makes for a great impression, too."}
{"text":"The food was great. To start of the garlic bread is one of the beast breads I have ever had. The forni fritto melanzane is great aswell. The caneloni was good but a bit disappointing because the pasta was bland and felt like it was microwaved. But other starters look amazing."}
{"text":"This restaurant was an unexpected surprise. We were looking for a lunch place that was close to the city centre, and landed here by chance. The Jz's Signature Pizza had plenty of fresh toppings and bright flavors on a thin crispy base. We also got the braised beef ravioli, which had 7 large ravioli's stuffed with a sizable amount of tender braised beef. Both dishes seemed home made and was perfect for a quick italian lunch.

The space itself is small, with one row of bench/table seating opposite the bar. We were only the second group of people there during lunchtime on a weekday, so was free to sit anywhere we wanted. It never got too busy, with the maximum of three groups of people at anytime. The service was friendly and prompt, checking up on us periodically to make sure we were finding everything okay. Will keep this place in mind for a quick bite to eat next time."}
{"text":"Great little place. I had the signature pizza and my wife had a garden salad with chicken and both were excellent. Nice selection of beers and Italian wines."}
{"text":"Ordered a late night pizza here. Service was great, he was really attentive & friendly. However the pizza was bland. Though you can tell they use fresh ingredients, the pizza overall lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Definitely a new place. There are empty shelves behind the counter because I believe they are still waiting on final approval for their liquor license. 

The food is mostly pizza and pasta, and it is all amazing! Freshly made, fresh ingredients, and well prepared. Wait staff is very attentive and friendly. It is a smaller place though, so larger groups may have a problem fitting, but otherwise no complaints. Has quickly become my favorite place in the Convention Center area!"}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the Diavola pizza and a pasta dish. Everything was cooked perfectly. The service was excellent and we had good to take home. The olives and flavored on the pizza were outstanding! - Thank you

Also, turned out that the server's mother was who did the cooking and baked the pizzas. Tasted like homemade. Definitely we return when we're back in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in for pizza and beer before a Jays game on a Thursday night. We were able to get a table right a way which was nice. Nice atmosphere. Service was a bit slow but serviceable.  

Pizza itself was less than memorable. Crust was soft. Sauce was minimal and tasteless. 

Prices were reasonable but I would have paid more for better pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and tomato sauce and was very disappointed. The meatballs were dry and the sauce was overly acidic and did not taste home made. Definitely not recommended if you appreciate good Italian good."}
{"text":"Came by for an early dinner, sat outside and people watched. Service was spotty, we had to wave down our server one to many times, but it wasn't too bad. Cute space, clean and close to our hotel. Had a pecan cranberry apple salad that was surprisingly filling,the tomato moss app was really good,  large roni pie for us, and individual pizza and a philly cheesesteak sandwich with the sweetest peppers. Good experience, wold come back."}
{"text":"Nada sobresaliente. No es malo sin embargo por el precio esperaba algo que realmente valiera la pena. Estoy seguro que se pueden encontrar mejores lugares con los mismos precios."}
{"text":"I made a Ritual takeout order from Jz's Pizza yesterday, so I didn't spend more than a few minutes inside, therefore my review is only about the food.  Jz's offers a wide variety of pizzas , subs, pasta plates, and desserts to choose from.

I went with the Create Your Own Pizza option and was very pleased with the selection of ingredients to choose from.  You can pick from 7 different sauces, 6 cheeses, multiple meats, veggies, and seafood options, and also combine them.  I ordered a small pizza with many of my favourite vegetables (if you know me you'll know why that's funny ;P).  Take a look at my pictures for a full description.  I also ordered a very decadent Peanut Butter Fudge Brownie Cheesecake for dessert - which is gluten free if you're looking for that sort of thing.

I picked up the pizza, brought it home, and tucked in.  It was delicious!  Fresh, juicy, flavour-packed, basically just perfect and just what I was looking for.  The crust was tasty as well and had a nice crunch around the edges, just the right amount!

Thinking about it now, I'm resisting the urge to order another one immediately.

All this to say, I really enjoyed the pizza, and the dessert, and I'm excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Had the spaghetti and meatballs to go. The taste was slightly below average. Tasted/looked like fast food pasta you can get at a foodcourt for 5.99. Very overprice! Paid 14.99 (US dollar) for a small pasta dish that tasted not so great. Wouldn't recommend for the price you pay."}
{"text":"In Toronto for a show and needed something quick to eat beforehand, this place was right across the street from our hotel. Needless to say, it was quick, cheap, and tasty! The crust was perfect and their pizzas had unique combinations of toppings. We had the Jz Pizza. If we come back to Toronto, I will definitely eat here again. Next time I would like to try the pasta dishes, too."}
{"text":"Dropped in here with my girlfriend late on a weeknight, and found it totally empty, which we didn't find surprising. We were greeted with excellent service, and we enjoyed having the place to ourselves.

I had a glass of Chianti and a pepperoni pizza (really great combo), while she just had a pasta primavera, which she found truly exceptional. She is picky with her pasta, and still will cite this dish as one of her favorites ever. We were surprised to find out the family who owns it is not Italian, but they cook like they are! 

Highly recommend Jz's for your Italian cravings. The service is kind and professional, the food is delicious, the pricing appropriate, and the ambiance is nice for a casual family outing."}
{"text":"I live jusy above them and eat here all the time. Pizza is amazing and the staff are great. Didnt love the steak sub."}
{"text":"Our family had an amazing experience, both culinary and service-wise. This is a perfect \"hole-in-the-wall\" Italian restaurant. Well worth the money."}
{"text":"Extremely horrible experience with this pizza place. We ordered Biancoverde Pizza for 18.00$ first of when it came it was smaller then any small pizza from any other chain, secondly crust was paper thin, thirdly we advised them to hold the Salami but when the pizza arrived it was a HOG fest on the pie...asked the manager to remake it and he remakes it with soggy cheese 2 pieces of bell peppers and smelly beef...

For the high price and low grade ingredients this place is a definite SKIP."}
{"text":"Small location, but it's a standout! Great dinner stop waiting to visit CN Tower or Blue Jays game.  The pasta dishes were excellent- yummy Cannelloni. The pizza was delicious- no problem for the guys to eat the whole thing. Pizza Margherita was great.  Dulce de Leche cheesecake and expresso finished it off well!"}
{"text":"The inside is pretty and the outdoor patio has a good view all-around, but the food was not the best especially the wings. The most unusual chicken wings I've ever eaten. I really couldn't finish them. Other than taste and feel, I also couldn't finish them for the sake of getting to my bus on time being a walk around 30 minutes. So, it was a so-so pizzeria!"}
{"text":"We've been eating pizza and pasta across Canada from Quebec City to Toronto so we tried this great little Italian urban bistro near the Marriott Residence Inn on Wellington. We asked the nearby baristas if they liked it, and the whole crew chimed in with rave reviews.  Newly opened by experienced restauranteur-brothers, the family-owned nature comes across in great service. Too new to have a website (in progress), the owner graciously explained the menu to me over the phone. 

We loved the margherita pizza, braised beef ravioli with pesto sauce (with mushrooms added as suggested) and the meatball sub with a super fresh side salad. In fact, everything was super fresh. The setting is modern-urban while still being friendly and relaxing. And the prices are very reasonable--a great value. A welcome contrast and great addition to the Entertainment District."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. A bit pricey for personal pizzas but the Mediterranean pizza is delicious and believe it or not the spaghetti and meat balls is also darn good. I got the cheese pizza for my son, it was average. Salad is also mediocre. Good service. No major concerns. I'd go again."}
{"text":"5 stars for saving the day. We ordered food from another place and they were a no show. So after midnight, starving and grumpy, we placed an order here through foodora. I called and they received the order immediately. Food came in 25 minutes and was delicious. Will order again or maybe check it out in person."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great food. I should have walked in here a long time ago. Real Italian food with quick great service"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good-- very fresh and thin crust.  Love the fact that it is very intimate and the chef came out to see how we liked the food.  The pasta is homemade and my daughter is use to the box kind so she didn't love it.  The chef was kind enough to make her a small cheese pizza instead:). Once they get there wine/ liquor license, 5 stars.  Go and check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't really know why this place has a good review. Ordered the braised beef ravioli and an all meat pizza. The food looks good but It was super bland, no flavor. Not worth the price. Felt like I'd be better off ordering pizza hut, but this was within walking distance. Ordered for pick-up. The waiter didn't even include utensils, had to ask. Was only given a fork and no napkins."}
{"text":"Dropped in here one day for a late lunch, we got a pizza and a pasta. Service was fast and friendly and food was very tasty. Also very reasonably priced given the location."}
