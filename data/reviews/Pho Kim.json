{"text":"Make sure to get their Spring Rolls... it was delicious!!  Their shrimp and chicken soup was great as well as their rare meat pho!"}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST broth. Hands down. First visit was awesome and delicious. I didn't know my second visit (two days later) could be even better. You don't even have to dress it up because the broth is that good. I got the Pho Tai (my go to always). Staff is excellent. The only thing is the music is weird for the setting, and only one tiny speaker in the corner of the bar. But who cares when the food is excellent. I can't wait to go back and try something different!"}
{"text":"Been to many other pho places in the area and this is definitely my favorite. Restaurant is very clean, very nice staff and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Ive only tried the pho, but its very good. It is as good as any good pho Ive had in the Valley."}
{"text":"Food was WRETCHED when I came, I should've taken cues when I walked in and there was nobody there! My friend and I ordered the Vietnamese dripping coffee which she said they had. Waitress came back 15 minutes later with iced coffees in cups! I asked nicely what happened to our dripping coffee and she rudely answered the machine wasn't working. Should've told us before she served us! After waiting another 15 minutes for her to get our order (and a customer that came after us got his order first!), we waited another 10 minutes or so for our chicken pho to arrive. The plate of plentiful bean sprouts and basil leaves that usually  comes with pho at other restaurants was a tiny platter of cut cabbage and a lime!! Wtf????? This place is a poor imitation of the real thing, I'm sticking to central Phoenix pho joints for my pho cravings."}
{"text":"Nice dining environment. Good place to have an intimate conversation/dinner date. The broth was rich, the noodles were nice. My friend and I ordered two bowls of pho with different types of meats and all of it was very good. Came with the staple accoutrements and it hit the pho spot! Best pho I've had in Phoenix so far."}
{"text":"The bun bo hue is amazing, everything is made to order. The owner Kim is very sweet as well"}
{"text":"This place is best at services. I've been here 3-4 times. We got Pho, Spicy soup, vegetarian rice with mixed veggies, clear rice noodles soup and spring rolls. The food was delicious, especially the spring rolls. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Moved to Phoenix recently and was told to try Pho Kim. GREAT customer service!!! Pho and spring rolls were great. I definitely recommend it and will be back for more."}
{"text":"Pho Kim is a pretty nice restaurant.  Great service first of all, but I like the fact that Kim KNOWS the food is good. She stands by it.    We tried the egg rolls for our appetizer.  I forgot what meat was in it (lol), but they were tasty and crispy.  For the first time, I tried pho.  I got the pho with shrimp, served with noodles, basil, bean sprouts and jalapeño slices.  The beef broth is rich and flavorful, good texture on the noodles.  Shrimp was nicely cooked, large and tender.  Fresh bean sprouts add a good crunch to the pho, goes well with the spicy jalapeños and fragrant basil leaves. I ate it until it was gone.  I also ordered an iced Vietnamese coffee with my meal. Delicious!  Had a slightly chocolatey taste, but I don't think there was any in there.  Sweet, but not overly sugary.  Good and strong, just like I like it.  Pho Kim has a great variety of dishes on their menu, and I definitely would love to come back and try more of their food."}
{"text":"Came here on a proxy recommendation (friend of a friend) who said that it was the best pho he'd had outside of his mom's house. While this may have been the case for him, it still didn't satisfy my craving.  Ordered a bowl of pho dac biet and a bowl of bun dac biet. The pho was on the smaller side with regards to noodles and broth, but there was a decent amount of meat included. Broth was still too sweet for my taste - I've yet to find a restaurant rendition that is actually savory and beefy without being overly sweet (outside of my mom's house). The bun dac biet was a good size and had a good mix of meat with shrimp, pork, and chicken - I'd order this again. The only knock was that the chicken had the dreaded \"woody breast\" syndrome (look it up if you don't know what it is). I'm not holding this against them since I've bought and cooked chicken that had the same issue, but it was unfortunate.  The space inside was open and clean. Service was a little slow. 3 stars for the combined experience, but probably a little higher if you take the pho out of the equation."}
{"text":"Expansive menu. Beautiful dishes.  Crispy good quality veggies and tender, well spiced meat.  Very comfortable and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"The veggie Pho is delicious. A nice variety of veggies, and mushrooms included. Very clean and stylish interior. Good date spot, when I went it was very quiet and intimate."}
{"text":"the spring rolls were exceptional, the sauce a little sweeter than I like.  I tried the Pho Dac Biet and am impressed.  I will go back"}
{"text":"Ordered Egg Noodle with Chicken Breast.  Presentation was nice, but the taste was a bit bland and dry.  Not too much kick from the spices.  The so-so flavor and amount of food doesn't feel worth the $12 - $13 cost.  I can tell they're going for more of a upscale date-night experience, but the numbered stickers on the table corners cheapened the feel and the corny smooth jazz radio station playing over the speakers didn't help.  The server was polite and refilled our water but took about 15 - 20 minutes to collect our check.  Overall, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great.  Would consider going back only if the prices were lower."}
{"text":"Opening a Vietnamese restaurant in an area that already has a significant number of Vietnamese eateries seems to be a risky proposition, but this one should not only survive the competition but actually thrive. Their dishes are very well-made, the ingredients are really fresh, the flavor of the broth of the soup dishes reflects an expert blending of long-simmered broth and herbs. Like most Vietnamese restaurants, the items offered are pretty inexpensive. The restaurant is very spacious, service is fast and friendly, and location is great - in the same huge commercial plaza as the AZ international market, so it is easy to get to and parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"Best pho place ever, hands down! I've been to several different pho places and nothing beats pho kim! Me and my boyfriend come here often!"}
{"text":"The pho here was actually good, but the servers were extremely miserable to be at work and they gave little to no service to my group. They had a bad attitude and when I mentioned the coke was flat she gave me a stank face and didn't even ask if I wanted something else. I saw other customers just picking up and even they left rolling their eyes at the horrible customer service."}
{"text":"A newer pho place by some pretty solid pho joints nearby already so I was skeptical at first. Located in the international mekong plaza so finding this place and parking is no problem at all. I was already dying as I walked in (of hunger and a hangover) so the smell of anise had me hopeful of a good bowl. We started with spring rolls which my friend stated was the best presentation she's ever seen for a spring roll. I got a dac biet and it was pretty good. The broth was really good not too sweet and just savory enough for me and the bowl was packed. The only thing that holds it back from the fifth star was the meat wasn't the best I've had or close but its there. I'll definitely give this place another try to see if maybe I just misjudged because of my prior day's sins."}
{"text":"This is  a solid Pho spot. Very comfortable dining experience and we had a a large party which they accommodated well."}
{"text":"Chicken Pho with extra beef meatballs is exactly what I need and want when I'm staring to feel a little sickish. Yes fall has made its way in and i was in need of a great soup. This recipe is one the owner has worked to perfect for years!  You can taste it!  Totally worth stopping in!   Stopped in again still so so good."}
{"text":"I went to this place once and I already love it. The pho noodle soup is a must try. I like how the soup taste. The chicken wings are also super good. They smell incredible.  If you order pho, ask for the spicy chili oil to add some kicks to it."}
{"text":"This is our FAVORITE pho spot! Everyone here takes great pride in their service and we really feel like family coming in. We're greeted right away, she knows our regular seating and order by heart LOL  But besides the outstanding service, we would come back time and time again for the pho ! They hit it out of the ball park  you can taste the love and time in the broth! I promise you won't be disappointed, and you'll be just as hooked as we are!"}
{"text":"Was in town for business and found this new restaurant. The chicken vermicelli bowl was great! The chicken was not dry and the portions were large. I was pretty impressed and would come back if I am ever in town again."}
{"text":"My wife & I ate here many occasions, since the last review. The service is friendly, polite & efficient.   Their Pho Dac Biet (house special beef noodle soup) is above typical, with the broth pretty savory.   The vegetarian lo mein is full of flavors, yet lighter than the version with meat.   We will eat at this restaurant again when having the opportunity to."}
{"text":"Happy New Pho Destination!  I came out of the International Marketplace and saw Pho Kim and thought Pho Me I better try this out!   Seriously though... I am a big fan of Pho! This place didn't disappoint at all!  We were greeted by two friendly ladies when got there and were sat down immediately in the large dining room of clean tables with a fresh and clean smell in the air.  We got a nice $10.95 XL bowl of Pho... The broth was fresh and tasty. All in all this was a good bowl of Pho.   I really liked the ambiance here and how it is spread out so you are not crammed into the people next to you or sharing a table with strangers like some places....  The parking lot is huge so no worries about finding easy parking.   Stop in for a tasty feeding, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"The place was very nice and very open. I liked the simple decor and that the design wasn't too overwhelming. We had ordered stir fry noodles and beef pho. The stir fried noodles tasted okay. There were barely any noodles and the noodles were clumped together. The pho was good but had so little meat in there. Literally about 4 pieces of meat. I think the broth tasted okay. It wasn't too bland and had some flavor to it. I think if they were to tweak it a little it would taste better. The Thai tea is very powdery/milky. It does taste like instant tea of some sort that has regular milk to it.   The staff is very friendly and offered to attempt to make the tea better so we could take it home though, it was still too instant tea tasting and not authentic. I think this place has potential if they work on their food a little more."}
{"text":"New place in mesa right next to the international market.  Today was their opening day.  They still have some bugs to work out but the staff was extremely friendly.   The spring rolls and nem noung were delicious.  I honestly expected more out of the pho, but it was just ok.  This is why I'm giving the 4 stars.  Very clean n beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"We tried this place with a Groupon.  Located in the International Marketplace parking lot.  A large clean place with nice staff.  We both ordered the B1 , vermicelli with grilled shrimp, pork, egg roll and chicken.  The food came quickly along with the fish sauce to pour over the noodles.  The staff mopped the floor while we ate and the smell of the cleaning solution was not a good thing.  While we appreciate a clean environment, next time wait until your place is empty.  The food was good with both grilled shrimp and chicken.  Plenty of food with nicely  pickled daikon and carrots.  Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Seriously great pho. There is a lot of meat in each bowl so you get what you pay for. I'll be trying the filet mignon pho next time."}
{"text":"This pho place is great! I love their bun bo hue and the fried rice. The taste is no kidding because I can taste the traditional taste I have been looking for. I also like their spring rolls because the sauce is amazing! The servers are really nice to me and I will come back."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. Especially the Bún Bò Hu and chicken wings. Me and my friends always have chicken wings whenever we go here."}
{"text":"This place was really nicely decorated and I the food was good. We were hungry on a cool winter day and drove here for some pho."}
{"text":"What a great start for a small business I will be coming back for the pho but I'll try the other food"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we stopped by this little hidden gem. They open early so that a.m  Pho craving can be satisfied. And the pho is lovely. First it comes in a huge heavy bowl that helps keep the heat in. The broth it's self is on point and they bring all the correct condiments to enhance it. The spring rolls are lush and generous in size. My sister got a vermicelli dish and the pork and shrimp were perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"First time coming here and all I can say is the service was fantastic and the food was delicious!!! I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Located in the same plaza as International Market. Right next to LA Crab.  Decided to give this place a try since some of our go to pho restaurants are closed on certain days.  They have a variety of different types of pho. We went with the P5 $8.95 for a regular size bowl and $10.95 for a large bowl. Since we shared a bowl between two people we went with the large.  The broth had lots of flavor. You can always tell how long the broth has been boiling in the bone marrow and beef by the flavor!  They were not stingy with the meat at all. Large pieces of brisket, tendon and rare beef.  Another great pho spot!"}
{"text":"Fist time here service was horrible. Ordered a coffee and the waiter went to the supermarket to get it...???. Big mix up on the pho orders waiter did not know which orders were which. Waiter did not come back to check on  us for refill on water. No chili oil. Food was average nothing really stands out except for the spring rolls."}
{"text":"1st time and I love it! I'm super picky about eating new food but these places is gooooddd! Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST Pho I've had in a long time! Spring rolls were amazing too! The owner was kind, the entire staff were full of smiles and extremely friendly! I live in Maricopa and am more than willing to make the drive here to have it everyday.... if gas prices were better !!"}
{"text":"I went here because the owner of the nail salon I go to said his wife cooks here. I ordered the pho chicken..it was very good. But the atmosphere was strange...no music or background noise...just quietness...and the sound of the waitress' flip flops. Soup was 8.95..she charged me 10.00...she said \"it's because of tax and I charge you 25 cents for take home container, it cost me to buy the container so I have to charge you\"....rude and weird. Id only go back if unphogettable is closed...and unphogettable is never closed."}
