{"text":"It would be more of a 2.5 stars but decided on a 2 star because I asked myself, would I want to come here again? The answer is probably no. 

The quality of the desserts were OK, standard desserts. We also ordered the popcorn chicken which was good. The thing is the portions of the desserts were very small!!  So the desserts are priced above average and they gave you less.  Not worth it in my POV. 

Maybe the decor and setup of the restaurant have something to do with it too... Throughout the entire night, the staff were cleaning their dishes and utensils at the front with loud clinking noise. This kind of thing is usually done behind the scenes. So they are not professional at all. It really ruins the mood and ambience if you are chatting with friends. 

The pluses: the staff were friendly and nice. Convenient location. Juicy popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"Really a nice and new place to go. I love the popcorn chicken and black sticky rice with coconut milk series?It has a lot of selections of Chinese dessert. Will try different one each time I go."}
{"text":"Difficult to find a Chinese dessert place, especially in the downtown area so I was very excited to walk by this place one day. I actually came by for my lunch break and got a curry chicken rice. It was different from what I expected since I was anticipating a thick Japanese style curry but I got a thin watery, almost Hong Kong style kind of curry. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I also ordered an original milk tea and thought it was A-OK. My friend who got the Taiwanese minced pork rice though found it very enjoyable and thought it was fairly accurate to Taiwan. My slight gripe was that another table had come in after us and got their food before us as my friend and I sat there waiting for 40 min. before we came to the conclusion that our food went to the other table and the silence from the kitchen indicated that they were not making our meal at all. After we complained though we got our meal fairly promptly.

We visited again for dessert. My friend ordered the mango pancake while I ordered the black glutinous taro soup with pearls. Unfortunately the menu didn't indicate that I can get a heated version of the soup, since I would've preferred it that way. The mango pancake though was great, though I wish they didn't serve it with generic ice cream which lowered the quality of the dish overall. I will note that both desserts came in fairly hefty portions and will be fairly filling as a large snack."}
{"text":"This place showed up after having typed \"durian\" as a search term for locations near me, so I was pretty excited of the prospects that this place offered durian desserts/drinks.
Tonight, I was highly disappointed when I walked all the way here to find out that it wasn't opened according to its store hours. :/

It was cold and snowing, so yea, I'm a little bitter about it."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!!!!!!! Both the service and food are terrible. The taro slush tasted like ice water, and the mango crepe cake was all frozen and hard like ice tube. I told the server and and a guy from the kitchen (probably the boss?) that i wished to add a bit more flavor to my drink because it was literally tasteless. Initially, they questioned my word - tasteless, and did not apologize for their bad drink and took it away. I thought they would make me a new one or at least put more taro powder or even sugar in it, but no. They pour the old thing back into the blender and added more ice? Excuse me? because it turned out even worst then before??? I spoke mandarin to them so Im sure that they fully understand what I asked for, but you put more ice in??? UNBELIEVABLE!!! When we had enough and decided to leave, we told them that the drinks is bad (and they are like 3.99 each, not worth the money at all), and they said nothing...wow, I was shocked. And of course, we waited for 5 minutes for the card machine to work, cuz we didn't bring cash. And for the entire waiting time, they were so quiet like they did nothing wrong. I would NEVER go back EVER again!"}
{"text":"Came here because this place closer for me compare to Sugar Marmalade for chinese desserts. 

This place is the usual asian caf√© but with bad interior design... Like they didn't even bother to make the place look special. But whatever I come here for the food and dessert. 

I've been here 3 times since it opened last weekend (nov.8th, 2014) I've tried their: 


- ?????? (house special mango black grass jelly mixed) 6.49 not bad but since mangos are not in season mango cubes were a bit sour. Mango Mixture base was decent.
- ???? (popcorn chicken rice) 7.49 I'm pretty sure some of their food is premise and then microwaved but most tea shops are like this to be honest. At least popcorn chicken is freshly fried. It comes with half of a marinated egg and some cooked lettuce, pretty good for a casual meal) 
- ????????(Taro sago mixed and Pearl delight) 4.49 I really like this one! The pearls are sweet and chewy and taro tastes good with the coconut milk and sago mixture.
- ???? (supreme mango pancake w/sundae) 4.99 good portion. I had a bite of this from my friend, yum! 

Would recommend all of them especially the pearl delight! The coconut milk was creamy, pearl was cooked just right and the sago fitted well with the dessert. I ordered that twice out of the three times I went along with popcorn chicken on rice. I was hungry okay!

Overall, I think this place is worth trying due to proximity. No need to come a long way for this though. Compare to other Chinese dessert places like Dessert kitchen and double Ming dessert  Dessert guru is just average tasting and priced a little more (like $0.50-$1 more)"}
{"text":"I got the durian pancake delivered but I'm quite disappointed just as I was disappointed at most of their other food, the servings are way too small in my opinion. For this pancake the inside is barely filled with barely whipped cream, it's so empty.    Along with that I also got pop corn chicken which was okay, their milk teas too watery, cumin beef and green pepper on rice was the most  disappointing, there wasn't a single piece of green pepper. Hong Kong style rice roll tasted okay but it wasn't a hk sauce, it actually tasted more japanese. The only thing I was pretty satisfied with was their Taiwanese minced pork on rice."}
