{"text":"Pretty good tasting food based on the two dishes I've tried so far. Prices for some dishes are a bit higher than average but that seems to be the norm considering the location. I liked their version of yukhoe ($15). The raw beef was mixed with sesame seeds, green onions and raw garlic from what I could see with a soy based sauce and topped with a raw egg and surrounded by sprouts. It was accompanied with julienned pear and cucumber. There are multiple flavors with the raw garlic being fairly prominent. Compared to others I've had in the past this was maybe more on the salty than sweet side, which suits my preferences more. This appetizer could be shared. The sundubu jjigae / seafood soft tofu stew ($13) was very good. It had a good amount of seafood (shrimps, mussels, clams, squid) and a lot of tofu. The broth was also flavorful. Initially it was a bit spicy but that seemed to subside over time. It's probably one of my favorite dishes to eat when it's cold outside. It came with a bowl of purple rice with a couple of banchan vegetable sides. This place has nice decor and there are a lot of tables. It seems nicely suited for a date or a group outing.  https://www.facebook.com/restaurantpetitseoul"}
{"text":"En entrée le tartare de buf( yukhoe = solide)  et les dumplings ( ok) ainsi que la galette coréenne  (kimchi jeon = ok )   En plat principal, le porc frit ( tonkatsu = très bon , sauce a travailler ) et le tartare de saumon ( hoedubbap = excellent ) épicé .  Le tout à partagé  Service très bon! Mais, malheureusement une des serveuses parle seulement anglais et coréen.   Froid près des fenêtres. Je recommande!!  J'oubliais seulement bière et saké pour l'instant."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Korean restaurant! When I went I was pleasantly surprised by great jjamppong (when most restaurants put instant noodles and call it a day) and also really chic decor. The restaurant is run by a really nice Korean family and it's located in a cool area in Mile End. So great to finally see a Korean restaurant that reminds me of Seoul in terms of food, feel and experience!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, and honestly I plan to go back a few times. A great Korean place in this area would be wonderful.  We had the Bibimbap and the Pork Bone Soup, along with one order of banchan. The banchan coat $5, which is fine since the prices are low for the area, however the portion and number of banchan is low. I wish they had bean sprouts and tofu, which wouldn't actually cost them more, and it would feel like a better value. Both our mains were pretty great, but the kitchen was clearly overtaxed, and the mains came out 15 minutes from each other, including the banchan. The waitstaff was similarly disorganized and really frantic throughout the evening.  I love the diversity this restaurant adds to this part of Saint Laurent, so I'll keep going to see if they can improve both the service and the options. If they start serving beef soon tofu (not just seafood), I'll be a religious visitor."}
{"text":"Le Petit Seoul offers such a fun experience with the bibimbap! It's a rice bowl with meat (or tofu) and veggies, served in a super hot bowl that keeps the food hot until the very end of your meal. The most interesting things that happen while you eat are: the raw egg yolk they put on top cooks while you eat the food, and the rice at the bottom of the bowl gets crispy as it touches the bowl long enough. (Mind you, don't touch that bowl with your fingers!)  In addition of offering a different lunch experience, I have to say the staff was friendly, the price was good, and the service happened at a good pace. I want to go back to try their other menu items, like their ramen."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant, plats généreux. A+ pour la nourriture! Par contre, prévoyez beaucoup de temps quand vous allez y manger car le service n'est pas rapide. ;) j'y retournerais sans hésiter :) aussi, parlent peu français."}
{"text":"This place is such a nice discovery! The service is A1 ; the waiters were so nice, the food is very good and the ambiance gives a romantic vybe with the lighted candles in the middle of the tables. There's a lot to choose from and it's also very affordable. The soondubu jjigae, which is a spicy rather thick broth with sweet tofu and seafood comes with a bowl of purple rice and with a bit of kimchi as a side dish. Also, the chicken wings were very good. It was made like how I usually like them : crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Miammm. My only concern (and it's not even that big of a deal) is that the menu didn't have images so if you don't know much about korean food, it's a bit hard to know what you're getting. But all in all, it was great and I would most definitely go back again when my craving of korean food needs to be fulfilled."}
{"text":"My sister and I stumbled in here after the place we meant to go down the street was closed. Everything we had was fantastic and as authentic as it gets. The restaurant itself is beautiful and would be perfect for a date, and everything was incredibly affordable (all the mains are around $12-16). The staff was also incredibly kind and hospitable. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"On voulait manger coréen pendant cette période des Jeux Olympiques en Corée du Sud. On s'attendait à rien de ce nouveau restaurant en plein coeur Mile-End sur St-Laurent. Nous n'avions pas fait de réservations (penser à en faire une d'ailleurs), donc du coup, on a dû patienter un peu dans l'entrée, car la salle était remplie. On nous a proposé de s'asseoir au bar pendant qu'une table aller bientôt se libérer. On a bougé pour aller s'asseoir à la table de 2 enfin libérer après 5 minutes. La serveuse a pris notre commande, on a pris une entrée de kimchis (3$) qui venait avec une souper miso **les kimchis sont généralement gratuits et offert par la maison dans les autres restaurants à Montréal**, par la suite, j'ai pris un bulgogi jungsik (18$) et ma copine a pris un sundubu jjigae (13$). Le service s'est fait rapidement et environ 15 minutes plus tard on a reçus nos plats. C'était bon, mais sans plus pour nous deux, déjà vu mieux. C'était assez bruyant car victime de son succès, le restaurant était remplit (vendredi soir). Conclusion, service courtois, bouffe bof, vous allez sûrement trouver mieux ailleurs et moins cher pour du coréen (total avec taxes/service = 44,09$) au centre-ville. Il semble juste qu'il manquait un restaurant coréen dans cette zone du Mile-End et c'est correct comme ça, ça s'appelle l'offre et la demande, je laisse ça aux hipsters du coin ;)  3/5 visité en février 2018"}
{"text":"Par où commencer ce review??? J'ai adoré et détesté ma dernière visite chez Petit Séoul!!!   Je vais commencer avec le côté positif de ma soirée. Lorsqu' on rentre dans le restaurant, on a un peu de misère à croire que celui-ci est asiatique de part son décor bistro/moderne...et cela fait du bien et nous change du typique resto asiat.....sauf pour l'éclairage 100% non tamisé!!!!  On nous propose un menu assez varié et nous avons pu essayer les takoyaki (boulettes de pieuvres frites), les raviolis frits, les ailes de poulets extraaaaa spicy!!!! ainsi que le jeyuk (porc mariné épicé) en plat de résistance. Tout était bon et frais avec une très belle présentation, mais mon coup de coeur reste les ailes de poulet....Wow....savoureures, croustillantes et brûlante (j'adoore)...j'invite les palais doux à éviter celles-ci ou de les accompagner d'une bière très froide!!!  Maintenant... côté négatif!!! Le service était lent, désorganisé et très chaleureux! On voit que l'entreprise qui je crois est familiale était débordée par le nombre de clients! Ils étaient deux serveurs sur le plancher ce qui était peu suffisant mais le tout avec une gentillesse et un sourire!!! J'espère pour eux qu'ils trouveront une meilleure logistique à leur service puisque la visite en vaut vraiment la peine!!!!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend for the first time ever in a Korean Restaurant, and he absolutely loved the food. As a Korean, I would think $8 for only four dumplings is rather expensive, and the spicy Jeyuk was too sweet, but the dishes were displayed very well and knew how to please non-koreans. Overall, the service was good and the food was delicious.  I recommend the hot steamed bibimbob."}
{"text":"Great new little restaurant to discover. They opened a little over a month now and I believe is still trying to adapt. But first let me tell you about the food. DELICIOUS!!! It did not disappoint. Hubby and I shared two appetizers which were the takoyakis and the chicken wings (spicy of course). The takoyakis reminded me of those I had in Japan and the wings were crispy, moist and tender packed with flavours. He then had the jjamppong, a spicy seafood noodle soup. It was a big bowl that hubby finished! I had the dolsot bibimbap. It to be honest, it was a little small for the price. Compared to other Korean restaurants, it had less garnishes. But it was very good none the less. The down side is that we had to pay 5$ for banchan. At other restaurants, it would be offered free of charge with unlimited refills. The banchan portion here was tiny! The only drinks that they offer for now is beer and shochu. Pricy :(   Our drinks were more expensive then out meal itself. 71$ for five beers and a bottle of shochu. 56$ for the meal.  So now the down side. The service. Not that they were mean. The waitress and waiters were super nice and sweet. It's just that the service was extremely disorganized. They got our orders all wrong. It's a long story. I am sure they'll get better with time. As for me, I'll be returning (for sure) but will probably wait until they get their wine permit."}
