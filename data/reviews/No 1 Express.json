{"text":"OMG, Today I order shrimp fried rice with extra shrimp. It was horrible the rice taste old and the shrimp were not done."}
{"text":"A family owned take out or delivery with reasonably good food; part of the appeal is the excellent value."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese delivery restaurant I have ever come across!!! This doesn't even deserve one star!!! We ordered fried cheese sticks which were advertised as free. When we received the order, which was charged on our credit cards, they WROTE IN an extra charge. Not typed, HAND WRITTEN, because we were \"wrong.\" Not only did we receive the incorrect quantity, but we were incorrectly charged without notice. When we called the employees mocked us, passed us off many times, and responded rudely to our call. Bottom line is, never order from them!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent, standard Americanized Chinese food. Quick, reliable delivery."}
{"text":"I tried to order food and the person on the phone asked me if chow mein  was that noodle stuff....."}
{"text":"I loved the Chinese food I bought from this restaurant! They had really good costumer service. I had tried other restaurants before but I liked this restaurant the most. This restaurant served really good food. I ordered Dragon and phoenix and it was delicious. I would highly  recommend to eat at this restaurant. I will definitely order from this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"This is my go to for Chinese delivery. I love their wanton soup and general sous extra spicy. They usually have delivery at our house in 30 minutes and it's always really affordable!"}
{"text":"This  is my go to place for quick, cheap, delicious Chinese takeout. Food is always ready very quickly, delivery is very quick and tasty! You can order online, which I appreciate because I can order on the go easily! The dumplings are good, and so is the fried rice!"}
{"text":"I ordered War Sue Gai and boy was it a big mistake! What was worst was the customer service I received when I brought the food quality to their attention. I've ordered this before at other restaurants, and it was always pretty much prepared the same. When they delivered this, it had mushy old rice with no veggies, which they charged $1 more for fired rice, and mushy breaded pieces of \"chicken.\" It had a very flour-y gravy over it. It was so gross, that I drove up there with my receipt to complain. Instead of trying to come to a resolution, they told me they've been serving it that was since they opened, and basically to get lost. It's sad because I've been ordering from there for 11 years since I worked at Metropolitan Bank. However over the years, they've gone downhill, and I was shocked by their service. Their poor son who has been crawling on the dirty floor since he was an infant now answers the phone, and has no clue what he's doing. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I don't know why the rating is so low. It's a good price, quick and pretty good. I love the pepper steak and onion. The meat is really tender. Also LOVE the egg rolls. They are larger and flavorful. They also deliver!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical about ordering, I did delivery waited about 45 minutes, but mind you it's 9 degrees outside. I ordered shrimp egg foo young and it's really hard to find a good gravy. This food was sooo good it reminded me of Ho Wah on cedar rd but cheaper. I will definitely order again, plus I never write reviews but this meal was worth it. I gave 4 stars since they forgot one of the items I ordered. I called and they delivered it right away"}
{"text":"First of all, I am not a new bee in tasting Chinese food. I ate at five star fine dining Chinese restaurants. If you don't know about that, I don't blame you. Believe me. PF Chang is not one of them. Perhaps you have never been to S. Korea. Yes. Hard to find in U.S. Anyway, living a lifestyle of fast and furious, I have to know where I can grab good quality Chinese takeouts. Yes, I am talking about fast and furious Chines e take-me-out-of-here-cuz-I-am-satisfied type of food.   Very clean tasting Chinese food here. When I am in Beachwood or Warrensville hts area, this is my favorite stop!!!! This is what I call quality Chinese takeout and this is why I had to give Panda Express dirt poor rating. I say not all the \"Expresses\" are created equal..."}
{"text":"A friend of mine just ate here today and found flies in her fried rice this place needs to be closed down and boarded up Health department i hope your reading this post i am going to post the pictures for proof"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly delivery. The shrimp egg roll was perfectly cooked and not greasy.  The cashew chicken was good with fresh crisp veggies. I was hesitant to order based on the reviews, but now I have a new place to order from."}
{"text":"Went one time for carryout dinner. Tried to call, couldn't get through after multiple times so went there and ordered. There were 2 kids taking orders by phone when I walked in and they just stared at me while talking. Finally, someone else took my order. Took only about 15min for food to be ready. I ordered fried wontons and chicken fried rice. Honestly, probably one of the worst carryout chinese foods ever been to. Wontons were terrible, just not tasty at all. Chicken fried rice was so plain I could've made better. There are much better places than this."}
{"text":"Desperate for Chinese food, my partner and I gave this restaurant a try.  The adventure began with the woman taking our order. For the life of her, she could not get our phone number right. She must have had us repeat it 5 times before my partner finally became annoyed. A second woman then took the call and claimed the problem occurred because my partner gave them more than one phone number. What?  That didn't start us out on the right foot at all.  Still, we ordered for delivery.  Between the two of us we ordered ham fried rice, General Tso's chicken, pot stickers, and egg rolls.    Although we gave exacting directions for delivery, the delivery guy came to the wrong door. I don't know if that annoyed him, but he refused to look me in the eye for more than a second, wouldn't smile, and barely had anything to say to me. Oh, well.    I love pan fried pot stickers, and no one seems to make them the same way. I thought their pot stickers were pretty bad.They are small and unevenly cooked (some were very dark) with a very doughy texture. UGH.  The ham fried rice was similarly unpleasant. I don't know if any frying was done at all; it certainly was cooked all the way. The nutty texture was annoying.  I am usually not one to add soy sauce to anything, but this rice needed flavor and I was happy for the many packets they provided. My partner thought the General Tso's was fine. I thought it tasted all right; nothing to write home about.  I'm not inclined to order from this place again."}
