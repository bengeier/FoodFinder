{"text":"Used Justeat to get delivery from here.
WILL NOT ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN.
The food tastes average but there's hardly any meat in my souvlaki dinner.
I just paid $13.85 for rice, potatoes and four scrawny pieces of chicken. 
...
but the justeat driver was awesome."}
{"text":"The bar tender is a crabby lady, was there twice and she cut me off for nothing, think she had personal issues with me , not sure if it had to do with my looks or because I was too pleasant for this bar, Savannah is her name.I would never return to this place if it was the last place with booze on earth, ignorant and disrespectful bartender.Sad thing is I know 50% of her customers.Mostly bikers hang out and not very friendly ."}
{"text":"Super kind hearted a family run business, I love the idea of being able to order breakfast anytime of the day, and yes I do often from Pegasus, sometimes even the owner comes to drop off my food he's super kind, and the food is always made fresh and it is on the cheap.  Sometimes it's a tossup with other breakfast restaurants with ordering from them you sacrifice a high cost or low quality, with Pegasus I've never experienced a bad meal, the price is right the food is delicious, I enjoyed my breakfast sandwich and omelets but anything you order from their menu you cannot go wrong"}
{"text":"This is a no BS bar. With a well above average kitchen. If you are a fan of Arcade Fire or anything gluten free you will not feel comfortable so please go somewhere else. Draft beer is cheap and anything pork from the menu excels. Interesting characters and sassy staff populate Pegasus. Dive bar feel but clean."}
