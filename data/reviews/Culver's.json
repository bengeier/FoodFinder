{"text":"The butter burger was cooked perfectly and juicy! The ice cream here is the best I've had! This location is very clean and staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"We've come here several times over a few years. It's always been clean (we go in the evenings). The service is great, they are all really nice, but not excessively chipper to the point of being fake. There's always so much to choose from, We always need a minute to decide ;)

Kids love the baskets and also the burgers, cheese curds and concrete mixers are their faves. I like the rueben, but it's so hearty, I can't finish it all at once. The dinners are a great value too, pot roast with salad and a roll, yuuuuummmmm!"}
{"text":"Culver's does have good fast food but beware of drivethru.  Back in May, part of our order was not put in bag.  Living thirty minutes away, I called and the manager promised to mail a coupon voucher, to replace items not received.  This was in April.  To date, have not received.  Multiple emails unanswered.  #customerservicefail"}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had at Culver's. In addition to being charged for my second item in my concrete mixer. I got to hear the staff talk back to the manager, telling them not to talk down to them, and that if there were things to do they would be doing it. 

The employee taking the order (who was obviously a trainee) didn't mark my mixer as a \"later\" order as I asked. So my mixer arrived before my food. The employee said \"here's your custard\" slammed it on the table and walked away quickly. About two minutes later the rest of my order arrived. I explained to the trainee my custard was supposed to be later. He took it and said \"sorry, we'll throw it away and make a new one when you're ready.\" 

Once I finished my order I went back to the counter with my receipt and asked for my custard. The manager gave me a new number and marked it on the receipt and told it would be right out. I heard her tell them it needed to be made. Sat waiting for 10 minutes before I walked back up to inquire where my order was. The employee behind the counter pawned it off on the employee working the custard area, \"he wants to know where his later custard is. He's been waiting for 10 mins.\" The trainee says \"no one told me.\" He looks at the receipt with the order and asked what kind it is again. Finally get my custard about three minutes later with a \"sorry, sir.\"

Oh and they are having a holiday sweepstakes that is not available to folks living in CA. Thanks for making me feel welcome! I don't need to eat here ever again."}
{"text":"Really good sundays on national sunday day for $2!  Can't beat that.  We liked the place, clean and kept that way with circulating staff in the dining room.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Closed! I drove by this location today (June 2014), and was sorry to see the building fenced off and the signs removed. Guess it's closed for good. Too bad, the cheese curds were yummy and the custard was delish!"}
{"text":"Tastes great going down, but watch out the next morning.  Don't know what they put in the custard, every time I have eaten it I get the runs.  Not talking the usual fast food gurgles but  \"oh no - I need to find a toilet ASAP\" runs.  Confirmed this with the other person in my house the last time we ate there this past weekend.  Too bad, because for fast food it tastes pretty decent."}
{"text":"I like this place! Try the kids meal even if your a adult like me. you get a burger, drink and side. I think their food is very good and the daily custard specials are excellent. The place is cleaner then most quick places. I think worth a try. From WI I believe and they seen to never go away. Food is made to order but remember still a hamburger joint."}
{"text":"We come here just about every day. I have had everything from the wonderful butter burgers,the chili dogs,chicken strips,salad, and every single one of there tasty sides. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Culvers and i loved it. The food is fresh and the restaurant is clean. The staff is very friendly and on top if everything as well. I would return :)"}
{"text":"Culver's is a family favorite!  The cheese curds are like no other & the food tastes fresh!  My favorite is the fried chicken & mashed potatoes, although I ALWAYS have to wait nearly 20 minutes it is fresh. Not exactly sure why they don't keep more available but it's worth the wait (even if they get irritated for making me wait). As if I'm the only one who ever orders chicken??  The custard is yummy & I like that they do a flavor of the day. Usually pretty tastes."}
{"text":"I am. From Texas and had never heard of this place.  My babysitter told me to go in and try out their ice cream  so I brought my daughter. The Burger was delicious!  My daughter loved their chicken strips and the ice cream was TO DIE FOR!"}
{"text":"We visit this Culver's once a week and drive a good distance just to eat here, it's really that good. We pass In N Out and Habits along the way. 

Chicken tenders, butterburgers, fish, cheese curds and custard are just a few of our favorites. 
Snack Pak full sized cheeseburger with everything, sm soda and sm fries for 4something. 
My kids get a choice of entree, sm fries, sm drink and custard for only $5andchange (the custard alone is $2 so it's a great deal). If your kids are too full save the custard coupon for a rainy day or an afternoon snack. On the kid's meal bag is a token, save 10 and get a free kids meal or shirt or toy.

If you do the survey on the receipt you get a free custard (again $2). We haven't had to purchase a custard in 2 years. Sign up for their email club and get a free basket meal of your choice (fish, burger, chicken, shrimp), get free custard on your birthday (and you can add your family members too).  Email periodically sends coupons for free items or buy 1 get 1, and also a few easy games or contests a year and winning odds are really good. Just today in the grocery ad mailer pak on the back of the newspaper ad there was a buy 1 basket get 1 free.

On top of all this, the employees are awesome and helpful, like I said, we drive a pretty good deal to eat here because the food is so good and the employees are so friendly. If you ever have a problem talk to them, they will help you immediately."}
{"text":"The workers at this culver's were sooo nice! I had car troubles in the street in front of their building and while I waited for someone to come help, the workers offered me free ice cream and water. They were extremely friendly, nice, and understanding and it made me feel so much better after my crappy situation"}
{"text":"We have been to Culvers twice now. BOTH times we used the drive thru and BOTH times our order was messed up. We will not go back. The burgers are delicious, but it is not worth the agravation of waiting and waiting for an order that isn't right. The employees don't care either. You'll get a blank stare and an \"oh well\" attitude."}
{"text":"Everything was great except for the burgers they are greasy and very charred compared to other stores."}
{"text":"Love the ice cream here. The food tastes okay, I just wish it wasn't so greasy! The parking lot can get packed. They kept the tables clean amd bathrooms clean too and that's always a plus. The staff is friendly and they'll offer suggestions if you're unsure of what to get. I'll probably be back, mainly for the ice cream :-)"}
{"text":"Well
Today was our fourth trip
And culvers knocked it out of the park
The burgers were fresh and hot and the fries were hot and crispy
Well done culvers!"}
{"text":"I grew up with Culver's for the past 25 years and am happy to finally get one only 1.5 hours away. I ate lunch here before going to Ikea and then had dessert right after Ikea. While the service wasn't as quick as Culver's in WI, I'm confident they will get faster. I could tell that the team members cared and were trying to be quick / doing everything they could do which is why I gave 5 stars...besides the TASTY food of course."}
{"text":"Glad they are here! Love the butter burgers and the custard is GREAT! Understand they plan on 3 more."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch and I was kind of in a hurry, despite how busy it was they got me in and out quickly...  And the food wasn't too bad either ;)"}
{"text":"Used Yelp to find this place for a quick bite. Wow! Burgers were awesome and the side order of beans delicious. A new favorite!"}
{"text":"Went for the frozen custard, pleasantly surprised. Drive through only, can't attest to the inside staff, but the drive through was efficient and friendly.  The italian ice is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Burgers  are getting greasier every time I stop.  Chicken is fine, friesare good and custard is great."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try out this place given all the positive reviews and hype.  But we were very disappointed.  The prices are a lot higher than you're led to believe.  And the food left a huge lump in my belly.  Wasn't feeling too good the rest of the night.  I think it was those fried cheese curds.  They were a party in my mouth going down but I paid for it later.  Didn't even get to try the ice cream because the bill for a family of 5 was already $50."}
{"text":"First time eating here.  Burger was fairly good, but the chili was NOT!  It was WAY to oily, bland, and slightly burned-tasting.  I'd be willing to try the chili again, and report back, but right now, my review stands."}
{"text":"Worst. Food. Ever. The most common words my three separate groups of friends and families have used to describe their visits here and the food at this place is \"disgusting\" and \"inedible.\" I could not take a third bite of the disgusting burger I was served at this place. Upside of not being able to finish a Culvers meal: I didn't get sick to my stomach!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Culver's in the valley. Today I stopped by to get ice cream. I didn't know I was going to be cussed at in the drive through. The food is not up to snuff compared to other Culver's and the employees are not the cheeriest. 

I'd rather drive to the Culver's at metro center than go here."}
{"text":"The food isn't too bad - but the service can be downright dreadful.  The front counter is just a mish mash of people all jockeying to be served.  There is no order to it and the cashiers seem helpless to make sense of it.

The custard is usually good, but tonight it had an awful chemical taste to it, like someone had not rinsed the soap or santizing solution from the machine before adding the custard base.  It was gross.  

Combined with the crappy attitude of the lead cashier when we had to bring back an improperly prepared food item, I think this may be our last visit.  Not good enough to warrant these many issues.

My favorite menu item has to be the salads, but I don't guess we'll be eating them going forward unless someone fixes these problems.

One more totally gross thing:  the bathrooms smelled like urine. And the do not provide paper towels, just an air dryer.  I was sick thinking about what might be on that handle..."}
{"text":"This is one northern invasion I'm pretty sure the south will welcome. Who can resist deep fried WI cheese curds, butter burgers and the yummiest custard I'm pretty sure in the whole world. 

The Turtle alone is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at Culvers with my family of 6.  The food is good, but the ice cream is outstanding.  Can't beat the kids meals with a free dish of ice cream!!!!"}
{"text":"OMGGG!!! Im not much on sweets but these guys have won me over with their single scoop frozen yogurt sundae with oreo and hot fudge. Thats the business! Ill be sure to go back for a taste of their burger and fries."}
{"text":"I only had ice cream, and the burgers either have to be delicious or terrible from the looks of them. Lots of friendly people working."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my experience tonight. Ordered a walleye sandwich basket with cheese curds and a walleye dinner with two sides to go. When I returned home there were no cheese curds plus there was only one side with the dinner. 
Double check all your orders."}
{"text":"This Culvers is always hit or miss. Sometimes the service is awesome and sometimes it it horrible. The food looks like they just throw it together literally. Onions are cut WAY too thick for burgers. Tomatoes look like they were from the day before. The only real highlight is the custard."}
{"text":"So my roommate is from Wisconsin - it is an endless source of good-natured teasing. She's been yappin' about taking me to this Culver's since October.

So like a good roommate, I went with her last night with a couple of our friends and I have to admit the ButterBurgers are much better than your average fast food joint fare. They also had a varied menu that included salads and chicken which was a nice surprise.

Best reason to go though - the custard. 

Good burgers but it's still no In N Out!"}
{"text":"I tried Culvers for the first time this week and loved it. It's a bit pricey but well worth it. I will surely becoming a regular at this place."}
{"text":"Good old Culver's - my first experience here was almost 20 years ago in Madison, Wisconsin - little did I know endless cheese curds and butter burgers would eventually invade Tempe, Arizona.  I remember driving past my first Culver's and wondering what a 'Frozen Custard Butter Burger' was and in larger sense wondering what was wrong with Wisconsin, only to find out I read the sign wrong - which is more of an Arizona educational issue... .. .  Sure, the curds don't squeak - but they're still pretty tasty and the concrete turtles are hard to beat."}
{"text":"Ok so Culver's isn't the healthiest option but for those days when you're craving a bit of ice cream (or cheese curds) this is the place to go. They have SO many choices for mixing in to your dessert. The food is always made to order and fresh. Service has always been friendly and fast. If you need an ice cream fix, try them out. You'll be glad you did :)"}
{"text":"I wouldn't would like to start this off by saying I really like the Culvers  food, although I would really like to know what goes on during the hiring process. Time after time I ask for something simple like a extra ketchup or ranch, and then I get asked how many ketchup a I want, and no 2 ketchups is certainly not enough for 4 meals. I honestly just baffles me that I have to pled my case just to get a few dipping sauces. This has happened way to many times for this to go unnoticed, I have had enough. I will not recommend this place to anyone. I also had to repeat my order at least 3 times because the employee that took my order was laughing and joking around with the other employees. And the lady at the window was drinking soda and was quite rude to me as I asked for a ketchup which made me very uncomfortable (I was very polite to her). I don't think I will be back to this location."}
{"text":"Worst culvers ever! I ordered a concrete mixer and there was a long string in it at the bottom. I went to the cashier to complain and the manager tells me the string got into the ice cream from a towel they were cleaning with!! Disgusting! I plan on calling corporate Monday morning!"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite Restaurant!!!  When it comes to burgers and fries, this joint is the greatest... A High quality product is what us as consumers  want and will pay for!!!"}
{"text":"Culver's was very, very good. The Butterburger was very good and well cooked. The fries were good, but their those type of fries that are only good with ketchup. I tried the Culver's root beer. It was very good! Like no root beer I have ever had before. The custard was very creamy! Delicious! I got the Andes concrete mixer with vanilla custard. It was really good! Culver's was amaz!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service - get order wrong, don't give condiments and argue.  Screwed up order - 2 other cars just drove away before ordering. Refused to give 1 ketchup for 3 orders of fries.   Overcharged me again"}
{"text":"There are two reasons Culvers stands out for me, they baste grill their meat patties  in butter.  The flavor this produces is exceptional and reminds me of a local diner I used to eat at when I was growing up. 

The second thing is that they serve real frozen custard. The texture and taste is far superior to frozen yogurt or soft serve ice cream.

The fries  are nothing special."}
{"text":"Bad service today. Two registers open. One cashier taking multiple orders from one customer. The other cashier let someone cut in front of me then decided she was done waiting on customers. With a line out the door there was no manager around. I left without ordering."}
{"text":"If you don't like Dairy Queen, just stop reading now... 



Are they gone now? 

OK, for the rest of us, Culver's is a family-friendly fast food joint, and their Butter Burger is pretty good. As other reviewers have mentioned, the burger is not the same as In-N-Out, but I get sick of the same old burger. I like some variety, and this is a good-tasting, fairly high quality burger. It's a bit unique because they butter the inside of the bun and press the beef patty until you get a slightly toasty outer edge on your patty. As for the sides, the cheese curds are not that great (A&W has better), but the onion rings are good. I haven't tried their crinkle cut fries yet, but I hear they're pretty good. Eh, from now on, I will just get a single Butter Burger and a small custard; that's more than enough food for one person!

I will probably visit Culver's every month or two just to try something new from their large menu. The service is VERY good and VERY friendly, the restaurant is clean, and there is a nice LCD where they show sports games. However, you shouldn't bother coming to Culver's unless you like ice cream. The custard tastes a lot like soft-serve ice cream, but thicker and richer. The different flavors of custard mixes are fun, but avoid the brownie bits (eww!). On the other hand, the turtle mix was really good with all those nice roasted pecans.

Give Culver's a shot. Just skip the sides and save PLENTY of room for dessert"}
{"text":"We went last night.10% of total revenue went to the school and it was PACKED, as expected because Sundance parents/grandparents are the best! Anyway, what was pleasantly surprising was the accommodating service!! We threw away our coupon on the bag for a free cup of ice cream but the server at the counter was willing to give one to us anyway!! We decided on a bigger size but still, she offered! Cleaning off the tables only to have another customer (us) patiently waiting yet still with a positive attitude and not stressed! Made for a wonderful experience for the grandkids PLUS they now like Culvers! (the promotion works Culvers!) It wouldn't have been a first choice to take the kids to, usually won out by McDonald's or BK because they have play areas, but they liked the buttered buns and the ice cream and all the burgers!! We will be back! Hope you decide to do another for Sundance :)"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I always want to eat their food. I crave it! The service is pleasant. The milkshakes, get the Oreo one suggested by me!"}
{"text":"Long wait, and bland burgers. Decided to check this places out after passing by it 12 dozen times. I was not really impressed with the service, the food, or the atmosphere. The prices were a bit on the high side for a fast food joint as well."}
{"text":"When you walk in to this newly built restaurant, the first thing besides the \"new building\" smell that you'll notice is the enormous menu. If this menu was a house, it'd be a mansion. If it was a boat, Bill Gates would own it. 

As you navigate the menu you'll find burgers, sandwiches, salads, sides, shakes, \"Concrete Mixers\", it screams America and Wisconsin in one breath. I ordered the Cheddar (Butter)Burger with Bacon (double of course) value basket with cheese curds. My order was taken quickly and efficiently, and while the place was busy (there were not many available parking spots) we were able to find a seat for 4 people without issue.

We waited a few minutes, but not too long (especially given how busy it was), to receive our food at our table.

If you remember nothing else from this review, CHEESE CURDS. ORDER THEM. Cheese curds, apply directly to the mouth. Cheese curds, apply directly to the mouth. Cheese curds, apply directly to the mouth. These little fried balls of joy exist to make people happy. It reminds one of cheese sticks but it straps it to a rocket and enters outer space, the final frontier of good taste. 

The burger was good, I didn't realize when I ordered that for that specific burger you have to ask for lettuce/tomato and other condiments (I'll keep that in mind for next time). It was a good sized burger, the patties were cooked in a way that reminded me of Steak 'n Shake. The bun was fresh. I get the feeling that the cheese is just the highlight of this restaurant. (Remember to order the cheese curds)

I thought the service was good, they have staff in the dining room to take your tray if you're done and deliver food to your table a la Chick-Fil-A. 

Overall, this is a good place with good food and good service (order the cheese curds)."}
{"text":"i stopped in this evening at the loathing thought of having to cook during finals week.  I decided to walk in so i could take my time looking at the menu.  I was greeted right away as i walked in, and my first thoughts were 'wow this place is really clean'.  I stepped up to the counter and Jacob was eager to help me pick out something, making several recommendations of items on the menu he liked.  I decided to go with the crispy chicken sandwich. When i got home and opened my box, i realized that this was the first time i had ever gotten fast food and what i ordered actually looked as good as the picture!  the taste did not let me down one bit either! overall, Culver's appears to be clean, staffed well with employees eager to help and give great service, and the food exceeds my expectations of what i would expect from a fast food joint.  I must say also that i have tried their custard on several different occasions from another location and they are fantastic! i am regretting not ordering a vanilla custard with oreos as i type this!"}
{"text":"Best salads and customer service!! I got the wrong salad at drive thru and manager was awesome and made sure I got the right one and some delish custard too ..what a nice surprise ..thank you very much!!! FROM SAN PALMAS APT GIRL..LOL"}
{"text":"Most Culver's are the same. I would say this location has amazing service and my order is always fresh/correct. If you have a choice, come to this Culver's!"}
{"text":"Most Culver's are the same. I have had mostly good experiences at this location...occasionally it can get very busy and take a bit for food. My one complaint (minor as it is) is that they only have tea behind the counter; it would be great to have it at the beverage counter in the dining area so you do not have to wait in line to get a refill. Also they have some great specials, like $1 waffle cones or curds. They have a meeting room connected to the restaurant that is good if you have a large group,."}
{"text":"I really like their burgers.  They are buttery delicious.  Also, their rootbeer is yummy!  And of course the custard.  Just wish they fries were a little different and I wish restaurants would take out the TV's or just have one area so families can visit."}
{"text":"Very greasy, for a place with a drive thru, it's kind of pricey.
I felt sick after l ate there, so I won't return."}
{"text":"Culver's is a mix between fast food, family restaurant, and custard stand.  It looks homey from the outside, but inside you order at the front counter like any fast food joint.  They're famous for the Butter Burger, so Hon got a triple, and I got a double.  They were delicious!

They're called butter burgers because the buns are buttered and grilled, and that adds both fat and flavor!  The burgers are thin and they're seared, giving them caramelized crispy edges. like an old fashioned diner burger.  The fries were good, too.  Not thin and greasy, like most fast food.  Everything was cooked to order and came out fresh, delivered to our table by the wait staff.

Culver's is also known for it's custard.  We finished with Concrete Mixers, frozen custard with candy or fruit add-ins.  I got vanilla custard with Oreo.  Standard combo, but the flavor was great.

Overall, it was a good experience, and I'd definitely go back again.  I'd like to try some other things on their menu, but I don't know if I can resist  those burgers!  This isn't the place to choose if you're trying to be health-conscious, but for an occasional indulgence it hits the spot!"}
{"text":"very good restaurant and also good milkshakes and ice cream. i used to go to the culvers  in South carolina and the burgers are good. I'll be definitely coming back  to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Having moved here from NJ where there is no Culver's, I only recently discovered Culver's. We REALLY love e concrete mixers. The ice cream is very good. The place is always very, very clean. Probably cleaner than my kitchen. Employees are always friendly, nice and helpful. Appreciate it that they offer more than hamburgers and breaded chicken sandwiches. The fish bun was exceptionally good. TVs like a sports bar was a nice touch. Much better than Mc Donalds or Burger King."}
{"text":"Culvers is a great place! They have a large menu to please just about any one. I often suggest Culvers when I am trying to think of a place that will please almost any one. They have kids meals and old fashion dinners with items like pot roast and mashed potatoes. Culvers has nice salads also.The fries are not very good, better off with mashed potatoes, cheese curds or onion rings. 
The custard is alway yummy, maybe a bit too sweet but good. The fruit freezes are good. Overall, a nice place to get a low cost meal."}
{"text":"I have only ever been to this Culvers and I come at least once a week.  Never has my order ever been wrong except for tonight. After repeating it twice what I'd like on my burger I get home to find only the entirely different burger in my bag. I come to Culvers for the made to order freshness and tonight I got a burger with everything BUT what I specifically told them I wanted on it. After driving back and telling them I wanted what was on the receipt (because that was correct) they questioned me what was on my burger.. Obviously some new employees training went way wrong. Im disappointed this experience was so awful and un apologetic."}
{"text":"Still the best Culver's in my opinion.  
I don't think I've ever waited too long for an order here, and out of the about 100-200 times I've ordered something from this particular Culver's I've maybe had 2 or 3 minuscule mistakes."}
{"text":"The food is good not too many mess ups . Been many times and the staff is nice. The food is hot and the ice cream is good. The place is fairly nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my 2 teen sisters here a couple weeks ago & maybe my expectations were too high after reading all the great reviews, but I thought this place was seriously over-rated. 

The food and service were just average, comparable to most other burger joints. We got burgers, chicken tenders, and onion rings. I prefer the onion rings at Sonic to Culver's. We also got the \"concrete mixers\" for dessert and again, very average. I will say I was impressed by the nice women's restroom :D"}
{"text":"Great place to get a burger. Double butter burger is my favorite, but this particular Culver's seems to have the best pork tenderloin sandwich. The staff is always nice of course. I'm not an ice cream person but I would occasionally enjoy their turtle. Why would you ever want to go to Mcdonalds or other fastfood places if you have Culver's?"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The custards are great, love the burgers, just tried the \"Shaved Prime Rib Sandwich\" and loved it! I have only been a handful of times but I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Don't eat here unless you want food poisoning. I got a burger here today and now I feel awful."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Great variety and quality of good for a reasonable price.  Delicious custard and other comfort food are a big draw for us."}
{"text":"A classic old time burger joint with it's own distinct flair.  Butter burgers set them apart from all others.  Exceptional creamary for sweet treats!"}
{"text":"Their custard is amazing!! I usually get the vanilla with strawberries and bananas for toppings.
I tried their buffalo chicken for the first time and liked it. Crispy and spicy. 
Their butter buns are soft and delicious.
Love this place, must stop in whenever I come into town.

Service: amazing. Everyone is always extremely friendly and warm."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Had the pot roast sandwich value basket. Delicious! Great food for a reasonable price. Don't forget to try the custard. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I guess extra ketchup means put no condiments of any kind at all in the bag of lukewarm food? Thanks for nothing! Wonder where my honey mustard and salad dressing are?"}
{"text":"This is the rudest place I have ever been to (by a manager and maybe an older cook guy). About a month ago my daughter went through the drive through.  She asked for cheese & mayo on our chicken sandwiches.  When she got home and we got ready to eat, there was no cheese or mayo, just a dry plain chicken sandwich.  I called and told them, the guy (I forgot his name) said he would put me on the list for 2 free chicken sandwiches when we went in again. We went there last night and we were not on the list for free sandwiches.  I asked to talk to the manager and the lady who told me we weren't on the list was the manager.  I said I can give you the date if that will help and she rudely said it wouldn't help because I'm not on the list.  She then has some guy (I think the cook) come right up in my face and tell me I'm not on the list and he's not giving me free food and then rudely said have a nice day and walked off before I could respond.  I then said I want the owner's name and she said they don't give that out.  Next thing I know she walks out and I start to say something and she said Josh (I think that was his name) said to give it to me.  So she walks over to where they get food from the window.  I asked the cashier if she or somebody was going to help me because I wanted to order other stuff.  So he looks at her and she rudely said your free sandwiches are coming.  I said well we wanted cheese and mayo on them and she huffs and tells the cook and he loudly and rudely says NO, they are just getting the sandwiches like Josh said.  I said we wanted to order other food also and she rudely said \"for free???\".  I said no we were going to pay for the other stuff, OMG.  She mocks me and says OMG.  I just left without getting the dry chicken sandwiches.  This place is HORRIBLE.  I have never seen managers or employees be so rude to a customer.  They messed up my order and I paid for something I didn't get and then they lie and say I can have free sandwiches to make up for it but don't give it to you and treat you like the scum of the earth.  I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN and I will make sure everybody knows how horrible they are.  I wish I could put zero stars, they don't even deserve that."}
{"text":"Culvers has the best burgers out of any fast food chain in the valley. Love their fried chicken too. mmmm!  A+ service everytime."}
{"text":"I love the cheese curds here!!! But that's about it..

I definitely like the country club location better..

This location:
-clean and seems organized
-burger was flavorless 
-my concrete mixer had wayyy too many pumps of syrup
- staff was rude, unhelpful,  and not attentive ( I walked up to the counter and the girls continued to joke and laugh with each other and did not even pay attention to my order)

I definitely won't be coming back to this location, even though it is 3 mins away!!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty much just like every other Culver's that I've ever been to.  It's a chain, it has to be that way, so I don't really care.  The cheese curds are good in theory but their deep-fried heavenliness will vanquish your appetite pretty quickly, and then you won't be able to enjoy your greasy, cheesy, mayo-ey burger.  Venturing away from the french fries is generally not a good idea.

The pork tenderloin sandwich is godlike.  The tenderloin is about twice as big as the bun that it's served on.  I feel like this is my own little secret since I've never seen anybody else ordering or eating it.  Now the cat is out of the bag.

This place recently did a renovation with a bunch of fake stone veneers and trendy curvy decor all over the place.  Not bad, but I preferred the previous \"nursing home meets McDonalds\" vibe they had going.  They did manage to improve the layout slightly so that the soda dispenser is no longer right in the way of where people are waiting for their to-go orders.  It still gets pretty nuts at lunchtime though, so prepare to drive around the parking lot a few times looking for a place.

One personal complaint I have with this place is I keep seeing old high school classmates working there.  I pretend not to recognize them."}
{"text":"I knew nothing about Culvers until the TV commercials.  Then, I had to give 'em a try.
Like the ad says - delicious!
Well-prepared food.  Hot, fresh, delicious.
Began going through the drive through...
OOPS!
CONSISTENTLY,CULVERS GETS THE ORDER WRONG on something in the drive through!!
I've even called and complained and got coupons for two free baskets on my next visit!
To no avail.
It seems, even when they are not busy, they cannot get orders right.
Now, I know this is not Cordon Bleu food preparation, but c'mon!?
Asking for a cheddar butter burger, with lettuce, onion and A-1 sauce ONLY cannot be that difficult.
But, it's always wrong.  Either complete with tomato,mayo, etc.  Or minus the requested A-1 sauce!
Sigh.

Regardless, the frozen custard is always terrific! 
My advice, eat in only.  They bring you the food, and, if it's wrong, fix it.

This place would be damn near perfect if they sold beer!
Just don't drive through if you have any special requests!"}
{"text":"Super yum! Great food. Fast. Friendly service. Also they are employing our young people which I love to see."}
{"text":"4 Stars for the food and the company caring about quality more than other places.

-1 Star for them allowing a homeless guy to pester me and most likely others at a place where I am forced to park and wait for my food and I can't leave if I want my money's worth. They are also lucky I don't -1 more Star for the girl working there at the moment I am writing this review. She was very short and rude and annoying. She was literally mad at me from the minute I drove up to the speaker because I wanted to take a moment to look at the menu which I am still not familiar with (and ask my wife on the phone what we should get). Then she was even more mad at me for asking for honey mustard at the window. I felt very happy to hand over $20 (which I never spend on restaurants anywhere) to receive this treatment from a place that is trying to be more dignified fast food. I expect this treatment at a lame joint, but this is supposed to be Culver's.

Also, I don't care for the chocolate custard/ice cream whatever they call it. It tastes like Wendy's frosty. That's lame.

Other than that it is a place with decent burgers and the toppings/mix-ins cover up the cheap ice cream well enough to get it more than once.

***UPDATE***

-3 Stars for food poisoning to top off the experience. I regret going, and wish I had ordered pizza (which is saying something)."}
{"text":"For what I got I've experienced better. 

The bacon double had a weird taste, I think it was the bacon. Taste like it just got finished burning in grease. The buns are soft and buttery, but the condiments they put on there taste awful. The ketchup and mayo almost made me throw up. 

I love cheese, so their cheese curds are GREAT! 

The Rasberry cheesecake milkshake was nothing special. I thought it would have pieces of cheese cake in it, but nope!"}
{"text":"Hands down delicious! I went in for my first time on Sunday, I got the original burger with the limited pumpkin I've cream. The ice cream melts fast so I would recommend eating it in your car. Other then that it's a great family joint, I wouldn't hesitate in bringing my niece along to enjoy a nice meal!"}
{"text":"If it is a quick burger you are looking for go to Culver's. Plain and simple. Have you ever noticed that very few burger joints have meat that actually taste's like anything anymore? That is because many places now use pre-cooked patties that just get warmed up and slapped on the bun. Sure, not much chance for sickness due to under-cooking but at what cost? Culver's meat patties are very thin and very flavorful. Very similar to a Zip's burger if you have ever had one of those :)  DELISH!"}
{"text":"The decadent bacon cheeseburger is two steps above the fast food competition. And the tasty fries have a unique cut that you don't always see. The owner appears to be present and friendly.

However, there is a consistent offensive odor upon entering the small front foyer that is halfway between sour milk and a dumpster in July.  It could choke a horse, and I have never encountered it in another restaurant.

Please assure us that is not intended as part of the old-time appeal of Culvers."}
{"text":"Change is coming to Arizona.

After years of being written off as a red state, a new challenger had emerged from the Midwest with the hope of turning us blue. In a challenging economy, the naysayers wonder if they will get very far. Others have ignored them as a bunch of hype, providing no hope to Arizonans and their diet. And by now, many Yelp Elite members have all but counted them out.

But the people at Culver's have a different idea.

They realized this race isn't about them or any other burger franchise in this state. It's about whether Arizona-at this defining moment-will continue down this same road of being dominated by Californian or Texas chains, or whether we will seize this opportunity to take the state down a different path--to forge a different culinary future for the dining scene we hold dear.

And yet, in spite of all the doubt and disappointment - or perhaps because of it - many have come to Culver's Mesa location out  in numbers that this country has never seen, and stood for change. It stands reassuring, a familiar in a strip mall laden with an uncertain future, physically incomplete and a harbinger of an age of economic insecurity. But wait in line or sit in the drive thru and you will see that everything is made to order. And for some this means you will have to wait, and wonder if your window of opportunity is passing you by. But then a friendly face walks up to you and hands you what you have been waiting for.

Culver's faces an opponent, In-N-Out, who arrived in California nearly eight years ago as a fast food hero, and earned an admirable reputation for a simple menu and independence from the franchise model.

Yet the one thing that In-N-Out doesn't represent is change. 

Change is mixing ground sirloin and ground chuck into a single, uniform taste. Change is coating the bun in butter and then toasting it. Change is serving a burger where you taste this more than the sauce.

Change is offering different sides than just French fries. Change is allowing combos not just with salads or even mashed potatotes but Dairyland Cheese Curds. That is the legacy of earlier progressives like Bob LaFollete and Hiram Johnson.

Change is promoting your desserts just as much as your burgers. And change is being willing to eschew the safety of ice cream and the novelty of frozen yogurt for the consistency of custard. 

That is what change is. 

That is the choice this fall in Arizona.

The same question that first led us to Yelp a year ago months ago is the one that has brought us back here.  it is the one we will debate from Anthem to Maricopa, from the East Valley to the West Valley- the question of whether this state, at this moment, will keep doing what we've been doing, or whether we will take that different path. It is more of the same versus change. It is the past versus the future. It has been asked and answered by generations before us, and now it is our turn to choose."}
{"text":"Man o man these burgers are pretty bomb they r melt in your mouth delicious the bacon cheddar burger .... the cheddar gives it that special lil kick just gotta try it to knw wat I'm talkin about"}
{"text":"It is hard to find a place that serves Pepsi rather than Coke.  That's great!
Fries are crisp, fat and good.
Butter Burger, fries and soda for 3.99!  Awesome!
Next time I will try the kids meal and get a custard with it!
Tables were clean,  employees were courteous and smiled.
No issues for us!"}
{"text":"When I ordered at the drive thru, the lady working the drive thru speaker messed up the order multiple times. Also, the drive thru did not have a digital box that showed your order and that amount that was due, which caused more confusion on top of the lady who kept screwing up the order. After 5 MINUTES, the lady finally got the order correct. 
     The food was good, but the drive through experience is what made this review at 2 star one."}
{"text":"After 10 years, I finally have my Butterburger fix. As good as I remembered it being in Madison, WI. That wonderfully beefy and nicely toothsome hand-formed patty. In-and-Out has nothing on you. DQ? Not even in its league... Culver's frozen custard is good, the cheese curds are as described... but the Butterburgers?? Out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from me.  I went through the drive thru and grabbed a burger a couple months ago after reading they were good here.... not impressed at all, I would have rather eaten burger king to be honest and that's not saying much.

My second attempt was yesterday... decided to give  them another try after looking at their menu online. Saw the had an atlantic cod fish sandwich.... I'm a huge fish sandwich fan and I figured they couldn't mess that up..... I was VERY WRONG. 

I ordered the fish sandwich and onion rings through the drive thru. Got home ate a few onion rings, they were good but nothing to get excited about.   Then I tried the sandwich.... it was aweful.  Granted I will eat almost anything and I was starving.  I tried another bite and still horrible... confusing since I could tell it was actually fresh cod.. big chunks of flaky fish under the fried crust.  I'm not lying here, I spit the second bite out and trashed the sandwich.  Spent the next three hours with an overall uneasiness in my stomach.

9 bucks for a side of onion rings and a literally uneadible sandwich...thanks Culvers."}
{"text":"My husband was raised in Wisconsin so Culver's  has always been a place we make sure we go to when we go back for a visit. This southern culvers didn't disappoint us. The butter burgers are delicious and the onion rings are my favorite. Root beer is a very popular drink in Wisconsin and you will know why once you taste the root beer at Culver's. I forgot to mention how delicious their custard is. They have a flavor of the day into schedule showing the flavors for the whole month."}
{"text":"I used to make business trips to Kansas City where there was a Culvers next door to the shop I was at. We never once went to Culvers in KC on the advice of locals, but a couple years later this one shows up next to my home office in Phoenix. I tried it. I think I had a butter burger with a salad. It was nasty. The burger was basically a salted version of the junk you scrape off your grill after cooking meat. Also had a shake here once, it was ok.

I guess this will appeal to some though because the burgers do have butter and a uniquely crispy, salty flavor. And who doesn't love frozen custard?"}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give one star if I had a choice.  My wife and I went there to eat and take home a meal.  Regarding the meal we ate at the restaurant, we had to tell the server that there were items that we had ordered and they hadn't delivered.  Things like salad dressing and coleslaw.  The takeout meal we ordered was pot roast.  We asked that they not put gravy on it but put the gravy on the side.  They put gravy on the meal anyway and delivered a cup of gravy with our eat in meal that needed a cover.  When we got home we discovered there was no meat in the pot roast meal.  They had forgotten to put the pot roast in.  I emailed the company with my comments.  I received no response from them.  Apparently their \"customer service\" is not too concerned with keeping customers happy."}
{"text":"It's really great food but every time I come here it's packed with snow birdsI can't stand the snowbirds get the heck out of there"}
{"text":"I Love Culvers but I won't be back to this location. They are skimping on everything. I had to look for the second patty on the double burger, they only sell a med concrete and charge what other Culver locations charge for a large, and they won't take punch cards from their loyal customers. I was very excited to have a location closer to me and I've been here three times since they opened. Keep driving. This franchise is not good. I'll go back to the Culvers at the 303 & Bell. They do punch cards, put two full patties on this burgers and sell Large concretes for the same price as this location charges for a medium. Go to Culvers but pick a different location."}
{"text":"Their food is ok for fast food but if I don't remind them for any sauce I order or ketchup they won't put it in my bag which was the case today, no sauce for my chicken tenders so had to eat them dry, I usually do drive thru, they need to make sure the customers get what they ask for."}
{"text":"First time at this particular Culvers and it was good. Had a butter burger with everything on it and a lemonade. Service was very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I've never heard of Culver's but I'm glad I found it!  They have great food...cooked to order.  They actually listen and cook the food how you tell them.  It's rare now days to get good customer service, but they have perfected it at this location.  They greet customers and have a great attitude.  The restaurant is clean; including the bathrooms.  All fast food restaurants need to go by Culver's and take notes."}
{"text":"This place is a complete joke. The only thing you can count on is that if you use their drive-thru then they will get your order wrong... and I mean EVERY time.  Despite the fact that I have gone as far as to email this complaint to the Culver's Corporate website, it has done nothing to change this shoddy performance. I have talked to the night manager as well.  It's as if it is some sort of a total joke to them.   If you must use their drive-thru then expect to check your order contents before you leave the premises.  Otherwise go to the McDonalds just up the road since they don't seem to ever have this issue."}
{"text":"So here's the deal, I'm making this short and sweet because I'm planning a return trip tonight before they close (more on that later).

As for the 5-star rating, it's due to two things, 1) outstanding frozen custard -- the orange creamsicle flavor of the day was outstanding, and we've been enjoying the fudge pecan on a regular basis -- and 2) the customer service is always friendly, and very informative.

As for the return trip, that's due to the discovery that Culver's has veggie patties (apparently there are quite a few vegetarians that work there - FYI the patties are vegetarian, but not vegan), and they allow you to customize your burger as you see fit with various buns.

Anyway, we're headed back for a veggie burger and will let you know what we find. In the interim, give it a try ... apparently there are several Culver's restaurants in the valley but this is the first in our neck of the woods."}
{"text":"This Culvers gives Culvers a bad name. Ive had excessively slow service, hair in my ice cream and burgers that resemble dog food and that's enough for me. Ive never quite seen a burger paddy so thin and greasy before in my life. You've  got to be desperate to eat there."}
{"text":"Been quite a long time but have eaten here a couple of times and was really good if you are craving a great burger.  Also, the custard is delicious.  Chicken strips for the Grandson, were not greasy at all.  Fries were good too. Try it when looking for a great burger.  Hear their fried chicken and fish sandwiches are great too!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, solid frozen deserts, but food is standard fast-food fare."}
{"text":"Sounds like many of the other reviewers have never been to a Culver's and were expecting a different restaurant. This place is great! The butter burgers are very flavorful and I would definitely recommend a double burger. Don't forget the cheese curds! Also join their email club for a 2 for 1 value meal. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I if you would like a lack luster meal then order the shrimp basket. We only eat here because my husband likes their burgers but I doubt we're going to anymore."}
{"text":"This place has been solid. Good fries, good burgers, good cheese curds and great concrete mixers! For me, fresh hot fries are an absolute must for any burger joint and these guys have not let me down yet. 

*edit

I upped the rating from 4 to 5 stars. These guys are really good and I can't stop going here. :)"}
{"text":"Loved it! Great burgers, kids loved them (and they are ridiculously picky eaters). Icecream was very good, like dairy queen, but way better. Was a tad pricey, but we had coupons."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and concrete mixers!   Cheaper than Five Guys and much better. Everyone should try it the next time they are thinking fast food. Also, try the cheese curds"}
{"text":"I take pride in the fact that Culver's is a consistent fast food joint in Wisco. I have always had excellent service and delicious food. That being said, I will NEVER go to this Culver's again. We first went on a Sunday evening. First of all, the person taking our order was a tad rude. When we went to get soda, we were nearly run over by a guy taking drive through orders trying to get himself soda. My boyfriend ordered the 2 piece cod dinner. The cod was $9.95 and had maybe a handful of soggy, under cooked fries and two tiny pieces of cod. I ordered a chicken tender snack pack with mashed potatoes. The potatoes looked like they had been sitting there all day and were a dark brown color. We were less than thrilled about our experience that day. The next day I decided to go against my better judgement and stop in to get a raspberry smoothie. What I received looked more like a raspberry cooler so I walked back in and questioned my order to which I was told it was the smoothie. Considering it looked like a cooler with a scant amount of custard on the bottom, I would have to disagree. I went to a different Culver's later that night and ordered the exact same thing and it looked COMPLETELY different (it looked like how it should look). Do yourself a favor, go to another Culver's. One that you will get great service and great food that it is known for."}
{"text":"Their concrete mixers are fabulous.  Get one every time I go into Verrado.  So happy they came, it is a long ride to Avondale Blvd."}
{"text":"On 4/14/17 I went to the Culver's drive through located in Buckeye Az (On Verrado Way). I ordered a Crispy Chicken Sandwich Basket and waited for about 8 mins before getting \"MY MEAL.\" The employee was very friendly and asked if I needed anything else. I told her that would be all, thanked her for her time and drove off. I made it all the way home (8 miles away) before opening the bag and realizing they gave me the wrong bag. Debated with my self if it was worth it to get back in the car and get the mistake fixed. Unfortunately, I did. When I arrived back to the Culver's I informed them of the mistake that was made and they seemed very eager to fit their mistake (never once did the manager apologize). All the manager would have had to say was sorry for their mistake and I would have felt better about this incident. So I waited, and waited more, before realizing that Its been a total of 33 mins that I've been waiting to get the food I paid for. I went back to the counter and asked for a refund. You could tell by the manager and the cooks reaction that they forgot to even start my order. Very unpleased with my visit at this Culver's."}
{"text":"I am glad you opened this location in Verrado, my Wife and  Sons appreciate the fact you are right down the road!!!"}
{"text":"First Yelp review ever so bear with me....

  I have been to this Culver's location 3 times now and for the most part every time was good.

  The first time I went to Culver's was on opening day for this location.  I had never heard of Culver's before so I figured I would try it.  They were crazy busy (expected on opening day) and much to my surprise the place was really clean and well stocked.  My only complaint on this trip is that they got my order wrong, they put mushrooms on my burger which I can't eat.  However they were quick to fix the order, gave me a new order of fires while I waited and a 10% off coupon for my next visit.  I was pleased with their service.

  Second time I went in place was spotless, well stocked and staffed and everything came out as ordered.  However, I am not a huge fan of the Chicken strips.  I'm kind of a chicken strip snob and these did not do well.  They were not the worst I've ever had but not good either.  I absolutely love their fries though.

  On visit number 3 everything was cooked to order, no mess ups with the food.  Place was spotless and well stocked as the previous times.

  Needless to say they have some really good burgers and fries at a decent price.  My meal today for a cheeseburger, fries and a drink was under $6.00.  I will definitely be a returning customer as long as the place stays clean and the service remains as good as it has been."}
{"text":"One of my favorite fast food places, they always have good food (never had a sub-par meal).  Employees are always friendly, and the restaurant has always been clean.   They did however forget to give me napkins in the drive thru **a need when trying to eat in your car, so that is the reason for the star drop"}
{"text":"The food was really bad and the cost was high. The custard was poor quality.  We didn't find any reason to recommend it or to stop there again. Not often a restaurant experience is that poor."}
{"text":"Culvers at 3 pm was quite an experience. The food turned out to be pretty okay which is an accomplishment jn the fast-food industry. The atmosphere was delightful with volume set right and the noise level was definitely bearable. The one thing i felt perturbed about was the service at the particular time, between the drive through and the customers inside there did not seem to be a rush and yet i still felt rushed by the lady at the register. Food for thought and then hopefully in my belly"}
{"text":"Darn good burger. Very tasty on a fresh bun.
Ice cream or yogurt some of the best anywhere."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I try not to eat too much fast food. (The high proportion of morbidly obese patrons at Culver's explains why.) this place is highly overrated, though. The burgers are only slightly better than Burger King and McD's, a situation the wider variety of sides makes up for only a little. Even the vaunted cheese curds are just meh: tasty for the first few but too greasy fried to feel good about finishing. The same applies for pretty much everything on the menu. There are cheap hamburgers worth the colestherol-induced food coma this place always provides, but this isn't. Try Lenny's Burgers or Two Hippies instead. They're both better and cheaper."}
{"text":"I decide to try out this place, it just opened. Service is great and my food was hot, fresh and delicious! The Ruben sandwich here is my favorite!"}
{"text":"One word: Butter burger!

The burger patties are grilled in butter, so you get this really sensational flavor out of it. My favorite is the bacon butter burger, with a side of fries and drink.

Fries are regular, nothing special about them.

They also serve other meals like fried chicken, fried cod, etc. So nice alternative if you are not in the mood for a burger.

Their dessert section is also pretty good, the concrete mixers are nice and creamy, not too sweet, and pretty reasonable price compared to other ice cream places like Cold Stone.

The setting is very much like a semi-restaurant style, with seating out in the patio or inside. They also have TVs for you to watch while eating there.

It seems that Culveers likes to open their locations at the more outskirt areas of town, such as Deer Valley, Cave creek Road near the Loop 101, and their east Mesa location. I hope they expand to more populous areas of Phoenix so that other folks can experience the beauty of the butter burger!!"}
{"text":"I love this place overall, but this review is not about their awesome food. 

The other week, I ordered a value basket drive-thru, and when they gave me my food, it was the wrong order. I was already hungry and upset. They apologized and the manager came out to me to express his apology as well. Not only did they give me my money back in cash, but they gave me a free value basket card!!!!! This is some serious customer service I tell you. I don't know the names of the people that helped me but that was so sweet of them. That will definitely keep me visiting them too! I swear, any other place that's drive-thru, you won't get this kind of customer service as Culver's. They do have some awesome burgers and cheese curds, those still keep me visiting their restaurant, either way."}
{"text":"My whole family went one afternoon and ate lunch. Basically the food was tasteless. I had the fish sandwich and fries. There was absolutely no flavor at all. My daughter and son-in-law got burgers, they said they were okay. I don't go out for \"okay\" meals."}
{"text":"Not great in food or in service. I came in way after lunch and they had 5 tables filled. Food was blah but service was awful and I even said hi to mgr and she said nothing. First time at a culvers and will probably be my last"}
{"text":"I almost gave them 1 star, but since they are new, and the shake was good, I raised them to 2 stars.  I have never been to Culvers before, and have seen more of them poping up, so I decided to give it a try.  I waited 25 mins in the DRIVE THROUGH.  I ordered a burger, cheeze curds, and a shake, once I finally got to the window they gave me my shake and asked if I could pull forward and wait for my food?  WTF??  I pulled forward and waited another 15 minutes for my food.  Then they got my order wrong - a hamburger with only ketchup isnt supposed to have cheeze on it.  The cheeze curds were not very good and didn't come with a dipping sauce again WTF?  This location is brand new and maybe they are still working out the kinks, but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"So I was grumpy! I had to replace a blown tire on a busy morning at a Discount Tire in Surprise AZ where I live..why wait there when I could go next door to Culver's right? The tire rep told me it was awful and he hasn't been there in two years even though he works right next to it, but I needed to know for myself.
     So first, I was welcomed by a lovely girl called Casey; whose last day will be today, and she guided me through the multiple options they had available. I settled on the 6 shrimps and one Atlantic cod, fries and coleslaw! I'll make this easy for everyone with a  1-10 scale okay?
Shrimps: 7
Cod: 6
Fries: 8
Coleslaw: 9
Root beer: 8
Tartar sauce: 6
Seafood sauce: 6
Customer Service: 15
     While I was finishing up my new experience, I was brought a free vanilla custard and then offered another custard sundae twenty minutes later....amazing place. They changed my grumpy, to giddy with kindness. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Every Wisconsin fatty loves a good butterburger, we all know that, but what sets this Culvers apart from the others is the fact that its hands down the best one in Madison, and maybe even Wisconsin. The food is always hot,fresh,well prepared,and served quickly and politely. The other thing is its cleanliness. Its restrooms are always very clean and smell good, and the tables are quickly bussed and wiped down to make room for the next customer. The floors are kept immaculate, and you will never see a mess on the floor or at the condiment station. I think this is because the owner takes great pride in his resteraunt, and is always there. I know this because I live close and eat here 3 times a week, and he's always there. Most of the staff has worked there for a long time as well, and are good at their job. This place is the blueprint of what a Culvers should be,and a shining star among the companys resteraunts."}
{"text":"Midwest at it's finest. First Culvers I have seen since leaving Iowa. Always good food."}
{"text":"We ordered food for my husband and I at the drive thru - they confirmed our order twice, once at the drive thru and again when they delivered the food.  We had stopped at this Culvers after Church on Sunday, 7/23 around 11:40 am.  When we arrived at home, we opened the bag and the items were not at all anything we ordered.  Clearly we received the wrong order.  We were bummed to say the least - so my husband said he would drive back (8.7 miles) and retrieve our correct order.  When my husband arrived, he told the person what happened and they prepared our correct meal - the person did not offer any type of compensation for this extreme inconvenience that was Culver's mistake.  The person was very robotic and my husband asked to speak with the Manager, and in fact this person was the Manager.  My husband was shocked - my husband is an executive in the hospitality industry. The Manager said this is the company's policy, no compensation of any sort.  Again my husband was shocked, and didn't even know how to respond.  When my husband arrived home, he told me the story - I thought this was odd behavior for a Manager and thought the Owners of this establishment should know so I called the next day to speak with one of the Owners.  Several days later I have never received a phone call back.  I called again to see if I could speak with an Owner and a female (Sara?) answered the phone on 7/25 at 10:34am and told me basically to buzz off and hung up.  WOW! I hope the Owners learn, through this review, about the behavior and service some of their employees give.   Needless to say, we will not be going back here, even though we enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I just happened to see the Culvers sign out of the corner of the corner of my eye on I-77 and I promptly freaked.  I'd only been one other time on a trip to WI; before that I'd never heard of them.  We ate lunch yesterday on our way back from a weekend getaway.  Service with a smile and delicious food - the burgers have that nice dark caramelized char on them from the butter, and I love the cheese curds.  Custard will have to wait another time as we were about to bust.  Can't wait to go again soon!"}
{"text":"Went in and had 2 separate orders. Told the girl I was placing 2 separate orders. She took the first one then tried to take the person behind me. Had to repeat myself that I had another order. Pictures on the board were not accurate for what they had. Both my orders were mixed and matched with each other. Will not go back and recommend you avoid going there."}
{"text":"Add this Culver's to the short (sadly) list of places where the service cannot get any friendlier. In this day and age it is refreshing to see businesses understand the importance of good customer service, and even nicer when they encourage great customer service. Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate a good crinkle-cut fry and thick vanilla malt, but it's the customer service that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Culver's and I have to admit it was the $1.49 for 20 lbs. of ice that drew me in. It was late, I needed ice, and flashing in my face was an option to get it without getting out of my car and grab some dinner on the way home without making two stops. The burger was tasty, not out of this world, but satisfying. I was super happy to discover the crinkle fries! I haven't had them in ages and they were great, not greasy at all. But the over the top, does it for me every time, factor as to whether or not I will revisit an establishment was the F A N T A S T I C service. Super polite, friendly, and seemed happy to be doing their job. Well done Culver's crew!"}
{"text":"My three trips here since they have opened can be summed up in two words, rude and untrained. Everytime I go to this location the staff seem extremely uninterested and treat customers like we are bothering them. They were not very welcoming when I approached to order. On top of that they seem like they have never been trained before. The food is great but don't expect any stellar service. The difference between this location and the Edgerton and Janesville locations are night and day. I love Culver's, have been to almost 10 different locations. This is is the only location i don't have great experiences at when I patronize. Lastly not that this really matters as much but the parking lot is a mess for this being a brand new location the parking lot is in terrible condition."}
{"text":"Food was cold and I waited in the drive thru for a while to get it. ..
$8.18 for 4 chicken tenders and a partially filled small bag of cold fries and a small-ish drink filled mostly with ice :( NOT WORTH THE PRICE 

Chicken sandwich was dry and overcooked and there was no mayonnaise or any sort of dressing on the bun I'm not sure if that's how it comes but it was way too dry. Also fries were cold and the bag was not full of Fries we each probably had about 12-15 french fries in each bag

$18 for two mediocre drive thru meals
Not impressed

*Cookies and cream  custard was good
Service was okay."}
{"text":"This is one of the better quality fast food restaurants. They bring your food to your table and they pick up your trash. I've never been to fast food joint that does that. Now on to the food. I ordered a chicken sandwich and it was delicious. The side salad seemed fresh and was a hit as well. I splurged on a shake and the only downside is that I ordered a short. YUM! I will visit here again and check out a burger."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!  I'm originally from Wisconsin and never had this problem at the locations up there.  The food here is ok...it's typical fast food/mass production.  But this place needs an employee house cleaning!  The older guy who works upfront is just rude, condescending, inflexible, and unprofessional!  Avoid this location!!!"}
{"text":"I really wish you didn't have to put a star because they don't deserve the one star. Talked to the Owner one word WOW I'm thinkin you might need to take some customer service classes!! this location is the worst in the valley"}
{"text":"The Culver's chain as a whole is a great fast food company.  However this particular franchise is sub-par compared to other locations.  Unfortunately this one is closest to my house, so if I have an occasional hankering for frozen custard this is the most convenient.  It is nice to have a not-so-great Culver's close by though since it keeps me from going there too often.  
What's wrong with this place?  Mostly the service...the incompetent service.  Every time I go there they mess up my order.  Let's see, there's the time I waited 15 minutes for a cup of coffee in the drive through, there's the time I ordered a chicken sandwich at the drive through and brought home a bacon cheese burger, there's the time I ordered a cookie dough caramel concrete mixer and I had to tell them how to make it, there's the time I ordered a small lemon ice and they over charged me and it took 3 people to figure out what the correct price was, there's the time I had a coupon and they didn't know how to apply the discount.  With all orders there are always a long wait, even if I am the only person in line and it's for a simple quick order.  When it comes to making corrections the people working there are not friendly.  Cross Plains is \"famous for  friendliness,\" but you'd never know it eating there.  If you find yourself on highway 14 and need to get \"Culverized,\" I suggest waiting till you get to Middleton or Spring Green and go to one of those Culver's."}
{"text":"Stopped there today and got a cod fish dinner to go. Slaw and fries were included. Fish was very good enjoyed the slaw, fries were just ok. Will definitely  return again."}
{"text":"Nice, clean location. Chocolate concrete mixer is to die for!  Nothing more can be said!"}
{"text":"stopped in on election day.   the staff was GREAT, food was YUMMY and served hot!   good choice."}
{"text":"I have never been to Culver's before. The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly. I can't have gluten and was happy to see they have a gluten free menu with a good amount of options. I chose the Cranberry Bacon with Grilled Chicken Salad. The grilled chicken was cooked perfectly and the salad was fresh and crisp. Next time I will try a burger with a gluten free bun, which they serve separately to help avoid cross contamination."}
{"text":"Love the grilled cheese basket (w fries), concrete chocolate shake.  Love the reycling in the restaurant.  Love the cheese butter burger (w onion rings).  People in WI are so nice.  Some of the tables were not cleaned yet, but it was after lunch rush, and there were plenty other to choose from.  It is the only midwest-fast-food type burger joint we eat at.  It is way better than fast food!"}
{"text":"Recycling in the restaurant.  Our favorites are concrete shakes, the new sweet potato fries, grilled cheese, and cheeseburger.  Very nice & friendly staff.  Food was brought out quick.  Clean tables & restrooms."}
{"text":"CHRISTINA WAS AMAZING!!! I never write reviews but I had to the second I got in my car to leave. Our experience was totally awesome and it's so rare to find outstanding costumer service these days. Thank you Christina for being so personable! Very obvious she knows her menu, too! We will be back! Tomorrow! ;)"}
{"text":"They make an AWESOME milkshake. I also had their onion rings and cheese curds, which were tasty!"}
{"text":"Honestly, if I was rating this place back in 2014 I would have given it 4 or 5 stars. The food was amazing then and my family loved to go there for their custard the most. We all loved getting the mix ins or flavors of the day. However, since around 2015 the quality has gone way, way down so we stopped going. We gave this place a lot of chances thinking they may have gotten an off day but it never got any better. Recently my brother got a mushroom burger that had mushrooms on it that crunched and crumbled like a potato chip which was really bad and now no matter what you ask for in your custard it will taste like straight plain vanilla. Want to add peanuts? It will be nothing but vanilla custard! Want to add Snickers? It will also be nothing but vanilla! Cool flavor of the day? No! Just more vanilla.  And if you bring it up they get really unfriendly.  Just not worth it, we are done with this place.

EDIT: I tried this place to see if it got better and I regret it!I purchased a burger with a medium shake and cheese curds and a rueben melt here. I was handed the wrong food and did not realize it until I got home. So, I went back and they agreed to remake my food and bring it out. I wasted even more time waiting for the food. When I got it I just drove home because how could you mess it up again? When I sat down to give my kid his melt I realized that they STILL didn't give me what I ordered. So I paid for a bunch of food that not only got screwed up once but twice and I didn't even get half my order. I love paying for food I didn't get! I want my money back but I know that won't happen.  NEVER GO HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Burger joint hands down is Culvers on southern. The food is amazing n the concrete mixer with oreos is to die for omg.!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Culver's location in the Middleton/Madison area. The service is speedy, and the employees are nice.
Everyone loves Culver's. Their butterburgers are amazing, and their custard is even more delicious. Even though I'm way past that stage, I always get a kid's meal - can't pass up that free scoop!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, reminds me of home in the midwest.  It's pricier but it's not \"fast food\""}
{"text":"High Quality food at a great price!

Not exactly the best choice if you are in a rush, but otherwise never let's you down always great food.

I ate here regularly until I started dieting and cooking for myself."}
{"text":"So their website advertised something and they didn't have it...ordered fries and no ketchup in order.i called and they wouldn't make the order correct. I won't go back"}
{"text":"If you shift your weight just right when sitting in a booth, the seat makes fart sounds. My 12 yo daughter was thoroughly amused.  Foods pretty good too."}
{"text":"Lunch choice for the work crew today. First time for me! I got some cheese curds that were amazing! Buffalo chicken tenders were definitely not for the wimpy! I found them to be quite spicy. To spicy for me. The butter burger though, was really yummy! To top all that off, $1 rootbeer float today!!"}
{"text":"Love the cheese curds instead of food, I was scared to order the frozen custard shake, but it was good."}
{"text":"I had a butter burger and fries. They were pretty tasty. I think better than regular fast food. 

I went through the drive through and staff was friendly and helpful. I got exactly what I wanted on my burger. 

For fast food, I thought it was pretty good. Much better than the usual suspects."}
{"text":"This place is great. They have great service and the frozen custard is very tasty. The only thing they need is a delivery service."}
{"text":"I visit Culver's at this location about once or twice a month, and usually get a single cheeseburger to go.  The employees are friendly, the service is great, and the interior (if I go in) is always clean.  

My rating here predominately reflects the chain's new \" Pepper Grinder Pub Burger\" which is getting a lot of TV promotion.  The commercials tout 'two burger patties, bacon, cheddar and Swiss cheese, and a peppercorn sauce.'  I couldn't resist trying it. 

I don't know what it is about Culver's, but their cheese is only visible on the outside of the bun.  When you open up the sandwich, there is no trace of it.  Either the cheese is so thin it \"evaporates\" during cooking, or maybe it has a high water content and converts to steam.  Anyway, for a burger with two cheeses - you cannot taste it unless you pull off a piece on the outside of the bun.  My Pub burger was so dry it was like chocking down a burger without cheese.  The same also applies to the \"peppercorn sauce\" - I could not see it or taste it, and that added to the dryness of the sandwich.  

Culver's is a little pricey (why I normally get a single cheeseburger), but the Pub burger is quite up there - ringing in at $5.69 and over $6.00 with tax.  I found it to be a big disappointment for the reasons above.  Culver's needs to remedy their 'disappearing cheese' and in the case of the Pub burger, not spray paint on the peppercorn sauce. It's a shame, the concept is good, but I won't buy this one again."}
{"text":"Wonderful!  My husband and I took a little adventure to try Culver's  and landed there smack dab in the middle of the lunch rush.  I liked the way an  employee greeted us at the door and helped get everyone settled in to a line to order.  This made the crazy rush move so quickly it was unbelievable.

While I enjoyed my butter burger it had nothing on the cheese curds and the marvelousness that is Culver's custard!  So smooth and creamy I told my husband we should go back for dinner. :)  I'm glad I don't work in one of the office buildings surrounding the restaurant or it'd be all over for me.

Yes, it is a chain but a chain worth visiting."}
{"text":"My first experience with Culver's was visiting the in-laws in Wisconsin. It was love ever since! Usually drove to the one in Mesa, but now I have one close to home! 

Bacon double cheeseburger with a side of fried cheese curds is AWESOME! The food is good here. The people are even \"midwestern\" nice and very helpful when you need to navigate the sometimes complex menu. Place is always clean and the icing on the cake is that they have sports on usually on one of the handful of large HD tvs. 

The frozen Custard is a family favorite! 5 Stars for the Custard!"}
{"text":"I'm glad they put this location here! It's a high end fast-food burger joint with great deserts."}
{"text":"I had never had frozen custard until Culver's came to town....but I am a convert!  It is so much creamier than ice cream, and when you add in some delicious mix-ins for one of their concrete mixers, it is like a Blizzard on steroids!  I love how they have different flavors of the day, so far I have tried the S'Mores (outstanding) and the Really Reese's (chocolate custard with Reese's - a chocolate lover's dream).  I have eaten the food a couple of times, the burgers are pretty good, but not quite an In N Out Burger.  I do like that the menu is quite big, try the cheese curds, something you don't see very often in AZ, but don't make a trip to Culver's without getting some custard!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of mid-western cooking. It has lots of butter. on everything - even the burgers. I enjoy their custard and cheese curds."}
{"text":"Husband and I both had a tenderloin sandwich. It tasted great while we were eating it but a half hour later and all night long we were both sick."}
{"text":"A winner! What was striking about this place was the service. They obviously strive to achieve what nearly every other fast food joint has forgotten - SMILE and (at least) appear that you're happy we chose this restaraunt. Culver's gets it!

The food unfortunately wasn't the high spot, but we did take it home and my onion rings were cold, fries were warm. The burgers were 'ok'. I had a mushroom swiss and well, barely found a mushroom.

I'll still go back, this time to eat in and see what it tastes like HOT."}
{"text":"The hubs & I have been coming here for a couple years now. We usually hit the drive thru. Always get the same thing, butterburgers w/fries/onion rings & a concrete mixer. The employees are always super friendly & always offer our doggy a treat. Definitely our go to spot when we're in the mood for burgers & frozen custard."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I came here for lunch. We just beat the lunch rush and was ready to order. The cashier was somewhat rude however she did get my order correct. There was a lot of space in the sitting area. I got my order pretty quick. Double patty mushroom & swiss burger with cheese curds. Food was bomb!!! Cashier lady was not.....I don't expect sunshine and rainbows but a smile does go a long way."}
{"text":"Great butterburgers, salads, cheese curds, Culver's brand root beer and check out the flavor of the day custard! Service is friendly & they bring your order to the table, which is nice, especially if you have little kids. The atmosphere is a bit cozier than most fast food places.

The location in front of Ikea is a bit tricky to get to. Coming down University from the East, go past Ikea Blvd and Zaxbys and turn in the Culver's driveway. From the West you have to hook a U-turn at the light and then go past Zaxbys, turning into the next driveway at Culver's. Otherwise you can take the scenic route down Ikea Blvd, make a U-turn and turn onto the road that runs behind the restaurants."}
{"text":"You have got to try the North Atlantic Cod sandwich at Culver's. I'm not a fish eater but this is really good. Nice and fluffy white texture and doesn't taste like fish. Can't get much better than that."}
{"text":"Super yummy cheese butter burgers! I love all the staff, they are always cheerful and some know you by name. It's a nice place for lunch and the ice cream.... SWEET BABY JESUS it is great! I love Culvers and constantly crave their yummy food."}
{"text":"Omg. Vacationing passed the area stopped here first time ever seeing a culvers. Didn't know what to expect. What an awesome delicious burger place. Shakes are great too. This is like a steak and shake on crack. And after researching they have these in North Carolina! Wth culvers advertise a little for Petes sake, I had to randomly drive passed this one in Wisconsin to realize heaven is right at my backdoor here in North Carolina as well."}
{"text":"Try the colbyjack burger. Greasy Yummy. Fries is ok."}
{"text":"Love the ice cream... We know it's not Blue Bell, but it's close"}
{"text":"Very overpriced. Asked for 1 ranch dressing and they charged me 40 cents for each of them. Ripoff"}
{"text":"We've been there twice in the last week. The fish and chips meal is really good an the ice cream is delicious. Great service as well! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The employee who took our order was very rude and disrespectful. She brought out our order and dropped it in my husbands lap and left, no thank you or have a nice night. I checked the order and my husbands burger was wrong he ordered a double and received a single. I took the burger back in and the same employee that brought the order out was standing there with a smug look on her face. I asked her if she was the once who brought the order out and she said yes and I told her our order was wrong then said \"she act like I work in the back\". I said I just want my order corrected. Another employee came to me and asked how I would like my burger and I explained, while he was telling the cooks in the back how to fix it, the employee who took my order said \"please please make it a double.\"  I then told her with the attitude she has, she will be there for the rest of her life.\" Again while all this is going on no one is telling the smart mouth employee to stop and apologize to me the \"customer\" At least I thought that is where customer service comes in. When my burger was done she put it in a bag, folded the bag very slowly and handed it me. I snatched the bag out of her hand and left. Culvers has great food but with this one employee acting this way my family and I will not be returning. I will let everyone I know this experience I had with this particular location. I hope her attitude changes and no other customer has to feel the way I felt."}
{"text":"The food is so good and unique. Yay for midwest food making it to AZ. The place is always busy and the food is always hot and fresh. Butter burgers can be greay but really fresh and delicious! Crinkle fries and fried cheese curds are the perfect side and don't forget frozen custard! Really any kind is great but my favorite is their turtle sudae. Love that more locations are finally opening!"}
{"text":"Culver's is the best fast food. By far. 
Its the only fast food that I actually consider a meal and don't completely hate myself after eating. Don't get me wrong, the fat and calorie content is outrageous, but it always tastes fresh and they offer a great variety.
Their fries are my favorite. I love their root beer. Their \"flavor of the day\" offerings are always yummy.
Oh, and the actual meals are great too! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place, super friendly service and awesome food/desserts! Their custard is worth the trip by itself but try the Culvers deluxe burger for sure."}
{"text":"Our first time at this establishment was good. The food was excellent and the staff was polite. My daughter and I did enjoy ourselves, and the shake goes home with me.."}
{"text":"The food was decent. They gave free ice cream with kids meal which made the kids happy.  Overall nice experience."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, the burger isn't my favorite but I do ENJOY the Wisconsin Cheese Curds. I hate ordering them because Curd is just a weird word to say, but I'm always happy I say the weird word, cuz they are worth it! 

The other unhealthy thing I love here are the shakes. They look and taste great! 

The people said \"hello, welcome to delicious\" as soon as I walked in and they yelled \"have a great day\" as I left. I just think if you were having a bad day, how could this greeting not cheer you up?"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The employees are helpful and courteous.  The food is amazing .  the custard is awesome.  Fill out the surveys on their receipts and get free custard.  you can also get free custard with the kids meals :)"}
{"text":"Yup, this location has closed.  I can't image why with a combination of poor quality food and a dirty interior.  But if you ever filled out a survey, or even directly contacted Culver's, you know they don't seem to care how their stores are or how the franchisees run them."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets so many raves for their food. Don't get me wrong...the frozen custard is delicious,  but the burgers, hot dogs and stuff are just average. We showed up with some friends who insisted we try the butterburgers. They tasted like Wendy's,  only about 3 times as expensive. The fries weren't bad, but, like everything else in our society, they were salted way too much. If the prices were closer to a regular fast food place I would give them a higher rating."}
{"text":"This is a fast food chain that knows how to produce a good products.  The stand behind what they have to offer.  Restaurant is generally clean. Staff is attentive to get your food to you fresh and hot. A rarity for fast found establishments"}
{"text":"Just another average fast food restaurant. Employees leaning on the counter talking while your custard is on the counter melting. Sonic is right across the street.

Went again, ordered the same thing. This time they had our custards ready and were delivering them to us before we sat down. Bump it up from
 2 stars to 4. Looks like there trying now."}
{"text":"This is 4 stars for a fast food place if that's what your looking for. Burgers good, upgraded sides (cheese curds, onion rings) also good. 
Frozen custard gets 5 stars, super smooth and creamy - beats Coldstone and most of the yogurt places. What the hey - skip the burger and have ice cream for lunch."}
{"text":"Exemplary for a fast food chain type. But what was really decadent was the chocolate shake! If you're craving a shake don't go anywhere else! Sooooo creamy in the best way. Burgers and fries were hot and very enjoyable. Average meal about $8.00."}
{"text":"Burgers are bland.  Cheese curds are great and so are the onion rings. This review is solely based on those three items."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Amateur management. Mediocre, overpriced food... I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"SO GREASY. SO GOOD. I love eating at this place because I feel like every bite of their food is in direct sacrilege to vegetarians and vegans. It just feels so good to eat whatever I want and live my life without people telling me what's good for me and what isn't. Like every time someone orders a burger there, a vegan collapses from protein deficiency. It's so satisfying. Anyway no offense intended to real vegans and vegetarians, you can do whatever. Yo want just like I can, but you know the kind of people I'm talking about. Like people who do crossfit. Not sure if you know anyone who does crossfit? Don't worry, they'll tell you. God these butter burgers are so delicious, but they really make you feel like you need to take a nap. Or a coma. No satire intended I really do love these burgers. God Bless America."}
{"text":"Was very excited to go to Culvers as I've been hearing about it for a few years now.  They opened up a location near me and I figured I would try it out on my way home at lunchtime.

I ordered a mushroom swiss burger with one patty, onion rings, and a strawberry shake from the drive through.

They give you a number and have you pull up to wait for your burger to be ready.  I got my bag of food and before driving off, decided to check to make sure it was right.  Alas, no onion rings just fries.  I shut my car off and walked all the way around the building to try to find the entrance as the door nearest the drive thru is for employees only.  

I go in and let them know that my order was not right.  I acknowledge that the receipt does say fries but tell them that I had ordered onion rings.  The 3 people at the counter look at me like I'm crazy and then one of them goes off to tell someone else who is in the back.  This young lady comes up to me and looks at my receipt and I again acknowledge that it says fries but tell her that I'm pretty sure I said onion rings.  She looks at me and pauses and then says, \"That's fine.  It will be $1.08\".  I'm slightly annoyed at this point because I'm not sure why this is taking so long.  I tell her that I do not have my wallet and that it is in the car because I just ran out of the car to get my order fixed.  She gives me a \"Don't know what to tell you\" look and says that it'll cost $1.08 for the onion rings because they cost more than the fries.  I'm beyond frustrated so I tell them that it's fine and I will just take these.  

I get home and the burger is so-so.  The cheese was smaller than the patty and there were hardly any mushrooms on it.  The fries were bland.  The strawberry shake wasn't bad but  not as thick as I like.  

So unfortunately, they lost a customer because of this frustrating customer service.  If they had a screen at the drive thru order stop OR if they even had the girl taking order REPEAT BACK the order this whole fiasco could have been avoided.  

And seriously, they should have just taken back the fries and given me the onion rings.  A bad burger I could have overlooked and probably would have returned to try something else.  But annoying customer service is hard to get past."}
{"text":"Loved it! Here's what I had: 
Culver's Butterburger Deluxe Double Basket (the burger, med fries, med drink), and a Mint Oreo Concrete Mixer.

The whole experience was awesome! The employees were very patient as this was my second time at Culver's (my first time was a few months ago) and was using coupons. The meal was ready before I was done filing up my drink. Quick service! I chose to get the mixer after the meal and that also came quick. It came to just under $20.

Clean store, quick service, superb customer service, awesome food, hot meal, delicious dessert; what more could anyone ask for?"}
{"text":"Great customer service.  This location is very knowledgeable about the menu and offer upgrades on items in a very professional manner.  There are, however, a couple items that need attention.  The Men's restroom was dirty for the store only being open less than an hour.  The windows in the dining area had fingerprints and were pretty dirty all around. The napkin holders looked like they had about a week's worth of sticky fingers on the slots.  I frequent this location and have seen it at higher standards.  Would be a five star review, but please standardize clean up a little more and I'd be happy to give it!"}
{"text":"I give this place a four because it's wonderful and all but it jut not AMAZING.  They have great food and great service.  And the employees are well trained! I would totally go back! Always is a greater experience every time!"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. Our order has been wrong over 5 times...we either do not get what we paid for, or we get a wrong ingredient put into our mixers. A manager there, a girl with glasses, seems clueless. We complained about not receiving food that we paid for and she looked at us like we were kids trying to steal from a business. She asked, \"So, you want a free fry?\" Excuse us? We paid for it, so yes, we want a fry. 

Been to better locations. This one has laughable \"management\" and too many employees who either perhaps go too fast or simply don't care about what they're doing. Come on guys, get this location in order please."}
{"text":"This is the best Culver's around because it is company owned (not franchised) and they use this store for training new managers, so everyone really knows their job and they are not miserable like most fast food employees.  And the food is almost always perfect."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd have to wait 15 minutes for a mixer and two sundaes. They had all the cars park so to appear fast at the drive thru."}
{"text":"Root beer float was sad !! One scoop of Ice cream  for ANY SIZE .. the guy told me 
asked if I could have a little more ice cream . I did order float not a root beer. 
They said no after 3 ppl handled it and walked around with it .. I was out side so that should tell you how uncomfortable that was .. 
And they still brought it out side the same way it when in .. 
So I won't ever return , and this was the first time I tried this franchise."}
{"text":"Very fresh tasting burgers that actually taste like hamburger.  Buns and cheese and other toppings are top grade, fries actually taste like they're made from potatoes.  Service is very friendly, seating is very comfortable (very cushy booth benches, I love that).  Smoothest most flavorful custard (ice cream) around!"}
{"text":"I'm from the Midwest, so when I heard that Culver's was coming to AZ I got very excited!!! This is a new location located in Surprise, AZ, and I recently had the chance to go inside and check out the new flat screen TVs and nice employees! The shakes and butter burgers are absolutely amazing. I've visited many times through the drive-thru and there is a little bit of a wait to get your food after you've ordered. Don't forget to check out the cheese curds...they are so yummy!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Not as good as expected, and it took a while. But not a bad choice. Similar to in and out I guess."}
{"text":"The food is great the price is high but the overall experience was good. I have never been here before so the experience was interesting to say the least."}
{"text":"Never again!!   We have been bombarded here in Phoenix with adds about Culver's  fish sandwich, and even though I have never eaten at this restaurant, the adds looked so good, I thought I would give it a try. For anyone who has eaten the horrible stuff at Long John Silvers, this one is just the same.  It was greasy beyond belief.  The lettuce was like slime and what they call cheese, I did not recognize as cheese. That's not the worst part, they actually charged me $5.35 with tax!    Yikes!  I want my money back!"}
{"text":"The food at Culver's in Tempe was delicious and the service was excellent.  But when I went to Culver's on 28th Drive in Phoenix, I was very disappointed in the food and the service.  There were only 2 cars ahead of me at the drive-up window, but I had to sit in line for about 10 minutes.  I ordered a single Butterburger, fries, and a chocolate milk shake (which is the same thing I ordered in Tempe).  The Butterburger had no taste, no flavor, and was kind of mushy.  The fries weren't crispy.  And the milkshake wasn't mixed enough (you could see swirls of unmixed chocolate syrup in it).  I'll never go to the Culver's on 28th Drive again."}
{"text":"I don't usually frequent fast food establishments, but sometimes a quick burger is just what I need and Culver's is the place I go!  There are a lot of trendy, high priced burger places in town but for a good quality, quick burger, you can't beat Culver's!  The place is exceptionally clean and the staff is always friendly with a gracious hello when you enter the door.  I love the buttered bun and the crinkle fries and of course the custard is to die for!  I used to be a big Wendy's fan for a burger on the run, but since I have discovered Culver's I am a definite convert!  Oh, and if you keep your receipt and go on line to write a review within 48 hours you get a nice treat in return....usually a free single serve custard on your next visit.  

Culver's won't win any food awards but it certainly hits the spot for a good, reasonably priced burger when you need one!"}
{"text":"Thanks for forgetting my hot fudge...very disappointed. I requested hot fudge in my concrete mixer, paid the fifty cents extra for it and then didn't have any."}
{"text":"DYNAMITE. Okay, maybe it's because I am not from Wisconsin, nor the Midwest for that matter, but I love this place. We mostly come here for frozen custard. If you catch them on a sunday that's offering, they have dollar waffle cones.... and they aren't messing around: they're big waffle cones and homemade. I love that this place is fresh and local but still a small midwest chain. In addition they have been increasing the gluten free options to offer buns for their burgers. Note to anyone outside of the midwest, the frozen custard is meh. I am usually a big vanilla ice cream fan, but because custard has more egg in it, go for the chocolate unless you get something mixed in or a topping on the vanilla. PS Staff is super friendly. They are young, prob high school college aged, but not rude, totally polite and helpful. Just very respectful clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I would give a score of 2.5 if that was an option.  I would say I have always had decent food at this location.  I am however disappointed that when you order a deluxe or similar burger, you have to tell them that you want tomato, lettuce, ect.  It seems to me that those should be included automatically unless the customer does not want them.  The employees do not consistently offer to add them to a burger.  It always seems busy when I stop there and feel rushed, therefore I sometimes forget that I need to ask for those basic burger ingredients."}
{"text":"I guess I'm used to Beef n Bun in San Diego as the shakes were good but not amazing like I was thought to think. The burger was good as I had the pepper grinder. Loved the bun. Cheese curds were alright. Would I come back..... Probably.. Would I go out of my way to come here over a place like in and out.. Nope.."}
{"text":"Clean, great menu.  Kids get frozen custard included with a kids meal which is a nice touch.

4 stars instead of 5 because the staff is not as friendly as other Culvers I have been at.  Maybe something to do with the location of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Personally, not my style. I would choose in n out or five guys over this ANY DAY and they are both down the street. It really is a little pricey...got two meals and it was $25.  
Oh and.....the fries. They are basically the frozen fries you get at the grocery store or the ones they give to you in grade school. 
I really wish they just included all the toppings, instead you have to choose the ones you want to add. Sodas were good if you like warm pepsi. 
Basically...disappointing. Hit the grocery store and fire up the grill instead."}
{"text":"Ambience: 5/5 (relaxing blue and white decor, always super clean, with quality tables and booths and televisions in the background, outdoor patio seating; it's a fast food burger chain, but it feels like a family diner, and that's a good thing) 

Food: 5/5 (ignorant chaps from the west coast will tell you that In-N-Out Burger is the best burger joint in the world; they are dead wrong; Culvers's butter burgers are made from the freshest beef, grilled to perfection with that oh-so-tasty char-grilled edges and a slice of Wisconsin cheese, topped with a toasted bun with a pickle on top; a burger simply cannot get any better; the other thing they are famous for is genuine, made-fresh-daily creamy frozen custard that simply is unparalleled; do yourself a favor and drive there right now, order a double butter cheeseburger with ketchup and nothing else, substitute cheese curds for fries, upgrade your drink to a frozen custard banana shake, and enjoy the best meal you will ever eat at fast food joint) 

Service: 5/5 (this is what fast food service should always be like; friendly staff who genuinely want you to enjoy your meal; efficient counter service in which they give you a number, cook your food fresh, made to order, and then bring it out to you; for fast food, Culver's has unparalleled service) 

Value: 5/5 (a little more expensive than other fast food joints, but it's still reasonably priced and the food is so much better than the competition that you are more than getting your money's worth) 

Verdict: there is no debate, Culver's is the best fast food restaurant in the country; they have the best burger (butter burger), the best side (cheese curds), the best dessert (frozen custard), and the best service; sorry to say it to all you In-N-Out fans, but Culver's owns In-N-Out in every category possible."}
{"text":"I love Culvers butter burgers and ice cream, however they often mess my order up.....unfortunately I live too far to be able to drive back to have burgers  fixed, very disappointing in that regards."}
{"text":"We had noticed Culver's popping up in Arizona and we gave them a try to see what they were about.  Unfortunately we were underwhelmed: almost all the tables were not wiped down, the fish sandwich had no sauce on it (had to ask for tartar sauce), and the Wisconsin patty melt was bland.  One last personal strike although this isn't about food but ambience; blaring country music is not my first choice.  Normally we give everything a second chance but why bother when there are so many good burger places out there?"}
{"text":"Went to this location a couple of weeks ago , I read the reviews and thought I'd be a good place to try. I'm not sure if it was just the day I went ,but I had a horrible experience.They got my order wrong TWICE! But I'm one to try to make due with it instead of causing confrontation. My daughters chicken was pink, I was afraid so I talked to the young lady at the register but she gave me attitude from the start. I asked to talk to the manager, she came out and was very defensive and told me i must have asked for it. How can somebody ask for pink chicken? I will not return! My advice is always check your food."}
{"text":"Ordered hamburger with veggies dry (no mayo or ketchup or mustard) with mashed potatoes and a small drink.  Service was great.  Young kids who noticed I was about to order within 1 minute.  The gangly white teenager guy elbowed the pretty asian girl and she took my order.  The no cheese/ mashed potato order seemed to confuse her as she had to reset the order three or four times.  For 5 dollars and change its a good deal.  I got unsweetened iced tea. The iced tea container had the cover not covering the tea.  Kinda like the open invitation for the uncouth to spit or flick a boogie in.  It was a little chalky but I like my iced tea tasting like leaves rather than like water or the metal container.  Adding a little ice took away the bitterness.  The burger was great.  The toppings were fresh.  I really do not like commercial mayo or ketchup or \"special sauce\" on my burgers.  I like the taste of burnt meat or charred burger better.  Anyways.  The mashed potatoes are always too hot to eat,  I spend about 5 min blowing and stirring to get the mashed potatoes to not burn my mouth.  Please Culvers FIX THIS!  I want to eat my food when it comes to me.  That is the definition of fast food.  Keep the temp of the mashed potatoes ( which is why I come ) within non burning temp.  The tables were dirty and there were crumbs on three tables I tried to sit at but I dont really care as long as the seats are comfy and I can eat off a tray or placemat.  While I was leaving the Culvers crew all yelled \"goodbye!\" \"Thank you!\"  Made me feel so good!! So thank you Culvers for making me feel welcomed and appreciated even though I had to blow like a van buren prostitute on the first of the month to eat my mashed potatoes with my delicious hamburger and drinking 2 cups of iced tea which was not horrible but I wonder if some mesa mormon teenager rebel spit in my tea.  Karma!  Treat food service with the highest respect!!"}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy. I come here often and usually get the tender basket because it's amazing. And lately my sister and I have been trying new things here. So today we had the culvers deluxe with everything on it, we got cheese curds too. We put cheese curds on the burger, but I really loved their burger."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap. 
I'm impressed by the quality of the ice cream, but I usually only get chocolate so I'm not sure about their flavors of the day. They use real fruit toppings though, as opposed to gross high fructose corn syrup concotions. 
They also use real meat in the burgers, and they're made to order. The freshness shows. They even use butter. real butter.
of course this place is from Wisconsin
that being said, I was disappointed by their fried cheese curds (they didn't even squeek), but only because they're from Wisco and should thus be able to execute them perfectly. 
oh well.
They get additional props for playing some sweet motown."}
{"text":"The managers in this location here are grumpy ( most of times very rude grumpy, always such as Nick). Customer Service doesn't exist in this Deer Valley location, if you would like to experience and see grumpy rude people, stop by! :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of culver's food. Everything that I've ever had has been super greasy and not very tasty. If I'm going to have a super greasy burger, I'll pick 5 guys or in&out everytime over these guys. However, the turtle custard desert is to die for. So it's kind of hard to give this place a rating. I'd say 4-5 stars for dessert, 1-2 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Wow... I've heard great stuff about this place and have been dying to give it a try. Well, I stopped by the drive-tru for my first time today and got the standard Culver's double cheeseburger meal.

I was soooo disappointed! The fires were just like grocery store frozen fries and the burger is without a doubt the greasiest one I've ever eaten by a long shot! I can't believe it is so busy with Wendy's and Carl's Jr. right across the street. Stick with Carl's Jr. for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times (Culver's in general not just this location) and got to get $1 burgers at an anniversary event for another Culver's and every time I just do not see the lure. The burgers kind of taste of lightly-to-none seasoned charred pieces of cardboard. I suppose that the hope is having butter on the buns will make up for the beef's inadequacies.

The only thing going for it is the $1 waffle cone days which can be nice for a cheap outing to satisfy a sweet tooth but their ice cream/custard is in no way the best out there. If only we could bring some smash burger or Goodtimes from the west.

So clearly Culver's advertising campaign is working for them but they will not receive my business. I can see the eat no meat argument from the taste of these burgers."}
{"text":"Always great food, burgers are always tasty, custard is rich, and the cheese curds and onion rings take the prize."}
{"text":"I grew up in Milwaukee, WI so this is a taste of home to me.  If you've never had custard or cheese curds and your not in Wisconsin you need to try them here at least.  It's high quality fast food if thats possible.  The food is cooked fresh once you order so it comes out piping hot.  Can't go wrong here if your getting fast food."}
{"text":"This gets two stars only because of the custard and then you'd better like vanilla or chocolate. The flavor of the day is just mix ins to those flavors. Burgers are thin and greasy. Best bet is the cod on its own, not a basket or sandwich. This is definitely not the inexpensive fast food option. Add to that that the service is poor."}
{"text":"I love Culver's I really do they are top notch, I could never dream of giving less than 5 stars. However when it comes to their condiments just put them in the bag. You always try to hand them to me and I'll leave them in my truck. Put them in with my food or in a separate bag. Tonight I ordered one piece of fish because I love it I'm diabetic and shouldn't even be eating there white flower but I love it. Got home no tartar sauce so frustrated. It was still delicious would have been better with tartar sauce. Come on guys get the condiment things lined out. It's the little things that make a big difference. See you tomorrow"}
{"text":"I am from Wisconsin and was ecstatic when I heard we were getting a Culver's here in the Carolinas less than 10 minutes from my house.  I've been to this location a handful of times now and have consistently been disappointed.  Just doesn't meet the same expectations I have when I'm visiting a Culver's in Wisconsin.  My order has been messed up on a multiple occasions and today my burger was soaking in grease so much that my burger was served to me in a puddle.  I keep telling myself it's a new location and it'll get better, but so far it hasn't.  Maybe I'll give it another shot, but I won't be going out of my way anytime soon to go back to this location."}
{"text":"Prices on cement mixers are never the same even though I order the same thing every time, that ok, I'm not hurting over 50 cents. 
They almost always make me pull up and wait, that's ok, I'm not hurting for twenty minutes 
the thing that absolutely ruins it for me is the service, and that makes the other things so much less ok. 

Tonight I had the misfortune of having Yasmin take my order and cash me out. She was incredibly rude. She rolled her eyes when I asked for something extra, balled her fists and breathed like she was trying to calm herself down when I offered to pay for the extra item, and snapped at me when I asked for her manager. While we were waiting for the manager she looked at me and said \"so are you still going to pay for your food or are you going to try and get this for free?\" 

Seriously, fire this girl."}
{"text":"Stars are for the Custard/Ice Cream. Haven't tried anything else but holy smoke that custard is outrageous good. I don't even want to look at calories. If you're in the mood for anything ice cream, THIS is the place to get it. Prices are smoking good too. Great stuff."}
{"text":"Consistently good service and good food at reasonable prices. Drive-thru service is always quick, efficient, friendly and helpful (they always let you know if ordering food a different way will save you money)."}
{"text":"There are no Culver's where I'm from, so it's nice to try out a chain I don't usually have access to.  It's a perfectly passable fast food burger.  They're quick, the food gets you full, and it's affordable.  I had the Butterburger with cheese.  Mine could have been a little hotter and a little more seasoned, but other than that it was good.  I also tried out the cheese curds, because life is long enough already, and they were a good change of pace from the usual side of fries."}
{"text":"One of the nicest fast food places I've ever been in. The prices are too high for the food, but it's good stuff. With nothing else available in that area, this place is tops."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want your food fast but don't want to feel like you're sitting in a fast food restaurant. The eating area is clean and much classier than your average booth at Burger King. There are large flat screen TVs with SpongeBob for the kids (or, you know, me) and ESPN for disinterested dads (or in my case, my boyfriend).

The burgers are about as good as you get them at Smashburger - but Culver's is a better value, in my opinion. For about $10 at Smashburger you can get fries, a drink, and a regular sized burger. At Culver's, for about the same price you can get a double burger, fries, and a medium concrete mixer. 

So, yes, the burgers are wonderful, and the custard is as heavenly as it sounds. The fries, I'm pretty sure, were brought in from the closest frozen food section. (They didn't taste bad at all, just not like what you would expect at a restaurant.) The service was good; not perfect, but definitely acceptable. 

I will definitely be back, but I still need to try Smashburger's Nutter Butter shake..."}
{"text":"Holy Christmas that's some great ice cream!  

The food here is typical of fast food or Denny's type fare.  The cheese curds (which I love more than back rubs and craft beer) are less than mediocre.  Anybody that's visited the midwest, will not be able to describe cheese curds without drool physically escaping their lips.  This is fact.  Culver's cheese curds made me die a little inside as I ate them.  These things will make you feel like you're cheating on a diet you're not actually on.  Sigh...

Why four stars dude?  Um...have you had their ice cream?  Yes sir...it was that good.  Mint chocolate ninja backflip explosion...or whatever it was called.  Some major Homer Simposon droolage.  Mmmmm ice cream...

Try:  Did you even read this?

Avoid:  Cheese curds if you're from the midwest"}
{"text":"Best burger in Mesa. Cheese curds are amazing. Grew up in Wisconsin, so when I get homesick... 

Stick with the basics, burgers, fries, and custard."}
{"text":"Damn my neglectful parents who never bothered give me frozen custard as a child! I have let 28 long years pass. I can't ever get those years back, but I can take control of my own destiny and make sure it becomes a permanent fixture in my life. 
Culver's has two staples. Chocolate and Vanilla. Boring? Not any more. Not when it's creamy, smooth, and rich. They have Marshmallow fluff as a topping!
They also have a \"flavor of the day\" that you can check out on their website.  
I had great customer service, too!"}
{"text":"Pleasant place for a quick dessert treat!  Our little ones love the Concrete Mixers!  Clean and family friendly."}
{"text":"Why would you ever go to another fast food burger place after you've been to Culver's?  Wow!  They fry their burgers in butter ~ hence the butter burger experience.  They have awesome burgers, fries and the best frozen custard!  

Sure they offer other dinning options such as salads, roast, chicken and they have the coolest cheese curd thingies that are addictive, but it's their burgers and custard that makes this place a must stop by when your craving fast food."}
{"text":"Terrible service by Fonzie, Richie, Betty Boop, Veronica and the crew! Taking a dinner to a friend in need. Ordered fried chicken and they don't have any. Asked for shrimp dinner for the price of chicken . When I get to window Veronica tell me she misunderstood and its $12.50! BS did I take a wrong turn and drive to Red Lobster!!!  Then Fonzie states that is bad business he can't give me shrimp for the price of chicken.  Lost a customer over $1.75 for a 6 pc shrimp. -4 stars... 
These businesses need to stop putting minimum wage teenagers in charge who possess no customer service skills. No worries as a restaurateur I know how to cook. Made it my damn self and delivered to friend in need.. Booyah!"}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly service. Best frozen custard I've EVER had. Try a Chocolate Marshmallow malt!"}
{"text":"Another great spot for burgers...
The burgers remind me of BK or The Habit Burger Grill, due to its pickled taste. 
Aside from burgers, the sides are pretty good stuff. Cheese curds are absolutely delicious. The fries and onion rings are great, but nothing out of this world. The milk shake is pretty awesome. It sort of tastes like the one from...Habit Burger Grill.

Wait...

Dude, this place does taste like The Habit Burger Grill. Anyone else feel the same?"}
{"text":"I work for a company based out of Wisconsin, so I've heard nothing but praise for this place. 

All in all, pretty damn good. The burger was quite good, better than Freddy's. The crickle cut fries were nothing too special, but they were hot, fresh, and had just the right amount of salt. The onion rings were great for fast food. The concrete (my choice was chocolate with oreo mixed in) was was better than most shakes. 

The only real disappointment were the cheese curds. Granted, I just got back from a trip to Wisconsin, where you can get fried cheese curds everywhere, but man, they were boring. They reminded me of those boring cheese sticks you can get at any bar. 

It isn't In-n-out, but it isn't trying to be, so the endless comparisons are a bit baffling.

All in all, worth the occasional trip out."}
{"text":"I had bomb icecream custard. It had coconut, almond, chocolate, and fudge. It was creamy and soothing."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. The frozen custard is amazing  The employees are professional and kind. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love to get the kid's meal. You can get a small burger, fries and there's a coupon for custard on the bag. Just the perfect size meal and love those butter burgers!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing this place for awhile and finally checked it out. I was pleasantly suprised and really loved it. I got the double bacon cheese and it was damn good. They also had cheese curds which I havent seen anywhere in az carry those. I'm from the Midwest where they have cheese curds so I was blown away that they had them and they were bomb..highly recommend culver's"}
{"text":"This experience was not up expectations. It is all about price and getting tasty food for a bit more. Today was not one of those days. Pricy - 30+ dollars for family of four. No desserts ordered - just the custard that comes with kids meal.
 Went here for dinner ordered 3 piece cod, pot roast sandwich, and two kids meals (corn dog and chicken strips).

Service was friendly and helpful, kept counter and dining area clean.

Food came out fast, but was very bland - fish was mushy and lacked that crunch from being deep fried."}
{"text":"Twenty minutes for 1 cheeseburger in the drive through, I'll never go back. Totally unacceptable for fast food."}
{"text":"The mushroom swissburger was massive and tasted amazing. The manager is great and makes sure you are taken care of. Love this culvers! Ive been coming here 4 years. I wish they would go back to the larger concrete mixers though."}
{"text":"Custard is pretty good-but pricey for what you get-a la Cold Stone.
Burgers are good-menu seems to be trying too hard to offer too many things to too many people. I like the cheese curds though-more places should have them.
I'm told this is a midwestern chain, which explains some of it.
The staff is almost eerily pleasant, and at first it was a little off-putting, but now I like it compared to the standard indifference you get at most places."}
{"text":"Have only been through the drive thru, and both times service was quick, correct and delicious. Welcome to Verrado!"}
{"text":"The service at this particular Culvers has been awful. Wrong orders each time we've gone there-be sure to check the bag before you leave. The staff goofs off with no supervision and no respect for the customers-poor service. By the time we waited for our food and then waited again for them to fix the order our food was cold and a waste of $60 each time for our large family. If you like to pay too much for bad service, wrong orders and cold food this Culvers is for you. 

We do like Culvers. This one is horrible though."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype...wasn't impressed. Our order was right and we got it pretty quickly, so 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"I'm so impressed with the customer service at this location.  The staff is fantastic every time I come.  The food is great, too! I'll definitely continue to give my business."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly service! I am very impressed with this place. Surpassed all of my expectations"}
{"text":"Yay for Chicken Tenders! Culver's is an amazing chain with the best hamburgers, I'm sorry, Butterburgers around! The custard is fresh and made daily in wonderful seasonal flavors."}
{"text":"!!THIS IS BAD !! We've been to this location a couple of times and received very poor service from the counter help, but the WORST incident was the other day when we stopped there. My husband went to the men's room to wash his hands first before we ordered (thank God) and in there he found that someone had used the bathroom counter as a toilet. Big mess of #2 fecal matter.  
We left immediately; tried calling the restaurant from the car. After trying twice we could get no answer. The third try we got through and asked to speak to the manager. The person on the other end was crazy. She said you guys have already called and spoke to our manager! you don't need to speak to her again!  ??!!  We insisted we didn't call and get through to anyone and she kept interrupting until she finally started yelling over the phone. We hung up, called the health department, then went back to the restaurant. We went in side and spoke to a very young manager and let her know we were just trying to help their business by telling them about the poop. but because of her or her employees ridiculous behavior on the phone, we went to the health department. 
We asked to have the owner of the franchise (owns the one on Cave Creek too). name & number. no number available. We called the Cave Creek location and asked the manager there to give our name and number to the owner and have him call us. That call back never came. 
So disappointing!  I am from Wisconsin where Culvers originated. How shameful their lack of training and service is here."}
{"text":"Confusing menu and just too expensive.   Single burger. Onion rings. Chocolate malt came to over $10.   And supposedly malts were on sale. I left. Went across the street to in/out burger where i paid $6.  Culver's is tasty...but not for price."}
{"text":"I really like their concrete mixers. I am disappointed that the Culvers at this location doesn't hand out dog treats when they see you have dogs in your car going through the drive through. Most of the other Culvers, especially the East side one always handed those out. It's just nice customer service when they do that."}
{"text":"It is what it is with culvers, decent food at a decent price. The staff can be friendly depending on the person and the day they're having. All in all just what you need out of fast food."}
{"text":"The food was good, and the shakes were delish!  It did remind me of a Dairy Queen/Wendy's.  They had good customer service."}
{"text":"Love coming here for some custard! Their mixers and sundaes are great. Whenever they offer Mint, I'm especially there. They have good chicken strips and fries but the food is a bit more pricey vs other fast food places."}
{"text":"The Swiss burger was alright. I don't know about the fries though. It was hard to get a table in there."}
{"text":"The food you cannot beat. I drive all the way from california and the first thing i get is a culvers burger cause we don't have culvers in california.  

I love the burgers, cheese curds, and shakes!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely have it MY WAY every time at Culvers. I think their cheese burgers with grilled onions ,no bun, and fries with a root beer are the bomb. The price is right and the servers are always pleasant. I appreciate that the dining area and restrooms are always clean. I am glad it is a stones throw away from my house because I can go there often. They also have a drive through that is quick. The only downside is parking sometimes because it is usually busy."}
{"text":"I have 4 men in the family and they love Culver's burgers. They would eat there everyday if they could. I tried one and it was so good. They have great salads there too, which I get. Salads are always fresh. My granddaughter gets the chicken fingers and loves them. This is the best burger place in AZ. I lived here all my life. Highly recommend! It is a WooHoo! As good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Good this place is so F**king awesome! Would recommend to anyone! Allie is the most kind and generous employee!"}
{"text":"Out here visiting, tried it out ands can't complain.  Very good food, love how the menu shows very clear.  Owner Joe hooked it up he's awesome great service from all the employees. Clean restaurant and restrooms, definitely will come again if I visit again!"}
{"text":"Not usually a fast food fan, but the burgers were great and fries fresh and delicious.  Frozen custard was a treat too.  I always visit when I am in the area."}
{"text":"So this could be a 4.5 star rating IF the staff would not have been eating a dominos pizza  in front of us that some random girl from dominos brought in on her bike... Then when we asked if the custards sitting on a tray off to the back were ours (one girl munching on pizza next to them), the next girl brought them to us and said they were just finished... Not pleased at all with the service. Btw the custard was yummy. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Fast service. 
Friendly staff.
Great food ... and thats an understatement!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend going to this restaurant at night. It's a terrible restaurant run by a bunch of irresponsible kids who like to throw your food around. (and who knows what else?) There must be twenty teenage employees goofing around in this restaurant at night and they still can't seem to accomplish a simple task without taking forever and still screwing it up. They could get rid of half these kids, who don't want to work anyway, and replace them with one responsible adult who they pay a little more, and they would save a lot of money, and the restaurant would be a lot better. If you ask for a manager you just get another kid claiming to be a manager. If you're going to go here I would strongly advise doing it during the day when they have an adult manager. I can't wait for the robot employees!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING the're foods always fresh and they greet you with a smile. Id highly suggest mmm everything lol."}
{"text":"There. Is. A. Culver's. In. North. Carolina. 

Ok, I got that out of the way up front.  I was at Ikea and I saw the Culver's sign ... and did the double take about what state I was in, so I was drooling for my butter burger before I even got past the Swedish checkout counter.  Sure beats flying to Minneapolis to get good Midwestern food."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!  Not much to say but the staff is nice and the food was very good as always.  Everything tasted fresh and the whole family really enjoyed themselves.  The custard at the end is always a real treat."}
{"text":"Culver's (based out of Sauk City, Wisconsin) has an odd business model. It LOOKS like a table service restaurant and the dining area is nice enough to be one. But it's a counter service joint. Denise and I went there for lunch on 3/3/12, mainly because we saw a pic of their fish and chips. Turns out it's mostly burgers and grilled sandwiches with only one fish and chips meal offered. Prices seemed in line, though the fish and chips was kind of high compared to the other food at $9.29 for a two piece. But the fish was DELICIOUS. North Atlantic cod with a great batter, VERY fresh, first-rate. Came with fries (the dreaded crinkle fries), a very good cole slaw and a roll. Quick food delivery, we liked the place. They're building one now that's closer to us (at the 10 and Avondale Blvd) so we'll probably go to it when it's done. They had a pot roast sandwich that looked interesting..."}
{"text":"you forgot to give me the gravy for my chicken tenders and no spoon to eat my mashed potatoes, again !!!!!  just got home after picking up dinner from culver's at deer valley & 19 ave, phx, az and disappointed again. it's been months since i've been to culver's because they can't get a drive thru order right to save their lives. today i order a 4 piece chicken strip with a side of mashed potatoes with gravy, a side of gravy for my chicken strips and a large order of cheese curds. they are so quick to make you move forward when there is no one else in line. why don't you teach your employees to concentrate on the customer instead of lecturing your customers on why they have to move  forward. i encourage everyone to post on  yelp and facebook every time culver's get your orders wrong!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mcfarland's premiere community supporter! Great food, friendly staff and very tolerant of kids- what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Awesome custard and burgers.  Nothing says greasy happiness like cheese curds.  They do it right considering they are a big chain.."}
{"text":"Walked in 10 minutes to close and was told by the manager that they were closing soon and that they needed to kick everyone out then. He said \"you can order food if you want, but you won't be able to eat it here.\" Thanks, we won't eat there. Congrats on getting out of there on time."}
{"text":"I used to like it but I ordered some chicken and they said it was ready and I ended up waited 30 minutes and it was raw!!!btw Sonny did an awesome job!"}
{"text":"A co-worker of mine has been waiting weeks for Culver's to open and they finally have on 19th Ave & Deer Valley.  Apparently it's a big deal in Wisonsin, and they are now expanding to the west.  Today was the second day it was open and the place was packed, we had to wait in line for about 10 minutes.  Luckily we found a table that just opened up because I didn't see any other available. 

Pretty good as far as fast food goes.  Everything is made fresh to order - major bounus.  I had the butter burger w/cheese & crinkle fries and we split cheese bites made with Wisonsin cheddar.  All 3 were very tasty, hot and fresh. They also have frozen custard which I didn't try this time but will make a trip soon to sample. 

The restaurant has cute little sayings called Culverisms, for example: \"Every time you eat a crinkle fry it's like giving yourself a high-five.\" I couldn't agree more, I am a sucker for those crinkle fries."}
{"text":"Please keep the pepper grinder pub burger forever!  Best burger I've ever gotten from a drive thru!  Cheese curds are ok, but onion rings rock!"}
{"text":"I loved Culvers Fish dinner.
If only they could get my order right. 
Usually something is wrong with the order but I have to laugh and shake my head as this last time I walked in to order. There were no customers and three employees standing around the counter and one at the drive through.
I ordered a fish dinner with mashed potatoes and an Oreo concrete mixer.
I waited about 10 minutes. The girl who took my order waited with a bag open for my order to come up. She stood there knowing my order, waiting for my order bagged it gave it to me. I get home and there is no concrete mixer and there are French fries instead of mashed potatoes. 
After all the time waiting for my order and only one other customer came in and someone else took his order how the heck do you screw up that much!?!
Usually there is some screw up and I could blame it on being busy but even busy shouldn't screw up so much. 
The owner, Carissa Rose should be reading these comments and make an effort to improve on the amount of screw ups. 
This location seems to be one of worst.
The restaurant was clean and employees are friendly enough so there's that.
This last visit was the last straw so I will just go to Red Robin or Fudruckers to get my fish. It's just as good and never a screw up. I never order anything else from Culvers except fish as I find the burgers good but good burgers are everywhere.
The concrete mixer? Well I really don't need it or I could go get a blizzard at DQ."}
{"text":"The custard was really good. I had the number 8 a Carmel sundae with pralines. Tasted great. Burgers taste good also."}
{"text":"Mostly, I've only had their double Butter burgers. They are quite delicious. That is why I go there."}
{"text":"After my trip here last week was thwarted by lunch crowds and no available parking, I returned today, mid-afternoon, and breezed right in.
I really like, and have been patronizing, In-N-Out for my beef and cheese fix due to their proximity to home. However, since Culver's not only offers clearly better burgers at a nearly identical price point (yes, you had me at \"butter\"), but also the many delights and myriad dairy based dessert wonders that evolve from frozen custard, my heart's preference just has to be Culvers.

For those of you who have been disappointed with their dinner \"sides\" such as green beans and mashed potatoes, I'm not too surprised since that isn't what these places are really about at all.

Culvers is, in truth, a bloated reincarnation of classic Midwest \"Frozen Custard \" stands of the 1940's and 50's where the focus was Burgers, Fries, Malts, (and /or Shakes, if you want, or need to, date the poorer cousin.) When in doubt, and if your sweet meter allows, always order the \"malt\" over the \"shake\" for a one of a kind flavor upgrade.

The changing economies and demographics of the '60's and beyond forced the quaint, focused places to add all the oddities and dinner stuff you find today in order to exist. Stick with the basics and you should be happy here. And speaking of basics, I'm reading that a number of you aren't happy with the cheese curds. That prep is as simple as bread and butter, so if Culvers is screwing that up, shame on them.

Anyway, the service here on a Monday afternoon was great. Three cooks through the window were jabbering like monkeys that hadn't come down from the lunch rush yet, (or?) but the woman that took my order was composed and friendly. Ditto the girl who handed me the \"to go\" bag.

Also, since I'm a single diner preferring to dine out in-home, I've developed a reliable weight-to value indicator in my left hand. (the  one carrying the sack) After taste and satisfaction are factored, Culvers was the hands down winner over 7 previous contenders.
2 bacon double cheese deluxe; Score!

With Culvers website showing a soon to open location at 4506 E. Cactus, (within spitting distance of In-N-Out's Tatum and Cactus store) I have serious concerns over the future for In-N Out's employees at that location. Polish your resumes, kids."}
{"text":"Been here on several occasions, I like the burgers here and the cheese curds. In fact I think I might enjoy those more than the burgers. I would say the burgers are average not bad but nothing to really write home about a quick lunch that you will enjoy. Prices are a bit steep I might add compared to what you actually get."}
{"text":"5 star fast food! Wow!

Hubby and I were in town for the Fiesta Bowl and needed to grab a little lunch before heading to the game. I checked yelp for close burger places and thought this one sounded good. Oh yes. It was. 

Not only were are burgers juicy and tasty, the cheese curds and the mashed potatoes and gravy (oh how I loved the gravy!) were also really good! And the service? Exceptional! I know I'm jaded because I live in the land of mediocre service, but this must have been the best, kindest service I've received in who knows how long. Even if the food was just ok, (and if I lived in AZ) I would come back just to say hi. These girls deserve a raise!"}
{"text":"I opened the bag when I got home and saw chili cheese fries that were soggy and cold. I also ordered cheese curds that were scattered all over the bag. I called the store and they offered me a free concrete mixer and cheese curds. I went into the store a couple days later and the guy and girl I talked to were both very rude to me and told me that I have the wrong location. I think I know what store I went to! The girl talked to me as if I did something wrong! I used to come to this Culver's three times a week but after this, they have lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the girl at the register hates her job or at least that's what her face is telling me. Soup was gross way too thick."}
{"text":"This place is fast becoming my favorite fast food burger joint!  They have yet to make a mistake on my drive thru orders and I really do like there burger S ( mmmmm so buttery) and big fries    Good service and food means a good rating."}
{"text":"Secret menu tip:
Order the \"old-fashioned soda\": soda water, custard and sundae topping (peach or strawberry) mixed and with a scoop of custard.

or just get the custard with great hot fudge."}
{"text":"We were there on the Opening Day, Monday by 6pm. Hubby and son have been waiting for the opening. We expected long wait and seating challenge of course, that's given, so we ordered for to go and just found a space to wait for our food. The staff seemed overwhelmed. 30mins and we were still waiting. They have paper trail with orders and they can't seem to find it. Eventually, they had to put in the order and asked us to wait again. Many months after, once in a while we go thru the drive thru and ALWAYS have to be asked to move forward and wait for the order...most often I would call this SLOWFOOD."}
{"text":"This location is very inconsistent in filling orders through the  drive thru.  I like Culvers, and it is on my way home from work.  However, three times now, my flavor of the day custard was made wrong.  All three times, on separate occasions, the \"turtle\" or \"caramel turtle\" either did not have chocolate in it or was something else other than \"turtle\".  My order tonight also was not complete...missing sauce for my chicken strips!  I called and spoke with the manager on duty to report the missing sauce and the previous inconsistencies. Then when I discovered my custard was not correctly made, I called again.  The second time, the manager tried to dispute tonight's custard batch, saying that he saw chocolate in the current batch.  However, mine does not have ANY chocolate in it!  It just seemed like he did not care about the lack of consistency in filling orders and making their custard accurately.  I just want them to be consistent  with drive thru orders, make their custards correctly as ordered and as the recipe calls for!  I will definitely think twice before ordering custard from this location again...which is a shame, because I like them and they are on my way home.  Check your order before leaving the drive thru..."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if your idea of good cooking is to slather everything in butter, because that's exactly what they do. I got the pot roast with mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes tasted like cardboard. I could see why they drowned them in gravy. The green beans were boiled and waxy, with onions and butter. First time I ever threw away green beans. The beef was okay. The beef stew was on top of bread, which was mush within a minute because of all the gravy. 

The employees were super friendly, but that doesn't count for much if the food is bad. They should rename the store Butter n Stuff."}
{"text":"My family and I have enjoyed heading out to this Culver's for a couple of years now. Love the courteous staff, timely service, and of course the frozen custard, and cheese curds. They even say bye as you leave. Satisfactory experience every time!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted dessert last night, so we went to Culver's. It was about 9 PM and the restaurant does not close until 11, so we were expecting everything to be pretty much up and running still. I've had nothing but pleasant experiences at other Culver's locations before.

While I was ordering, my cashier was friendly, but did not know how to ring up a coupon. He asked another cashier and she helped him. After he asked for help, he still didn't get it and he asked her again. He still did not know how to ring up a coupon. The first two cashiers then got a supervisor and we eventually got our coupon entered into the register.

Once we eventually got our total, the register did not read my credit card. I then tried another card and it did not read. He offered ringing us up on another register, but I decided I did not want to go through the ordering process again. I eventually paid in cash (not something I normally like to do since I don't like loose change). The cashier was really apologetic, but still, he could have received better training or supervision.

While this was going on, another family who had been there since before I arrived was waiting for their order. I noticed a staff member in the back yell \"order up\" and there was clearly an order ready to be served. The family who was waiting kept telling one of the cashiers that his order was up, but there was a group of about four or five employees nearby (including the supervisor) standing and talking, paying no attention to the family who had by then been there for a long time. It was clear to me that that family was not happy. The restaurant was clearly not understaffed.

Normally, Culver's (and almost any other business) gives out receipts. I was really surprised I did not get one because at this point, I knew I wanted to leave feedback. Once I got my table placard, I got a table and waited patiently for my order to be delivered.

After approximately ten minutes of not getting our order delivered to our table, my girlfriend decided to go to the counter to ask about our order.

They asked if we ordered a strawberry sundae. We did not. When my girlfriend told them what we ordered, the staff member saw our order, but noticed it had been sitting for quite a while. In fact, both of our items had been partially melted. They remade one (I'm not sure why they didn't re-make the other) and we got both sundaes.

On a few positive notes, the custard was pretty good, the urinal screens smelled like they had recently been changed, and there was ample parking.

I have been to Culver's in Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa, Chandler, and Casa Grande, and all of those experiences have been nothing but exceptional. You can look through my profile and see that I rarely write negative reviews.

This Culver's needs some work."}
{"text":"Culvers is a past time from where I'm from the Wisconsin cheese curds just taste a little bit better when your from there. so I visit every now and again to remind me of home now on this particular day 5/9 I paid a visit to the camelback location and my o my ... I will no longer see culvers in the same light after the service I received tonight so the only reason I visited today is because I saw a coupon in my wallet for two comp cheese curds from a previous visit because when I got my curds they were still frozen ... I chucked that up as an honest mistake ..note to self don't ignore the signs...  so today i walked in and it was 2 people in front of me with two registers open so it was to the point both people were being helped so I stepped to the counter and Aldo proceeded to walk away from the registers and run orders. I figured okay they must be a little busy.. 6 minutes go past I'm still waiting ...another 4 minutes go past a lady comes to the register  I ask her you must be under staffed she said no we had someone on break..ok so I start giving her my order sourdough melt basket  ...2 cheese curds and a small cooler. and I go sit down aldo finally delivers my order with just the melt and two curds I ask him where the rest of my order is and he grabs my recipt and says that's all you ordered to I grabbed my transaction receipt to show him what I paid for and I asked for a manager he says oh I am a manager I told him his name tag clearly shows lead ... and I'm very discouraged at this point because I'm experiencing a pattern of poor service. he walks away as I'm speaking to him never offering to address the issues or rectify the situation. I was shocked he couldn't be more rude so I finished what they brought me a melt and curds and all the while he was going back and forth delivering orders never saying anything else. It's funny because the comp curds paper says try us again were sorry and though the food was not frozen this still was a bad experience"}
{"text":"On part 1 of our Great Canadian Road trip, we headed from Manitoba to Chicago and thus drove through WI. I love trying foods/restaurants/chains that are unique to each particular US State, so I insisted that we stop by Culver's to sample some of their popular items. We each had a salad and shared a Butterburger, order of cheese curds, and their famous frozen custard. Their salad was a standard salad - exactly what I expected and nothing to write home about. The cheese curds were fried and fabulous - I found a few pieces to be plenty. The Butterburger tasted like a more decadent standard burger; it was pretty good, but I wouldn't necessarily routinely go out of my way for it. The frozen custard, while delicious, was simply a creamier version of ice cream. 

Verdict: 
I'm glad we stopped to try some WI favourites. The food was pretty good, the people were friendly, and we had an all-around positive experience."}
{"text":"0 Stars since when do you order dinner and pay $20 for it and it comes out in parts first off we were tired so we came in and my husband wanted a concrete mixer it didn't come out with his meal he had to wait in the meantime I went to the counter to get the concrete mixer the help helper offered it to me and I asked to speak to the manager her name was Stephanie she was no help at all in fact he was very rude I do plan on posting this on Yelp I don't know if it's going to help or not but I also plan on reporting the help and the service and everything else especially my cold food to the owners tomorrow I know that management keeps their good help for daytime this place look like a bunch of kids running around just trying to hurry up and really screwing around and get things done I know that management keeps there good help for daytime this place look like a bunch of kids running around just trying to hurry up and Nelly scurry around and get things done not of the know how to handle customer service issues and it looks like it needs a lot more training especially with your shift managers"}
{"text":"Had never tried Culver's until yesterday. Taken together, my selections were marginally decent. Onion rings were solid: crisp and not too thick or thin. Crinkle cut fries seemed unseasoned; nothing anyone couldn't heat up at home. The biggest disappointments were the burgers themselves. Smashed in their packaging and surprisingly tasteless, I found them poorly comparable in terms of both quality and cost to many burger-centric competitors. And the batter-dipped cod sandwich was tasteless and mushy, period. I paid almost $18 for all that mess, Culver's. Never again. If anyone's curious, the second star is for prompt and pleasant service."}
{"text":"Salads are very good, large portions, and cheap. Waffle cones are yummy and they always keep the place spiffy clean! Food is brought to your car fast and is convenient."}
{"text":"Near perfect fast food. A great, hot, juicy burger cooked to perfection. The fries, onion rings and cheese curds (more on these later) have always come out hot and fresh, like they were cooked to order.

The custard is excellent. I recommend not getting a shake, but instead getting a Concrete Mixer, as it seems to be more value for the price and isn't milky/melted like the shakes.

The cheese curds are great. Think fried mozzarella bites, but with a rubbery, squeaky quality to them. These are great. Their fries, while good, are \"just\" crinkle cut and not fresh cut, so I always get the Curds as my side instead.

Prices are actually pretty decent. You can get a burger, fries and drink (even if upgrading to custard, like I do, instead of a drink) will set you back around $8-12 depending on the number of patties or fancy toppings or premium sides."}
{"text":"The employees were so kind! And the cheese curds were one of the best things I've ever tasted. The frozen custard was a perfect size and was amazing. I'd like to point out that one of the employees, Destiny, was wonderful. She's by far the best person I've ever been served by."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, amazing  custard and a friendly staff! It was our first time in and we really loved this place. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I love Culvers burgers. They are worth the extra few bucks, because I can tell their quality of beef, etc is better than (most).  Service was very professional and friendly - this staff is good at what they do.  Previous reviewer whom gave them only 3 stars because of CHEESE?  seriously?  Go eat a salad or something lady!  This is good eats and worth the coin!  I only give them 4 stars because of the prices ... adding a soda to your order is $, and I think their pricing could be lowered a bit on the extras which don't cost them much of anything anyway."}
{"text":"Here's my pro tip: you can get a 'Family' sized order of onion rings. Nom! Get it... You're welcome.

Oh and don't forget the Chipotle Ranch dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"Solid burgers and chicken sandWiches that hit the spot.  Clean environment.  Love the $1 waffle cone days!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I go there after church all the time with my friends. We have so much fun and the people there are very nice and they have fast service. it's my favorite restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Go to Culvers! But don't hold up the line cause I gotta get a deluxe with cheese, The best burgers period"}
{"text":"Worst service I have experienced in my entire life. There was multiple people standing back there while I waited so long to order. Will not be returning to this location. If you are in town please go to the McDonald's and not the Culver's"}
{"text":"Very good for fast food. Great service. Nice building. 

The kids meal burger is plenty for me. Way better than a standard kids meal burger!  I've tried other menu items (rueben and fish) and both were good. 

The fries are the only real let down for me. They aren't my fav. 

The custard alone is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Frozen custard: do you need another reason to show up? 

Pros: 
- The burgers aren't bad. The secret to a good burger is the bun. It's hard to go wrong with a good bun slathered in butter. They post the calorie content on the menu, so it's definitely not a daily or weekly (or even monthly?) kind of joint. 
- Improbably inexpensive. How do they do it?

Cons:
- Improbably inexpensive. What did I just eat???"}
{"text":"The Culver's staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The building and facilities are clean and functional with a couple nice decorative touches.

Culver's offers some outstanding food. The shaved prime rib sandwich and Culver's Deluxe burger are both excellent. The side dishes are also a notch above most fast food places.

Half of the reason to come to Culver's is some great dessert. The shake I had on my last visit was above average. However, their Concrete Mixers are extremely delicious and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch because it was near.
I had the red pepper double cheeseburger with bacon and fries and drink combo.
Overpriced.
Thin bacon.
Nice BBQ sauce (asked for a container for the burger).
Crinkle-cut fries I didn't like the taste of.
Pepsi MAX tasted off.
Overpriced. Near 8 bucks.
You can take grandma, nice place, nice people, fast and friendly service. Clean.
Overpriced.
I enjoyed the burger but it went fast.
Strange taste. I guess that was the \"butter burger\" taste. I'm not used to that.
Overpriced.
Burger King beats this place for flavor.
Overpriced. Do they pay these prices in Wisconsin?
I wasn't very full even after forcing down those fries. 
Maybe your grandma will be."}
{"text":"Best custard ever!  I can't seem to get enough!   This place is always clean, staff is super friendly, burgers, fries and cheese curds are scrumptious too.  Join their email club and you will get plenty of coupons, plus announcements of special event days.  They had a 1 year anniversary special where we enjoyed $1 one scoop sundaes for 4 days in a row.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Went with my family on a Friday night out and decided to give culver's a try since I had just won a coupon on their Facebook site for a free fish sandwich. We waited for 20 minutes in line and then come to find out the manager refuses to accept it as a coupon. He gives a made up excuse that they aren't a participating store and laughs in my face. Of all people you would think the manager would know how to treat customers with respect and kindness. We left after publicly being humiliated and went to sonic for dinner instead. I hope culver's corporate learns how to better train their managers in customer service because the surprise store sure needs the help."}
{"text":"Gluten-free/Celiac beware! I have celiac disease so I have limited options, and Culver's is one of the few fast food restaurants that offers gluten free buns. I'm generally pleased with their food and service. However, this location is awful. 90% of the time that they hand me my order (they keep the meat and cheese in it's own box), the box is upside down and the cheese is completely stuck to the box. They never give me the condiments I ask for either. So virtually *every time* I come here, I have to check the bag, go inside, and wait for a new patty with cheese. They've offered a free dessert coupon once. The bun inside of the wrapper is consistently soggy as well, when it's fluffy and dry at other locations. It's not a Culver's issue, it's an issue with this particular restaurant!"}
{"text":"The sourdough melts never fail. I notice walk in seems faster than drive thru...but i like to come in and eat. The staff are nice and always ask if y need anything. The bathroom and lobby are clean always!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant. Yolanda took my order and she was friendly and knowledgeable, I really enjoyed talking with her.

The store was clean and ready to go for lunch. I appreciated that. 

The food was delicious as always! I got the 2 piece cod dinner and it was really nice. I could barely walk to my car I was so full!

Nice work"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, and this is the most west coast edition of this place in relation to Southern California.

We stopped in on our way back to Cali as it was hot (surprise surprise) and we got a burger, cheese curds, and custard.  

All in all it was pretty good.  Burger wasn't among the best I'd ever had, but I was satisfied after the meal."}
{"text":"My first visit here was less than great but my most recent was solid.  What changed?  This time the burger tasted much fresher and the lettuce and tomato on it were crisp and tasty.  I love their cheese curds and would choose them over fries any day of the week."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service! Really clean and nice place   Definitely recommend if you're looking for a good burger!"}
{"text":"Very consistent food and service.  Well worth the $ paid.  We enjoy Culver's several times a month.  Fast food but two steps above the competition.  Snack pac's are just the right size for my Wife and Myself most days..and at $5 + - a really good value."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and figured time to review.  I called in my order. ..Colby pub burger and crispy fries. She asked what time I would be there,  I said now,  I'm across the street.  No I need a time she said.  Ok, provided a time, literary 3 minutes from current time.  I guess I'm accustomed to someone saying your order will be ready in \"insert number of mintues\". Then the phone was abruptly hung up. So I was ok, I will headed over and hope for the best.

Arrived and unfortunately even if you do a phone order, you still need to stand in line with those ordering inside. If you are offering phone order service, have a designated area. Food was ready, paid and filled my drink. Also double checked my order, always a must with fast food. Burger was delcious and fries were crispy.

Food 5 stars, location 4 stars and service 3. Yes it's fast food but be above your standards of McDonald's or Burger King and throw me some pleasantries please."}
{"text":"Everytime i go here i am blown away at the performance and how friendly their employees. The service is always quick and the food is always wonderful would recommend."}
{"text":"This culvers has good service, however the hamburger was squashed flat and essentially burnt like a piece of proverbial shoe leather!  Maybe just a bad day in the kitchen, or the cooks don't speak English like many other establishments where management tries to hire the lowest common denominator...."}
{"text":"i like crispy meat patties and butter atop around surrounding the burger.  

onions of the fried ring type i also like. 

i don't like that did not have the fried cheese curds, so i like that i'll have to swing on by this place again to pop those curds."}
{"text":"It broke my heart to see the staff make food for folks who didn't actually order it (appeared to have made too much) throw away the items that no one claimed. The staff should be trained to offer complimentary items when too much is made, versus throwing out perfectly good food in front of a line full of guests. What a waste!"}
{"text":"The food is just average, but their customer service is great and so is their constantly changing Frozen Custard menu. Make sure you subscribe to their text messaging system for promotions... they get me everytime!"}
{"text":"I'm from California and ate here while traveling to visit family in the area. I ordered 2x grilled chicken sandwiches with a side of cheese curds and they were excellent. I would recommend this spot over any of the big name fast food places."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend and we got the usual and we were well taken care of by a young lady names Korrine and she was so nice working hard told us she was working bc someone called in and she was really busy so i went ahead and gave her a $5 tip and she was so great ful and couldn't stop thanking me !"}
{"text":"Great food, impressive menu, very clean. Can't wait to go back, even though I lost my sunglasses there!"}
{"text":"I love this Culver's, love the Burgers and Fried Chicken Dinner..... of course the Ice Cream. Just one little thing every time I order Fried Chicken , they are either out or double check if they have any chicken... lol , no big deal .Over in all it's very good no complaints here , nice place to take your kids they will love it...."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Culvers. It's nothing special and is comparable to Wendy's or any other fast food burger place."}
{"text":"Basically just another fast food joint, nothing impressive. I'm not sure what the hype is but I've been to two Culver's now and they have both underwhelmed me."}
{"text":"Really great restaurant!  The friendly staff took the order quickly. The beverage selection was impressive. The whole restaurant was very clean. The staff member Yvonne was so helpful with placing an ice cream order, and she was so nice! Great job, Yvonne!"}
{"text":"When they first opened, this was my favorite burger joint.  Aside from the fact that there's an In N Out right across the street, this place is clearly in the same league as they both offer super greasy restaurant-quality burgers in a fast-food setting.  I'd say the burgers are on par with In N Out, but they have a lot more options.  I'm sure In N Out has a lot of variations, too, but they'd rather keep their menu secret so hipsters will sound cool ordering \"Animal Style\" or whatever.  Culver's still has the advantage when it comes to variety, though, as they have other food, including dinners similar to what you might find at Boston Market.  They also have frozen custard and cheese curds for teh win!

As for taste, my first bite of a Bacon Butter Burger really hit me, I couldn't hep but take notice of how tasty it was.  It reminded me of my first bite of a Double-Double at In N Out, lol.  It was my favorite burger joint  until I discovered Rocket Burger.  I visited the Camelback location, but was disappointed.  The food at the Metrocenter location is consistently good, however.

All in all, the burgers are great, and the varied menu and the special custard flavors keep things interesting."}
{"text":"Cheese curds and the root beer(tastes like root beer when I was a kid). When they have Walleye dinner, these are the reasons I go to Culver's. Not a fan of the custard."}
{"text":"Culvers has some good food without it being too pricey but everytime I go there to eat, especially in the drive thru, they mess up my order and then get an attitude and give off bad body language when I come in to get it fixed.. What's the point of the drive thru if I have to get out of my car to go in because they messed up? You need to repeat the order back when taking the order and while accepting payment to ensure its correct. I think this establishment deserves only 2 stars for those reasons."}
{"text":"I love this location ....so far the customer service has been impeccable....and the food is awesome
...especially the cod and the double butter bacon burger...yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"My favorite place when I'm in az. Their food is good quality, the sweet treats are good, and they have CHEESE CURDS!!! So delish! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family. Love the shakes! Food was a bit pricey but portions were decent size. Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Living near here, I come to this Culver's quite often with my daughters. No complaints. It has the typical quality, delicious food I expect from Culver's. Restaurant is always very clean and the staff is friendly. Has never been so packed that we couldn't find a place to sit, which had happened many times at some Madison Culver's locations. I don't normally eat fast food, but Culver's isn't your typical fast food so I make an exception. My daughters love that the kid's meal includes a scoop of custard. I love the snack packs which are very reasonably priced and get me my butter burger, fries, and drink for around $4. Also, and I'm mentioning this because I never noticed before, if you save 10 of the scoopy tickets off of the kids meal bags you can either get a prize OR a free kids meal. I never cared enough about my kids bringing home more junk to save the tickets but now that I realize they could get a free kids meal I will be saving them."}
{"text":"I was told I'd love Culver's, and not to miss the Turtle sundae. We ordered food to go (after a baseball game) and were asked to pull forward to the waiting lanes even though there was no one behind us. It took a while for the order but the gal brought out the food in a bag to our car. We planned to eat back at our hotel and when we opened our food, surprise...no sundae, no dressing for my salad (and no napkins or utensils). My son's sandwich was supposed to be no pickles. Instead he had pickles and no lettuce. No sauce or anything on the sandwich. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a custard treat after a day of traveling.

As Culver's does just about everything right, so did this location.

Super nice counter lady gave me a mom's size portion of custard.

Can't go wrong with Culver's."}
{"text":"I've been waiting at the drive thru for 30 min. Let me know you're short staffed BEFORE I order."}
{"text":"This place is a-ok

This is my 1st visit here. I've been actually getting emails from them since they opened the location in university. I didn't realise that the menu was this extensive. I read reviews from my fellow yelpers to decide what to order. I ordered a tender basket. The tenders and the fries were good. My bf had the mushroom swiss burger. He liked it. The staff were helpful with answering our questions and bringing our food. I would come again to try the custard"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Was given the complete wrong order and it also had a giant hair in it. Girl did not give me a receipt so they did not give me a refund, even though it was a food safety and sanitary issue. Never again! You suck Culvers!"}
{"text":"I needed a little pick me up, so went to the Culver's drive-through for a chocolate shake... 

To me, it tasted like artificial frozen sugar syrup - Not unlike the ice cream at Dairy Queen.

I maybe had three or four sips before deeming it undrinkable and throwing the rest away.

Disappointing, considering all the hype from the Wisconsiners when Culvers first opened up in the valley about a year ago!"}
{"text":"Burgers are always fresh, servers are always friendly! Prices are a bit steep but this place is as good as Five Guys..."}
{"text":"Culver's is probably as good of a fast restaurant that you can find.

I love their burgers, but really wish they didn't put the pickle on top of them. That just looks silly and I think I am going to start ordering mine without the pickle on top.

I have had mostly good experiences at this location, although they have messed up my order a couple of times and once the ice cream we got was so awful that we had to throw it away. We suspected something was wrong with the machine on that day.

In any case though, the food at Culver's is a lot better than at other fast food restaurants. I also love that they give out coupons with fairly good values."}
{"text":"Waited for this Culvers to open, was not disappointed! Culvers has set a new gold standard for fast food  dining! Cheese curds were unbelievable!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch,the burgers were juicy and mouth watering.The frys were hot,the pumkin pie custard was to die for. The service seems to be slipping.The counterwomen was rude,almost obnoxious.The boy delivering the food very uninterested in being pleasant.We hope service gets back to normal or we will being finding a new burger place."}
{"text":"I'm going to let you all in on a little secret...this Culver's location features a daily dollar item. Everything ranging from $1 cheese curds to $1 waffle cones and caramel cashew sundaes. It's a surprise everyday! I'm also a big fan of the $4 Snackpak...a butterburger, fries and a drink for only $4. You can't get this kind of value at your more traditional fast food chains these days. 

Although the burgers are pretty greasy and the custard probably has more fat than I want to contemplate, Culver's is a great treat every now and again."}
{"text":"Culver's is a solid comfort food choice at fairly reasonable prices.  Their burgers and fries are tasty, and the custard is delicious.  The selection is mainly burgers, and fried chicken, so not much for the vegetarian and vegan crowd.  The food is very \"midwestern\" so if you are looking for a meal that is really interesting to the taste buds, this likely is not the place.

I am not sure why people think the price is that awful.  They almost always have coupons in the local advertising magazines.  They also offer a student discount if you show your I Card.  My dinners of a double burger with fries and a soda often end up being $6-$7 which really isn't far from McDonalds or lesser quality establishments' prices these days.

I will admit that the burgers are greasy.  The custard is also, well, custard; so it is quite fatty.  However, do you really go to a fast food place to be health conscious?

Overall Culver's is a good, reasonably priced option for made to order food with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, and service is too. Custards are the reason to go to Culver's. The best!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I just went to Culvers for the 1st time in Tempe. The customer service created by far the best experience I've ever had @ a restaurant. The cashier's name was Teresa and she was very knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. I got my food to go and when we were walking out our hands were full. Teresa sprinted to the door to open it for us. When we got home and ate the food it was excellent and had no mistakes. I cant express how highly I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"5 stars for the frozen custard.  I live in the Milwaukee area, home to many classic frozen custard stands (Gilles'; Kopp's; Leon's), but I travel to Charlotte frequently, and when I need a fix, it's nice to know Culver's is near.  Note:  It's not ice cream, it's frozen custard, and it's AWESOME in any presentation:  Sundae; shake or malt or concrete mixer; or plain in a cone or bowl.  
Outside of the frozen custard, Culver's food in general is hit & miss.  Sometimes the burger patty is great, sometimes it has been squashed and seared within an inch of its life.  Sometimes the chicken tenders are juicy, sometimes overcooked and dry.  Sometimes the fish is moist and flaky; sometimes greasy.  The service is always attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I had a good burger and salad here, though I have been to a number of Culver's many times (mostly in Milwaukee area), and Culver's food can be somewhat inconsistent compared to other national fast food chains. Excellent and friendly service, which I experience at every location.  And of course the frozen custard is great."}
{"text":"Love their butter burgers and fries.  They have great root beer too--diet and regular. My favorite is the custard--chocolate is delicious alone or vanilla is best with turtle toppings--turtle sundae turtle concrete or anything with hot fudge, caramel, and pecans."}
{"text":"I went to a Culver's in Wisconsin and I remember it being yummy. We were in Peoria and drove about 20 minutes to come here only to be disappointed. Fish sandwich was blah.. the bread was not very good. maybe we should have had the butter burger?"}
{"text":"This is like the 3rd time this location has forgotten my large fry but charged me for it. Annoyed"}
{"text":"Really annoyed at the incident that happened tonight and I'm sure I will never see Culver's the same way or even be back! Let's just say I should have gone to Chick-fil-a down the street for better customer service, where if they mess up my order at least I'm satisfied with the great customer service. So I ordered thru the drive thru at 7:22pm two burgers and two kids meal with vanilla custard. Not a complicated order right? and I know mistakes happen. I'm down the street when I decided to check my order and the kids meals didn't have the fries so I turn around to get my fries. Went thru the drive thru again to let the staff know (at this point a long line), they grabbed my kids meal bags and stood their for a minute staring at my kids burgers like are you sure we didn't put fries in there?? WTH! At this point my two kids custards are melted we're in Arizona we're even in he evening it's hot, so I asked if they can remake the custards. So they must of called supervisor or manager whatever he was didn't catch him name, which I should have because his customer service sucked. He came to the window and was like we will bring out your fries and get you new custards. I don't know how to describe his attitude towards me but it was as if I was an inconvenience to him for going back for my correct order and new custard. He took one of the custards and threw it away in front of us and then my daughter asked if she could keep the second one since they are throwing it away. I then asked the staff member if I could keep the second custard since he was tossing them and he's like no I gotta have it back so I handed it to him and BAM he threw it away right in front of us. To top it off yes he gave me the french fries they forgot to place in the kids meals and replaced the melted custards, but it must of bothered him I went back because their was like 7 french fries in bag and the replaced swirl of custard was very small with hardly any sprinkles. Very upset at the way they handled this situation with the attitude. Didn't even enjoy our food when I got home because I was sooo upset and of course the rest of the order was cold. Paid at 7:22pm and left Culver's at 7:42pm. 20min in total!"}
{"text":"Culver's greets you with the line \"What can we make fresh for you today?\" and they mean it.

Consistently is key. In my experience, this Culver's has it. The burgers are fresh and really flavorful, the tenders are fresh and fried well. When I'm wanting some quick fast food drive-thru fare, it's never a risk to go through Culver's. Other fast food joints are a crap shoot especially when it comes to fresh fries/nuggets! Automation can't come soon enough for places.

Once in a blue moon they might give you a trash chicken tendie, or forget to put an item in your bag. It's usually when you can see the employees being a little more rowdy than usual (days the boss isn't around?) but Culver's is definitely leagues better than every other fast food chain out there, where you're wasting money on hours old junk more than 50% of the time.

Back to the food, I'm a big fan of pretty much their entire menu. My regular, the Culver's deluxe double, is an A+ fast food burger. They offer a good variety of burgers aren't your jam- chicken and fish sandwiches, plus fried chicken and beef pot roast dinner plates. They also offer gluten free buns by way of the Udi's brand!

Honestly their fried Atlantic cod is surprisingly good- with tender yet crispy lightweight batter, and flaky buttery fish. Large portion too. You wouldn't expect to find good fish and chips type fare at a fast food burger place but there it is. Their custard is my favorite ice cream from anywhere. So velvety smooth! Italian ice with fresh fruit is lovely too.

Very glad I'm near a Culver's- one of the only places doing fast food right!"}
{"text":"Our food took a little longer than normal today and when the food runner came by they offered me a free mixer for our wait. Great service."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch when driving from Chicago to Minneapolis.  Conveniently located right off the highway.  Plenty of parking available.

We had the puppy with us so one of us had to stay outside in bitter cold with him.  When they found out that we had a dog with us they made sure to give us dog biscuit with our order for him.   We both (hubby and I, not puppy terror) had a burger and a malt.  I had a vanilla malt and hubby chocolate.  Mine was very good and puppy terror enjoyed licking my straw when I was finished.  Puppy terror approved as well.  Burgers were hot and fresh.  Everything tasted great and hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I go to Culver's once in a while but not too often.  They usually have good soups.  Today I went through the drive through and ordered George's Chili (although I don't know who George is) and a side salad.  The Chili was good but not as good as \"Lisa's\" Chili.  The side salad was very small but all in all it was a good meal.  The drive through was quick and the people working were friendly."}
{"text":"Having culvers for the first time and I don't know why their burgers are popular....my burger patties are like burnt crackers. Awful. This place was recommended highly for the \"amazing butter burgers\"  Not even close. Soo disappointed."}
{"text":"Culver's has some good burgers! I'd say this is easily one of the top 5 burger joints in my book. Try the chedder butter burger and cheese curds! Service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I tried Culver's for the first time today. I ordered the battered cod dinner to take home.  The fries were overcooked, the batter on the fish fell off when I picked it up, the lemon wedge had no juice in it whatsoever - totally dry!  The good thing is the coleslaw is one of the best I have had, but this meal was not worth $10.00.  Return business is doubtful right now."}
{"text":"Love Culver's! I fill up easily on the kids menu- so that's my go-to. The frozen custard is super good- and you can customize the toppings to your favorite combination. Tastes a lot more fresh than many competing 'fast food' spots."}
{"text":"2.5  stars the food was blah nothing special but the ice cream was good. Definitely a dessert only place"}
{"text":"WOW! Two thumbs up! I'm a fan! Tried the mushroom swiss burger, cheese curds & a caramel cement mixer. The burger was amazing. You can tell it was cooked over an open flame. Had that wonderful chargrilled taste. The burgers will come plain so if you want extras like lettuce, mayo, etc I'm guessing you would have to ask. Never had I enjoyed a plain burger so much, it doesn't need all that extra stuff if you ask me. The taste of the beef mushrooms & swiss alone was enough to keep me happy. The cheese curds were out of this world! I could eat a vat of the cheese curds. They are a must have when you go. There is also a huge selection of custards, shakes, pies, cakes and other sweets. Just looking at the selection of mix ins could send you into a diabetic coma. 
The restaurant itself was very clean, including the bathrooms and the staff was super freindly. In fact I was asking my husband what he thought a particularly yummy desert was in the freezer as a staff member was walking by. She happily informed me it was a brownie explosion cake. 
I would definately go again, in fact I could kick myself for not going sooner. Culvers will be my fast food burger place from now on."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers and sides.  The milk shakes are excellent.  The prices are way too high.  $12 for a basket seems expensive."}
{"text":"Love the butterburgers and cheese curds here!! A must go for a good burger and very decently priced. Always made to order so you know its fresh. The bacon is cooked to perfection and makes a nice crunch. Just how I like it!! Had to sub the curds for the fries, but that's not a problem with a cheese loving kid like myself!!! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Culver's. Being originally from Wisconsin I'm so happy to visit this place when I'm in town as there are none where I live in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"my husband and i love culvers and last nite was the first time we were disappointed. it appears that the tuna melt i love has been removed from the menu first of all. i only had it there less than a month ago. when my husband asked about the tuna melt noone seemed to know what he was talking about? if its only been removed that recently you would think SOMEONE would know what he was talking about. after he explained what it was they made it for him (i wasnt with him). however they hardly put any tuna on it and forgot the cheese. and if they still have tuna then why are they telling people they no longer make it?? he said that the people at the counter did not have a clue. VERY disappointing to say the least. they need to put it back on the menu!"}
{"text":"Frozen custard is so good it's a sin, and you'll have to confess the next day. And Culver's is the best.

I love it with bits of reeses peanut butter cups and peanut butter mixed in. Topped with warm caramel. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Burgers are just OK. Ice cream was very good but I'm not sure that all their ingredients are very fresh? Some pieces tasted a bit off. Probably won't come back here again."}
{"text":"Wanted a good burger before attending a musical at The Gammage. Would have gone anywhere... paid any price. Planned on an upscale eatery and then noticed the new Culvers on Southern. I remembered how good they are! Burger was not a disappointment! They give enough meat to be juicy yet crisp along the edges so full of flavor. The buns were fresh and buttery. I asked for fries extra crisp and they were. I had a great meal in a new, clean establishment. I saved a lot of money and loved my meal!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, service and clean environment!  My grandma and I eat out every Tuesday night and she had coupons for a place called, \"Culver's\".  It had burgers so I was game.  We had double cheeseburgers, fries and drinks.  She also got the cement shakes, or whatever they were called and loved them.  The burger was really tasty and the fries were nice and hot!  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  It had a large, clean dinning area and seemed to be family friendly. They also had TVs for the guys!  I have already told several friends about this place and I only had it last night for the first time! I say that would warrent a \"woohoo\"!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Culver's restaurants for years.  I am from the Midwest, so I'm very familiar with Wisconsin cheese and dairy products, etc.  I have to say, this Culver's is by far the most beautiful, cleanest, and well-staffed of them all.  

The experience was positive from the moment I walked in the door and was greeted by a smiling employee.  I ordered a reuben sandwich with cheese curds and a milkshake.  Everything was delivered hot (or cold, in the case of my milkshake), fresh and promptly to our table.  The employee even offered to bring us cups of water!  I was also very impressed with management, as they stopped by our table to ask how our experience had been.  Three thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very unhappy with service. They got our icecream order wrong. They took back our order that we paid for and made us pay to get it right.  Very bad manager. Will not go back"}
{"text":"I love Culver's food it's awesome 
This location always messes up my order so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars, I always have to wait more than I should for my food
The menu is pricey for what you get"}
{"text":"Another trip to Scottsdale, another stop At Culver's. The food is okay and a fair price. The best part about this location is it is never busy and the service is great."}
{"text":"Just there this past weekend after the big win over Nebraska. Good as it gets!! Best fast food burgers by far. I have yet to eat a sundae or any type of ice cream that tops this place. Mouth is watering just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I love Culver's.  I grew up in Wisconsin so Culver's is in my blood.  Before we moved here I had to visit my parents or my in laws to satisfy a Culver's craving, now they're all over the valley and we live in Phoenix now!

This Culver's had a rough start.  We came with friends in December and it was SLOW.  30 minute wait at least for our food.  February was a different story and everything arrived much more quickly.

My only recent complaint was that I ordered the flavor of the day custard \"chocolate oreo volcano\" (a family favorite).  And what it seems I actually received was 'oreo overload'.  I would double check on some of the servers' knowledge of what the flavor of the day ingredients are.

Other than that, a solid location, now that they've got their feet under them."}
{"text":"I really like the butter burger.  It's a old style of food that reminds me when I was a kid."}
{"text":"I honestly was surprised this was more than a 'burger joint'.  I live right around the corner from this Culver's and my first thought was, \"What do we need with another In N Out, McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, etc. in our neighborhood, ugh\"?  

But the first time I actually went inside I was pleasantly surprised at the more restaurant-like atmosphere.  My family and I sat at a clean large double open booth and had an array of comfort food, from a beef pot roast sandwich, their famous butter burgers and cheese curds, and my favorite -- a mushroom burger with grilled onions.  I haven't been able to get a mushroom burger forever!!  We even had a fried chicken breast (hefty) and mashed potato with chicken gravy dinner along with fish and chips - lightly battered (like a tempura) with malt vinegar and tartar sauce.  We were eating each other's meals just to try everything.  The fries were just like I like it (or I'd avoid fries because so often they're cold or overcooked).  These are crinkle cut, hot and lightly crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside, not hard through and through like McDonald's are often.

So much I haven't tried yet on the menu, because you tend to stick with favorites, but I also plan to try the fried shrimp and the Reuben.  Occasionally I have a soup or salad there, also good.  But the custard they make each day...?  Really, really creamy, love it.   Have to stay away from that...

I do not think you can be disappointed unless you are highly critical."}
{"text":"Went there the other day with high hopes of their burgers...was very let down. I feel I could've gotten a better tasting, more flavorful, less chard burger across the street. Their lemon ice is amazing though, and the kids love their single scoop ice cream, so I'll give them that. But very disappointed from all the great things I had heard prior."}
{"text":"So I'd heard of Culver's, but never eaten there until this one opened up. Wow oh wow, what a great place! I've now been there 3 or 4 times and really dig their burgers!!! The Onion Rings were totally awesome too!  I even went for the Vanilla frozen custard (actually, I ate some of my daughter's).  I usually get the bacon cheese butter burger and what a fresh, well put together burger. Dopety dope, guess who'll be back pretty soon? This guy!"}
{"text":"I had never had a Culver's burger prior to their opening in Avondale.  They are definitely good burgers, but are a bit too greasy for my liking.  Haven't been inside the restaurant yet, having only used the drive through, but will say that the drive through was quick and they have pull ahead spots designed for those times when your order may be a little slow so they don't block up the window.  We had a Wisconsin Swiss Melt meal and a Butter Burger with bacon meal (I can't remember the exact name of the sandwich) and they were very hot and fresh though a bit too \"buttery\" for me.  The fries are decent, but I must admit to liking In-N-Out's fries better.  But if you are looking for a good hamburger that is different from the typical chains, I would recommend this place.  We will go back again soon."}
{"text":"We look forward to Culver's anytime we're in AZ.  Custard is awesome here, cheese curds rock.  Ranks top 5 in hamburgers I've ever had. Customer service is always top notch!!!"}
{"text":"This location: 
customer service, meh ( it's a hit or miss) 
Food, meh

My biggest complaint is that where the cashier tells you where to pull up after you order there isn't enough room. When people pull away after receiving their food I'm constantly worried someone is going to knock off my rear view mirror and vice versa. Not all locations are like this though 

Other than that, 
The ice cream is super yummy and their root beer float is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Stopped on our way through.  I have never been to a Culvers but noticed they were the local big shot.  That being said, I had heard of a Wisconsin butter burger, so it was time to try it out.

The out side of the location was very well maintained.  We did go through the drive through so I can not speak to the interior.

We placed an order with an friendly and helpful voice.  Once we paid we were asked to pull forward, so they not pre-made.  They were brought out to the car.  Only took a couple of minutes.  The burgers were fantastic.  Hot and juicy.  The buns were grilled, soft and melt in your mouth.  If I lived in the area, I would prefer this to 5 guys."}
{"text":"Worst Culvers I have ever been to. Cold and overcooked fries.  Bacon Cheeseburger cold, smothered in mayo and Bread was like a hockey puck. Returned it to remake.

I will never return to this location again."}
{"text":"Love Culver's! The staff is so friendly and helpful, never rude and they don't rush you when they are busy. Great specials everyday! Try the cheese curds, Ruben sandwich, and a concrete mixer. Don't forget to try their root beer as well."}
{"text":"Fast food for sure 
Was unable to enjoy as the food was served somewhat hot and lost all taste quickly
Doubt we will return
Tried the Culver's in buckeye and same story"}
{"text":"Oh the butterburgers and the concretes. Got to love the frozen custard concretes. That you can mix in any two things you want from there list of many. Inside tip: They also have chocolate custard not just vanilla. This I found out after a few visits. I always get chocolate custard with chocolate sauce and Oreo cookies. I think its the best.
The burgers are really good. So are the onion rings and the cheese curds. I have never heard of cheese curds before Culvers. Must be a Wisconsin thing but they are really good. To call them fried cheese balls don't do them justice. Just try them. If you like cheese you will like these.
The service is pretty good. Sure it takes awhile to get your food but that just means they are making it fresh. For that I am willing to wait. Plus they give you your concrete first so you can enjoy that while you pull forward in the drive thru to wait for the rest of your order. They give you a number and then bring out your food right to your car.
It is a little expensive to eat more than once a week but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"We stop at 9:30 pm to eat, and at 10:00 pm they turn off all the lights of the dining area! It was like 4 groups of different people eating at the same time.  Me and my husband and my baby of 4 month were force to leave the restaurant with food in our hands because it was closing time! Very rude attitude of their management."}
{"text":"I ordered a concrete mixer with peanut butter & Heath bar.  It was good.  Too much peanut butter though.  Sizes are big shoo I got a Short cup which was the right size for any ice cream lover. 

My son got the concrete mixer with sprinkles & brownie pieces.  He loved it and he usually only orders cookie dough.  He said there was a lit off sprinkles & they were frozen hard.  It gave just the right amount of crunch. 

Spouse ordered the fudge pecan 2 scoop sunde.  He loved it.  Just the right amount of fudge & sweetness."}
{"text":"Tried the Colby Jack Pub Burger, YUM*, very tasty will fer sure get it again. Service was first rate, I was there around 9 pmish."}
{"text":"I LOVE Culvers food.... However, at this location I had a discrepency with my coupon and the owner Gary Landreth was absolutely rude to me and would not honor the coupon. I will never return to this location. He needs to learn what customer service is if he expects to keep customers long term... He said horrible and judgemental things to me and about me. I will never return."}
{"text":"Used to be very friendly and clean. That has gone out the window with careless order taking and sloppy cleanup. 3 different times our orders have been mixed up and had to be redone, resulting in waiting double the amount of time without apology. I avoid this location now."}
{"text":"It is extremely dangerous to have this Culver's within close proximity of where I live!  I was kind of hoping there would be some colossal reason I hated going here so I wouldn't frequent it, but alas, there is none.

I don't know who did the training for the staff here, but they did an amazing job.  Every time I'm here, the staff are super helpful, friendly, and SUPER polite.  They know how to remain calm and treat customers right if something is out of sorts.  I just always know I will be met with a warm welcome and a \"I'm happy to help you\" attitude, rather than making me feel like an annoyance (as I have experienced from other places).  Tonight, in particular, I took my turn too sharp while moving to the waiting area and hit the curb with my truck.  When the gentleman who dropped off my food came to my car, he told me, \"I saw you bumped the curb earlier.  I just wanted you to know that your tire looks like it's ok!\"  I thought it was very sweet and helpful (because I was worried about my tire).

I don't usually have to wait very long for my orders either inside or through the drive thru.  

The building is beautiful and modern (it's still a pretty new structure) and the inside is kept clean, too.

I mean....  Culver's food and custard is delicious no matter how you slice it, but the above par service will keep us coming back to this location in particular!"}
{"text":"Culvers is a treat. Gives you that 'hell yeah' feeling once you walk inside and see the massive colorful menu. Everything from their famous butter burgers, to ice cream and the eat-in experience is clean and spacious with flat screens. This spot originated in Wisconsin and is not found in all states, making it that much better. I recommend you add bacon to any style burger. Drive-thu is available, and bulk ice cream for purchase. The only reason they don't get 5 is because the employee interaction is a bit awkward and sometimes slow. Comparable to a  lesser version of steakn'shake if you have been to the Midwest, but even being in that same ballpark makes Culvers a great spot to indulge."}
{"text":"Great food. Fats service. Clean dining area. The chicken salad sandwich didn't come out like it looked in the picture, it was still good though. Not was I was expecting. But I gave 5 stars because the food was good regardless."}
{"text":"Worst chicken strips ever ! I saw the commercial that they have organically raised chicken but their chickens tastes like power and not fresh at all. Horrible !"}
{"text":"Frozen custard called concrete with two mix ins and 3- 5 Monday to Friday buy one get one.  Have special blends of the day.  The service is slow, the music playing is loud and the my custard was on 3/4 filled and only blended on the top.  Cause it was happy hour, it served it's purpose."}
{"text":"Discovered Culvers on a road/business trip in 2012. After seeing six dozen signs from the time we hit the  Wisconsin border (from Illinois) bragging of the world famous butter burger, I decided to stop at the one in Madison, where I would be spending the next few evenings of work at. Granted, by the time I rolled into Culvers in Madison, I'd been on the road virtually non stop (minus  gas fill ups) for the better part of 17 hours and hadn't ate in well over 24, so I entered the establishment quite a bit hungry. I decided to try out the butter burger for myself to see if it was as good as advertised.  Rare is food BETTER than advertised, however this burger was far and away better. I was hooked. Unfortunately, where I lived was quite a distance from a Culvers, so I chalked it up to a one shot deal. However, much to my pleasant surprise, the day I arrived back in Arizona to relocate back here, I passed this Culvers. I nearly did a 360 to get into the parking lot. After spending a year plus bragging how good the hamburgers were here, my wife was likely sick of hearing it and when I ordered, short of it tasting like gold, she wouldn't believe for herself how good Culvers is. Then she ate one and was as hooked as I. We are frequent visitors here now. The burgers are off the chain and customer service is always great. Won't eat burgers anywhere else (trust me I've tried, and I'm lucky to  be able to stomach a few bites). Culvers is without peers in the fast food industry."}
{"text":"Culver's your food is always so amazing! This review isn't about the food it's about the employees you have working at this location. Young boys with terrible mouths on them. Standing up at the counter ordering our family dinner with my 7 year old son and 4 year old daughter and the two boys getting food on trays both said the F word and then one of them said something was Bull S@$!. Not quite about it. Very loud. I'm not one to shelter my kids against bad words I mean we all say them but there is a time and place to use those words and being at work isn't one of them. I do have to say our cashier also a young man did apologize for the language because it was just that loud that it interrupted our conversation. Maybe have a chat with them to watch their language. The amount of older folks in there one of them might start pulling some ears and getting some bars of soap  to rinse out their mouths."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the ice cream and onion rings since I am a vegetarian. They have very good sundaes  and shakes.  If you decide to get a malt tell them to go easy on the malt powder they tend to do it 50/50 which is way too much for anyone.  The restaurant is new so it's clean and they have a good sized patio to enjoy the AZ weather.  The staff on my visits have always been very  nice and helpfull.  In our group they even made up a free shake for us to try that wasn't on the menu without charge. I had a surrogate tester try the butter burger and he gave it an enthusiastic thumbs up.  So if I ever go back to the dark side I will re-review with a burger addition.

Try:
- carmel/cashew sundae
- Shakes
- Malts ( Go easy on the malt )
- * Butter Burger 

* Surrogate Tester Approved"}
{"text":"It's a fast food place, albeit a high end fast food place. Good food, never had a problem with service. little pricey, but it is good."}
{"text":"I normally don't frequent fast food establishments often, however this past weekend we were famished after car shopping for 6 hours and needed a quick bite.  Since this new location is close to home, we thought we should give it a whirl, and boy am I glad we did.

First off, the bathrooms were quite possibly the cleanest I've ever seen at a fast food joint and the decor was nice and clean as well (probably cause it's brand new, but still).  I had a deluxe burger and onion rings and also sampled the cheese curds and strawberry shake my Husband had.  Oh my... the cheese curds and shake are to die for!  So good.  As for the burger- it was very good, maybe a bit salty, but not quite as good as In-n-out (in my opinion).  Either way, I know we will be back for those cheese curd and the shakes.  We were also excited to see the custard cakes and oreo cookies with custard... OMG I bet those are good.

For a fast food place, Culvers offers some unique items when you're in the mood for breaking the diet."}
{"text":"Having a snickers Mini cement ice cream , very good, busy store so everyone is out enjoying dinner tonight.
Just ice cream for us tonight"}
{"text":"Love this place for a Fast Food alternative. 

Great burgers!! And love the custard. 

Nice change from the usual fast food."}
{"text":"I'm pretty excited to have a Culver's nearby! Their burgers and custard are family faves and this location certainly does not disappoint! It's super refreshing when a fast food place offers excellent service, a clean facility and good food! I have been visiting this location about once a week since they opened and on all except one occasion every part of my order was correct. The one time that they made a mistake it was rectified quickly with a smile. These guys are doing a great job, highly recommend for any family looking for a quick, reliable meal!"}
{"text":"Always happy with the service at this location.  My expectations for Culvers service is high and they are consistently good"}
{"text":"Yum! Frozen Custard! I've been dreaming of it since I got back from a visit to Green Bay last summer ;)

I was excited to hear that Culver's opened here in Mesa -- I don't eat their burgers, but it' s nice to have a place for frozen custard -- there are so few places for any type of frozen dessert in Phoenix (which is odd, considering how hot it is) and there are even fewer places for custard.
When I went to Culver's last weekend, I had the  peanut butter cup custard -- it was delicious. My husband didn't really see the difference between custard and ice cream, so I had to give him the custard speech: It's really different! First of all, custard is so creamy, when you jab your spoon in it, it just sticks there. Custard won't even fall off your spoon. And it has a much more egg-y flavor, probably because there is more butterfat and more egg yolks in custard than in ice-cream. There's also a lot less air in custard, making it denser than ice cream. 

While Culver's was never my FAVORITE place for custard when I lived in Wisconsin, I have a lot of fond memories of hanging out at the place in high school, and I'm glad to see it brought here to the Valley."}
{"text":"For situations like these, I wish Yelp had an option to rate the food/product separately from the service. This location had excellent service, but the food was absolutely disgusting, however, that's because the food at every Culver's is disgusting, and not any fault of the employees.

The burgers are drowning in grease, are super thin and flavorless, and make the buns soggy quickly. There's nothing I hate more than a soggy bun. Urgh. The pickles are also sweeter pickles, which I'm not a huge fan of. The fries were not at all crisp, which is another down side. 

That said, the service was excellent. We'd eaten at a Culver's once before and didn't like the food, but we thought we'd give a new location another try. Not being familiar with how the chain works, the counter lady was kind and explained things to us and was just very friendly. So was the gal who brought our food to us. So they were excellent!

I just don't get the appeal of Culver's food and shan't be going back again. If I want flavorless fast food, I'll go somewhere cheaper and less greasy."}
{"text":"First time trying out Culver's and was pretty impressed. I have the double bacon deluxe and I dont even have anything negative to say about it. Good flavor and did not taste frozen. Sadly there arent any locations around me so I will have to go to the new Queen Creek location. Super excited to try out the custard next time!!"}
{"text":"Way, way, overpriced, burgers are not that good. The bread is way too thick, patty is too salty. The ice cream is good, and the shakes but they're not anything better than Any other ice cream place. Drive-thru was quick, that's it. Will not return, almost 20 bucks for a kids meal and a burger VALUE meal... Ha!"}
{"text":"Grand Opening at Culver's! Of course it gets 5 stars because I'm one of the hundreds of people who, for some reason, found this a very exciting event on a Monday. Outdoor seating! A view of the Chik-fil-a scross the mall parking lot! A really big, bright, menu! What more could you want? And if you eat too much and get a terrible brain freeze, it's right by urgent care.

It will take a few weeks to see how they keep the place up, but c'mon, it's Culver, you know it's going to be awesome."}
{"text":"After going to Dairy Queen and being told they don't cook food 10 till close. We showed up here, very glad we did. Food is always hot and delicious and the drive thru lady is very sweet. Good job Culver's"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the chicken tenders! By far my favorite of all their options. Plus, they have the GOOD root beer and Custard! Nom nom. The peanut butter + Reese's cups concrete mixer is the best! 10/10"}
{"text":"Great burgers and their fries are good as well.  The staff is friendly and the inside is clean.  I like how they bring the food to your table.  My only complaint is how you wait in a parking spot when going through the drive thru.  Maybe they can find a way to be more efficient with this.  Small issue aside this is where I'll go when I want a burger.  Almost as good as meatheads or five guys."}
{"text":"We're talking fast food here but I still give it 5 stars.  Every Culver's I go into is consistently good and the menu is unique for fast food.  Best of all I am not repulsed by the thought of their employees touching my food, they hire good people."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Culver's restaurant. My first observation was the outside area, it was clean and litter free with ample parking. The inside was also very clean and neat, as was the bathroom.  The owner of the store personally took my order and he was friendly and very professional. I ordered the \"Culvers Deluxe\" platter, which included fries and a drink. The double meat, double cheese burger came piled high with bacon and fresh veggies. The burger was excellent, hot and plenty of juice. Fries were ok, crispy, could have been more of them. Overall, prices are about average for a burger combo. The food was above average for a fast food joint. The staff was friendly and helpful. I give Culver's a thumbs up and I am sure I will visit them again."}
{"text":"Standard Culver's location, but that's in no way a bad thing. Great burgers and curds as always."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location a few times now and so far it's been pretty good. I am pretty easy to please but I can't give 5 stars due to some lack of communication I've experienced here. I have been very specific on my toppings and then the employee would read back a totally different order then what I said as of they weren't even listening. To top it off when I tried to correct her she seemed to get short with me. Maybe it was just me and how I perceived it. On the up side though the cooks have yet to let me down!"}
{"text":"I love there hamburgers! So dang good, also there cheese Curds are good. If you like ice cream you will like there's too!! So good I get the M&M custard. I've had a couple of times getting the wrong order but that's about it;) I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good burger and fries and the entire family enjoyed their meal. We went late, around 9:00pm and it was very busy so we were glad we were not there during the dinner rush.

One complaint is after we ate our meal and on our way out we went to the counter to order some frozen custard to go. She took our order and we paid and they she stood there looking at me. I asked, do we get a number and she said \"no, just stand against the wall and they will call you when it is ready\". She had not taken my name or anything so I asked her \"how are they going to call me, they don't have my name?\" and she said, \"they will call out your order\". So, we stood in line with the other 15 people and each time an order was ready it was a cluster with people trying to figure out if the order being called was actually there's or someone else's. They continuously had to go through the entire order so people could figure out if that was their order which slowed down the entire process and made the front of the place a zoo.

I highly recommend they come up with a better way to call out orders so people know if it is their order being called out. It would be as easy as giving each customer an order number that is called out when it is ready."}
{"text":"Last Wednesday was my first time here. Place was very clean, attentive & friendly staff. Had the Double Deluxe Burger and a chocolate shake. Burger was just above fast food average, crinkle fries ordinary, chocolate shake was splendid, and the cheese curds were great. Would I go back? Heck yeah!"}
{"text":"Took 20+ minutes to get through the drive thru to get a chicken sandwich and a cheeseburger. Not cool. Not a single word of \"sorry for the wait\". Expensive and mediocre and SLOW."}
{"text":"This location is by far the worst I have ever been! Always takes forever and they served me burnt onion rings! They show no respect for thier customers or place of business and I will never go back."}
{"text":"First timer here. The food was a tiny bit on the salty side (and I have a high salt tolerance), but the meat portion compared to the bun was incredible. The crinkled fries were hot and fresh, and the dine-in lobby was kept very clean. I was really surprised this place wasn't as populated as In-N-Out; The Culver's Deluxe was above par in comparison to In-N-Out's Double-Double. Will definitely be making future stops here in the future."}
{"text":"As mentioned in my review of the Tempe location, Culver's Deluxe burger was delicious though just a bit on the salty side. Chili cheese fries are the best in the valley now that Carl's Jr. took the item off their menu, and the Culver's brand root beer from the fountain is comparable to A&W's. Employees here were friendly, and the environment is definitely great for families -- they have some nice positive bible quotes painted on the walls. Minus one star because of the dirty restroom."}
{"text":"Well it is a good thing that the food taste good and the concrete was good too. The reason I say this is because you have to watch when you order and when you are eating very closely. I place my order gave the cashier my money. I gave them the correct coin but the dollars was more. This way I could get just dollars back. Well that was mess. Even the cash register toll them what to give me back just dollars and no coins, they were confused. I almost just walk out. The other part while I was eating my meal they have people going around and picking up your trash. Nice but I wasn't finish eating yet. I place my burger down so I could take a drink. They wanted to take my tray. The other item I didn't like they gave me my desert before my meal... So it melted while I ate my meal. Will I come back... I guess I will give them another try."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how horrible everything from the beginning to end was! First, we told the worker that we wanted a number two. She sarcastically said that she did not know what a number 2 was because there are no numbers there. I am sure that on a daily basis, she gets people referring to them by numbers, but she proceeded to pretend like she did not know what we were ordering. I don't understand why she could not figure out that it was the 2nd value meal on their menu. Then, when we get to the window, they are out of the drink that we want. They asked what else we wanted so we said a shake. Then, she said they would have to charge more for the shake. We asked why they would charge us extra when they could not fulfill what we wanted in the first place. The least they could have done is given us the shake at no extra cost for the inconvenience. Next, they gave us Pepsi because it was our 2nd choice. They clearly did not mix the syrup with the other stuff correctly. It tasted awful. Just like carbonated water. We told them and they replaced it with another Pepsi that tasted exactly the same. The French fries were old and cold and the bread was soggy. Last, they told us to pull over so they could bring us our order because even though we were the only car in the drive-through, they could not get our order done on time. The reason why this is strange is because I could tell that the fries were not fresh. What took so long then? The boy who brought out our meal told us, \"I don't know what to tell you,\" when we told him that the fries were cold, the Pepsi was awful, and the girl in the drive-through was rude. I will never return to this place again. The reason why I am putting my review here is because I put it on the website survey and asked for the manager to call me. I even gave my phone number and my name. I never received a call. I am so disappointed. This was my 1st time visiting a Culvers and it was definitely not the experience I expected. It's not an experience I expect from any restaurant trying to stay in business."}
{"text":"This is some delicious midwestern fast food.  They have, or once had, the greatest fried fish sandwich with tartar sauce and grated cheddar cheese. OMG, what a treat. My compadre ordered the fish and chips, but they didn't have any malt vinegar, so he walked down to Perkin's down the street and brought back a bottle. Hilarious it was. And of course, no trip to this place is complete without a scoop of frozen custard to make sure you are good and ill."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty darn good!  Everything I have ordered there has been perfectly made so far.  I've stuck to getting the double cheeseburger combo, and Culver's has been consistent so far.  

The cheese curds are a perfect side.  

People might complain a little about the prices, but I'm pretty sure the prices at Culver's are still cheaper that a place like Carl's Jr.'s.  

My daughters love that the kids meals come with frozen custard.

Culver's customer service is at the top of the food chain.  Go there and find out for yourself.  

I couldn't find a single reason to deduct a point."}
{"text":"I felt like having something finger licking good tonight and KFC doesn't  cut it...so I decided to get some fast food which I normally  don't. ...it just isn't worth  it. 

So....I was driving  by and Culver's  caught  me eye. I drove through  the  drive thru and I saw CHICKEN !! on the menu. I placed  my order of 8 pieces and the squawk  box had to ask if there were 8 pieces  of chicken  and her response  was yes.

When I picked it up I asked the guy at the window if it was fresh and his  response  was yes...only about 30 to 45 minutes  out of the fryer. I got home and what a surprise  I got....dry, old, frigging chicken. Another disappointment  in my life.

I called Culver's  and asked to speak to someone  about the order and the female that answered  told me she could help....she was so sorry but not as much  as I was because  I just spent $15 on a dry old chick.

She took my info and told me someone will return my call...but in the meantime  Im stuck with the worse chicken  I ever had, even if it had been fresh it was still tasteless.  

Stick to your burgers and sandwiches and keep your  old dry chicken  as a tax write  off for a business  lose. 

Cluck you Culver's  for crappy  chicken."}
{"text":"Butter burger and vanilla frozen custard.  'Nuff said!"}
{"text":"We come here solely for their custards.  It's delicious and quite caloric.  Did  I say delicious?  Good service, too.  Very polite staff.  The rest of their food is OK.  Probably more like 3 stars but I generally am not a fan of fast food."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best!  They help out my son's school by doing fundraisers where our school gets 20% back on the sales for the day using coupons.  The staff is always so nice, friendly and efficient.  The food is so fresh and the Butter burger is to die for as well as their ice cream.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Never been and kept hearing about it! Culver's was right on the corner by my hotel so I thought I would give it a try. They were very nice and told me all about the menu when they found out I had never been. They also gave me a sample of the frozen custard. My favorite part was the frozen custard mixed with some oreos. I had a patty melt and some cheese curds. They were both good. The burger was very greasy but it was good. Just not healthy! I will be back to give them a try and have some more of the frozen custard for sure!"}
{"text":"Best malts ever. Especially when added banana and brownies. When I first had a butter burger here I thought it was absolutely delicious. Now I can't even eat therr, there food is just so greasy it makes my stomach ache. But they do have delicious fries."}
{"text":"Burgers and custards are great and did I mention she sell fried cheese curd balls .  It man... they are SUPER EXPensive. I don't recommend taking you kids. It will cost a small fortune. Just you and your spouse should be fine. I do like getting their coupons in the mail that's really the only way I'll go."}
{"text":"Everytime I am in the Midwest I go for a Culvers burger. There is something comforting about downing their butter burger...and who doesn't love that they have Diet Mt Dew on the menu. That is the Midwest for you.

Everything was A-OK and if I had to eat a fast food burger this would be my go to place."}
{"text":"Always fresh hamburgers and piping-hot crinkle-cut fries. The frozen custard is great. Very friendly service and clean. They have great coupons."}
{"text":"Delicious custard, good service.  Their regular food is OK.  Super greasy, super not good for you.  Neither is the custard but everybody needs a guilty pleasure!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of burgers and fried foods but I have to say, their cheese curds are pretty darn good ... and their custard ice cream is heavenly!!  

Good service, patriotic decor, and they do a great job keeping the place clean.  Definitely a nice place for a treat!"}
{"text":"I only comes in once a year for my birthday specials.  The menu prices here are fairly high and super expensive for my taste.  But I do enjoy the way they cook and prepare your food.  Good place for \"actual\" fresh hot food."}
{"text":"I gave Culver's another shot. I wanted to see if they could convince me that they can earn more stars but I think 3 stars is where they will stay. 

I had their chicken dinner tonight and got a flashback to cafeteria-style school lunches. The  meal comes with 2 pieces of fried chicken, a choice of 2 sides (I chose mash and green beans) and a roll.

The green beans were flavor-less, the mash was less than good, the roll was cold and Fry's had better fried chicken. 

The only thing that saved the night was the frozen custard. Always a treat. I had the caramel cashew tonight. Yum Yum."}
{"text":"I was searching for a place that served cheese curds last night and Culvers popped up as being the \"highest ranking\" place with them. Do NOT go here for the cheese curds!! Especially if you've ever had good ones at San Tan Flats, A&W or even Buffalo Wild Wings. I don't like the breading they put on them here - they tasted more like a bad mozzarella stick than a curd. Not a fan.

I did like my burger. Fries were OK - not my favorite and I don't think I'd get them again. My husband's chicken strips were good - just pricey! I also liked how their place is set up. They have an area to order (with a HUGE) menu, and then a separate dining area. It makes it feel more like a sit down restaurant then fast food which is nice.

The custard was SO good!! I got the flavor of the day (toffee pecan) and I'd come back just for it again!! 

Be sure to sign up for their e-mail and text club. I got a BOGO deal and a free scoop of ice cream off their yelp check in offer too! Made it under $18 for the 3 of us."}
{"text":"I must say Culver's goes above and beyond for customers. That being said I've witnessed customers abuse the teenagers working there. Last time I was there I saw a grown man yelling at a teen girl who was trying to do everything she could to please this customer. He called her names and yelled and was given free food and a scoop of custard. 

Shame on you customers who let out your day on these kids working part time jobs busting their butts. I would like to say Tanasia was amazing at being kind, professional, and accommodating. I am just sorry there are jerks who let their day out on these kids."}
{"text":"My lunch hour was near this culvers, single with cheese, grilled onions.  Fries.
Burger was way overcooked. Meat was crispy on one side. Flavor would have been good otherwise. I understand I can't have a medium cooked burger like I prefer, but this was overkill. Fries hot and crispy, could of used some salt. Staff was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Greasy burgers with out much hamburger taste.  Fries were very lacking in flavor.  Perhaps this is more of an ice cream spot... but the burgers are a miss for me.  

Overall I wasn't impressed and will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow. 

I'm definitely a fan of this place. I haven't been inside yet, but I definitely look forward to it on my next trip! But my total experience was outstanding!!! 

I arrived early Sunday afternoon a little after 11:00am and the place was pretty busy. I got up to the drive thru menu board and was easily overwhelmed. Which in this case was a good thing. They have burgers, sandwiches, salads and of course custard!!! 

I had already checked out the menu online and since it was so early I just went with one of the Snack Paks- you get a menu item (chicken tenders, butter burger, etc, fries and a drink) for a little over $4. In my opinion that's a pretty good deal for the \"not so hungry\" customer. 

So one of the major reasons I'm such a fan of this place is that after you order and pull up to the drive thru window you pay and they give you a number, you simply park your car in the spot that matches your number and they bring out the HOT, freshly prepared food to your car. AWESOME!!!! 

Here's the run down, I went with the chicken tenders and fries with a root beer to drink:

Chicken Tenders- Yum! They were totally not what I expected. But in a good way. The tenders did not have too much breading and were not too crunchy...very good seasoning and the best part was the tenders were all white meat. Score! Totally a win in my book! 

Fries- OMGGG....FINALLY....HOT crinkle cut french fries. Crispy, hot, and just freaking delicious! I totally wish I had ordered more!

Drink- Root Beer- Delish! Seriously, get it! 

Unfortunately, this visit I didn't get any custard, but it's cool because it gives me an excellent reason to come back!  Soon! 

I'd say that they got it right, excellent food and customer service and I can't wait to come back!

 Good job Culver's!"}
{"text":"The burgers just weren't good, especially not for the price. The fries were below average, only the cheese curds tasted anything but bland. If you go, just get the cheese curds and get the rest of your meal somewhere else."}
{"text":"Fast food place, fast review time!

Shaved prime rib sandwich super tasty, cheese curds bite sized mozzarella sticks could use some kind of sauce, crinkle cut fries ordinary, cookie dough craving custard addicting, guilt at gluttony rising, honey badger don't care."}
{"text":"Dang you Culver's, with your proximity and convenient drive through! With all the nearby Baskin-Robbins and DQs now closed, I find myself at Culver's a bit too often.

I do love frozen custard. I'd like to say that I'm not going to say that I had way better frozen custard back East. But I'm not, because I did.

Nonetheless, theirs is pretty decent. They have some tasty flavors of the day. The toppings are ridiculously sweet, however. But obviously it's not enough to keep me away."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  They have a fundraiser opportunity and can't handle the crowd.  My kids have been waiting 25 minutes for their food."}
{"text":"This is some of the best ice cream ice ever had! It's like ice cream on steroids!!! My son and I got the concrete mixers. At buy one, get one free, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Better than McDonald's and Burger King, but not as good at Five Guys or In-and-Out.  I normally just get the regular culver burger, and it's ok.  Ingredients seem fresh, but it just doesn't taste as good as the other competitors.  The fries are tasty, though."}
{"text":"I have family members who love this place!  We met up today and I can see why.  I don't eat fast food as a rule but ended up having a grilled cheese, side salad, and strawberry shake. My family had fried chicken and burgers, along with frozen custatds.

This place is definitely a few steps above Mickey D's, etc.  The service is good, as are the prices.

I do appreciate the pricing and opportunity to order a children's meal.  For my fast-food loving friends, it's a thumbs up."}
{"text":"I have been coming here about 2-3 times a month since they opened a few years ago. Their place is clean and their staff is great, many have been around since the beginning. My kids love the Scoopie Meals. They prefer to have a scoop of custard and a topping instead of a cheap toy. My husband and I usually get the Snack Pack, its a single patty but comes with a small drink and fry. The Snack Pack meals run less than $4. We can get out of there under $20 for 4 meals. There service and quality are always consistant, you can't ask for more."}
{"text":"I love Culver's from Illinois, but tonight when we went into their location there were 6 or so high school aged workers awkwardly yelling at each other rather loudly. They were obnoxiously making fun of one guy for \"flooding the custard machine\".  Someone was shouting to the front about an order. Meanwhile, we stand there waiting and watching an employee slide and hit the custard machine because the floor was wet. 

I nearly turned around and left; however, I haven't had their custard for about two years, and needed my fix. 

I hope a manager or owner can get their employees in shape and presentable for customers soon."}
{"text":"The custard is SO yummy!! I got the pecan sundae and it was delicious. I'm obsessed with cheese curds and theirs are OK, but not exceptional. Way too much breading. The service is always great at Culvers and the place is clean!"}
{"text":"First time we tried this place the wait was super long but the food was great! Tried this place again for the second time tonight and my fiancé and I are very disappointed! He ordered the double bacon deluxe with no onion and no pickles. I ordered the cheddar butterburger with bacon and ONLY pickles...... my fiancé got back a burger with 2 burnt patties with EVERYTHING on it except bacon... and I got a burger with a burnt patty with EVERYTHING on it except bacon... very very disappointing! On top of that AND the long ass wait, the lady at the register messed up when taking our money and had to redo it. My fiancé doesn't want to come back here again. It makes me so sad because the first time it was so good! Oh well..."}
{"text":"The Cod and Walleye they serve is really outstanding, better than you can get at a lot of high end places!  I especially like their cocktail sauce!  Burgers could definitely be seasoned up but there is salt and pepper shakers on every table!  The Management and employees at this location are really super!  Probably the best Culvers I've been to, in large part because of the positive attitude, prompt and friendly service as well as way above average food and frozen custard creations! An overall winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Food and service here is always really good. Way better than most fast food joints. Love their burgers and fries and custards!"}
{"text":"Good service.  Folks behind the counter very courteous and helpful.  Order delivered to table is a nice service.  The fish sandwich basket was great."}
{"text":"Creamy custard with your choice of toppings, mm mm! I like the snack pack burger, the fries are perfectly crisp. They don't have caff free diet pepsi now, but i can get the diet root beer instead. Flavor of the day custard is also a bonus. Average fast food service and cleanliness-depends on the day."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had wonderful time today at Culver's. Employees are so nice and helpful. They messed up our order (gave my daughter French fries -instead of applesauce) she is allergic to potatoes, they were so apologetic, helpful. What a wonderful group of employees!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy they finally got a Culver's here in Buckeye.  Service was slow but they were all trainees. I'm sure they'll pick up the pace as time goes on and they were very courteous. Like always, my burger was tasty and hot. It was my first time trying the cheese curds. They were great!"}
{"text":"I love Culver's butter burgers. This location has awesome food. Every time I've been here (which is about 5 times) the food is fresh. It doesn't have that old taste to the fries. I would have given them a full 5 stars but I only gave 3 and here is why. Customer service is just as important as having great food. This location is lacking very badly in this department. Every time I've been here the staff gives me attitude. They cut me off when I'm trying to order. When I pay there is no smiles or hellos. They pretty much throw my drinks at me and tell me to pull up. The most recent visit I had may be my last as the women at the window was very rude because I had asked for extra candy in my ice cream while I was ordering. She didn't put it in the ice cream when I got to the window so I asked her to please add it. She had a very annoyed look on her face then grabbed it and yelled at a women behind her to add more and shoved it at her. She was mumbling things under her breath the whole time. She then left and had the young women finish giving me my drinks. Hopefully the staff can do a better job at having a good attitude while working with the public."}
{"text":"Ok this has to be the smallest skimpiest single scoop flavor of the day I have ever received at any culvers location I will never go back to this one on Paramenter near the Bruce Company!! not sure why they are  being so conservative on their ice cream scooping this is not worth the money at all....boo!"}
{"text":"Had cod dinner fish was overcooked. We usually go to the avondale location which is excellent. This store could take lessons from them."}
{"text":"The food is good. The custard is amazing. Clean and classy little Burger joint."}
{"text":"Very good cheeseburger. Well cooked, but still moist. The cheese never really completely melted, so I'm thinking that they may want to put the cheese on a bit earlier.

The crinkle fries were fine. Not as good as Raising Cain's but still good fries.

Cheese curds...not much cheese flavor there.

The frozen custard is the star here. Creamy and smooth. 

Service is courteous and efficient!

Overall, a nice quick dinner."}
{"text":"I have had some good experiences here, but mostly so-so. My last Mushroom-Swiss burger was mediocre at best. One slice of mushrooms and 2 crumbs. Took the burger to the front, and the lady looked like I was wrong for complaining. She said: I do not work at the kitchen. I asked to speak to somebody else, and then she informed me she was the person in charge. She asked if a side of mushrooms would help, not even acknowledging the obvious problem. Not what I expected from Culvers."}
{"text":"This is my go to Culver's...it's the only fast food restaurant I go to and I always have a solid and consistent experience. 
Today I went to the drive thru to grab a early lunch before heading to work, I pulled up to the white line and relaxed while I waited for my food. 
About 12 minutes later the manager came out to let me know my food was accidentally given to another car and that is why I was waiting so long-- they had put another meal in for me and gave me a coupon for a free dinner basket and he told me my food would be right out, I said no problem but that I did unfortunately have to be to work in 5 minutes. 
He came out about 5 minutes later with my food and a pint of custard to smooth things over with my boss.
I felt the need to write this review because I feel like they are one of the few fast food places that go the extra mile to make it right when they make a mistake. 
I really admire this and feel appreciated as a custom! Good job Culver's!"}
{"text":"There's something just not right. For those Midwesterners very familiar with Culver's, well, I would rate this sub-par. It's still Culver's nonetheless and their fries are pretty much what I'm used to from back home, but I've been disappointed in the Butter Burger's the 2x I had been here. The taste just seems wrong, the patties over-cooked (maybe left under the heat lamp too long) and they got my order wrong both times. Eeek."}
{"text":"It's a culvers in a college town. Service is fine. I've had nicer, more enthusiastic service elsewhere. I ordered a salad with chicken. The breast was hot a juicy, the salad was 90% iceberg. I hate all the toppings and chicken and left most the lettuce behind. It was good for a quick meal after 9pm."}
{"text":"Food is good, staff is nice. Definitely overpriced though. I think Freddy's is the same concept, but they are much better tasing."}
{"text":"The sundaes are good but everything is overpriced. The last couple of times we stopped by,  our burgers were super greasy. We get that it's a butter burger,  but maybe next time, less butter grease and more burgers, if there is a next time.  And the wait for your food to be delivered at the drive thru is ridiculous. I guess that's what happens went there are tons of fast food choices around the Surprise area, the standards go down."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, my latest visit was my worst experience. 

Mid-october 2014, Tuesday 6pm. The place was very busy. I ordered two double patty burgers with deluxe toppings to go. 

When I got home what I saw really disappointed me. The patties were like always, there was one tomato slice a few shreds of lettuce and a few small rings of red onion. 

What a total rip-off!  

Once again I find myself heading to Five Guys or Fudds for a decent burger. At least at Fudds if the toppings are messed-up I know who's to blame."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to this very clean restaurant - and now I am wondering how I never heard of it.  Here is my compact rating for each item I consumed:
Regular butter burger with everything on it - 4 out of 5 stars - not quite as good as Steak n' Shake or In-N-Out, but definitely very good, just a little \"dry\" for my liking.  Fries - 5 out of 5 stars.  Onion Rings - 5 out of 5.  Cole Slaw - 5 out of 5.  Rocky Road Sundae - 5+ stars out of 5.  On top of all that, the restaurant and bathrooms were very clean.  Service was outstanding.  I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the new Prime Rib dip sandwich. Not much good to say about it. The size of the sandwich was very small and it was very salty. I had the cheese curds for the side which wasn't bad."}
{"text":"They don't listen at all. Don't waist your time trying to customize an order. Asked for 2 things both not listened to. Second time it's happened at this location. I get mistakes happen but not giving a shit is terrible."}
{"text":"I like Culvers when it comes to fast food. They have a good selection even on the healthy side. Custard is fantastic of course, and I'm addicted to cheese curds."}
{"text":"October 19th, first visit. I ordered the single patty butter burger and an order of cole slaw. I added ketchup to the burger as my first 3 bites were a bit bland. The coleslaw was poor.

Beware of the upselling order takers. They may increase your order to larger sizes, add cheese, or make yours a double patty without you asking for it, so always review your order with the person at the register

The burger patty appears to be cooked under a grill weight so the outer edges are crispy and burnt, but tender towards the middle. It is thin, mine was juicy and just a little salty. I think I spied mayo, butter, lettuce, relish, mustard, pickle, below the patty. I felt it really needed something more, but was basically just fine. 

I never order cheese on a burger because IMO it overpowers the flavor of the entire sandwich.

 If nutrition was not an issue, only taste... I would rate fast food burgers:
#1: BK Whopper 
#2: In & Out hamburger, Culver's Butter Burger
#3: Wendy's single
#4: Weinerschnitzel burger or dogs
#5: Red Robin Natural Burger (not really fast food)

(I will not eat at McDonald's, I do not eat sim-food)

And for fries:
#1 Weinerschnitzel
#2 Red Robin
#3 Burger King, Wendy's
#4 Chick-fil-A (always stone cold and mushy)
#5 In & Out (about the worst fries I have ever had)

Coleslaw:
#1 KFC


  The dining area was spotless clean. Service was fast and friendly. Like any other fast food eatery, you walk in and order/pay at the counter, get your empty cups and a plastic order number sign to place on your table. You fill your cups at the drink dispenser enroute to a table of your choosing. Seating indoors or outdoors. They deliver your food to your table after locating your number. Ketchup available from 3 pumps near the drink dispenser.

 Easy to miss, since their sign is low and in the tree line, it resides just east of 19th Ave on the south side of W. Deer Valley Rd, just west of the airport.

$4.80 for a burger, small drink, cole slaw, and sales tax.

Based on this trip I will return but will get carry-out and add my own fixings at home (ketchup and mustard). I think this burger patty would survive re-heating in the nukebox just fine."}
{"text":"This new location opened in late 2016, right out in front of Mountain Vista Hospital near the corner of Southern Ave at Crismon Rd. They got it right from the start.

I was surprised by how fast even complicated orders can get delivered despite the place being elbow to elbow customers and an entirely new and very young staff.

I especially like their dinners and sides, which is mostly what I go to Culver's for. Having grown up in Wisconsin I know a thing or two about butter burgers. Their burgers are nothing to write home about, but their fries are very good and all the other stuff on their menu, including soups and chili and their dinners are an excellent value. I like the North Atlantic Cod with sides of cole slaw and green beans, it's better than the food in the hospital cafeteria!

Don't let the lines inside scare you away, it moves much faster than it would at most other fast food places.

Easy access off north or south bound Crismon Rd. Their parking lot is a little cramped. The drive through moves slowly, I suggest always getting carry-out food inside at the counter.

Oddly enough, they close early at 10:30pm. Research the menu online before going."}
{"text":"Supposedly this is some big burger joint in the Midwest. I got the Buffalo tenders and cheese curds. The cheese curds were so freaking addicting!  They were like mini mozzarella sticks. The tenders were super meaty and crispy. I was full after eating two and the order came with four. The cashier was very friendly. They have an expansive menu of burgers, sandwiches, fish, and more. Wish there was one in cali!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great. Staff was very helpful and attentive. It's like the Wisconsin version of chick fil a....except with beef. Cheese curds, burgers and Ice cream (egg custard as they call it in Wisconsin) were great!!! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Culver's on our roadtrip on the way to PHX.  We had butter burgers, fries, cheese curds, and topped off with some custard for dessert.  The burgers were fresh and tasty.  I had a double that came with lettuce, tomato and onion - I enjoyed it.  Their fries are good crinkle fries and the cheese curds were little balls of fried cheesy deliciousness.  The custard desserts were good too and they come in variations with mix-ins kind of like a DQ blizzard.  Overall it was a good meal, with good service in a clean restaurant.  We may have to stop on the way back !"}
{"text":"Some lady by the name of Carrie seriously has the most horrendous customer service I have EVER experienced. So rude and blatantly disrespectful. I come here often but last time was the LAST time all thanks to Carrie."}
{"text":"Their burgers were too greasy for my tastes. Their onion rings were perfect, and their cherry cheesecake concrete mixer could very well be one of my favorite fast food desserts out there."}
{"text":"Thank God people started opening Culver's franchises in AZ; I've missed them sorely since I left the Midwest.

The food won't make you any thinner but wow it is delicious for fast food.  Favorite order is the Double Deluxe Butterburger Basket.

Every location I've been to has very friendly staff and very clean eating and condiment areas."}
{"text":"Great burgers, nice kids working there... love the fries, but I'm pretty sure my tushy doesn't ...."}
{"text":"An excellent tasting burger that is fresh and not frozen. Their butter burger is what it says buttered up which makes it taste better with red onions, lettuce, tomato, and pickles.  The beef is slightly seared so it has almost wonderful charred crispness as well.  The rest of the menu is completely Midwestern from cheese fries, fried cheese curds, and huge selection of shakes, frozen yogurt, and ice cream."}
{"text":"Listen folks, this is a fast food joint and I typically don't review them.  But, seems how this corner is where restaurants go to hell and die I figured it would be worth putting on Yelp for those who live near by and are desperately looking for something decent to eat.  ANYTHING decent to eat.

This Culvers, like every other one, makes burgers, chicken strips, chicken sandwiches, regular sandwiches, fries, cheese curds, custards, sundaes and quite a bit of other items in that range.  Due to the lack of basic culinary mediocrity in this area there is currently a line in the drive thru and inside that would make you think the food is much better than it actually is. 

Now don't misunderstand me.  I would eat here over Sonic, Jack, McDonalds, Caminero, Top Shelf, Rays Pizza and pretty much anything on any corner near this place BUT at the same time it's not worth waiting in line for 20 minutes.  Just shows how much lacking this area is for options.

If you go, get a butter burger, fries, and a custard.  Pretty much the safest bet.  I would rank it up there maybe higher than Smashburger but under Habit Grill and 5 Guys. 

Happy food hunting.  Hang in there folks...help has to be on the way!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. They play oldies inside and I think that's cute. I dunno though- my meal was all fried and grease. Chicken strips and those cheese balls. Maybe if id ordered something else :-/ no urge to try it out again."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, greeted with a smile, and the food was great. Thank you we'll be in again"}
{"text":"I got the frozen custard here, which is very tasty BUT I'm only giving them three stars because custard should have thicker consistency.

I got the vanilla custard with butterfinger pieces and hot fudge - YUM :) The cool thing about the hot fudge was that it didn't melt the custard too much and had a really sweet flavor, which I appreciated.

I also got to try the Andes flavored custard - which actually tasted like the candy and was green in color, most likely from the mint filling - it was definitely tasty.

If you're in the mood for ice cream, this is definitely a good spot to head to!"}
{"text":"Culver's is a delight. They are always on target with butter fried burgers, which is something you just don't find at any other current burger joints. It's why the meals take longer to come out once your order is placed, even in drive thru.

I order what I usually get when I go to a Culver's, and that is the Mushroom and Swiss burger. Side of fries and a Mountain Dew, and I'm golden. 

Normally I'd get the Wisconsin cheese curds, but today I was in a rush to get to work and the cheese curds can drain you of all energy with their deliciousness, even with the caffeine/sugar combo from the Mountain Dew. 

Looks like I'll be returning to this joint a little more than I should, as I recently discovered that this Culver's is merely a few miles from my workplace out in Buckeye."}
{"text":"I eat here often and the service is pretty good. The Hamburgers have been consistent but some of the other dishes are spotty. I usta really like the cod, but it's hit or miss. Some of the specialty burgers are a little dry, but if you ask for mayo , you get it quick. The deserts are usually good. I just wish you weren't stuck with a special of the day or the usual suspects IMO the mixers are the best part of going there."}
{"text":"I was told this place has great hamburgers and I completely agree.  They served a nice thick hamburger so fresh I can't believe it wasn't home made. Plus it was better than anything I've made at home. I'm sure it had a bunch of calories."}
{"text":"Stopped for food on our way home from a weekend in MN. Service was good, food was the norm for Culver's fare. If you stop here (or any Culver's for that matter) do yourself a favor and get the cheese curds. It's a Culver's must!"}
{"text":"Its a Culver's. Good food, fast, reasonably priced for the most part. Friendly staff. Though, you must specify that plain means NO CHEESE OR ANYTHING ELSE, NOTHING."}
{"text":"Excellent quality fast food, clean new establishment, excellent customer service and the best root beer in town!"}
{"text":"Always love the concrete mixers and the burger and fries. Great food just a little pricier than expect but will be back!!"}
{"text":"Our experience was overall middle of the road. Not great like some reviews nor terrible. Really liked the customer service even though at times it seemed eerily robotic. :)  My Butter Burger was smaller than my bun which irks me, yet it tasted fine. The cheese curds were tasty, but would have been 10x better  had they have been served hot.  BF thought the salad was fine--nothing to write home about.  I liked the root beer because it was not very sweet. The custard was pretty tasty too. If I am in the area, then I would return ( no special trip)"}
{"text":"Do you open at 10 or 1030? Your doors say 10,, but your online profile says 1030.... Please correct the discrepancy since a customer was standing outside your restaurant at 10 waiting to be served...."}
{"text":"Worst fish sandwich ever!  Guy came up and asked how everything was so I told him the fish was mushy and zero flavor.  He said \"oh well everyone likes different stuff\". WTH.  I did like the onion rings a lot.  To top it off a small crawling bug went across the table."}
{"text":"My sister's in-laws are from Wisconsin so whenever we are in Phoenix we have to stop at Culver's and take a picture of the nephew to send to the midwest.  Surprisingly, for a fast-food burger joint, the food is pretty good.  I've had the grilled chicken sandwich, cheese curds, sweet potato fries, onion rings, chicken strips and frozen custard (not all at once, mind you ;) ).  The cheese curds are pretty greasy so difficult to eat too many.  The chicken sandwich was cooked well, moist and on a fresh bun.  The fries and onion rings are quality as well.  But the custard... oh my... super tasty.  Rich, but creamy and worth every bite and calorie.  

This location is clean and the service is quick.  Don't forget to get the custard!"}
{"text":"Staying next door at the Clarion. Not my first choice for food but it's different enough and close. Went in and unfortunately they were playing Christian music. Normally I would leave. I don't need their musical indoctrination.

  The other choice was kfc.

I got in the car and went thru the drive in. instead of giving the food out as it came we had to move forward wrapping around the building. Food is ok. I ordered onion rings instead of fries and got a decent amount. Normally would give 3-4 stars but I refuse extra stars for their lack of respect for people that are not Christian."}
{"text":"Always friendly service. Chicken tenders are delicious and good is filling. Love their custard, it's very creamy."}
{"text":"If I have to eat fast food , this is the one place I don't mind coming to. How ever this location gets crazy busy. The service can be spotty, and some of the menu items aren't as good as they are at other locations. I just order carefully. The burgers are a safe bet."}
{"text":"I like Culver's They are a consistent chain. My negative review is because of the service. I waited App. 15 minutes for a concrete mixer. There were hardly any customers in the store. Finally I got it, after paying a dollar extra for pecans. After I was a good mile from the store I realised they didn't put them in the mixer. When she handed me the mixer , I asked if this was a large....Went to the location off 28 Ave. Yes it was the wrong size. Yikes."}
{"text":"Very Rarly messes up orders and is extremly delicious would recommend to anybody i know."}
{"text":"Service was great, prices were okay, and food was freshly made and hot! Always can count on Culver's!"}
{"text":"First time experience at Culver's and was pleasantly surprised. Service at the counter was very friendly and helpful. The establishment was clean (location is new). Burgers were tasty and loved the fries. The malt (hard to find in other restaurants) was the perfect treat to top off the meal. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have had their food, it is OK, not the greatest for the price you pay.

The ice cream is great! It's very creamy...I love the turtle, but the only thing I don't like about it is that they change the flavors every day and you never know what the flavor will be, that is annoying to me!

When I like something, I stick to the same thing every time. This means that I will ONLY go there once a month for the ice cream that \"I\" like!! The other problem with that is that I always forget when that will be, so that leaves me only going there about 2-3 times per YEAR!!! Which sucks because I DO LOVE that flavor!!"}
{"text":"Ahhh! My favorite ice cream spot, only it's not ice cream its so much better. It's frozen custard which is made with egg yolks so it's creamier and thicker. They have a different flavor each day and the burgers are so scrumptious! The employees are always very friendly and if you have a doggie, they give you a doggie treat when you go through the drive through window. I often get cheese curds and fries and dip my fries in the chocolate custard. Delightful!"}
{"text":"So tasty!!..its been over 7 years since I have had culvers...used to live in Wisconsin ....highly recommended"}
{"text":"Never been here before. You walk up and order. It was fast! The burgers were unexpectedly great and the 'Turtle Sundae' was off the charts. Kids that work there are polite and smile. Makes me feel warm and fuzzy!"}
{"text":"I love culvers but I am disgusted at the quality of the food served at this location.  They don't cook their burgers long enough. Fry the cheese curds long enough. Serve wet buns.  I've been many of Culver's locations through out Phoenix and I am never disappointed but this Tempe location is just the worst.  I will now go out of my way to go to the location downtown on Camelback."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru and they made me pull to the side. I guess the food was cooking and ended up getting a raw chicken sandwich. Are you kidding me. Don't even waste your time."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Culver's that is not worthy of (at least) a 4-star, but this location is not nearly as good as the Chandler location. The food is still tasty but the service mediocre. 

At the other location (and at locations in the Midwest where Culver's originated), they are thorough with asking what you do/don't want on your burgers and go around asking if they can get you anything, taking your trays, etc. they often will grab a highchair for me as well if they see my hands full. While our kids meal and burgers were great, we were missing toppings and not offered any assistance, which is slightly disappointing. 

Still a tasty meal and friendly service, just don't expect them to go above and beyond. Butter burger deluxe, crinkle fries, custard, cheese curds, buffalo chicken strips(the regular have a breading that is not as good) , salads and grilled cheese for kiddos are great at all locations and food always comes out fresh!"}
{"text":"Great burgers that always make us feel a bit sick afterwards and fries that are under done.  The good things are the ice-cream or custard as they say and their fish is delicious."}
{"text":"I moved to the area a little over a month ago and I have been to Culver's twice now.  Both times the meal has been good and filling.  The first time through the drive thru I was confused when they gave me a number and asked me to pull forward.  After doing it a couple times I wonder why more places don't do the same.  The first time I had The Culver's Bacon Deluxe, onion rings and strawberry shake.  The onion rings are probably the best I have had.  The second time I switched out the onion rings for chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"Welcome to Delicious!
While you have to have a frozen custard they have plenty of other choices as well to keep everyone happy.  Love that they still have a small town feel even being a chain.
Custard type deserts for everyone - shakes, scoops, toppings galore, they've got it.
Fries, tots, burgers, sandwiches, grilled cheeses, salads, fish, etc... I can go on.
They participate in lots of local events and charities and I've got to hand it to them.  When my kids come home with a blue token for a free frozen custard, I'm not sure who is more excited!"}
{"text":"Here's what I like about Culvers:
Thanks a Farmer Campaign- LOVE LOVE this.
THEY LOVE WISCONSIN! Beef, Cheese, Milk, Farms, ...
It's clean inside, staff is polite, and generally seem happy to be there.
Who wants food served from someone who hates their job?
While I wouldn't eat here everyday day, if we're going to stop for fast food it's an easy decision.  Frozen custard all the way!"}
{"text":"Service is A+
From when we order our food till when we leave, you can tell that service and smile has been instilled from the beginning.
As little children will do, mine spilled her lemonade all over the table. The Culver's staff was right there wiping everything up without an attitude or eye roll.  I appreciate that from the teenager helping us.  
Thank you!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! I think I just had the best burger I ever tasted!!! My first time here and it was pure heaven!!
I love In-nOut Burger too, but Culver's puts their burgers in a different arena!
The staff and service at this location is awesome!"}
{"text":"I am In burger love. They are fantastic. Have the necessary crusty goodness. Bread is toasted. Toppings fresh. I am partial to the mushroom Swiss and the bacon adding the mushrooms. Omg those onion rings. Yummy. I had the fish it was flaky and crunchy and had a cheese slaw . It was on a sub roll. Most time you order it's brought out to the red tag on your door. Hot fresh delicious. I like them. Better than 5 guys because cost and quality Culvers wins. Don't forget taste . Yummmmmmmyyy mmm mmmm"}
{"text":"Butter...

Beef...

Cheese...

LOVE. 

I love a good thin beef patty, crispy and juicy..cheese --yummiest cheese melting while I'm eating. Yumm

Root Beer.. Yum..I love the ice cream here..not s huge fan of the fries..this is a good place to get fat! And I have no problem with that."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger and had a mom and pop joint in mind that is right around the corner from this Culvers.  Unfortunately, for them, they only take cash and I spent all but 3 bucks from my wallet from last weekend.  Too bad I dont bartend, wait, or strip or I would have cash on me more often.

I am sure glad I did come here.  I was treated with respect, my card was happily accepted, and the food was much better than expected. 

I ordered the bacon doube w/ cheese curds (yeah, tell me about.  Sure couldnt eat this stuff everday).  The cheese curds were good and the burger was awesome.  Lots of flavor, fresh, and juicy.  It may have been a few bucks more than that mom and pop joint but it sure was worth it!"}
{"text":"I find myself eating here from time to time as they are close to where I work.  I usually go through the drive thru and head back to the office to eat.  More times than not, I find myself ordering their cashew chicken salad and if I'm feeling rebellious I'll get some cheese curds too.
EVERY time I order the salad, I find myself waiting way longer than I would expect. How long does it take to heat up some chicken that was probably already pre-cooked and throw it on top of some greens? Apparently much longer than it takes to cook a burger. Other people in line behind me were receiving their meals.
One instance I watched the clock and it took 9 minutes from when I paid for my order to when I received the order. THEN I got back to the office to find half of the lettuce was slimy and old. I couldn't even eat it.  I went on their website to provide feedback about my experience and never heard any kind of response.
It's disappointing for the North side of town. There aren't many options for \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"Always love their cheese curds but today I decided to go with a cod fillet, on the side I got the flavor of the day which was really Reece's, Yum! It was so delicious with chunks of Reece's pieces. Cod sandwich was a bit greasy but delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"Always great to find a burger joint which has high standards when it comes to their ingredients, particularly the beef.  Juicy, thicker than a typical fast food burger patty,  and of course perfectly paired with the buttery bun.  The original burger is a decent size and comes in at under 400 calories. Simple food done in such a great way really makes the visit worthwhile. This location is very clean, very welcoming, and has great customer service. I've heard a lot about their frozen custard,  so looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't done a review for this Culvers yet! This locAtion is the best of the 4 we have been to in the valley(Mesa, Avondale, Camelback, and this). Arguably better than the million in the Midwest where I am from as well. I would give the others four because all Culver's serve fresh and fabulous food. Keep in mind that this chain cooks everything to order so do not expect McDonald's timing...but the quality is much higher. 

 The service at this location tends to go above and beyond. Someone walking around, seeing what they can get for you, such as refills, high chairs, plastic ware, etc. They have disposable bibs and a wonderful outdoor seating area with fans. 

Food-wise, butter burger deluxe is a must for a newbie, and the buffalo chicken strips are amazing. Family/friends also like the shrimp basket, pot roast sandwich and tenderloin. The cheese curds are the best EVER and order ranch with them. They give you a lot of them, but you may not want to share. :-) the crinkle cut fries are always cooked perfectly. Lastly, order a concrete or a sundae \"for later.\" You bring up your receipt after your meal and they create and bring out your treats. I like small snickers and Reese's concrete or a strawberry sundae...with actual real fruit, not pie filling crapola."}
{"text":"Boyfriend talked about the cheese curds here, so I stopped here on my way back to Columbia from the Charlotte airport to see what the hype was about. The good thing is that this Culver's is located right off the interstate. The curds were pretty average, and they offered marinara or ranch as a condiment. I went with the marinara. The breading is crispy, but my order was just lukewarm. For the cost of a regular order of curds ($4.xx total), there were only about eight little balls of cheese, so I think I prefer the fried cheese from another major chain. They also gave me the wrong change, so I had to wait for them to correct that error. This probably still won't deter me from trying their burgers and custard next time though, because I'm pretty curious."}
{"text":"Tried this location after often going to the Peoria near Cactus location. Was very happy with the meal and my daughter wanted a dinner so she ordered the chopped steak and was happy with her meal. This will be a regular family spot as we were all so full afterward."}
{"text":"It's like a Dairy Queen copy cat except it doesn't taste anywhere near as good. I've never been to this location but I've been to many others."}
{"text":"Prices were good and service was quick. The burger patties were burned badly to the point of being crunchy along the edge, and ruined an otherwise well put together and tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"This Culver's has the worse service of any fast food place that I have ever visited. Went last Saturday and sat behind one car in the drive thru. Sat for five minutes with the car in front of me being ignored. My passenger actually called Culver's to try to get helped of course hung up. Finally took order and when I paid rather than apologize for the wait clerk is laughing about it. They make you pull up and than when it backs up the honking begins. Food would have to perfect to make up for the sorry service and it is not even close. If you want to be laughed at for expecting even minimal service this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Six months later and I'm knocking off a star. The accuracy of this location run at probably less than 20?. I'm also not understanding why gluten free buns remain packaged and the burger deconstructed. This isn't a Culvers thing because Sauk, Baraboo, Madison and every other location serves the burger correctly.

Drive thru is useless. You can plan on your order being something different than what was ordered. Go in the store and check it before leaving.

Even frozen custard orders are often incorrect. I am amazed at the lack of quality control behind the counter.

The staff is very friendly, the kids serving are nice and polite. They just need training. 

If it weren't for the fact Cross Plains is somewhat remote with very limited options, I would stop coming here altogether.

As I said I my previous review, I love Culvers... This location is an anomaly,and it isn't getting any better. Sorry, folks."}
{"text":"Great Location. Great Food. Fast service. Cant complain about a thing. Im glad there is a Culver's near my home in Paradise Valley. Will return for future visits."}
{"text":"diarhea.  Three times from this place.  Once from a burger, once from chicken fingers and once from frozen custard.  Love the chain.  Just not this location.  Too bad too because it is the closest to my house.  Finally learned my lesson.  NOT GOING BACK to this location"}
{"text":"Culver's - oh how I love thee!! Those butterburgers, creamy frozen custard and fried cheese curds make my arteries scream and my behind expand but my tastebuds rejoice the entire time! Wish we had them in the city, on the other hand, it probably would lose its appeal if so easily accessible!"}
{"text":"The food was good, I had the beef pot roast sandwich and fries, I dipped my sandwich in bbq sauce and it was yumm. The crinkle cut fries were good too. I liked everything I had at this location. I used the drive thru to order, they took my order then handed me a number and sent me ahead to park. This was odd but they didn't take too long and the food was good so all was well."}
{"text":"I love Culvers BUT this location is HORRIBLE! Not once have I gone and my order was correct or the fries weren't greasy or burned. It's sad, I drive out of my way to go to another location all because they hire people who don't care to do their job right."}
{"text":"After waiting about a good 10 minutes at the drive through speaker , starting to wonder if they had shut down early (it was 10:15pm) a girl speaks and says \"what can I get for you\" in the rudest tone like I was burdening her for trying to order food. My friend made a smart remark \"jeez about time.\" I turned to him and said, stop being rude she's going to spit in our food. Then an evil laugh comes over the speaker and then says \"oh bet I would, now what can I get for you\" Me and my friend both looked at each other in shock of what we heard and decided to take our business elsewhere. I've worked in customer service for over 5 years and am so disgusted and shocked at the way I was treated here. Will never be back again. So horrible I cringe to give this place even 1 star."}
{"text":"No the place to go for a decent burger.  It was worse than \"Freddy's Steakburger\" in that it was cold, plastic and lacked a upscale burger feel.  For the price, I would go to Red Robin first."}
{"text":"I thought the burger was good. Better than your standard fast food burger. The onion rings were really good. Crunchy and they had a homemade taste to them. Not like burger kings, which are obviously frozen. I will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Went there and tried the food and it was good. Kinda pricey but the food is good."}
{"text":"If Culver's were on every other block, like some of the \"other\" fast food burger places, those \"other\" places wouldn't be in business.
 
Culvers has fresh made-to-order burgers and sandwiches which are very tasty, made with fresh ingredients and very affordable! Plus, the burgers taste delish! They remind me of burgers from my childhood, but I can't put my finger on where. Suffice it to say, they're really, really, good.
 
Their french fries are always hot and yummy, and although I haven't tasted their ice cream, it looks fab!

The personel are always cheerful and friendly, and they bring you your food minutes after ordering...to your table! 

Trust me, skip Mickey D's and Burger Queen and go to Culvers!"}
{"text":"We stopped in due to a burger craving and were impressed with the cleanliness of the place and the crazy amount of people working. The burgers were really good and came out super fast, fries were just ok. The biblical verses on the walls were a bit much for me, but if that's what it takes to run a pleasant fast food restaurant, then so be it :-) I'd definitely go back for frozen  custard - if you're a frozen dessert fan you'll be impressed."}
{"text":"So the guy named rj I think his name was, so he got the Order right but I literally compliment him and he just says \" okay\" and then he never smiled or anything so. Picky but its his job"}
{"text":"Chain did come through with free meal. Tried to go healthy, but not a satisfying meal. The grilled chicken was a huge piece of thick cut breast, but was served dry on sort of a pretzelish bun. Had to ask for mayo from counter. The Green Beans weren't that bad with some red onions, but they seemed to be from a can or frozen, not fresh. Best part of course was the free custard of the day (after filling out receipt survey). This is where Culver's shines - Nestle crunch swirl was a great flavor of the day."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm even giving them one star is because the food is always yummy. 
Me and my husband came in here one night at 9pm, one other person in the restaurant. Ordered 2 concrete mixers and some chicken. We received the chicken within 5 minutes and it was hot and delicious. However, it took over 30 minutes for us to receive our ice cream. We had to remind them that we were still waiting 2 times before they finally brought it out to us. This location is always very slow but 30 minutes for 2 concrete mixers??? That's just ridiculous. And they didn't even apologize or offer us a refund."}
{"text":"I typically do not write bad reviews however my last two visits to Culver's in Waunakee have been less than satisfactory. Last night, we went to Culver's to get carryouts for dinner. We ordered at the drive thru and that's where the first issue occurred. Put our order in for 2 hamburgers and one small order of fries. Got to the window to pay and we were told the bill was $14+. The person made a mistake and entered 5 hamburgers -simple mistake, simple correction. Then the waiting began...we watched as 5-6 cars received their orders and drove away, and we waited & waited. Finally went inside and inquired about our order. Staff had it sitting on the counter and said they thought we were eating inside - even though we ordered at the drive-thru. So they initially handed us the bag with our food after it had been sitting for a minimum of 10-15 minutes. We asked for hot food, and they said they would re-make the meal. After finally getting the food, we went home and this is what we received - I have to say it was the worst hamburger I have ever had at Culver's. It not only looked very unappetizing but was cold, unseasoned and the bun was burned. Very disappointed in this Culver's - am hoping that this was just a bad night..."}
{"text":"My wife and I wondered what Culver's was when visiting next door where the service is soooooo slow. We tried it and fell in love with the place. I got a coupon and went back again. We've been back several times now. Their Snackpak values are all we need and really good. Their own brand of root beer is just amazing! The people are really well trained and very friendly and helpful. When they make an error, and they do so tell them, they fix it quickly with added value. We love the cheddar cheese and the cheese curds come highly recommended although we have yet to try them. Dan McCurdy (and his wife who we haven't met) is the franchise owner and is friendly and works along side the staff. Nate, a manager, is also friendly and very helpful. They'll clear your tray for you and constantly check the dining area to be of help. The staff is so well trained it makes me wonder why other similar restaurants are so slack. Needless to say I'm impressed."}
{"text":"My first experience at Culver's was in Oconomowoc Wisconsin while visiting my Dad. He loves this place and it is always a tasty treat. They have a little bit of everything on their menu and it is an easy score with the whole family.

It is hard to resist a Butter Burger and some Custard to finish off the meal. Normally go crazy and order more than I need to eat. You can always walk it off at the PV Mall right next door. I've tried the Burgers, Chicken, BBQ Beef, and several others on the menu. Food is always good and it reminds me of going back to the Midwest to visit family and old times. Nice!

This location is a little smaller than some of the others. Get there early to beat the crowd during that shopathon time of year and don't forget to order some Custard.

Cheeseheads Rule!"}
{"text":"We typically don't have a problem with this culvers, it's at a good location but we were disappointed this weekend. We ordered a couple of burgers and my husband specifically got a mushroom and Swiss burger, asking for everything on it because it comes with nothing but the mushrooms and cheese. When he got it there was nothing but the regular toppings. On the receipt it said \"everything\" under toppings so we know we were heard. We would have gone back but we went through the drive through due to the packed house and our crying baby. Hoping for better service next time."}
{"text":"Salads at Culvers? Yes, especially when you have a date that your not going to be seeing again and they are advertising a 2-1 Salads deal. Any $7 salad is a BOGO at this location. So, it feels like I paid for a meal, but not hers, but she is still eating because I paid. Anyway, the salads were average at best, mine had some crumbled bacon and blue cheese and fresh cooked chicken chunked on top. Not sure if the chicken was cooked through or did my raspberry vinagrette dressing make the chicken appear undercooked? You can finish the salad in 8 minutes, but somehow this woman took 30 minutes of playing with her salad before she finally finished. I turned in the receipt at the end of the meal and got a free scoop of the flavor of the day, so it turned into a better meal, but date still left a lasting stank long after I drove the 10 back to the homestead."}
{"text":"Best culvers in Madison.  Open late and accurate w. orders.  

I miss when they delivered."}
{"text":"They've got more than they handle and it's evident by the poor food prep and filling orders incorrectly.    I'm not one to gripe about fast food, but they have messed up several of my orders.   Last two orders from the store:    The \"golden brown flaky fish dinner\" was over cooked, to the extent that the coating was dark brown, almost burned.   The next recent experience....  Ordered a double cheeseburger basket with everything on the burger to go.   Got home and the double didn't have anything on it and was over cooked."}
{"text":"I can only speak for Culver's fish sandwich because I never had one of their burgers. So this review is NOT about any other items Culver's sells.

Culver's is like one of my favorite places to go for a fish sandwich because it is made with North Atlantic cod that is hand cut, hand battered and cooked to order. There's no denying it, their Fish sandwich is like a Filet O' fish on 'roids. It isn't a processed fish filet like other \"fast food\" places. Their fish is light, tender and juicy.  The batter tastes great, without being greasy. It was perfectly crispy. I found every bite to be delicate, flaky extremely tasty and and plentiful.

PRICE: reasonable prices. SERVICE: Friendly employees and they bring your order to you so that you don't stand around awkwardly waiting on your food. FOOD:  The portions and value are very good. Absolutely the finest quality and unlike a typical fast food fish sandwich fish and chips, it isn't  oily. it had a nice breading with a tempura quality to it, but thicker. AMBIENCE: The interior itself is very nice, clean and well decorated. CONCLUSION:  If you are looking for good quality fast food, friendly service, great variety at a decent price then this place is for you ...You really can't ask for more."}
{"text":"THree hours after eating at this location, things started going wrong with the body if you know what I mean. All I ordered was your basic cheeseburger and a chocolate custard shake. The burger didn't have its usual crispness, but otherwise seemed OK. Probably a bad batch of milk for the custard. I would skip this location and try another one because I still like Culvers and it wasn't a major food poisoning incident, but something was definetly wrong with the food since it was the only thing I ate all day."}
{"text":"Culver's is everything In n' Out Burger is supposed to be but isn't. 

High quality fast food with the friendliest service you will ever find. 

There's nothing like a Butter Burger and Cheese Curds."}
{"text":"I've gone to Culver's twice on my lunch hour since writing my last review. 

I have to say my second and third experience was not as good as the first. While the food is still easily the best chain fast food out there, the service leaves much to be desired. 

Both times I sat waiting 40 minutes for my food while confused staff members walked around aimlessly with people's orders trying to figure out what belonged with who. 

Unlike the other Culver's locations I have been to, the staff at this location are not very friendly. They act overly friendly as if they have been told it is part of their job. But it comes off as insincere and even a bit patronizing. (Is there anything worse than being patronized by a snot-nosed teenage fast food worker?)

If you want to try out a Culver's, I recommend avoiding this one and going to the one on Peoria or  the one on Deer Valley."}
{"text":"The burgers were alright, but not worth the price to me, and one of the managers was really rude to my mom when we went. Probably wont be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Double Mushroom and Swiss was EVERYTHING!!!!! Service was great, just rude customers jumping in line. But overall experience was good!"}
{"text":"This place was clean and the service was top notch! It is a cross between a Dairy Queen and a Carl's Jr. If you are hungry - get your hamburger with 2 patties - they are kinda slim. The fries were great and they have a ton of frozen custard desserts."}
{"text":"This is a steak and shake want to be. When we first started going there my wife and I both liked it. The last time we went there there's holes in the upholstery in the booths.  I'm not going to go to someplace that's ran down when I'm spending my money. The people are always friendly but they really need to reupholster the booths. That's why the low rating."}
{"text":"Cheese curds and Root Beer Floats! My daughter had some time to kill and so we decided to check out Culver's. I have been to this Culver's before. I enjoy their butter burgers: thin patties with slightly toasted buttered buns. I also enjoy their chicken fingers, nicely breaded and savory.

I love their signature root beer. Their electronic sign flashes their Daily Specials. That night, the Special was $2 Root Beer, any size. I was so excited. We ordered a large.root beer. If you choose to drink it fast and you still have ice cream, you can top it up at their drink and condiment station for free.

My daughter loves fried cheese, so we ordered the cheese curds. I am not usually a fan of cheese curds, squeaky cheese things I tried in the Midwest. However, this was like mini-mozzie sticks. They have two types of cheese curds in the order: cheddar and mozzarella. I tried both. The cheddar is more flavorful. The mozzarella is ooey-gooey pull-apart stringy.

The staff was a little tired that night. We went in at 9:30 pm, half an hour before closing. We were reminded that they closed in 30 minutes by a cashier who seemed devoid of energy, understandably. Props to the girl who brought our order to the table (you get a number when you order). She was very cheerful and pleasant."}
{"text":"Daily Deals! I love checking out their daily deals or eating when I have a coupon in the mail. I love their rootbeer floats or their rootbeer for that matter, next to A&W's. I also enjoy their butterburger. Who doesn't love a toasted bun on the grill? Their crinkle fries are okay. Their custard is okay. I like their chicken fingers, mushroom and swiss burger and their Northern Pike fish is pretty tasty. Anyway, without the coupons, Culver's is on a pricey side.

Tip: Oh, if you know someone who works at the location, they have a friend discount. Just mention who you know."}
{"text":"Fresh food made and brought to the table. Daughter number 2 and I decided to break for lunch at Culver's after shopping. We had a coupon for Buy 1 Value Basket and Get 1 Free. We ordered the Culver's Deluxe Basket and the North Atlantic Cod Value Basket ($8.50 each). Later, we purchased a Deluxe Snack Pack (around $5).

The Butterburger at Culver's comes with a nicely toasted bun. The burger is tasty and the veggies are fresh. We adore their Culver's root beer almost as draft A&W. Not quite, though. The North Atlantic Cod came beer battered, but the sandwich seemed a little small to me. Crinkle cut fries are plentiful in the basket. I got their sweet potato fries. It was nicely fried. The value baskets are generous in their fries. You also get a medium drink. Without a coupon, I believe that the snack pack was better price-performance.

We had our fill, and sadly, did not finish our fries. We will come back again."}
{"text":"My butter burger was very dry and tasteless. My order was wrong but they did nicely remake it.  My hubby said his food was just ok. This is the 2nd time I have eaten at this Culver's and both times the food hasn't been great. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Precooked burger and cold piece of cheese on top...yuk.....stick with in ans out for a fresh burger"}
{"text":"This location used to be good ... just went tonight to get the flavor of the day which they advertised as \"salted double Carmel pecan\", but instead was served \" double marshmallow Oreo\" disgusted with this place on how they deceived us... will not be going back to this location!"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal here, and the staff is startlingly and consistently friendly and courteous. The country music is the only downer."}
{"text":"I love Culver's chicken strips and their cheese curds. I ate at a Culvers up in Wisconsin so I was excited to see one here. Same good food. Service was also good though it took a while to get my food but when it came out it was hot and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best burger place around. I always enjoy the double mushroom Swiss burger. Fries are actually really good as well. Definitely need to get a concrete style shake from them, make sure to get \"concrete.\""}
{"text":"Terrible service. Have been to this location a few times and either the food isn't good, the service isn't, or both. This last time there was a problem with the charge going through, as my card company has a very \"active\" card security watching for fraudulent charges, and instead of being discreet, they were sure to let the entire restaurant know the charge wasn't going through. Culvers in general is pretty good, this location just is not."}
{"text":"We have been there several times already, and everything has been great.
Except for the last time we got our food to go. Our cheese and bacon burger had no bacon, and was so plain that McDonalds sounded better.
I think we'll stick to their ice cream and drinks."}
{"text":"I  dont give out many 5's, but this place gets it. You feel very welcomed when you walk in the door. And they even had a treat for my dog. You could feel this place we filled with love and all the employees where happy to be at work you could just tell. Which in turn spread out into the dining area. 
Food was great, fresh and hot when we got it. It was so good the next day we went back but this time we went thru the drive thru. Just as nice, just as fresh and saw my dog in the car and handed us a treat for her. 
This place will never disapoint you."}
{"text":"They bring you your food. They check on you. The staff is friendly and helpful. Love this place. Love the fish. I want to come back to taste the burgers. Nice and spacious eating area. Reminds me of Zaxbys meets Chick fil a."}
{"text":"Terrible service, expensive of course I was starving and I had never been to a Culvers and will never go back! I got a value meal for $8.00 not a great value really, but anyway got the Swiss and mushroom burger... No sauce on it no offer of sauce...fries were ok but no ketchup in bag nor was it offered. Burger had 2 mushrooms maybe could not taste the Swiss the burger was over salted and dry needed some kind of sauce maybe mayo mustard something! Anyhoodle never again and would not recommend to anyone...maybe an enemy..."}
{"text":"Lived in PHX for 10 years and first time I tried the place. The burgers are very good, they are different flatter and crispier on the outside so different but they taste great (see my pictures). 
I had 2 for 1 coupon and I planned to only eat one but ended up eating both because they were so good.
Cheese curds are interesting as well.
The ice cream, or frozen custard has many options and toppings so you can get pretty much anything to fit your needs.
The fish sandwich is better than Burger King and McDonalds.
Very good place for kids.
There was 1 nice TV in there so if they happen to be showing your channel then your in luck. Definitely better than other fast food dinning areas."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this location.  The food was great..similar to other locations but the restaurant wasn't clean like the other locations that I've visited.  It was 7:45 at night so they were not that busy.  I usually go to Culvers every blue moon because I like the cleanliness of the restaurant as well as the food.  This location was a disappointment.  Culvers is known for their burgers and shakes but also for how clean they are.  I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Culver's milkshakes are second to none but both times I've been to this one they've screwed up my order. First time I waited a long time and they gave me someone else's order, which happened to be more food than I ordered so no harm no foul but the second they gave my order to someone else and I had to wait twice as long. Still love Culver's, just not this one."}
{"text":"With the dollar discount it's still $9.15 for fish basket, over priced, kind of a rip!"}
{"text":"I have had lunch here twice. The burgers are pretty good and the fries are above average for the industry with a nice crispy crust and a hot soft interior."}
{"text":"I don't get it? I don't understand the fascination with Culvers? The food costs twice that of Wend's, Mc D's, Hardys, or Burger King, and with the doubling of the price it has double of the grease! They figured if you \"butter toast\" the buns you can serve stale bread and know one will know. If you order through the drive through you will be given a number and have to wait. Worst yet if you order a sundae you will get it first while you wait 15-20 minutes for you order to cook. Just in time for you to enjoy you sundae as soup. Worst yet it is not ice cream it is \"custard\". A frank'en food knock off of real ice cream. Oh, and the fry's are soggy. I don't get it. Amongst my friend I'm apparently the only one that doesn't like this place?"}
{"text":"I love Culvers but this one needs......\"
2 of 5 stars 
You would think this is a very new Culvers. The issue I have is like always if you are in the customer service industry you need to make sure you behave that way. I was addressed with \"What can we make fresh for you today?\". If you ask then I will share with you what I want. I asked for a burger no onion, with a side of mayo. What I got was a burger with onion and no side of mayo and they forgot one of our fries. Not a huge deal and we got over it but should be more accurate in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is known for their burgers but has really good chicken. For some reason they are always out and need to have you call ahead so they can have it ready for you. I am okay with that and that is what I did. When we pulled up to place our order the woman working drive thru aggressively  told us that they are out of chicken and it would be 20 min. Before she even checked. Just like that wants to shut it down. When we told her that we called ahead and heard her ask one of her coworkers if there is chicken baking we heard them say yea 8 more minutes. She comes back and rudely replies I didn't know that so it's  8 more minutes you wanna come down????. 
Completely totally rude. If you happen to see her she is about 5 ft tall. In her 40s or looks as if....and could stand to lose a good 60 pounds. 
I usually go to the one on cave creek. Their warmer was broken. Yes they have lots of younger folks but at least they are nice and polite. 
You are in the wrong business lady. 
Go back to training."}
{"text":"Always the best place to sneak away to and grab a ice cream. Love the burgers and the fresh fries. Can't. Stay. Away......"}
{"text":"I don't know what Culver's  everyone else went to, but I had the misfortune of going to the same Culver's that Allen went to. Let me count the reasons I won't be back:

1.) Too-crowded parking lot - Jesus H. Tapdancing, I get nightmares about Ted's Hot Dogs just looking at all the people lined up to eat unhealthy processed food. I had to walk a block away to the front door. 

2.) Nowhere to sit once you're inside. All the tables are full. I had to stand and circle the restaurant like a vulture looking for a place to sit. 

3.) Customer base skews elderly. I counted two - correction, three - elderly couples with walkers who needed the door held open for them. Not exaggerating. If you're under 60, you have no business eating at Culver's. But, hey, that's just me. 

4.) The beverage lids are apparently dispensed from this confusing doohickey thing. I'm fumbling with the doohickey trying to get the lid for my cup, and a rude (and elderly: see point #3) Culver's employee practically yells at me, \"No, you do it like this-!\" Thanks. I'll remember that if I'm ever in there again.

5.) The food wasn't worth the wait. Nearly every item on the menu is a different variation of their hamburger. The chicken and fish items are *very* difficult to find, even if you're looking up at the menu.  

Nobody greeted  me or welcomed me with a \"Welcome to Delicious\" when I got there. Someone did open the door for me when I left, but that was only because I was behind an elderly couple with a walker. 

I have been to In-N-Out. Never disappointed. I have been to Five Guys. Never disappointed. However, I was and am VERY DISAPPOINTED with Culver's - is it a \"Midwest thing?\" I don't get it. Am I alone in wondering what the hype's all about? 

VERY OVERRATED."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to get some dessert, ordered a custard with chocolate bits which was served to me melted. Literally could've just poured it out the cup like it had been sitting out for ten minutes already. I was very disappointed, go to Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Early afternoon visit.  Service was prompt and courteous.  Had the chicken almond salad which was really very good.  I almost bought a second one.  Salad with bottled water was about ten bucks.

Restaurant was very clean.  My favorite fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and I'm still impressed. My husband inhaled his double bacon cheeseburger . I had a cod fillet by itself. Which was really a cod fillet! It was very good. Also inhaled. My side salad was very fresh. Customer service was great again!"}
{"text":"Big mistake. We wanted a quick meal and tried Culver's drive thru. There was no one in line yet they made us go park. When the employee brought us our food they just tossed the bag at us and walked away. We had to call them back for ketchup and then a second time for napkins. The sandwiches were nearly tasteless and my mint chocolate milk shake was thin, overly mint flavored and the few pieces of chocolate were sitting on the bottom of the cup. We won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"two words.....BUTTER BURGER!!!, add a custard and your in some serious business!!!"}
{"text":"Today was  opening day for this location (MetroCenter area) and I had to go in and try the ButterBurger. I ordered the double with the full complement of condiments. The burger was really tasty (the butter does make a difference) and fresh. Considering the busy time (early evening) and the dinner crowd, I got my order pretty fast. I'm looking forward to trying the other items next time, especially the frozen custard."}
{"text":"Food is good, fresh and tasty.  The store inside is very nicely decorated, patriotic and displaying local history.  This is a real convenient, easy off and on the I-10 for either direction.  
The food is better than a lot of other quick stops up and down the freeway too.  For local's it's a nice place to hang out as well.  Unfortunately, I live right up the street and really SHOULD be working on eating less. : ( Oh wel, theres always next years resolution."}
{"text":"Went in to culver's and split a pepper burger I got for free winning one of contests and had a $1,00 root beer float. We caught the end of the car show looks like we missed a bunch of cool cars, but glad we saw what we did"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Culvers you should try it for lunch today. 
Great Steak Burgers and malt,  In-N-Out cannot keep up."}
{"text":"Tried to find something to eat at 9 pm. Ended up in Culver's. Tried their butterburger value basket. Overall there was nothing special with their fries or burger. The burger tastes really similar to steak 'n shake's burgers. As for their fries, really plain. Pretty average fast food I would say."}
{"text":"Being from out of town, I want to try as much \"non-native\" food as I can, Culvers was one of them and did not disappoint.

Now that I've been once I need to go again so I can order what I really want this time: vanilla custard with blueberries! ...I was significantly confused on what a butter burger was but it's a burger with a buttered bun from what I hear. Overall, it was good, and I hope to go back before leaving.

I strongly suggest everyone from out of town try this."}
{"text":"I love Culvers but there are like none on the east coast. So when I saw this one I had to stop! I was greeted right away and the staff was very friendly and the food was fresh and delicious! It was very clean also."}
{"text":"Culver's is a good place to eat. They have wide range of items on their menu with a good variety. Burgers, sandwiches, fish, frozen curd, shakes, malts, you name it! It's great to see the crinkle fries. Don't see them too often and they are a welcome sight!  

The service was fast. They give you a plastic number stand that you put on the edge of your table. Then they come by and switch out the number for your food. Easy and simple process.

Their parking lot is a little funny but not to hard to navigate. Just know you can't always take a direct route in. Otherwise there is a ton of parking. Oh, and they have a drive though as well. I haven't tried it so I don't know how fast it is.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Culver's. They have some unique offerings that make them stand out."}
{"text":"The meat on the cheeseburger was overly done and cold. The cheese on top hadn't melted at all. I took it back and reported the issue. When the manager brought the new sandwich, he suggested  \"In the future, make sure you tell them you want some of the cheese melted.\" He totally missed my point about the burger being cold. No, I shouldn't need to tell staff to \"make sure the meat is warm enough.\" Ridiculous. But for the fairly consistent (note I'm not saying great)food quality at their other locations, I'd have given my experience 2 stars."}
{"text":"Bomb bay ! everything here is good."}
{"text":"Never been here before. Great place. Ordered a double cheese burger combo. It was so tasty .I will definately come here when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is the worst overpriced place.  Every time I go through the drive up they get the meal wrong.  Good luck getting the right meal.  They don't seem to care that part of your meal is sitting there getting cold while they remake the part they got wrong!  They also give you the ice cream before you get your meal. Don't they live in Arizona?  I love melted ice cream! Your better  choice is down the road at In and Out Burger!"}
{"text":"So if you want a true gourmet burger, you must go to a bar that has reputable bar food. This is difficult in Phoenix, the cuisine here is disappointing in every way, I know, I'm from the obese state of Wisconsin where people demand great food ( the state pastime). But Culver's, being from Wisconsin, is the obvious choice for a good burger and fries on the run. Forger the over-hyped, under quality, horrendous fries and long lines at the In and Out burger and go to Culver's. There aren't many around, but it's worth the drive. Otherwise, Burger King is a better choice than In And Out any day of the week."}
{"text":"7/10 times they are gonna mess up your order. I had a piece of stone or some Black piece of some object end up in one of my pints of ice cream the owner called me himself and apologized and offered free meals for my family of course I declined the staff is friendly I would totally recommend this place I love Culver's"}
{"text":"Came for some ice cream. Flavor of the day. Not sure what it all actually was but it took care of my sweet tooth. Nice place to drive by and grab a meal or dessert."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to stopping at a local burger joint after a week in Wisconsin and Culver's did not disappoint.  Reasonable price $31 for a family of four as follows:
Bacon cheeseburger, fries, Oreo shake for the 12 year old boy.
Plain burger, waffle cone vanilla ice cream for 9 year old daughter 
Wife got a big chicken salad.
I got a big bacon cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato, red onion, fries, and a soft drink.

The fresh ground burgers lived up to the hype.  Much prefer that juiciness over what some of the more common fast food burger places claim to be meat.  Keep up the good work Culver's, I'll be coming back for more soon. (Hope there is one at MKE)"}
{"text":"Everything was good . I was looking for the meat to be bigger for the price . The ice cream was awesome . The food I felt it was overpriced"}
{"text":"This is the home of the butter burger and frozen custard. Both are fantastic. And for all you malt fans like me (most places only have shakes) they have some of the best here. This place is consistent, service is very friendly. Is it as good as the ones in Wisconsin? Probably not, but for Arizona, this is a great place for a burger."}
{"text":"Simply put, it's a glorified Sonic.  The burgers are okay, the custards are rather plan (And the mix-ins are skimped).  The place has been ridiculously crowded and the parking lot and especially the drive through were seriously under designed for any type of crowd (I am really disappointed that the city approved the design for the lot because it just doesn't work).  I don't get the draw to food covered in butter.  

Sonic has the same quality burger, ritters has much better custard (and no line) and neither have the wait."}
{"text":"I like to think of myself as an ice cream connoisseur, therefore this brief review only applies to Culver's two flavors of concrete mixers. Much to the disappointment of my man, I always get them sans candy mix-ins. The thick, smooth custard has no business being combined with candy- it is that good. Whether I am celebrating life or in dire need of ice cream, Culver's has my back. The only difficult decision: chocolate or vanilla?"}
{"text":"Culver's famous Butter Burger is a great step up from classic fast food options like McD's or BK's, but isn't at the same level as Red Robin, In-N-Out Burger, or Five Guys'. That being said, it is still delicious, and, since there are Culber's restaurants all over Wisconsin, it's convenient.

The real reason to go to Culver's is for their custard. Concrete mixers are where it's at, and, if you're not careful, you'll move to Wisconsin 40 pounds lighter than when you move out."}
{"text":"Wow, we stopped there  and it smells like urine, like dirty diapers that have been sitting for a couple of days that need to be thrown out.  I wanted to leave, the person I was with wanted to stay and eat, so we toughed it out.  It wasn't  pleasant at all, it was that nursing home smell mixed with urine.  Gross.   Our food was ok, the fries were nice and hot, very good, the burger was very very thin, pretty sure they don't use real bacon at least that's what it seems like, also very thin.    We ordered some concretes, I have to say I'll never get one of those again, my turtle concrete had pecans and ice cream. I expected it to have caramel and chocolate but there wasn't any at all, nor were there any pecans in the bottom half of the cup, only near the top.   It was like someone put the pecans in, gave it a little stir and served it.  Very disappointing, and certainly nowhere near another place we can the same product, only much better.  $25.00 for the both of us.  A little high for not so great food. I don't think we will visit there anytime soon, especially after the stench we experienced today."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good burger or other fast food item this is your place.  First heard of Culver's on a visit to our daughter's in Wisconsin and was glad they decided to come to AZ.  All around good food...make sure to save room for a concrete mixer...Monday thru Friday...2PM to 4PM is there BOGO.  Give it a try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First visit to this location...just as good as previous locations we have been to.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"The butter burger, definitely the standout here. It has the buttery taste of a diner burger, a la Pie & Burger, but slightly more processed.

Tried the fried cheese curd and they left a lot to be desired. Nothing compared to having fresh fried cheese curd in Wisconsin. They are over battered and taste like cheese product was injected into batter shells (yuck).

On a positive note the house root beer is good."}
{"text":"Tried the pepperjack pub burger and it was ok but I was not a huge fan of the bun. The staff was very friendly however and made the trip pleasant."}
{"text":"Ever swerve off the beltline so you can get off the Todd Dr exit? I have, several times for the love of Dollar Waffle Cones. They get me (mostly) every time! My husband cringes every time we drive near their sign cause he knows that I'm just waiting to read those blinking lights that say $1. He even says I always scream, \"Dollah waffle cone!!\" as I change lanes to the left. I don't think so. Sometimes, the sign isn't working but they'll still have $1 specials. You just gotta roll past the doors to see the taped up signs for the special of the day. I don't care what FOD (flavor of the day) it is, I love their custard. Been there and will be goin' back. Join the email list for coupons, news and a free scoop of ice cream on your birthday."}
{"text":"Waited 7.5 minutes to get to front of line to order food. Then told to wait before I could place my order. Screw that! I left and went to Chic-filet. If you are going to run a fast food restaurant, then be fast!! They need someone at HQ to wake up to how local stores are being run...poor customer experience at 11:15 in the morning before the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Culver's is awesome especially when it's open until midnight. I came here with some friends at 11 pm and the full menu was available. I had a delicious concrete mixer and the Wisconsin three cheese butter burger. It was all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Drive thru and wait with a number is a joke! Food over priced and will go to five guys or in n out burger instead!"}
{"text":"Frozen Custard is very smooth, it's really good! They also have burgers that beat other fast food places. They have cheese curds that are pretty good but I cannot compare as this is the only place I have had them. The food here is not bad and the Frozen Custard is smooth and delicious!"}
{"text":"They get 5 stars for customer speedy service,great ice cream,cleanliness, and satisfaction always guaranteed, indoor & outdoor seating. The fish meals or burgers are awesome.  Literally the kindest employees. Its close by and I end up here more often lately. I turned my daughter on to this place and now she's hooked. Its a treat to go get one of their many shakes or a beautiful banana split. I am happy to give them a great review because I have never had bad service. They bring the food to your table, they bring extra condiments if necessary. I just love good customer service and with these folks, its always great customer service. Thank you for going old school with care to the customer. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was elated when I searched yelp for places to eat near my office and found Culvers. I ate there two days in a row last week, and ordered the follwing:

bacon butter burger, lettuce style - SO DISAPPOINTED. I had high expectations for a burger cooked in butter. While not terrible, this is not even comparable with in-n-out.

chicken fingers - Decent, although I've been spoiled by Shane's BBQ tenders which are made in house. I'm assuming Culver's came frozen in a big bag and then were deep fried. Still, pretty good for fast food.

green beans - Not cooked nearly enough for my liking, forced down several fork-fulls then threw the rest away. 

Would only visit again if co-workers dragged me along. I'm sure I would have a different view of the place if I were in glutton mode chomping on the custard and french fries."}
{"text":"Custard is really amazing! The best part is their customer service. The girl who took our order knew we were first timers so she gave us a small menu just for custard. They brought custard right to us instead of yelling out names. I even saw the girl who helped us, Shanniah, go out of her way just to open up door for a man with two custard cups in hand. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I saw Culver's was offering a Colby Jack Pub Burger and add their delicious crinkle cut fries to the mix and I was sold.  I'm proud to say they did not disappoint.  I ordered a double patty CJPB.  The onion roll was delicious as were the patties but I was a little disappointed in the cheese.  There didn't seem to be a lot of cheese on it but it still tasted very good and I will order it again.  I'll just order extra cheese I guess.  I had my fries which tasted awesome and I saw that the flavor of the day was Mint Oreo so how can I pass up a concrete mixer?  I have yet to have a bad meal at Culver's.  Would I recommend the Colby Jack Pub Burger?  You bet.  Heck, I may have to order the triple patty."}
{"text":"Food not that great prices Are no bargain this place is not as good as it should be fried chicken is good but the pieces are very small and high price."}
{"text":"Stopped Sunday around 6:30 to get some concrete mixers with peanut butter cups in one and Andy mints in the other. What they provided was the dusting of candy  far less then 1/4 of a teaspoon and no pieces of any significance very disappointed    Quality appears to have gone down . The custard is why I gave it three stars"}
{"text":"Amazing Double Mushroom Burger with a Chocolate Concrete Mixer with Hot Fudge and Reese's Cups!!! Live life- don't count the calories!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Really great burgers is what gets me back here all the time.  The inside is always clean and the staff is good.  Food is always delivered to my table in a timely manner and it is hot and fresh.  The country music they play could be turned down a bit, but otherwise isn't too bad.  I haven't tried any of the frozen treats yet, but I hear they are great too."}
{"text":"Okay so first off my friend and I walk in around 3:30pm. It's was not busy at all, like one group of 3 in the dining room, and 2-3 cars in the drive through. The guys in the kitchen were working at a slow/normal pace. An employee who was just standing around basically drug himself over the cash register, after we were standing there for awhile. 

No smile, no greeting, just \"What can I get for you\" in a monotone voice. We ordered two concrete mixers, and he gave us our number (sluggishly). 

\"It will be out in a minute.\" 

Well. Okay. Thanks. Speaking they weren't even busy, wouldn't it be great to have a paying customer come in? 

I'm usually not too stingy or picky about these kind of things, but I also work in a fast food company, and I don't understand why every employee can act so miserable when it's not even busy. 

2 stars for the good concrete mixer. Probably won't be coming back to this location.

- UPDATE -
Down to one star because literally every employee is acting like they hate their lives. 4 more parties just came in and all of the workers never smiled once and took orders like it physically hurt them. Don't come here because you won't feel welcome.

The only perk? The bathrooms."}
{"text":"Great service, better food! This place is great. They provide excellent service with a smile."}
{"text":"I miss Culvers. I miss frozen custard. 
People in California think In and Out is the best, but they are just not familiar with Culvers."}
{"text":"Love the cheese curds and frozen custard, but nickel and diming for sauce... come on."}
{"text":"Culvers is always overpriced but tasty. Never disappoints. 

Fries, curds, pretzel bites(new), burgers, grilled cheese, chicken tenders...yummy"}
{"text":"So Incredibly disappointed at the total lack of any business sense they showed tonight. I went there with my 3 kids tonight and I forgot my wallet. I had a credit card in my truck that didn't work because I never use it, so I called my wife. 
They wanted to hold our food until my wife got there. I offered my I-Pad, and or truck keys as collateral and they still didn't budge. What a bunch of idiots. You've got a good customer who's in a little bit of a jam and he can't pay for his meal for 10 minutes and you don't just give him and his kids their food? Such incredible poor judgement. I was ticked off I left and we went to DQ instead."}
{"text":"I think Culver's is now my favorite fast-food joint! Their food and service is top notch, and the restaurant is always spotless. 
I don't do the drive-thru, so my review is based solely on dining there. The staff is always super friendly and some of the kids are really cool and funny. We once had a hilarious discussion about Star Trek with the girl at the counter. The staff treats you like friends! Also the General Manager is very hands-on and likes to interact with the guests and talk about the food. For instance he let us know: the burgers are always fresh, NEVER frozen. The custard is shipped 2000 miles daily. They make their own root beer. The fried chicken dinner is fresh DAILY...again, never frozen. The animals on their farms are treated humanely, and there are no antibiotics or hormones in the meat. Culver's cares! They are an environmentally friendly and sustainable company with a LEED certified building.  You can tell the ingredients and the food is a cut above other fast food places - the difference is in the fresh taste of everything; the staff there takes pride in this! 

Their menu is deceptively diverse - at first glance it just seems like you can order burgers with different combinations of toppings etc. But then you'll see things like chicken, pork cutlets, melts, reubens, fish etc... While they don't get all crazy like Jack in the Box, Culver's is probably tops for menu variety.  I've gotten several burgers there, and they never disappointed. While they are not the gourmet variety like Rehab or Delux, when compared to McDonald's or Burger King...there is no comparison, Culver's is way better. One of the secrets is that they sear the meat, and the edges have a tasty crispiness to them. I am a HUGE fan of the cheese curds - always my preferred side over the crinkle cut fries. Mmmm who doesn't love a bag of fried cheese curds that you can dip in ranch? Love it. Also, their famous custard has a well-deserved reputation. It is REALLY good. We've taken it home before too, or just had one there mixed with goodies like Reese pieces. Easily one of the best fast food desserts in the industry. I also love the fact that they make their own root beer, and it's served in the soda fountain; and it's really really good!   My girlfriend is a big fan of the melt sandwiches. I have tried the fried chicken dinner, and while I have had better (grandma's), for fast food I was quite surprised at what a full-sized dinner they served. 4 GIANT pieces of chicken, with cole slaw and fries. We have also eaten the fish there, and again, we recommend it. The fish sandwich is good - its North Atlantic cod, and sometimes they have a limited-time Walleye freshwater fish dinner which will knock your socks off. 

Fun and friendly service. Fresh, never frozen foods from Wisconsin. One of the better burgers you can get. Tasty cheese curds. Delicious custard for dessert. And surprisingly good meals like fish and fried chicken. And homemade root beer. yep... Culver's is easily the top 3 fast food chains on the planet right now."}
{"text":"The Culver's butter burger is good and the Culver's fries is excellent and the staff was nice to us and the service was good and the root beer was good. I will be returning to Culver's agin."}
{"text":"A  step above most fast food chains.
Sadly, I have to avoid dairy these days. Cheese decided it doesn't love me anymore.  Sad Panda. I am a sucker for fried cheese curds - and Culver's - being Wisconsin born and bred, uses real cheese from real cows. None of that processed \"cheese food product\" crap.
I'd love to be able to review the curds, and the cheeseburgers and the frozen custard - but for love of my good health, I just can't.
I opt for the burger. Sometimes the double. The bun (yes - I know it has butter - but that doesn't seem to effect me...) is way better than fast food places, but not as good as some of the great buns (Fez, Grind, etc.) The burgers taste like they are made from real cows - not all the fillers from some fast food chains.
Not a big fan of just how overtly Christian the place is - but that's what drive thrus are for - and I am there to eat, not get saved.
I'm just as likely to head over to Smashburger - but one of the coworkers loves Culver's, and is willing to go pick the food up for us.  So, Culver's it is.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"Two facts:
Culvers trumps In N Out.
Whoever compared Culvers to Dairy Queen is bonkers. they don't even compare

I have been hearing this dumb commercial about 'being culverized' on KTAR and all I could think was how dumb it was that we were getting commercials for places we don't even have.

ha, i was dumb. we do have a culvers!!! and i am now in love.

reasons why it's better than In N Out:
-while I love In N Outs meat patties, their cheese selection sucks. at culvers you pick your cheese- american, cheddar or swiss (i hate american cheese which is the only cheese offered at In N Out)
- They have red onion, i love both onions but red is way better
-I like their hamburger patties just a bit more than In N Outs(both are good)
- Culvers shakes and custard are totallllllyyyyyy better than any milkshake In N Out could ever make.
- I love all the options of burgers you can get at culvers! including bacon and if you dont want a burger their chicken strips look pretty awesome


 i am so excited i heard those dumb commercials and looked them up!!!!!!

i will say that In N Outs fries are way better than culvers.  but that's it."}
{"text":"Asked for 3 original burgers and they added cheese which we did not want. The tomatoes on the burgers were such bad quality they were crunchy and barely even pink in color let alone red. Girl gave us our ice cream (she called it ice cream even though it's allegedly custard) and then we waited over 5 minutes for our burgers. Basically the custard was melted by the time we got it home. Should use more thought when handing food to customer when you know it's 100 degrees outside. The Culver's we used to go to in IL was always a positive experience. This location needs to get it together.

Paid a lot for poor service."}
{"text":"The wait may take a little longer than other fast food restaurants but it's totally worth it! 
Real meat in the burgers, crunchy crinkle fries, and perfectly battered fish will not let you down. The custard is great and there are tons of flavors.
The cheese curds are growing in me lol."}
{"text":"The first time I had Culver's was in Chicago. They built one next to my house and every week after school me and my brothers went there. It's really good. They have all kind of foods. My favorite is the crispy chicken sandwich. They have burgers, chicken tenders, and fried chicken, soups, salads & ice cream. The kids meal comes with a free ice cream. Their custard is really good. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"Gr8 Service; Sundae & Waffle Cone were tasty & \"hit the spot\"; Very Clean; 1st time here, but won't be the last."}
{"text":"First time eating here.
Ordered the Pot Roast sandwich with a side Caesar salad and drink totaling $8.

I couldn't believe how tiny the sandwich was, looked like a kids meal or something off the 99 cent menu. It tasted ok but you could tell it was microwaved meat.
Then the salad...... Opened it up took a look and noticed the lettuce was limp and wilted and the cherry tomatoes skin was wrinkled. I ended up throwing it out. Called the restaurant number on the receipt and complain to the manager who offered my money back. I told her I wasn't driving back to waste my time or money on their restaurant again.
No wonder why the place always looks empty. 
I won't be back."}
{"text":"Really an ordinary burger , where's the meat on a single? The chili fries were horrible chili paste! The curds were so dry and mostly breading! I have to say I did like the shake so will return for ice cream only! The girl who brought food brought no shakes when I asked her for them she looked like we did not order them then returned with one when I said 2 she had to look on the receipt to be sure I wasn't lying to her! The place was so busy I thought it was going to be good that many people can't be wrong about the burgers can they! What a disappointment I am a big advocate for trying new places but this one does not get my vote!"}
{"text":"Great for fast food!!! I love that they have a gluten free bun option for the burgers. That is a huge plus for me and I will keep coming back. Plus not to many places give out free desert with the kids meals, got to love that if you have a family."}
{"text":"Even tho this is my first time ever eating at Culver's, I highly recommend their sourdough burger melt -- so good it melts in your mouth! And a shake... Can't go wrong with a shake!"}
{"text":"5/5 stars really explains it all. The place has excellent tasting \"butter burgers\" and every visit is pleasurable with the kind and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Mediocre burgers that suffer from poor meat quality; from a business that attempts to showcase burgers, this was simply a gigantic let-down. The sides were adequate, in that there are neither complaint or approval towards them. They exist.

The shakes and ice cream are the saving grace at this location. Occasionally poorly mixed, yet all around a solid choice on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Culver's is alright by me. I enjoyed the fresh ingredients on my burger and the clean, spacious atmosphere. There were numerous employees on hand to handle the fairly new Chandler restaurant. I've had better fries at McDonald's but I appreciate the comfortable atmosphere Culver's has established. I've never tried frozen custard before so that was a new experience. Boy, that stuff is THICK. It was a little too much for me as a dessert and I most likely will stop by here again for a burger or a custard but not both in the same meal, too much food!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Always good. I am so happy they came out from Wisconsin to bring is butterburgers and cheese curds!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Milwaukee Wi. So that is where I found custard it's so good.
The food and service is fast and good.
They have a nice choice on there menu.
But I have to say the Custard is so good and the reason I go here.
The cost is a good value.
Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We like to come to Culver's when we all can't decide on what to eat - they, actually have a pretty wide selection! We have tried hamburgers, grilled cheese, cheese curds, ice cream, fried chicken, and chicken strips (regular and buffalo). This food is not going to win any awards for its exemplary taste but it is a solid choice when you just want something fast. The fried chicken is surprisingly good - but be prepared to wait if you order it. The cheese curds are, hands down, our family fave. None of us really care for the ice cream here and so we typically skip that. 

The interior of the restaurant is nice and clean. It is a kid friendly set up which is another reason we come here."}
{"text":"Excellent all the way around! Very clean, great menu, great frozen custard, friendly service, reasonable prices....I'll never go to Micky D's again."}
{"text":"This Culver's no longer have Fried Chicken on their menu.  It was absolutely the only thing they had that was fresh and good.  The fish and shrimp are frozen out of a bag and dumped into grease and it taste awful. I will never ever step foot into a Culver's again.  NASTY FOOD."}
{"text":"Culver's is a step up from your typical fast food joints. It may be slightly more expensive but it's worth every penny! The food is yummy and the custard is my fav!"}
{"text":"This is your typical Culver's. Decent customer service and delicious, semi-fast food are expectations of mine when I visit a Culver's. I've never had bad service or a bad burger here! I will continue to go back once a month for my snack pack!"}
{"text":"Best burger around, great onion rings and delicious ice cream...er, I mean frozen custard."}
{"text":"Think Bob Evans decides to go fast food and you'll get a feel.  Culver's is a nicely appointed restaurant with salads, shakes, burgers, and chicken or fish sandwiches.  Not your McDs or Burger King kinda joint.   My experience was pleasant, the line moved along, and plenty of seating available.  I liked the TV'S in the dining area, too (which I typically loathe).

Granted the place opened recently so it's in great shape; morever, my salad was prepared well (not artisan level but solid), the chicken tender and tasty.  Tip: nutritional information posted on My Fitness Pal.  A guy named Dan visited each table when things slowed inspecting how they're doing.  Discovered later he was the owner, blue hat, shirt, and everything. I like that.

 I rarely eat much of their other stuff so I cannot comment, but if tempted I'd give that burger a try.  Or, the pot roast sandwich.  No, the fish.  Yes, with fries and a strawberry shake!"}
{"text":"Another sojourn to Culvers. Always good burgers. Great service this time. My order (same as before) arrived piping hot with crisp veggies, crunchy curds and a smile from the server. That's all you could ask for!"}
{"text":"Three years have passed. New management changed a few things. The TV is gone, the price for the same meal went up a buck but they discontinued the Frequent Guest Card. 

I'm not sure why you would remove a TV. The guests have always been predominantly seniors and they played CNN, which was a good match. 

The price increase was understood. It'd been three years since my last visit. It was still a good value. 

Eliminating the Frequent Guest Card baffles the brain. There was no way for anyone to cheat and it rewarded repeat visits. (Prominent head scratching). Not good marketing there. 

The food was the same, top quality I came to expect at Culver's."}
{"text":"First timer here and I must say I'm a fan. I had asked the workers what was the most popular meal and their favorite. Their suggestions were the grilled rueben sandwich, the cod fish and the  Culvers deluxe. So I ended up getting the rueben sandwich and my bf got the cod fish sandwich. Best suggestions ever. They were right on point, both sandwiches  were so delicious yet very flavorful.."}
{"text":"The pot roast sandwich is always a winner.  I happen to enjoy their chocolate malted milkshakes

Culvers is fast food for adults - great flavor; excellent quality and modest prices.  
We have become fans - when we need a quick lunch or a bit of dinner, Culver's is our #1 go-to spot - followed closely by Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Very pleasant and good service.  The restaurant was clean and bright.  I  have not been to Culvers in years.  It was a good experience.  The food could have been slightly better.  The burger patties are thin.  Cheese curds were good but expensive.  I would go here again even if it was just for a root beer shake."}
{"text":"Stopped in at around 6pm on 4/11/18. Only thing I ordered was a vanilla malt to go. On the drive home it made me very sick to my stomach. By the time I got home I had to puke. Afterwards I was immediately fine again."}
{"text":"Tonight I spent $9.28  for a burger, shake, and fries.  The service couldn't have been better.  Really nice people there and it was fast.  The restaurant was really clean, a plus with me.  The custard kind of shake was pretty good- haven't had one of that kind for awhile.  To be honest for what I paid, the burger really wasn't anything exceptional.  This surprised me as I seem to remember them being better.  Wonder what's happened there or if it was just me."}
{"text":"Really bad experience... i order 3 ice creams and after 30 min wait, I went to see why it was taking so long and they told me that they lost my order so they forgot to make  my ice cream. Not coming back"}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent, food was good. We all had burgers with cheese and fries. All items were hot and very good. My only complain was that everything seemed dirty. The bathrooms needed a good scrub and the floor and tables seemed to have a film of dirt/ grease on them. 
We did enjoy the food and service, we will visit another location near our house next time."}
{"text":"A few years ago I discovered Culver's while visiting my sisters in Austin. I fell in love. When I learned they were building one within a 10 minute drive from my house, well, I can't describe the feeling. It's actually a good thing that they aren't closer or I'd probably weigh about 20 more pounds than I do.

Anyway, Culver's has perfected the hamburger. Who else but a midwestern fast food chain would come up with the concept to dredge their hamburgers in butter before cooking them? They aren't those frozen uniform-sized patties either. My personal fave is the Swiss Mushroom variety but they have lots of other options as well. I hear the salads are good too - I just like the burgers too much to order anything different.

And their frozen custard is truly food of the gods. If you've never had frozen custard, you are in for a treat. It's like ice cream, but even more creamy with a slightly firmer texture. I tend to lean towards the turtle sundae which is assembled to perfection - vanilla custard topped with caramel, fudge and pecans.

They also have some very creative flavors of the day, including cheri amour amaretto, turtle cheesecake, bananas foster, caramel cashew, chocolate covered strawberry, apple pie... the list goes on and on.

The best part is that the prices aren't but a tad higher than you'd pay a McDonald's. Our family of 4 (which includes 2 teenage boys) can usually dine there for about $30 including dessert."}
{"text":"Their chicken strips are delicious! I don't know why I've never ordered them, but they're great. I like their in house root beer. It's one of my favorites. I wasn't super wowed by their chicken salads. They were just okay. My kids ate all their food, which is super rare. These picky kids definitely loved it. It was super super busy after church hours on a Sunday, so beware."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter which location I go to, they are all consistent, I love and appreciate that. I'm not a hamburger eater, I can take it or leave it except when I see a Culver I start salivating."}
{"text":"Yuck!! totally not going back. Mcdonalds way bette than this. and I'm shocked someone compared this to In N Out...no way! I wish it were in n out"}
{"text":"Woo. Okay. That's right folks, FIVE STARS. First time for everything...

Culver's, THANK YOU for making your burgers so greasy and soft and fluffy and nice.


I am currently blighted by strep throat. Swallowing hurts. Drinking water hurts. MY FAVORITE FOODS ARE HURTING ME. I thought I could not enjoy life. So after going through a full workday, plagued by this curse, I thought \"Why not? I will have Culvers for dinner. I do not want to cook delicious food that will hurt me.\"

That double Delux was the best choice I made all day. Chewy, soft, and kind to my throat the whole way...that burger was the first meal I've enjoyed all week. 

I literally enjoyed that burger so much I think it will become a ritualistic meal every time I get a sore throat. Already debating having another one tomorrow.

You were the real MVP today Culver's. Don't change for the world."}
{"text":"If you have not tried the cheese curds or custard here then you are missing out. I'm not a huge fan of the burgers, but they are good. They taste very fresh. It's worth a visit to try the cheese curds and custard. Life changing."}
{"text":"The girl who works drive thru, a rounder white girl (not sure of the name) is probably the rudest person I've encountered. The sweet angel who brought my food out was great, though. It was her first day and she deserves everything. 4 stars still, cuz I love this food."}
{"text":"I know a lot of Wisconsonites love Culvers. I just wish they had more healthy choices. I tried their chicken salad and it was not fresh as they advertise. It looked like it was made in the morning and sat all day until I ordered it at 4:00 pm. I should have taken it back to the counter and ordered something else. Tried their grilled chicken sandwich and pot roast sandwich, not impressed. On the positive side the french fries are very good as is the fish sandwich. This restaurant isn't always clean with straws and napkins all over the floor. I hate it when they bring out the sweeper and sweep around your feet when you're trying to enjoy your meal. The staff is friendly. In the summer the patio is relaxing."}
{"text":"Typical Culver's. 
Food is always tasty and hot (because I always have to pull forward and park)."}
{"text":"The nicest most customer friendly fast food place I've ever been to. The food is great, fairly priced, and service was quick. We'll be coming back for sure, these guys are the future of fast food! Shoutout to Dan the owner who was super friendly to us as well!"}
{"text":"Love love love Culvers.  Not 5 stars bec they forgot four items and had to go back for 2 of them the other night.  They were friendly and they apologized  The food was fresh as always."}
{"text":"Hands down Culver's has the best cod filet sandwiches of all the fast food restaurants. My wife had chicken tenders and said they were the best she had anywhere.  Hot fresh Frys friendly servers and efficient service.  Clean premises with several TVS too."}
{"text":"I love their butter burgers, cheese curds and of course their custard.  Yummy.  Best burger around."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places in town!  The burgers are fresh and served hot!  I always get the snack-pack!  Great price and just enough food.  The root beer is wonderful!  We frequent this spot about once a week...especially during track season!"}
{"text":"Don't know what is wrong with this location. Second time there, second time disappointed.  We ordered fish and chips.  The cod \"looked\" yummy, however, there was ZERO seasoning on the fish or in the batter which was verrrry greasy.  The poor fish fillets were quite nice and should have been tasty, but they were sadly mistreated.  The cole slaw had a strange after taste and the more fries we ate, the less we enjoyed them.  My plate had a giant hole in the bottom, which I was fortunate enough to find before squeezing lemon and pouring malt vinegar.  It could have been such an ugly mess!

The staff was pleasant and the restaurant was clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Wow when did a meal here cost almost 10$ and I got paper thin sourdough burger with greasy toast super disappointed will not return"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have not had their food. I simply wanted ice cream. Their drive through process is so screwed up that getting ice cream is a pain- I can't imagine trying to wait for food with this set up. There is only room for maybe 1 or 2 cars to wait behind the person ordering in the drive through. Once you order you drive to the window and pay, then they toss a number at you and make you drive around to the front of the building. After 15 minutes (keep in mind we ordered one up of ice cream) I went inside to see what the issue was, only to find that they never brought it out to us and it was melted all down the side of the cup."}
{"text":"So it's the Saturday after Thanksgiving and all through the house  - BURGERS NOT TURKEY we all cried out! This place is close to my Mom's and allowed us an easy way to get some grub to go and allow the cook a day off. We hopped onto the website, made a list (checked it twice) for the 10 of us, and then three of us cruised over to make the order and pickup. OMG. I'm still dreaming of this place. Too bad it's a 5 hour drive....I could REALLY go for another burger from this place! My husband and I both indulged in the Culver's Bacon Deluxe, and everyone ordered a smattering of other burgers plus 8 orders of fries. We avoided the Cheese Curds because it seemed a lot of other reviewers weren't too pleased with them. Oh, there was also an order of onion rings but I didn't get to sample those. Our only \"issue\" if you will is that we requested all of the burgers be single patties and realized when we got home and unwrapped them all they were double patties - but don't worry - I still CAN'T BELIEVE I ATE THE WHOLE THING. It was SO good!!! I think there was only one in the group who felt his wasn't what we ordered ( hey, we went off of the list) but I was in seventh heaven. The place was more fast food-ish than I had pictured when we first walked in but I don't care, the food was delish and the service was pretty fast. My husband also split his chocolate malt with me which was very, VERY good. I guess I'll just keep dreaming of this burger until my next visit - but thank you Culver's for a delicious \"last meal\" with the family before we hit the road that day to head home."}
{"text":"\"A glorious experience\" is hardly enough to describe my visit to this Culver's. 

Ever had a team of hungry kids that can't agree on a stinking thing and need an affordable meal?  Just take them to Culver's and the complaining stops. The service is fast, the food is delicious and hot, there is a wide selection of delectable foods (cheese curds and custard CAN go together), the butterburger mind blowing, and the prices affordable. 

There is plenty of seating for that team of yours to sit down. Coaches, you can trust that they will be well-fed while you enjoy your melty cheese curds from the other side of a planter box and watch whatever marquee sporting event is on one of several flat screen TVs. 

If you've got a long bus ride after, be confident knowing your kids are probably exhausted from competing and have a full belly - they are going to be unconscious in a frozen custard coma in under 12 parsecs.  Maybe it's just my Wisconsin roots that makes this Mecca of food so awesome to me. Forget it. I'm writing off custard on my taxes as a business expense."}
{"text":"Culvers = one happy belly! I grew up in Wisconsin and to be driving down the street in Arizona to see a Culvers made me hook a U-Turn! 

I hadn't been to a Culver's in years. This brought back memories! I watched with much delight to see this restaurant grow across Wisconsin. And now to different states.

Their custards are delicious. Their cheese curds =awesome bite sizes of delight. Burgers are tasty. Their restaurants are always clean. They even have a dedicated person who works the floor with a broom and cleans up after people. 

Each day they offer a flavor of the day for custards. 

Simply good stuff here."}
{"text":"I gotta grab me some Culver's whenever I have a chance. It reminds me of Wisconsin...and growing up there. Having a treat at Culver's was a big deal.

I stopped at this location on my way back to San Diego. Not a bad location. Near an off ramp.

The day that we stopped in the grill was not working so no butter burgers to be had. I wasn't too upset. After all, I was able to have my vanilla custard turtle sundae.

This is not your typical sundae made with vanilla ice cream, it is made with rich frozen custard. After eating one, you could simply die happy and in a food coma.

This location was also pretty clean, to the point that it felt like the floor had been just waxed and a bit slipe n slide like."}
{"text":"Love me some Culvers! I grew up in Wisconsin where Culvers orginates from. So visiting a Culvers in AZ is a small bit of home.

The cheese curds are tasty too. Not as tasty as the ones that you can buy at the Wisconsin State Fair battered in beer. The batter at Culvers has a bit more of a grainy texture. But the cheese still tastes amazing.

I love the turtle sundaes here. The caramel and fudge with salted pecans on frozen custard. Mouth watering goodness. Dangerously unhealthy...so I am very glad that Culvers in not anywhere close to where I live. Instead it is 100's of miles away

I have been here several times. This location is clean. The service is ok. There is a central seating area with a TV. They also have a seating area outside. 

This restaurant is located in a newer strip mall that does not have all the retail spaces rented out yet. However Firehouse Subs is right across the parking lot. And a few other retail stores. And this is not too far from the freeway. Easy access to get your frozen custard!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! The fries are fresh and excellent.
The ketchup is yummy and the honey mustard sauce is super flavorful and spicy! 
I had the chicken and fries, my family had the fish and shrimp - and it was all presented so well and professional. The quality was fresh and excellent and the customer service was ambitious and friendly. 
We are definitely coming here again in the future."}
{"text":"This Culver's location just opened up in my neighborhood so I ventured in.  The entire staff was working.  They were completely over staffed.  I guess it is better to be safe than sorry for a grand opening.  There was not a line so I walked right up to the cashier and ordered a Deluxe Double Burger.  I was up sold from fries to cheese curds.  I asked the cashier were this business started and she told me Wisconsin.  She tried to sell me custard too.  I said no.  I took my number, went to the soda fountain and filled my cup with Culver's own Root Beer.  I sat down and waited for my burger and cheese curds.  Of course the place was clean, it is brand new.  (Lets see if it stays that way)  They have a large flat screen that was playing sports.  The walls had Biblical quotes from Proverbs.  Am I in the banquet hall from the church next door?  I quickly looked under my cup to see if there were anymore quotes.  No quotes.  It did have a question though.  \"What flavor are you?\"  Gee!! I don't know, Spicy Mexican maybe.  My burger came and it was wet with oil or butter or water.  It was juicy.  Not a bad burger but not great.  The cheese curds were nice.  I like cheese, and the fact that it is battered and deep fried is all the more sinful.  My arteries were screaming at me and saying \"why are you eating this?\"  I enjoyed the Root Beer.  I went for a refill on my way out.  The total for my meal was $7.79.  I will go back to Culver's but not often.  My craving for cheese curd will have to kick in for me to go back.  A-OK."}
{"text":"I have been seeing this place popping up all over the valley and I had to stop here once.  This place left a great taste in my mouth with the flavor of the foods and the great friendly service.  The cashier explained the menu to me since it was my first time here and I had never been here.  The manager cruised by to check on us and the place is extremely clean."}
{"text":"I LOVE CULVER'S!!!!  It's from the midwest.  I had not tried Culver's until I met my now husband(he's from Illinois), who introduced me to this awesome place.  Since that first meeting, I was hooked.  Now locations are popping up everywhere.  I love it.  

They are best known for their Butter Burgers and their Custard.  Me, personally, I will go there just for the custard.  I recommend a small or medium chocolate custard concrete mixer with brownie pieces.  Yummy!!!  Don't get a large, because that is way too much, you'll get a tummy ache.  If ever I'm feeling down, I will always turn to Culver's.  Their butter burgers are good as well.  Low fat and low in calories....Yeah right.  But they sure are tasty.  

My friend is from Wisconsin and will go here just for the cheese curds.  

Culver's is a place to go once in awhile as a treat to yourself, because the prices are little on the high side.  Besides you don't want to spoil yourself too much, otherwise you might lose appreciation for it.  Definitely go here."}
{"text":"Burger was cold by the time we got home. Drive through had 5 of us waiting. We were the waiting the longest but all 5 of us got our food at the same time. Nice to know my food is cold b/c it was sitting on the counter longest."}
{"text":"I guess the bloom is off the rose a bit.

A year ago, when I told our Wisconsin friends that Culvers was opening restaurants down here, they collectively yawned.  Now it's been almost a year since the PV store opened and maybe seven months for this location.  Culver's still gets busy during lunch and dinner, but things have slowed down in a big way.  Maybe it was just the Portillo's effect? Maybe.

Culver's is basically a good frozen custard place that does a nice business with burgers and fries.  Yes, there are Rubens and Chicken sandwiches as well, but they're known for their custards, which are delicious.

On the hamburger front as I said they do a nice job...  but...  you knew there was going to be a but in here someplace right?  Well, the hamburgers are.. greasy.  I was here recently with some out of town friends and their napkins were soaked.  One actually removed the top of the bun to tap it dry.

So after nearly a year, I'll take a pass here and go back to my Animal Style."}
{"text":"The fish sandwich was sooo disapointing. Too much breading & very little fish. Was like eating a feather. Not healthy."}
{"text":"The advertising about the fish burger was what caused me to order. Horrible. Very little fish with very little taste. I could taste the refined bun, greasy fish and all the junk they put on the fish. Awful."}
{"text":"I will say this, had they been kinder towards me when I was ordering I would of rated them higher. 
I took my daughter and two young boys through the drive thru to get ice cream  but my boys 5&6 decided they wanted a kids meal burger. First time here I asked her and let her know \"Hey First time here!\" Her response, well let me know when your ready?  Of course I have questions. Besides the bad attitude we ordered 2 kid burger meals 3 Oreo shakes and 1 vanilla cone."}
{"text":"Oh Culvers - you evil temptress...

I really REALLY try to avoid fast food, but if there is one fast food place that I find hard to resist, it's Culvers.  Those butter burgers are just so tasty - and the frozen custard - reminds me of Shake Shack in NYC, really tasty when you mix in some fruit or plop a scoop in their own brand of root beer.  Speaking of the root beer, I love when restaurants make their own root beer, especially when they do a diet version.  I always hate when my options are Coke or Coke.  

I try to be health conscious when I walk into this place.  If you review their website, they have a smart choice area where they give you some lower calorie options that you can put together for a sensible meal. 

 A lot of reviews note that its lots of butter and fat, it might be because the options can be overwhelming when you first walk in, with most options being on the heavy duty side.  Be smart, take 2 minutes before you go and review the nutritional info.  

I have also seen several orders here come out wrong and so I will agree that you should double check your order if you take out to make sure everything is correct.  However, last I checked, this is a fast food joint outside of an amusement park, not Dean and Deluca.  Its a big menu, and unfortunately, when its a \"have it your way\" style establishment, orders are going to be wrong.  Besides, its the south, no one ever gets your order right..."}
{"text":"I'm from Wisconsin so Culver's is a little piece of home to me.  Midwest meats make the patties for the delicious butter burgers... yes, butter makes those burgers SOOO delicious.
The dairy to make the custard is from wisconsin, the cheese curds to make the fried cheese curds are from wisconsin... it's too good!

There's always vanilla custard, chocolate custard and flavor of the day.  And when I say custard I don't mean ice cream or anything like it... it's FAR better, creamier and more flavorful!  Check their website or drive by to see what the flavor of the day is.

Also, join their email list and get amazing coupons!!

LOVE the food. The service is great. The prices are amazing.  AND ITS ALL FROM WISCONSIN!!"}
{"text":"I died and went to heaven! I have not been able to find Wisconsin Cheese curds anywhere near home. The closest place was Wisconsin! Not anymore! I found my that this place is as good as the original. The food is cooked to order, and is absolutely amazing. I had the butter burger, the way I like it, and couldn't have been happier. They really need to get one out here in Las Vegas. Just saying!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here quite often. The service is quick, staff is friendly, and the food is great(:

It's a bit pricey, but overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Clean, friendly service. But the overuse of \"um\" among the wait staff is annoying. Teenagers, you know."}
{"text":"My son loves the cheese curds. Alittle pricey but always good. The concrete custards are soooooo yummy. You have to get it. Check out the flavor of the day so u know what's up. Good food and very kind service. Thanks."}
{"text":"Worst location. Terrible service! I've been to this location twice and they have no clue what they are doing. I ordered a plain cheeseburger and they gave me a hamburger. They gave no condiments at all. Last time I came here I waited 25 minutes in my car before finally going inside and getting a refund. CLEAN It Up Culver's or you'll have seen the last of me. I don't care if your foods good or not."}
{"text":"WHAT.WHAT. The home of the Butter Burger(named so because the bun is buttered). These Burgers are made to order and will Karate chop your taste buds in the best way possible. The cheese curds will judo flip your buds as well. This place is giving my beloved In-N-Out a serious run for it's money. Would be 5 stars but it is a little pricey around $9 for a meal. But the service is superb (they bring your food out to you and will even pick it up for you and throw your trash away). Soleed man Soleed."}
{"text":"Food is good for the kind they sell (my husband loves the fries and the burgers). While not the healthiest, the cheese curds are also really good. Went through the drive through tonight and was helped by Gifford who was very friendly, patient, and helpful."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty bad - bordering on gross.

We went for the first time on a Saturday night.  It was pretty busy, a bit dirty (tables not clean, trash on floor) and the menu is pretty large and overwhelming.  When I finally got my three kids to tell me what they wanted I went up and ordered.  

Wow!  For fast food that was pricey!  

My husband ordered a burger and fries.  He then realized from the nutritional menu I picked up that the fries were not gluten free so he couldn't eat them.

I had a veggie burger with cheese and mushrooms.  I almost couldn't eat it.  It was the worst veggie burger I had ever had.  I also tried the cheese curd - a mix of yellow and white cheese, deep fried and they offered me packets of BBQ sauce or ranch to dip them in.  They were not good.  I don't recommend them.

The custard was the only thing that wasn't bad but I don't think I will be able to stomach going back to get it again."}
{"text":"I just don't understand why people like this chain.  I believe this was the third location I have ever tried.  I try to not overdo it on calories so went with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The green beans were only half full in the container and the potatoes tasted just like cheap instant.  This was not a fast food cheap meal and i barely got any food and what i had was sub par.

Kids had burgers, chicken, fries, etc and enjoyed sitting on the patio with friends to eat."}
{"text":"I have given this place way too many chances it is disgusting to have burned over cooked meat on a burger !!!!  its gross I have decided that I will never be back to this company culvers even for ice cream if I can't get a burger cooked  the way I want it cooked that I don't need to go to this fucking business ever again"}
{"text":"I way over-are!! Everything was delicious!  The burger was buttery as they advertised, their fries were yummy and oh my... their malt was to die for!!! I am ready to nap after eating all of that!!!"}
{"text":"I don't mind the ol' Culvers. The food is indeed incredibly greasy and unhealthy so those on a diet should completely avoid it, and for others it should DEFINITELY be a very rare treat. However, it tastes pretty good. I myself would rank it above Five Guys, but below In-N-Out. Fries are okayish, but I'm a big fan of their bacon deluxe burger. The place is clean and has a lot of space inside. Has a very high snowbird factor during the winter months, but then again what place this close to Sun City doesn't? Kid loves the cheese butterburger and the fact that with every kids meal you get a free voucher for a scoop of their custard.

Went here on the weekend. Service reasonably fast at the counter and they bring the meal out to you. However, this particular time, when I went back to the counter to get the free scoop of custard there was nobody serving. I waited there tapping my foot for about 2 mins or longer before the fry chef behind the rear window called to me to check if I was being attended to. I said no and he said someone would be with me shortly. Servers came and went behind the counter. Eventually a gent who I assumed was the manager on duty strode behind the counter and asked if someone was helping me. I said no and he briefly looked exasperated before he took the order (politely). Placed the order, went back to my table to wait. Five mins later, still no custard (usually it's out in a min or two). Same guy is passing by, and goes \"Nobody's brought your custard out yet?!\" I said no meekly. He goes \"AARGH! I'm so sorry about this!\" and strides back to the kitchen area. Comes out seconds later with my custard, apologises for the tardiness and gives me a little token for a free scoop that I can use anytime. Nice gesture. This was a one-off and such things happen - the place certainly isn't as shitapple as the McDonalds a couple hundred yards west - but I must admit I was surprised that nobody was stationed permanently behind the counter. They need to vet their teenagers a little better during the hiring process I'm thinking, and not give the order-takers anything else to do except take orders. Anyway, a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"ive never waited for more than 20 mins at a fast food burger place. i kept telling my wife that it was a good sign and that it just means that the food will be super fresh. not so much. the fries were prob reheated at least twice as they looked old and the burger meat was on the cold side as well. ill just stick to freddys or in-n-out!!"}
{"text":"Gotta love the cheese curds! Burgers are great & chicken tenders are great. It's like they deep fry them in butter!"}
{"text":"Service here is lacking compared to most other Culver's I've been to. Employees aren't as friendly or helpful. The single scoop ice cream cones are also significantly smaller scoops than what you get in Middleton. I love Culver's and love the food, but I stick to the Middleton location because of these issues."}
{"text":"I love this place. So many options when it comes to side dishes.  Instead of just frys. As far as the custard goes. Their is many options you can do as far as topping. It's. It close to me but I don't mind taking the drive."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Classic Double with fried cheese curds.  I was less than pleased with the confusing drive-thru situation and waiting time, but it was all ok once I got back to my office and saw/tasted the food.

The burger actually looks like it does in the picture and tasted just as great.  The burger was not too greasy, was full of flavor, and was held together perfectly with the bun thus no mess all over my desk and pants.  The cheese curds were also very good and pretty much what I expected from fried cheese.

I would definitely return."}
{"text":"My parents flip their shit for any cookie dough flavor here.
I, however, wasn't all that impressed. The dough itself is fine (how can you fuck that up, really?), but the custard is kinda runny and watery and just rather blah.
Maybe I'm an ice cream girl? I recall enjoying Michael's when I was younger, so there goes that argument . . . slightly.
Basically, if you're going to get a frozen treat in the Madison environs, just do yourself a favor and get Babcock Hall ice cream."}
{"text":"Growing up in Nebraska, I had a vague recollection of Culver's so I stopped in this location for a blast from the past.  The burgers are great, with a few not so traditional fast food menu items included.  But I keep going with the classic butterburger (they butter/toast their buns), and if I'm in the mood I'll top it off with some 5* frozen custard (check out their website for their \"flavor of the day\").

Lunchtime can be downright cutthroat when it comes to finding a table to sit at, the umbrella shaded patio was suprisingly tolerable on a 100+ degree afternoon."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Culver's in a while, so I went through the drive thru around 3:30 on a Wednesday afternoon. I ordered a simple burger combo, paid at the window and pulled up to their order delivery area. A high school band was playing outside so I was enjoying the music until I realized no one had come out in a while for the 2 cars that were waiting (me included). I looked at my receipt and realized it had been over 20 minutes. Realizing this was beyond ridiculous I pulled back to the window and asked for a refund. At this point I wasn't in the mood to even take the food if it was ready at that moment. A manager was summoned to process the refund and it seemed very routine to them. There was no explanation offered as to why the 2 of us waiting for our orders were ignored for nearly half an hour. Just a \"sorry about that, have a nice day\". A bizarre experience, of which I don't see myself chancing a repeat anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"First time ever to a Culver's.   Mushroom burger was very bland and tasteless.  The meat was not seasoned in any way.  I had to put salt and pepper on it and it was still somewhat bland.  We were there for lunch and the entire restaurant was full of customers over 70.  Must be the area demographics.   

The frozen custard was good and the customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service ever!

There was an elder couple on a double date in-front of us and the young girl taking the order was rolling her eyes and was being extremely rude to them cause they where asking about their coupons
She kinda grabbed them with an attitude and said well what do you want listen i get it if you are tired or upset but chill out they are older people respect them there is no reason when they are being super nice to you!!!
Then the lady who was serving us had literally the most miserable i hate my job and people face on even though i was smiling and asking about some of the food items and it looked like it was just one of those days but come on im paying 40.00 give me a smile or something
Then i ask for no onions cause i don't like them and then they slather it up with onion wtffffff
Now im kinda super annoyed rn   

Get it together this is not right 
Hopefully you guys take this into consideration"}
{"text":"so i order in this branch, and buy a mushroom & swiss burger and when i look inside of the burger its only 2 pcs of mushroom woww!!! unbelievable !!!! and its was so dry!!! not gonna buy here anymore"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the entrees so much (they are too salty for me), but the Frozen Custard is always great."}
{"text":"Under new management and the Concrete Mixers have gone Downhill.  I have been going to this fast food restaurant for about 5 years at least once a month, sometimes more. When I went last night and ordered my favorite Concrete Mixer, I almost went back to the counter and told them that I thought they forgot the m&m's.  That's how few there were.  For my other topping, I asked for chocolate...I can only say that the vanilla ice cream was still the same color as before the chocolate was added. The ice cream was soft and I ate inside.  It will be a long time before I return."}
{"text":"Descent for fast food. The meat was fresh and juicy. Ingredients seemed fresh. One of our orders was wrong but they corrected it promptly and politely. No complaints but nothing amazing either. Good for what it is."}
{"text":"We went to Culver's this past Saturday night, and it was great!

When we lived in Illinois, Culver's was the big thing up in Wisconsin.  Well, through an aggressive expansion program Culver's is now being rolled out across the country and has finally made it to AZ.  

Given the quality of the food and service, you would have thought they would have started in California, but happily they've chosen the KISS method.  Just good Midwestern values I guess.

As the local WI media has put it, Culver's is:  \"the Prairie du Sac-based franchise chain...The company opened 23 new restaurants last year, and now operates 395 locations in 17 states, with all but eight of them owned by franchise operators. Another 20 restaurants are expected to open this year.\"  

Hey, I don't care at this point what they are.  \"Franchise chain\" seems somewhat repetitious, or is it redundant?  Anyway, the food is great!.  But I've said that already, right?  But, it really, really is!

Culver's butter burgers are outstanding.  Think \"In 'n Out\", but with a Wisconsin dairy spin to it.  

We ordered, one single Butter Burger Meal, including Fries and Drink for $4.79; one Double Burger for $4.29, a medium Chocolate Shake for $3.49, a large Malt for $4.29 and it all came to $18.43, including tax.  The Shake and Malt were made from their Frozen Custard.  Delicious.

So, in summary -- great value, great food!

PS -- Text 50101 with a \"JOIN CUILVERS440\" message to join their eClub.  Nice!

PSS -- They need a bigger parking lot.  Way bigger!

PSSS--  After reading my review, one of my Illinois friends told me we need to go back and try their Reuben sandwich or Pot-roast meal!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was pretty decent considering it's fast food. Dined in and our food came out super fast! Don't have crazy high expectations especially considering it is fast food, but I would rather eat here than the monster fast food chains like McDonald's or Burger King. Better selection, better service."}
{"text":"As part my introduction to Wisconsin culture, I had my first taste of fried cheese curd. They were hot out of the fryer, not too greasy and delicious. 

Staff were welcoming and helpful, dining area clean and comfortable. If I had more time during my visit, I would've returned to try more of their menu - i.e. burgers, sandwiches, salads, and frozen custard sundaes. Wish there were a Culver's closer to San Francisco."}
{"text":"Great food,great people, great experience overall...culvers is awesome.. cheese curds and custard are great..and their root beer is really good as well"}
{"text":"Culver's is great fast food. Good burgers, lots of other menu items, custard instead of ice cream. If you haven't had Culver's - you'll probably like it as it's terribly wonderful junk fast food that is very yummy. 

Now, this particular location is nice, good size, nice location, clean, friendly. BUT skip the DRIVE THRU completely! They almost ALWAYS get your order wrong! I think they've gotten mine right once in the last 5 visits. It's exhausting really. I don't know if they aren't listening or if their intercom just sucks, but it's downright terrible. 

Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"A new chain to South Carolina that I spotted when I went to a nearby restaurant, after I saw Jeff S's review that they have yummy reubens, I had to try it out.  

On a Friday at 11:30, the place was already hoppin'. If you are coming down 77 S to get here via the Carowinds exit, get in the center lane and go through the light and you'll be at Culver's front door.  The parking lot was pretty much full, but I found parking at the back and once inside they keep everyone moving and there is a ton of seating - high tops, tables, booths (both small and large) and a few tables and chairs outside.   Their drive thru was also very busy.   

The menu is LARGE, but very easy to read and figure out.  (I checked it out online before I went, so I already knew what I was getting).  Place your order at the counter, get a plastic stand-up number thing for your table.  Head around the corner to get your drink, napkins and straws and head to your table and wait for your food to be delivered.

The food:
Reuben:  Jeff S. was right, it was delicious.  The corned beef was tender and not stringy.  I wish the bread had been grilled a smidge longer, but it was good.  I also wish I had eaten that first - I hadn't had a reuben for a good while and I forgot that the longer they sit, the soggier they get.  Still, a delicious sandwich. 
Side salad:  Typical bag salad mix with a few juicy cherry tomatoes and a thick slice of cucumber.  Salad was crisp and fresh, no brown or wilted items in it.  Served with Culver's ranch dressing, which tasted like ranch dressing, nothing wow'y.  Served with heavy duty plastic utensils so you can actually cut and stab the salad.  (thank you!)
Cheese curds:  Piping hot with a thickish crust over melted cheese.  Fried and cheese are my two of favorite food groups, so of course I inhaled these.  I thought they were well-flavored and yummy.
Drink:  Culver's Root Beer - YUM!
Dessert:  Vanilla Concrete Mixer with Oreo.  What is a concrete mixer, you ask?  It's another delicious version of a DQ Blizzard.  Creaminess with Oreos.  YUM!

The grand total was $16 - which is kinda of high, but I had a boatload of food, including the small Concrete Mixer, which was $3.80 w/ tax.  Everything seemed to be freshly prepared, was well flavored and promptly delivered.  The entire staff was so incredibly friendly!  Varying in ages from teenagers (none of which rolled their eyes or gave a 'tude) to seniors, which I think is fantastic (the older folks of course being the MOST friendly, but everyone was very nice and seemed genuinely happy to help).  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times now and everytime it has been amazing! So glad to have a Culvers so close to home!"}
{"text":"Heavy heavy food, too greasy for me. Flavors were good, but it hurt. Workers are great and the place is huge!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with their deluxe cheeseburger. There was just not much flavor, and even adding salt and mustard did not help. The bun stuck to the box on both my wife's, and my burger. This made it very messy to eat."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is friendly, but if using the drive through make sure to physically check your order, don't just confirm using your receipt. On two of the three occasions I've gotten home to find problems with my drive through order."}
{"text":"Blech. I was running an errand during lunchtime and decided to run through their drive through to pick up a quick bite to eat - I had heard that the food was good from friends. Uncharacteristically, I ordered the chicken strips, fries and an iced tea. The chicken, while crispy, had no flavor in the breading except for an overwhelming amount of salt. The chicken was juicy with a chemically tinged juice. And worst of all, they were cold in the middle. I ate one bite, took a second and literally had to spit it out. Disgusting.

The fries were oversalted and greasy. Nice crunch though. Finished maybe 1/4 of them before I just couldn't eat anymore. 

Iced tea was good, but all of the ice was melted by the time I had taken 2 sips. Note to staff - real brewed iced tea is awesome, but it is warm, so you need to fill the cup ALL the way with ice. 

Never again. Ick ick ick."}
{"text":"You're a senior citizen from Sarasota enjoying a guided bus tour of all the wonders of central Illinois.  You have discerning taste and a penchant for adventure.  You ARE on a bus, aren't you?  

Arby's?  Too mainstream.  Fagioli's?  Too ethnic.

Enter Culver's.  Something delicious for everyone.  And the food arrives hot and fresh with a smile. 

don't be offended if the staff doesn't look you directly in the eyes.  They've been told that the Dementors from the Harry Potter books were based on old people."}
{"text":"Just like I'm in Wisconsin. Right down to the friendly staff. Terrific burgers, fries, salads, all sorts of dinner meals, & frozen custard.

Not exactly diet food but, great food fast."}
{"text":"Good food, my only complaint is why does the womens bathroom have no seat covers? That is so unsanitary."}
{"text":"Thought we would grab some dessert on the way back to the hotel from sushi.  No custard chains that i know of in Cali so why not give it a shot.  Could have definitely done without!  Nothing special, super sweet and consistency was more like melted ice cream.  Reminds me of a Dairy Queen or Fosters Freeze with the combination of a hot food menu.  You can tell the workers were definitely not excited to be their on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"After almost passing out in JCrew.. I know I needed sugar.. The bad cheating type that I am... I saw Culvers & almost took out 3 vehicles to make the mad swerve in for sugar & creme.. And all things nice.. No bad! Bad! :-) I was good to order the small Bananas Foster custard sundae... I heard the bells toll when I took my first bite... And I ate half.. For me.. A little does alot.. Yum...it's so rich, you don't need a ton of this treat!!"}
{"text":"This ice cream is bomb diggity! I had it for the first time tonight because apparently my wife knew how delicious it was, and knew i would always want to go there if i tried it. This icecream causes and is well worth the marital strife."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I fell in love with it. Great food, atmosphere. Very clean and friendly staff, definitely a return too."}
{"text":"I understand this is a big burger chain the Midwest and there is a dedicated fan base for it. I got introduced to Culver's a few years ago when this location opened up on Seventh Street and Camelback. Had to see what all the hype was about. It's a decent burger joint and their milkshakes and blizzard type ice cream is made with custard. Burgers are a little greasy but everybody raves about the butter burger. Service is good."}
{"text":"Reliably delicious.  Burgers are really  yummy, custard is off the hook, i love being able to get mashed potatoes or something different with my burger.  I had the pot roast sandwich once and it was stuffed with the pot roast such that i had to take some off.  Could've used a sauce.  The menu really does have something for everyone."}
{"text":"First time Culver's customer. I went through the drive thru, & ordered a Double bacon burger combo. The guy at the window was nice, and I only waited about 3 mins for my food. I got all the way back to work, ate the fries (so damn good) and popped open the burger box. The burger was good, but I was super irritated that I ordered AND paid for a double bacon burger but got a single burger with no bacon. When I tried to call about it, I was put on hold for 10mins, I ended up just hanging up. Not the best of experiences."}
{"text":"Burger was lacking in flavor. Fries were ok. I heard a lot of good things about the cheese curds, but I was not impressed. They tasted like mozzarella sticks you get @ Applebee's. Extremely greasy. 

The concrete mixer was the only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1. I would go back for the ice cream but ONLY the ice cream... but only if there wasn't a Dairy Queen around :)

Should be noted that I was impressed with the level of service from the staff. Wasn't expecting that from a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Not ashamed to say this is THEE best tasting burger and milkshake I've ever had.  =)

I had a bacon cheese butter burger or something like that, and their fried cheese curds...  PSSSSHHHH!!!  I was ALL about it!  Nice and heavy... stick to your ribs kind of cheese burger, just the way a cheeseburger SHOULD be.

I ordered (upon the advice of my roomie) the butter pecan milkshake...  the girl in the drive trhu said they didn't have that milkshake, so I just ordered their butterscotch milkshake instead.  However, when I got my order...  it was a butter pecan milkshake?  I don't know how or why this happened but I was happy it did.

I wasn't even MAD that they forgot our fries and cheese curds, of which i had to turn around and get....  mistakes happen and they rectified it.  EASY!

I will be going back VERY soon...  uhhh after my diet that is...  HAHAHA!"}
{"text":"It really disappoints me to say this but our food was not even remotely edible. My boyfriend and I are new to Phoenix and he's been hearing alot of commercials and advertising Culver's chicken which made us go in tonight. My boyfriend got a burger which he told me the onions tasted really funky, I had the Cod dinner, my fish literally had ZERO flavor, like it didnt even taste like fish it just felt like fish.... only texture no flavor. My side of potatoes..same thing, felt like potato tasted like nothing... Sucks to say but this place was a let down tonight.. oh well"}
{"text":"Food is over priced, but I come here for the concrete mixers anyway. Always expect to wait about 10 minutes even for the smallest order."}
{"text":"Didn't leave disappointed, but not thrilled either.  

Chopped steak was done really well, but the green bean side and mashed potatoes did not impress.  

Frozen custard, though, can hide many restaurant sins."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Arizona!!  'Nough said."}
{"text":"Fast food burgers aren't exactly known for their healthiness, but the burger I had here had to be the greasiest mess I've ever had. I ordered the sourdough melt, which I admit may be buttered a bit more than the normal burger. But I felt like I needed a shower after eating this. Decent flavor, but not good enough to warrant trying again.

Not a fan of the fries - I appreciate the fact that they do the crinkle-cut fries, to do something a bit different - but this just didn't work for me.

I've had the custard, and that was pretty good, probably qualifies as an alternative to DQ or BR if I'm in the mood for a quick frozen fix. But I don't think I'd be back for the burgers."}
{"text":"I have ate here more than a few times and let me tell you if I can quote the great Samuel L. Jackson \"This is one tasty burger\". They are called Butter burgers but its only the bun that has the butter on it but it does bring out the flavor for sure. The burger is what they do best here along with the custard. The onion rings are also a great side to pair with the burger, they are thick and delicious. If you are going here for something else such as fish, chicken or salad they do that here as well but not as good as the burgers. One of my favorites places to cool down in the summer heat. Come here and grab a bite."}
{"text":"Butter Burgers are good and I love the french fries."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and their ice cream blows DQ out of the water."}
{"text":"I know they are new so I will cut them some slack but......I have Celiacs and told the cashier when I placed my order. I requested a grilled chicken sandwich on a gluten free bun. I felt pretty secure when I saw a note at the top of my reciept that saw alleegy to gluten. So what do I get? A beautifully breaded chicken filet. They did get me a new patty but the rest of my party was done with their meal by the time it came. I will say the food there is delicious. But staff seems absolutely clueless about allergy and the young man who brought my food was baffled as to what to do about the breaded patty. I had to ask if they could remake it. Culvers seens concerned about customers with allergies and has an excellent brochure in regard to nutrition. I went there for that reason. After the excellent experience I had at Culvers on 1st Ave in Tucson I will blame this time on the store being new. I will go back."}
{"text":"Double deluxe butter burger with fried cheese curds. Excellent quality, flavor, and service. Make sure to upgrade to cheese curds for your side, the extra $1.30 is well worth it. The frozen custard is better than any other ice cream in town! The concrete mixers are also an amazing treat."}
{"text":"Ohhh man this place has the most delicious butter burgers you've ever had in your life I'm talking about calorie blasting heart vessel clogging butter burgers delicious I think I'm going to give me one right now!!"}
{"text":"Culver's of Cross Plains is the best! My favorite Culver's to visit. Very friendly staff and short wait times. They just had their 25th anniversary, so they had half price items. Great restaurant, and very well managed!"}

{"text":"I love culvers. I grew up eating it in the Midwest. However, I went to the one on Shea for the first time today. The burger I got was so undercooked I couldn't eat it (and that's coming from someone who eats steaks medium rare)."}
{"text":"So delicious.  The butter burger....WOW! and the Culver's house brewed Root Beer is the best I've ever had.  

Tip:  The fries kind of suck, so substitute for the cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Great environment, great staff, pretty good food but a little more expensive than their competitors. I like that they hand out a coupon for free ice cream with kids meals and they somehow are the only people on the planet that have figured out that kids burgers should be plain unless condiments are requested. I'll probably go back on occasion but won't make it a staple even though I live quite close"}
{"text":"My very first (and most likely last) experience at Culver's on Shea Blvd.  and the 101 drive through this evening was a waste of my money. 

Ordered a pacific codd sandwich and an order of cheese curds. Cheese curds were cold and I only got half a sandwich. Bottom bun, shredded lettuce and luckily fish. No tarter sauce, olives or the rest of the condiments, even the top of the bun was missing.

The only reason they are getting two stars instead of one is that my boyfriend liked his hamburger.

 Ordered a pint of chocolate custard, it's probably vanilla."}
{"text":"Like nearly every other national food chain, Culver's (predominately from Midwest) is loading up on locations in the Greater Phoenix Area. This is not a bad thing though. 

This particular location opened in early March, 2015, and is brand spanking new and sparkling clean. 

We went here for some post-baseball game custard and their custard sundaes with the pecans are really good. We also grabbed a pint of orange cream custard to take home from the mini fridge next to where you order. They had more than a dozen of different concrete pint flavors in there and they are only $3.50 each or 4/$9.99. 

The service was really good and a young lady even brought us a whole cup of extra pecans (free of charge) to add to the sundaes we were devouring at our table.

It's not as good as having Kopp's or Leon's in Milwaukee but you can't beat this when in the desert!"}
{"text":"6 of us here, eating everything in site. Burgers, Reuben, fries & salad was all great, no complaints. Service was wonderful, place was clean. My Reuben could've used a little more dressing but no biggy, they even brought out our stuff plus got us condiments. Will go back when I come back up."}
{"text":"When we drove to our hotel, Culver's was right next door to us. I was curious when I read their description: Butterburgers and frozen custard. I'd thought I would try the custard, since I have never had custard. You must forgive me, since I am So Cal, born and bred, and only know soft serve.

Since most of our meals were already planned out, we could only sneak in the custard in between the meals. When we were in line for Pizzeria Bianco, I had asked the second in line's opinion of Culver's and was told they were very good, albeit back in the mid West. They had tried it here, but said the franchises out here did not compare. They said the burgers were good and the custard was a must try.

I decided to forgo the daily flavor and went with the vanilla. It is simply the most divine thing ever! Imagine soft serve, with a silky and creamy texture. It literally blew my mind to how good this was. I was determined to have it a few more times and buy a few quarts to bring home with me. Can't beat this: quart #1 $5.50 + quart #2 3.00, so hells yes two quarts. I am saving them for a special occasion...

I will definitely try the burgers the next time I'm in town. Where else do they slap butter onto the patty?"}
{"text":"I think this Culver's location is really good.  The staff are really nice and helpful, more than other fast food restaurants and even other Culver's locations.  I have come here several times and have never had a problem with my order."}
{"text":"When the rootbeer float I ordered imploded all over my freshly washed/vaccumed car...the girls says \"yah that happens a lot when you put the straw in, do you want more napkins\" wtf!!!!! Uh seriously, I threw it away in front of her, she offered zero replacement, even tho 2/3 were on ground & car! Even though I had just spent $20 on sandwhiches. Zero help, except: do you want more napkins\" Idiot!!! I have never left a bad review anywhere until now. Disgusting customer service. I will never return to this location, even if these sandwhiches turn out to be tasty."}
{"text":"I love their shakes and fries! I can't wait to try other items on their menu. The atmosphere reminds me similar to Chick Fil A. They even brought our food to us. I heard the butter burger is amazing, I'll be trying that next. Stay tuned :)"}
{"text":"I expected much more from this place.  I had heard exciting tales of succulent burgers cooked in yummy butter, and while I could definitely taste the butter, the rest was bland and poorly balanced.

Fries were ok, but they felt like a cheap Del Taco knock-off.

Service?  If you like a snotty heavy-set woman getting short with you, then it's great.  Culver's needs to hire some better folks, especially if they're trying to get their foot in the door here in Arizona.  They need employees who can think.  I had a coupon for a buy one get one free Double Deluxe, and they wouldn't substitute a cheaper burger for the free one.  Logic doesn't fly here, apparently.

Oh, and whoever designed the parking lot is an idiot.  What a horrible, cramped design.  If you drive a big truck or SUV, good luck to you.

I won't go back."}
{"text":"Not a fan. The meat has no flavor. My sandwich was burnt. Pickle was dry. Fries taste frozen. This place recently opened. Everything is new but still a little dirty considering there were only a few customers. Not coming here anymore....ever!"}
{"text":"Apparently this is one of the places that you have the try in Wisconsin, and you have to try their custard. I ate here twice, because the prices were good and the food was made fresh. The first time I had a Reuben melt, which was very good. They brought the food out to me, and I sat around listening to kids trying to speak in ebonics with Wisconsin accents (flat oh's). the second time I had a chicken sandwhich, deep fried cheese curds and custard. All of which was very tasty!! 

If you are in the area and see a Culver's I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"This review is about the service, not the food. The food is usually good, but today we got the worst service ever. We ordered at the drive up window, and pulled around to the side to wait for our food. Several cars behind us in line came and left, so my husband went inside to ask about our order. They had no idea where it was. The employees inside had no idea that there was an order matching our number. Maybe someone gave our order to another customer. They asked my husband if he wanted to wait for them to make another meal. He requested his money back. But they didn't simply refund his money, he had to WAIT for his money as well, while the manager was going through the register looking for some record of his order. But in the mean time, she was waiting on other customers in the drive up window! There was still no record of our order, so she had to calculate the order over again from what he ordered. It took forever, and finally I decided to leave the car and see if my husband might have been abducted by aliens, but I did see him coming back to the car, no meal in hand. Usually in situations like this, some compensation is made to the customer, either a free meal or at least some coupons. Nothing here. Even though we did not get any food here, we left with a bad taste in our mouths. Next time I want to eat at Culvers, I'll head down the road to the one in Stoughton instead."}
{"text":"Culvers is really good stuff.

Menu-wise, you can compare it to Sonic, except EVERYTHING here is MUCH better!

I love the burgers, the sides, and anything at all made with their frozen custard.  
If you like cheese, DO NOT miss the cheese curds.

I'd give it 5 stars, but value factors into the equation and the bill at Culvers can really add up."}
{"text":"I heard some ad on TV a month or so ago and wanted to try it out. Glad we did. Much better than many other FF places. The burgers are great and wife's chicken strips fantastic, crunchy coating and juicy chicken inside.
My burger , a double with bacon, very tasty with all the right compliments. I will now search out these stores  in the future when near them  for lunch or dinner. Oh and the service was great too as the young people who brought the food out were outstanding in manners."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing (better than Freddy's) and the crinkle cut fries were hot and good.  Prices are comparable to Freddy's, and food came out fast.  Employees were pleasant.  Overall, good experience, and did I mention the burgers are really, really GOOD??  The dining room smells amazing b/c they are making waffle cones all the time.  We were too full to order dessert, but it looked delicious.  
I'll be back."}
{"text":"Update -

First trip was a fluke, bad sandwich. I would say steer clear of the patty melt. We have eaten here a few times since and it has been stellar. The custard is out of this world, the kids meals come with a free custard which is a nice touch. I still like the burgers at In N Out better, but I have definitely eaten here quite a bit more than I have there in the past couple of months so that may change."}
{"text":"They make possibly the best burger on the planet....nuff said!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good for fast food.  Although, if they have to cook your food it can take them a few minutes to get your order together.  And they always give you a number, whether to-go or dine-in.

The burgers and chicken are ok, not a lot of seasoning and you pretty much need to specify everything you want on the burger, otherwise you get a fairly plane burger.  The sides are exceptional, onion rings, cheese curds, and fries are all really great, fresh from the fryer.

The major issue with this particular Culver's is the service from the employees.  Once in a while you get a really good employee.  But, most of the time the employees seem fairly indifferent to customers, especially with the large array of options on the menu.  Fairly often, even when no one is in line they will become impatient with your ordering, especially if you aren't aware of your options.  I've also noticed a bad attitude from the managers when manning they take my order.

FYI, the custard is about on the level of soft serve ice cream, not sure why they charge so much for that."}
{"text":"Good burger, kinda greasy.. Decent customer service, foods kinda pricey. Good place to go after church, walls are littered with bible quotes. Considering the amount of butter in the burgers I'd consider visiting only once in a while. Don't get me started on them cheese curds."}
{"text":"This is the first time my family has ever been to Culver's and am happy to say it won't be the last. 

My husband and I had a date night out on a Friday night and we were tired and just wanted to grab something quick to eat and have been eyeing this place since it opened up. 

Showing up around 11pm ( I believe) and was happy to pull up to a BIG BRIGHT MENU..... 

We mulled it over and I grabbed a Mushroom Swiss Burger and my hubby grabbed the shaved prime rib sandwich. 

The burger was awesome! Not that it was fancy in the least but it was how you would want your burger to taste. 
Big fat patty, seasoned and cooked right. I enjoyed every bite and it wasn't too greasy. 
Their fries I could have done without, there was just nothing to them.

My husband bragged about his sandwhich too says it tasted great. 

The staff was super friendly too!

Next time I want fast food I will come to Culvers.."}
{"text":"I dabbled between three and four stars on this one, but had to go with three. 

My boyfriend and I decided to go here for ice cream on one of the gruesome 115 degree Arizona afternoons that we Scottsdale natives know to be so draining. After seeing countless Culver's commercials about their signature concrete mixers, ice cream sundaes and several other frozen treats, we decided to go here instead of venturing down Shea to the local Dairy Queen. 

Now. I was a little taken back, because I never knew Culver's was a walk-up-and-order fast food kind of joint. Silly me, I thought it was an actual place where you sit down to get burgers and ice cream. But hey. I was wrong. Nothing wrong with that. So we ventured in, ordered, and then found a seat in the dining area (that looks somewhat similar to the inside of the local Wildflower Bread Co.-- decorated with hand-blown glass flowers fake plants and whatnot). 

The one thing that kind of rubbed me the wrong way about this restaurant was that the dining area was completely silent. There were about five other seated parties and with no ambient music or noise from the muted television screens that hang above, it makes the atmosphere a little weird. Everyone, including us, felt obligated to have whispering conversations so that it didn't disturb the silence. It was so quiet that I could almost hear the couple in the booth behind us licking the ice cream off their spoons. 

Anyhow, we ordered two concrete mixers. Mine: vanilla custard with brownie chunks and snickers and his: chocolate custard with hot fudge and some other chocolate add in. (Each mixer comes with two mix-ins, each additional one after that is .50c) They were both REALLY good. Not the best I've ever eaten, but they definitely beat a Blizzard that you would get from DQ. The custard was smooth in texture, and had a really nice and pure flavor. The employees add a bunch of your mix-ins and are far from skimpy. For the custard to mix-in ratio I'd say about 1/4 of your dessert is mix-ins (which is a great ratio in my opinion). For the two 'short' mixers and a medium drink it was around $10, which really wasn't bad. 

The employees were helpful and seemed knowledgeable on their products. Would have been a four star if the ambiance was a little better and a lot less awkward. Quality custard, though!"}
{"text":"I was in Verona on business and saw a sign that read \"Butter burgers\" and instantly knew that I would be trying this place out. I have never heard of Culvers or butter burgers, but i KNOW now. The burger is pretty good. It was crispy and moist at the same time.The Fried cheese curds weren't all that. The custard was amazing. They let you sample before you buy which was pretty cool. All in all I would go again"}
{"text":"I love the French fries at this place. Good burger made the way you want them. Higher expenses do I don't visit them regularly."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good spot for a fast food burger. The cheese curds are salty, fried, cheesy deliciousness. I haven't been impressed with any of their sandwiches or the fries. The price is a little high for fast food, but it does taste like better quality than the usual fast food suspects: McD's, Arby's, Hardee's. Drive thru service is incredibly slow as everything is supposedly cooked to order. The custard is really good and I love that kids' meals come with a free sundae, any flavor."}
{"text":"Ordered burger with no pickles and no tomatoes. Sure enough I get home and there's pickles and tomatoes. This place is was too overpriced for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":".:chomp:. this is one .:mmmghgh:. good burger .:sllluuuurrrpp:.
It's got a great combination of yumminess with a side of .:chomp:. awesomeness. The burgers are great and .:chomp:. perfect. 

The custard is great .:lick:. and diabetic friendly .:mmmmmmm:.(They have no sugar added custard). i would definitely recommend this place! .:lick:."}
{"text":"Have never been to a Culver's but I know it's a national chain and I've seen them in Illinois and Wisconsin before. In any case, decided to give them a try today.

Walked in and was immediately impressed with the size of the menu board. Very extensive with  something for everyone.  

After some thought, I went with the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Fries on the side and a fountain drink.  You place your order and pay and they give you a little number to put on your table.  You get your own drink and take a seat and shortly your meal will be delivered to you.

Service was fast and friendly and I was impressed by the finger wipes they brought with my lunch. Nice touch.

The Pork Tenderloin unfortunately did not measure up.  A bit overcooked and with a greasy taste did not cut it. Fries on the other hand were very good.

Restaurant is very clean and well organized and apparently well managed.

Next time I'll try something a little different and maybe I can find something a bit more appealing."}
{"text":"This review is solely for Boston Cream.

This is my favorite flavor at other establishments. I really like the donut, the pie, just everything. However, this flavor? Total let down. It was too sweet and did not have a good cream flavor. Making cream flavored ice cream and adding chocolate does not make it Boston Cream. The effort was there but the execution was sad."}
{"text":"I love this fast food restaurant.  Their burgers are always good and taste fresher than most fast food joints.  Their fries and cheese curds are also quite tasty.  The absolute best thing here though is their concrete mixers.  They are so delicious!"}
{"text":"Just left Culver's after waiting behind 2 cars.  Handed  the cashier my money and then another employee came to the window and said they couldn't accept the $5 bill, because it was written on. Took the money and left.  Sonic accepted the same $5 for my drink that Culver's didn't. Won't be going back and will discourage anyone I know from going, since apparently Culver's only accepts clean new bills. Food not so great either, but now I have another reason to stay away for good. BTW, US currency is not void simply because it has been written on in some fashion. Bad call by this Culver's store at 99th Ave and Camelback in Glendale Az."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Plus you are made to move even when no other cars are in line.  10 minutes for a combo? ??"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I always order their mushroom double Swiss burger basket & it's always hot & juicy. This trip I decided to order a 6 piece jumbo shrimp along with my usual & it was yummy. I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Burger aficionado? You owe it to yourself to check this place out. The burgers are juicy, tender and loaded with flavor. If you're in the neighborhood don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I have a love/lust affair with a place that puts butter in meat, and serves different flavors of custard every day. Once went vegan for a horrifying 10 weeks -- don't do that -- and drove here to break the streak. 

My only complaint is this takes longer than most other Culver's. I know it's not fast food, but I find myself driving by because I don't have easy access heading West, and don't want to spend 15 minutes waiting. Going inside does not speed it up -- tested many times."}
{"text":"PFG for a lunch time burger.  I had the double with cheese and bacon with some slaw on the side.  Filled me up and gave me a greasy feeling all afternoon, but while eating it, I have to say it was really tasty.  Don't come here expecting to find burger nirvana.  Even writing this feels like I'm doing a review on a McDonalds or a Jack in the Box, but being from Hawaii and having never tried a Culver's butter burger before I'll give myself a pass this once.  Basically it's a fast food place that kicks it's burgers up a notch by adding butter.  If Mickey d's did this, they might have a law suit on their hands.  But I say as long as it's legal, the butter burger plays. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch at Culver's.  Having eaten at other Culver locations several times, I knew what to order - a single, deluxe burger.  This time I tried a chocolate shake that had great flavor, but it was a bit too thick for me to drink through the straw.  Next time I'll stick with having my Culver's ice cream as a dessert.

This location is very, very popular and I recommend entering from the Ikea side of the parking lot so as not to be blocked by the long line of cars at the drive through window."}
{"text":"I like their custard, though I'd much rather go to Jarling's for that. The hot food isn't great, and isn't terrible. What it is is overpriced. That said, that's not what keeps me from coming back. What does is the policy of giving you your ice cream, THEN having you pull forward and wait for hot food. By the time I'm home, the ice cream is melted every time. Very inefficient. If I do go, I only go for the ice cream during the winter when Jarling's is closed."}
{"text":"Good thing I really like the ice cream or I would have gone hungry yesterday after picking up a late lunch. I get home and open my bag of food- burger and fries- and there is this weird stench. The meat was the culprit! It was so bad I couldn't eat it. I tried a tiny bite trying to give them the benefit of a doubt. That was a bad choice! oh boy was it nasty! Tasted as bad as it smelled. If I go back it is because of the ice cream."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes, Culver's definitely has THE best customer service hands down! Burgers are good and my kids love the custards!"}
{"text":"This place is new to the street but not new to az! My sister worked at culvers for the past 3 years in chandler and so I've been there a few times. I know for sure that the food is supposed to be made AFTER you place the order. My food came out super quick and was cold. After spending $10 on a fast food meal ( which is a lot to me for a burger cheese curds and a soda) it was cold! And the burger had so much grease it was dripping off of the burger, it was so well done that it was burnt and it had no flavor. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The Best Fast Food Burger  joint in the area....love their homemade taste! They have a great menu and the kids always  find something  that  they like.  They are  fast and convenient . .."}
{"text":"The worst place I've ever ate the manager be Littles the employees why you're trying to eat thank God there's an in and out burger right across the street"}
{"text":"Amazing! They're so fast, great customer service and their custard is amazing. Everything they have is so tasty and delicious. I'm never disappointed in any way! The service is great and right next to the highway so it's convenient!"}
{"text":"I wanted ice cream so my husband pulled off the highway at this Culver's. We opted to get the flavor of the day (cookie dough craving). I was disappointed to find that it was a chocolate custard with TONS of cookie dough chunks because I like custard and not just the mix-ins, etc. but it was overall a decent sundae. I'll just stick to vanilla next time!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early lunch on my way to Springfield the other day; it's close to Sam's where I get my gas when in the CU area.  Anywho, it's Culver's.  The snack pack is a deal for lunch; under $4.  This place lost a star because the bathroom floor was so sticky I kinda felt like a mouse must feel on one of those glue traps....pretty gross.  Clean up the bathrooms and you can have another star."}
{"text":"Took my wife here because she's from Wisconsin and it's hard to find these around the south. The butter burger and onion rings were good. I really like the custard! It's very creamy and the texture is smooth. Probably the best soft serve ever. The deep fried cheese curds are wonderful. If you really want a fast food experience that is different check out this restaurant."}
{"text":"OMG!!  Ordered a BACON cheeseburger, got a cheeseburger... took it up to counter.  \" you want a side of bacon??\"  WTF?!?!   I want whaat I ordered the first time.  Oh apparently some people want the bacon on the side?? Hmmmm.  Getting refund and going somewhere else!  Not sure if I'll ever come back.  Las t two trips here haven't been that great."}
{"text":"First time at this one. Ordered a raspberry bacon salad with chicken. They forgot the bacon! Went to the counter and ask the young lady why no bacon the answer was I don't know. They were really nice the gave me a side 5 very tiny chips on the side after I eat my salad. Ask to speak to the manage and got this very nice team leader that did nothing to resolve the problem. Maybe this is a steep stone in life are just really poorly trained. Not a good experience at Culver's just makes you question visiting another one. Just seems really immature."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken and fish for first time. I prefer their burgers but the other sandwiches were not bad. Fish was fresh but can be a bit messy, just grab a fork. I went through drive thru this time and on one of az's 120 degree days this weekend was brought my soda and I watched it melt while waiting 5+min for food. I ended having to walk back in to get a new drink and sauces for onion rings that wasn't given."}
{"text":"This was my first time here from California.    Amazing food and the best workers you could ask for.  Very happy place to be and is a place I would come back too.  Come to California we need you ....."}
{"text":"My sis and I went in, once before and great food decent price and excellent, So we decided to go back for lunch, on 4.23.26 after 4pm , the older guy behind the register stared right at us, with out acknowledging that we were waiting for service, he kinda stared thru us, as he was talking to the cook in the back, in a few minutes a lady, stepped up and asked , What would you like to order, nothing like thanks for waiting , welcome, hi there, I will take your order, she came across like she was super busy, my sister order and paid, then I stepped up to order and she looked at me, at the same time an order came up from the cook, she goes, Oh I will take this to the customer, and walks away as I am about to order, I was like wow! the kid that works the drive thru saw she did this and stepped tight up and took my order, I think his name is Lucen or something with an L, 
Orders place, we sat down, food was brought to us, and we began eating, everything looked good and tasted amazing, then came the old guy vacumning the dinning room, we were the onlu customers there, and we couldnt hear ourselves, he stood right next to us vacumning, Who does right next to where the customers are eating, I asked him to stop and he stopped not before fuming that he had to get this done,
We ate in silence, that kinda ruined it for us, after our meal, we decided to dessert, again the little lady was quite abrupt and rude as she took our order
We didnt feel comfortable, or welcomed.
I had a distinct feeling that these two older people that waited on us were Racist,... and we will not return to this establishment

{"text":"OMG. HELL-the-f*ck-O!

Culver's,
I sure am glad you came to the valley. I read about you in the paper. Guess what? I want to eat you!!!

So, I unfortunately have not eaten any real food here yet. But I'm sure planning on coming back for some!

I saw the sign about their strawberry mango smoothies. There is a reason these puppies come with a spoon. I don't care how good you are ladies, there is almost no way in hell you're gonna suck hard enough to get at it. They start out THAT thick! They have real fruit chunks in them too. But not too chunky. It's pretty blended, but you can tell actual fruit went in. It was a little too sweet at times but still ridiculously tasty. I think I liked the mango bit more than the strawberry."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Culvers, but this location is not as awesome as the ones in Minneapolis and Wisconsin.  However, good service nonetheless, excellent burgers and mmm Culvers frozen custard.  It just can't be beat."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

Not only does it feel welcoming, but the food is fresh. It reminds me of Braums in Oklahoma.

The frenchfries are fresh and great. When you bite into a burger it just feels right. I enjoy how great their customer service is. You go inside it's clean and sanitary. 

The drive in sometimes takes a while but because the fresh burgers and fries I'm okay with it. I love how in  the drive in they will explain what's all in something and they are promptly on knowing the menus. They greet wheb drive up and also I love to ask what their favorite malt is so I can try."}
{"text":"Not only was my pub burger awesome, and soup just hit the spot, but best part about this place are the people who work here. They were friendly, helpful, and welcoming.  We very much enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"This was the worst fast food meal I have had in 50 years. The grilled chicken sandwich was barely warm, very dry, and no mayo. I believe the chicken, which did not appear \"grilled\" by the way, had been re-heated several times, and had not been cooked fresh to order. Tasteless, dry, and one side had leathery surface I could not bite through.  The fries were barely warm and were very dry, as if they had been sitting in the container a long time. Certainly not fresh from the fryer. My wife had salad with chicken which was also very dry. I am a Culver's fan because of the hot, freshly fried burgers, but I will be going to McDonald's across the street from this Culver's from now on. Their grilled chicken and fries are at least 3 times better."}
{"text":"The only thing bad I have to say about this place is that it is a bit pricey if you're not alone. Other than that the food is tasty, service is excellent, and it is hands down the best place to do a fundraiser. I love supporting my local teams and schools by eating here. They always have some sort of promotion going on. Its casual, but still nice. Its kept very clean. The menu has a nice selection and the food is always served hot. If you're looking for something fast that is more upscale than McDonald's, go here."}
{"text":"went here the other day and got the colby jack pub burger, it was really good. and the onion rings were also very yummy. i will defiantly go back sometime to try some of their other items."}
{"text":"Being a midwestern girl, I was super psyched when I saw Culver's locations popping up around the valley. However, this location (which is the closest to me) is full of disappointments. Every single time I have been through the drive-thru, I end up having to wait to the side for at least 7-10 minutes, and then they get my order wrong on top of that. Going inside is less of a pain but still inconsistent with accuracy and efficiency. At least the custard never fails!"}
{"text":"Great Culver's location with friendly and gracious staff and, most importantly, delicious custard! Service and quality of food are reliable. Also offers tv's that usually show live sporting events or children's programming. Easier to access this location now since the city put a traffic light at 8th Place and Camelback. Can get a little noisy when big groups are present."}
{"text":"We love their custard. I love getting the chocolate custard with a cone and my husband gets the peanut butter concrete mixers. They pile on the toppings which I love. They are always helpful and love they have so many high chairs plus booster seats. Kid friendly."}
{"text":"This is the nicest Culver's I've ever been to, which is ironic considering I'm from Wisconsin and have been to multiple Culver's in the state."}
{"text":"Had the grilled chicken sandwich--was grilled well, hot, with a crispy toasted bun. I wish there'd been more innate flavoring without reliance on condiments, but the sandwich was satisfactory. My small fries were under-salted to my liking but hot and crispy regardless. My chicken fingers were too well done to be enjoyable, and bland with the batter used--wouldn't order again. My corn dog was pretty great and had great sweet breading--I will be repurchasing that. 
Good not great and note-worthy experience, and little too overpriced for my overall experience in my opinion."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We need one in Winston Salem, NC
Butter Burger and Vanilla Custard with Peaches....so tasty."}
{"text":"Butter burger!! The fries are the only thing holding this place back. Onion rings are the way to go. I don't venture out on the whole menu."}
{"text":"Had a chocolate concrete mixer with snickers and heath and it was delicious. It was a short wait and everyone was really nice.  

My friend had the same but with vanilla and said he loved it!

We will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Only fast food burger I eat in Tempe, the Custard is terrific and each weekend I find an excuse to use a coupon and grab two Milk Shakes, Sundays, or Mixers. The burgers and fries are great for a fast food restaurant. The staff is friendly and when I drive through with my dog they always have a dog treat for him."}
{"text":"I need to give Culver's a high five. I normally don't go to Culver's for lunch since it is crazy busy and packed with the Honeywell and Cox crowd. But today I braved the crowds and must've had that \"get out of my way IDGAF look since I didn't have my breakfast today vibe\" since I zoomed to the front of the line and ordered right away and even found an empty table. 

I was in need of a fix and had a delicious and juicy double cheeseburger with all of the fixings. The cheese was actually melted on the burger, did you hear that Mc Donalds and Burger King? 

Culver's is more than a burger place. I also really enjoy their hot ham and swiss cheese sandwich (think grilled cheese but add the ham). Occasionally I'll eat the fried fish as well. My wife swears by the Turkey BLT sandwich. If you have a couple of bucks left over, try the ice cream sundae or any other of their dessert concoctions. 

Services is always spot on. So I think the menu is diverse enough to satisfy everyone in the family, plus it's very easy on the pocketbook."}
{"text":"The place was great.  The burgers were juicy and flavorful.  The butter bun was similar to a Brioche bun and just as soft.  

They have many options for side dishes and cheese curds were interesting.  I still prefer the curds without any breading or deep frying, but they were still good.

The custard was outstanding.  It was creamy and full of flavor.  The concretes end up being better than a DQ Blizzard since the custard is better than the DQ ice cream.

Based on the many different options, this is a place that could give In and Out a run for its money in California.  It beats 5 Guys easily."}
{"text":"best cheese curds and custard ever. Anything with strawberry is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was not disappointed. The burger was absolutely delicious. It truly melted in my mouth. The service was great. I will definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great service that results in a butter burger, cheese curds and root beer.   This place is clean and the service was quick.   Not sure about the comments below.   The food was fresh and hot.   Always end the meal with a custard......ahh the flavor of the day!      It is considered fast food....but it is far better than the fast food competition that is out there."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.   Fresh burgers and the cheese curds are melt in your mouth perfect.   The service is way above average and the restaurant is very clean.   I have enjoyed Culvers for years when we would visit on vacation.   Now we live here and we make a weekly visit to Culvers for dinner.   Of course you have to top the meal off with a custard.   It is a fast food restaurant but it is way above what you would expect from a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"First time at a Culver's after I had heard good things from multiple people. Overall, not really too impressed. I should have checked yelp and read all the great reviews about the custard as I probably would  have stuck with that.

First, pretty slow for fast food. You order, pay and then pull up into a parking/waiting spot until your food comes out. Not a big issue and I guess everything is cooked to order.

My main issue was the food. I had a bacon burger with cheese. Side of fries and a soda.  Pretty standard fast food meal. When I got home I pretty much had a greasy bag.  The burger was super greasy, somewhat flavorful, and kinda boring. I guess the extra grease is the added butter? I don't get it. I'm not the healthiest eater but I felt like this should have come with a side of Lipitor. 

The fries were good. I would go back for the fries.

Next time I'm just going to get custard."}
{"text":"Maybe I've never owned a pickup truck or slept with my sister but i don't get this place just the same.  I might as well see stellar reviews for burger king or Wendys.  This place is fast food, processed, greasy, nothing special.  In n out it gourmet to this like a burger from roaring fork compared to mcdonalds, not to mention crazy over priced I guess to pay for their fancy sign.  Keeping it real there are so many good burger places and I'm glad fat people with no taste go here to save the good ones for me.  This being said I went because I work close and was dragged to for lunch.  I had the processed chicken sandwich and a bite of the butter burger.  Honestly should have got a happy meal from McDonald's plus would of scored a toy, that's like a free star."}
{"text":"Their cod sandwich is quite good a big portion and fast service.  The drink selection is limited but the place is neat and clean."}
{"text":"The way my Dad talked about this place I seriously expected them to give you free lapdances with each meal. He serviced them and said their kitchen was one of the cleanest fast food kitchens he'd ever seen and then went on to blab for hours about how their food couldn't compare to anything else and they were going to change the way Arizona sees fast food.

We came here as a family for dinner. The place was REALLY crowded and the line long. It's kind of hard to order because they make everything made to order (which is good I mean...yum fresh!) but that means you have to explain what you want in detail on every burger. When you're ordering for a family of five, that makes it kind of complicated. I thought their prices were a little high too but my dad insisted it was worth it. 

The burgers were really good. I was a big fan. The fries were whatever, but my dad ordered fried cheese curds and those were really tasty. Everything came out pretty quick but we discovered that we had been charged for an extra meal. So we ended up taking home a meal we didn't order because the line was so long we didn't want to complain about it. My family ordered frozen custard but I'm lactose intolerant so I held out. They said it was great though.

I'd definitely come back here but not with my entire family. The ordering situation was just too intense and messy for me. If they're going to be as busy as they are, they should really have a better system."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place for a great $5-$6 burger.  Try their \"Pub Burger\" whenever they offer it (seasonal burger) - I think it is Culver's best burger ever!  My kids can't get enough of it.  If they don't have the Pub Burger, then go for the \"Triple Cheese\" burger with double meat patties!  It will satisfy any cheese burger craving.

These 2 burgers at Culvers make it my favorite mid-priced burger joint at $5-6.  My other favorites are In'N-Out Burger at the cheap end of the spectrum for a $3.5 double meat burger, and Bobby Q's at the high end of the spectrum with the \"Perfect\" burger ($11 lunch special, or $15 on the dinner menu)."}
{"text":"My husband has a serious infatuation with custard ice cream. He is also is a fan of Culver's and luckily, we found one not too far away from where my Mom is currently living on the East Side of town.

We came here after seeing a movie and he ordered a small strawberry sundae. We had no idea they were running a special $2.00 for this and he ordered, we left and whilst he was devouring his treat in the backseat, we heard not a peep out of him. He declared it was his favorite and he should have gotten 10 scoops!

I was happy he was happy and like the other Culver's, the food isn't of interest to me (he likes the fried cheese curds too), I was glad he got his ice cream fix."}
{"text":"Custard style ice cream? I am now completely spoiled and no trip to DQ will cut it. The husband keeps telling me we need to have some of their ice cream shipped up here-I keep explaining that it won't happen. 

The food is take it or leave it IMO, but even I was a fan of the bits of ice cream I had on my two visits here and definitely a super fan of their banana milkshake which could indeed bring all the boys to the yard. Damn right."}
{"text":"Awful! This is basically DQ on steroids.
I asked the counter server about a few items which he had no idea about anything.
Wife ordered chicken strip dinner $9 and it was essentially frozen Tyson chicken out of a bag, gross!!!! Fries were cold and soggy.
I just got chili $4 for a little container and it was basically Wendy's. For $13 fast foot for 2 little items and crap food, it's a joke.
Oddly, we looked around the place and noticed most diners were a bit obese, think it must be a place for mid westerners. 
Won't ever be back, would rather go to habit burger or in-n-out or even McDonald's for that matter. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Good food... Friendly staff.  Frozen custard was the bomb"}
{"text":"Food was hot, cheese curds were on point and I loved the sweet potato fries! Hopefully they keep them because you just can't find sweet potato fries through drive through! Over all a good meal! Had the double bacon cheese burger as well and was very filling! Only didn't give 5 stars because the drive through window lady was kinds of rude!"}
{"text":"Butter burgers and custard. 
Order at the counter, and they give you a number and bring your food out when it's ready. This means a little bit of a wait if it's busy. But the food is always hot and fresh. I prefer the mushroom & Swiss double, with a custard to go afterwards. 
Custard flavors are vanilla, chocolate, and a rotating flavor of the day. Available as shakes, Concretion mixers ( think DQ Blizzard) or sundaes also. 
One of the best Midwest burger chains expands south."}
{"text":"This place on two separate visits, months apart, had forgotten my order and somehow lost it after waiting over 20 to 25 minutes each time. Employees rather text on their phones and lean against counters rather than serve their customers.

Culver's has awesome frozen custard with creative flavors of the day. This location also is very clean and well maintained especially the bathrooms which are a plus. You just have to make sure to check in with the front every 5 minutes if you don't want them to forget your order."}
{"text":"Wow...I just went thru the drive thru, approx 9:30PM tonight, and ordered a \"mocha shake\". First the guy said \"we can't do that\". I said 'what? why not?\". \"Management has told us we CAN'T make them any more\". \"What?\" \"We're not ALLOWED to make them any more\". I said, well I won't be doing business with you anymore, and drove on thru. WTF??? I know Midwesterners don't like coffee ice cream, and barely know what mocha IS, but this is ridiculous. You can't take some coffee ice cream (which you USED to have) and some chocolate syrup and MIX THEM??? I WILL NOT BE BACK."}
{"text":"I love Culver's.  Their burgers are among my favorite, the cheese curds are delicious, and their peanut butter Concrete Mixer is sinful.  Unfortunately, service at this location is exceptionally lacking.  I placed a drive-thru order for the food items mentioned above last week during the lunch hour.  I was asked to pull forward to wait for my meal, and I waited... and waited... and waited.  I waited for a full 20 minutes before my meal was brought out to me, only to find it was incorrect.  The server who brought the food out to me stared at me like he didn't know what I was saying and then told me I was mistaken.  When he saw I was, indeed, correct, he took my food bank in and I waited another five minutes for my meal.  At that point, already late getting back to work, I left.  Imagine my dismay when I got back to my desk and discovered my meal was wrong yet again.  It was my fault for not checking once again before leaving, I know, but seriously?  I'll stick with the Metrocenter location despite it being a few miles out of my way."}
{"text":"Love our local Culver's.  Staff at drive up is always pleasant.  Food is consistent.  Price point is perfect for the menu and food preparation offered."}
{"text":"frozen custard. all that needs to be said. super yummy and refreshing on a hot Arizona day. many flavors as well. that's not all they're known for. the butter burgers are pretty tasty as well as the fries. quick drive thru times and there are always plenty of people eating there any given time. that says plenty in itself. frozen custard is a must have."}
{"text":"I decided to give Culver's a second chance and I'm glad I did. The service is very friendly and the chipotle cheese curds I ordered were pretty good. I was surprised how spicy they were! I've also come back for the frozen custard I can't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"The food is super good!!! Love the Better Cheddar Burger with bacon and their root beer floats are out of this world!!! The customer service inside or drive thru is always awesome.  Very courteous!!! I was very please when I stopped while I was out Christmas shopping and stopped for a grilled cheese.  I did the basket and then asked for them to add a gift card.  They told me I could get the basket free because I was buying a gift card!!! whoo hoo!!!  LOVE CULVERS!!!!  The prices are reasonable and their concrete mixers are soooo good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a grilled chicken sandwich in the take line. The girl said it comes with lettuce,  pickle and tomato. I asked for Mayo and onikn to be added. The first thing wrong is the order had the wrong ticket number or I was given the wrong number for my car. When 'my turn' came up, the yoing man walked right past me, around the building.  He came back after about a minute. I asked him if it was my chicken sandwich.  He showed me that the receipt # was for #8. I had 21 on my car. The ticket said Mayo and Onion. I took the sandwich and went on my way. Fortunately,  I opened the sandwich up,  surprised to find only mayo on one bun and a slice of onion. I turned around and went into the store and adked for the manager. She proceded to tell me that it was not 'my' sandwich as the numbers didn't match. I said there were two vehicles behind me. Everyone cleared out ahead of me. She insisted it wasn't my order! I asked for a refund. I told her they need to learn how to resd the tickets. She said they know how to read the tickets. I responded,  well obviously not, as they didn't make this sandwich right. Disagreeing with me after screwing up one sandwich doesn't mske me a happy camper. I will not darken the doors of this store again."}
{"text":"We entered yesterday and had reubens, fries and soda.  Tasty, priced right and left me thinking about how much I wanted to return for another reuben again.

I see a lot of reviews about butterburgers and things I didn't try, unfortunately all I can comment is the Reuben that I had on my first visit (ever) and it was great."}
{"text":"Thought it would be neat to try this place out. Only lived in the area for a short time, but always seen this place very busy. I had a double burger with jalapenos, chipotle sauce and spicy cheese. They called it the triple hot? Something like that? It wasn't to bad, had a decent taste, and a good kick. Daughter had a regular cheese burger and chili cheese fries. Fries were decent and chili was good. Overall we had a good experience, it's not great but it's good. Since we are near by now, I am pretty sure we will eat here again."}
{"text":"Is it possible to cheat on your girlfriend with a burger? Every time I come here I get a bacon double butter burger. And its one of the best burgers I've ever had. Once I take that first bite I never put it down until the last. I keep it so close to my face it probably looks like im making out with it. And when im done I feel satisfied, yet guilty lol."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, we weren't very impressed. 
Busey Saturday, around 12:30, fairly long line, one order taker working. I will say they appeared to be slammed on the drive thru. 
We waited, thinking must be pretty good. Wife and I each had fish sandwiches. The fish itself was pretty good. The sandwich not so good. Crappy tasteless bread. We both agreed, been there tried it, won't go back. As we left the parking lot, my wife, who hates McDonald's, says \"I think a McFish might be a better sandwich.\" 
Other items might be a better way to go."}
{"text":"The burger was good. But I don't think it's worth 9 bucks. It's a small bun and the burger was very greasy. You'd get more bang for your buck at whataburger down the street."}
{"text":"We love culvers! Great food, great environment! The honey mustard and root beer are amazing!!"}
{"text":"this place is so good! If you are in the mood for a grate juicy burger  and awesome onion rings , fries , shacks . This is the place to be ."}
{"text":"For fast food drive-through place I have to say it's pretty darn good had a Reuben and it didn't have that sweet nasty thousand Island dressing on it very flavorful. Also had their hand breaded fish sandwich tasted very fresh and yummy nice crunch"}
{"text":"Good, quick meal. Girl at counter made suggestions for combo for best price. You order at counter, get number and food is brought to you. Good onion rings, a little on the salty side. Husband enjoyed fish sandwich. I had a cheeseburger single. It was Sunday and gospel music was playing. First time there so I don't know if that's the normal soundtrack or just special for Sunday."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite Culver's but the food is always fresh, prices do seem a bit higher than other Culver's. They offer breakfast at this location, I have yet to try it. Service always seems efficient with only a few times where things took longer than they should have."}
{"text":"Most of the staff here is super friendly. Some just don't seem to care if they work or not. 
The flavor of the food is in line with standard Culver's, but for some reason every time I eat there I have very uncomfortable issues within an hour or two of the meal. I've tried several different menu items to see what might be the cause with the only common item being the soda fountain. I've asked if they pull the taps off it and wash them each night but never get a solid answer from some of the staff. I will admit I've not brought it up to a manager. I'm normally in a rush to eat and get back to work. None of my coworkers have had similar issues."}
{"text":"It has been years since I have been to a Culvers and this was my first visit to this new store. Super clean, friendly speedy service, your choice of booths or table and chairs, and some covered outdoor seating as well. They were playing Louis Armstrong blues and jazz in the background. Parking is close to the door and plentiful.

I had the sourdough melt ($3.69) and a chocolate malt ($3.09). The malt was delicious and thick. The sourdough melt was tasty with sharp Wisconsin cheddar cheese and a burger that was juicy in the middle and crispy on the edges. The sourdough bread was perfectly toasted and held up to the ingredients.

Would I go back here? You bet!"}
{"text":"The fresh frozen custard chocolate shakes are terrific. The butterburgers are very good. The drive through is quick and the eat-in space is roomy and clean. Parking is easy. The prices are competitive with other fast food places."}
{"text":"This place is always clean and has a super friendly staff. The food is cooked to order and have yet to get an incorrect order. Which seems to be a rarity in most fast food places. The interior is well laid out with tv's to watch your fav sporting or children's programming. The line gets quite long for drive through so being your patience in the drive through. Be sure to try the plethora of ice cream flavors !! Most made fresh!! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here a while ago, did not see what the big deal was with the burger, mine seemed overcooked and had a weird crust on it. the place was kind of dumpy and I don't see the point of the religious signs everywhere.

If there was butter on the burger I would not have known."}
{"text":"I give Culvers three stars because it was neat, clean and  the staff was friendly. However my order was wrong. I ordered a meatless salad but when it arrived, it had chicken. I must admit, the chicken was well-prepared and tasty.  However, I do think it was odd that they came out with the dessert about 10 minutes before the entrée. Regardless, the free Wi-Fi was appreciated!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food, and clean atmosphere!

First time visiting a Culver's so I had to order the original butter burger, it was freaking delicious! The fries were a bit undercooked, but they were still good. All around I would visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've been here. There are lots of selections to choose from, burgers, chicken to fish and ice cream! Their onion rings are ok."}
{"text":"Food is ALWAYS fantastic, Service is ALWAYS on point - the employees are super happy and you can tell they enjoy their work.  Daily custard, yumm-o!"}
{"text":"Culvers always has great food but there needs to be a serious improvement with the service soon.  Almost every time I go I receive my order wrong and they have a really bad problem about giving you shakes/malts right away and then you have to wait 10 minutes for the rest of your order in the drive through. Frozen stuff comes out last in the drive through. That's Fast Food 101 and should be addressed immediately."}
{"text":"Managers are RACIST!!! Heard lots of racist comments here last Thursday... Making fun of one of their employee about his skin color and his nationality!!! They made soooo much FUN of him that he had to quit!!! Food might be good but I rather go somewhere where there's Equal Opportunity Employer! I hope they get reported to BBB."}
{"text":"Wow, extensive menu.  Love that there is chicken, burgers and fish to choose from but especially like the kids menu where grilled cheese and corn dog is an option.  Plus love that the kids get a scoop of custard.  Definitely worth a little bit more than other places due to the options.  My daughter got the tenders which was both a chicken and a fish piece for $5.89 + fries, drink and a scoopie.  My son had the grilled cheese and I had the cod sandwich.  I think I was so hungry that I wanted another fish sandwich, but it was tasty and nicely portioned for the price.  I liked the cleanliness and it felt like a dining room with the carpet and the tv."}
{"text":"One of the few things that I can talk my wife into eating in the way of \"fast food\" is Culver's meals. I care for her in a home hospice setting and I never hesitate to make a Culver's run for a burger or in today's case, a fish sandwich. It if was a meal for myself I probably wouldn't even bother with these comments, but considering the circumstances I just wanted to communicate a serious case of disappointment. I ordered two cod sandwiches with tarter on the side. Sandwich was prepared correctly but when I arrived home ... not a sign of tarter sauce! (Strike One). Personally, I really enjoy the cheese curds too so I ordered some for myself. Imagine my continued surprise when I dug down in the bag to discover that Onion Rings were the substitute of the day! (Strike Two). Wow folks - I'm glad the order was relatively simple. So there you go. Next time I guess I'll have to drive a little further to the next closest location. Sooooooo not pleased!
From Culver's:
THANKS FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.
Culver's is committed to the idea that every guest leaves happy, and your comments help us stay true to that promise."}
{"text":"It's fall and that means time for pumpkin spice Shakes. Got a pumpkin spice Shake, but because whoever was mixing them is a lazy piece of poop There was a ton of Reese peanut butter cups in the shake. Plus it was half mixed. Wasn't busy. Just lazy. Couldn't drink it. Also if you run out of your pumpkin mix don't go buy pumpkin pie filling for your shakes. It was crap compared to any other pumpkin spice shake ive had.."}
{"text":"The best Burgers in Town!!!!!  I have been hooked on their yummy burgers since the first bite.  I used to always drive by this place and notice that the parking lot was always packed........and no wonder, they are Wonderful!!!!!  Their custards are extremely yummy too :)  Worth the drive from North Scottsdale.  I haven't tried anything else off their menu besides the burgers, custard and fries.  Always tell myself that I will next time but when the time comes I just can't pass up my favs :)"}
{"text":"I understand you can only get so much out of a group of 15 year olds working the establishment but you need an adult there!

While they could be cleaning and assisting other customers they continued to giggle and ignore the order screens.

The custard was reasonably priced but the taste was not worth it."}
{"text":"Really good place for lunch or fast food better than your average burger joint! Culvers offer more of a deluxe burger. They are good size and offer many tasty sides the cheese curds are pretty tasty as well. Also, they have seasonal combos for food and concrete mixer which i highly recommend. I mainly go to culvers for their amazing concrete mixers. Their flavor of the day always changes plus you get two free mix ins for the concrete mixers! I am a huge fan of their cheesecake options you can get just about any berry and cheesecake combo! Friendly staff and they usually have coupons available.

try their-
Butter burger/ with or without bacon
Sweet potato fries
Concrete mixers- Ask about their seasonal specialties"}
{"text":"So glad these are creeping into the South. A true Midwestern gem. If you've never tried a butter burger, your mind is about to be blown. Good crinkle fries. I also like their other menu items (just rarely get them bc butter burgers are life)-chicken tenders, fish fillet sandwich, even their green beans are tasty. Amazing custard, and you can usually fill out a survey on your receipt for a free one. Good service, clean dining room."}
{"text":"I love Culver's. For some reason I never recognized Culver's and always skipped it for somewhere else. That was a big mistake. I started going there more often and started getting the butterburgers. I love them so much. This location is like many of all the other Wisconsin Culver's locations. Always good service, etc... defiantly recommend this over this over other fast food locations in the area."}
{"text":"I visit the valley once a year in March during spring break from Tampa, Florida.

Last year my dad takes me to Culver's. Except I didnt know what the place was called. I just knew the burgers were awesome and the logo was blue and white.

So my sister moves out here 6 months ago and I insist that she finds the blue and white place with the great burgers. She has no idea what I am talking about and it remains a mystery till I get back this year and yelp it.

Yes. Culver's. Freakin delicious. We found it on Yelp. We ate the delicious burgers, the fries, the onion rings, even the cheese curds. Everything. WAS. AWESOME. 

I will miss you when I get back to florida, Culvers. I love you. 

Sigh. 

No photo attached because I went nuts on the food as soon as it got to the table. 

#sorrynotsorry"}
{"text":"I don't frequent fast food chains.  There are always so many other options.  Culver's is an exception.  Their fish sandwiches are incredibly good and the milkshakes and concretes are offensively delicious.  The young folks who work at every Culver's I've ever visited seem sincerely nice.  C'mon, where are your deadpan looks and surly attitudes?  Oh, these restaurants are always clean, too.  This is not normal.  Something is wrong here.

If I'm ever a passenger in your car, please ignore me when I scream and badger you to drive to any nearby Culver's.  I'm too old to be downing chocolate shakes every five minutes."}
{"text":"I eat here often because it's right next door to my work. I usually only get a plain single butter burger with mashed potatoes and gravy.  That order is the least in calorie count and it's good."}
{"text":"Ok so as a veg this place isnt too great to eat but the frozen custard HELLO mmm mmmm mmmmm!! You can have it any way you want it and that my fellow Yelper's, gives this girl some much needed pleasure ;)!! The staff is so frign delightful here I thought I walked into another dimension with all the politeness that was being dished out at such high doses. This is may be the best fast food place to hit the valley. 

I had the Avocado Pecan Bleu Salad w the ras. vinaigrette see pic. It was a perfect dinner for me last night and then topped it off with a caramel CASHEW sundae. Cashew's?!?!?! Are you serious.....wow!! Go here like NOW!!

P.S. Thanks to Greg for recommending!!

*I cant find my picture lol*"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Culver's! Love their food, and menu, their staff is always helpful and nice! :)"}
{"text":"Nothing Special

Culvers is an decent place to grab a good lunch or dinner.  However, I didnt find anything special or spectacular.

Culvers offers some different items from the ordinary burger shops.  Today, I had a grilled chicken sandwich and french fries and cost about $8. I guess Culver's has better fast food  than most other fast food restaurants but nothing I would go out of the way for. 

All in all I guess it's a nice change of pace from the typical,  Wendy's or McDonald's.  Maybe, next time I will spluge and try one of the Ice cream treats look very good."}
{"text":"Just fine fast food.  It's more expensive than, say McDonald's, but the meat tastes like meat and not a firm grey sponge.  Good shakes too.  And don't forget those evil-y delicious Cheese Curds dipped in Ranch."}
{"text":"They flat out forgot our order. We sat in the driveway at the drive-thru while car after car got their order and left. You would assume, someone would have the observation and intelligence to come and check to see if we got our order. Apparently the help there is not only incompetent, but they lack any true customer service and critical thinking skills. When I went into to complain, and get my money back, the kitchen was full of little teenagers standing around chatting no one actually working to service customers. The best bet is to not go to this restaurant until they fix their customer service issues."}
{"text":"If you've read some of my other reviews you'll see a trend. 

Kohl's Department Stores.....Brewers spring training...... 

Yep, I'm a cheesehead. (But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head, shoot me. Really.) 

What can I say? I like Culver's. It reminds me of home. It's total comfort food. 

Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts. What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye? The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh. And tasty. 

Culver's is known for their frozen custard. What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culver's, looked at their sign, checked out the 'flavor of the day', and gone, \"Hey, that sounds good!!\", and quickly pulled into the parking lot? 

If you're from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories. 

Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....that's the whole charm behind Culver's. You DO feel like you're in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states. 

Granted I'm not the best person to review Culver's....I'm a little biased towards it. But if you want a 'different' kind of fast food experience and you've never been to the upper Midwest, it's a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there. 

Give it a chance....see if you like it."}
{"text":"Horrible, burnt, expensive , burger! It left a burnt taste in my mouth and a bad feeling in my tummy! It's a no go!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried their burgers and other sandwiches YET but intend to if they are anywhere as good as the soft freeze they serve.  Multiple flavors including a special one every day.  Decent prices, good size portions, fair prices, clean place, friendly staff. interesting looking fish sandwiches.  Soft Freeze the way it was intended to be, mmm!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out through the drive through window and needed to park just past it to wait for my order.  They gave me a plastic number to put on my window sill.  I ordered 3 pork tenderloin sandwiches and oh my, were they large!  The bun had to be almost 5 inches round and the tenderloin, fried crispy, stuck out about an inch all the way around.  I had planned to eat two of them but saved one as I was stuffed.  Also had a strawberry shake which was delicious too.  Great value and service, the meat was very tender with a crisp tasty breading and lots of add ons - red onions, lettuce, mayo, mustard, and pickle.  I have had their fries in the past and they were good too.  I will come back as I can't get a fried pork tenderloin sandwich anywhere else that I know of, it's worth the return!"}
{"text":"First timer for me, after hearing all the raves about the great food.  The double deluxe burger was VERY good--as good or better than In/Out but they are not as generous with onion as IN/Out is.  French frys can't hold a candle to IN/Out.  Will try their cheese curds or onion rings next time to see if any better. The custard was a big disappointment.  I admit I don't think I've ever had frozen custard before but I'll take DQ soft serve or almost ANY frozen yogurt over what I tasted on this trip to Culvers."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the double deluxe cheeseburger there was one big mess to eat. It fell apart in my hands as I picked it up. This is a sandwich I would not order again! I've been here and I've had the chicken tenders their wonderful and I would eat them again but this time I thought I would try the sandwich what a disappointment. If you want to go through a supply of napkins then the sandwiches for you. Way to messy when your burger falls apart!!!!!"}
{"text":"I SO wanted to like Culver's. After finishing up an evening meeting we walked over to have dinner. We placed our order quickly and then went to fill our drinks. I know it was just after the rush hour but the drink station was a mess. There was liquid all over the place and straw paper wrappers everywhere. 

The food was just so-so. I had a sour dough burger. The bread was mushy and the burger tasteless. Did not like the cheese curds at all. My husband had the fish and he said it was average. For what it cost, I'd rather go elsewhere else. 

One thing I loved, the quotes on the walls were nicely done and inspirational.  Good job here."}
{"text":"This is my first time to Culver's and boy, I enjoyed the burger. I took the Culver's Bacon Deluxe with fries and a strawberry shake. The bun was toasted to perfection and the meat was cooked exactly to my taste. The fries and shake were excellent too. Overall, it is a wonderful place to get a quick meal. All thanks to my gf for taking me here. I will keep visiting this place."}
{"text":"I've heard the name, and on rare occasion seen a sign.  First time I've gone in, mostly because our daughter wanted a frozen custard.

This is fast food.  I wasn't sure before I walked in if it was like McD's or Chili's.  Well, more like McD's.  Or maybe Johnny Rockets.

I decided I may as well sample it, so I ordered a burger with fries and a chocolate shake.  My wife and daughter shared a salad (chicken caesar I think).  They like their salad.

My burger was adequate.  I would say, after eating it, that it was more like Fatburger or Johnny Rockets than it was like McD's.  Which is a good thing.  The flavor was fine, and I didn't get that lead-weight-in-my-stomach feel I get from places like McD's.  The fries were cooked properly and salted just right.

The shake was a tad thin, but reasonably tasty.  I've had better, but it was OK.  Definitely better than most other fast-food places, but not as good as Red Robin or Johnny Rockets.

In a pinch I might stop back.  I could eat here again.  I can't rave about the food, but it was OK.  So I'm rating it \"OK\" (3-stars)."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Culver's, but that doesn't mean all Culver's are good. This location is great however and are usually pretty busy! Today was my first time going through drive-thru and I must admit I was a little bit hangry and just wanted to eat!!! The guy taking my order was so positive and upbeat he changed my mood instantly! Wow! This guy was exceptional! I'm telling you, if you're having a bad day, I hope you come here and order with this guy! The girl at the window was very sweet and friendly and so was the person who brought my food. They were extremely busy but I got my delicious food in less than 5 minutes with impressive customer service on top of it! I got a cheddar melt basket and mini concrete mixer.... and everything was better than I hoped for...smooth creamy custard, warm crunchy onion rings (I sub out the fries) and a wonderful cheesy cheddar melt, YUM!!! Thank you Culver's!!!!"}
{"text":"Good Burgers and Sandwiches. Prompt and friendly service is always nice, clean place too ! Don't forget Desert !"}
{"text":"Chocolate custard is the best !!  Nice n creamy....love it. One day will have to try the cheese curds!  Chicken fingers burgers fries n onion rings have been good too.  Fast food but tastes great not processed reasonable prices.....like when u get the survey for free cup or cone of custard !"}
{"text":"Culver's turned out to be a pretty decent place. Being an East Coast transplant, I had no idea what Culver's was all about. I had heard that it was a burger joint. I had heard it was an ice cream place. Turns out that it's both. And, ultimately, this place is at LEAST average on both fronts.

The wife, daughter, and I were in the area, and we were looking for something new to eat. We wanted something that didn't immediately make us say, \"Ugh...I'm so tired of *fill-in-the-blank*.\" This new Culver's was just what we were seeking.

The restaurant is brand new, having opened its doors just about a month ago. So, the facility is in immaculate shape. Everything is fresh and clean, making for a pleasant dining experience.

The first thing about this place that caught my eye was a gilded calf just inside the main entrance http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a58ItFHWoVwVWDqSH_9bEw?select=Wrvpw66fEyR8neoZYmjjXg#-t9iRllIvbKBLZaWjcL69Q. I think I understand why it's there...most of Culver's items come right from cows (burgers, cheese curds, etc). So, the \"cow\" is their proverbial gold mine. (I'm definitely not an art critic...but, that's what the art says to me.)

The next thing that got to me was the menu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a58ItFHWoVwVWDqSH_9bEw?select=Wrvpw66fEyR8neoZYmjjXg#XiNJDI7eiKOrxdYWZeoj1w. The menu is completely automated, making for a very clean and sleek appearance. I dig it when things are simple, yet effective. This nifty menu meets both criterion.

This place is, ultimately, a \"create your own burger\" type of place. When you go, it would behoove you to have a pretty good idea of what it is that you want on your burger. For me, I love bacon and jalapenos. All you have to do at Culver's is ask for what you want. How easy is that?

Now, I don't know about you, but I HATE the process of putting a lid on my drink. I'd like to think that I'm not a paranoid germaphobe, but when it comes to drink lids, even I am weak. I always grab two lids...just so I can throw away the top lid to get to the untainted bottom lid. Here at Cluver's, they've completely eliminated my irrational fear of germs. They have a \"lid dispenser\" that pulls one lid automatically every time you close and open the lid http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a58ItFHWoVwVWDqSH_9bEw?select=Wrvpw66fEyR8neoZYmjjXg#BETqeWzMkBhyr4dGaankvQ. Yes, Yes, Y-E-S!!!

Ultimately, the food was decent. The burger was thin, but I could tell that it was because they pounded the heck out of it with a meat tenderizer. The choice of jalapenos and bacon are ALWAYS a good choice, in my opinion. Thankfully, they also have sweet potato fries.

Since the weather has broken, outdoor seating has become prime real estate. Culver's has an outdoor seating area that wraps around half of the building http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a58ItFHWoVwVWDqSH_9bEw?select=Wrvpw66fEyR8neoZYmjjXg#GSj8kIUJhW5lizAQ_rDxzg. We didn't notice any misters, but there were some pretty decent fans.

At the end of our meal, my daughter pointed out that there was a coupon for a free scoop of the ice cream \"flavor of the day\" on the back of her meal bag http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a58ItFHWoVwVWDqSH_9bEw?select=Wrvpw66fEyR8neoZYmjjXg#e7cavSkGnPWDcMH5LS_Syw. All you have to do is peel this coupon off of the kids' meal bag, and your child gets a cone filled with one scoop of that particular day's flavor. Thankfully for us, today's flavor was \"Double Marshmallow Oreo\". What delicious mess this cone made! 

Being that this place is just around the corner from where we live, I envision that my daughter and I will share many a cone from this place!"}
{"text":"This is an Upgrade of \"in n out\" 
said by all 5 of the friends i came to eat with (2-24-12)

great burgers (even though i normally dont eat burgers)
quality in meat was exceptional as well as the service
but one thing really boosted my thought about this place
it was the thing that looked like ice cream lol
amazing."}
{"text":"What Can I say 0-2 at this place. Went back the second time to get a replacement burger that they didn't give me on a nearly $50.00 drive thru order. 
Didn't give me too much hassle to replace the burger, they promised to leave note for other crew members, no note of course.
I ordered more food to go with replacement burger, was given 2 bags and an Apology for last order screw up.
Drove away before checking new order. Half way home, guess what? No sundaes.   Huh?
I guess its safe to say I will have to try again when I pick up missing order in the future.
I don't think they care. Beware!!!!"}
{"text":"One word, \"AWESOME!\" These guys know all about making butter burgers and the best hand-crafted root beer I have ever had."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on 1/18/18, and had the fish and chips. It was good and the fries were great. I asked for them well done and they were perfect"}
{"text":"Culver's is a good quality fast food joint. The meals are better than most chains but they are not short of grease. The concrete mixers are what I go in for!"}
{"text":"We eat at a variety of Culver's locations often enough, and we do because we love them.  But I was a tick disappointed with my Chicken Bacon Bleu salad this time.  I'm being picky, but there was a few icky pieces of lettuce (love that its mixed greens though!), only 3 grape tomatoes, and kind of a lack of toppings.  The chicken itself was decent but not the best I've had.  My husband's kids' meal was supposed to come with cheese curds but they gave him fries so he went up to the counter to let them know.  They sadly said they had to throw away the fries (which she did) and then gave him the cheese curds.  Not sure if that is a policy of theirs or what, but it was sorta painful to see completely fine food wasted....I meannnnn being pregnant I coulda found a good home for those fries!!  Little stuff like this won't stop us from visiting Culver's in the future; it just wasn't it's best showing this time."}
{"text":"You get 3 stars, you can have another one when you can give me gluten free hamburger and non dairy ice cream or custard .
When my Alex gets a hankering for a butter burger, i eat a burger with out a bun or a salad, yay me! its really hard to smell the goodness of your burgers and french fries and cheese curds. 
I have one other thing to mention, my Alex ordered a concrete mixer and we ordered it to go, driving away we notice, its more like a shake then a mixer. I think that someone needs to pay attention to details better. Just sayin.
We will be back because your burgers are additive, so im told by that guy i ate lunch with."}
{"text":"So yummy!  Hmmm ... what don't I like about Culver's?  Almost nothing!  Deluxe double butter burger, pumpkin spice shake, crinkly fries, cheese curds, build-your-own concrete mixer, I could go on and on.  They bring your food whether you sit inside or out.  The service is polite, not super friendly, but polite and fast.  This particular Culver's is hopping, I swear the drive through line is always out to the street.  

Okay, the burger patties are a little overcooked for my taste.  But they're still good.  And the frozen custard is really excellent.  

Bacon Deluxe value basket with cheese curds and iced tea here I come!"}
{"text":"Standard Culver's.....excellent service using drive-thru, fresh food and hot food worth the wait :)

I ordered the fish cod filet with tarter on the side....keeps the sandwich from being soggy.

My Dr. Pepper tasted like farts (sulphur) so me thinks the water for the soda machine is not filtered or maybe somebody just forgot to change the filter?

Other than that everything else was fresh and filling."}
{"text":"Also all the negative reviews are about price, so go get shitty service somewhere else along w crappy food. Boom"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a greasy unhealthy flavor packed delicious piece of meat you found the place to go. 

That is not a negative statement these burgers are absolutely delicious, but boy are they bad for you. The crinkle fries are mighty fine too

Their staff is always happy to help as well, a nice change of pace for fast food"}
{"text":"If you are from the Midwest...then this place is a little piece of home. The food is great and the service is impeccable. I have a Culver's in my hometown of Marquette, Michigan but can honestly say that I have never ever been there, due to the fact they came to town after I moved to AZ...but all my friends back home swear by it and as soon as this place opened up, my buddy here from Chicago swore by it up and down, he said that he was really happy that one opened up so close to him because he normally drives to the one location in Mesa at least once a month to get his fix so with all this raving I had to go try it out. 

I got the Mushroom n Swiss single with cheddar cheese fries and a strawberry smoothie...REAL CHEESE...OMG REAL CHEESE...amazing. To say the least the burger was good, the cheese chili fires are a heart attack in a tray and the smoothie was outstanding. 
I will say this about Culver's even though I enjoyed it thoroughly if you are on a diet this is not the place for you, almost everything on their menu has upwards of 600 calories or more...in fact I saw some things like their 4 piece fried chicken has over 2000 calories. So not a great place for dieters...it doesn't help either that they sell pints and quarts of their ice cream to go....by the way which is also delicious. 

What I felt was nice about this location is that you can sit inside and they open up the front of the store with these huge bay doors to out door seating which allowed for a cool night breeze to come in and you feel like you sitting outdoors indoors. Great big TV's with sports on...and a ton of staff to basically take care of your every need while you eat.

Culver's is definitely worth the visit. The food is great and the service is untouchable for a fast food place. If you have never been I highly suggest going at least once to check it out."}
{"text":"Prices are a concern in a competitive market and In-N-Out beats Culver's price wise.

Burgers are good but too greasy for my preference. Fries are not as good as  In-N-Out but comparable to McDonald's et al. Malts and custards are expensive and loaded with calories - but competitive with Dairy Queen.

Service -- Good
Location -- OK
Price -- Relatively high"}
{"text":"Very slow service 20 min to receive two scoops of the flavor of the day and a short brownie concrete mixer, seemed like the staff were all in slow gear and acted like they were not sure what to do. Ice cream was very soft"}
{"text":"Had the Culver's Deluxe and it was dry! And the fries were from the freezer. Can't believe how different each location is. Next tome, SMASH BURGER!"}
{"text":"Employees always friendly.   Good variety of food.  Not greasy like in&out.  Good overall experiences at these places"}
{"text":"New to this area and had never seen this chain before so decided to give it a shot. The food is good as far as flavor, the issue I have is the meat to bun ratio. The burgers have little more meat on them than a Krystal or White Castle but they have a full size bun. Just wish for a little more. Malts are great though!"}
{"text":"Culver's is probably the best tasting fast food places there is- this location used to have really terrible service. However, I have noticed a great improvement the last few times that I have visited."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for their custard. What a perfect way to fulfill a sweet tooth craving without having to get out of the car! While running some errands, we decided it was time for a sweet treat and since we were in the area, my husband decided to introduce me to the custard at Culver's. We pulled through the drive-through and I took a look at the custard menu. I was told that the Concrete Mixer is the way to go so I had to give it a try! I ordered the mini vanilla Concrete Blizzard with Heath Crunch and Reece's Peanut Butter Cups. Let me just say that the mini is no mini! With the richness of the custard along with the candy, it filled me up quickly! The custard is extremely creamy and delightful and the vanilla was very refreshing for a hot summer night. I am typically more of a chocolate fan and will get a chocolate one next time, but this time, I got to enjoy a couple bites of my husband's chocolate with Reece's and peanut butter. Yum! This is a great option if you're craving something sweet and don't want to get out of your car!"}
{"text":"The onion rings at this restaurant are amazing, with the perfect amount of batter on them. The bacon butterburger is truly delicious. Also, the employees are courteous and provided a wonderful customer experience. I will be bringing my family and friends with me to this restaurant very soon."}
{"text":"2nd time at this location and the same girl in the drive thru has attitude no matter what you ask for she doesn't repeat the order to make sure it's correct, I didn't get a receipt and no napkins  you figure you're eating ice cream it's messy when it melts at least give me some damn napkins woman"}
{"text":"The Very Best chain out there, way better than In n Out. I always choose Culvers over other chains when traveling. A little more expensive than McDs and the like, but probably not on a per calorie basis. 

Mushroom and swiss burger with chili cheese fries and a small cone is my go to, but you really can't go wrong with any burger here. 

This location always has fresh fries and fresh burgers."}
{"text":"I love ice cream. I love hot fudge. I love chopped peanuts. I like when all the above are combined. 

I had never heard of this chain prior to making my first trip out to WI a couple years ago (in spite of having lived in Michigan for 8 years). Cold weather has never stopped me from enjoying some delicious frozen treats, so I got a sundae and loved it. 

This is nothing original nor spectacular. But it's good fast food chain ice cream. 

Oh yeah, if you're into burgers, fries, cheese curds, etc., they also have those. ;)"}
{"text":"So we've been hearing all sorts of buzz about Culver's.. the famous butter burger and frozen custard place from Wisconsin. So we piled in the car and headed out to Mesa. When we got there the place was packed.. we stood in line for 10 minutes before it was our turn. The service is very friendly and super helpful. We even ordered the flavor of the day, caramel cashew swirls and were told we could pick that up later so it didn't melt while we ate our dinner.. that was very cool!

Anyway, you place your order and they give you a number so they can bring it out to you when its ready.. another nice touch. Well after we got our food, butter burgers, fries and cheese curds we felt well, kind of let down. The burgers here are alright, kinda greasy and lacked a good beef flavor. The cheese curds were also deep fried (as most on the menu) and were good but not as good as I was hoping. 

The crowd there.. it was like I was in Iowa or something.. definite Walmart crowd.. I sat there and watched this kid pick his nose and then proceed to fill his soda cup from the soft drink fountain.. uhm, yeah.. I just looked at my cup and thought about all the other people who touched that button.. suddenly didn't feel very good. 

We got our frozen custards.. eh, very very smooth and creamy but to me just tasted like ordinary soft serve ice cream. Cashews were salty and nicely roasted, a good contrast to the smooth custard but lack depth and interest in the overall taste of the frozen custard.

I probably wouldn't ever go back here.. though the service is great and is priced well, I just don't think the food was worth the drive back out to Mesa."}
{"text":"Another chain joins the ranks out in Surprise and I have to say this one is pretty good. Ive been to the one in Mesa and it was lackluster. Though now some time has passed and I went ahead and tried the same things I ordered last time. Double Deluxe Butterburger, Dairyland Cheese Curds and a Chocolate Concrete Shake. 

The burger was juicy though not really discernible considering the butter angle, but tasty none the less as well as fresh and hot. The cheese curds, well I just wish they were just cheese curds plain, rather than battered and deep fried. The chocolate shake was so thick that the straw was pretty much worthless.. pretty tasty when using a spoon. Advice, drop the fried cheese curds into the chocolate shake and eat that way, better than ranch!! 

All in all, kind of boring but pretty solid. Next time Id like to try the fried chicken.. crispy and juicy chicken makes me moist every time!!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I come here every time we are in Stoughton (mainly because there is nothing else to do, and why not eat some frozen treats in the frozen tundra of Wisconsin?) 

I do enjoy the butterburgers, and like to get fried cheese curds, which are hard to find in the Great Northwest. If you are needing some comfort food/gut bomb on a snowday, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I've lived in Madison for about 3 years now and just barely tried Culver's for the first time. Mu husband took me for my birthday lunch (whee!!) and I was treated to my first butter burger. I'm not gonna lie. I had high expectations. Since I'm from CA, people were telling me it's comparable to In n Out. But let's not get carried away! Granted, I've only had one butter burger compared to my xxx amount of times I've had In n Out, but still. 

Anyway! It was definitely a tasty burger. The burger patty certainly has a distinct flavor. You don't really need much to dress it up. My husband has been there before and likes it. We made a deal not to enjoy it too much--we can't come here all the time!"}
{"text":"Usually pretty good burgers. Tonight the service was horrible. The manager tried to resolve the incorrect order but was very condescending and asked me to pay for a single patty addition because the person who took our order messed it up despite he fact that I repeated it to her twice. 

Done with this location of Culver's. And since it is the only one in my area ....."}
{"text":"My son likes Culvers since we don't have any in PA.    

He likes the burgers and cheese curds.   I tried a fry average.   And the chili supreme.  The chili was ok.... Don't bother with paying the extra $1 for the supreme which was a few pieces of onion, some cheese and sour cream.    

I couldn't wait to try the cheese curds.  They didn't have any flavor.   I'd rather have mozerella sticks.    Looking for the best cheese curds the the old Fashion in Madison."}
{"text":"My first time at Culver's... was just as good as people told me. If your looking for a good burger, come out here. The curds where also good."}
{"text":"First time here....Kind of like a souped up Dairy Queen. Bacon cheddar Burger was as good a burger as I've had, cooked perfectly and the Custard/ice cream was delicious. Definately a fan of this establishment. Priced right with good service and very clean as well."}
{"text":"Simple. Great food as expected. Great service as expected. Ice cream anyone? Especially after eating all that great food how could you pass that up. Nothing else to say besides if your hungry an passing by this place which to me is like in-n-out burger you just got to stop an eat here. Everything's great. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I have been to many, many Culvers from all the way back to when Culvers was only a Wisconsin institution.  Culvers runs a good organization, but the Culvers on the Beltline is the best. We will drive past other Culvers along with many other restaurants just to get to this particular store.  Here are a few things that sets them apart from the rest:
1.  Greet customers as they enter the store.
2.  Find a way to adapt an order to meet the customer's needs, not the rules...pleasantly. 
3.  They bring your order out to you. 
4.  When they deliver your order, they ask if there's anything else you need and then get it for you. 
5.  If there are any problems with the order, they fix it without hesitation. 
6.  The staff that clean the dining room ask if they can take your tray and dispose of trash for you. When you thank them, they indicate that it is no problem. 
7.  Unless they are slamm d at the counter, they also thank you and say good-bye as you are leaving. 

John is one of the crew leaders during lunch, when we are there, and he models these great customer service behaviors.   We will continue to drive past the others to get to the Culvers on he Beltline."}
{"text":"years ago, we couldn't find a frozen custard shop in phoenix without taking a tremendous, all-day affair journey to the far east....valley. now they seem to be all over the place. 

culvers is cute...reminds me of dairy queen back when ice cream was cool to eat. i did have a little trouble trying to figure out how to order. there's all kinds of funky flavors and add-on's that a slow southerner like me has to process before ordering. luckily the counter girl explained how it worked and we were set. 

the wife had the mint chocolate chip, and although i've never been a fan of that flavor, i actually liked the custard version. i picked the vanilla with p-butter and banana and it was freaking delicious! very rich and creamy, and even a small was too much for me...you know, trying to watch my awesome figure. we paid about 7 bucks for 2 smalls. 

after you order, you have a seat and they bring it to you. apparently you can get burgers there as well (DQ all over again). 

summer is always a great time for a cool treat and since it's nearly summer all year long in phoenix, it's always cool treat time. thanks to culvers for keeping us satisfied."}
{"text":"Stopped by this Culver's last night with a coupon that we got in the mail for a buy one get one free value basket. The cashier at the front was super nice. I didn't get her name but she offered great service, provided suggestions on what to order, and was overall very pleasant. We got our two value baskets and they were pretty good. Burgers aren't my favorite here but for a fast food burger, it gets the job done. The best things here hands down are there cheese curds. So delicious. I also really like their shakes here. I normally don't write reviews for fast food restaurants but the service here inspired me to give them a shout out! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This particular Culvers has really gone downhill. I was there on a Saturday,near 8 in the evening. They were crowded,but still no excuse for poor service,crappy attitudes,and food that is worse is worse than any of the fast food places that I know of. Their fish sandwich,which once was one of their best items on the menu is the worst. I also believe it's gotten smaller in size. No more Culvers for me."}
{"text":"Customer service is freaking amazing ! Great food, great staff, great location. Place is very clean and fast! Will for sure be back !"}
{"text":"Very good food. Their custard is so creamy and they have so many options for flavors and toppings. The employees are less than enthusiastic and the drive thru takes forever!"}
{"text":"Dear Culver's,

It was love at first sight.  I saw your ad for concrete mixers in the local newspaper and I just knew you were the \"one.\"  When I finally got up the nerve to meet you in person, everything I'd hoped for came true.

Visiting Culver's was like going to Disneyland.  The staff is uber-friendly and bend over backwards to please.  I love your smiles!  But, what really slays me is the decadent, delicious food you create and serve.  Your frozen custards are luscious and seriously, cheese curds?  Insanely good.

Thank you for being my real first crush in Phoenix.

XOXO"}
{"text":"This Culver's has great customer service. Food is always good and consistent. Food is cooked to order, hot, juicy and delicious!  I would not call Culver's a fast food hamburger joint. It's menu is similar to McDonald's, Wendy's, etc. i.e.  burger offerings, non-burger offerings, sides, etc., however, the food quality is superior. I enjoyed the burger and the service was good."}
{"text":"I have to say for a fast food restaurant. Good food good customer service and the strawberry sundae was great."}
{"text":"I loove Culver's! Their cheese curds are amazing! The people are friendly and everything on the menu is damn good!"}
{"text":"I'm from Wisco.... glad to finally see a Culvers in Chandler.  Can't go wrong with a Burger and Cheese Curds.  Very clean and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Great place to get quick great food!! You have to try there cheese curds! They definitely are the most unhealthy thing you can eat but a great treat every blue moon!! And don't forget to check on and get a free ice cream!! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"The food IS good but there's 2 things that bother me.
1. The people who take your oder have a tendency to cut you off.
2. Good god it's expensive!"}
{"text":"Go to Michael's for custard. Culver's is okay for fast food, but that's about it.

There are much better options in most towns of any size. I'd suggest taking a few minutes more to get to them if you want a sit down meal."}
{"text":"Bomb! Burger was so good, tasted fresh. I hate to say this, but better than In-n-out. Fries weren't that great. But I'm definitely coming back next time I crave a burger. Ice Cream and Burgers in one stop, I'm there!"}
{"text":"Californians are all about the In-N-Out, where you can get your burger animal style. And the Midwest is all about Culver's, where the Butter Burger is the thing to order.

C. and I ate lunch here on our way between Milwaukee and Mosinee before going to my folks for Christmas. I got a cheddar burger with fries, and C. got the two-piece chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and green beans.

That's one of the things I love about Culver's. Yes, it's a fast food restaurant. But they also do family restaurant food well. The chicken was good and the green beans really fresh, C. said. Fast food you can feel good about.

I also got a frozen custard, their flavor of the day: Swiss almond Christmas or something like that. Chocolate custard with slivered almonds. Yummo."}
{"text":"One of the few places I will eat a burger. I love the option of cheese curds instead of fries. 1.30 upcharge a little steep though.  
Great option for a bite after Ikea shopping."}
{"text":"I love frozen custard! Imagine super rich and creamy soft serve and that's frozen custard. As Shannon C. mentioned, they'll always have vanilla or chocolate and you can build your own sundae for as little as $2.39 (includes 1 scoop and 2 toppings) and they make something similar to a Blizzard (Concrete Mixer) for $2.89 (short size) but I keep an eye on the flavor of the day (http://www.culvers.com/flavors.aspx?storeId=399) for my guide. 

I mean, seriously, Double Marshmallow Oreo (Rich chocolate custard loaded with Oreo cookie pieces and marshmallow creme)? Or, Butter Brickle (Specially blended butter pecan custard enhanced with all-time favorite chewy chunks of Heath Bar.)  Who could resist a special trip!?!

Culver's is known for their ButterBurgers, though. It's worth noting that unless you order a Deluxe you have to specify which of the toppings like mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, pickles, onions, tomato and lettuce you want; otherwise, ya just get a buttered bun! They make a big deal about the meat being \"fresh, never frozen 100% US raised\" and cooked to order and they're pretty tasty, but this is a fast food burger, not what I like to refer to as a \"backyard burger.\" So keep your expectations in check an you will be pleased.

The counter service has been good each time I've visited, but I have to give a shout out to my favorite, Luther, who broke it all down for me and, no doubt, made my first visit to the Metro location go smooth. 

It's worth noting they have items besides burgers, like salads and pot roast dinners. Although I haven't ventured there yet, I happen to be a fan of pork tenderloin sandwiches and am looking forward to giving the one at Culver's a try.  But, it's going to have to be on a day that I cannot resist the Flavor of the Day... maybe Friday for Strawberry Cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Bathrooms under construction, noticeable waits for the basics, and then botched orders.  Fantastic chain, this site just needs some fine tuning...."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Culvers! Omg I'm pregnant with my third child and this is all I crave! Best burgers in the world!   Hot, juicy, tasty, seasoned just right! Fries and cheese curds are delicious! The molts are heaven to me. I never have a horrible experience with culvers and I go often. Amazing customer service at every location I been to. I love this place so much! I would rate a 10 star if I could! 

MaYbe a little pricier than most fast food but it's worth every penny. Also they play cool music in the dinning area. I think it's a christian based company and that is also why I love it so much."}
{"text":"It's what a burger should be.  Greasy dead delicious animal on a bun.  I always go with the double bacon deluxe, and cheese curds.  Their company root beer is good, and their frozen custard is too.  This is my favorite burger to eat when hungover.  The grease comforts my stomach."}
{"text":"Terrible. Literally idiotic management of a business and my expectations of fast food are pretty low. They managed to not even meet that very low bar. Waited 5 minutes to order and then 20 MINUTES for the food. At that point, I was already in overflow parking and the worker asked me if I would move to another area after waiting 20 min so that they could fit more people waiting?!?!?

I asked, \"Are you sure it's not ready? I've been waiting here 20 minutes.\" No apology. She responds rudely that \"everyone is waiting\", which was in fact, true. 

Good news. I'll never have to wait there again!!!"}
{"text":"Although the staff is pleasant the food was not. The hamburger patty  was so burnt and so thin I could nearly see through it. Management definitely needs to check into who is cooking the food. Plus our order was wrong. I had to return the horrible patty. I felt bad because it was my idea to come here and I disappointed my mother so much. I also feel bad watching my niece scarf down a burger I didn't know was charred beyond recognition until the end but I should've figured since mine was pretty burnt. Shame on me. And shame on this restaurant for serving such low quality food."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, attentive, and the quality is consistent. They train their employees good and you can tell they are organized. Today they even opened the door for me and offered a large carry bag to carry my lunch for coworkers. They are fantastic for workplace orders and will even write the name's of people if you ask them to, on their orders."}
{"text":"Can't believe I have not reviewed this locale because it is within walking distance of my Apt. I don't go here very often....but the other night I was craving Ice cream and since I had a free coupon I decided to pay Culver's a visit. I am always impressed with the Customer Service that I receive.....and usually I get my order fairly quickly. This occasion was no different.....I also have to mention that the Wisconsin Cheese Curds are a MUST. The establishment is very clean....very well lit....and even the outdoor seating is delightful. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was great . My son worked here and the employees were taught to be very courteous and friendly. I'm not sure what happened to that , but it's definitely not like that now. You are not greeted with a smile , in fact it's the opposite . We also have recently come twice about 15 minutes before close and both times \"the grill wasn't working\" hmmm kind of coincidental. The burgers are still great, so I will still give 3 stars , but because of the service , I may not come back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast food done right, than this is the place. This place started out in Wisconsin and has migrated to other states. The food is always hot, served fast, and super delicious! Their frozen custard is amazing and rich. A must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food and Service. Place looks Fabulous. Highly recommended it to everyone. Fantastic menu to choose from. Did I mention the Egg Nog Shake...oh my it's the BEST"}
{"text":"Service: terrible. Concrete mixers: delicious. If you can stand waiting a RIDICULOUS amount of time for drive through,  this Culver's is fine. Last night, 8/5/15, we had to repeat our order 5, yes FIVE, times before the girl could repeat it correctly.  We ordered 2 concrete mixers, and she kept repeating our (simple) order with the wrong mixers in it. We then wait no less than 10 minutes at the window for our order... all while watching an employee text/play on her cell phone right on view of the drive through window. Unprofessional and frustrating."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! I love the ice cream! The lines are a little long, but they move pretty quick. The employees are very friendly. Great place to take a family to dine."}
{"text":"NOTE:: I have ONLY been here for the custard!!

I have been here a handful of times (again, only for the custard / concretes), and everyone has always been friendly and helpful. Inside has always been nice and clean. The custard is pretty good (especially for a chain)... but I have had a few that are a bit better (unfortunately none are nearby, so when I'm having that rare craving for concretes, this does it for me!)"}
{"text":"Love the great quality food, especially for the price! There are plenty of staff who are very eager to help. The dining room was packed but they were there helping clear tables and wipe them down. Although it took about 15 minutes to get our food, they are new, so it was fine with me. My food was hot and delicious. After having a minor problem with my order I brought it to their attention, and the way they handled it is another reason they are getting 5 stars. I truly enjoyed my experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh burgers, love the soft bounds and yummy ice cream. Didn't care too much for the cheese curds, because they didn't really taste like cheese. The customer service is superior, which is extremely important to me as a customer. Though I'm faithful to another burger establishment,  I'll be back to Culver's."}
{"text":"This is about the only Culver's that I haven't liked. I went here just once so I could eat before going to the nearby planetarium, but there are reasons why this is the only disliked Culver's to me:

They put too much grease on their burgers (the greasiest burger I've ever eaten), they also put too much grease on their fries, and then, this is the worst: I asked for a two-scoop sundae. Two-scoop sundaes should be 200% the size of a one-scoop sundae, not 115% like my sundae!

Only reason this place redeemed itself is they took the sundae back and added the full scoop on top. There are other places to go before/after planetarium shows on the West Side, and there are other Culver's. Stay away from this Culver's!"}
{"text":"The parking/drive thru is always insane, but since I eat inside (I come here on my bike), that's not a worry.

Anyway, unlike a few Culver's I've been to, this one doesn't have too much grease on their burgers and fries, and they make sure to scoop the right amount of frozen custard onto your sundae (and the toppings too), and they charge solid prices."}
{"text":"How can you mess up a burger? I was excited to have something fast and convenient nearby. I would rather eat gas station than food than this lackluster fast food place. It just isn't good, what I don't understand is how they keep opening new places throughout the valley. This place is a joke. Oh and I did give them several chances. I tried their fish, burger and assorted items on the menu....still fail. I don't eat McDonald's but I would rather eat that garbage instead of this. Actually close this place down and bring something else here. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at a few Culver's locations. The food and ice cream have always been excellent. They have a nicely diverse menu and of the different items I have tried they always were prepared well. So many times a restaurant with this many different menu items would have some good and some ok, but not Culver's. Don't forget the ice cream!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the delicious gift of deep fried cheese curds!"}
{"text":"this is a a bit of a twilight zone for me.  It's light and bright and airy.  the workersI all have uniforms and bright cheery smiles on their faces.  They don't even look disgruntled like most teenagers.  The day I went, there was a reservation for a group of bright eyed precocious children reviewing their performances of a school production of \"Grease\".  Everyone was happy.  The quotes on the wall are very midwestern, bible belt type.  But the malts, oh the malts.  I have't had a vanilla malted in years.  They make it with their vanilla custart and i asked for extra malt, so much it was nearly crunchy.  The malt was perfect, thick, (spoon necessary) and good to the last spoonful, not too sweet, not too runny.  All for the princely sum of $3.00.  I could almost see myself donning a blue uniform and a smile while humming the tune Greased Lightning...."}
{"text":"We ate there at 3 in the afternoon.  There were very few customers there.  There was one man who had all of the counter help wrapped up in conversation.  A young lady promptly left the group to take my order.   A very simple straight forward order I thought.  Veggie burgers with no onion and one with no mayo.  We are both vegetarians and I try to be vegan as much as possible. Burgers arrived and yep you guessed it.  Mayo.  The order was placed correctly.  This is not the first time the cooks have messed up.  Last time we got two beef patties wrapped in lettuce leaves.  We have a \"list\". Businesses that do not meet our expectations more than once are placed on the list.  Culver's is now on that list.  We will try again in a few months."}
{"text":"A bit higher quality fast food.  Being a WI transplant, I like to get a fish fry every once in a while.  Culver's is the best around here that I've found, but too pricey for the quality.  $12+ for fast food?  I love frozen custard, but I am always disappointed in Culver's.  Freddie's is better tasting, so I go there for custard."}
{"text":"Come here for the sweet treats!! Forget everything else.The frozen custard here is a-mazing!! It's so decadent that you can easily make a meal of it. 

My favorite so far has been a concrete mixer with Reese's PB cups and Marshmallow sauce or wait maybe it was the two scoop sundae with Andes mints and hot fudge? So creamy and delicious that I don't even care I'm lactose intolerant. So worth it....If you join there email list they send several great buy one get one free coupons for sundaes and mixers."}
{"text":"Love this chain in Wi and so nice we can get cheese curds and custard here. For the holidays, they have THE BEST pumpkin custard desserts."}
{"text":"Called into to speak to a manager about a bad experience. I was put on the phone with a woman named Kathy, who was horrendous and I later found out this was the owner! She refused to listen to my bad experience and kept interrupting me to correct me- even though what she was saying was not applicable to what I was saying. I eventually had to ask who was above her because the conversation was going no where and she just hung up on me. Unfathomable how awful the customer service is! The owners are terrible and shouldn't be dealing with paying customers!"}
{"text":"My husband grew up in Wisconsin.   He's so happy that Culver's is now in AZ.   He can have his favorite frozen custard without putting up with the snow."}
{"text":"Same as the others... 

Clean, friendly and good. 

I was able to order a chicken legs and mashed taters for one kid, coleslaw and frys for the other, 2 kids meals for the adults and no one complained. They are always more then happy to help you in anyway possible."}
{"text":"You can combine butter, bread, and meat on one plate and it taste great! The butter burgers are awesome, they are reasonably priced and the place is clean. What more do you want from fast food?"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Ordered the flavor of the day: Mint Oreo. Asked for extra Oreos. I think there was only one Oreo in the whole thing..."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great customer service, unfortunately it's rare to have someone greet you at the window with a big smile on their face and it's a genuine \"how are you today?\" Love it!!"}
{"text":"Watch out for this location.  They take their time.  Boy, do they take their time.  They really like to take their time. Literally, over 20 minutes to get some chicken strips, pork sandwich and two fries.  The pork sandwich was dry and hard. Not worth eating.  Others waiting for their food were waiting as long as 20 minutes also. Everyone who had ordered take out after me had left the building. Won't be going back to this location.  Never had this problem here before."}
{"text":"YUM YUM AND YUM!! I got a Concrete mixer for the first time and it was EXCELLENT!! There were probably over 20 options to choose from to mix in with the frozen yogurt!! I also love that they get their milk from local farms! I would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I think this place has the better butter burger! (Say that three times really fast) Culver's, sure it's another fast food joint but they have great food and exceptional service! They offer a more diverse menu than most places.  It kind of a cross between a Burger joint and the Market Place.  In addition to burgers they offer things like fried cod, fried chicken, pot roast, chopped steak and fried shrimp.  They also offer a selection of different cooked veggies as sides.

But it's all about the burger for me.  The Bacon Deluxe served with two fresh, never frozen, beef patties seasoned well cooked to almost perfection with hot-melty-cheesy goodness, two slabs of bacon, served up hot and fresh on a lightly buttered bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo and pickles.  Now you can create any type of burger you want so don't let their menu deter you from ordering something you would like that may not be on the menu.

They have those crinkle fries and great onion rings.  My family loves their fried cheese curds (little balls of cheese fried, imagine that).  You can get either one covered with chili and cheese if you wish.

Some people go to this place just for the frozen custard but I recommend getting their lemon ice with blue berries! Less filling and really refreshing and tasty!  We've also got one of their frozen custard cakes for a B-Day and it was gone in less than 5 mins!

Here's a Culver's Secret: 
When ever you get a french fry that is longer than seven inches (laugh first, then read on) show it to one of the Culver peeps.  They may give you a free frozen custard in trade for that seven incher! (it's a promo they run every now and then) Also for those on a budget, order the kids combo you'll get a burger, fries and a drink with a free custard!"}
{"text":"Even though I lived in the midwest for 6 years, I never had the chance to try Culver's. Conveniently enough, there's one just 15 minutes or so from my house in Charlotte, located right across the street from Carowinds.

I've been here 3 times in the recent past and get the Sourdough Melt. It's pretty good--they like to advertise that they use fresh beef and cheese which is nice to know. I like to say it's the Chick-fil-a- of burgers--better than average fast food with excellent service.

The custard really is great--I had a mini concrete mixer with Reese's cups and brownie. They put a copious amount of toppings in which was great and the cold, smooth custard hit the spot. The mini size was enough to where I didn't feel like I was going to give myself a heart attack but still was satisfying.

Service is usually very good--no complaints anywhere here. I'd have no problem going back in the future.

Edit: I hate giving fast food places 5 stars, but went back a few more times, and the service here is excellent. 5th star awarded."}
{"text":"Culvers is a great place to take the kids for a treat. I love the burgers, cheese curds and of course, the frozen custard. I love how the kids meals come with a coupon for a kid-sized custard, which you don't have to use on that visit."}
{"text":"Edit (3/11/2011):  I knocked one star off my earlier review.  The last few times I've gone to this Culver's, the food has been hit or miss.  I've tried something new each time (from burgers to chicken salad sandwiches to fried chicken, etc), and half the time I get a great entree.  The other half of the time I get an uber-greasy or bland item.  The custard, though, is always consistently good.  The so-so food plus yummy custard = 3 stars.

My first review:

Culver's is awesome!  My family goes about twice a month.  We have young children, and find Culver's to be pretty kid-friendly.  It's both a fast food place and a frozen custard shop.  As for the custard, it is so creamy, rich, and delicious!  They offer chocolate, vanilla, and a flavor of the day.  You have some options like regular scoops, sundaes, shakes, cakes, cookie sandwiches, and blizzard-type thingies.  Then there's the crazy food menu that has tons of stuff like \"butter burgers\", crinkle fries, fish n chips, fried shrimp, roast beef or fried chicken dinners with sides, hot sandwiches, pork cutlet sandwiches (like a schnitzel sandwich), soups, salads, and more!  Cah-ray-zee!  Not only is the food pretty good, but the seating area is nice and clean, more like eating at a Panera or a Paradise Bakery than at a McDonalds, if you know what i mean.  They have flat panel TVs on the walls (showing news or sports) and an outdoor patio.  You order at the counter, get a number, and they bring your hot, fresh food out to your table fairly quickly.  All this, plus they have a drive-thru!  How they can offer all of their menu items, get them out quickly, and offer them in a drive-thru is beyond me, but they do it!!  DOUBLE CRAZY!

I only have three minor issues/complaints, if you can really call them that.  1) that they are almost always BUSY when we're there, but that's not really a complaint. :)  , 2) for being such a busy place, they don't seem to have enough seating,  and 3) the drink fountain:  It is in such a cramped, high traffic spot in the restaurant, that it often has a group of people waiting to fill up or just trying to get by.  The back-up of people might also be due to the actual fountain being really overly fizzy (i.e. People try to fill their cup and end up with half bubbles, so they spend extra time at the drink station dumping the top half and refilling several times.)  That's happened consistently each time I've gone.

Overall, a very clean, casual, and reasonably priced place to bring the family for dinner and dessert."}
{"text":"Butter Burgers and Frozen Custard it does not get any better, add awesome house made root beer on tap and you have got a winner on your hands folks.  I have loved Culver's since I lived in Illinois, and I am truly elated that they are so close to my Arizona home.  I know most folks live and die by In-N-Out or Five Guys but you gotta check out Culver's you will not be disappointed. They also serve up Shaved prime rib sandwiches, Ruben Sandwiches, Chicken and Fish options. Not to mention the numerous Frozen Custard; there is no way you will ever get tired of the delectable concoctions that are available for dessert. Right at near the corner of Cactus Rd and Greenway Village Parkway on the out side of PV Mall is where will find them. Oops I almost forgot to mention the Cheese curds, alas I could go on and on about Culver's but you really gotta try them for yourself."}
{"text":"The Culver's double deluxe Butterburger . Do I have to say anymore? The only reason I don't give Culver's  5 stars is because the amount of calories lol"}

{"text":"Known for butter burgers and cheese curds, I came to Culver's tonight for their fish sandwich... And cheese curds! 

The curds were gooey good and the fish was a fairly substantial piece of cod. Not only impressive but delicious. But the food was outdone only by the sincere courtesy of the young people serving. As I write this I'm asked by a smiling young guy asking if he can take my tray and garbage. 

Service with a smile and good food. Top marks!"}
{"text":"Dined here about 10 minutes before closing and was served fresh food quickly by friendly staff. Can't do much better than that! I had the crispy chicken sandwich and fish sandwich with fries on the side. The crinkle cut fries were good but my preference would have been a little crispier and with a touch more salt. Both sandwiches were similarly a little bland and could have been kicked up with a splash more of their respective sauces."}
{"text":"Ordered food and concrete mixers in drive through and they hand me the mixers first then park me, by the time I get my food they are halfway melted and I still have to drive home, in Phoenix even at 9pm it's 112 degrees so I don't know why the custard wouldn't be the last thing they hand me. After getting home and about halfway through eating the mixer I find a jagged shard of plastic in it! So gross and unsafe so I call to let them know that there is most likely more in that batch and the girl on the phone could care less. Will not be returning to this location"}
{"text":"Good service,  food was brought out quickly and tasted good. They even had sports on tv and the blonde  server was hot"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we absolutely loved it! The service is excellent from the time your order, to the delivery of food items, to the end of your meal. Glen, the manager, and the entire crew displayed great customer service. The only thing that can improve was that they need toilet seat covers, however, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Culver's, and it kind of seems like the equivalent of a Dairy Queen with cement mixers instead of blizzards and burgers instead of hot dogs. Anyone else get this sense?

Honestly, the ice cream menu seems to be lacking. You really just choose a basic ice cream flavor and add toppings, nothing special at all. I got vanilla ice cream with brownie bits which was tasty, but I just found the lack of selection odd. 

I didn't order any food but I saw another table with a bunch of burgers that were in sealed plastic pouches. It looked ridiculous. Like is this place supposed to be space themed with burgers in plastic pouches and cement ice cream? Just consider me confused. Maybe I'm just unwilling to change, but I think I'll stick with better ice cream places."}
{"text":"On our way back from Taliesin we stopped in here for lunch.

Like all Culver's, this is a nice, clean, well-run operation.

I tried the brisket sandwich and it was pretty good.

Let's not kid ourselves though, I really stopped in for the custard and it was great!"}
{"text":"Burger-good, real good
Fries-just fries, need to crisp them or something
Custard-delicious!
Choc shake-delicious"}
{"text":"Let me state, for the record that my rating has nothing to do with this location or with the service I received during my visit today. Instead, I'm only rating the food that I ordered as it was served to me. 

Based on the copious number of television advertisements, I tried the Wisconsin Big Cheese Pub Burger .  What a catastrophic mistake that was!!  It was a dripping, greasy mess that was almost impossible to eat. So much of a mess that I needed leave the table immediately to thoroughly wash my hands. 

Normally, I'm not adverse to a little grease with a burger since it's normally offset by enhanced flavor. Not this time. I couldn't even taste the cheese!!

So, I will most likely return, but I will never waste my money on this item again."}
{"text":"Good food a little pricy for the amount of food you get. Good for family outing tho clean calm atmosphere and ice cream for dessert. I will definitely try them again. Would be nice if greeted when entering but waited a while until someone finally said il be with you in a minute. I simple hello or how are you would be a good icebreaker no worries tho."}
{"text":"Go-to meal: cheddar butter burger, fried cheese curds, and flavor of the day custard.

The difference between a deluxe burger and cheddar butter burger is that in the deluxe, you'll get American cheese.  And you have to pay 25 cents extra to add lettuce, tomato, etc. to the cheddar butter burger.  File that away in your memory bank."}
{"text":"Love Culver's! ALWAYS GET CHEESE CURDS! Butter burgers are my go to as well! Chicken and fish are also good. However, you can come here for the frozen custard alone! So delicious!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time to Culver's today 04/22/15 & bought 2 Value basket. One was Cod sandwich w/ fries, $7.79 the other was chicken crispy sandwich w/fries.$7.49. I was very disappointed when they handed me both baskets The portion size on both sandwiches were kids meal size. I almost wanted to return them for a refund but I was hungry & I had my son with me I didn't want to walk out If I was alone I would not have hesitated to ask for refund that how small the portion was. How does Culver's justify the prize for the portion? Now if the sandwich tasted so delicious that you had never had anything like it before, then I might have compromise the taste for the small portion! But that wasn't the case either, because it wasn't like WOW taste so good! So today was my first & last time I will ever go to Culver's. I just wonder how long they will be in business before they close their doors or come to their senses & lower the prize to $4.99-$5.99 max."}
{"text":"Generally disappointing. For one thing, I was picturing more of a Perkins or even Denny's type place. Not fast food. It reminded me more of a Dairy Queen than anything else. The man running the cash register was not exactly friendly. The 3 of us had one order of Walleye and 2 orders of fried chicken. He yelled into the back to find out if they had more fried chicken (it was 6pm on a Saturday). Finding out they did, he said we could have the chicken. When our orders came one plate had two large chicken breasts and the other had a spindly wing and drumstick. Everything was super oily, even by the standards of fried fast food. The breading on the chicken was bland and heavy. Hubby said the walleye was decent but bland. Fries were frozen crinkle fries. I didn't try the roll and didn't hear any commentary on the green beans. The cole slaw was apparently decent but sweet (Miracle Whip). 
Although the desserts look intriguing, I probably wouldn't come here again for food."}
{"text":"Had a coupon and have always wanted to try one of their sandwiches.  So went and had the Reuben and fries.  Corned beef was tender and delicious with just the right amount of sauerkraut and cheese.  Bread toasty crispy.  The fries hot and crispy as well.  I need to go back and try one of their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Decent fast food option. Lots of choices plus a variety of sides that you don't find at most fast food restaurants... coleslaw, mashed potatoes, etc. Tables are kept clean. Ice cream treats are yummy. Kid meals are kinda pricey but it does come with a nice dish of ice cream with one add-in."}
{"text":"I am  extremely disappointed in how this particular Culver's location has gone downhill in regards to their frozen custard.  The flavor of the day has gone from stuffed with ingredients to little or none.  The flavor of the day on 8/4 was Butter Pecan and because we like it so much we ordered a pint.  There was absolutely not a  single pecan in the entire container! !!!!  Another example is Peanut Butter Cup flavor of the day - you get just 1 or 2 pieces in it.  So you have to order a concrete mixer but unless you ask for double ingredients,  you also get very little.   Also the flavor of the day seems to be the same month after month of the same flavors.  There are 84 different flavors but you only get the same 30 or 41 flavors all the time.  Our family is extremely disappointed and hope they go back to how they made the custard when they first opened and everything was bursting with ingredients."}
{"text":"First time ever. Not sure if this is how my burger is supposed to be but the patties were flatter than the slice of cheese. They were burnt and looked completely different from the picture. Now I know it's not always going to look like the one in the menu but this is horrible. Will most definitely not come back or recommend anyone to this place. EVERYBODY GO TO IN N OUT THIS PLACE IS A JOKE."}
{"text":"First time ever at a Culver's, or even hearing of one.. Very welcoming staff!.. All the ladies up front were very attentive and took time to come around the counter assisting with suggestions along with some small conversation. Wasn't too hungry so just had a 4 pc chicken tenders which hit the spot, the dessert menu looks great. Staying at the hotel across the way so may have to come back later!"}
{"text":"I've definitely experienced better...IN WISCONSIN!!! We were in town for the Green Bay vs Arizona playoff game and decided to bury our sorrow the Wisconsin way by pigging out at Culver's.  We didn't even know they have one here so were very surprised and excited.  Well, we were quite disappointed.  First of all, vanilla custard is out, WHAT?!?! We got the chocolate one instead and it was all melting and soft, ewww...The burgers themselves were even worse - dry and flat patty, not buttery at all!  Not to mention that they got our orders wrong.  Sigh...Culver's should do a total quality check on this location so their reputation is not ruined."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Culver's when I went in Wisconsin back in 2007. At the time, I had only tried the custard, which is absolutely divine! I went there a few times until I had to return home to Arizona. After a few years of patiently waiting, I found out Culver's was coming to Mesa! I was elated!!! Since then, I have expanded my pallete to their burgers, wraps and sides. I still think the custard is what makes this place special but their other food is good too. I love the fact that they have flavor of the day for custards. Totally amazing place and I would recommend to anyone who likes burgers, fries and custard."}
{"text":"My meaty goodness...why isn't Culvers a nationwide chain?  This bacon cheese burger is way too good to come out of a fastfood drive through window.  I had a nice little picnic on the tailgate of my pickup (driving cross country....long story).  I could not believe how great this burger was. 

The amazing part is the onion rings might be better than the burger.

If you're passing through Wisconsin, you need to stop at Culvers."}

{"text":"We won't be going back, that's for sure! Went in on father's day for 2 concrete mixers and waited 25 minutes before we finally went to see what the problem was. We thought maybe the ice cream machine broke down! But we were told our order just \"dropped out\" of the system (??)! They apologized, then made us wait another 10 minutes for our order. When I asked for a contact number they offered us some coupons. The coupons weren't for any free items, just the ones everyone gets in their junk mail for $1.00 off a meal deal, etc. We never did get any contact info because when we asked, the manager went to \"go get\" the info but never returned!  Thanks, Culver's!.... for the worst customer service I've seen in many many years!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Culver's before. The food is standard Culver's food. I was there late and was really impressed that the employees were so friendly. The place was clean and I did not feel like I was there with a late night crowd.

This is a stand out location."}
{"text":"OMG! I finally got to eat here the other night and i was BLOWWWWWN AWAY! on how amazing this food was! It was INCREDIBLE! the burgers are ridiculously good, the fries are amazing, the staff is great the prices are great! ya definitely CANNNNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"The place looked good from the outside. Yet, as I ordered one of their burgers, I was disappointed. The beef patty was very thin and soggy. The fries were, in addition to sharing the sogginess of the burger, a tad cold. The place was packed though--so, it must have been one of those orders that did not hit the mark. I am not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"The food was good, burgers were great, onion rings were perfect, everyone was happy with what they got but we didn't get everything we ordered unfortunately, hence the 3 rather than 4 star review. Reasonably priced though, we spent about $50 for 5 people... just didn't get one of the burgers we ordered. Tip: if you sign up for their e-club you will get a free meal with purchase of full priced meal (their value meals)."}
{"text":"Well, sometimes you have to try try again, and I did--this time chose the prime beef sandwich and I have to admit, it was yummy, although I DID have to wait a bit, place was quite crowded with mall traffic; TIS THE SEASON!  Fries were not very hot, but probably cause I ate the sandwich first. They seem to be getting their act together and may even give InNOut a run for their money!"}
{"text":"This place has a fun vibe, super friendly staff. I wasn't too hungry so just got some ice cream and my wife (who was starving) got a Swiss melt and fried cheese curds which she was nice enough to share with me. They were crowded but still fast getting our food out to us"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had at a fast food joint!
The meat is so juicy and you could taste the melted cheese in every bite, that is in the Wisconsin Pub Burger. The chicken tenders were good as well with a side of ranch and ketchup. 
I also had the shake. I had the vanilla and you could have 2 toppings blended in, I got the cookie dough and Crunch. It was delish! The only problem is that you can't get any of the toppings through the straw so make sure you get a spoon!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and have been to Culver's a few times. I liked the burgers and onion rings. I went with some co-workers one day when I wasn't in the mood for a burger and tried the fried chicken instead and wasn't very impressed. Next time I'll stick with the burgers.

Now as for the frozen custard, I do enjoy it but it only gets an average rating on my sweet tooth craving scale. Ranks above a candy bar from the vending machine, but below a chocolate chip cookie from Paradise Bakery.

Last time I went in, I appreciated that I could pay for my entire order but wait until after the meal to pick up my frozen custard. But then I got annoyed because after showing my receipt to the lady at the counter she handed me a number and put my order in, then proceeded to stand at the counter at chat with another employee. It's a freaking bowl of frozen custard. How hard is that to dish up?"}
{"text":"Go for the frozen custard and skip the food.  
The food is your standard dinner and ice cream restaurant food.  The deluxe cheeseburger is pretty bland, the fish was very greasy, sitting in a puddle of oil at the bottom of the plate, the chicken tenders were fine, nothing special. 
Prices are a little higher than expected.  And it takes quite awhile to get your food. 
The frozen custard was really good though and the employees are very nice.  
We'll go back for dessert but don't think we'll try the food again."}
{"text":"I always hit Culver's in Wisconsin, then last year we found them in South Bend, IN and now outside Verrado, AZ! Lucky me! Their butter burgers are soooo good, if you have an appetite, order the double! Every day they have a different flavor of frozen custard, let that waistband out! You can also get prepackaged pints to go! Or get a small chocolate shake and dip your fries!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm impressed! Not only did they fulfill my burger craving,but their customer service was excellent! On numerous occasions we had staff stop by our table to make sure we were enjoying our meal. One of them was the Owner, who briefly chatted with us. It says a lot about a business when the owner is willing to get his hands dirty with his employee. 
 
 The burger was delicious! Soft bun, fresh bacon and perfectly cooked crinkle fries. The Rueben Melt was also delicious. I will definitely return and recommend to anyone craving a solid burger."}
{"text":"Always fully staffed to get you through as quickly as possible (although you will likely still wait as they're always packed!). They also do some fundraising for local groups."}
{"text":"Delicious salads, sandwiches, FANTASTIC cheese curds, and desserts. Friendly faces giving great service. Clean, family-friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"My go-to fast food every time I go to the east side of Madison. Culver's mushroom swiss burger is one of my favorite items from the menu, and I can say this particular location makes the best juicy mushroom swiss burger all the time!"}
{"text":"Culvers is pretty cool. I gave them a 4 star because they are a little expensive. They have a menu full of variety from butter burgers to ice cream custard with a colossal amount of toppings! My daughter said the cheese curds taste better than the fried cheese bites at Zaxby's so if you don't know what to get, try those! Happy Culvering, signed undercover fat girl!"}
{"text":"This is really just another McDonald's the food is good but later you will wish you didn't eat it from all the grease.  The real shocker is when you sit down and see huge Bible verses on the wall. I have nothing against religion and people believing in what they want but that is forcing it down peoples throats, Of course you don't have to stay if you don't want to see these giant Bible verses surrounding you but I had already ordered my food and sat down and then saw them. It felt like I was in church ."}
{"text":"My 15yo mentee wanted ice cream and we found this place. It was close by. Didn't really taste like real ice cream. -- just found out it was FROZEN CUSTARD! She was able to add lots of junk to her ice cream and made a mess eating it. So, if you like frozen custard, check it out."}
{"text":"You know if there is a frozen custard place anywhere in driving distance I will find it!  I'm tickled pink to find this one not far from my daughter's house in Mesa, AZ.  I even felt their quality was better than the ones's I had visited in the Mid-west and Texas, though maybe it was just cause I'd missed them.  

Usually you won't catch me suggesting a fast food joint but we went here for lunch today.  I got the Pork Tenderloin sandwich which had a meat pattie way bigger than the bun it was on, perfectly breaded and fried with surprisingly fresh lettuce and tomato on it.  Daughter got a Deluxe Butter Burger with two patties and two slices of cheese.  It was good too.  

She got a Reese's Peanut Butter \"Concrete Mixer\" drink for dessert, which I tasted and liked.  I got a Sundae with a scoop of vanilla frozen custard and Hot Fudge on top and it was so smooth and creamy, just like it should be.  I hope to get back there again before I leave but even if I don't at least I got my fix today!
(4/19/09)

5/1/00
I couldn't resist stopping here on the way to my motel.  I decided to try the \"Walleye Basket\" which was the daily special.  The fish was good and it was a thick piece and the breading was nice and crisp but it was very oily (10pm, end of the day) and the fish had a slight cod liver oil taste so I would probably not order it again.  The mashed potatoes were okay, about on a par with KFC, maybe a little better.  The Daily Flavor of Frozen Custard was M & M Mixins, which turned out to be a chocolate-vanilla mix with M & M mini's in it.  I would have liked it better without the candy.  The frozen custard was delicious as always.  They locked the doors and stopped letting people in before 10pm closing which I thought was not cool, especially after seeing two little boys be disappointed when they found out they couldn't get any frozen custard.  I guess the teenagers thought if they started closing before 10pm they could be out the door at 10.  That's not how the restaurant business works though."}
{"text":"I'm from chicago so i been eating there forever. and its much better and fresher then all other fast food joints, the curds insane, burgers so good and fries are top notch. I'm not a huge fan of there tomatoes all the time but there onions are the best anywhere and have a kick for sure. 
I also love there chicken dinner too but there fish dinner might be the best anywhere around, i would highly recommend giving it a shot if you don't want a burger! i don't like there chicken tenders but i love there spicy chicken tenders, totally dif breading on each and the regular ones don't cut it for me or my kids. the custard if fresh and so good too, kids get free custard with the kids meals too"}
{"text":"Have not even tried anything other than the frozen custard yet, but my family cannot say enough about the butter burgers.  Can't wait to go there again!"}
{"text":"Consistently good fast food burgers, with a bunch of other options... very clean, a bit pricey compared to others..."}
{"text":"Butterburgers are an absolute must. Also, according to my wife (who's gluten intolerant) they have a great gluten free buns!"}
{"text":"I love Culvers custard... But, when you shut the doors at 9:59 pm when a customer is eager to buy an ice cream for their long drive, that's disappointing.  Good thing MacDonalds is across the street. Your loss.."}
{"text":"Culver's is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out. I believe they have several stores now here in the valley. The Root Beer is a must as well as the Butter Burgers, Cheese curds, Frys, Frozen custurd....lol ...the list goes on... I have not found anything as of yet that I did not enjoy."}
{"text":"Their custard is good, just prepare yourself for your order being wrong.  They'll read it back to you right.  It'll come up on the screen right.  But I guarantee you, especially if you order more than one concrete, the mix-ins in at least one of them will be wrong every time you go."}
{"text":"My husband has brought my sons here on their \"man dates\" and they all kept raving about it so I gave it a shot. As much as they raved I assumed this was a sit down restaurant. I was surprised this was \"fast food\"! We got an order of the famous cheese curds and some burgers. The food was all good and for our family of 4 it was about $35. PLUS, the kids all get free frozen custard with their meals. The staff was super friendly and I could definitely see us all coming back. The food didn't seem like fast food quality at all... much better! 

Check in on Yelp and get a free scoop of frozen custard!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Culver's today. The food was excellent and the service was too. The staff was super friendly. Quality was great. Meat was delicious in the burgers. I had the Wisconsin Cheese Curds...DELICIOUS!  Similar to a mozzarella stock, but different in shape, very fresh and perfectly cooked. The frozen custard concrete mix in thing I got was amazing, creamy and full of oreos and peanut butter. So good. My husband got a banana shake, he liked it, but the banana wasn't as ripe as he would have liked. Still a good amount of banana in the shake. The cheesy pub burger I got was super rich. I wish I had ordered a single patty though instead of a double and added lettuce and tomatoes. It was very flavorful and filling. Love all the cheese on it. We're from California and hope to get a Culver's in Cali! Fingers crossed. This place ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Everything was yummy. Husband inhaled his prime rib sandwich. Had no problems at all. Food came out fast. I don't really care for the \"burger\" smell or whatever it is. It's funky."}
{"text":"My first experience with Culver's was absolutely fantastic.  The food was very tasty and the atmosphere was friendly.  The girl (sad to say I forgot her name) demonstrated one of the best customer service experiences I had every had.  I wished I was fortunate to have hired her.  Culver's keep up the great work and give the Culver's Crew a raise for a job well done."}
{"text":"Love there fish fillet . Fresh ,hot and real fish. There fries are the bomb. There wait time is a little longer then 5 mins but it's fresh so you have to wait. Clean eating room with all the staff very happy. Great family eating."}
{"text":"My chicken cashew salad was full of wilted, slimy, brown lettuce, and slimy cucumbers. Unfortunately it was take-out so I didn't see this until I got home. It was absolutely revolting! Apparently everything is \"handcrafted\" which I can't imagine given this salad."}
{"text":"Definitely a great eat here. I only tried Culver's a few months ago for the first time. It's a little bit pricey-er than other burger joints, but this place is worth it. My first experience was at the Paradise Valley location. It was a smaller store. This one is so much bigger and offers more seating. The hospitality and service are exceptional. Everyone smiles and is quite nice. The burgers are a delight! Also serves chicken and roast beef sandwiches. I would compare them to Lenny's Burgers but a little bit more fancy and classy when it comes to presentation. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I think maybe I expected too much from the hype.  In defense of hype there are a lot of folks here from the Midwest and Culver's brings back a piece of their past.  I know there are things that if they showed up here from Santa Barbara I would feel the same way.

Friday lunch the place was packed.  There are 3 registers, all in use and the drive through.  I ordered the $4.99 special (double cheese butter burger, fries and a soft drink) and a 2 scoop custard ($2.69?).  They had not had the software loaded to handle the special so they were not advertising it.  The counter person had to find a manager to explain what the special was and how to handle it then had to come back at the end to key in a code with her card.  I asked for everything except mustard, what I got was mayo and onions.  There was a bottleneck at the soda machine which was dispensing ice at about 3 cubes a minute.  I managed to find a seat and about 8 minutes later my food arrived (you place a number on your table and they find you).  The burger was well done to the point of being crunchy around the edges.  The crinkle cut fries were pretty good. 

My order taker asked if I wanted desert after the meal.  This seemed like a good idea so I agreed.  After I finished my meal I went to go get my desert.  I first had to work backwards through the soda backup then, approaching from the other direction, I had to catch the attention of a server between orders.  This while getting stared down by the 20 or so folks standing in line.  I handed in my slip and was given a new number and went back to my table.  I think I would take my chances on the custard softening if I was to eat there during a lunch or dinner rush again, it adds too much time to a lunch run. 

Strawberry cheesecake frozen custard.  That was the flavor of the day.  It came close to rivaling Cold Stone in overall taste quality and for considerably less money.

All the employees I came in contact with were pleasant and helpful.  The new restaurant is of course spotless.  They could have done better designing with how they handle backups at the soda machine and more than a few folks in line, having he line snake into the eating area creates a bit of a bottle neck.  Quite a few booths and tables, many of which can be reconfigured, inside.  There is a good size misted outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I've had since living in AZ. Absolutely the best seasoned well and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"This location as all are great.The quality is outstanding.Customer service was awesome.I recommend anything and everything.The custard is fantastic and fresh.Get the fried cheese curds they are the best.enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The Butter Burger melts in your mouth, the cheese curds fried to perfection, & the Salted Caramel Cookie Dough concrete mixer tops it off heavenly!!! I am a fan!!!"}
{"text":"Butterburgers. My opiate. Picture a savory, salty, amazing bite of heaven. Everytime that you watch a food show (I mean we're all foodies, right? Otherwise why would we be here?!) and you see the host go into some sort of orgasmic, loss of words mini vacation to paradise, I imagine this would be what they are tasting. This place can't miss. I have had impeccable service, tasty food, and its not expensive like a red robin or something. Ok, its a fast food place, but, its done right.. Or \"culverized\" as they call it. Yummy huge ice cream sandwiches made to look like enormous oreo cookies (although watch the \"best by\" date), flavors of the day... Cement mixers (picture Dairy Queen Blizzards)... I enjoyed some of their more non-traditional food, such as a pot roast sandwich and cheese curds. Yum! And this place is on my drive home from work too. Awesome! You will like it here!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Arizona for 11 years and have heard of Culvers from quite a few friends, all talking about the butter burger and ice cream/frozen custard, so having never been to a Culvers I thought um sounds like a cool little ice cream parlor that I should investigate. 
It's Tuesday night and the kids and I don't feel like cooking and a Culvers just opened up in my area so I told them lets go for burger and shake and they said cool mom!  

Imagine my shock when I walked in to find out that it's a fast food place LOL I don't know why I thought it would be an ice cream parlor. We walked up to the teller and were looking at the menu and placing our order, we were a party of 4 so it took each of us a few minutes to figure out what we want, at this point there was a customer behind us being very rude and loud and complaining about families who go to order but still have to look at the menu board, why can't they just have their order ready. Really lady? lol Some peoples kids I tell ya.

I thought since I am here I am going to try the butterburger cheese, fries and a chocolate shake!  My burger I made a single, I can't eat a double burger, it had cheese, lettuce, pickle and onion, it actually was a great burger, I was surprised. Now when I have a want for In n Out I just might head on over to Culvers. The fries, I like them, they are the crinkled cut fries they were good and the chocolate shake!! Omg soo thick and creamy! DELISH!!

Glad I finally went and checked the place out, the kids, (who are really young adults, age range frm 20 years to 16 years) loved the place too!"}
{"text":"Not very good anymore.  The food was too salty, the green beans were so tough, and the potatoes tasted fake.  Disappointed this time."}
{"text":"I have not been very happy with Culvers for some time now but I had a delicious fish dinner there recently and was very pleased with the quality.   The price was a bit too much I thought for a carry out meal.   For 1.50 you could add three shrimp, which I did and the shrimp was very good and nothing like what I had years ago at a Culver's in Fond du Lac.  The Fond du Lac Culver's shrimp was like biting into a dry loaf of bread.  It was truly awful.   So I have to say that it looks like Culver's has improved some things but their prices are still too high for their fish meals.  I spent about 13 dollars for this meal.   I did save the money that would have been tipped so I guess that is something to consider as a benefit.   If I had gotten this meal at a restaurant and paid 3 dollars less I would have still tipped 4 dollars so it would have cost me a buck more.

Update:  Returned for some of that good fish and shrimp.   still good.  But the shrimp sauce was not so good and the tartar sauce wasn't good either.

Update2:  Have to lower their rating again.   Went back and had some real problems with their food this time.  The fish was greasy this time, something was off with the potatoes, they weren't of the right consistency and sort of thick.  The shrimp had an old grease flavor and were overcooked.  The beans were undercooked and tough.  Unfortunately they have been so \"hit and miss\" we will be switching to a different restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"Went back recently with an open mind and ordered their double butter burger.  The burger looked nice.  The lettuce and tomato were fresh and the bun looked good too.  But the overall flavor was really not very good.  I challenge everyone who things this is a good burger to set aside their preconceived notions about this sandwich and just pay attention to the flavor.   Mine tasted like burnt oil on an overcooked hamburger patty with absolutely zero beef flavor.  I would actually eat a McDonalds quarter pounder with cheese before I would eat one of these \"butter burgers\".
Take a look at the meat, way, way overcooked.

Update:  Went back again and ordered the chicken sandwich.   It was quite dry and flavorless.   The only thing that saved it was that it was hot.

This pretty much does it for me and this business.   They really aren't serving up very good food and I can say that I have had some of the worst meals ever from Culver's versus other restaurants.  It has come to the point where we talk about stopping some place quick and we always opt away from any Culver's.  Until they improve the quality of their food we won't be going back and I expect that will probably be never since they think their food is pretty good.

Update:  Stopped by for a cooler.  Good price, well made and delicious.  Very refreshing.  We don't get any burgers, fish or chicken here anymore but the custard and other treats are always good.  We also noticed that they grounds are immaculate and they have planted at least a hundred or more different plants.   It sure would be nice if other places did such a nice job with their grounds.  They get 5 stars for grounds, 4 stars for dessert and 1 star for food.  I up the review 1 star overall for their work on the grounds and the good desserts."}
{"text":"update:  Culver's has improved in quality and also in service.  This has brought me back.  The fish and shrimp meals are pretty good now.  but the shrimp dip and the tartar sauce is sub-par.   They really need to change these sauces and they need more shrimp sauce for the 10 pc.  One doesn't cut it.
I tried the roast beef dinner the other day.   The beef was good but the bread it was placed on was very tough and pretty basic.  They need to improve the bread or add some carrots to it or something.   I would suggest opting away from the beef roast.
In Verona there is no dinner selection on the drive through board.  I checked twice and could not find it.  They had one dinner item listed in the picture board section.  I find their boards somewhat difficult to navigate as opposed to other drive through restaurants."}
{"text":"Stopped here after work,it was lunch time and i wanted to try something different,anyways i ordered their deluxe burger and i must say i was disappointed,the burger was a good size but it lacked flavoring and the toppings were so ,so.Their fries were good ,thats about it.I do want to try their desserts."}
{"text":"Ice Cream is great employees are efficient and friendly but the
Is a NIGHTMARE! The designer who did this was either drunk
or a complete Bubble Head!"}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday with the after church crowd.Food is very good with the burgers always tasting good.  The fries were hot and crispy and the restaurant was clean.  The diet root beer is great.  Only suggestion is if there are six employees standing behind the counter,  more than one should be taking orders."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Culver's since I was 17 living in Mckinney Tx! I loved their food! I recently moved to AZ and had to try it. Just as I remembered, very fresh juicy burger. the fries are just ok. Besides In n Out this is my second choice for fast food burgers. And lets not get on the amazing custard. best i've ever had."}
{"text":"The burger I had there was tasteless and had a weird texture. The fries were decent and their signature Rootbeer was delicious, but I've definitely had better elsewhere.

In all fairness, I did not try their frozen selection, so I will definitely come back to give them another try."}
{"text":"Was there on a Sunday afternoon, the place was packed!  I ordered a Patty Melt, fries, and a drink.  The burger and fries were ok.  Nothing special.  Then we had to go back for frozen custard.  I have never had frozen custard, ME LIKEY!  It was like a THICK ice cream.  I had snickers with mine.  YUM!  

The employees are very nice."}
{"text":"Met up with a bunch of sweet craving friends.  I got the health concrete mix (small).  It was good and just enough.  My order came out quick.  A couple of folks with us did not get their order until we are almost finished.  They had to bring the plastic number and receipt up to the counter.  They should not have forgotten since there was only a few people in the store."}
{"text":"We got drive thur only.  I did get a peak of the restaurant inside, it is the same set up as all the other Culver's.  I got the Wisconsin Swiss Melt with chili cheese fries & a vanilla shake.  YUM!  I know it is a butter burger, but just wish it was a tad less greasy.  I KNOW, I am at a fast food joint.  The vanilla frozen custard shake is goodness and the chili cheese fries were pretty good.  Their menu looks massive from the outside looking in, the drive thur menu I don't think captures it all.  I guess we need to stop in sometime soon."}
{"text":"Driving through and wanted to try someplace new ... 

I have never heard of Culver's, but saw the parking lot and drive-thru were packed.  Figured I would give it a shot.

The burgers are huge, plenty of flavor, and lots of toppings.
The cheese bites are amazing.
The onion rings are almost as good as the cheese bites (I am a fan of cheese, so kinda partial here to the bites).
The chicken tenders are good, I suggest the Buffalo tenders dipped in ranch with Frank's Red Hot - so good!

The have a killer diet root beer ... I know what you are thinking, I just loaded up my heart with fried foods only to get a diet root beer - don't judge me (LOL).

Look forward to returning, suggest anyone check it out."}
{"text":"after seeing them building it for months and reading the menu on their national website we were somewhat intrigued.  from appearances it reminded me of a similar place in the peoria/glendale area http://www.freddysfrozencustard.com/  which seems to adopt the chicago theme.  I found similar offerings at Culvers with the thin steak-burger style stacked burgers, which they call butterburgers, as well as frozen custard served ala DQ blizzard style which were similarly called concrete mixers.

I ordered a double mushroom swiss butterburger with cheese curds and a concrete mixer.  I found it interesting that they ask you what condiments you want on every sandwich.  I'm so used to just having the blanks penciled in for me that I was like a dear in headlights.  The food was pretty good, the burger was juicy and satisfying.  the cheese curds were good, I've had better at some bars but not bad for fast food. the custard was good but didn't seem quite on par with some of the other places that offer custard in the area.

all in all, it was a satisfying meal, and I would go back"}
{"text":"Super new location that opened at the beginning of the year I believe, next to the 99 Cents Only store and Walmart. We joked on the way in that this experience was either going to be really bad or really good because it was so new. Of course if you have been to a Culver's, the inside was the same as any location: plenty of family style seating and booths. Everything came out hot and was fresh. The hamburgers are always pounded thin, it's actually real beef, and the cheese is amazing. The fries are crinkle cut and they taste fresh. 

The only thing I have ever eaten at Culver's that I was disappointed by was the mashed potatoes and gravy, the gravy was on the flavorless side. Other than that, everything is GOOD here. Those concrete mixers will get you into trouble, they are so good but so many calories. The diet root beer tastes like regular. If you've ever had root beer from a keg, that's what it tasted like.  Even though it is fast food, they actually bring your food to your table and ask if you need anything else."}
{"text":"When we lived near Great Lakes by Wisconsin, this store was it. Nothing's changed! Stopped by here enroute to Yuma, and yeah glad we did. The food's always great, the employees helpful and happy but the deserts what always brings it home for us. Military discount, I think. Had a great time, going again."}
{"text":"What's enough to make someone take the off-ramp at high speeds? Why Culvers, of course!!

  The lobby, clean. The staff, friendly and accommodating. The food, great! Used my military discount for a family of 5....I ordered the Butter Burger meal with the works...delicious. The fries were 4 out of 5; good, but kunda not tasty. The desert was great.

   Off the beaten path, it was worth following the signs from the highway to the store. Worth it...again, I say!"}
{"text":"We usually have an enjoyable time when we come through a Culver's.

 At this particular one, we went through the drive thru but had to go inside twice because they kept forgetting things on our order. 

  However, they had a decent attitude replacing our missing items sooo...no harm, no foul. And that deserves 4 stars instead of 3."}
{"text":"This location is busy. A huge group came in and it took forever to order my food. Not enough people working front  counter or preparing the food. The line was almost out the door. I didn't see a manager working or trying to help the staff. 


Yes the food is good and they do not make it until you order it which is awesome. I had my order to go and I didn't realize my order was wrong until after I left. I couldn't go back since I had already waited over 13 minutes just to get my food and I was running behind. (The drive thru was backed up too) The person who took my order was very nice and professional. He wasn't stressed out because of all of the orders. I was just a little disappointed the person who arranges the food orders didn't check the ticket correctly before delivering the food."}
{"text":"As always, great food. The kids meals are reasonable and very filling for the little ones. They are under $6 and they come with a drink and custard. Each meal came with a token. Once you get 10 tokens, you get a free kids meal. Check it out."}
{"text":"I love this place and the food, always come here when I visit the Charlotte area, the burgers are great, and the fries and shakes are great as well. The staff always so friendly, This place is must try would give it more stars  if I could!"}
{"text":"Would've given Culver's 5 stars, but I ordered a banana split with 2 scoops and when they brought it out, the ice cream was already completely melted. Please don't wait to bring out ice cream guys.

The burgers + cheese curds are dreamy though."}
{"text":"Been to this location about 4 or 5 times, mostly the drive thru. Always good service, friendly. Last night the yound man who brought my order out was definately younger. He was so polite, so friendly. Great smile, very confident and outgoing. It was so great to see a young man with great qualities!"}
{"text":"It's Culvers, what else can I say. 
I love the place. Best fast food for the price.

This particular Culver's is getting a review because of how great it is. There is something about this location that stands above the rest and I can not put my finger on it. better tasting food, better frozen yogurt, better specials every day...I just don't know. It is just great.

I have to also add in that this location is always busy. Always busy! Cars coming onto the road busy, so this must mean I'm not the only person that thinks this Culver's location is extremely awesome."}
{"text":"Burgers are not too bad, nothing great but somewhat unique w/ the buttered bun. Five Guys is better. HOWEVER: If you are craving a classic rueben, I don't know how they pulled it off, but it is phenomenal. The bread could be a little thicker but I give this fast food spawned reuben a freaking 9.5 out of ten. I was shocked. I had one yesterday and went back today. It's also not huge (but only 588 calories) but it is filling. Go try one because I know you think I am crazy but it's unreal. Chompies is the only one better in town. This reuben is second. note: ADD MUSTARD or you are missing out on a flavor extravaganza."}
{"text":"CULVERS is the best! They have the freshest fast food around. The custard and other treats are delish. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered a double cheese burger meal. The cheeseburger was good and tasty . I would come back again."}
{"text":"Finally tried Culver's. Never again. So disgusting. The concrete taste exactly like McDonalds. So gross. Even the ketchup was nasty. How do you screw up ketchup?"}
{"text":"OK, I'll admit it, I get my once a week Culver's fix.  Usually the delux double w/fries....can you say good times.  I've done the chicken sandwich once and was not impressed so I'd stick with a burger which is very addictive.  Ever since Culver's opened, I have not set foot in a Wendys for their double.  Reminds me of grilled goodness from the midwest.  Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to try this place out and it was great.
I ordered a few things to try out.
Grilled Reuben melt without coleslaw.
Beef pot roast sandwich with gravy on the side. (Added a lot)
Chicken tenders and also the ButterBurger Cheese with only ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise and pickles.
I was surprised it was all great...
For dessert ordered a mint chocolate chip shake and a pumpkin spice Shake. The Pumpkin Spice wasn't really good So ended up trading it out for a vanilla Reese's and brownie bits it was a lot better.. :)
The Customer service was excellent here...
The Best service we ever had anywhere for a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I understand that things happen (go wrong). It's when you argue with me about what was ordered vs. what was delivered to the table that bugs me. Uncool."}
{"text":"The food is really good but too expensive for what you get.  the employees are very nice and they do have very good service. After lunch I ordered a vanilla custard with Oreos and hot fudge. I had a hard time finding the hot fudge!!! No exaggeration!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Wisconsin, the birthplace of Culver's. Most of the outlets are in the Midwest. So imagine my surprise as I was driving from Ft. Lauderdale to West Virginia, to see a Culver's sign at the exit in Rock Hill, SC. This is like manna from Heaven. Culver's may be the best fast food hamburgers in America; or should I say \"Butter Burgers!\" Yes, they are topped with a pat of butter which melts lusciously over the beef patty and bun, giving it a wonderful richness! The fries are done perfectly, too! Save room for some great ice cream desserts! By the way when we stopped, my doggie even ate a butter burger! She LOVED it!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Custard is great. The drive through does take a while but I feel like because they make everything fresh so it not too bad for the wait. They also have sweet tea that is very good, it's not too sweet so it's just right."}
{"text":"The staff is sweet, but the service is horrendous. After waiting 20+ minutes for a take out order I got home to realize both my sandwich AND ice cream were incorrect. Not to mention during the time I was waiting I saw several other customers complaining and the staff was running around like chicken's with their head cut off. No one seemed to have a clue what they were doing. The only thing that stopped me from complaining was that I was truly embarrassed for them. This is the second time in a row I've been disappointed with incorrect orders at this location. The next closest Culver's is quite a drive, but may be worth it to avoid the pure chaos."}
{"text":"Very good burger and cheese curds.  The ice cream/custard is the main attraction for me, however.  It is just awesome."}
{"text":"After placing my order through the drive thru, I had to re-place the order at the window as they had it all incorrect. I had to pull forward to wait for the order and after about a 5 minute wait, was told they were out of an item for the order. I then had to continue to wait while watching other customers leave with their orders. To top everything off, the order was wrong when we received it!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. It was my first time at a Culver's and I am now coverted to custard for life."}
{"text":"No place better for a family dinner!

I can home after an 8 month hiatus from AZ. The first I visited was Culver's with my family. The super friendly staff made us feel very welcomed. The food was super cheap and absolutely delicious! Pro tip - order a kids meal. You get a good portion of food, drink, and ice cream for under 6 bucks!!!"}
{"text":"We had just learned about Culver's for fastfood and the food did not disappoint.  We each had the single butter burger with cheese,  chesse curds, onion rings and sweet potato fries.   It was all very good. The burgers tasted fresh.   The onion rings were my wifes fav, the sweet potato fries were my fav and the boys loved the cheese curds.   Would recommend this place definitely."}
{"text":"The employees at this location are the losers in life who never finished college because they were too busy trying to figure out when they were going to get stoned again next.  Now they are out in the working world and things haven't changed much.  Except, instead of talking during lecture about the next great party, they are doing it behind the registers at this Culver's."}
{"text":"Went to get a treat instead of going to DQ drove the extra miles to Culver's sat at drive thru speaker for almost 5 minutes no one was ahead of me nothing girl came on and was laughing not listening to my order got up to window paid no receipt given asked still nothing she was to busy chatting with co workers and closed window quick finally got just concrete mixers no food and had to ask again for a carrier and receipt then girl disappeared and a nice young man helped me but still no receipt very unhappy"}
{"text":"One word. Custard! For those who don't know, custard is soft serve ice cream with eggs mixed in. Makes for a creamier yummy taste! They make \"concrete mixers\" which are basically like a blizzard from DQ. They have many flavors. Sundaes. Shakes. They got it all. 

I've been to this location a handful of times, and always has good service, food made to order - coming out hot & yummy. I don't eat out a lot, and rarely \"fast food\" but this is a pretty good cheap burger and fries! *they have crinkle cut fries by the way, and they are the bomb dot com* (I love fries) 

They are known for this custard, burger & fries. But they also have chicken tenders, salads, fish, and soups! I like that they offer side items such as fries, cheese bites, soup, salad, etc. with their combos at no additional charge. So say you want to swap fries for a salad. No problem! 

Kid friendly menu, $4.99 includes entree/side/ drink (fountain, chocolate or white milk, juice box)/a scoop of custard with topping which you can use right then and there or wait til another time. Also \"scoopie token\" it's on the side of kids meal bag. You collect 10 and get to choose a Culvers football, soccer ball, volleyball or \"stuffed animal\" ice cream cone. I like this better than a wack little toy in each like some places (the yummy custard and choosing a sport related item eventually)"}
{"text":"Its from Wisconsin baby! of course its good!!! ice cream, burgers & root beer. Every once in a while I'm feeling Culver's so I'm glad they made it to town"}
{"text":"Get the concrete mixer, you'll love it!

Other than that, it's fast food."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service, I have a large family and three times that I've gone for drive thru take out my order hasn't come out complete like I ordered. I even have them repeat themselves but that seems to confuse them more.. They don't mind taking the money for the food but can't get an order right. I have given them several chances, spoke to the manager and only thing they replied with was \"we're still new\" unprofessional and horrible service. Only giving one star because it's a requirement otherwise they wouldn't receive one on my behalf"}
{"text":"Was here for a late night snack. Place buzzed with liveliness. The staff were very helpful. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. Wish they had them in the East Coast."}
{"text":"The good:  Customer service here is awesome.  There was quite a line in the drive thru, but when we popped inside, there was literally no line to order our food, just a handful of people waiting for their food.  The girl who took our order was friendly and fast, and the few people I asked for more things from were the same.  They even agreed to split the mini dessert into two bowls for us!  Really nice people here!

We didn't enjoy the food.  We shared the spicy chicken sandwich, which I thought was good but my husband declared to be the worst chicken sandwich he's ever had.  The onion rings were flavorless and the fried cheese curds were not a hit with us.  The blizzard-like dessert (\"concrete mixer\") is just your standard soft serve with the usual mix in options; maybe it's a little creamier, and if you like DQ you'd probably like this, but it was very basic to us.  It is really nice getting to choose two mixins though!  Bottom line:  this isn't very good, even for fast food.

It's kinda expensive for fast food.  The chicken sandwich combo came with a large drink and we paid $1 extra to upgrade to onion rings and 80 cents to upgrade to XL drink; that one combo plus the regular sized cheese curds and a mini sized dessert was $18.  We would not return, but then again we don't usually eat fast food, so your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. One of the managers, Niqui always has a smile on her face."}
{"text":"When I step into a fast food restaurant, I prefer not to be greeted with bible quotes adorning the walls and Fox News blaring on multiple televisions.  I feel like 75% of every dollar I spend at Culver's goes directly to the RNC.  With that said, the ButterBurger is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a week and have ordered everything on the menu pretty much... it's all wonderful. The service is great and hardly have to wait. I also love getting the new texts for coupons once a week for an item from here."}
{"text":"Such great food and service!

Came in here for my first visit today and was completely taken care of by the men and women behind the counter. Boyfriend and I ordered two Culver's bacon deluxes with cheese curds and French fries. The cheese curds were great! And I'm loving their root beer. We are definitely full (and happy) after.

We're driving back to LA now and the staff (Bree!! she's wonderful!) actually packed our little cooler with ice so we could take some Culver's frozen custard back with us and share. New spring training tradition!!

Thank you, Bree and the entire crew at the North Avondale Blvd location for taking care of us. We appreciate your kindness, excellent service, and yummy food! You made sure we didn't feel like a number, and we'll be coming back for sure!"}

{"text":"Excellent burgers, fries and desert along with other menu items (including salads, fish, chicken items).  Coupons frequently available in the weekly AZ Rep newspaper."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan of burgers, or maybe my expectations were just too high... The burger I had here was good, the chicken sandwich was pretty good too. The frozen custard... well.. I've never had frozen custard before, so maybe it was the best, but I didn't think it was any better than an original dairy queen soft serve. The service is rude, in my opinion. It was my first time and they asked what I wanted, so of course, to be easy I say \"however it comes\" and the response was in a better-than-you, teenage burger snob tone: \"well, they COME plain, so you want it plain?\" ummm... no. \"okay, then I'll take everything\" \"so you want pickles?\" \"yes\" \"mustard and ketchup\" \"yes\" well, if I wanted to do it that way I would have asked you to name off the ingredients... The fries were great and the chili fries were really great, but they still don't hold a candle to my childhood fave- Weinerschnitzels chili fries.. mmm...."}
{"text":"This is a Wisconsin based chain with a great reputation for tasty burgers and creamy ice cream. This location is right next to inexpensive South Carolina has from Marathon/Kangaroo and Exxon. It is also just outside Carowinds which makes it a great place to meet before or after a day at the park. Finally, the new Cabelas is close by. A trip to this spot has many rewards."}
{"text":"We made this a last stop before I was dropped off at the airport.  My friend had been raving about this frozen 'custard' dessert right from the beginning of our 13 hour road trip to AZ.  She's originally from Wisconsin so she was all about Culver's.  Not knowing what to expect, I literally pictured the dessert as an actual custard, that after baking, it was frozen and somehow you have to dig into it with a fork and knife.  Not only was that a false image, but I was surprised that Culver's was a fast food chain restaurant....all along I thought it was just a dessert spot.  Nonetheless, we came here only for one thing- the frozen custard.  Flavor of the day: butter brickle (blended butter pecan enhanced with chewy chunks of Heath Bar); smooth and creamy, the texture in between gelato and ice cream.  I didn't even want to know how many calories was in a small serving...after all, I was on vacation and had the right to splurge. 

I don't think I'd come back for the frozen custard...I'd rather spend my calorie intake on gelato, ice cream, or frozen yogurt. But hey, at least now I can say that I've had frozen custards before!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The custard is beyond repair. I tried ordering 5 different flavors that they say they offer online. They offer NONE besides the 'flavor of the day' which by the way the last two times I ordered looked like melted soup custard. Looks nothing like the photo, in fact the double Oreo marshmallow looked like a chocolate shake with nothing in it. The photo shows huge pieces of Oreos. If you're looking for ice cream stick with sonic, cold stone, DQ, the grocery store...ANYTHING BUT CULVERS!!!"}
{"text":"Great reminder of home and the Wisconsin custard!"}
{"text":"I stopped here on the way to my hometown from the airport one of the last times I was in the Madison area. I'm normally a huge fan of the Wisconsin Swiss Melt, but the one I had here was not so good.

First, the sandwich was exceptionally greasy. I don't think I've ever had a patty melt-type sandwich that was that greasy in my life. Yeah, I understand this is a joint that specializes in butter burgers, but this was extreme, even for Culver's.

Second, the size of the burger was pathetic. Admittedly, I've been out of Wisconsin for a few years now, so maybe my recollection of the size of Culver's burgers isn't so good, but the patty on this particular sandwich was seriously thin, and the burger came no where close to covering the bread.

If you're just passing through the north side of Madison and have a sudden craving for Culver's, I'd suggest you keep going and stop at the location in Waunakee or the location near East Towne Mall, depending upon which direction you're heading."}
{"text":"This 5 star review is based on the custard I got. You get to pick 2 flavors to go with your custard. I picked salted caramel and the Oreo. It tasted like McFlurry from McDonald but 2x better. Why? Because it has a lot more Oreo than McDonald and it's pretty even out from top to bottom. I definitely recommend coming here if you want a delicious custard!"}
{"text":"They call it a BUTTER burger for a reason..... YUP! It melts in your mouth like butter, lol! The burger was good, but I was torn between the party in my mouth & my terrified arteries crying. This burger is a good splurge. It's on my list of things to eat when I've been really good,,, or really bad, lol! 

The location is nice. There are bible verses/quotes all over the walls, which took me a bit by surprise. I'm not saying it's good or bad, I'm just mentioning it because it's not something that usually comes with fast food :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers done anyway you like. Great selection of sides, the onion rings and crinkle cut fries are perfect, however you can also get deep fried cheese curds.  They serve salad or mashed potatoes and gravy for a side as well.  Butter Burgers are fresh and you can tell the difference.  The frozen custard is thick and creamy.  Just plain delicious.  My only problem, is that this location is adjacent to my hotel, which means that I can walk there and back!  Too tempting :)"}
{"text":"It's past 10p on a weeknight and I'm hungry and pregnant! I wanted something quick and close. I've never eaten at Culver's before - why? Because they are a fast food joint and I don't expect the food to be good. However, I thought anything tasted good at this point so I'll try it... boy, do I regret it.

I ordered the Swiss mushroom burger and cheese curds. They were both so awful! The burger tasted old, soggy, greasy and tasteless. The cheese curds tasted like it was in the fryer way too long. I probably had three bites and I threw the rest away. Ugh, thanks Culver's for confirming that I was right. Your food isn't good. Sorry."}
{"text":"Is walking distance from Brakes Plus so I thought I'd try it. I got a cashew grilled chicken salad with honey mustard dressing. The salad was ok. Not a lot of lettuce. Salad was very small for the price you pay. Grilled Chicken was very good. Than I got a caramel shake. I should have just gotten the shake. Still will try this restaurant again. Not bad."}
{"text":"We live right down the road from this new Culver's, which isn't good for my waistline, but we can't help but go there often. They are consistently good. The drive thru moves quickly, the food is hot and tasty, and the staff is friendly. We are always pleased with our experience.  

Also, they have Veggie burgers!!  Not sure why it's not on the menu, but if you order one they will make it for you (I actually emailed them to complain about lack of vegetarian options, and was told they have veggie burgers. Dunno why they are keeping it a big secret). It's yummy, and comes standard with pickles, onion, tomato, lettuce, and mayo (I personally skip the mayo and pickles). The cheese curds are also a delicious mix of white and yellow cheddar which is a nice change from the norm. 

For a quick meal they don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Pretty much a mixed bag.  I'm a newbie to the area but so far, they have the best frozen dessert option ever. The custard is amazing!  Great flavor, and a very smooth texture.  The Butter Burger has actually replaced Five Guys as my favorite fast/casual burger.  The cheese curds are quite possibly the best in the business and the fries are always cooked perfectly.  But with all of that good comes some bad.  The fish is overpriced and just ok, I expect amazing when I'm paying $12+ for fast food fried fish. I'd pay $7 for it any day but never again at $12.   The chicken tenders were possibly the worse chicken tenders I've ever had.  Greasy, small, and not whole chicken . . .  more like a bigger nugget.  I ate one and threw the rest away."}
{"text":"The deluxe was a very nice steakburger, even if it had too much lettuce. The Wisconsin pub burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had. It's cheeses and seasonings produced this salty, garlic flavor that I've never tasted in a burger before. It was phenomenal!
The crinkle fries were crispy and delicious, and the onion rings were well battered and fried. Further, the cheese curds had a fantastic, crunchy batter that was well spiced. 
Finally, the root beer (caffeine-free, I had the diet) was delicious, sweet and smooth :)"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good food, if you're after a fresh burger, fries, cheese, and the like. The Concrete mixers (think blizzard with custard) are to die for. This place puts DQ or any other fast food place to shame. I love going here for my 'cheat meal' once a week...or sometimes twice :)"}
{"text":"OMG!  I had the caramel cashew frozen custard!  I would give up Fenton's black and tan for this. Yes, you heard me right!  The cashews are bit salted so you get that salt and sweet taste.  This past weekend I went to the a place that served frozen custard in Willow Glen and it didn't EVEN come close.    

*Chicken cashew salad - grilled to order chicken, sugar snap peas, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, iceberg lettuce and spring greens.  This THE best fast food salad I ever had.

*Fish and chips - It's the BEST fish and chips I every had - even compared to a restaurant!  The batter wasn't thick.  It was light and crispy and not oily.  The fish was soooo juicy and moist.  It wasn't fishy at all.  

Tried the Culver's in Phoenix and it wasn't as nearly as good.

I can't wait until I go to back !!!!"}
{"text":"Been here before and was disappointed by the sundae we got, it was very small and maybe only had 1 cookie in the whole thing. We tried it again today to have lunch and was pleasantly surprised at how well they do burgers and sandwiches. Their cheese curds were really tasty as well and the malt had decent malt flavor. This has changed our initial idea of the restaurant. I would still go somewhere else for a sundae though."}
{"text":"Very good burgers and shakes. I would love to eat here a lot but it's a little too fattening...good to have every once in a while"}
{"text":"\"Fast food gourmet. Says the girl on a cooking strike. My attempts at eating better without cooking~ no fault of theirs. Food was ok. I threw away both breads on the . Not being a teen anymore my body simply cannot tolerate FF anymore"}
{"text":"We got concretes: salted Carmel with cashews, and Andes mints with cookie dough. The Carmel was all at the bottom of the cup, but that wasn't a big deal. The service was alright. We decided we prefer Nielson's frozen custard, but Culver's still tasted good. 

I would choose different paintings to decorate their restaurant, personally."}
{"text":"Went late to get takeout and to try the fish sandwiches I saw on TV and a burger for my wife.
Fish was terrible-oily, lumpy and cold!
And they forgot the burger! I called from home and they said it was ONLY the burger they forgot!!!
Never again..."}
{"text":"It looks like a fun place, but it's really just average fast food. I had a chicken sandwich and a side salad and a small drink and it was over $8.00. I guess the people seemed friendly enough. I probably won't return anytime soon, since I think most every other fast food restaurant is better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible drive-through service.I ordered a Vanilla Ice Cream in a cup.My daughter-in-law ordered food and drinks.The server brought me a small cup of what could not have been more than 2 tablespoons of ice cream when she brought the drinks.She didn't even put the ice cream in a bag.It melted before the food came .Lousy service.Very thoughtless."}
{"text":"I was in Wisconsin for the first time and told I had to go to culvers. The drive thru line was insanely long so I went in, ordered and got my food quickly. The butter burger was one of the best fast food burgers I've had, fries were great and the root beer was delish. I also got the frozen custard flavor of the day: strawberry chocolate marshmallow. It was creamy and delicious. Wish there was a location near me so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"Been to this place probably too many times.  But, they have nice courteous kids working in there and the food is reliably good.  My kids love it too.  Yes, sometimes there is a wait but they make your food fresh instead of pulling it out from under a lamp and tossing it in a bag."}
{"text":"I have had the fortune of experiencing In-n-Out Burger, which is as divine as everybody makes it out to be. Unfortunately, they only exist in California. Culver's is, in my opinion, the next best thing. Their burgers are succulent, and you can tell the quality of the beef. The prices are not bad, and the fries are crispy, fresh, and not overly greasy. Even better, their menu has a wide variety of choices. When I was living in San Francisco, going to In-n-Out was a common, easy choice when I wasn't feeling up to anything fancy. Now that I'm in Madison, I'll be going to Culver's for that."}
{"text":"I despise this place. Cheese curds are disgusting. 
I think this is literally the only place that has ever made me fear that I was going to go into cardiac arrest after leaving. 
I haven't tried the custard, which is supposedly what they are best known for, so I can't rate it on that level, but the food is really gross."}
{"text":"Food is good quality, but a bit pricey for the experience and portion size.  The staff is over-the-top friendly, which is usually nice to see.  We'll see how they do after it's been open several months. I really love the cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Best. Onion. Rings. Ever... EVER!!! 

If I ever get put on death row, my last meal will be a hubcap full of Culver's onion rings. They are just absolutely perfect - light, crispy beer-style batter on thick, hearty slices of sweet onion served piping hot and in large doses. 

Oh yeah, they have butter burgers too, which are good and greasy, blah blah blah, but the onion rings are to diiiiieee.... which is precisely why I am not allowed near this chain now. My butt is still mad at me for the last batch..."}
{"text":"This my first time here and I will be back very nice employees and food was tasty I would recommend coming here"}
{"text":"Went to the Culver's on Camelback drive-through on Thursday May 15th (temps were high so thought it'd be refreshing to eat a scoop of custard in a cookie cone. I was handed the cone and as I was driving forward, I noticed that half the cone side was broken and leaking custard. It was a ness. The woman who handed me the cone didn't provide any napkins. I stopped my car and went into the restaurant and they gave me a cup for the mess."}
{"text":"They are doing something right because they are consistently busy for lunch M-F when I am most often here. Sometimes the only parking available has been in the street & the drive through is always backed up regardless of the hour. 

But I always come back because they do a good job for me always getting my butter burger no cheese with the works plus a tomato correct.  Dining room is always clean staff seems on point.

My only complaint which is of no fault of Culver's is the fact there is no left turn arrow on Cottage Grove Road going west onto Lumberman's Trail making getting into Culver's from the east very difficult due to a lot of on coming traffic.  Hopefully in time this will be rectified."}
{"text":"Stopped in on their 3rd day of business and they were running like a well-oiled machine!

The drive thru was backed up nearly to the road like every other Culver's in the surrounding area.  We ate in the restaurant so I can only assume they were pumping those cars through as quickly and efficiently as they could.

Inside, a young man named Mason took our order.  It took him a little bit to punch in our order and supervisor Nicholas was right there to help him out without \"taking over\".  Mason handled our order expertly including hubby's green bean substitution on his basket order.

The dining room was clean and new of course and it was a pleasure to be seated there while we waited for our food.  Our food was delivered with a smile and we were asked if we needed anything else.

Food was as expected compared to any other Culver's we've eaten at.  I just got a cup of chili tonight while hubby got his pot roast sandwich with green beans.  No custard tonight so someone else will have to take the lead on that one.

We don't live in Cottage Grove but I am so pleased to see Culver's finally moving in there giving the residents more food options and the teenagers a close place to work.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night and got their Atlantic Cod dinner. It was good but the fish was on the drier side and french fries came out cold. Service was nice and quick. Place was also clean as well, no trash on the floor."}
{"text":"Drive through moves at a slow pace, but that's to be expected since none of their food is frozen (except the custard!) inside is kept up nicely, bathrooms are clean. Staff is very friendly, and sometimes gives four-legged friends a milk-bone if they are in the backseat during the drive through!"}
{"text":"Visit 2: The operator got my concerns submitted via Culvers.com and called to rectify the situation by offering replacement items.

IF you decide to go here you need to explain to people what you want and how to get it done. It's like they've had no product or procedures training. They don't understand sizes are different. The cashier tonight told everyone everything comes in the same three sized cups that are out front on the counter (wrong). One of our sundaes was made with the wrong custard. We said nothing this time. They don't know about the \"custard later\" option or receipts so you can retrieve it. Dining room was dirty. The thought that seats must be clean and not just table tops eluded people. We had to ask for seats to be cleaned.

Go here if desperate for the food but be prepared to act as a trainer because they don't quite have it figured out and I hope they do before a corporate person comes in!

Visit 1: Waited over 5 minutes at the window for 3 scoops of custard. 2 of which were plain, 1 a mixer. Cups have literally one evened out scoop of custard for nearly $3/each. Custard doesn't even fill the bottom of the bottom of the cup, much less the bottom bowl part. Having association with another Culver's in then past, I can tell you these are way under filled per what the corporate directive is. Remember this is a franchise and things should be the same no matter what shop you stop at. Weight won't even register on a scale. The mixer has two pieces of cookie dough.

They do not answer the phone so you can't seek remedy once you notice the issues later! 

There are many Culver's. Avoid this one."}
{"text":"Bathrooms and the soda station area always dirty but the people are working hard, friendly, and efficient. Food has always been made right and fresh."}
{"text":"Can't really add to what others have already said.  I've been to the DV Culvers twice now, both at lunch time, once on a weekday, once on a weekend.  Both times, restaurant was super busy, and the seating was a little cramped.  But, we made it through both.  Food was delivered fast and fresh.  I _really_ like the butter burger!  Way better then the big three (McD, BK or W's)  The shake was thick and tasty, and the crinkle cut fries were crispy and hot.  GF got the rings, which were also better then most.  I'm not sure how often I'll be able to return, as neither location is anywhere close to where I live or work.  But when I find myself at DV and the I17, and hungry, I know where I'm going...

4 stars, cause, well, it is still a chain, after all."}
{"text":"Better than your average burger. It's worth it to go just for the burgers. Then add either the homemade rootbeer or frozen custard and you have 2 or 3 times as many reasons to go. The custard is awesome! The rootbeer is really good-somewhere between the sharpness of Barq's and the sweetness of A&W-a really pleasant compromise. My favorite custard it's caramel with strawberries. Give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We love the frozen custard. Especially after taking a walk. Feels like a well deserved treat. The staff here is always so friendly."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty yummy, but I come here for the delicious chocolate custard! YUM!"}
{"text":"Not impressed... Portions are smaller, bread greasy not toasted, bacon flavorless, burger looked sad overall"}
{"text":"I don't really think this place is worth all the hype. I've known of its existence for some time so finally decided to stop in and try it. Don't get me wrong, the custard was good, but the burger I ordered was dry and pretty plain. My friend ordered the cod sandwich and wasn't impressed either. So if you're in the mood for custard or a shake, this is the place for you. If you're looking for good food, I would advise you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have seen this place many times but never thought of actually eating there, it's not exactly in the best of places but after my new neighbor told me how good the burgers are I had to venture in.  I usually don't judge a place by its appearance,  trust me I have eaten in some crazy looking joints, the best was in East New York, Brooklyn,  best rotisserie chicken ever was served out of a place that looked like a dumpster with a window but anyway,  the menu had me in awe, it was quite big with anything you could imagine from shrimp to chicken to burgers, chili, salads and really good ice cream shakes.  I ordered the butter burger double with bacon, it was delicious,  fries are good and also are the onion rings.  Cheese curds are also very tasty as well, all in all a great fast food place with excellent service,  the woman at the register was very nice and explained the menu to us without trying to rush us off the line even though it was crowded.   I have been there twice now in the last week.  Burgers are fresh not frozen.  My next time I will be trying the pot roast sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here and it smells in here. A sour, unpleasant smell. The table is filthy and after repeatedly attempting to place a custard order we were still brought the wrong order. Not into it. Back to Zoyo for us! Here was the ordering experience:

Me: I'd like one scoop of the flavor of the day and one scoop of vanilla in a dish. 
Seriously a tough concept for the guy taking my order. My husband ordered 2scoops of chocolate . I finally gave up and ordered two scoops of vanilla. The dude shows up with one scoop dishes. Honestly I think this place is going downhill. Clean your grease traps before you have a fire. I think the smell in here is grease. We were given coupons so we can come back for more lousy service. No thanks."}
{"text":"The only item I didn't like was the hamburger beef patties which I thought were too dry. I think that is a huge deal considering you are known for your signature burgers. 
I wish I knew a place where they served good cheeseburgers plus sides together."}
{"text":"Glad to have Culver's in AZ! Food a bit pricey so I Love the kid's meal cheeseburger with a free scoop of custard! Cheeses curds are great! Favorite quick service restaurant."}
{"text":"Price was pretty high for a burger, fries and a drink. $8.00 and some change. The burger was good but I'm a big guy, thinking this is a snack for me. I can't see a family of 4 going there for less then $25.00 for lunch."}
{"text":"Deer Valley rock's..Been to the Gilbert store. They need some work"}
{"text":"The drive thru today was a poor example of what customer service should or should not be. The lady at the drive-through, Morgan, had less than stellar attitude. Tried to call and talk to a manager who did at least apologize for the problem but that did not let me finish speaking to her before she said have a nice day and hung up. There are such better ways to handle customer service issues. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised when I took a shot in the dark by asking if they serve a veggie burger patty. I didn't notice it on the menu. They came through and all the fixings (pickle, onion, tomato, lettuce, and mayo) are standard. Put together a meal with fries and a drink under $8. Will go again next time scheduling calls for last minute drive thru."}
{"text":"I LOVE CULVERS. True Wisconsin food with lots of fat, so if you're on a diet save this for your cheat day. Convinced that I'll have Culver's cater my wedding."}
{"text":"Just because i received a great customer service, i won't put my star down to you all. Even though waited for 30 minutes for my fried chicken, i am ok with it. Food was great and just need to pay attention to detail. And I am late to pick up my bro-in law. Is ok just being positive person. They offered me a concrete custard, but I am not a person who will take advantage about it. Thanks CULVER'S"}
{"text":"Typical Culvers- great food and clean. I have been here several times. I do notice that the staff at the particular Culvers is not as friendly and welcoming as your typical Culver's."}
{"text":"Delicious food for a great value! I got the Culver's Burger combo, which came with a drink, crinkle cut fries, and burger (which you can get with one or two patties, but I went with one). The total cost for all of this was about $7. (Not bad!) While I was here, I decided to try the Oreo concrete mixer and it was awesome! It is basically vanilla custard with crushed Oreos, which is similar to what you might get at a Goodberry's (back in my home state of NC). The restaurant itself (including the bathroom) was very clean and had an overall pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome! Food was excellent. I got the Culver's Deluxe and it exceeded my expectations. Even the fries were above average. They didn't have that generic taste that a lot of fast food places have. Just be prepared to pay a little more than you would at other similar places like In-and-out or Jack in the Box. We got 5 combo (\"basket\") meals for about $38."}
{"text":"This Culver's probably doesn't even need its own exterior lighting thanks to all of the nearby car dealerships that have Camelback Road lit up brighter than Las Vegas! This was my first time to this particular Culver's, but I have been a fan of Culver's since moving to Arizona. Usually, I'll get a regular cheeseburger or a patty melt, but this time I decided to try a Pretzel Haus Pub Burger.  Unfortunately, I wasn't really impressed. I didn't like the tangy sauce they used on it. It's my fault since I read the sign (which indicated it had tangy sauce), but I didn't know just how tangy it would be. Of course, this is no reflection on this particular establishment. They completed my order just as I had requested (although the teenage boy who brought our food to our table seemed to have a chip on his shoulder as if he didn't want to be there). Overall, the place was clean, but had seedy looking characters hanging about. For instance, a few of them were just sitting at tables not eating or drinking anything.  They appeared to be homeless and seemed to be using the place as a refuge. (I probably would too if I was homeless and trying to avoid the bright lights outside.) I began to recite my \"I don't have any leftover change\" speech in my head just to be prepared, but fortunately none of them asked."}
{"text":"As always, Culver's continues to provide both excellent food and service. I had the Cheddar Butterburger with Bacon and it was wonderful! The employees were very polite, the restaurant was clean, and this establishment is located in an area that looks very nice. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Ice cream,  ice scream ... I scream for ice cream! 

Excellent spot for ice cream.  I didn't try the food options as we had already eaten dinner. We came in for a late night ice cream run and it well worth it. 

I got the thick thing called ...oh crap,  i can't remember. But it's the equivalent to the DQ blizard and it was great. 

They offer a flavor of the day too so if you are unsure of what to try you can go with the flavor of the day."}
{"text":"I don't know about the inside service but if you go through the drive-through bring a blanket and a pillow, horrible drive-through service long waits, Its all the snowbirds causing the long lines, wish they would go back north, i watch them ole birds fill their mouth with fat burgers and ice cream at that age eating all that fatting crap!! At least their is a hosp near!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and the same attentive service we come to expect. We eat here at least once a week now that they're in Tempe."}
{"text":"I Recently learned that the new ownership has fired a long time employee who has a disability, Steve.   Steve has worked at Culver's for 16 years and was considered by many to be a great worker and was always a highlight of our visit to Culvers in McFarland.  Im not sure why or what the new ownership (who also owns Todd drive and Cottage Grove locations) was thinking with this move - perhaps greed.  I'm not alone with my stance of not supporting a business that discriminate.  They lost my business and many others are equally as outraged to hear about this."}
{"text":"this was our first time.  we went through the drive through on 8/3/14 around 4:30 pm.  we ordered a single deluxe burger combo, chicken salad sandwich and a kid's grill cheese.  all the food except the chicken sandwich was good.  the crinkle fries were good too!  we did not get to try a wide selection from the menu because we were in our car driving back to northern az.

i would go back again and try other items from the menu.  our meal for 2 adults and 1 child was $20."}
{"text":"It's good for fast food but it is still fast food. I do go out of my way to eat at a Culvers when ever I am in Phoenix.  Definitely one of the better fast food burgers out there."}
{"text":"The parking lot is the worst-designed parking lot I have ever seen in my life! The wait time inside and drive thru are usually not horrible. Service is okay - every time I order custard, they always hand it to me all messy (custard dripping on the cups, holes on the cups,etc) - super sticky! Please make sure if a mess is made, clean them up before giving them to customers. Thanks :)"}
{"text":"My first time here. We were visiting family who brought us here. The burgers are fantastic. The line was short. Cheese curds were awesome. After we had lunch we then bought ice cream/custard. Wish we had these were we live."}
{"text":"A wonderfully nice Culver's that reminds me of home in Chicago.  It was very busy when we went in but the staff, from cashier to server, took time to make sure we had everything we needed and we understood how everything worked (especially in regards to kids meals and custard/prize redemption).

Food is spot on, fresh tasty with nice presentation.  They even had $2 short shakes which is a nice way to get a shake without having a lot of shake."}
{"text":"Great  customer service.  Great  selections for a fast  food kind of place.  Plus they  have  diet  root beer!"}
{"text":"Burnt super thin patty, and the greedy asses want to charge for ranch. 

The cheese sauce is okay.

As always food quality here is hit or miss. Tonight was a big miss."}
{"text":"Triple fail here today.

First they forgot cheese on my wife and sons burger.

Then when they ordered flavor of the day (butter pecan) they brought Olson vanilla.

To top it off the jackass  (teddy) who brought them took them back, brought back the right ones, but said \"you did order plain vanilla\"

To which my wife replied, Maybe your cashier put the order in as vanilla, but I said flavor of the day.

So... Poor customer service today."}
{"text":"No issues whatsoever today. Food was great and made correctly as ordered. Came out relatively quickly for being busy. They quality was good, no leftover tomato ends, and not half an onion on my veggie burger.  I also like that they actually carry gulden's mustard and my favorite salad dressing sesame ginger. A+"}
{"text":"Culver's always has awesome food prepared exactly how you want it.  Cheese curds are delicious and veggie burger is best around! Side salads are also very good, and I especially like the sesame ginger dressing."}
{"text":"I love Culvers!  I tell everyone I know how much I love Culvers! The employees know me, which is embarassing, because I order the burgers without seasoning, some peppery shit they shake on which I think ruins the flavor interplay of real beef and a lightly toasted, buttered bun.

 Not quite fast food, but certainly speedy, they make tasty burgers cheap.  A double is like 3 bucks.  Fries are ok, I like me some crinkle cut, but sometimes they're a little less than crisp. 10% discount with an iCard. I don't often stray from the burgers, that's why I go, but I've tried the chicken tenders and was not terribly impressed.  Rumour has it that other menu options (blackened chicken!  Cod!) are good - suffice it to say that if you aren't in the mood for a burger, there's probably something else at Culver's to suit you."}
{"text":"The first time we tried this location, it took over 25 mins for 2 corn dogs and 2 concretes to come out. It wasn't even busy inside. As we sat in our booth waiting, we noticed ants crawling in from the window seal. 
The second time I tried the drive thru and ordered 1 corn dog for my toddler. I ordered this item before, inside, and it was 1.00 + tax. When I ordered in the drive thru it was over $2.00. I don't understand the inconsistency in pricing. 
The only plus was the drive thru wait wasn't very long."}
{"text":"Stopped by late Sunday night around 8:30 and ordered two burger baskets. 15 minutes later our food finally came out. Burgers were over cooked to the point of being crispy and one even had a hole in the center so even more over cooked. Buns were dry and hardly any condiments on the burger. If we hadn't been so hungry we would have ask for our money back and left. Never again! Far cry from being a \" butter burger \"!!!"}
{"text":"This was my husbands first time at any Culvers,  I hadnot been in over 10 years.  We walked in and got hit in the face with a heavy smell of grease. Worse than any fast food joint I'd been in years.  So we immediately decided against getting any burger etc and just stuck with desert.   The frozen custard was great  no lines to wait in.

However the water from the soda dispenser smelled really bad like  wet dog.  It tasted ok but couldn't get past the smell and the thought that this same water is what is used to make the soda turn out stomachs.

We called the next day on a Friday and talked to the MOD to tell them about it. They said we should call back and tell the manager the next day ( why couldn't they just take a message and give it to the manager?)    We came back a week later and the water was still bad"}
{"text":"My 2nd time here, and I got to hand it to them, they got some really good fresh burgers.  The patties are fresh right off the grill. Tasty real meat topped with sliced american cheese, crisp lettuce, juicy thick tomatoes, pickles in between two nice size butter buns."}
{"text":"Their burgers are good, but their custard is why I keep coming here. It's about time the east valley gets a frozen custard place!"}
{"text":"Second Culver's location visited. Cookie cutter of other locations. Copypasta below:

When in Wisconsin, Culver's is a must. Butter burgers, cheese curds, and custard. Get your Wisconsin health food trifecta right here. Everything is super tasty. Interiors are clean, staff is happy. Mushroom swiss burger was top notch. Some patrons believe this is a full service restaurant and leave their garbage for the servers to pick up. It isn't - please bus your own table."}

It isn't - please bus your own table."}
{"text":"When my wife and I were completing a crossword puzzle together, I noticed a coupon on the other side of the paper. It was a two for one deal on the Culver's Value Baskets. We'd never been there before, but we decided to give it a try. It sounded like a good deal.

Our usual date night is Tuesday, so that's when we decided to go. As we approached the restaurant, we were happy to see there was ample parking. We easily found a spot near the door, a bonus, because my wife's knees make it hard for her to walk too far.

As we walked in, we noticed the restaurant was brightly lit and cheerful, with Christmas decorations displayed. We took our time looking over the menu's many options.

A smiling young lady took our order at the counter. I decided to go with the Double Bacon \"Butter Burger\" Value Basket with everything and extra pickles. I chose cole slaw as my side, but there were many other options, like french fries, onion rings, mashed potatoes, sweet potato fries, etc. My wife's appetite was not a big as mine, so she settled on the Double \"Butter Burger\" Value Basket. Following my lead, she also chose the cole slaw for her side.

With the coupon, the total was $9.27. Not bad for two people! We were eating in, so they gave us a number and drink cups. They had a wide selection of beverages, and we were both very happy with the Diet Root Beer. You couldn't even tell it was diet.

The receipt said we completed our order at 6:47 PM. After a 5 minute wait, a young man brought us our meals, piping hot. Though they were a bit greasy (they are \"Butter Burgers,\" after all), they were delicious. The cole slaw is also highly recommended.

Overall, a good experience. We will definitely come back if we can find another coupon."}
{"text":"Ught oh. Just found this place at over 40 weeks preggers and now I'm going to want it when I'm tryna get my skinny back. Damn. Well anyway, we had the chocolate malt shake (subbed chocolate concrete instead of the vanilla base they normally use cause duhh) & the vanilla concrete mixer with peanut butter and Reese's. Didn't eat all the foods cause I currently live on ice cream. maybe next time."}
{"text":"This is a counter service burger/ice cream place except that they give you a number and bring your food to your table. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which came on an oval seeded bun. It was OK but I've had better. The best part of my visit was the greeting I received when I walked in the door. The counter people made me feel they were genuinely glad to have me come.  The facility itself is nicely done and the fireplace is a nice touch."}
{"text":"I was shopping in Phoenix on a Sunday afternoon and got hungry and wanted to try a quick service restaurant that I don't have at home. I spied a long line and a full parking lot at Culver's so I decided to eat there. I was lured in by the crowd and their sign advertising \"Butter Burgers.\" 

The restaurant was packed and not very clean. The floors looked dirty, the soda fountain was sticky, and the couple of tables that were vacant had trash on them. I placed my order fairly quickly and the employees were friendly enough but not exceptional in any way. For example, the cashier let me order an additional side of cheese curds but neglected to tell me that I could've simply substituted them for the green beans that came with my burger. 

I got a bacon burger combo with a drink and green beans as my side, along with a side of cheese curds. Once my food arrived, I was disappointed. The burger meat itself was okay, served hot and appropriately seasoned, and the bun was puffy and buttery (too bad I'm trying not to consume any carbs)! The red onions were crisp and fresh, and the pickles were tasty. The problem was that this burger hit on two of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to restaurants: 1. the cheese was just slapped on my burger and was NOT melty AT ALL, and 2. the bacon was that disgusting pre-packaged, pre-cooked junk. A solid burger restaurant should never serve a burger with unmelted cheese and pre-cooked bacon! That's a major, epic fail!

The cheese curds were good but tasted like frozen junk food and the green beans were an absolutely disgusting afterthought! They weren't seasoned at all and were literally frozen beans that had been shoved in a microwave. They looked as unappetizing as they tasted. 

This lunch was pricey too and not worth the expense. I will not be returning to Culver's."}
{"text":"Tried this place again. A basket with a small cheeseburger and chili fries, large Pepsi and chocolate shake. The prices here are high for what you get. The shake was very good, everything else was just ok. The wait is pretty long. I prefer In n Out."}
{"text":"Way too slow, food poor, fish undercooked and mushy, grilled cheese burnt.
And over priced for fast (slow) food joint"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant after hearing about the \"famous\" butter burger. I won't go again. I had a double cheese  with bacon. Two patties that I am sure were 2 oz. each. So, for four ounces of over done patties I got a lot of veg on the \"burger\". My wife had the buffalo chicken basket. She had direa shortly afterwards. My burger basket and her chicken basket came to just under 18 dollars. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I love Culver's! The food is always fresh and quick. The Culver's in Verrado is awesome because it has an amazing air force tribute unlike any other I've seen at a \"fast food\" establishment. What a great way to honor the community!"}
{"text":"The owner, Dean Myer (sp?) took my order (which was fish) and then was surprised along with me at the price so took it upon himself to compare what I had ordered to the fish dinner and saved me $2. Too few business owners believe in customer satisfaction and kindness.  I will always be loyal to the Northside Culver's."}
{"text":"Had swiss and mushroom burger, it was so full of grease could not eat it. Would not recommend anyone go here for the burgers."}
{"text":"Culver's gets five stars on their custard alone. If you've never had it before, if it's done right, frozen custard is like the richest, creamiest ice cream you've ever had. 

Being MN/WI transplants, the boyfriend and I were quite excited when Culver's opened up in AZ and have since introduce many friends to the joy that is frozen custard. Now, in WI frozen custard is quite common and Culver's actually lands towards the bottom of the list for custard places. But here in AZ, Culver's shoots right to the top. 

They have a nice variety for their flavors of the day and if you're not into that you can make your own sundae. They have shakes too and in the fall they have a pumpkin pie shake that is the best thing in the world. it really tastes like pumpkin pie in a cup.

Their burgers are good, not my favorite. Surprisingly they have really good salads - I know, right? The boyfriend loves the cashew chicken salad and I adore the strawberry salad. 

They also have cheese curds which is great when I need a little bite of home.

Their staff is usually very friendly too, which is a nice change from some fast food places where they barely say hello to you.

So grab your Packers jacket and head over to Culver's for some dairyland delight."}
{"text":"I'm a devout fan of a particular burger place in the midwest that does not exist in Phoenix.  I missed it terribly, until I had my first burger from Culver's.  Now, I can head over to Culver's whenever I feel like one of those amazing burgers.  My only challenge is choosing between a butter burger, a reuben, a mushroom swiss burger, a pot roast sandwich or any number of other delicious things on their menu.

Oh yeah, they have great frozen custard."}
{"text":"Drive thru lady was rude! didn't even get a chance to speak asked for sauce she didn't even give it to me. The Food was disgusting  never coming back to this location ever again"}
{"text":"Well I have to give a shout out to my fellow yelper \"Daren C.\"! Good lookin out on the Culver's. I had an opportunity to make this journey over the weekend and was not disappointed! 

The butter burger is far superior to Freddy's Steakburger. I love the crinkle cut fries as well. This joint was packed on Saturday! I like that I can get grilled onions on my burger yum. 

Culver's is A+ I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We visited your restaurant on 12/18/2017. First of all $32.00 for 3 pieces of fish which was for two meals is outrageous. We are from Alaska where we can get fresh halibut for $40.00 for two meals. The fish had absolutely no flavor. The green beans were not cooked properly. They were hard and crunchy. Then I get home 90 miles away from your RESTURANT and I am sick and vomiting. Needless to say it was a horrible meal and a horrible experience. By the way 24 hours later and my stomach is still doing flip flops. If you are going to charge that kind of money for random whitefish you had better deliver. Culvers on Crismon Rd. In Mesa, Az. didn't."}
{"text":"First of all, this is Culvers.  I love the mushroom and swiss burger, delicious, I crave it and I am not a fast food person!   They custards are to die for and I am glad that I do not live by a culvers because I would probably try to eat there every day!  I love their food, service has always been great here!"}
{"text":"Who is managing this place. , better get his head out of his butt . Went there today , no ice cream of any kind,,  completely out of every flavor ???"}
{"text":"As a transplant to the Valley from Wisconsin, it's nice to find Culver's here. We stopped in for a custard. As I checked in I received an offer for a free one scoop of either vanilla, chocolate or flavor of the day. I chose the flavor of the day which was caramel cashew. My favorite! The customer service at this location is great, the store is clean and I will be back for a taste of Wisconsin every now and again."}
{"text":"If they had a Culver's on every street corner, the cardiologists would all have twice as much money.
I went there for my first time today for lunch, and I was hoping for a good, non-processed burger. I got my wish; a soft bun, red onions, lettuce, fresh tomatoes... all the fixings were great. The cheese was very good, and the beef patties were also good. (I got the deluxe). Since I never had fried cheese curds, I got those as my side item.  It was very reasonably priced; $8 or so for the combo with a root beer. Service was fast; food was fresh and hot. But here's the kicker....
I looked up the nutrional information after lunch, when I felt like I couldn't get out of my office chair. This combo had 84g of fat and 3000mg of sodium.  Even if you don't watch what you eat, these numbers should scare the hell out of you. To put it into perspective, my diet calls for 1500mg sodium DAILY.  I could've gone to In-N-Out, gotten an animal style double-double with fries and saved 15 grams of fat and saved 1300mg sodium. I could've ordered 2 quarter pounders with cheese and 2 large fries and still eaten fewer grams of fat and sodium. Now do you see exactly how bad these burgers are for you?!? Imagine if I had gotten the bacon cheeseburger with a custard for dessert. That'd be another 30 grams of fat. We're talking triple digits here. Scary stuff.
Now, I like to splurge on occasion for great food. Unfortunately, for that caloric catastrophe, it simply wasn't worth it. It's a good burger, definitely better than the typical fast food, but come on. These numbers are beyond reasonable.  To be fair, the fried cheese curds constituted 38g of fat alone. Now that I've had them for the first time in my life, I'll say I enjoyed them. They're almost as good as fried mozzarella, but I still prefer the Italian version over the Wisconsin one.
So if you want to splurge, enjoy the custard. I've had it once before here, and it's excellent; especially the vanilla. But if you want to blow your diet, even though the food is decent here, do it somewhere else."}
{"text":"While reviewing yelp for places to eat near my hotel, I saw Culvers and the cheese curds got me. I had to go and get my fix for dinner one night! Lots of people in the parking lot, and I went with the bacon cheeseburger with cheese curds. With a drink it came out to a little over $9. I asked for ranch instead of the marinara sauce that came with the curds and was told to drive up and wait for my food. A young boy (maybe 10?) came out with the food but when I saw marinara, I asked to replace with ranch. He happily said he would bring it out and I had to pull up more as the drive thru kept getting longer.

The burger was really tasty, for a fast food joint, it was good quality. The cheese curds were as good as can be!!"}
{"text":"I had to get my flavor of the day fix after a long day of cleaning. As always if you know your favorite flavor of the day it's great."}
{"text":"Friendly service from a super nice gal at the counter who was kind and polite, as I was very overwhelmed by the massive menu board of burgers and custards and drinks.

I eventually settled on two burgers and a small chocolate malt, placing my order and being given a number for my table even though it was to go. Nice to be able to sit comfortably while waiting.

It didn't take long and the same gal brought my bag of food to me with a nice smile and I was off. I got about five minutes down the road before I started to wonder why they would have put the malt in the bag with the hot food. It turns out that they had not. I'll take come blame for that, I should have at least checked. Oh, well.

Burgers at home were perfect. Cooked just right and the fries were still nice and crisp. Crinkle cuts always do well with ketchup. My wife *loved* it.

I'll still be back to Culver's. I'll remember to check my order next time though."}
{"text":"Love the custard and quality food!  Best place for cheese curds :)."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! If I could give a half star I would. I spent a whole morning vomiting my guts out over a burger and shake I had the previous nigh at this restaurant. I went with a good friend and they even got sick too! I've sat and watched the employees like a creep to see how often they wash their hands and need I say more... STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up with Culvers in the Midwest so I was happy to find this location nearby in Chandler. While I have always had a pretty good experience here customer service wise even during the lunch rush the food has always been only so so. The burgers lately have been really bland which is not the culvers that I remember from back home. The buffalo chicken fingers are really tasty along with the onion rings but lately leaving Culvers I feel unsatisfied. I will give Culvers another shot but I hope the flavor of the burgers improves a bit. So far it's just meh..."}
{"text":"Ok, I heard from someone that Culver's had cheese curds.  (For those that don't know what a cheese curd is then ready this wiki article.  Don't worry I didn't know about them until I came to Wisconsin.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_curds)    So, when class got out early today, I decided that I needed to hunt for the elusive curds.  The easiest place to come was here.  But the curds are not the traditional curds, they were fried curds, like fried mozzarella.   A nice snack but not exactly was I was looking for .... on with the search."}
{"text":"Where do you go after giving your left Gluteus Maximus a workout at the AMF Bowling on 83rd & Peoria?

Answer: 8.2 miles away to Culver's!

I wasn't very thrilled to go 8.2 miles out of my way just to eat at some ice-cream/hamburger joint, but my friends recommended it so I gave it a try.

It was a very nice place. The cashier lady who took our order was very pleasant. The manager even came to our table to take our trays away (of course, that was probably because we stayed a good 30 minutes after they closed, so that was probably his polite way of kicking us out). But he spoke very kindly! :-)

Unfortunately I didn't try their ice-cream, so I cannot comment on that. Their food, however, was satisfying.

So go ahead a give Culver's a try! You will be satisfied.

Now if only the soreness of my Gluteus Maximus would go away..."}
{"text":"We love this place! Staff are well trained! Food is excellent!! Very highly recommend this Culvers!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Visited it for the first time tonight. I ordered cheese curds and a pumpkin cheesecake custard via drive-thru. Woahhhh, heaven! Employees were nice as well.
Definitely shouldn't visit too often because I can already feel my butt getting bigger. 
Nice treat though :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love that Culver's cares that the animals from the farms where they get their meat are treated humanely and are not given any antibiotics or hormones.  I also love that they are an environmentally friendly and sustainable company with a LEED certified building.  Oh yeah, their food is awesome, too.  It's made to order, which may take a little longer than other fast food restaurants, but it is well worth the wait.  It tastes fresh, and it's delicious.  Hats off to this business!"}
{"text":"The fish is absolutely wonderful. I mean you know what's good there the custard and yeah the Butter Burgers are freaking awesome. But ever since I've had the fried cod I don't want to order anything else when I go to that place. And then I ate so much of it that I don't have any room for the dessert anyway. If I was on a island and I had to pick one food to keep me alive for the rest of my life I would pick Culver's fried cod with tartar sauce and unsweetened iced tea. God is good and so is my local Culver's."}
{"text":"So we are from the east coast and we've never heard of Culver's before. We were driving from Madison to Milwaukee and needed some drive thru fast food and saw the Arby's sign and exited the highway. As we were turning into the Arby's we saw the Culver's and were like... \"What is that? Should we try it?\" Best. Decision. Ever. The burgers are on par with or better than In-N-Out and actually look better in real life than the pictures on the drive-thru menu! The patties have a bit of a char which was amazing and gave the burger a satisfying crunch. The fries are better than any other fast food fries I've ever had. They're perfectly crispy and burn-your-mouth hot, which is how I like them. The custard is worth coming here for that alone.  I'm almost glad I don't live here or I'd eat here way too much. Good Job, Wisconsin! My only dings are that they didn't give us any ketchup or ask us if we wanted any and only gave us like two napkins. Just minor technicalities."}
{"text":"Culver's is fine. i liked it, but it did not knock my socks off! Basically, another burger joint"}
{"text":"I've gone back a few times since my last review. Every single experience has been fantastic! The burgers are pretty good, BUT do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin OMFG!!! Sooooo freaken amazing! 

Also their onion rings are pretty much perfect! 

And the fried cheese curd...just get it! I was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd, but holy deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Ok, so whoever the manager, or owner is. Some man I had the opportunity to place my order with. He was wearing a dress shirt & pants, def not your usual fast food garb. Well he's hot. If you care. If not, proceed below.

This was my first time at culvers. I generally try to steer away from greasy fast food but sometimes there's nothing better than the hot crunch of saturated fat and meat. So I decided to give culvers a try since I work close nearby. 

I ordered the chicken sandwich w no pickles and added Swiss cheese. I also requested no salt on my fries so I could feel better about the 1500 calorie nutrition decision I was committed to. The fries were perfect. Those cute little nuggets of crinkle were soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Everything you wished your mothers oven fries tasted like. The fries, great. The burger ... Heavenly. Nice and hot, the chicken sung a sweet serenade to my mouth as every bite echoed traces of melodic deliciousness. The bun was perfectly soft and had this buttery quality, the kind that sticks to the roof of your mouth when u bite into it. 

Suffice it to say, I was pleased. Wonderful service & wonderful food. Glad I had a good experience!"}
{"text":"Haven't actually been to the Deer valley Culvers (but will soon, based on what I'm reading here), but more importantly the other day when I drove by, there were loads and loads of film trailers out there for filming going on inside. Anyone know what it was?"}
{"text":"honestly i had high expectations of this place. but nowhere could prepare me for the price. It was very over priced here in my opinion. I had a coupon for a free value pack with the purchase of another, so i got that and then 1 scoop of vanilla custard. it was $15, when she told me the price i was like ummmm did u credit me the coupon. then i realized after taking a 2nd glance at the menu the meals are all around $10. i was like zaaayyyyuuummmmmm. Which would make my mini scoop pf custard around $4. again over priced. was it good, yes. my fav part was the onion rings. will i go again, probably not. because i don't believe in spending that much on fast food for 1 person. i thought WENDYS meals were high. Culvers has them beat. my tip here is if u go use coupons, if u dont have none take your pennies to where they will stretch like i prefer to do. for $5 more i could have sat down at chillis and ate a meal with a guest for the same price with 2 for 20 lol!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after an IKEA trip. They've only been open 3 days but the Culver's standard is strong at this location. The food was great and it was delivered by smiling kids. They got my dessert size wrong but I'm chalking that up to that fact that everyone is new and still learning the POS system. It's dangerous that we have a Culver's closer to us now though."}
{"text":"I've only ever been through the drive through, so as for service, I can't really say. As for the food, everything is at best, mediocre. The butterburgers are pretty awful in my opinion. They are extremely greasy, thin, overcooked, and have NO flavor at all. Even the toppings (Mushrooms etc) had no flavor. A little salt can go a long way! The mashed potatoes tasted like bad cardboard, and some of the other sides were pretty sad. The only good part of their food is the custard which is pretty good, as well as their shakes."}
{"text":"I visited this location in the summer of 2016 (I'm a little behind on reviews) and it was just fine. My gent and I stopped by on a weekday around 11 AM and ate in. As many reviewers have noted, this location still seemed to be getting its sea legs. The food was still a cut above most fast food places, but my order wasn't exactly right (my burger had some things I didn't ask for and also lacked some things I did) and the fries were just a hair underdone. The Culver's chain has spoiled me for expecting perfection so while my experience was fine it just didn't quite hit the mark. 

The restaurant does look nice and I like the updated look of the stone exterior and pendant lights as opposed to the more traditional fast food look of older locations with a lot of blue plastic and vinyl. Culver's isn't fancy, but their dining rooms, especially newer models like this one, are actually pretty inviting and I don't mind eating in. 

I used to live in this area and I wished for a Culver's so I didn't have to drive out to Middleton, but in retrospect I'm glad it was built after I left or I'd likely have gone way too often, service issues be darned."}
{"text":"A pretty reliable stop. This has been mostly a custard stop for me as opposed to eating a meal, but I've got no complaints about the food I've received when I do order more than a scoop - it seems on par with most Culver's locations. 

Booths have been clean, service has been prompt, and they do have some outdoor seating which is nice in the warmer months if you're not feeling the need for A/C. 

Upside: they offer some dollar deals like $1 root beer floats on certain days. I have been lured through the drive-thru more than once with their dollar offerings.

Downside: the parking lot/drive-thru design is a pain - we've been trapped in a parking spot on more than one occasion because of the line of cars behind us waiting to get to the window; I've literally resorted to getting out of the car to ask someone to wait to move forward so we can back out and leave."}
{"text":"I should honestly just start a list of all the Culver's locations I've been to because it feels like I've been to all of them. Most of my reviews are pretty much the same: hot, tasty food served with a genuine smile and in a clean restaurant with clean bathrooms. 

Even though the food at each Culver's is pretty standard across the board, every now and then you get a burger that's cooked and assembled in a way that's just a cut above the consistently good Culver's chain experience. My visit to the DeForest Culver's was one of those times. 

I got the cheeseburger kids meal. The fries were some of the freshest I've had - the outside were perfectly crispy and the insides creamy. The burger was juicy without being greasy, the cheese had melted into the patty, and the veggies and condiments were all in the right ratios that you could taste the individual elements without being overwhelmed by any one thing or the mix of flavors as a whole. 

My only regret, as always, was not having room for the custard that comes with the kids meal. I've got a stack of kids' custard coupons burning a hole in my wallet!"}
{"text":"Maybe not five-stars compared to every restaurant, but a five-star Culver's for sure. 

My friend and I stopped in on our way back from Eugster's Farm on a Sunday afternoon. Service was friendly, the food was some of the freshest I've had from a Culver's, and the kid's meal ice cream portion was generous. Throughout our visit tables were continuously cleared and cleaned, and as usual everyone working seemed to be in a great mood. 

The west side of Stoughton has cropped up with quite a few fast food places over the years, but among them Culver's is your best bet if you need something quick and easy."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Culver's in town. They always seem to have the freshest, juiciest, burgers and hot fries - most likely due to being off the highway and thus getting a solid stream of customers throughout the day. 

There's not a ton of space to wait for your food in the drive-thru, but they've figured out a pretty good system for pulling into the neighboring lot when the two designated spaces are full. Food has always come out in quick fashion and I've always (knock on wood) gotten the correct items in my order.

Bonus points to this location for their $1 deals - waffle cones, shakes, onion rings, and more are randomly offered via their billboard outside the restaurant. I can't lie - they've definitely drawn me in with their dollar waffle cones on more than one occasion."}
{"text":"I've dined in once or twice, but this location is usually a drive-thru ice cream stop for us. This location seems to be less busy than most, so we're always through the line pretty quick. On a recent visit I ordered a concrete mixer and the person who made it was very generous with the mix-ins, which is great. On the whole exactly what you'd expect from a Culver's, but for me just a bit out of the way for any sort of regular visits."}
{"text":"It's rare that I stop at this Culver's, though sometimes I hear its siren's call if I've been to the mall. It's set back from the road and the sign isn't on the mall side, so the flavor of the day can't suck me in most of the time. 

I believe I've only gotten custard at this location; I don't recall ever having ordered hot food. Maybe in my college days? In more recent visits the drive-thru has been slow (hence the three stars) and service inside has been reasonable. Custard toppings vary greatly; I've had the lightest touch on some days and the heaviest on others. 

I've never been to a bad Culver's, but this one also isn't the best, neither overall nor in Madison."}
{"text":"Came to this location  last night- Definitely not the best serviced Culver's. I ordered a single butter burger basket. I was charged for and received the deluxe burger which I didn't notice until later. No big deal. I opened/ate the food immediately upon receiving it. The entire bun was soaked and soggy yuck, and the fries were cold which was a major let down. Worst of all this gave me food poisoning. 

I will never come back to this place"}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this place from my friend Henry. But as many of time that i have driven by it I never tried it till just recently. We went there with a craving for a good burger. To say the least the craving was fulfilled and more. 

The burgers are made with fresh meat that is cooked crispy which is awesome for a fast food place. The Frozen custard is amazing and the featured flavor is amazing. 

I will have to go back many times as thier menu is huge and I want to try everything there."}
{"text":"4 stars for their bonfire s'mores frozen custard. 3 stars because they changed the milk chocolate flakes they put in it. 2 stars because they don't have this flavor as often as I'd like."}
{"text":"The butter burger was definitely better than the ones from McDonald's but not up to Five Guys's quality.  Prices are a bit higher than BK or McD's but they do have fried cheese curds, which were hot and delicious, and much better than tater or cheesy tots.  I also had an Oreo shake, which was very rich and creamy.  We need a Culver's on the East Coast.  Just be warned that drive-thru service can be pretty slow, at least at this location."}
{"text":"Cheese curds, concrete mixers and butter burgers. I've died and gone to fat kid heaven. The Cheese curds are the best. The concrete mixers are excellent. Love my Reese's and cookie dough. Have had the Burger, the  and the . All excellent.  Burger is my go to. The root beer az second to only A&W. Always polite staff."}
{"text":"Loved Culver's when we were traveling in the Midwest so we were thrilled when they opened one in the Great Charlotte area. 

We happen to be going through Rock Hill on a Sunday evening and went out of our way to go there.

The line to order wasn't bad at all. However, they were out of fried cheese curds.  That's like McDonalds being out of French fries. But we were there and hungry so we still ordered.  We got our concrete custard mixers right away. But then had to pull forward to wait with several other cars. Not so much fast food when you have to wait more than 5 mins for your food.

The food we did get was awesome and I still love Culver's just wish they brought the entire experience from the Midwest. This store was a miss."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and is ready pretty quickly. I'd say 1 out of every 4 visits my order is wrong. I'll ask for no tomatoes and they put tomatoes on my burger which is annoying since that's my only request."}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing frozen about this custard. Every time I come here, I get handed a concrete mixer that is already half melted. I once asked for a replacement, which was happily obliged by the friendly staff. I asked why their custard is always soupy and melted and I was given some half baked answer as to why frozen custard melts quickly.... Go somewhere else unless you enjoy soup-like custard."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today, wasn't really impressed, seeing the number of 5's on here.

The french fries are frozen, floppy, and they don't have much flavor. Maybe I'm spoiled by In n Out's real potatoes, but I like my fries tasting like potatoes. And seasoned, at least.

The chocolate malt was also just ok. In fact, it barely tasted like malt, and was way too sweet. I prefer a less sugary chocolate taste.

And finally, the burger. I got their Wisconsin Melt, which is essentially a patty melt with two burgers. 
It was well seasoned, but the seasoning was cut out by the amount of butter/griddle grease they use, so I could only taste the seasoning every once in a while, not good. Also, for a patty melt, there is a lack of onions, which I greatly disapprove of.

The whole thing was kinda greasy, and left a terrible feeling in my mouth afterwards, which is being currently washed down by a Becks.

In conclusion, just go to In n Out."}
{"text":"First time trying Culver's and it was pretty good for a fast food joint.  The family was all craving a burger and happened to be passing by so we decided to stop.  This is a great place to take the family.  The staff were all friendly and warm.  The establishment is exceptionally clean and well-maintained.  And the food, although a little pricey, was pretty good.  There was nothing really special about the burger but it was above average for fast food.  They also serve frozen custard, which we didn't try this time, but looked delicious.  I will say that the fries and cheese curds are both absolutely delicious.  And you must try the root beer as it is their own and quite tasty as well.  This is definitely a great stop if you want a quick yummy bite to eat!"}
{"text":"The tenderloins are not as tender as they were 5 yrs ago and the size of the tenderloin itself used to stick out all the way around the sandwich by at least an inch. Now they are MUCH smaller."}
{"text":"I brought a good friend here, as his introduction to the chain. After spending time in the Midwest I had grown a liking for Culver's custard. However, the service was really slow and my friend ended up with food poisoning that day. While it might be an unconnected incident, I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Oh, Em, Effing, Gee...I cannot believe I hadn't enjoyed this heavenly fast food spot until this weekend.  Actually, it is probably best that I hadn't and that there are no such restaurants near me...if so, I would most likely weigh 3 times what I do now.  I am not sure what they feed their staff (perhaps drugs?), but they are some of the friendliest fast food workers I've ever encountered.  Maybe they are so happy because the food they represent is just that amazing.  Or maybe they have kick-ass health insurance...who knows, but it sure is pleasant.  Mandi G. assured me that their friendliness was not just a fluke, and it's never anything less than pleasant.  I am thoroughly impressed that a major corporation is able to make a teenager smile and, at least appear to, enjoy their job. 

Butter Burgers...Butter Burgers...Butter Burgers.  I want to say it over and over and over again, it's just so fun!  Oh, and freaking amazingly tasty too!  It was kinda like the cheese in my Butter Cheese Burger was injected into the meat; that's how perfectly gooey it was.  To accompany my heart-attack-on-a-tray, I also got an order of Fried Cheese Curds.  O. M. G.  

I cannot say enough good things about Culver's, even their Root Beer was great.  However, I had to knock off a star for simply being fast food.   I will take it as a blessing that my next visit will not be soon at all.  I look at fast food as a treat, and not a daily meal replacement.  I felt like complete shit after the meal, and continued to feel that way until well into the following day.  It was worth it, though.  Mmm, thank you Culver's.  I'll see you next year!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times since it's near work...the burgers are pretty decent, the patty melt is very good. I think their fries leave a little to be desired, they are the big fat crinkly cut kind, and sometimes they can be a bit soggy.

The ice cream here is yummy. The only problem I have with it, is that it's usually so busy I can't get in and get out in my 30  minute lunch break. Kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"Just once I would love to get what you see on TV. The Culver's fish sandwich  ads I was really looking forward to a great sandwich. I would have sworn that the fillets were almost an inch thick with a good sized bed of lettuce - sauce, but that's not what I got on either the walleye or cod sandwich.  You would think that someone in Culver's management would be responsible enough to at least show in the ad what the sandwich is really going to look like. Doesn't anyone do \"Truth in Advertising\" any more?"}
{"text":"Kicks any of the majors severely in the grease trap.   It's like an In and Out with a menu, a Freddy's custard with better tasting food:)  It's hard to pick between them since on their basic items they are all pretty good in relation to anything with a 'king clown  of a ping pong ball advertising them.    

Good selection of sodas on tap, quick turnaround at lunch time and a change from string fries to crinkles. 

Here's why it's getting a 4.   They syrups   used on the custard are nowhere near good enough to match what they are sitting atop.
Banana's foster is great custard, fresh bananas and a hot syrup  that sadly screams cheapness and has a one note flavor."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, they gave me extra receese and a paper lip Jamie and kayley. Worked very great together great food great service I would give 7 stars if possible"}
{"text":"I will say the deserts are great and I will come back for those. But my meal. No way. Fish sandwich was overcooked and greasy. Plus I know I am a fat American but for 9 bucks I was really disappointed in the size of your meal. I was done in like 4 bites and still hungry. It looks like maybe I am in minority..... but I think this place should stop serving food and just stay with dessert!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fast food person, so this review is only for the ice cream at Culver's. My normal treat of choice is their chocolate malt shake, but I was craving a sundae. I ordered the Turtle, which is caramel and fudge sauce with pecans on Culver's custard. It definitely hit the spot. I like that there is no whip cream but I'm not a big fan of that on my sundaes and I could do without the cherry. Just give me plenty of fudge and caramel sauce. 

The location is kind of hard to get into. If you miss the first turn, you'll have to drive down to the light and circle back in the parking lot. I did that the first time I came here, but now I know better. Otherwise, it's conveniently located off the 101 and Shea. Definitely check out their custard ice cream, whether it's a shake or sundae."}
{"text":"I had never heard of a Culver's until this one popped up back in 2008 or 2009. A co-worker from a previous job told me how good their butter burgers are, so I decided to give it a try. For fast food, it's better than McDonald's or Burger King. But that isn't why I come to Culver's. What I really like about Culver's is their ice cream and milkshakes. They make a killer chocolate malt here. Whenever I am craving a milkshake, I only want Culver's chocolate malts. They also have a good Turtle sundae (pecans, hot fudge, and caramel sauce). This is definitely a guilty pleasure, but one I enjoy."}
{"text":"Don't go through the drive thru! I ordered2 mini concrete mixers, paid, I was given a number and told to park. After 20 minutes and seeing 6 cars get their order and go through the drive thru went inside and they couldn't find my order and said I didn't paid! Seriously?!?!? I'll never be back!"}
{"text":"My opinion about Culver's is meh.  Meat for the hamburger was, at least, real meat--but they make it thin.  Everything was fresh but their Butterburger to me was just fair.  I've had alot better for sure.
Then I had a 2 scoop cone which is something I never ever do, so you would think I would have been in heaven.  Well, I wasn't.  Not a big fan of their \"custard\" style fake ice cream made, surely, from a powder. Not much flavor in the vanilla at all, and the cherry chocolate was flavored but the fake ice cream itself is not very good.
Would I go back to Culver's ever?  Gawd, I hope not and only in a super starvation pinch would I eat there again. 
Not a fan here."}
{"text":"It tastes just like home (Wisconsin)! 

Butter burgers, custard, cheese curds and Walleye fish dinners ... ding, ding, ding, ding!  All in a fast food restaurant that can't be beat IMHO (narrowly beating on In & Out Burger).

Some complained about the service but I've had nothing but TOP NOTCH service here. The last time I was here a girl came around offering free custard samples and another staffer came around asking if everything was okay (try to get that service in any other fast food restaurant!).

And full disclosure ... I'm from Wisconsin which is where this franchise orginated so I maybe a little biased ..."}
{"text":"As you can see from my first 40 reviews I'm from Illinois and moved here last year. I'm so glad there's a couple Culver's around here. The butter burgers are outstanding. The custard shakes are great. I think what tops those but not by much is the cheese curds. Where are you getting cheese like this anywhere? I give these guys a 5 every time. The servers take your garbage so you can put your arms on the table and talk with the people you're with."}
{"text":"If I were to review Culver's ten years ago, I probably would have blindly raved about how phenomenal their burgers are. However, in the last decade, both personal taste and public standards have dramatically changed across the fast food landscape. With this whole \"premium\" burger craze that's currently happening, added to places like The Habit and Smashburger securing their own loyal fan-base, you can't help but wonder where Culver's fits into the mix.  

They seem to have a loyal following of Midwesterners. I can recall one proudly claiming that Culver's is \"their\" version of In-N-Out. In that case, I guess my Toyota Yaris is \"my\" version of a Porsche 911 Turbo.

Admittedly, their burgers are indeed a step above what you'd get at places like McDonald's or Burger King. They're not really anything spectacular, but they're fine for a quick burger fix. They automatically assume you want a double patty, so be sure to tell them otherwise if you do not. I've always liked their cheese curds, despite the fact that they inevitably wreak havoc on my stomach almost instantaneously. As a guilty pleasure, the curds alone are enough for them to earn an extra third star.

The frozen custard is better than what you'd get at Freddy's Frozen Custard, whose consistency is always too damned runny. There's a flavor of the day that varies by location and all kinds of combinations you're free to toy around with.

I guess I see Culver's as kind of a middle ground between some of the best traditional fast food restaurants (e.g. In-N-Out, Habit) and the crappy national chains with bloated marketing campaigns like McDonald's and Burger King.

I'd only recommend as a convenience - but not much else."}
{"text":"A couple disclaimers... 1) I despise fast food places and avoid them like the plague. I usually only eat at one on road trips when there is no other food for hundreds of miles. 2) I'm a vegetarian. No burgers or chicken tenders for me. That really limits my choices. 3) I don't really like ice cream. I don't hate it but I'm not obsessed with it like most people are. Yes, I have a pulse.

I leaving PV mall and was trying to get to a pedicure appointment. I saw Culvers and had a weird craving for fries. I pull in their drive thru and see that they have a grilled cheese kids meal. I decide to give it a try despite the sorry excuses for grilled cheese other fast food places have. (Sonic's grilled cheese is a soggy disgusting mess.) 

Surprise! The grilled cheese was toasty, buttery, oozy goodness! Don't underestimate the power of a good grilled cheese. This one actually made a crunch sound when I bit into it. 

The fries were crispy, salty, and piping hot. Not freshly cut or anything but they did their job. 

So even if you are not a vegetarian and don't plan on ordering a grilled cheese from Culvers you can still learn something from my review. I believe you can tell a lot from a restaurant by their grilled cheese... if they can pull that off you are safe to order. I plan on returning with the fam. (Those weirdos are ice cream obsessed.)"}
{"text":"Kids love it...employees are nice.  Food was prepared correct and brought out pretty quick.  The custard was tasty and I was impressed with the burger."}
{"text":"So many flavors to choose from and there's all sorts of American classic foods!

I have a BOGO free, so we got a 2 scoop sundae of Mint with fudge and oreos and then a vanilla with strawberries and oreos.  I thought they were both good, but both kids said they were really runny and melted quickly.  Kid #2 said the mint was too strong for her but Kid#1 didn't have any other complaints.

It was really packed inside and line of cars, but we didn't wait in line and our order was available within like 5 minutes.  

I might give it another try later and order the burger/fries shake maybe."}
{"text":"The friendliness of the staff and manager, Joe was superb!!!! I will definitely be returning. Customer service like that is unfortunately very rare so when I receive it I think it's important to point it out! Way to go Joe!!

Oh, the food was great!"}
{"text":"Waited over 45 minutes to get my food, then it was wrong! Manager tried to fix it, but kept getting upset with his employees in front of me which was unprofessional."}
{"text":"Once again, the Swiss mushroom hamburger and Atlantic cod sandwich were the BEST ! And of course we celebrated National Hot Fudge Sundae day at Culvers !  It was an amazing day ! !"}
{"text":"On principle, Culver's deserves 5 stars. This location isn't the best representation but it's a nice hold you over until you can visit the Todd Drive location in Madison, Wisconsin. 

People that think Chick-fil-A has great service can't have ever never ever been to a Culver's. #notypo

Anywhoo, like my brother says: consider the source. 

I can recommend any burger. The fish sandwich as its not your McDonald's square or circular option. Their tartar sauce is a legit Culver's recipe and it works. 
I think all the branches have stopped selling fried chicken like a KFC, yet they still offer chicken sandwiches. 

I can't eat custard but the nieces all say it's great. They sell it year round. The crown jewel is the LEMON ICE. Add fruit and have a gay ole time. 
Yet, they don't sell it year round. 
Sad face. 

They have cheese curds, onion rings, soup, brisket type sandwiches. Pot roast meals. The dippable ketchup. Mashed potatoes are a side here as well. Monthly calendar listing the custard of the day.  

Everything ENTREE wise is made to order. Sweet potatoes fries. Cheddar, swiss, pepper jack cheese slices are available.

A snack pack is big enough and the cheapest meal possible. Usually $5.55 after tax. 

Kids meals come with an immediate dessert or you can save the tag to buy kiddie things once you have enough tags. 

Drawback: Pepsi products. But this is the Carolina's so y'all will enjoy. 

Across from Carowinds and 17 gas stations. They've hired new staff and mgmt. 

Chicken tenders and grilled cheese are meal options. If you dine in they'll give you a number and bring your order when it's ready. 

Drive-thru: they'll give you a number and you'll wait in the designated parking spots for your fresh order to be delivered to you. Check those fries, sometimes they will be stale. Or older than your entree.  

Best thing I can offer: sign up for their club and get all the deals. 
Butter is On the bun. Hence butter burger. 

No play area. 
No tipping needed. 
WiFi is at every Culver's.  
P.S. the one in university city doesn't make their lemon ice just quite right so this location is your best option.  The other place is new so they're probably still figuring it out."}
{"text":"They're on GrubHub now. 

Daily Dollar deals & Lemon Ice year rond at this location. 

Lemon Ice year round keeps me loyal plus the indoor patio doesn't hurt when it's time to study."}
{"text":"Based on one slightly unfair visit due to an unruly 3yr old demanding ice cream. 

I ordered 'two of those on the picture out the front', meaning the scrumptious looking specimens on the boards before you enter. Unfortunately, the cashier didn't quite know what I meant - my own fault for not being specific I guess......but then what was served-up were two plops of 'frozen' custard (strawberry and chocolate) - there were supposed to be m&m's in both, but we ended up with double in the chocolate - with that much in the pot, it was inedible (nearly broke a tooth), whilst the strawberry version was a tasteless mess. I didn't have time to have a famous burger, and the frozen custard was not really what I was expecting.....

Decor was nice for a chain, sport on the tv was a plus. Maybe next time I'll have more time to sample other stuff, and will change the scoring appropriately."}
{"text":"Culver's butter burgers are the only fast food burgers I'll ever eat, they are sit down restaurant quality if not better. I also really enjoy their breaded chicken really nice pieces of all white meat tenders. And the cross plains mount horeb and dodgeville locations have a rewards program which I've been using for a while now, I haven't earned a reward yet so I'm not sure what they are, but I'm close! There are also days where they offer really good deals on specific items (like hot fudge sundaes on national hot fudge sundae day, or dollar burger day) those are some of my favorite times to visit. Also super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Always a fun time with custard! The employees here are always incredibly nice and make you smile! The only problem is it takes forever to get the food!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place n well eehhh its ok. Same as any other burger place. A lil over priced if u ask me. Meat patties r thin as hell. But i gotta admit the sundaes n ice creams r pretty delicious.! If i were to come bak it would be to try the shakes other than that I'll pass....i didn't even get a chance to take pics of my sundaes cuz we devowered them lmao..."}
{"text":"Alright, I'm just gonna say this, I enjoy their burgers more than In N Out, and I LOVE In N Out. Fries are \"ok\" and you can add tons of toppings to your dessert. TONS of variety on the menu. A few nice TVs scattered about. It's a great place. Try it!"}
{"text":"I normally would Recommend Culver's but not THIS location. How disgusting of a human being do they have working there. My brother is handicap and he gets around on a skateboard & he went to try and order ice cream and one of the employees by the name of Kelly decided she was just gnna ignore the fact that he was there and walk away. What a disgrace of a human being and company for allowing someone to treat people that way. I will not be going back at this point"}
{"text":"I love this place! Every location in the valley is great! The mushroom and swiss double is my favorite! I dont even add anything to it. Always friendly staff. They do a great job here. Also very impressed with the soups and chilli! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"A bit of the Midwest in Az. Our friend who used to reside in Minnesota was stoked to come upon this Culver's. Order anything with the word \"butter\" in it our friend excitingly recommended. We walked in and I was overwhelmed. The menu is huge! 

The staff behind the counter were extremely helpful. They had a bit of the Midwest sweetness. They explained the many options and helped us make decisions. They were really adorbs! 

We left with butter burgers, custard, fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"Good food Horrible service!!!!!!!!  They need to have an intervention with a Dr. of Customer Service.  Management please step it up, help your staff be considerate and respectful.  

No matter how good the food is if I receive horrible service more than once, you get one star."}
{"text":"This is the best place we have found for breaded pork tenderloin sandwiches!  They are amazing!  Their custard is well worth the price!!  Just like homemade and so many options!  Get a frequent customer card and get free custard AND a free sandwich basket after so many stamps.  Great place!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"cheese curd and coleslaw. I know, its a weird combo but i like that the best so far! 
I tried the shrimp dinner that came with butterflied shrimp, dinner roll, fries, cole slaw. With a side of cheese curd. 

Ive always like their cheese curds, its like cheese stick but bite size:) 
The shrimp dinner is nothing special, but the cole slaw that came with it is surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of all Culver's always. You can always expect the same food and get exactly what you want. This location is probably my most visited, and I really like. A large spacious room in the back with a tv that plays sporting events and such. Generally clean and well kept facilities. 
The staff are always wonderful, friendly, and helpful!"}
{"text":"I don't go to this Culver's because of the panhandling problem in their parking lot.  Too intimidating."}
{"text":"Bacon butter burger was as good as it gets. The family shared a large cheese curds and it went fast as always. The fries and root beer were on point also. The highlight of the meal was the Oreo mint blast. It was amazing."}
{"text":"They cook their burgers until they're well-done, and then cook them a couple minutes more to reach that desired internal temperature of infinity. The result is always tough and dry, almost bacony texture, but there is a good beefy flavor to it. Once I got a burger cooked to medium, and it was juicy and pretty darn amazing all around, but it never happened again, so I think it was a mistake.

I'm not crazy about their fries, but their onion rings are great. I definitely recommend an upgrade to the onion rings. 

Unless you order a delux burger, their sandwiches are dry by default, and they ask you what you want on it. They don't have the available toppings and condiments listed anywhere, not even on their website! Some day I'm going to go over there with a tape recorder when they're not busy, and when asked what I want on it, I'm going to say \"uhhhhh, what have you got?\". Because what if they have something amazing like caviar or duck fat that I don't even now about?"}
{"text":"We just had a worse experience at a Culvers ever! And the manager Christina did nothing to fix the situation she actually made it worse. I guess it was our fault we came to close to closing time and they wanted to leave so four different people came to ask us... are you using this, can we put away this, can we do this. we were being put out of the restaurant it was very very rude.  After about 10 minutes of this we finally gave up and told him we were leaving they did not care I'm sure we made your f****** day."}
{"text":"I have eaten there in the past and has been a while.  Food was very good when this restaurant first opened.  Just went there 01/18/2014. I ordered the chicken dinner to go, and it was the worst crap ever.  First the cashier ran back and asked the cook if there was any chicken.  I received 2 legs and  thighs which tasted and looked like it sat under a heat lamp for hours.  For the price your paying u think it would be fresh!  Quality has definitely went down.  Will never again go to this culvers location again."}
{"text":"What can I say, the burgers are fantabulous, the custards are the bomb!"}
{"text":"I recently came to this restaurant to dine in with a few children. When I came here on a Saturday, it was super busy. I think the menu is kind of busy and there is no signage up for the basic custard flavors. It took us a bit of time staring at the menu to figure out the layout  I chose the standard butter burger meal, the kids had kids meals. I really think it's great that every kids meal gets an option of having Ice Cream now or saving the coupon for later. I really thought that this place was hyped, but my burger was really good. I of course had desert. I had a mini custard with kit-kat and butter finger mixin's. Yumm.... I am pretty sure I'll be back for custard."}
{"text":"Food was great and hot and the concrete mixer was SWEET. Eat with confidence."}
{"text":"Just had the best experience today! They had messed up my order at first but were real good about correcting it. I must say though, your employee, by the name of Billy went above and beyond in customer service! Really appreciated all he helped us with. Give that man a raise!"}
{"text":"Saw this ad on TV about their chicken tenders. So I decided to give it a try. When you enter this place, it is huge. The cashiers are on your left as you enter and if you're trying to look for chicken meals, it is over in the far left of the signs. About 1/12 of the space is dedicated to the   chicken. I thought this would be a restaurant and not a fast food place.

I ordered the fried chicken dinner, which can be 2 or 4 pieces, didn't see a 3 piece dinner. I ended up getting the 4 piece which is basically half the chicken. It was breast, thigh, drumstick and wings with mash potatoes, biscuit and  coleslaw. 

The chicken was tasty, mashed potatoes was a bit dry and the coleslaw was OK. Since I had dinner by myself, I'll have to take my wife here for lunch so we can try the butter burgers."}
{"text":"For fast food, Culver's is better than average. All the food is made to order and the quality is good. 

And of corse, you must have the frozen custard. A small is probably sufficient, as custard much is richer than ice cream or frozen yogurt!"}
{"text":"I love Culvers I eat here all the time! But sometimes there restroom aren't the best. But the food makes up for it! Everyone always has a smile on here and they make me feel good about myself when I come in!"}
{"text":"Well after waiting in line for 15 minutes in the drive thru I then got cold food and a melted concrete mixer to bring home to the family. I would probably not make a special trip to eat there inside either. I've never had a butter burger before so I wasn't sure what to expect. I think I will stick to Whataburger even though it's a little further from home. At least the food is hot when it is handed to you and the burgers are better in my opinion. Not impressed with all the excitement and lines to get a burger."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, but after three visits we are not fans.

- Location is clean and the employees are nice but not necessarily helpful.
- Burgers are a higher quality for fast food but on the expensive side.
- Fries are super greasy.
- Cheese curds are nasty.
- Custard is not much better than a dairy queen soft serve quality.

Every time we ate here, we felt like crap afterwards. So many better, cheaper fast food options."}
{"text":"We tried this Culver's on Friday 4-14-17. It was our first time at a Culver's and we loved it. A big thank you to Jaci, who helped us and made a great first impression. She answered our questions while being very pleasant and friendly, smiling the whole time. She had energy and is what customer service is all about! This Culver's was close to our hotel, so we tried it and enjoyed the experience so much we went back the next day, and would have returned the following day as well, but it was closed for Easter. My wife had a salad and said it was perfect, while I enjoyed the cod fish and chips. The fish was plentiful, with big portions prepared just right, and came with crinkle cut fries (my favorite), and the cole slaw was perfect. The Culver's root beer is right up there with Barq's and A&W. The next day we had the pot roast dinner - delicious, thought I was at my Mom's house! We also enjoyed the frozen custard which tasted better than ice cream. Culver's is our new go-to restaurant the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"The biggest mistake culvers location did is hire women. Specifically women who fuck up a Simple order because they themselves are simple. By the way I'm not sexist."}
{"text":"I think this a great option for a small community! They have a great variety of food! And the best French fries and ice cream! We get the kids meal a lot which includes a scoop of ice cream for now or later which I love!"}
{"text":"This place deserves a 1 period. I came here for dinner after traveling all the way from Paradise Valley. My smartphone was gonna die and I sat at a table with an outlet so I could plug my phone into charge so I can user the web while I eat . a customer chewed me out in front of the 2 friends I was with. For no apparent reason other then me charging my phone. Talking about beyond rediculus. This one tales tops it. There is a culvers on cave creek and bell road. That is only 3 miles to the north from my home on thunderbird. No excuse in that not at all. I can see her telling at me if I was actually doing something but when I was just charging my phone. Something has got to give."}
{"text":"I rarely eat red meat. But then I found Culver's butter burgers. The best I have ever eaten.  The concrete mixers are the best as well. Can't remember the last time I went to Dairy Queen.  The service is A+ as well. I'm due for another trip to Culver's."}
{"text":"They have amazing burger! Get something with cheddar cheese, theirs is the best we have ever had. Also who doesn't love a restaurant with their own root beer? If I had more room this would make the best root beer float in the world!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever eating at a Culver's. My husband and I honestly wish the was one in the PNW. Looking forward to our next visit next spring."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is fast food...with some niceties, the ambience of McDonald's, but the customer service is definitely a cut above. Once you've ordered at the counter, you go sit down with a number, rather than standing there in the way of others trying to order. The staff is extremely friendly and they bring your food out to your table, so you can sit and talk to your friends.
We love the Rueben Sandwiches on grilled buttered rye: it's not Katz, but it's close by and tasty. You get a choice of sides, one of which is Fried Cheese Curds, crispy on the outside and wonderfully melty on the inside.
The Butter Burger was good, but I really don't see what the fuss is over the Midwestern beef. It tasted ordinary as far as the meat goes. The grilled butter bun was light with crispy edges. It made the sandwich.
Also they are known for their frozen custard. They always have Vanilla and Chocolate, and a different flavor every day. You can pick up a custard schedule so you know what flavor they will be serving. Custard is very smooth, smoother than ice cream, but theirs is also sweeter, and the flavors are on the bland side. I tired the Strawberry Bon Bon on one visit: way too sweet and very little strawberry flavor. The next time I had Orange Cream-sickle: once again not much orange flavor, very sweet and on top of it, they mixed in Graham cracker pieces, which I really didn't like. They have mix-in you can add to the custard and they make sundaes as well. 
The fried chicken at the next table looked good and people were remarking how good it was. I'm going to try that next time.
It's a little more expensive than most fast food places, but KFC is higher."}
{"text":"I liked the fast, friendly, welcoming service, the clean and new dining area with upbeat background music, and the delicious chicken sandwich with tasty (and not greasy) fries. Very nice!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Culver's.  I had a butter burger with cheese.  It was very good, I thought similar in taste and quality to In and Out.
The cheese curds were fantastic, I highly recommend them.  They taste basically like a good mozzarella stick appetiser at other restaurants.
Also had a cookie dough concrete mixer.  It was as good as advertised.  Thick and tasty.
Only detractors to coming here-cost and high fat/high calorie.  High fat/high calorie goes with any fast food though.  The cost however is much more than a typical fast food place.  $24-26 for two of us getting food basket combo and two med concrete mixers.  So not extremely costly, but more than typical fast food."}
{"text":"Sort of an upscale Dairy Queen. Decent for fast food although a little pricey. It's easy to spend 10 on a meal. they have a fairly large menu. The pork tenderloin sandwich is good. Not something you see everyday. The chicken sandwich is good although not quite at the level of chic fil a. Burgers are better than most fast food. Fried chicken is good but a thigh and leg aren't enough food. Fries are just average. The ice cream is really good."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service. Always very accomadating, happy, and helpful. 

For example,  my last trip there a new cook accidentally started the wrong meal. Manager came out to let me know it would be a few more minutes.  

Food is always fresh and hot. I really enjoy the concrete mixers, haven't gone to DQ since finding out about their custard."}
{"text":"On the suggestions I've seen here, we decided to head over to the Mesa Culvers today for lunch. I'm pregnant and have been craving frozen custard (yes, distinctly frozen custard, not ice cream). The menu of sandwiches and whatnot is what drew me in otherwise. 

I had a bacon cheeseburger (single patty) and some of the crinkle cut fries. My hubby had a basic cheeseburger, but opted to try some of the chili cheese fries. My daughter had a hot dog, side of applesauce and milk (kids meals also come with a coupon for a few scoop of the frozen custard). 

To top my own meal off, I got the Culvers Rootbeer (caffeine free). 

Hubby liked his hamburger and accurately (in my opinion) described it this way: Reminds me of when places like Wendy's and Burger King used to really cook their hamburgers from raw meat over real grills.. as opposed to what they taste like now, which is microwaved frozen cooked patties. 

They were seriously tasty! I really enjoyed my hamburger. Right down to the bun. I snuck a taste of hubby's chili cheese fries and they were really good, but nothing super special. However, i could see wanting to come back and have a basket of those as my meal. 

My daughters hamburger was served on one of the signature butter grilled buns, and it tasted awesome. But I should have remembered that she doesn't like grilled hot dogs. So next time we'll get her the chicken.. but this time she ate the applesauce and some of the crinkle fries from my meal and was pretty happy. 

On our way out we redeemed the coupon for the custard and she got a scoop of vanilla. I got a scoop of choc. and vanilla on a waffle cone. I REALLY wanted to try one of the other desserts (like a concrete or a milk shake) but I just decided to try the basic custard. It was so delicious! Just what I wanted.. that creamy custard type consistency (so different from ice cream.. less airy and icy and more creamy). 

I can honestly say that it's good that i don't live right next door to it. I would be there a few times a week otherwise!

I signed up for their e-club and got a coupon for a free basket with the purchase of a basket but i forgot it. So now I know I at least have to go back for that! haha. 

With so much on the menu that I want to try, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a decent salad, then saw a very inviting picture of a Rueben sandwich.  Five dollars for what looked like an ample hunger stopper seemed like an easy target.  To my surprise, said Rueben was meager in size, and the three strips of steamed corned was maybe a step above \"Kwik Trip\" level.  I thought about returning it, but you never know what happens when it goes back.  I'll find another option for that selection-problem solved."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a change of pace from my usual place after getting gas in SC.

I've actually never heard of this chain before but this midwest-based chain seems to be happy expanding into South Carolina.  

I would describe this place as a fast casual place.  It's not quite fast food since you order, get a number and someone brings out your food later. 

The menu is large, extensive and easy to read.  You have several choices of sandwiches including burgers, prime rib, reuben and more.  Also there's several options for sides including fries, cheese curds, chili cheddar fries and more.  And then there's the frozen custard.  It's like ice cream but better!  Another Midwestern treat.

I went with the reuben which was recommended by the order taker.  Made it a combo with cheese curds and a drink. Then I waited (cue jeopardy theme).   

Finally, it came out with an apologetic staff member.  Well the sandwich was well worth the wait.  It was the 2nd best reuben I've had recently.  Good flavors, mix of kraut and meat and slightly covered in a tangy thousand island sauce.  The cheese curds were a bit disappointing as they seemed to have been in the fryer for too long and were almost rock hard on the outside.

The seating in the dining room is too close together where you can barely move when all thee tables around you are occupied.  And the parking lot can be a bit awkward.  They definitely used every inch of space, inside and out.

Also the drive thru was quite busy although it didn't look it was very efficient.  You paid for your order and then it looked like you had to pull up into one of 6 spaces and wait for your order.  Might as well go inside if you have to do that.

Perhaps, the kinks haven't been worked out yet or perhaps this isn't as much of a well-oiled machine as a fast food joint.  But I would come back here for the reuben and maybe even try a few other things off their menu."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on opening night.  This Culver's   There were a ton of employees working, and we were greeted by a couple at the front door.  There were also several working the register, though it seemed to take longer than it should before we placed our order.  (Note:  we used a coupon, and didn't notice it until we were leaving but they did not take the coupon off.)  

The wife got a grilled chicken sandwich and I had a double Butterburger (I think they call them this because the buns are toasted with butter, not because they are cooked with butter) with cheese and a side of mashed potatoes.  And of course, the awesome Culver's root beer.  The sandwiches and drinks were good, but the mashed potatoes were average.  Maybe I'm used to the ones from the DV location, but I normally scarf Culver's mashed taters down, but not so much here.  Don't get me wrong, I still ate them all, but they were as good...  

During the meal the manager was working the floor and we had a nice brief chat with him.  Later, some employees were giving out samples of their pomegranate ice cooler.  It was fine, I liked the consistency and I think in the future I will get a cooler, though maybe a lemon one.

Three stars to Culver's.  The coupon incident and the mashed potatoes knocked them down.  Not sure if I'll go to this location again unless I'm meeting someone.  The Deer Valley one has always been good to me, plus it seems like the DV one is much easier to get to with less traffic/congestion on the surrounding streets."}
{"text":"They changed the formula on their mashed potatoes.  It took them from 'always delicious' to 'so gross I didn't even eat 1/4 of them'.  I emailed Culver's and the response was that they changed them so they could be aligned with the rest of the chain and match up with the nutritional guide.  So really, two strikes, 1/ sucky mashed potatoes now and 2/ apparently I was relying on an inaccurate nutritional guide for several years and dozens of visits..."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my wife and kids. A couple of times. This place is somewhat new to me, but, very very good. I really like their hamburger patties, they're kind of thin, like a steak burger. 

Their fries are really good as well. The standard crinkle cut fries. They are cooked just right. 

They also have a lot of extras at this place including Wisconsin cheese curds, shakes, malts, ice cream, etc. 

It's like a dine in experience mixed with fast food. Very nice atmosphere. 

Staff is professional, clean, knowledgable of their products. 

Overall I rate this place up there with the nicest of burger joints! 

You've got to give them a try."}
{"text":"Sara B. wrote exactly what I was thinking.  I'm a big fan of Culvers.  This place puts every day fast food to shame.  Their food isn't sitting there waiting for someone to order it.  It's fresh and made to order.  They have a huge menu of options at good prices and you get quality service with a smile."}
{"text":"Normally i love there food, but this location was horrible!  The hamburger tasted like it had sat for a good hour before i got it...stale, dry,tastless. Sorry guys but yucky!"}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere, order at the counter and they bring it to you.  Burgers are fresh and hot.  Order the cheese curds, it is an extra $1 with your basket, but they are like mini cheese sticks!
The custard (ice cream!) is smooth and made on site. Great as shakes too."}
{"text":"I came here on  04/17/18 time 9:44pm  and I asked the staff nicely to cook my food fresh as I live a distance away from the restaurant and they told me to move my car up as they told me they were making my food fresh as I received my food I felt with my food was not hot but I didn't think a second thought about it but when I came home the display of my food was lackluster my fries were cold and hard as they have not been cooked and my fish was very cold as I've been here previous times and my food has always been fresh I'm just disappointed at this display that this staff did not listen to my needs I even called when I was home to complain about my order and nobody answered the phone completely disrespectful"}
{"text":"Love this place for some great burgers. Beats In and Out, McDonalds and others in my opinion. 
The great selection of sides are nice too. I recommend the cheese curds if you don't mind spending an extra dollar. 
The deluxe is my favorite, but I've had their cranberry salad, concrete mixers, lemon ice and other goodies they have to offer. The lemon ice is especially great during the hot summers. 
They're a little pricier then other fast food joints, but their food quality is far superior."}
{"text":"So far so good. This was our first time eating here and we were not at all leaving hungry and unsatisfied. Staff was very patient and polite and very helpful. She also offered coupons on top of our online deals and that right there saved us half off of everything. We all had a different kind of butter burger. All extras are also free I couldnt tell you which one was better than the other so try whatever your heart desires at the moment and you will not be disapointed. I did take a bite of everyones burger so I know they are all good. We also had onion rings cheese curds and chili cheese fries. I just love those cheese curds I will always order those everytime I go. One thing in my opinion is that the burgers are a good kinda greasy so grab some wet naps at the condiment station. I also feel they lack in the salt in fries and maybe in burger too if you want some salt with your buttery burger there is nothing wrong with that. If you are on a diet you shouldnt be eating here anyway. I will mention they do serve salad but why suffer watching everyone else indulge in delicious burgerness and topping it off with some good ol concrete ice cream? Not me... with all that being said I will come back I hope it goes as well as it did today. This will be a fam fave."}
{"text":"I grew up in frozen custard capital and have had frozen custard all over this country. That being said the Culver's at Metro Center doesn't know how to make proper custard. The feel, taste and texture were off. Now that could have been because the sundae I ordered was made several minutes before I ordered it. I determined this as the whipped cream was melted and half the ice cream was melted. Not to mention since I ate the sundae I have not felt well. I will not be visiting that Culver's anytime in the future."}
{"text":"Concrete mixers are beyond words. Mushroom Swiss burger is delicious! I'm not one for eating food from a drive thru but there's an exception for everything! My only complaint is I wish they were open later for my late late night ice cream, pardon me, CUSTARD cravings (the angel on my right shoulder is very grateful they aren't open later)!"}
{"text":"Affordable, fast, and yummy! 

Loved their Deluxe burger and chocolate frozen custard! 
Choco frozen custard was soo smooth and creamy--you won't be able to look at ice cream the same! 

p.s. their cheese curds are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Food was good, order taking process was really bizarre.  A person was helping me order, and didn't understand fully that I wanted a double butter burger (e.g.: So you want a single burger with that?) - and then a coworker interrupted him, said he could take the order, and then they proceeded to fight over who would take my order, and finally I was able to complete the order.  It was very odd.  HOWEVER - the cheese curds were fresh!"}
{"text":"The Staff is super nice here and the food is always brought out fresh to your table. I would definitely recommend anyone to visit this location."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, since my kids (and I) love the Custard. Though the 4 times we have eaten Brazier items I have been disappointed. 
-I have ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger 2 times and both times SERIOUSLY LACKING Mushrooms (5 small sliced mushrooms on one and 3 on the other). I went up to the counter both times  and they said that was the standard amount!???!  
-Burgers are yummy but very thin patty and too much bun.
-Fries are good but inconsistent in how they are cooked to completion.
-Chicken Fingers have breaking that overwhelms the meat.
I feel it is not worth the premium prices. $48 for 5 kids and 1 adult to eat was more than I would like to pay, for a fast food experience! 
Disappointing food. Amazing Custard."}
{"text":"My wife likes culvers much more than I do. For me the slices just OK, but she really does like it a lot and she's not much of a fast food person. While I love the fact they have ice cream as well as food, I do think the custard isn't nearly as good as regular ice cream."}
{"text":"Grease thin burgers.  Custard is the best part of the place.  Just a little pricey in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food is simply amazing. It's hard to believe it is fast food. The custard is to die for. The service is very good and the staff super friendly.  Will be eating here on a regular basis with the family."}
{"text":"Very fast service. Ordered at the counter, got my drink and had my food within minutes. As fast as many fast food places, but much better. The burgers are hot, juicy, & well seasoned. Cheese curds are tremendous. The staff is very friendly. Can't wait to try the frozen custard."}
{"text":"Wow, I was surprised how good this burger was.  Truthfully I tried going to In and Out but the line was around the building so I decided to give Culvers a try.  Glad I did, the burger was greasy but juicy and full of flavor.  I like that they use butter and the fries were good also.  Only mistake I made was trying to eat in the car, I quickly learned that my pants were not going unstained.  I tried coming here once before but the inside kind of smelled like Dairy Queen so I walked out.  I guess I just have to stick to the drive thru.  Ha ha"}
{"text":"I just returned from Culver's and lets just say my experience was not a good one. I will say that the place was very very clean and well kept (bravo for that). There were also nice, large TV's that were showing the football game. The two young boys working the cashier were very nice. My mom was taking quite a while to look over the menu and they asked if she had any questions etc. We ordered and went to sit down in the \"dining area\". Once we sat down there were two employees eating. I assumed they were on their lunch break or had just gotten off work and were having a bite to eat. It was a male and a female employee. The male employee was extremely rude and obnoxious. He was sitting in the booth chewing up his food and opening his mouth to show his other co workers who were all the way across the establishment behind the cash registers. Everyone who was sitting in the \"dining area\" was looking at him in disgust. You are an employee, yes you are probably 15 or 16 but really? I was so grossed out by this! The he continued to do that while laying down across the booth and flailing his arms and legs knocking into the table causing a lot of noise and a scene. I don't know who the manager is, but I don't find that acceptable at all. 

Food:
All of my midwest friends rave about this place. I honestly have no idea why. I ordered a burger. It looked nothing like what it was supposed to look like and the actual meat part of it was paper thin and crispy looking (ew). My mom ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich and they brought out something else but were very nice and responsive and brought out the correct food quickly. She didn't think the food was that great either. 

Let's just say I will not be returning, and maybe the management needs to reevaluate allowing employees to take breaks with customers, or else clean house. That is not acceptable anywhere for an employee to behave as this one did."}
{"text":"I hate to even give this location a star. Worst management and owner ever. I had a Culver's punchcard with no expiration and had several locations listed including this one . I earned a free value basket. The card might be 1 year old but no older. The manager refused to honor it , even though his location was listed. His excuse was we don't take those anymore. I said it had no expiration date and confused to why he wouldn't honor their own incentive card? He told VERY directly I should go back to the location I got it from! I sent a complaint to HQ and owner called at 9:15pm (little late for a business call) and proceeds to tell me how he agrees w/ his manager. All I can really say is WOW! I truly can't believe either of their responses and hie the handle a simple 7.00 customer meal."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick lunch before heading to Sedona. I ordered the standard burger with fries and a drink. The burger was very well seasoned and tasty. The red onion was sweet and complemented the meat well, along with the lettuce, tomato, and cheese. I was commenting to my wife that I was so glad we stopped here instead of McDonald's or the other usual fast food chains. 

A solid 4 1/2 stars!"}
{"text":"Not your average fast food joint. So we were in SC for hurricane Irma. We kept seeing these Culver's all over the place. Start reading up on it and once I saw someone compare it to In and Out Burger then I just HAD to try it.

So we decided to try it one night. It did not disappoint! Honestly I haven't been to In and Out in years so I'm not sure I can compare the two. That being said it was definitely better than any of the fast food chains we have down here in FL.

We stuck to the basic double cheese burger with fries (after ordering I realized they had cheese curds, wish I would of tried that!) I also got a chocolate milkshake. The burger was perfect and so were the fries and milkshake. They also bring it to your table which was cool. 

The place itself was also very nice, it even had a fireplace, seemed odd, but good, for a fast food place. Complete satisfaction was achieved!"}
{"text":"When it comes to the Mt. Rushmore of fast food burger joints with a drive thru you will see the signs of In n Out, Whataburger, Culver's, Steak nShake and Wendy's. These joints serve fresh beef and that is criteria #1. Shake Shack, Habit, Smashburger and Five Guys don't have drive thru and have their own separate mountain. Culver's hasn't made it to my neck of the woods but if work drops me by a location I am always going to visit. The Butterburger is one of life's little treats.  Add a slice of cheddar and you are in business. A simple burger prepared exquisitely. Fresh beef nicely griddled and seasoned, a buttered and toasted bun, a touch of mayo, pickle and red onion. Symphony.  Watch out they are generous with the onion and that can overpower. The frozen custard puts just about every ice cream I have had to shame. My advice , if you see a Culver's, pull over immediately."}
{"text":"5 stars because 

1) it's Culver's and 

2) I refuse to let an LA resident (Tracy G) weigh down the supreme awesomeness that is Culver's based on her misunderstanding of cheese curd availability!"}
{"text":"I love Culver's. This is fact.

The thing that makes this Culver's different from the rest is that they had offered Wisconsin-fare, i.e. Wisconsin Cheese Soup. Wow, was this fantastic! The facility was clean, the employees were very happy and the food was very tasty!

I'm glad that I can find quality fast-food, yet sit-down food across the nation!"}
{"text":"I grew up on the Northside *flashes nonexistent  northside hand sign* so I ate this Culver's more time than I should admit. I had some classmates work at this Culver's over the years and I have eaten many chicken tenders. Even the people who are not my friends are pretty cool cats when it comes to Service.

The managers... I have never inquired to my friends about their treatment by their supervisors so this review is based solely on my perception. They are not very nice to say the least. The two blonde ladies are grumpy gills. They don't speak fairly to their staff and make a point of being demeaning. I am not saying that staff should have a blasty blast while working, I just think it would be nice to see staff that doesn't look like they're walking on eggshells or waiting to be yelled at. 

I once had two coupons for ice cream and one of the managers told me I could only use one. Being right is as important as throwing away an ice cream cone. *shrug*"}
{"text":"Culvers signature item is the Butter Burger. The name says it all. One time, I my eyes were bigger than my stomach and I ordered the triple Butter Burger and could not eat it all. Way too much food along with a small fry and large diet coke ( I was dieting at the time! haha!) 

Seriously, besides Wendy's, Culvers is the only fast food burger joint I will eat from. Really enjoy their service whether it's drive thru or dine in. The staff, while typically high schoolers, are very nice. 

Some things to note:

1. Pop (aka soda) is typically flat regardless of what kind you get
2. Drive thru on Fridays is ridiculously long. You cannot even get into the parking lot and resort to parking across the street a the Associate Bank.
3. They Walleye Dinner is seasonal but is also their 2nd best item on the menu. 3rd would be their chicken tenders which are 100% white meat and VERY fulfilling
4. Pricey. You can easily spend $20 for two people.
5. Flavor of the day typically sucks. Sorry. It's rare that I pass by and see a flavor I want to stop and order
6. Wish they would send out more coupons. Earlier in the summer, they will send out a variety of GREAT coupons you can take advantage of such as by one burger, get the 2nd free. Love it when they dish out them coops. 
7. Not the biggest fan of their fries but they aren't bad.
8. Boring Salads. Not friendly to dieters!! Be warned. 

Culvers is a great family oriented restaurant to eat it. They are a step up from fast food in my opinion. 

Special Note:

Culvers CATERS! Yes. This is something many people do not know. Call your nearest Culvers for more information. I've used the catering services twice and both times were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Culvers is a very solid burger joint. I really like the variety of options you can choose from in the menu as well as the prices. They are a family oriented establishment and uses good quality food. I love their chicken tenders. They are 100% breast meat and totally fulfilling. If you order the basket, you get 4 tenders, fries, dipping sauce and a large drink. I can never finish my meal. Honestly, 2 tenders are enough. You'll be pretty full after this meal."}
{"text":"Burgers are better than the custard.  I'll go for a butter burger any day before I will go for the custard.  While the custard is the namesake menu item and the flavor of the day is a tempting draw, I find that they all mostly taste of artificial flavors with so-so add-in ingredients to make the flavor happen....I guess

Get a butter burger, try the custard and go for an adventure with the fired cheese curds, squeaky cheese."}
{"text":"Culver's is a have to stop for my daughter anytime there is one in the area.  We love there custard and the flavors of the day are so fun to try.  I am not a fan of there burgers, much to greasy for my liking which is why it's 4 stars and not 5"}
{"text":"Brand spanking new really great customer service there and same great food and custard it will take great willpower not to go more than a few times a month now that its so close to home"}
{"text":"This location is so hit or miss, and usually a miss. After waiting 5 minutes, in the drive thru for the car in front of me to finally get to order, the burgers are dry and pretty tasteless. The saving grace tonight was the cheese curds. Who doesn't love tasty little fried chunks of cheesy heaven. Tonight was the first time out of many trips by this store that they were actually not over cooked. Usually, they are disappointing hollow shells. Hopefully they are getting basic frying 101 down. Now, if only they'd make that delicious lemon ice a year round dessert, we'd be talking."}
{"text":"Ive been told this place is like Smashburger.  I gotta tell ya.  I like Smashburger better.   Not to say this place isn't good.  it was delicious, really it was.  But for me it was just another burger with fries and nothing that amazing.

Would I go again? Sure..  but only if friends wanted to go and I didn't feel like whining about going somewhere else. 

Do get their cheese curds.  Those were yummy."}
{"text":"After dealing with some business down the road I felt the need for a big greasy cheeseburger and ice cream to improve my day. I ordered the deluxe meal with cheese bites and a vanilla shake with oreo mixed in. Yes, I went all out on my consolation meal.

The restaurant itself is clean and the staff are very friendly. The service to get the food to my table seemed slow but I can't remember a time a fast food restaurant brought my food to me so maybe it is the norm.

The food itself, sadly, was just OK. The burger patties were thin and overpowered by the thick cheese slices and my lettuce tasted off. The shake was delicious but half the oreos were hardly mixed in leaving big cookie chunks I couldn't eat. The cheese bites were probably the best part of the meal.

Maybe I expected too much from this place because their pictures online looked amazing. The food is decent and the place is much cleaner than many other fast food places but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I like the food.  I really do.  However I can feel the happiness drain from my body when I come here.  And I am certain that it is a result of your second assistant manager Aldo.  He was on his phone when I arrived.   No smile.  No interest.  No nothing.  I ordered a large drink with my order and he replied, \"Regular?\"  I again  asked for a large and i got the same answer again.  I guess he's concerned about your paper cost.  And he was on his phone again when I left.   So thats my story.  And I'm sticking to it"}
{"text":"This Culvers has great customer service. Food is always good and consistent. We usually go through the drive thru with our two pugs and they always have dog treats on hand to give them. We've only eaten inside a couple times but each time it was very clean."}
{"text":"Great frozen custards & butter burgers, a variety of choices for food & dessert, friendly workers, clean place, a couple of flat-screen TVs, and the ONLY place we could find open on a Sunday afternoon.  

My coworker & I had just left the Phoenix airport in our rental car and were on our way to Flagstaff.  We were starving to death & decided to take a random exit in search for food.  

It was a Sunday after 4pm and why in the heck was every single friggin' eating place in this area   **CLOSED**  ....and so early...!?!?  

....NOT  Culver's,  thankfully.  

Phoenix people, what's wrong with you???  (btw, in Houston, a lot of our places close at 6pm on Sundays.)

I got a kid's meal, which comes with your choice of a main dish, a side of any choice, small drink (free refills for dine-in), and a frozen custard with 1 topping (any flavor/any topping).  

All the above was only $4.49 (plus tax).   The frozen custard is FREE with kiddie meals.  Just don't forget to use your coupon that comes on your kiddie bag or you'll lose out.

That was a really great deal & I was stuffed.   I love that you can get any side and there were so many to choose from, like coleslaw, salad, fries, mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans, onion rings, etc.

I chose the butter burger for my main dish, the coleslaw for my side, and the strawberry custard with banana slices for my dessert.  I enjoyed my whole meal.  I loved the thick & creamy custard. delish!!!  It was a decent size too for a kid's meal.

My coworker got a reuben and salad.   He enjoyed his meal too.

If I'm ever back in Phoenix, I'm asking my coworker if we can stop by here again."}
{"text":"Either someone read my previous comment, or enough people complained about it, I got both my salad dressing and sauce in the bag tonight...without even asking!  Plus the food is still dynamite."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great fries! The most friendly service that I've encountered. Their concrete mixers are made with frozen custard... Oh to die for!!!  Way better than Dairy Queen's blizzards by far!"}
{"text":"Do not leave this place without getting their ice cream (I think they call them concrete mixers) seriously delicious! One of my favorite places to go to get a nice cool treat! Customer service is great!"}
{"text":"I have tried to like this place. The awareness of the service is quite horrible. 

Driving through the drive though I like to order a fudge pecan, single scoop , without the cherry. 

First if you order this, they tell you the cost, you say thank you, there is no welcome in return. 

But then we when get to the window, they will more then 60% of the time have the cherry on top. then they say \"oh sorry\" and then remove the cherry and hand it back. The cherry juice is dripping all over the ice cream. This is incorrect service. 

it is simple, pay attention to what the customer orders and read the order off the screen.

I am done with this place. they don't care what they do, they simply don't think and don't want to face being the error. its three freaking steps. custard, hot sauce, pecans. they just go robot and add a cherry because they don't' read the computer. they input the correct order, but don't' read it, because they always screw it up.

i have seen it where as i wait at the window the lady came towards me with the cherry on top and realized she screwed up and said \"oh! sorry\" and threw it away and then went to make another one. then did it again!!! 

the managers are at fault here. they need to pay attention to the staff. if people are making mistakes they need to stop them to think about it. 

is the industry so hard to get people that they are afraid to tell them they did wrong?"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice, they have screwed up my order twice! the food is awful & the prices ridiculous!! Fish & chips missus the chips since they neglected to put them in the order, I ordered the cheese dip that was also missing, butter burger & chili for twenty dollars! I will not return!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a cheeseburger kids meal with just ketchup from the drive thru. I should have read the negative reviews of this locations drive through because when I got home I discovered they put mushrooms on my burger. Thankfully I like mushrooms, though if I wanted them I would have ordered them. And on a kids meal? What kid likes mushrooms?! Everything else about the burger was right: cheeseburger and ketchup. In a kids meal bag. With kids fries. I just don't get the mushrooms. Alas I'll eat it anyways. I suppose the solution is to literally open up your food, bun and all, to make sure it's right. Kinda ridiculous."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst location on the planet. Orders are consistently wrong, drive through staff interrupted me while ordering which led to my order being entered incorrectly and the quality of the food was very poor. 

I think that the franchise owners need to be more hands on at this location because the management certainly is not doing their job. 

Thanks for another miserable experience."}
{"text":"Basic Culver's here. Nothing fancy, just consistent and reliable fast food choices and frozen custard served with a smile. They are pretty busy from 5 - 6:30 p.m. on weekdays so be ready for a short wait. They also have $1 specials daily that vary from cheese curds to sundaes to grilled cheeses."}
{"text":"We tried a few burgers which were decent for fast food (although I would prefer Wendy's) and their milkshake which was tasty & of good consistency."}
{"text":"This review is for the frozen custard only and holy crap, yes, FIVE STARS FOR CUSTARD.

I've lived my whole life on the west coast. Do you know what we don't have nearly enough of on the west coast? Frozen Custard.

I'd spent a few summers in Illinois as a youth and my favorite nostalgic fat kid memory is eating Culver's with my aunt. My dude and I were in Tempe to run a half marathon and what better justification for eating the most calorie laden of all desserts than a 13 mile run? We had eaten a huge lunch a few hours earlier, so we only drove through for custard (yes, this was after the run, hence the desire to sit in the car and eat). I got a scoop of vanilla and a scoop of chocolate in a waffle cone. Thankfully my dude got his own because once I tasted it I was NOT sharing.

It's probably good we don't have Culver's in California. I suspect I would have some self control issues if I had all the time access to treats this delicious."}
{"text":"There's nothing quite like a tasty frozen custard and a burger with fries on a late Friday night. As one of the restaurants open after 10, we headed over for some late night snacking. I had a single scoop of the frozen custard of the day, Georgia peach, and had a bite of the patty melt. The frozen custard was delicious. It was rich, smooth, creamy, with a refreshing peach flavor and peach chunks interspersed in the custard. The patty melt was decent. There was a strong rye flavor in the bread which did distract from the rest of the ingredients in the burger though. Perhaps a double patty would be better for this type of bread.

Service was good and our order was made in a short amount of time. The dining area was spacious and clean. 

Overall a good place for a late night bite."}
{"text":"Kind of like an upscale Dairy Queen, serving frozen custard creations, burgers, fried chicken, and anything else frozen or fried.  Their burgers are known as Butterburgers since they are thin patties cooked with a pat of butter.  I had some cherry cheesecake concrete and cheese curds.  The concrete was good, and was thick and rich, with chunks of cheesecake and small bits of cherry (more chunks of cherry would have been nice, but it still tasted great).  I wasn't a big fan of the cheese curds.  They are basically like a mini version of a mozzarella stick, battered and fried.  The cheese itself was a bit salty and I got tired of eating them after the 5th cheese curd."}
{"text":"Fast food with friendly Midwestern style service. They offer your typical fare with burgers, chicken, and fish options, and also have shakes and frozen custard. I like how they have a flavor of the day for their custards, and that you can check to see what it is on their website. 

Each time I've been here food has been consistent and fast. The interior itself is clean and the seats are comfortable. For those that don't have a lot of time for lunch and want a filling meal, this is your place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick burger or tasty frozen desserts this is a really good place. A lot of people like the cheese curds, it does sound weird but they're not bad. I wouldn't recommend the salads there was one occasion where I was sick following eating the salads.
If you sign up for their club on their website you'll get emailed a coupon for a Bogo basket. Additionally, if you subscribe to their text messages they send once every couple weeks an offer. This is an example:
CULVERS PROMO ALERT: Buy 1-Get 1 Free Culver's Double Deluxe Sandwich. Valid today only (1/18) and only at WDeerVlly 1 free offer per text member."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. I ordered a peach shake, expecting yummy peach deliciousness. What I got was a vanilla shake, with a few peach chunks in it. Bland, flavorless and a total waste of money..."}
{"text":"Love this custard. Its really one of the ONLY places in Phoenix for Custard. Amazing here in AZ there is no good ice cream to be found. I am definitely a fan or culvers however its not super close to my home. I love love love the Turtle Sundae."}
{"text":"I don't discriminate when it comes to fast food, I'll try just about anywhere/ eat anything.. but Culver's was yucky! The buffalo chicken tenders were dry and lacked in flavor. I have enjoyed Culver's custard for years but only ever order the cheese curds to match. They did not win me over in the food dept. I will never return to this location. Yikes! 
Also, we can't get over how expensive our drive thru meal was: cheese curds and 8count tender meal turns into $18? Double Yikes!!"}
{"text":"Order cheese curds.  The food is so good here.  If you can I would avoid lunch time because it's so busy."}
{"text":"Food - Good, Fries - Yummy, Cheese Curds - OMG!, Ice Cream - Amazing, Customer Service - Super Cool, Restaurant - Clean"}
{"text":"Always pleased with the staff and service at this location. Different flavors of creamy, frozen custard every day with some of the freshest food to be served through a drive through window. From butter burgers,  Rubens, fish sandwiches and multiple dinner choices  (pot roast, fish and chips, etc) all accompanied with a side. Fries, mashed potatoes, cheese curds, side salad, etc. Take a number & they'll bring the food to you! Always a solid choice for an evening short on time"}
{"text":"I honestly can comment much on their food because I have not eaten here much and the only thing I have ever ordered from here was their cheese curds which by the way is AMAZING! This place is right by where I live so we drive thru for cheese curds when we want a quick snack and a drink. This last time we went after our trip to the dog park so we had our dogs with us and the driver thru cashier was so nice to our dog and gave him some dog treats! Now my boyfriend has had their cheeseburgers and he did think they were good."}
{"text":"I'm very tough in grading just because I know quality and I know how my food should taste, fries are mushy not the best and the food in general doesn't look as appetizing as it does in the pictures way far from it, it barely had any lettuce the cheese isn't melted ? I mean I would prolly give it another chance with  another meal"}
{"text":"We stopped off the interstate for a quick decent dinner and that is what we got.  Two kids cheese sandwich meals, a chicken sandwich, and I broke rank and got the 2 piece chicken dinner with green beans,slaw and a bun.  Everyone was happy and the service and turn around was faster than our local Culver's which was nice!  I was really happy with the fried chicken (two thighs), it was crisp and moist!"}
{"text":"I had never tried a Culver's until trying this one and it is really awesome, especially for semi-fast food.  The burgers appear to be good quality fresh meat.  The cheese curds are awesome and of course the custard is good too.  It is a little pricier than your typical fast food, but worth the price."}
{"text":"I had never been in a Culver's until yesterday and I thought the salad I had, was very good.  When you go in, you go to the counter and place your order and then they bring it out to your table. We didn't have to wait that long for our order either.  It is a very nice and clean restaurant and all the people are very friendly.  When we left the restaurant, their marquee showed \"Pork Tenderloin\" sandwiches.  You have no idea how excited I was.  There are very few places in Phoenix that have this type of sandwich, which is mainly served in the Midwest, so I am elated.  I didn't realize there were so many Culver Restaurants in the area and because of Yelp, I see there is one even closer to where I live, besides this particular location.  I highly recommend this restaurant and am very happy they came to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Reminds me of back east in Michigan. Maybe it was the overcast skies and the cool weather, or maybe it was the crowd gathered for the lunch rush, whatever it was it took me home. This place was a much bigger version of a small town burger joint. I will be back, just not at noon! Two words: controlled chaos. 
The food is good, but don't get that confused with good for you! Because oh boy, it is so not. But it was really very tasty! I had the basic deluxe burger, fries and a drink. My son ordered the chicken strips and fries. The kids meal comes with a frozen custard so I was able to steal a few bites.........sorry kid!  It was so rich and creamy, just how it should be. Friendly, quick and clean are all on the menu here! I would go back again after I run 10 miles to burn off those fries!!"}
{"text":"The cheese curds here are so good!  I like to just get an order of those because they are delicious.  I really like the concretes that they have here, they are really good too.  The employees are always very nice and greet you when you walk through the door, which is great since you don't get that at most fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Great onion rings! The burger I got (mushroom and Swiss) was pretty good too. It didn't blow my mind but it was satisfying. But the let down was the milkshake. I saw reviews that made their ice cream and shakes sound Godly. Yeah, no. Great service and onion rings though"}
{"text":"Pretty good restaurant. I think I liked the root beer there the most. Got the sour dough sandwich and added some thousand island on it and it was pretty amazing. A little heavy on the grease though. My friends sandwich was a lot greasier though. Fries are nothing to write home about. Just basic crinkle cut fries and the onion rings were lack luster too. Got myself a pint of the mint oreo frozen custard to take home and try. Overall has a good atmosphere. Good for large crowds and kids and you are able to really make anything unique and to your liking."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Tasty burger, good drink and custard selection. Good prices. Would return any time. Even got a free custard with check-in. Thanks Yelp!!!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to this fast food place. The staff is always polite and helpful. The food is fresh and tasty. The restaurant is clean. It is right by the freeway and so very convenient. Their custard is delicious!"}
{"text":"After having dinner down the road this is the place to go to put out the fire. Heath cheesecake mixer."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would... we went through the drive through ordered two burgers and two cheese curds.. pretty simple order I would say....They gave us our number and we waited with everyone else in line to get our food. Pretty ridiculous system if you ask me... 20 minutes go by and all the cars behind us which was was about 5 ...ALL got there food before us!! So I go inside to speak to a \"manager\" if that's what you want to call him and I tell him what is going on and tell him id like a refund.. he doesn't seem to care that I am upset and he offers me free custard which I don't think is appropriate for how long we just had to wait for our food. I told him I wanted a refund and he then proceeded to ask me what we got, which I told him..and then mentioned that it's ridiculous that we waited 20 minutes to get our food while everyone else behind us got there food first. Again, doesn't seem to care at all...He goes over to look to see when the order was placed because apparently he didn't believe that I waited that along and then comes back and said to me \"it just hit the 20 minute mark and that I've been standing here for about 4 of those minutes\"!!! Really?!! Is this really how you are going to speak to a customer! This place has the worst customer service especially when the so called manager tries to argue with me and then still doesn't do anything about my unhappiness. If he is the manager then he should be fired... that is very poor to treat your customers like that! I will be calling corporate because I feel like the way I was treated and how everything was handled was unacceptable. I do not recommend this place to anyone... the food and service are both horrible!"}
{"text":"Very fast! Great cheese curds but super disappointed with the concrete mixer. 80% vanilla ice cream and then 20% fudge and caramel. Couldn't really taste the fudge and caramel just all vanilla ice cream. Would of been better saving some money and just getting a vanilla soft serve. Sorry but DQ knows what they are doing, take notes."}
{"text":"It's good food. It's fresh food. It's fast food.
Good 'ol Midwestern recipes make they're way to the South! You just can't beat the fried cheese curds. Ery'body needs cheese in their life...

Culver's has something for everyone. Chicken, butter burgers, beef, pork, salads and of course cheese curds and delicious ice cold cream ... better affectionately known as ice cream. You scream, I scream, We all scream for ... a concrete mixer! 'Merica!!

The most recent visit, they were very busy at lunch time. Yep, it was summer and yep, they're located near the popular NC/SC amusement park. So, with that said, it took quite some time to get our meals. But, it came out piping hot and correct! The come around looking for your specific numbered table flag that is given out after paying up front.

They have your standard fountain drink machine, including Culver's own Root Beer! Yum!
Don't forget to try the pork tenderloin sandwich! It's a Midwestern staple!

it's all a bit pricey, but it's tasty."}
{"text":"Back in the day, if you wanted to go out for a burger, you pretty much only had McDonald's and Burger King. Sure, you could get a burger at plenty of other places, but they were just different.

Then along came Five Guys and Shake Shack and Smashburger and their variants. And of course if you were on the west coast, you had In and Out and the like. Now you have more of the midwest dairy style, like Culver's and Freddy's.

The primary driver here is certainly the burger - it's something like the smashed style of Smashburger, being that it's not large - but even better is that you can get custard too. And at Culver's, you can even find cheese curds. Nice.

When it comes to the burger, you can get about anything you want on it, and when it comes to desert, it's about the same. Just make sure you order it on hold - that way you don't have to sit there waiting on it for later. You get a receipt that you simply hand them later and they'll make it for you when you're ready and you can eat your burger (and curds) while it's hot, and you get your custard cold. Best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Culver's is an interesting beast - while fast food, they are a slightly different take on fast food, so it's not your standard BK or McDonald's. More akin to a Freddy's, if you're familiar. It's not at the level of Five Guys or Smashburger, however, because they are definitely shooting for the drive-through crowd, rather than the sit down variety (though you are welcome to sit).

It is a nice variety because they have things you won't see elsewhere, like cheese curds (mmm... cheese), but beyond the fact that you have a few different menu choices, there isn't really much different here.

If you're in the are, stocking up on cheap gas or booze or coming back from Carowinds, it's worth a try, but probably not worth driving across town."}
{"text":"We were immediately greeted upon entering, which is always nice.  The food was delivered to our table promptly and they have sweet tea!  Extra thumbs up for all those things!  The cheese curds are a little salty but otherwise the food is delish!"}
{"text":"I love Culver's, grew up in Wisconsin and was so excited when it opened!  The staff at this location is awesome"}
{"text":"Taste of the mid west! No wonder the heartland is over weight! Lol"}
{"text":"Yummo! The butter burger is the best fast food burger in town. The concrete mixers (like Bluzzards but 100% better) and sundaes are wonderful. The frozen custard is way better than soft serve."}
{"text":"This fast food restaurant is way over priced. Ordered a chicken tender basket and one very small scoop of ice cream and it cost over 12.00! The 4 chicken tenders were fake chicken, tiny package of fries and a drink. I could have gotten much better quality of food and much cheaper at McDonald's or Wendys for half the price. Also it took for ever for them to make my order."}
{"text":"We celebrated national farmers day at this culvers this last Thursday, October 12 our Wisconsin Interest Group from Sun City Grand. We were about 40 or so people and we received excellent service. And of course the food was yummy. Our large group was outside on the picnic tables. The manager came out several times to check and asked. He was awesome. Thank you Culver's Surprise Arizona"}
{"text":"I've driven past Culver's a ton of times, and we decided to stop in for dessert after having sushi down the street. The inside is very bright and clean and the cashiers were nice and helpful. I had a mini frozen custard with brownie and fudge which was delightful. I do want to come back and try their butter burgers"}
{"text":"Wow! A custard lovers paradise. In the cold case they even had butter brickle flavored custard! My all-time favorite flavor and rarer than hens teeth. I know this because I always search for this flavor whenever I'm near ice cream or custard. Culvers delivers too on the creamy, smooth, flavor in their chocolate yogurt and the price won't break the bank.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Is it really so hard to get an ice cream order right?  Apparently it is for Culver's. I've yet to ever order anything from here that they didn't screw up. I've even had them argue with me that the receipt was wrong and what they gave me was right. Don't waste your time with this place unless you like being surprised with what you'll get."}
{"text":"Let's be clear, this review is just for the raspberry frozen custard. It isn't fancy or homemade but it was so good I ate one portion and then went through the drive thru to get a second one. Now, that downside of daily flavors is now I have to wait a month to get the precious raspberry flavor again. That's ok, I'll wait!"}
{"text":"For a fast food burger, this place is TOPS! Far superior to In'n'Out, which seems to be what a lot of people choose to compare it with. I guess it's like the whole Coke vs. Pepsi thing, except with burgers. And my choice is obvious. Tons of choices for toppings and condiments, fries are crinkle-style and tasty, and the selection of deserts is almost too much! Fresh food, friendly service, clean dining room and restrooms. Food takes a little longer than say, McDonald's, but it's well worth the extra minute. Give it a try, I think you'll be impressed."}
{"text":"They don't have these in Cali so thought I would try it out as just another fast food burger place. When I pulled up I was plesantly surprised to see they had an extensive menue all kinds of fried food and milk shake options. I ended up ordering some chicken tender, waffel fries, with a milk shake. I gotta say it was just ok nothing too crazy but glad I tried it."}
{"text":"What can I say? Culvers is my favorite place for burgers and this location has to be the best of them all!

The staff is always smiling, managers are always complimenting the staff and encouraging, it's just a great atmosphere to eat in.

Also, their drive through has NEVER messed up an order for me! That alone would make me a fan!

Clean, happy staff, happy customers! Great job!"}
{"text":"Ok so I thought I would give the place a try... Got a double Swiss mushroom burger , onion rings and chocolate shake... Well I went thur the drive thru no one there so I thought I would be in and out pretty quick... The wait time wasn't to bad, got my order and preceded to leave, I stuck my hand in the bag and what do ya know..no onion rings...so now I have to inconvenience myself and go in and get  what should have been there in the first place...

So I get to my destination to eat my meal and let's just say I have had a much better burger for the money... I mean no letter, onion, tomato or sauce really???? I payed over $11 dollars for this meal for two hamburger patties and some cheese ???? Really....oh wait there was suppose to be mushrooms on it too but I didn't see much of them either..

The onion rings, standard onion rings you could get at burger king...the shake was good but everything else,well not so good ...


I won't spend that kind f money on fast food drive thru, I will go to Red Robin where they know how to make a real meal..."}
{"text":"Butter buns..ummm..passed this time!  I tried the pot roast dinner.  Not bad.  The meat was tender and the side portion of mash potatoes and greens were good.  The dining room was full of  families.  There's something for everyone from burgers, cheese curds, shakes, sundaes to pot roast and fried chicken. If you have kids, check this place out! Clean, good food and the staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"LOVE. THIS. PLACE.

First tried this place on my drive cross-country and it was very good. I raved about the burger to everyone for a very long time.

By chance, when I was visiting home in the south, I spotted that culver's sign out of the corner of my eye and proceeded to flip out. My passenger in the car was baffled at my sudden excitement. 

On the way back from my primary destination, I stopped here and my friend and I were in burger & shake heaven."}
{"text":"This Culver's is one of the worst we've been to. 1st. They didn't deliver our drink correctly when we asked for no ice. So they took the drink back and gave us a different drink with no ice, not even the drink we ordered. And worst of all, the girl took her finger to wipe off the lid for our concrete and and licked it before handing it to us. Pretty sure that's a health code violation?"}
{"text":"Don't do the drive thru!!  Over 10 minutes for a lousy cheeseburger and shake. And the shake was melted by the time we got the burger."}
{"text":"Regular retail price ~$14. Paid $8. Eating at Culver's can be pricey, but ever since I explored the kid's menu it's been a little easier on my pocket book. Saved 10 Scoopie coupons (on the kid's meal bag) to earn a free meal! Also the bag comes with a free scoop of custard! This is the best deal Culver's has hands down  Dine in and the difference in the size of your cup won't matter because it's self serve free refills. The food is always hot and fresh, but the employees aren't - somebody needs to cheer these guys up!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through and the service was fast. The down sides were that the person working the speaker did not hear or understand my order the first time around and even though I pulled forward to wait for my food my fries were just kind of warm instead of piping hot like I'm used to with order Culver's locations."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Culver's open up right by where I live. I haven't had it since I moved out here from the Midwest. Their chicken tenders are the best and I always get them. You really can't get them anywhere else. They're super juicy but crispy at the same time. 

However, I'm going to be unbiased and write my review for this location only.

The food, as I mentioned before, was great and just like what I remembered. The service and atmosphere, that's another story. I understand that they just opened very recently so they probably still have some training/kinks to work on. I'll definitely be back and will update my rating if they deserve it. 

Strike one, the first thing you notice when you walk in is the stench. It smelled like a mixture of rotten eggs and a gas station restroom. I noticed it was really bad where you order your food and wasn't so bad in the seating area. They really need to work on their ventilation or something. It's really hard to enjoy your food when you have to smell that. 

Strike two, when I received my food, I noticed that I was given regular fries instead of sweet potato fries. I told the person who brought them to me that I had ordered the sweet potato fries. She walked off with my food and her attitude. She came back a little later and asked if I was sure if I ordered the sweet potato fries because on the ticket, it didn't say that I ordered them and apparently it's a dollar extra for sweet potato fries. Umm, yes I'm sure I know what I ordered. And really? A dollar for sweet potato fries? Most restaurants just sub the two. Either way, it was clearly their mistake and she could have been more accommodating or just gave me the sweet potato fries and lost a dollar. I was with a bunch of my coworkers who had never gone before and I was really excited for them to try it out. The service we got did not leave the best taste in their mouths. They also got a few other orders wrong but we didn't say anything because we already saw how unhelpful they were with me. 

Strike three, some of us went back up to the counter to order dessert and cheese curds because no one had them before and wanted to try them out. The man who brought us the desert took our number holder and we pointed out to him that we had more food coming too and he said, \"I just do the desserts.\" That's kind of a weird system and seems very inefficient. Why wouldn't you just bring one cement mixer and one cheese curd out at the same time? He finally understood that we still needed the number on our table for our other food and left. 

This one girl also kept coming by as we were waiting for our food asking if we needed anything else. Um, our food? But really, what else would we need? It was really awkward that she kept asking since everything is pretty much self served.

So overall, their food is really good and I'm so glad they opened near me. Their service on the other hand sucked. Hope they fix it soon!"}
{"text":"This place is waaay underrated.

 The food is always fresh and staff very friendly. I love to get their value baskets and their dinners. Legit."}
{"text":"I've been to many Culvers and this was a regular store. Service was usual speed and food was good. I would return if I was in this town again."}
{"text":"The standard Culvers. I've been here a few dozen times with mixed reviews. The food is always the same (good) The bathrooms are hit and miss if they are clean, seating can be tough during busy times, they seem to be always out of mayo."}
{"text":"This place was filthy dirty gross. Crap all over the tables, grease on the floor. Employees seemed nonplussed and I probably would too if I was only making $7.80 an hour. 

My chicken was soggy and the butter burger tasted like it had seen better days.  Yuck."}
{"text":"As a born and raised Minnesotan - Culver's is something I have loved since my childhood.  This location is the superior option in the Charlotte area (the one next to IKEA has messed our order up every visit).  The service is outstanding!  After a recent trip to Carowinds on my birthday we stopped at Culver's for dinner.  The food was awesome as usual but we had an unusual experience while we were eating.  The manager (perhaps the owner?) asked us if we wouldn't mind standing up from our seats because a kid had redeemed their points and wanted a soccer ball.  I guess they were stored in the booth seats.  No problem! But he offered us a free dish of ice cream for our \"trouble\".  I told my fiancé we didn't need it but JUST IN CASE... asked him to check the flavor of the day.  Thank goodness we did!  They were featuring my favorite flavor from childhood that I had given up on ever having again!  I was so pumped!  It made my birthday! 

Side note: they do an amazing veggie burger here if you happen to be a vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Always fresh, delicious food and friendly staff. Employees are very helpful to new comers and have great product knowledge. Any issues are solved with urgency and quickly. They are always willing to go out of their way for customers. If you visit you must try their Fresh Frozen Custard."}
{"text":"Customer service is the key for me.  These people here are very nice. I always get the chopped steak dinner. And the desserts? Don't get me started.  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Fast food is not good for our health. Yes, this is true.

Culver's is not ordinary fast food.  Once in a while I just have to cut loose and have a juicy, cheesy, hamburger and french fries, and Culver's is the BEST!  

While in Phoenix I was looking for a quick meal between meetings.  When I saw Culver's (normally just in the Midwest?), I turned in to the parking lot on a dime.  It's Culver's!!!!

Delish.  Five stars."}
{"text":"this place is great. good burgers. good fries. good ice cream.

Need I say more?

Oh yeah, their service is unparalleled by any other burger joint."}
{"text":"Review is for desert only. A group of 5 of us happened in here looking for something cold. We were all super impressed. We live in LA and hope they open in our area. A great find."}
{"text":"Oh Culver's how I love you!  I don't know if you know this but we have a special connection; your first location is in my hometown.  Even though I've moved away, I've not forgotten you.  Our reunion this weekend was bittersweet; the delicious chicken tenders and french fries...if only I'd had a chocolate custard ice cream cone...oh well, it will give me an excuse to stop in the next time that I'm home. 

I hope that you know how special you are; after all, you're the only fast-food restaurant that can make me forget that I've read Fast Food Nation and Omnivore's Dilemma...a pretty significant accomplishment."}
{"text":"I usually love Culver's.  It is good quality for fast food.  On this occasion the food was cold and the burger looked like it was thrown together."}
{"text":"I am going to stop spending my money here.  The Custard is great, the food is average to below, and the counter help could care less if you were there or not.  Spoke to the owner once and I get why the place is this way.  He was frustrated that I would call and tell him about my horrible  experience there after he had just fired all 4 of his mangers and half his staff.  Seems to me that maybe its not the Managers faults, but the training they get from above.  Anyway...not for me any more.  I bet I spent  250 a month there for the last 18 months.  How many other people who dont take the time to write a review has this poorly run restaurant driven off?  Good Luck, I  will not be back."}
{"text":"I love Culvers because it reminds me of home.  The food is usually very good and who can say anything bad about Custard.  

My problem is with Culvers all over the Valley and not just this one. Employees, when you are at work, please be at work.  The last three times I have been at Culvers, I know the employees would rather be anywhere else than where they were. They have not listened to me, they constantly ask again and again what I want, they get interrupted by other employees which takes them back to square 1 cause they forget what they were doing.  Tonight I was handed off between two employees for my order.  One of the employees had never run the register before, and he was interrupted several times.  Of course my order was not correct, even after starting over 3 times to get it right.  The kid was trying, he just didnt have the training to be where he was.   Just a poor way to run a register.  I can get a burger anywhere, and probably will from now on.  Custard is making its appearance in Phoenix finally and I will have other places to go for that also.  Culvers Management, your employees need training.  They need to know that when they are working, they need to be with the Customer, treat us with respect, LISTEN TO US, and get our orders right.  Get this message out, your employees, this is not a part time job after school and you do not have to work hard.  Culvers has a good reputation all over the US.  People in Phoenix/Scottsdale can shop anywhere for food like this.  Make the experience pleasant and memorable for the right reasons and people will come back.  When they come back, you will continue to have a job.  I have no reason to come back now until it gets hot and custard is on my mind.   Give me a reason to come back for other things...."}
{"text":"Your food is always consistent.  It is good.  Burgers good, Concretes good. Blonde HS girl taking orders was good and thorough when taking my order.  BUT!!!!!!  Rudeness started when I went to the window to pay.  Lots of activity at the drive thru with all the other employees.  I was told my balance, and handed this Blonde HS cashier girl my card.  She ran it, but then, was talking to all the others at the window, and just stuck her arm out the window with my card.  No thnak you, no eye contact, just the left arm out the window looking the other direction talking to the others.  VERY RUDE!   Then my concrete came out, and she did the same thing.  just stuck it out the window, and kept her conversation going with the others.  HI Blonde HS cashier, I am your customer, in other words, I am your boss.  I pay your wages, I keep you in business and you damn well better start paying attention to me instead of trying to figure out what dress you are going to wear at Homecoming.   Manager/Owner, I realize this is a problem with hiring children to do this job, but they are on the front lines of your business.  You better train them right.  I can eat at 100s of different places and I chose yours tonight, and now will not choose you again for a long long time."}
{"text":"Ok currently car number 3 waiting for food and two cars behind me WTF this butter burger better be BOMB lol"}
{"text":"I rarely ever eat fast food, but then sometimes get a craving and am pleased to find something a little more like real food than the typical Burger King/McDonald's variety.  Along comes Culver's, the perfect place to roll through the drive through for an instant reward to my junk food craving of the moment.

Thinking that I'd probably have to settle on a greasy burger and fries if I didn't want a bland chicken sandwich and typical fast food salad, I was pleased to find pork tenderloin sandwiches on the menu (the other white meat that you can dunk in grease and fry) along with a range of sides.  My wife grabbed a frozen custard, I got the pork tenderloin with cole slaw, and  we both went away happy with our classic fast food selections.

Don't get me wrong, this place is nothing that I'd rave endlessly about, but it does fill a huge void in its segment and I'd argue it's probably far superior to places like In N Out, with its slightly broader (yet not overwhelming) selection and what appeared from the car to be a much more thoughtful seating layout.  Not only that, but I don't think you need to believe in Jesus to order the fries here (no bible verses on the packaging).  A little religion doesn't hurt while clogging your arteries, but Culver's was homey and family style without appearing to take sides on such a big non-fast food related issue as religion.  I'm a believer."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get frozen custard! Yummo! Some of my favorite sweet treats are the Turtle Sundae and the Concrete Mixers with pieces of chocolate and brownie mixed in. This place is also my favorite for their fries and buffalo chicken sandwich. The cashiers are generally very friendly and you get your food quickly. Once you order, they give you a number to display on your table and you go find your seat either in the restaurant or on the patio (they also have a drive thru). The drawback with this is the customers carrying out get the same treatment and the area in front of the cash registers can get a little crowded. I don't have rootbeer that often but theirs is some of the best. If you're an ice cream fan and haven't tried their custard, you really should stop in sometime."}
{"text":"Everything here is nasty except anything with ice-cream. Their burgers are sad and doesn't taste good. Its so greasy but bland. The ice cream, on the other hand, are tasty."}
{"text":"I've been there many times and never ever had an issue with the food. But tonight.... What the heck happened to burgers to go?! This is ridiculous. Soggy and flat.... I hope next time will be as before or I'll find some other place to go get a good burger."}
{"text":"We're on a low carb diet and they were able to accommodate that. Then when my boyfriend dropped his burger out of its lettuce wrap they replaced it for free. I always loved their food, now I have to praise their service too!"}
{"text":"Culver's is a decent fast food chain that serves above average quality fast food for an above average fast food price. The burgers are comparable to other great fast food chains, such as Five Guys and Wendy's. This location is super convenient as it's right next to West Towne Mall, and the service was good and fairly quick. 

The frozen custard is probably one of Culver's biggest selling points! Definitely try it if you haven't gotten it before. I've tried both their burgers and the chicken strips, and I would highly recommend their burgers over their other options."}
{"text":"I go to this Culver's regularly and I have never had a bad experience. The employees there have awesome cutomer service. Especially Maury and Megan."}
{"text":"Service with a smile, sparkling clean facility and good fresh food! The butter burger is definitely a nice change from other burgers. The crunchy surface of the beef patty is both very flavorful and adds a nice textural contrast to the tender center and the soft buttery bun. The fries are fresh and crispy, and I look forward to trying some of the other sides which looked so good on other tables. The seating outside is nice when the weather allows."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of trash food. It was disgusting. We ended up throwing our food out because the burgers were so greasy and the cheese curds were still frozen in the middle. The custard had a weird, slimy consistency. The fries tasted like freezer burn. Wow, fast food has hit a new low with this place! Never again."}
{"text":"Tasty! Fresh! Quality food! Friendly atmosphere! Their chicken tenders are really tender! Be sure to try the cheese curds made from Wisconsin cheese."}
{"text":"I guess we had been \"built-up\" too much for this new restaurant on Greenfield in Mesa. There was TONS of teenage help, but the service was SLOW for as many staff as they had. My son wanted something else after he tried the Pot Roast sandwich, but when he ordered, it was wrong TWICE. I had to go up and find a \"Manager\" who looked to be at least one year older than the rest to try and straighten it out. It took some time to get it right, but finally they wrapped their heads around it. A LARGE amount of grab-ass was going on between the girls and boys and the young man handling our food kept throwing it in the window and then retrieving it again, just to give it a harder toss to see if he could get the lid of the contained to pop open??? If you don't expect much, you probably won't be disappointed. Very standard fast food and service. The sides on my 2 pc cod dinner were cold and not appealing at all. We didn't get ice cream, but hear that it is good. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"On the way back from a roadtrip to the Grand Canyon.  And one of our friends told us that if we were stopping in Phoenix we needed to try Culver's.  We did and it was good.  Although all we got was the frozen custard and the butter burger these things both lived up to the hype.  Anytime we see a Culver's we'll most definitely stop to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Ahhh Culver's...why must you be directly on my way home from my hot, sweaty community garden work, tempting me with your raspberry lemon ice smoothie deliciousness? And if that isn't bad enough, you have those hot, salty, fluffy inside/crispy outside fries. You know I'm weak, so here's my wallet, just take what you need. I'll see you again in a few days, my summer love."}
{"text":"FInally, a little taste of Wisconsin has come to the valley! I remember two things about Culvers from my days in the north woods: it's really unhealthy and really tasty. So when I saw they had opened up in my neighborhood, I just kept on driving.

It turns out that the menu isn't as unhealthy as I thought. It's still a variety of fast food (though definitely more high quality), but with a little planning you can find some good choices on the menu. The pot roast sandwich and mashed potatoes without gravy is less than 500 calories.

Suffice it to say, I've only had the pot roast sandwich and plain mashed potatoes at this Culvers. Both are excellent. The pot roast has a fantastic flavor and always tastes fresh. The mashed potatoes are smooth and creamy. You won't even miss the gravy."}
{"text":"First visit, last visit. Staff was friendly, store was clean, so far, so good.
Menu was impressive, lots of variety but I went with the Butter cheese burger and the wife had a mushroom/swiss burger. The patty is so thin, I think the tomato slice was twice as thick. The burger itself was almost flavorless, the lettuce was the only thing I could taste. My wife was similarly unimpressed with her sandwich.
On the plus side, the fries were hot,  crispy on the outside and creamy inside, could have used a pinch of salt though."}

{"text":"I had the absolute WORST experience at your Fort Mill, SC location. The Mama D, is rude and has a nasty attitude. I sat in the drive thru waiting area for 20 minutes (after waiting for 15 minutes in the drive thru line to order). When I went inside to ask about my order (2 chicken tender baskets) I found out the order never went through even though I had already paid. I never received an apology or an offer of a refund (which most restaurants will do if a customer had waited that long). The fry cook said she dropped the tenders when she saw the order but never got a ticket. The manager wanted to give me food that had been sitting for over 20 minutes. When I insisted on fresh food she got an attitude and refused to look and/or speak to me. She handed to food to an employee to give to me. When I asked another employee for the contact information for HQ, the employee did not know and asked Mama D. She told her I could go look it up myself. I have NEVER been treated that way in any dining establishment. I had been looking forward to Culver's all day as we were visiting Carowinds and do not have a Culver's locally. After the way I was treated I do not want to dine at ANY Culver's Restaurant. Managers like this can ruin the reputation of restaurants/chains. I would advise anyone who asks NOT to dine at that Culver's and especially not that location."}

{"text":"We ordered a salted caramel, crunch concrete mixer and a cookies and cream, whipped cream concrete mixer. It was made with custard so it was definitely creamy in texture. I would try it again if it were convenient but probably wouldn't drive out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location since it opened and this is the first time I've ever had a problem. Long story short one star because of the way Todd the manager handled the situation. He made no effort to remedy the problem and I was not trying to get anything for free. In all honesty he could not be bothered and he certainly didn't seem to care.
Poor management and they really need to do a better job of training the cashiers.

Not returning to this location. Ever."}
{"text":"I love Culver's, and coming from Wisconsin, this place made me feel at home. However, I just felt like their service is not up to par. I spent almost $25, and they of course forgot some of my items. I didn't notice until I got home. So, when I tried to call their phone to let them know, it rang a few times and went to voicemail. It's saddening when one of my favorite places can't even answer the phone. I probably won't be going back for a while because apparently no one is running the place. The food is great, but when the service is terrible, I'd rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Meh the burger is ok unless you like saturated butter on the bun and burger, felt super gross after eating it. I think they could do away with buttering the buns or meat. Ice cream is good which I probably think is the best thing there. You're better off going to In-N-Out burger, simple but great at the same time, without all the fancy overloads."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I visited, service was excellent. The store was clean also the restrooms."}
{"text":"I didn't hear about Culver's until a co-worker took us to lunch a few months ago. I had no idea it even existed until then! Anyways, over all, I liked it here, but here's a few bullet points I noticed while eating here today.

* the place is really clean, well stocked, and the staff was friendly.  I needed a few minutes to decide what I wanted despite there being a small line at the register area.

*they actually have a decent menu with fair pricing and I liked that they had a variety of food to choose from.  

*they seem to have a great selection of ice cream, which is cool! 

But, they seem to be a Christian themed type resturant.  I don't mind it, but I haven't been to a place like this in a while.  Just wanted to notate that!  They also have TV's in here as well, which is pretty cool.  I love watching the flatscreens while I wait for (and eat) my food!

Overall, I liked my food. I went with the burger and fries, and it was a okay.  I will probably return here in the future, and i usually hit it when I'm done hanging out at the library, which is how  I ended up here in the first place! Gotta love it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my hubby today for lunch.

I had the walleye fish sandwich with mashed potatoes.  Both were quite tasty.  Normally they just have cod, but they have the walleye on special right now.  The potatoes were good as well.

In the past I've had the mushroom swiss burger which is quite good, but one thing I never enjoy here are the french fries.  They just are not crisp enough - it's not location specific, it is just how they make them here."}
{"text":"For fast food, I do like this Culver's. The drive thru tends to run pretty slow and you are asked to pull ahead (with a number) to wait for your food. There have been many times that it would have been quicker for me to run into the restaurant to get our order (vs the drive thru). I've had the burgers (yum!), fresh salads, fish sandwich and (of course!) the ice cream here. All trips would rate about a 4 stars for me (on my fast food rating scale). I love that they have a flavor of the day. And, there $1 waffle cones are worth a stop and they are full of delicious ice cream. It's kind of a difficult location to get to (on the frontage road off the beltline). I love their team scoopie meals for the kids. If you are in the drive thru, you can get your kiddie sundae as you order, you just have to let them know. Their french fries and cheese curds are the bomb! Just saying."}
{"text":"I am changing my review. When we went to Culver's is was there opening week and they had some issues. They are on track now."}
{"text":"What a Culver's.  Perfect one day, not quit perfect the next. 

Thankfully the custard is always great. Especially with a $1 special normally custard, weekly. The place is clean but not as polished compared to other Culver's.   Can't wait to see the update on this locations.

Service is OK, but nothing stands out. No wows but no negativity either. They sure are a busy place. 

Bonus they are open until midnight seven days a week. So when you need your custard fix they're open for you."}
{"text":"Have had one thing here and have returned multiple times for it.

Pumpkin Pecan Concrete Mixer

Sweet pumpkin goodness and their custard is great. It has the right amount of pumpkin, pumpkin spice, and is filled with whole high quality Pecans.

Freaking YUM"}
{"text":"Culver's has good food and a nice menu selection.  Their custard is great, too."}
{"text":"When you go to the drive thru they give you a hang tag and ask you to pull around the building and they will bring your order to you.  There is nothing more irritating to me than to be told to pull up at the drive thru.  The  burger was very good it certainly made up for the wait.  The burger was just made and was great."}
{"text":"Breaded pork tenderloin sandwiches are very good. Being originally from Iowa, BPT sandwiches are a rarity here in Arizona. Onion rings and French fries are great, also. Frozen custard is delicious. What more can I say. Great job!"}
{"text":"It's fast food.  Yea!  Just what Verrado needed - and \"so Verrado!\"  It's a family-owned business, with a sincere dedication to providing a varied menu and hometown service.  A perfect fit for our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Really good stuff!! The custard was great! I loved it and when I am back in the old USA I can only hope I will cross paths with another culvers.

You know what the thing is with culvers? You actually don't need that much, it's sort of like eating cake batter or cookie dough. You can only have so much before you start getting that sickly feeling and start stirring that plastic spoon around and staring down the custard and wondering why you dont wanna finish. Yeah it's custard and it's heavy especially when you add every kind of peanut butter chocholate bar to the mix.Let me tell you those first five spoonfuls are pure goodness then it goes downhill. Less is more with this stuff let me tell you! Next time I am getting the smallest size, and I will be far more pleased and not guilty I threw out a mega size bucket. Hahaha!"}
{"text":"I had another butter burger with cheddar and you know what, its pretty good. They are certainly better than that shit known as In n Out. The fries are actually very good as well. I am a fan."}
{"text":"I realize I'm going against the grain with this review, but,  do we really need another corporate burger place. The sameness is dreadful. The burgers are average, noise level - average, decor - average, ambiance - nonexistent. Walk across the parking lot to the Greek Patio and get some real food next time you're in north Phoenix."}
{"text":"OMG how can people eat this much cheese? 

I thought I was hardcore. I'm not. 

I got some sort of Colby burger with a side of cheese curds. I wanted as close to the Wisconsin experience as I could get...at least without the alcohol poisoning.

My problem was not how rich this food was, and you'd be silly to come here and not understand what you're getting into. My issue was how *bland* it was. The crunchy bits of onion straws and little dab of what I believe to be steak sauce didn't help. The bun was flavorless and not even toasted. Do you even use salt and pepper on your meat? 

I was more excited about the signature root beer...and the giant TV tuned into the NBA playoffs. Service was surprisingly polite. Like, even better than In n Out.

I'm not saying it's bad, just that I really don't get it. Seems like a great hangover cure, though."}
{"text":"This review covers lunch at one location (Tempe) and dinner at another (Scottsdale). The experiences were similar.  We didn't try the ice cream.

As far as meals are concerned, it is tempting to call Culver's a fast food hamburger joint, similar to McDonald's, Wendy's, etc.  In general, this is a fair comparison because Culver's menu (posted on a screen above the cashiers), burger offerings, non-burger offerings, sides, etc. are very much the same as you would find in any such establishment.

But there are many differences in detail.  At Culver's:
     The seating is better and partly separate from the serving area.
     They bring the food to your table.
     The burgers are bigger, less compacted, and tastier.
     Everything is freshly cooked and hot.
     When they put an extra on a sandwich, like mushrooms or onions, they use a lot of it.
     It is just slightly more expensive (better value).

If you don't really care for hamburger joints, try Culver's.  But be careful not to burn your mouth on the hot food (no kidding)."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends at around 10pm and the cashier greeted us right away. The guy was super helpful and answered our questions. He was very professional!! We got a mini Oreo concrete and strawberry and banana concrete. The Oreo concrete tasted just like a mcflurry from Mcdonalds. So I wasn't too impressed. The strawberry and banana concrete tasted so yummy!! It was blended and tasted very soft kind of like a smoothie? I will be getting that next time. Mmmm"}
{"text":"Most people who know me know that I love food and live to eat! Most people who know me understand that I am slightly eccentric. Most people who know me know that I plan my trips around what and where I am going to eat. So, most people who know me should not be shocked to learn that I drove to Arizona for a hamburger. What Carrie D? You drove to another state just for a hamburger? Are you crazy?

Perhaps I am a bit crazy, but when I read about Culver's I absolutely had to try their burger and custard...so my partner-in-crime (Brian V.) and I booked a hotel, hopped in the Mini, and drove to Arizona. My BFF Forest W. just happens to live in AZ so we picked him up and headed to Culver's.

Once inside I went all \"fan girl\" and honestly I think I freaked out the employees at the counter. They seemed genuinely shocked that I drove from another state just to try their food. After they figured out I wasn't dangerous they described the menu items, took our order, and volunteered to take our picture in front of the menu. They were very cool and alot of fun!

We all had the Three Cheese Triple Butter Burger. Three smash burger patties with American, Swiss, and Cheddar Cheese. It was really good, but did not match the magic of Freddy's Steakburger or Steak & Shake. Definitely a solid 4 star burger though. My two companions shared the fried cheese curds and loved them, in fact Brian V. said he would go back to Culver's just to eat the cheese curds. 

For desert we all had the Flavor of the Day Concrete Mixer which was something involving chocolate custard and snickers...decadent crazy deliciousness! 

Thank you Culver's for not disappointing this slightly crazy burger fan. By the way, it would be awesome if you could open some stores in Southern California!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Culver's! Spent over 40 minutes in drive-thru. 
Then they forgot my ice cream and forgot about me. Got out of my car and manager gave me a free scoopie coin. Seriously. My food is cold and wasted close to an hour waiting for food. 
Don't go to this Culver's. It's the worst!"}
{"text":"Been here many times. Really depends on what time if day for the quality. We love just up the road so we're here often for snacks n such
They offer a great tasting chicken noodle soup and the broccoli cheddar is delish"}
{"text":"This is the only Culver's location I've ever been to where I've been parked and had to wait 25 minutes for a cone. A one-scoop vanilla CONE, that's it. I witnessed orders (mostly single orders of custard) continually being brought out incorrectly. My cone was brought out by someone whose hands it was melting all over. Gross! Why would I want that? I commented on waiting for 25 minutes for a melted cone, and she walked away. I will drive to another location in the future over this one, which is right by my house. It seems like my experience was not unusual, based on the other reviews. Someone needs to train the workers at this location on how to be more efficient, but mostly, just on basic customer service skills."}
{"text":"Typical overpriced fast food - $12.09 for a 2 piece cod, fries and coleslaw - and small drink - dry dinner roll hard butter - makes bread fall apart - not impressed on my first visit!"}
{"text":"Went threw the drive threw! The girls did mess up my order, I did ask before hand if everything was there! They was busy and said yes. So I ran back inside, they were very apologetic and even gave me a free pint of ice cream!!! :) good customer service"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 Stars I would. My husband and I ordered a double cheeseburger basket with fries (for him) and we both got a root beer float on Sunday 11/26/17. Nothing seemed to taste off with his food or our floats. However that night when we got home my husband starting violently throwing up, feeling queasy, and having horrible diarrhea. I instantly knew it was the Culver's since we had some home cooked and well done food for dinner that night. I wasn't too worried since I only had a float. But once midnight or so hit I was shaky and feeling so nauseous. I managed to make it until the morning however started to violently vomit as well. It must have been the floats. I know it is soft serve so maybe the workers do not properly clean the machines. The main problem is that I am 20 weeks pregnant and the amount of times I vomited made me extremely dehydrated and I had to go to triage at the hospital to be put on iv fluids because of that as well as having consistent contractions. In no way am I able to deliver our daughter just yet. Lesson learned: I am never ever eating fast food ever again and I am most certainly not ever coming back to this Culver's!"}
{"text":"Curds....
Butter burgers.....
Milkshakes....

I might be coerced into committing a crime at around 2am if it meant that a bag filled with these beauties was presented to me afterwards...."}
{"text":"The thing that differentiates this place above others is the frozen custard.   Unfortunately, my chocolate mikshake was runny, not thick.  Not sure what happened.  My husband had a vanilla shake and it was fine.

My daughter got a frozen custard in a cup as part of her kids meal and it was fine too. 

The buttered buns on the burger are pretty good, very yummy.  I got the chili and that was good too.

Not sure if the staff was new, but didn't really seem to know what promotions were going on or what the different items were on the menu.  The food was decent.  Probably go again and give them a chance to redeem themselves if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Not sure what others are raving about...this was a greasy flavorless mess.  Drive thru was slow and one you pay you have to drive around to wait 5-10 mins.  Tried tenders..salty and highly breaded.  Fish plate..no flavor and super greasy. Fries were pretty good though.  Stick to Zaxbys across the street."}
{"text":"It's almost dangerous to have Culver's so close to our home.  Any time my wife and I get an ice cream craving, it's a short journey up the road to satiate those dairy desires at the cheapest and best place in our neighborhood.  We've been there many times since it opened and we've always gotten quick service and delicious treats.  I knock a star off for two reasons.  One, the one time we got food other than ice cream it was a bit too greasy, and two our dessert orders have not always been right the first time.  The nice thing about that was getting a free dessert because of a screw-up, but it would have been better if they got it right the first time.  Regardless, with the general quality of the experience being high and the constant promotional flyers they send out being a huge incentive to visit, it's definitely one of our favorite stops."}
{"text":"Wow! I was an out of towner who had tried burgers and just about every local pub in town (over a 3 week period). On a whim, I stopped by here late one night and was just blown away by the food. I could eat these burgers everyday. Amazing!"}
{"text":"My son told me about Culver's a few weeks ago.  Well . . . I tried it and now I love Culver's burgers and fries.  No, it's not In-N-Out, but pretty darn close.  I happen to like burgers that are a bit greasy and crispy.  And best part is they let you add \"what you want\".  Lettuce, tomato, mayo.  Love it!  Fries were hot and crispy.  This place is very clean and that is one of the things that keeps me coming back.  Looking forward to trying their custard (not now . . . I've got a standing appointment with a treadmill this week).

Culver's, I'm glad you're in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes this spot is as good as it gets. The custard is, as to be expected, perfect and my fella adores their malts! A large is under $5 - such a good deal! Seriously, for an enormous ice cream treat such a bargain. I really like their kid's meal deal - don't judge - as it offers a taste of everything (custard, sandwich, fries, & drink). This spot is always fast & friendly. Yeah - the price is higher than most fast food places...yet it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of McDonalds but my boyfriend and I wanted to try something different.  He heard on the radio that this was one of the top 5 fast food places compared to five guys and in and out.  We were starving when we got the food.  We got the burgers, chili fries, and cheese curds. Burgers were average, I think I would still prefer McDonalds over Culver's but it was a new change.  The chili cheese fries were really good I am pretty particular about places when they use nacho cheese, I'm not a fan of the fake cheese.  To my surprise they use real cheddar cheese.  The cheese curds were a no go for us, we didn't like them at all.  I thought the cheese would be melty but it was cold."}

{"text":"The lemon ice is to die for!! I tried the mango,strawberry, lemon ice!!!  Delish! Custard is always good!"}
{"text":"I really like their food,  generally.  And the staff are great.  BUT, their cheesecake oreo mixer wasn't good--I think the cheesecake might have been lemon?  Now I love a good cheesecake, but this did not go together, and threw away 95% of what I ordered.  Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Got to give them four stars, 
Above the crowed, cooked to order food here is simply great.
Yes butter burger is a fun time but the real mean is their entrees 

Fried Chicken and Fried Cod, they keep their fries clean and use a great breading recipe,  try it you'll be back for more.

The beef is ok, sometimes a little salty.  

mixers,
not the biggest fan but they hit the spot when you need to.  be creative and make your own mixer.  

Service,
well its ok, they do bring it to your table and when you do a drive thru don't expect this to be Wendy's, it will take some time depending on what you order.  Your given a number and a nice high school student will bring some food to you.
The service seems to be young here, they just like hiring someone looking for their 1st job or so.  No this does not create the best service but creates, our local future.  giving a younger kid a job is not easy to do and these kids will move onto another job and keep working this is good karma for Culver's Phoenix  and shows an investment in the town.  

I choose to review this location because it has been around.  I used to go out of my way to find a Culver's.  now they are popping up around town.  As a Midwest person this is great to see.  This is mid west food, comforting a little greasy but dedicated to a great meal.

{"text":"How can this not be a National Chain??? Gorgeous, clean place, and the food! It's a far cry from Mickey D's or BK, that's for sure.

If you like battered fish, you have to try the fish sandwich or the fish and chips. I've tried both in the week since I discovered Culver's.

I'm dying to go back and try a strawberry shake and many of the other menu items. Hopefully they will be just as good.

If you are in the area, check it out."}
{"text":"I was at my son's basketball tournament and I have a complaining teenager about being hungry. Found the closest place I could. I've always wanted to try Culver's burgers cause I've heard people talk about it. 

Anyways, order a single butter burger (doesn't sound too healthy) with cheese and fries. My daughter gobbled it up in less than a minute. I though the burger was pretty good. Juicy and fresh. Not bad. The fries were very crispy. Now I have another option when I have a burger craving."}
{"text":"First of all there are too many teenagers working there. They all spend so much time gossiping and not taking care of their customers. It took them 10 minutes to make two sundaes! When I got them they were melted. Our first time there and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"In search of a good hamburger, I recently dined at Culver's (8668 E Shea Boulevard, Scottsdale, AZ 85260). I enjoyed \"The Original\" Butterburger, which consisted of \"fresh, never frozen, Midwest-raised beef\" grilled and served on a lightly buttered and toasted bun. I chose the Wisconsin Cheese Curds, breaded and deep-fried cheddar cheese from the LaGrander Hillside Dairy in Stanley, Wisconsin, as my side dish. For dessert, I had the Lemon Ice, creamy, lemon-flavored ice crystals topped with raspberries. The facilities were clean and very spacious. Parking was readily available."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite place to have hamburgers.  The burgers are smashed thin and cooked so they have a grilled burger lace around the edges.  The crinkle cut French fries are excellent also.  You always have to top off your meal with some custard.  I only wish there was one closer to my house.  Oh, and try the walleye when they have it.  It is fantastic."}
{"text":"Butter Burger and the milkshakes 
Their in house root beer is pretty good too"}
{"text":"I'm from California, and the best way I can describe Culver's is by comparing it to In-N-Out. It's delicious, greasy fast food with a \"cult following\". I recommend the double deluxe burger (2 patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles and mayo) with a side of cheese curds (though the fries are also good) followed by a scoop of the flavor of the day custard. It's very much a Midwestern take on classic burger joint fare.

As other reviewers have mentioned, it might seem expensive next to other fast food joints, but I think it's better food than the usual fast food offerings and our local Culvers usually has very generous coupons (2 for 1 burgers is the best) in local papers and mailers, so two of us usually eat for around 13 bucks. Plus, if you follow the link on your receipt and fill out a survey, you can get a free scoop of custard, at least at this Culvers. They have said they honor expired coupons, which is very nice and goes beyond what's necessary in terms of customer service. The servers and cashiers are always friendly and helpful, and very tolerant of us bringing in coupons every week."}
{"text":"Came in for a couple of sundaes     They were right on top of it,  polite, and quick to get the order completed.  It was nice that a fast food place had plenty of staff on hand to handle the business.   The price for the sundaes were fair.   I am not a big fan of chain places, but it is one of the only places in the southwest valley to get ice cream."}
{"text":"If you think that this food is great, you need to seriously re-evaluate your burger standards. I was dragged here by my grandmother because she loves this place and my mother, brother and I left with nothing but regret. 

The burgers here are awful, my chicken sandwich was nothing special, and the fries are G-ross with a capital G. My mom told my brother and I after the fact that the last time that she visited this place she was running to the toilet immediately afterwards, and my brother had the same results after our dining experience. 

My mom got an earful about not saving us from this place. Seriously, save your money, drive to In-N-Out or something, sure this place has menu variety but that's about the only thing it's got going for it. I feel bad for anyone that is deluded enough to give this place 5 stars because you obviously have no idea what a good burger is."}
{"text":"I know people are crazy for Culver's. It's an ok place for a custard, but I don't get the butter burger thing. Every meal I've eaten there just hasn't set well on my stomach--especially the \"walleye\" sandwich. I even tried a salad in an attempt to find something healthy. The lettuce was wilted and what chicken they had on top was uninspired and as dry as a shoe.   I'll keep trying, though. I haven't had any of their soups, and if these are good I'm willing to rethink this review a bit. 

I will say they are very awesome with kids and generous with the free little dishes of custard for them."}
{"text":"Want ice cream? Yeah, I know it's not really ice cream... But it's good. If you don't mind waiting. I've never gotten good service from here. More times than decent, it was terrible. The food... Nothing special. I haven't gotten a burger that I wanted to go back and get again."}
{"text":"I'm officially in love with Culver's.  Their custard in a concrete mixer tastes like gelato and their butter burgers are comparable to In-In-Out. Way to go DMB! Thanks for bringing this outstanding franchise to Verrado!"}
{"text":"This brand new Culver's is located just north of I-10 on Verrado. It's really an ideal location for travelers and locals. 

I can't eat any of their food--but I'm not judging or penalizing them for that in this review. My husband is pretty darn happy about Culver's. We stopped by yesterday for the first time and used the drive-through. The audio over the speakers was incredibly clear and the woman serving us sounded pleasant and genuinely welcoming. 

My husband ordered a buffalo chicken strip basket with no sauce, fries, and a medium lemonade. After paying, we pulled forward into a reserved spot and waited about five minutes or so. The server came out and profusely apologized for the wait, but there was really nothing to apologize for. I could tell by the bag that the food was hot and fresh. We drove on home, and my husband was very pleased with the quality and tastiness of his food. I have a feeling he'll be a regular there!"}
{"text":"I'm increasingly not a fan of fast food franchise burgers, but Culver's has changed my mind about that. I had the bacon double cheeseburger and was astonished at how fresh the beef tasted! The bun was the perfect texture too, so I can say it was an enjoyable dining experience stuffing this delicious creation down my ravenous gullet. I'm a bit of a condiment whore, so I paid for my slathering ways by getting ketchup and mustard all over my hands and face. By the end of it, I looked like a messy baby... but it was really that good.

And what would a trip to Culver's be without a dessert? Obviously, this is one of the things they are known for judging from the menu and the endless parade of customers who seemed to continuously file in for custard on this hot Phoenix summer day. I had the Bananas Foster sundae over the flavor-of-the-day (Butter Pecan) and it did not suck. My dining companion and I discussed what it was that distinguished Culver's offerings as \"custard\" instead of ice cream. Not knowing the exact difference in preparation, I could only guess it had something to do with the addition of eggs. Accurate or not, the consensus seemed to be that \"it's got puddin' in it!\"

I now know when the mood strikes, I can go to Culver's to get me some righteous puddin'."}
{"text":"Not \"fast food\" 22 minutes in car waiting for food. Like their food but they lack customer service and urgency for getting food out."}
{"text":"Such a perfectly delicious burger. This is steak and shake on steroids. Everything about my experience was awesome from the beginning. I've been eyeing the progress on Culver's since they started construction months ago. I'd never eaten here a day in my life but I had a feeling it was going to be amazing. And it was everything I wanted it to be and more. I came through the drive through and was warmly greeted. Took a minute to peruse the menu and asked for a suggestion before I placed my order. Per the pleasant cashier's suggestion, I opted for a double butter burger with cheese and no onion, fries and a root beer. The wait was short to get to the window and the pleasant demeanor never faded. She asked that I pull around as they prepared the meal to order. After less than 10 minutes my meal was delivered curbside. I almost waited until I arrived to my destination to eat it but for in order to give you my Yelp loves the quality review you deserve, I pulled over in the Culver's parking lot to devour my delicacies...you're welcome. 

The burger was perfectly creamy and juicy piled with fresh toppings. The beef is not your average fast food patty. It is clearly from fresh beef and the perfect inconsistency of shape (and the obviously perfect fat to lean ratio in the meat) gave the edges a divine crispiness that is unparalleled. The fries were absolutely amazing. Perfectly salted, crispy and crunchy outside but hot creamy potato goodness inside. Then I got to wash it all down with a creamy root beer. Best of all this delicious meal set me back less than $8!!! 

This place is quality indeed. This is now my new go to spot for a great burger in general. 

Great job Culver's University team! You've gained a loyal client today."}
{"text":"Going to this location is a hit or miss. The food is always good , the service is hit or mess and 50% of the time they forget items.

I really love the check in offer and that they honor it in the drive thru."}
{"text":"The burgers were amazing.  I had the bacon butter burger.  The portions were large.  The prices were reasonable.  Did I mention that the burgers were amazing?  The staff was friendly, fast and competent.  This, in my opinion, is one of the best burger joints in the east valley."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food and desserts, but tonight the service was great. It was extremely busy but the employees were friendly and quick to help when my little one dropped his entire cheeseburger on the ground. Thanks for the excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Hello friends, 

I ventured to this location the other day to try them out. I ordered the Chicken tenders and their signature \"Butter burger\". Well you have to tell them what you want on your burger. Or, at least I was asked what i wanted on it. That was cool, but i wasn't expecting the need to give them exact detail as the picture seemed like a regular burger with all the regular extras. When I got home much to my surprise I had bread and meat. As in a no frills burger. Yippyyyy I passed many burger joints to come here for a plain burger. - Side Eye-.

The chicken tenders were nothing impressive. Actually the whole ordeal was non eventful and lack luster would be a overstatement. I'll try again another time. I won't give them the 1star based off the one experience. Looking at the pictures fellow Yelpers posted I may go in and show them a picture of what I want next time who knows??

Cheers"}
{"text":"Delicious food and employees who will let you order anything you want any way you want it. Onion rings instead if fries? Yes. Delicious custard instead of soda? Yes. I love this food and this location!"}
{"text":"Staff was extremely friendly, burger was \"ok.\" The buffalo chicken tenders are just spicy breading and were not very good. I waited probably 20 mins to order then another 10 for them to make mediocre food. I'd be willing to try again, maybe when I have a few hours to kill, but try and pick up the pace."}
{"text":"Great fresh burgers, fries, & custard ice cream!!! Reasonably priced for the quality, which is great! I enjoyed the Cheddar bacon double butter burger & fries. Restaurant was clean, staff was helpful & friendly!"}
{"text":"I stopped in during break from classes one day, but never heard of them before.  I grew up on pork tenderloins growing up in the midwest and it's hard to find a good tasting, mouth watering tenderloin sandwich..well Culvers has it..the tenderloin hangs over the bread, it's hot, and it's seasoned perfect..go get one..a must"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Phoenix and then to the East Valley I was looking for new and different places to try.  I had never heard of Culver's.  I looked over their website and on one Saturday afternoon my daughter and I took a ride out this way.  We looked over the menu and I had one of their famous Butter Burgers.....Mushroom and Swiss, and my daughter had a grilled cheese.  The kids meals come with a one scoop sundae too, good deal.  Let me say that Butter Burgers are delicious!  I love them.  Their fries are good too but then I found cheese curds......OMG!  I am from California so I had never had these morsals of goodness before.  A Butter Burger, cheese curds and a root beer and I'm good.  But then the frozen custard.......YUM!!!  And a Concrete Mixer....wow!  And they run a special on pints to take home.  You can get 4 pints of custard for $8 and change!  Good deal!  They have a different flavor everyday.  Recently I had Pumpkin Pecan and it was delicious! The service is always fast and friendly.  I have never experienced anything but a smile here.  This location is about 10 miles from me and not far in the grand scheme of things.  I recently found out that they opened a new location closer to me!!  YAY!!  Forget those other fast food joints.  McDonald's pales in comparison.  Butter Burgers are fresh and soooo good.  And they have a variety of other choices.  They also offer fried chicken, fish and salads.  But note....this is NOT for someone on a diet.  This is where you splurge!  I love Culvers!!  Now if In and Out had frozen custard too I would be torn."}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome! Very nice and friendly staff. It was my first time here. Food is okay, to me it's nothing special just a fast food joint. But I like it just because of the service haha. The blueberry cheesecake custard though OMG"}
{"text":"I use to love going to Culver's on Country Club. My favorite the Cod fish dinner. It use to be absolutely amazing!! I have been getting it for years. I have know idea what happened.. I was at home, my husband was out I asked him to stop by Culver's and pick me up a Cod Dinner, just had a taste for it.. Oh my! what a shock!!, the fish was horrible. There were very little fries and the roll was socked in what ever the fish was fried in.. Like I said I have been going there for a couple of years. Each and every time the fish tasted fresh and light cooked to perfection!!!  What happened?"}
{"text":"So confused on why people think they have good burgers. Even the burger patty looks weird. The buns taste anything like bread and the quality sucks."}
{"text":"I love their butterburgers & custard!  This location has a friendly staff and great customer service.  If you are looking for something new to eat in the area I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Hey buttah buttah!  Hey buttah buttah!

3 & 3/10th stars.

This food reminds me of my childhood.  That's right, I have been eating healthy since a very young age.  Especially things like chili cheese fries.  My daughter pointed out that they know the 3 secrets of French cooking...butter, butter and butter.

The burgers are pretty decent for a fast food burger.  Fries were ok, tasty soft serve but the portion varies wildly based on my two visits.  8 meals for 4 bucks is probably a good idea these days as well."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Had Culver's a long, long time ago when I was growing up in Ohio and visited Wisconsin, then had more of it when I lived in Chicago and went up north again.  Was excited when Culver's finally made it to the Valley.

Comparing Culver's to both fast-casual burger joints AND other frozen custard joints, it holds its 4-star rating.  The custard here is very good.  The concretes here are superior to those at Shake Shack, basically because the custard is superior.  The custard is better than the other chains that have popped up (Rita's, Freddie's), but is not better than some of the independent custard joints I've been to back  in the Midwest.

The burgers and food here are fine too.  I like that they have non-traditional dishes for a burger joint, like fried shrimp (which my wife really likes) and pot roast (which is pretty good for \"fast food\" pot roast.)  Their sides are pretty great - the green beans are never overcooked and the cheese curds are squeaky, just like they should be.  The burgers, being buttered and all, are different from other fast-casual burgers and are a tick above average fast-casual.  

So all in all, 4 stars for Culver's, mostly for their custard."}
{"text":"I liked my burger and my short shake. Didn't like the gnats and flies. There weren't a ton of flies and gnats just enough to annoy while eating."}
{"text":"Culver's always seems to do well. Their steak burgers, unlike Freddy's thin, burnt, tasteless steak burgers, have flavor and perfect texture. Sadly, the staff member taking my order was rushing me and wasn't very respectful. But, there was a very nice staff member that wasn't serving us, but made great, funny conversation and was incredibly sweet. I wish I got his name to say on here, because he made the experience a lot better."}
{"text":"For fast food, Culver's is great. The burgers and frozen custard are on point. The best thing they have though are the Wisconsin cheese curds!"}
{"text":"I like their burgers & cheese curds but I always have to pull forward and wait for my order.  They have also messed up my order the last 2 times I have been there.  We never order their fries but for some reason they want to put fries in my bag instead of curds so I have to park and run back in.  The receipt clearly said curbs, oops. We continue to go there becuase they are the only burger place out on this side of town."}
{"text":"The burgers are tasty, but they're much more expensive than other fast food burger joints. It's definitely worth trying at least once if you're into burgers."}
{"text":"Fairly expensive in comparison to other fast food places, but it definitely tastes different from the other fast food places as well. However, it's still pretty much average. I thought it was odd that it costs more to change your drink to chocolate milk while the chocolate milk can is only 8 ounces (1 cup)."}
{"text":"My grandpa & I had heard great things about this place so we were excited to finally try it out. Pretty good burger and pretty awful service. They messed up his order and then when he asked them to correct it they said they can't because he didn't pay for the toppings he originally asked for they tried charging him extra and only gave like like a limp single piece of mushroom. The staff didn't seem to care at all. When he said never mind they just shrugged and walked away. We won't be coming back. Better burger joints with better burgers out there."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place out and was pleasently surprised. Along with burgers and fries, they have dinner plates. I had fried chicken dinner and was very flavorful. Sides were good too. It was so good I went back and got chrispy chicken sandwich today. Chicken had the right amount of moisture, not dry. 
Can't wait to go back, I like their wide range of sides.  Very different from other fast food places around."}
{"text":"Culver's always brings back fond memories of my living in Rochester, MN. I developed a love for frozen custard and butter burgers.

Each day in Charlotte, I would pass by signs on the highway that said Culver's was close by. I knew that I needed to visit one before going home.

I was delighted to find a Culver's close to where my hotel was. I decided to go through the drive-thru and get some dinner to bring back to the hotel.

The drive-thru is clean and straightforward. I ordered the bacon deluxe butter burger basket with fries and a regular strawberry shake. I then pulled up and paid. I got a number to place on my car's window.

The wait wasn't bad. There was a person ahead of me. Moments later, a person brought my food over. He was friendly and great.

I happily brought my food back to my hotel room after a good shopping day. The bacon deluxe butter burger was perfect. It was juicy and flavourful. It tasted so fresh. I have missed the crinkle-cut fries. They hold the ketchup so perfectly in all the grooves. 

The strawberry custard shake hit the spot. You got real chunks of strawberry. It was so good and creamy.

I am so glad that I got my Culver's fix. Next time I am around, I will give eating at the restaurant a try.

(141)"}
{"text":"Glad to have a taste from the Midwest so close. I grew up with Culver's in IL. I don't understand why they removed fried chicken  family meals from the menu. From the moment we found out they were coming to town we were excited, but it was a let down when we found out they don't have chicken anymore. We used to drive the the Greenfield location to get it."}
{"text":"Good service/friendly staff. I got the cranberry bleu salad and it was good except for the chicken. It wasn't this locations fault but overall Culver's would need to get better chicken for this. It was way too soft and fake tasting so I didn't even eat it. The malt was tasty. It's nice that it wasn't just purely strawberry flavored but instead had real strawberries pieces in it. Good fast lunch/dinner. 3.75."}
{"text":"Omg this place is absolutely amazing friendly fast and CLEAN!!!!! i love how fast and friendly they are for drive thru and Jennifer has the most pleasant and professional voice ever and super sweet young lady my dining experience here is amazing as well they have someone to make sure you have everything you need and as a courtesy to you they throw your trash away they are super clean!!!!!!!!!!!! Too clean!!!!"}
{"text":"A second try and my last.  The pub burger was a double patty with onion strings on an onion roll.  Burnt edges of the burger just bland taste beside the onion overkill.  It's too bad, it's close just not for me."}
{"text":"We love Culvers. Maybe too much!! LOL  We go probably 1 time a week. We try and watch our diet, so Culver's may be a bit dangerous for us. We order a kids meal cheesburger with a side salad and iced tea the the free little custard. With a Sr discount it's only $12. Awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"First time I've had Culver's anywhere and I loved it. I got a bacon deluxe burger without onions and a root beer float. The patty wasn't super thick, so I didn't feel like a cow for devouring the burger. The patty and the bacon appeared to be fresh off the grill. The lettuce and tomatoes were crisp and freshly cut, respectively. It was just the right size for $2.99! The root beer float was great; the custard was super thick and didn't melt immediately to make root beer soup. The cheese curds were like mozz sticks in ball form. Little cheese bombs. 
Best part was that I ate there, and the servers bring you the food when it's ready. I got to sit outside and bask in the sun and chat on the phone without waiting inside as they cooked my food."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Culver's and was not impressed.  I paid $7 for a combo meal and the burger was small (it was supposed to be their larger burger) and the fries looked like they came from a frozen package from the grocery store.  The place was clean and the staff was friendly...but I don't think this place will be around in AZ very long."}
{"text":"Food's good except for that annoying thing that places do with up charge for gluten-free. I mean,  until you offered the gf bun, I was not a customer.  Now that I come in, you punish me for having an ailment?  Side salad is good if you like iceberg lettuce but better option than fries.  HORRID  music and the speakers not working make it worse. Friendly staff,  good service."}
{"text":"very friendly staff that gets the five stars for sure  burger was not cooked very well supposed to be coturized on one side not burnt till the burger is dry the rest was fantastic bun was warm and toasty fries where on point much much better than than lobby's or burger rush for the money staff really seems to care always asking to refill your drink or take your trash  only thing i didnt get was why a manager is checking the mailbox outside when its busy inside and it's a SUNDAY?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom.  Cheese curds!

Used to have Culvers butter burgers and cheese curds when I was in college, in Wisconsin.  Yay to the fates for bringing them to Avondale!

Met the family that owns the place and they are super nice.  Food is higher quality and costs a little more.  It's worth it.  Burgers are super yum, desserts are a big hit with my wife and daughter, and I eat cheese curds until my lactose intolerance warns me otherwise.  

Non-burger options are also good-- French Dip, chicken, and soup.  Ice cream is actually custard, so it's thicker.  May be an extra good thing to stand up to the AZ hell-summer.  My work team loves it when we bring in Concrete Mixers for them for special occasions."}
{"text":"This is a well-run, but very busy restaurant. I go here periodically to either and get lunch with my family or more often for ice cream runs in the evening. If you go through the drive-thru you generally have to wait for them to bring your food out to you comma but the food is always tasty."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Came in tonight and the cashier made me feel dumb for asking for a topping in the free scoop of ice cream. Which is whatever. Not too worried about that. But I paid extra for onion rings in the meal and got home and of course they were fries not onion rings. Won't be coming back.

This is something you'd expect from McDonald's or Wendy's. But I thought Culver's was better than that..."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero star I would!!! I have come here 3 times and each time they mess my order up and I have to drive bak each time. First time they messed it up they sent me a free ice cream on a $50 order. Like wow you must really want my business. Not!! Now tonight again  I thought ok I'll try it again since my kids like the chicken well... I drove home they missed half my order again.  I work in the food industry and not only is customer service big but getting the orders right and to the right customer!!! I will never eat here again. Also offering a free ice cream isn't really a Im sorry gesture."}
{"text":"First time at this place and my goodness their concrete mixers are so freaking good mix just righ. The food I ordered was great. Everything was great the service the people that I had to come back a second time in one day!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all this food is overpriced and it's not very good.  I won't be going back it was a huge letdown for me."}
{"text":"It is fast food. Not like Mcdonalds or Wendy's but still at the end of the day it's fast food.

Pros:
- Good butter burger and custard.
- Fast service.

Cons:
- On two occasions they forgot a bun on my burger! How? I was already home and they asked if I wanted to drive back for a bun?...... I laughed and said no. I ate my burger bunless so they probably got the last laugh.
- One time I also ordered a burger and got home to open up a fish meal? I wasn't upset because I like fish but I had beef on my mind. I still ate the fish...
- I know the workers here are kids but they never seem to remember the flavor of the day after just saying it to three customers in front of me."}
{"text":"Been to this location many times before, never had any reason to complain. Today, my family and I came here for a nice lunch.  They are a bit pricey for us, but we've always enjoyed the quality and flavor of food.  I ordered a Mushroom Swiss burger with a side of cheese curds.  I lifted the lid off my burger.  Looked a bit burnt, and there were hardly any mushrooms and they were all bunched to one side of the bun, I wished I would've taken a picture.  I was too tired and hungry to make an issue of it.  The cheese curds were  awesome as usual.  My wife tried their crispy chicken sandwich.  She felt it was on the bland side.  I took a taste and I agree.  My kids had corn dogs and were pretty happy with their meals.  First time we've come here and felt disappointed with our food."}
{"text":"As a Wisconsin native, I am partial to Culvers....but unfortunately echo the reviews regarding the drive thru. Don't bother. I don't complain about the wait for made to order fast food but when you don't have customers pull through for their order & make others wait for their order with melting ice cream.... need I say more? Well if you choose to call & provide feedback on your less than happy service, the manager will likely \"add your name to the book\".....but when you return for 2nd chance order & it's not correct.... I won't be back. The Deer Valley location has a lot to teach this location. While I called tonight & spoke with the manager, Arron, I shared all of my thoughts above & said thanks but no thanks. Again, huge disappointment for the service in drive thru.  Maybe if your order inside it's different but for someone who doesn't eat fast food  on a regular basis but supports Culvers due to their business model, drive thru is kind of the reason to go.  Keep driving & head to another location."}
{"text":"Well we had 1 billion coupons for culvers, so we gave it a try. I had a cashew chicken salad.. And it was actually not too bad. There was a good amount of chicken. It wasn't gourmet by any means, but hey for 7 bucks it wasn't too bad. 

But let's be honest the CUSTARD Is where it's at. Plus you can get a free cone if you do the survey on your receipt. 

If I lived close to a culvers.. I would be overweight from the custard. It's heaven people"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The establishment is also clean and well kept by staff and management."}
{"text":"Nice clean place.  Sometimes it takes a while but at least you can take a number and sit and wait.  Good hamburgers, fries and the cod is great. Don't care for the custard, but that's just me."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. The staff had no clue what they were doing. Asked for cheese curds as a side and they said its $1 extra... That's fine. Then they bring me my food and they gave me a fry. I told her it was wrong and she had the nerve to take my card to charge the extra $1 for my cheese curds. After me waiting for 15 minutes you can't even just give them to me, you have to charge?!?"}
{"text":"good food and clean surroundings made to order is the best to eat it fresh and hot and they deliver to your table."}
{"text":"Would have given more stars if it literally wasn't for the chick working the drive through. Honestly she should not be in customer service with her attitude. If the management reads this throw her on grill or something because that was just sad."}
{"text":"This is a bigger Culver's - and it needs to be.  This location can get pretty busy.  The woman taking our order was super fast and efficient.  We ordered and paid in what felt like seconds.  We took our number, grabbed some drinks and sat down.  Before we could get through the flip-card display on the table, our food had arrived.

I don't know what their deal is, but they had $1 waffle cones (every day?  Just Thursday?  I don't know, but it was great!).

Standard Culver's food - good and consistent."}
{"text":"This Culver's is a frequent family visit being close to our home.  Cross Plains doesn't have too much to offer, but having a Culver's is a nice, reliable option when you don't feel like putting effort into dinner for the family.

I usually complain that burgers are inconsistent at Culver's.  One time they'll be juicy and tasty, other times they'll be dry and overcooked.  But this location does a good job and putting out consistent product.  

Our orders are always complex.  Substitute this for that, hold this, add a coupon and a loyalty card...  I *always* go in to order just so it's easier to sort my stuff out (plus I can sip on my soda while I wait).  With our complex orders, there is ample opportunity to gaffe something, but as of late, they've been doing a great job of nailing the order.  I commend them for that!

I appreciate Culver's hiring high school students.  They have a good mix of \"kids\" and adults on staff.  I get good customer service no matter who is helping me, so they are training staff well there.

Tasty.  Reliable.  Friendly.  I'm happy to have a Culver's in town to serve our needs."}
{"text":"I would give 4 stars for the food and 2 for the service. That should balance out to a 3, but I am disappointed enough right now to not feel generous at the moment.

Everything I've eaten here on multiple visits has been delicious: Rich, real flavors. None of the acidic aftertaste of McDonald's/Burger King/Wendy's. The ice cream is reason enough to go in and of itself. Everything on the menu works as comfort food.

And I've enjoyed it all, once I have gone through the labors of Hercules to finally get what I ordered.

Today in the drive-thru they managed to ask my drink order on 5 different occasions, and still got it wrong. Medium Diet Pepsi and a small Sierra Mist. It's almost a mantra for me now. I was given fries after twice specifying onion rings. My kid wanted ketchup for his chicken tenders and got nothing instead. And there were no napkins in the bags. 

At other times they have omitted parts of orders placed inside, or sent me something that had nothing to do with what I had ordered. The help has noted the mistakes by nodding in some sort of brain-dead daze and wandering off in the distance.

I guess it must be rocket science. 

So if you have time and stress to burn, go to Culvers and be rewarded with some really good flavors."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a fast food person, but I keep hearing good things about this place, so I decided today to give it a try. I ordered the butter burger, and some cheese curd things.. I'm not sure of the name because i ordered to go in a hurry. The burger was pretty good, the beef actually taste a little like beef, I was shocked.. It was actually pretty good. I'll probably come here again when I crave for another burger."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and the burgers are pretty good - we usually get the double deluxe (to share) but my favorite is the pattie melt.  We go here mainly for the french fries (crispy crinkle cut) and I really like their chocolate malts."}
{"text":"Fantastic service!!!! Cherie was the drive through employee and she had  impeccable manners!"}
{"text":"After 2 ice cream treats for the kids and 1 meal I was out $16 large ones.  Glad we decided just to get desert here.  I can say yes the desert is good, but $16 good, I am still in denial on what I spent on desert.  The burgers are good, yet the larger size fries are not for the win.  
I totally agree with Zach L.  Desert here 4-5 stars for a fast food place.  Food is 1-2 stars overall.  
Plan to have desert here, what is also great about this location is that I can wash my car for $3 next door. :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING! everything you can ask for from a fast food restaurant! great food, customer service, atmosphere, and custard. Hands down our favorite fast food joint."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of their food, but I sure do love their custard ice cream!"}
{"text":"Just like in the Midwest. Great food and service. They even offer dog biscuits at the drive through window if you have your dogs in the car. Everyone is super friendly!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Culver's and it came highly recommended. At my friends suggestion, I tried the butter burger deluxe, fried cheese curd and the.....I forgot what it was called, but the frozen custard - basically the equivalent of a DQ Blizzard.
The burger patties were paper thin (thus the reason I ordered the double), the lettuce was crisp, tomatoes fresh, bun soft and buttery. I thoroughly enjoyed my burger. Very flavorful!
I had never had fried cheese curd and had no idea what to expect. The closest thing I can think to compare these to would be mozzarella sticks. They are about the size of a grape, and full of salty cheesy goodness.
The custard was delicious! I had the vanilla with butterscotch and oreos (I ordered butterscotch and brownie pieces, but there was a mixup, but I had no complaints).
I really loved everything I had. The menu is big and I can't wait to go next time so I can try something new. 
The thing I didn't like was the bible verses all over the walls.
Seriously?? It's not that I am anti-religion or anything. I am Catholic, went to Brophy and go to church twice a year. I don't need it thrown in my face while trying to eat with my friends. take a tip from In and Out. Put them on the under side of your cups. Work on your subtlety Culver's."}
{"text":"My original review still sticks. 

We went inside this time. Burgers still good, juicy and delish. Got mine topped with mushrooms and swiss. Added some cheese curds to the side - which may have been a mistake. Not that they were bad - but 2 patties w/cheese, curds and a malted are plenty o' calories and fat for me in one sitting. 

If yer lookin for a juicy burger and a malt - check it out."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've been to Culver's. I tried the Wisconsin swiss melt, onion rings, and an order of cheese curds. Everything was delicious! The Swiss melt was soooo cheesy and awesomely greasy lol. The onion rings were flavorful and crisp. I must admit though, i wanted to try the cheese curds the most. I heard very good things about them and they lived up to their hype. I was even impressed with the nice woman who worked the drive-thru. It was refreshing to deal with someone who didn't seem like they were upset with the world. Culver's has made a new fan today."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The people are friendly and always smiling. I also haven't had a single problem with them for as many times as I go :D The food is delicious and worth the price you pay. If you'd love to try a delicious, greasy, fresh veggies, yummy, and fantastic burger, DEFINITELY go here! :) oh, and did I say delicious!? Well, D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S!"}
{"text":"Great prices and great food for a fast food joint. The beef and bread are great and are different than the typical fast food restaurant. Diverse dessert menu and great service."}
{"text":"CUSTARD ONLY ! ! !

On my way home from work, I decided that I needed something cold and sweet . . . and so I decided to stop by Culvers for a custard.  Ordered the daily special . . . today's was Turtle Cheesecake (two scoops on a waffle cone) . . . OMG . . . it was out of this world.

Here was my dilema . . . I'm now finished . . . I'm still not quite half way home . . . do I go back for another . . . Home won . . . but I will be back.

There is only one problem with the Daily special custards . . . if they have a mix in them, like pieces of cheese cake, nuts, or fresh fruit . . . they are mosly on the top of the custard and not throughout . . . so when you get to the bottom of the cone, you ussually only have the base custard . . . still great . . . but sometimes you still want the extras."}
{"text":"There are no Culver's in Vegas, I really wished it was, but since it's not, I'm willing to travel to the next closest state (Arizona) to get my burger and cheese curds fix.  Being from the Midwest they have Culver's and hometown places EVERYWHERE!! And Vegas doesn't really have anything like what I've been craving.  So, I go!  Always great service, I spent like $30.00 for burgers curds and concrete mixers... DONE!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Culver's, the food, the  service and the food LOL! Make sure that you have coupons and use them.  I always have a coupon for a scoop of ice cream for FREE. Take advantage of that."}
{"text":"I usually give Culver's a '5 star' rating regardless of service.  But, I didn't like the fact that when my team were dining in, and our food was being delivered, the server just dropped our food on the table and ran off without asking us if we needed anything else.  So, of course, I had to excuse myself and go to the counter to ask for extra sauces and what not...BOO!"}
{"text":"The location on Avondale is my regular Culver's, but I was in the area and came in for dinner. I got my usual Cheddar Butterburger single basket (ketchup, mustard, pickles) w/ cheese curds. I like to trade half my cheese curds for half my b/f's fries. :) The dining room was busy and it took awhile to get our food. When I got my burger, it had bacon and no pickles. Not what I asked for! But not catastrophic. The Avondale location is better."}
{"text":"Oh Culver's... how I love thee. The drive thru was long so I opted to go inside where there wasn't a line. I got a Cheddar Butterburger single basket (ketchup, mustard, pickles) with cheese curds. Super tasty. My mix of fruit punch and iced tea was not so good, but that's on me."}
{"text":"This place is special. It has it all. Great service. Excellent burgers and frozen custard. The staff were very friendly. They bring your order to your table. 
The burgers , chicken sandwich, fries and custard  were excellent ...  Culver's Chandler is special."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great tasting burger, then this is the place to stop into!  
Conveniently located in Surprise with lots of parking.  Restaurant was clean except for some tabletops and small in my opinion (-1).  Staff are welcoming and friendly.  Service is fast.
Menu is extensive so take a while to decide what you want!
Their burgers are great - tasty, filling, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  They even butter the outside of the bread which makes it even more tastier.  Fries are good - fresh and hot.
Their concrete mixers it would seem is their specialty with about 19 flavors from what I counted.  I wouldn't compare it to DQ's Blizzard but it's right up there and it's really tasty.
Definitely will be coming back here to try some of the other varieties on the menu including other concrete mixer drinks....so addicting!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the pub burgers, though I think they are trying to kill me.  Perhaps that is a fair trade?  I AM eating them, after all.  They make a pretty burger, hot and made to order, but it always seems greasy.  The cheese curds are good, but not quite like authentic Wisconsin cheese curds. I hate that little blue number they give you to  stick on your window when you \"pull forward\" in the drive through...even if there is no one behind you.  What's the deal with that anyway?"}
{"text":"A quick pre-show meal with a buddy while in town to a place we always enjoy.

Today was the Triple Deluxe Butter Burger basket. These burgers are so flavorful and fresh.  For a triple, it's not huge, but is so tasty.  The fries are the large crinkle cut type.

The service here was as expected, friendly and perfect.  You can tell that Culvers only hires the right people."}
{"text":"This place has the best Burgers and Chicken Sandwichs in South Carolina."}
{"text":"Poor response to a service error.  We ordered drive-up service, and received the incorrect order.  I was willing to accept an honest mistake, but I had to drive around, come inside the restaurant, and wait for over 40 minutes while they corrected their mistake.  While the manager got involved, he didn't assist in any meaningful way.  Once I got home, I found a burger that was short a patty (had ordered a \"standard\" double) and another that was rare.  We reported the poor experience to management AND through the corporate website and apparently nobody in Culver world cares about service, because to date we haven't  received any response.  Be cautious, while we have had Culver's many times, they do not care about backing up their commitment to service or quality. Check your order before leaving the premises, or face a major disappointment once you get home."}
{"text":"My whole family puked them selves to death after eating what tasted like  even though I love culvers"}
{"text":"$2:47 for a tiny ice cream cone with two miniature scoops of ice cream in it you can get this same ice cream cone from McDonald's or Burger King for $0.69 with Twice the Ice Cream don't come here with the children for ice cream cones that's for sure. The ice cream is good yes but not worth $2.50 on top of that the cone was stale"}
{"text":"I would give 2 stars because to me, this food is at absolute best 2 star food.  But I think other people would like it more than me.  They absolutely kill their burgers with cheese.  Huge amounts of very strong flavored cheese.  Cheddar, I believe.  Most people like cheese more than me, so they might like it slightly more.  I do really love many cheeses, but when they are the only thing I can taste on my burger, calm it down!  I couldn't taste anything but cheese.  If you removed the burger, it'd taste the same.

Also the cheese is cold and the bread is awful.  This place recreates those overcooked preformed dense picnic party burgers you had growing up.  Except with tons of bright yellow cheese.  Tons of it.

If they have a grilled cheese sandwich, just order that.  Or ask for no cheese on your burger."}
{"text":"Haha asked 2 different employees how the pork tender loin sandwich was one said never had could not tell me the next employee says don't recommend it's a old codger sandwich tasted like he was at Dennys got the Wisconsin swiss burger and cheese curds food was good wife got the butter burger with cheese very tasty"}
{"text":"Every time I am at this Culver's, the service is exceptional, drive thru or dining room. Always greeted by team members with fantastic attitudes, and speedy service. Food is always fresh, hot, and as ordered. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and so I figured it was finally time for a review.

My conclusions are as follows:

Only come here if you want cheese curds, or some variety of ice cream. 

The burgers and sandwiches are all overly greasy and over priced. The flavor isn't quite right either.

If you decide on curds, don't waste your time with the family size. It's always the same size as a large for me and costs a ton more. They're delicious but not worth the premium for the family size. 

The management is cheap too. Want a dipping sauce for your curds? Guess what - you have to ask for it and you get charged a premium for ranch.

The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because of those curds."}
{"text":"For fast food - at least fairly fast - this is excellent.  Salads very good - although I wish they would bring back the cobb.  Burgers good, fries good and custard good.

As pointed out by another reviewer, this is not the best frozen custard I've had (try Sheridans in Watauga Texas), but it is very good.

Service always exceptional and cleanliness outstanding.  I enjoy the sports on TV when lunching alone as well.

Give it a shot.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So after a almost 10 year break, we decided to retry Culvers with a delivery of coupons in the mail. 
Waited and had food delivered, and the woman asked \"did I get the fries\"?
So more wait time and a hot bag is delivered.
Small of hot food was pleasing, tried a onion ring and got an old one.
I have to say for the prices You Should Be Expecting much better quality and and much fresher. It's still sad that after all these years we still don't have a good reason to Visit other than the Mountain Dew Concrete Mixer that is priced higher than a Starbucks Carmel Macciatto...
Small chat after we clean up... I ask my wife...\"What is for diner\"..lol
SHE asked me what I got her to drink. I say Pepsi..she hands it to me..FLAT 
HER upside was her cod was ok
This time
We all ate and did not have food poisoning. 
Update may occur."}
{"text":"I try to avoid doing big chains, but occasionally I make exceptions. 

I've been to this location a few times and it's always been good. The burgers are a bit greasy but honestly, it's not like a bad greasy if that makes sense. The pot roast sandwich, burgers and custard are all really good. They're also fast and fresh, even when you're close to their closing time. It's a great spot for me to hit up late at night in a pinch."}
{"text":"My taste buds were out of service when I came here. I had minimal taste but I could tell that what I was eating was delicious. The patty on the burger looked good. The fries not so much but the cheese curds were good. I wanted to taste it so bad I went back two days later and I wasn't disappointed. Everything was good. Their ice creams were good too. I wish we had Culver's in California."}
{"text":"Stopped here for desert last night 10/20 at 9:00pm the drive through girl was such a bitch I will never come back. We ordered 3 Waffle cones, 2 with the flavor of the day and one chocolate. I watched as another team member made the cones, she \"threw\" them on a bare counter without anything under the them, so the ice cream was touching a dirty surface, where food, money, dirty hands and who knows what else touched the surface. Additionally, when I said I would not take the one with the ice cream touching the dirty surface she became the worst person you ever met. I thought Culver's hired nice people who had positive attitudes all the time? I had to ask 3 times for napkins and spoons. She held up one spoon and asked me if this would be enough, come on 3 people and one spoon? Her co-worker showed up with 2 additional spoons and I had to ask again for napkins. Buckeye is SO MUCH better than Surprise. This is it for me, I will not come back to any of the locations this owner has, what a waste of a good Friday night."}
{"text":"Love the food here along with the exceptional customer service. I normally get a triple burger with cheese which is to die for. I don't care much about custard, but it tastes great and my wife and kids love it!"}
{"text":"Now I am not one to dismiss a good burger joint, one of my favorite foods. This place is cool looking with lots of ice cream options, however I found the burgers to be quite greasy. 

I'll pass from eating here again!"}
{"text":"The management of this restaurant treats it's employees like crap. The food is mediocre at best. The yogurt (or whatever it is) is no where near as good as Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"This place is crazy busy everytime ive gone! (not in a bad way either, ordering process is fast) i didnt have their butter burger but my boyfriend went back for three days in a row..haha. (he jokes that he thinks they added something addicting to their food lol) i had the Caesar chx salad, and the chx tasted so fresh. yum! The brownie batter mixer is pretty good too, although it could have used more chunks of brownie :P when we shared it, there was only one good piece. hope this review helps. ENJOY."}
{"text":"Great service, the food comes out fast and is delicious! They have authentic WI cheese curds and the daily ice cream specials are amazing."}
{"text":"Culver's is okay, burgers have  good flavor. The price and service are really the downfall of the place. For 9 dollars I'd rather go elsewhere the burgers are kinda small for the price. The service seems to be lacking the last couple of times I've come  they messed up something on my order. The cheese curds are the best part. This place serves as a good alternative every now and then when I don't want to deal with the INO. Crowd."}
{"text":"Was so excited to have a culvers nearby but I was so disappointed had the beef pot roast sandwhich is cold paying 10 bucks for a meal and having it come out cold was a disappointment"}
{"text":"I used to love Culver's, but they discontinued the fried chicken!! So...yesterday I ordered two chicken strip \"value meals\" but I saw absolutely no value in paying $9.00 for four tasteless chicken strips, fries and a drink ($20.00 for two meals)!! 

My kid had fries and I had onion rings. So...my kid got four large chicken strips with his fries. Two of my four chicken strips were LITTLE and two were medium sized, not large like my kid's strips. So employees...PAY ATTENTION and distribute the chicken strips according to size!! I'm glad I didn't order these two \"value meals\" for two kids or there would have been an issue because both kids would have wanted the larger chicken strips, not settle for less than the sibling.

I just decided it was diet night for me since mine were small and watched my kid eat his large chicken strips. To be honest, I didn't mind much because the chicken strips don't have much flavor (and they don't offer buffalo sauce, just basic stuff like ranch or BBQ) and I really don't care for the lack of texture. I will never order chicken strips at Culver's again!! I really miss the fried chicken!!!"}
{"text":"We heard so much about how great Culver's burgers were that we decided to go ahead and give it a try.  I really enjoyed the fries as they were fresh and hot but the burger was was room temperature and lacked toppings so I wasn't impressed.  The flavor of the burger was good but it wasn't hot and fresh and it was a super thin patty.  I was OK with the fact that the patty was thin but my hubby wanted some meat on his burger!  I asked for lettuce and mayo on my burger and got just a couple of shreds of lettuce ( that I could hardly even see) in the middle of the burger and the mayo was just a small amount in the middle of the burger. They didn't even place the cheese in the center so that was also irritating.  My husband asked for pickle on his burger and they gave him ONE slice of pickle.  We had to laugh at that one! He must have said he wanted a pickle on his burger not pickles?  I don't know? I have a pet peeve about not spreading the toppings on the full bun so you don't just get a plain burger until you get to the middle. I mean really?  How hard is it to make a sandwich??  The root beer is amazing here!!  And the custard was fantastic!  The best place to get custard used to be Nielson's however, the original owner sold the business and the custard is not the same, so it was great to find Culver's that is pretty close to how Nielson's custard used to be.  The service was also awesome.  All the employees were very helpful and friendly here."}
{"text":"HELLO MANAGER!!!!! I can give you FIVE stars UNLESS I arrive when the sun is BLARING into the majority of the entire restaurant during sunset!!! We planned on going for dinner tonight, but remembered leaving several times with migraines!! Get some damn blinds and we'll be there for dinner!! Until then, we will go elsewhere during evening hours!!!! 

Why don't you sit your ass down on one of those tables when the hot Arizona sun is setting right in your EYES while you try to enjoy a meal!! Maybe then you will FINALLY (I have complained numerous times!!!) fix the problem!!!! I'm sure you are losing a LOT more money in profits than you are saving by being an idiot by not fixing the problem!!! It is a REAL PROBLEM that customers are noticing and, therefore, avoiding your restaurant in the sunset hours!!!!

Yes.....for some reason you have blinds on the north and south windows. Trying to figure out why the hell you haven't put blinds where the NEED TO BE!!!! 

Contact me when you put up some blinds and I'll remove this review. Check my previous review and see that I would like to be a regular customer, but I guess it will be only for lunch until you easily FIX this obvious and outrageous problem!!!"}
{"text":"Try the Fish Fry

I'm from Milwaukee, WI.  Land of the Friday Night Fish Fry.  My idea of the perfect fish fry is beer battered, potato pancakes w/applesauce, cole slaw and a salted caraway snack rye bread or roll.  

Last Lenten season we tried a new place every Friday looking for anything that came close to what I love in Milwaukee.  No dice.  Chompie's for example had a good potato pancake, but the fish batter wasn't very good, cole slaw was blah and the bread was wrong (and it was like $12/$13, pricey for fish fry).

Last Friday I tried the Fish Fry at Culver's and it was good.  Ok, it didn't have the potato pancakes and the bread was wrong, but the fish and cole slaw was really tasty.  I liked the french frys and would deal with the dinner roll vs. rye bread.

Great value and quality fish fry.  I'm saving my 5 stars for the ultimate, throw down, it's just like home fish fry.

My only complaint about Culver's (besides Pepsi products, yuck) is that they have built this location close enough to my home that my girlish figure will surely suffer.   Haven't  started checking flavor of the day forecasts yet but summer will be here soon enough."}
{"text":"Delicious grilled burgers freshly made which is why there is often a backup. Best when there are coupons. Buy one basket & burger separately & share the fries. Otherwise a bit $ for drive thru"}
{"text":"Clean - Professional staff- good food!! Love there kids grilled cheese sandwich yummy-yummy-yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this location 2 different reviews.

5 stars for the customer service as I went through the drive-thru and then had a very sweet lady named Theresa who while being mature in her years, RAN THE FOOD OUT TO ME. She did not have to and to be honest they should probably have one of the younger employees doing it but her attitude, hustle and smile almost made up for the horrible food.

I had the Cod basket with a sweet tea and onion rings. Rings were cold and too greasy, sweet tea was way too warm and diluted to be consider much more then luke warm water, finally the cod sandwich. The cod was MUCH smaller then pictured on their menu and tasteless plus cold and the cheese was not melted. tatar sauce was bland as well.

The big ripoff was on the onion rings. I understand charging more for onion rings then just getting French fries BUT...the difference between an order of French fries and onion rings is $0.80 on the menu yet they charge you $1.00 to upgrade ? Bad math and bad policy on that to say the least plus since they were cold and greasy it makes it worse.

Again great staff for customer service but Horrible cold food and warm water they pass for sweet tea.

The cooks need to be talked to about this lack of care and the manager should address the issue about over charging for onion rings.

Almost $11.00 for horrible food is wrong..."}
{"text":"I can understand Culver's gets busy, especially during lunch time, but the parking lot is horrible, you can barely move around in the parking lot. This place could be a little cleaner too. The staff if very friendly but sometimes rushes you through your order!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic location and the customer service is fantastic.  Why?  The person that took us under his wing was Bob, the 2nd Assistant Manager and he went far beyond the norm.  We have daughter that is allergic to soy, gluten and dairy and both black beans and pinto beans so you can imagine the difficulty with getting her the proper nutrition and the right amount of protein.  When we told Bob our needs he said that he could take the fish, and cook it adding only lemon juice and a little olive oil.  That was great but he even went further, he cleaned the part of the grill that he used to remove any gluten or soy residue and had the person that makes salads use new gloves (no residue from gluten or soy).  So the meal was great and the service even better.  Thank you Bob.  
As others with allergies know it is difficult to find locations to go to and get good food. So I recommend this Culver's  at Shea and the 101."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through and didn't have to wait! Good! They forgot my cherry on the mixer but gladly put one on when I reminded them"}
{"text":"Once again, I can't reiterate how much I'm in love with Culver's. The burgers just taste so awesome! The patties are big and the buns are moist and fresh. Great job guys! I'm also in love with the crinkle cut fries with a side of cheese dipping sauce. I sometimes just go to get it for a snack when I'm at work! The Frozen Custard is also amazingly fresh and I just can't get enough of it. Very friendly service at all locations in definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I would give it six stars if I could! This was a very pleasing first-time experience for me at Culver's. Friends from Wisconsin had been recommending to me for years that I try it one of the days when I get out there. But alas I also find many in the Phoenix area! So I decided to try one on a lunch break from a work training. The gentleman at the counter was very helpful. I told him it was my first time and he explained everything to me. I got the double mushroom butter burger, cheese curds, and a cashew caramel custard. A bit heavy but I could have a small dinner later. Wow! I was not disappointed. The burger was just very delicious. The meat was cooked just right, the patties were a good size, the cheese and mushrooms mixed well, and the bun was very buttery. The cheese curds were also an added bonus as I haven't had them since I was at the Minnesota State Fair in 1998. The custard also is very good and smooth and overall I was just very pleased with the experience. The whole restaurant was clean and I was very happy. A bit pricey but I definitely got my money's worth."}
{"text":"I love going to Culver's! BUT tonight I was disappointed my burger was not  even warm, location was not as clean as usual and the carpet really needs to be replaced. NO WIFI! Really it is time for a remodel."}
{"text":"I LOVE Culvers! Their butter burgers and cheese curds are mouth-watering and I always order their creamy home-brewed root beer. And their custard is always wonderful. I am utterly addicted to this place."}
{"text":"This location is the newest in Madison.  So the inside and outside are very well taken care of.  It is easy to get in and out of on one side of Mineral Point Road.  To cross, you either have to find a U-Turn spot, turn into the Mall area, or back track past an office building to the intersection with the light.

Culver's is a solid brand of fast food.  Fresh ingredients.  I tend to just get food here, as I am never in the mood for custard or other treats after grocery shopping or before seeing a movie.  I like this option versus McDonalds or the two chicken chains nearby.  I'm glad I have this choice on the Westside."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this chain restaurant.  This Middleton location is probably the easiest for me to get too.  I like the chicken strip value meal.  Upgrade fries to Onion Rings.  I can usually find a dollar off coupon somewhere (back of my women's basketball ticket or newspaper).  It's just a nice filling dinner.

Usually the staff is super friendly and professional.  This night was a bit off but I will chalk it up to kids coming back to work after a holiday and they were happy to see each other."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and crispy crinkle fries! Custard is very creamy. Good food but don't do the drive thru!! 10 minutes for each car to order! Be sure to try the cheese curds and custard."}
{"text":"Excellent shakes and the cod sandwich is great.  We will back and try some other entrees.  Watch what you order or you may want to go for a really long walk afterwards:-)"}
{"text":"We try a Culvers every now and then trying to like it and can't figure out what everyone likes about this place, especially the \"mixers\".  Also the prices seem to be higher than I expect.     I guess I fit the definition of 'crazy' as I continue to go there and expect a different outcome.....certifiable!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for burgers, ice cream, and those cheese curds. Friendly employees and clean store. I would recommend to others especially if they haven't been to culvers before"}
{"text":"Great burgers here for the price but go to Michael's down the road for better custard.  

Culver's chain restaurants are very consistent and make good burgers but I'm not a fan of their frozen custard.  I'd rather have Micheal's or good ice cream any day."}
{"text":"Custard is awesome and wayyyyyyy better than Dairy Queen. Burgers aren't bad for lunch, and the cheese curds can be delicious if they are fresh. Service is spotty here though. I either get super friendly, or someone who clearly hates their life. Occasionally takes longer than it should, but overall a fan of the custard so I keep coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. Employees were friendly and helpful and were making sure everything was taken care of. Burger and fries were really tasty, nice seasoning on the meat."}
{"text":"I hate to put in bad reviews but I just went through the drive through and ordered a grilled chicken sandwich.  The service was fine and the lady was very nice but it was hands down the worst sandwich of my life.  The chicken was like piece of rubber that snapped between my teethe when biting into it and literally made me gag. I took the chicken off the bun and ate the bread with the pickles and lettuce because I was starving.  The fries were fine.  I will never go here again and if I could give them a negative 5 stars I would.  Sooo disgusting. Sorry, I hate doing this to anyone's business.  :-("}
{"text":"First time here and love their food. Was greeted with a hello and a smile and had very fast service.Obviously from all the complaints I read I would suggest if someone is in a hurry don't come to the drive-through. We ate here and got our food and dessert very quickly. Everybody had a smile and was very friendly. Definitely look forward to returning.Food was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I have been passing this place for about a year and kept wondering.  I just tried it and it beats McDonald's. The food was ok. Nothing special. The service was fast and pleasant  Next time I'll try the frozen custard"}
{"text":"The only thing I can rate is the frozen custard.. I don't know anything about the other food they serve here.  It started with one scoop of vanilla custard in a dish everyday for a week.  Then, I started to crave it more and got 2 scoops... this stuff is so tasty.  I like vanilla better than chocolate and I am not interested in the flavor of the day.  I have been trying to \"break the habit\" of eating this stuff so finally one day I asked for a nutrition guide... turns out 1 scoop of this bliss has 308 calories (more than haagen daas).. so 2 scoops is equivalent to a one hour run... just to put it in perspective.. If you don't care about calories, this  stuff is sweet bliss in a dish!!!"}
{"text":"Culver's has become an institution in our family, having frequented the Deer Valley location when we lived in North Phoenix. Having recently moved to the west side, we were pleasantly surprised to see this new location opening, and we were not disappointed! 

To say this location is different from others in terms of food would be a lie - it's just as tasty as any other Culver's I've stepped into. The chicken strips are some of my daughter's favorites (she's quite the connoisseur of poultry)  and the Butterburgers are quite tasty. I highly recommend getting a Snack Pack - a smaller burger or two piece strip, small fries and small drink, and saving room for desert. The custard is definitely the star of the show!

Kids meals are wonderful here, you get your choice of burger, 2 chicken strips, or corn dog, choice of applesauce or fries, and choice of drink. On the back are two \"tokens\", i.e., coupons; one to save (when you collect ten you can redeem a prize, such as a mini football or basketball) and one to use on a free kids' scoop of custard with one topping. Hint - when driving through, let them know you'd like to use the custard token at the time of purchase.

What did make this particular location stand out for us was the service. Not that they've been bad at the others, but this one seemed just a step above. Smiling, friendly, and helpful employees taking your order, and the employee who brought us our food acted as a waiter - \"Anything else I can get for you? Does everything look right?\" - all done with an extremely positive attitude.

Recommend for anyone looking for a quick bite in a comfortable atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best fast food burgers I have ever had. The Deluxe Butter Burger is incredible. The gristle on the edge of the burger is awesome, all the ingredients are fresh, crisp and you can actually taste everything. I love the options for sides; get the side salad, fresh lettuce, real tomatoes and freshly grated cheddar cheese. I tried the cheese curds but was not impressed. They were very, very salty. That was the only item I disliked. You must have a single scoop custard to top it all off. Absolutely delicious! The restaurant is very clean and modern, the staff is very friendly. I was just a little put off by the food linked Bible versus painted on the walls"}
{"text":"best burgers in Arizona. the staff are so nice. the butter burgers are yummy! the caramel cashew sundae is my favorite."}
{"text":"My very first visit to a Culver's! I was so excited, and proceeded to get recommendations from all of my Midwestern and Culver's-loving friends to help me choose my menu!

I was told that I absolutely, positively had to get the fried cheese curds, and I will say, they didn't disappoint! Served hot and melty, they were yummy from start to finish! Definitely five stars!

Another highly recommended item, the butter burger, was less thrilling. I'm told I have to give this one another chance, because mine was overcooked, rough around the edges, and a bit dry. I'm willing to consider this an anomaly, but it bumped off a star.

Lastly, the custard... Creamy, chocolatey, heavenly! I am told next time I need to get a shake, as they are out of this world!

Lastly, allow me to say that the service at this Culver's was delightful. I asked a lot of questions, and was advised on the best and most affordable way for me to try all the items that had been recommended to me, with a smile and happy grace!"}
{"text":"Culver's is one of my absolute favorite places to eat. This Culver's especially is always clean and has  a friendly staff.  The daily soups, chicken tenders and frozen custard are my favorite."}
{"text":"Great food,  Great staff,  clean environment and restrooms ;) love it"}
{"text":"WE absolutely love the food at Culver's.  No too fond of the new french fries, but there's nothing we can do about it.  This review is based on the poor performance of the drive up workers.  We order to go here quite often, get home and the order is wrong!  Happened again today... I specifically repeated what I ordered before I handed her the money and she stated yes, she had it right. This gets really old.  If these girls would stop chatting with each other and LISTEN when someone is giving the order, there wouldn't be so many mistakes!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, the frozen custard is great. 
I definitely will be coming back here for my guilty pleasure cheat days!"}
{"text":"This place had juicy burgers, crisp fries and yummy onion rings! Took the fam from SF here and they loved it! The kids loved the chicken tenders and the frozen custard! So much yum! It was about $48 bucks for 7 people to eat so not bad! We came hungry and left full and satisfied. Staff was friendly and very efficient, the lines were taken care of in a orderly fashion because it was super packed, but they made it bearable. Will definitely come back for a juicy burger craving! :-)"}
{"text":"Finally got to this stupid place.  God it is far away.  I got a mushroom swiss burger.  It was okay.  I didn't end up finishing it because it was just sort of overly greasy and was making me sick.  Mushrooms can be cooked without being greasy.  I know they can!
The fries were a special kind of terrible.  Crinkle-cut fries are some of my favorites but these just had no flavor.  They needed way more salt.
My shake was a cookie dough shake.  It was okay but the cookie dough pieces were too large for the straw and they didn't give me a spoon.  So by the time I was done, I had a cup full of cookie dough.  Definitely get something different if I go again.
Ultimately I found the menu to be unorganized, the prices to be a tad high, and the drive-thru to be way too slow.  Just not a very good experience for a place that had a parking lot full of people.  Then again, it's not like they have any options in Surprise."}
{"text":"I have been to the Culver's in Surprise and it made me sick beyond reason so it was probably not too smart of me to try eating at this one, but multiple yelpers told me that the Surprise one was the worst and that I should try another one - so here I am.

I don't get this place.  The menu is huge.  It is some weird hybrid of an A&W mixed with Long John Silvers and a KFC.  I wasn't feeling adventurous enough to try sea food or fried chicken so I went with a basic single patty cheese burger, small fries, and small drink.  

Let's start with the fries.  They are crinkle-cut which makes them look cool but they taste bland.  There is so little flavor in these fries, they might as well have been made of tofu instead of potatoes.

The drink? Culver's Root Beer.  Nothing to get excited about and not nearly as good as an A&W or Barq's.

Finally, the burger.  Most burgers come in patty form.  You would expect your burger to have some meatiness to it.  You would expect something juicy.  Not at Culver's.  Here, they give you a beef chip.  Literally this is a piece of meat that has been flattened to the size of the bun.  Unfortunately, they must have started with a really small ball of meat because my burger was only a millimeter thick and was crispy - like a potato chip.  I have included a picture.  Not only was it thin and crispy but it wasn't very good.  The burger was really just a disaster of an attempt at fast food.

I will not go back here.  Fool me once..."}

{"text":"I was watching a Judge Judy show today and JJ was really giving the business to this loser (you know...had bad credit, met a chick, she took a credit card in her name, he didn't pay her back, she's shocked, now they're in court)...she was RIDING his ass. It was awesome. Finally she said \"what planet are you from?\"...Dude with mullet bows his head, darts his eyes from JJ and says \"Why, I'm from Wisconsin Judge Judy\".

LMAO!

Culver's, by way of the Dairy State, has settled on Camelback and Central. Rickie and I ate here after seeing Date Night on our \"date night\". Thought it was a cute, innocent, 1950s way to wrap up our afternoon. You know, kinda like Richie and Laurie Beth. Please, I need to check ID's on this reference. I'm sure Rickie wouldn't pass this one!

Culver's was very clean with well trained and polite employees...think In N Out. We ordered the famous Butter Burgers along with various sides. Burgers. Yum! Sides. Ugh! Would rather have had Ore Ida. Cheese curds had a thick, icky overcooked batter with a Q tip sized cheese curd, fries were limp and sad (kind of like Jesse James career and life now) and the chicken tenders were standard fast food fare.

Root Beer! Outstanding! Smoothie was OK...probably should have went with a good old fashion malt. But who knew?

We had a fabulous booth across from a large open window with a fantastic Sunday breeze cooling our curds. 

I would go back for a burger and root beer. I might even wear a Packers or Brewers t shirt...just to see if I get some free stuff."}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience. Pleasantly greeted by Gabby!!! Lightning fast service. Order made fresh and tasted great. Bathrooms were clean and overall it was a great visit. The cheese curds and the salted caramel custard was a true hit not to mention the root beer float! These guys definitely know how to make you feel good about choosing them. If in the area I will definitely visit. Thank you for being awesome. My vote is to build one in Oklahoma City!

{"text":"So disappointed in this Culvers. We love Culvers and go several times a month. But this Culvers wouldn't even let us pay for extra toppings on our custard. Didn't make any sense as we wanted to pay but they just refused to even give them to us. I can see why this Culvers has lower reviews than any other Culvers in the area.  The management is not interested in making the  customer happy.  I still love Culvers but I recommend a different location!!"}
{"text":"My first thought:  What a strange mix of a menu!

There's butterburgers (what they're famous for), fried chicken, fish, tuna melts, cheesesteaks, salads....and then their other claim to fame, the frozen custard.

I tried the mushroom swiss burger which was very juicy, and the meat had an interesting texture - moist on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside.  The bun was very buttery.  I tried a little of the chili cheese fries, which were pretty tasty and generous...and also tried some of the cheese curds.  I liked the seasoning on the curds and liked that they used two different cheeses.  They were a ton better than those at A&W in my opinion.

Just a warning though, the burgers are so big and filling, there's not a lot of room left in the tummy for sides.  I was SO full.

The custard is smooth and silky, and I'm afraid to say Culver's may give Ritters a bit of competition.    You can get a quart for $5.99.  Every other quart you buy after that first one only costs you $3 each.  The price is extremely reasonable.

I was interested in the fact that you can get what they call regular sides and premium sides.  Anything from regular fries to sauteed green beans.  I don't think I ever had green beans with a hamburger...

Prices are pretty decent, and the staff seems very friendly and motivated.  I didn't see one person just sitting idly.

We'll see if this place stands the test of time, I hope the best for them.  So far I'm liking this place far better than the M or the box, especially in terms of service."}
{"text":"Not my first time at a Culver's- but my first time at this location. Totally screwed up my order at a non busy time of the day. Asked for cheese on my sandwiches, didn't get it on either- asked for two sides of gravy- got one. Asked for buffalo tenders, got their regular. 

That was my payback for not checking my order before going home. If I ever go back, I'll make sure to check my
food thoroughly before leaving the parking lot.

Two stars because the food was delicious, just not what i wanted."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch cause I am donating blood at work today and needed some red meat.  I got the bacon double burger.   It was pretty good.  The fries were not my style they were not very crispy.  I love how they have Wild Cherry Pepsi as it's one of my favorite sodas.  

As I have said in previous reviews I don't give fast food places great ratings because the food isn't great quality and the service is poor as there is no waiter service.  That being said Culver's is ok and they have great ice cream and shakes."}
{"text":"4 stars only for this being fast food, but boy is it good here!!!!! From the minute I walked in I was greeted by a friendly face offering help to decide what to choose from their extensive menu. They have so many options which is awesome. I served a drink and sat down and they came and brought me my lunch. The dining room area was nice and large for a fast food joint! I wish culvers was here northern Cali. Bummer! Lol"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place since it opened, checked out their menu online and went for it. I told the lady at the drive thru that I had never been there before and ordered a salad for work the next day, along with a root beer float for that same night. She offered me a kit kat custard dessert free of charge. You never see that at Dairy Queen, sonic, or jack in the crack. 

While I have to admit to being disappointed in the float (it didn't taste as good as a&w), I still have to give 5 stars because the rest was superb! Even the next day having that salad for work lunch was incredible. It wasn't soggy or gross, it was delicious and they didn't snub me on giving too little chicken like other places do."}
{"text":"The service is very slow. I was the only car in the drive-thru & it took 10 minutes to make my sandwich. I didn't order any sides, just a sandwich & it still took 10 minutes. I went at 11am on a Saturday & there were several workers standing around doing nothing."}
{"text":"Always delicious and hot. The frys are sooo Yuuuumers!. Great fish sandwiches too. The friendly customer service makes it a pleasant and well worth the money experience. Matter of fact, now I want some Culver's.... on my way..."}
{"text":"WHAT A SCAM! I signed up online for offers and coupons...got a coupon in my email for a free scoop of custard of the day...went to pick it up and I was told the coupon HAD to printed...what a scam! It is clearly printed on the coupon to print it or bring it with you on your mobile device...THEY LIED! It's a scam to get you to pay. They lost a customer and I will make sure my friends know to not got there as well.
It's 2018 Culver's! Get current and follow your own printed directions."}
{"text":"I just recently discovered Culvers (I'm probably behind on this one). I've only been to the greenfield location but I absolutely love this place. I usually get a single deluxe with bacon, and a small ice cream treat instead of a drink. I usually eat health but this place is my \"go-to\" for my cheat meal. The prices here are a little higher than comparable burger places, but it's quality food and you get what you pay for. The dinning room is nice, it gives you the feel of a sit down restaurant without being too formal. Last thing, the staff is so nice. Love this place"}
{"text":"WOW!! I have NEVER received such excellent customer service!! After learning of my not so pleasant experience at his store, Jason the store owner contacted me right away. He was extremely pleasant and apologized. He offered to send me certificates for my next visit but then I got a phone call from him and he had left a basket on my porch filled with goodies and a lot of gift certificates. We live out in San Tan Valley so it's a good 45 minutes from his store. He drove all the way out here to personally deliver the basket. Unfortunately the sign fell off my door bell that it's out of order so I was not able to meet him in person. But I will be going back to this Chandler location for sure. He is an owner who takes customer service to a whole new level and truly appreciates each and everyone of his customers. He did tell me that this is his lively hood so he takes it very seriously. Wow, he definitely does! He has talked to all of his staff and I believe that day was just one of those off days, perhaps even on my part. Thank you Jason for really caring!

I had to edit because I was so shocked by the owner's customer service that I forgot to mention how great the food is. The food is what got me hooked on Culvers to begin with. All the menu items I've tried have been really good but my favorite is the sour dough melt, it has grilled red onions in the burger patty. The root beer float is the best ever!! The custard is delicous and the mint flavor is perfect. A nice surprise is their lemon ice. The ice is shaved like fresh snow and the lemon flavor is perfect. My daughters love it with strawberry topping. A nice healthier alternative to the custard."}
{"text":"Always friendly, ready to take your order and very clean. Food is great and especially love the deep fried curds and deserts."}
{"text":"Always greeted when you walk in the door, fast good service, great food and deserts. Clean restrooms and dinning area."}
{"text":"The Mecca for all things fried! I'm obsessed with their cheese curds (how's that for some fried fat?) and their fried pork tenderloin sandwiches. Plus, I love their chocolate custard, and they make a mean chocolate malt!

Check out Culver's - you'll feel like a milkmaid!"}
{"text":"If there was an ability to give more stars we would! We stopped by this culvers one evening to try it. We have returned weekly. The staff is very attentive and the food is awesome! We are recognized by the staff and enjoy our \"off the wagon\" meal. There are many options and we enjoy our visits!"}
{"text":"I ate at Culvers last night, this place is awesome. The food is top notch. Service was fast. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great after a baseball game. Great service all the time. Love the custard. The shrimp is so good and big."}
{"text":"This is not any Culvers; this is a superior Culvers!

This location is always spotless. You will often have a staff member ask if they can put away your tray for you even though it's fast food.  The back area is clean and quiet, with outlets so you can plug in your laptop and use free Wi-Fi (most things at Culvers are cheaper than Starbucks anyways).

They also have daily dollar specials.  These are not published on the website and they change daily.  For example, they may have a $1 sundae, cheese curds, root beer float, etc. Definitely cheaper than paying normal price.  They also don't announce on their website that they have a monthly flavor in addition to their normal daily flavor, chocolate, and vanilla."}
{"text":"I haven't had ice cream in months...well, real stuff.  I have had sugar free ice cream but not \"the good stuff\".  I ate kind of crappy today, so I thought I would let the party continue and get myself a real ice cream.  I stopped by here on my way home from the game.  I ordered a 2 scoop Turtle Sundae.  It was just under $5.00.  Paid the lady my money and they give you a number to take with you and keep on your table.  A few minutes later, they brought out my sundae.  Here is how it was..............

Turtle Sundae-  Just by the looks of it, I knew it was going to be fantastic.  This thing was 2 scoops of vanilla custard, caramel sauce, hot fudge, pecans and a cherry on top.  The first I noticed when I dug in were the pecans.  Good lord they hook them up.  Every single bite had a grip of toasted pecans in them.  They were crunchy, salty and flat out delicious.  They don't skimp on them, that's for sure!  The hot fudge and caramel sauce were mixed in well and the custard was cool and creamy.  It was pretty much a perfect sundae.  I was sad when the spoon hit the bottom of the cup.

I don't know how often I will be back...I need to get back on the wagon of my low carb plan this week.  Their food options look decent too.  I do know one thing though....  If I ever need a sundae, I know where I'm coming for one.  It's only about 5 miles from my house and I really enjoyed the combo of flavors, especially those pecans...they were the star of the show.  The girls working the counter were friendly too."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way down to the airport.  Easy to get to, right off the freeway.  I had been to other Culver's before, but usually just stop for a Turtle Sundae (The best!).  Tonight I went with some food.  I ordered the Culver's double butter burger meal and upgraded to cheese curds.  I had their own root beer to drink.  Here is how it the food was.............

Double Butterburger-  Solid!  Reminded me of a Smashburger.  Semi thin patties, cooked on a flat top so you get a nice little outside crunch.  Very juicy and delicious.  I got it with only onions and cheese.  I would get one again.

Cheese Curds-  Deep fried nuggets of cheese?  I'm listening!  These things were great!  They had a nice exterior batter on them that was seasoned well.  The taste of the batter reminded me of Carls Jrs fried zucchini....same flavor.  I could have eaten way more of those little nuggets of gold.

Me and my brother split a Turtle Sundae for dessert.  This location didn't hook up the toasted pecans as well as the spot by my house in Surprise, but it was still a delicious sundae!  I always have to get one of these whenever I am here.

Service was awesome!  The cashier was really friendly and patient.  She even cracked some jokes when she came out to the dining room to deliver our food.  Good times!

Overall, I will be back.  Maybe not to this one (I have one down the street in Surprise), but Culver's is definitely fine by me.  Solid food and great custard make this a 4 star joint!"}
{"text":"Went to Culver's about 10 min ago. Our 6 year old daughter ordered a corn dog. They took forever to bring out the food. We get home and find an over cooked corn dog that can hardly be described as edible. You be the judge"}
{"text":"We are new to the area...But WoW, they have some of the best ice cream (concrete) I have ever tasted.  The meals are great, and the ice cream is even better.  

If you visit them as often as we do, then down load their phone app.  We found out each location is privately owned.  This means that each location has its own daily special.  The app will tell you what the flavor of the day is at each location."}
{"text":"Saw a coupon in the entertainment book for this place and had never heard if it. Friends said they are as prolific as mcd's in wisconsin and that I had to try the cheeses curds. What? Curds? So I took my son one afternoon for lunch and now we are hooked. Great fresh burgers cooked when you order it. Plus the concrete mixer frozen custard is awesome. My favorite so far is the cherry cheesecake. They have several flavors all the time plus a flavor of the day. Plus an iPhone app which is great!"}
{"text":"For a fast food hamburger, this was pretty good.  I had a regular butter burger single with ketchup, onions, mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato. The flavor was pretty good. They also had sweet tea which I like. For a quick fast food hamburger I recommend it. It also looks like they had a lot of nice frozen custard combinations and quite a few sides to choose from."}
{"text":"My sweet tooth was yelling at me! I had to stop in. Four times (to date) and each time I try something different. Other than the cheese curds (which where just ok) each visit was for the frozen custard. 
VERY RICH and CREAMY a little goes a LOOOOONG way. I have tried a small berry sundae, a pineapple malt, and a small black cherry cheesecake concrete mixer. 

The sundae by far has been my favorite. I love the simplicity, the berries were not overly sweet, strangely artificially thickened. 

The malt was nice and malty which I really appreciated and was rather thick even after melting slightly. 

Now the concrete mixer was the richest of the rich. Maybe it was because I decided to go with a cheesecake flavor (to which you can add any other fruit or topping flavor). It was very tart like cream cheese (about as tart as a good Greek yogurt) with small bits of graham crumbs swirled through and of course the blackberry flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Was greeted when I walk through the door. All employees seemed happy to be there and happy to serve. Was thanked again when I left the restaurant.
Food was piping hot & excellent. The fish sandwich was delicious. My husband liked his single-patty butter cheeseburger.
I really enjoyed my seasonal pumpkin spice shake. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food, and fast service. I went here on a Thursday night with my friend. She ordered a burger and fries and a vanilla mixer with brownie. I ordered a mushroom swiss burger with cheese curds and a peanut butter cup mixer. Everything was prepared according to what we requested. The ice cream came out first then our food."}
{"text":"Love this place. I grew up in WIsconsin so I do know cheese and dairy. I got a mushroom swiss  burger, some cheese curds (duh) and a chocolate concrete mixer with peanut butter cups and oreos. The burger was good, no complaints.... the cheese curds were amazing. I definitely enjoyed them. The concrete mixer was great! The chocolate custard is the best thing since like anything. Will be back."}
{"text":"Culver's is a great place to go for lunch or dinner. A step up from the \"fast food chains\" with the feel of a sit down restaurant, but quick service won't leave you restlessly waiting. The menu Howard is big, easy to read and make ordering clear and painless. Food is then brought to your table and staff are always on hand if you need anything, and will usually be around to collect your trash when your finished. The decor is inviting and plush like and the entire restaurant is kept clean at all times, hopefully that continues as the newness of the grand opening wears off. The patio seating has a fireplace, however I don't think it operational yet. It's a great looking building and just set off enough to avoid the sometimes hectic and depressing Walmart crowd. This will be a spot I visit often, as long as I don't get hooked on the frozen custards."}
{"text":"Don't know what took me so long to try the food here. By far this is my new favorite fast food burger. They make the food fresh and bring it to your table. Only thing I'm mad about is at myself for not trying the food here sooner. I always thought it was kinda like a \"Denny's\" atmosphere. It is not at all! Fast food burger at its best!"}
{"text":"Food is good to the tummy. To me this is better than in and out burger. Place is spotless,  friendly service, and wide selection."}
{"text":"My absolute must-stop dessert place every time I visit Phoenix. The concrete mixers are my favorites, seeing as how you get the joy of ice cream and the benefits of a couple dozen flavor combinations. The mint is interesting, but mixing it with peanut butter cups is not advised. I also enjoy the savory things here. The cheese curds and french fries are equally enjoyable. Sadly, I didn't get chili fries because they were out of chili on my last visit :( Next time in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Food is always out in a timely manner and always hot and fresh. Never had a problem with my order. The staff is always very friendly and the store is always clean. The Buffalo tenders and cheese curds are my fav. Their custard is also amazing no matter what you get!"}
{"text":"Great place for burgers, fries and a shake. The food is fast and fresh and delicious. You get your own condiments and soda/water, but they bring the food and the shakes to your table. You can sit anywhere you want. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ive been to Culvers alot. My son loves it and the cheese curds are A-mazing! I always felt like it was a bit pricey for \"fast food\" until I went to five guys... wow! Id pay the extra money for a butter burger anytime! Culvers is way better than any fast food burger place in Surprise hands down and also better than five guys and half the cost. I will never complain about the prices again. The shakes are good. The burgers and fries are good and as I said before.. cheese curds for the Win! :)"}
{"text":"I got a BOGO coupon in the mail yesterday. C & I decided to try it out & compare it to our experience at BurgerFi.
C ordered a single burger value meal basket which inc fries & drink.($6.19) He ordered the burger with American cheese & extra, extra, extra, extra pickles. He got 7 pickles. Thumbs down from the pickle king. However, C loved the burger. Said it tasted great. The crinkle fries were good he said. Not his favorite but WAY better than last nights salt fest at BurgerFi. 
I ordered the Mushroom Swiss value basket which again inc fries & a drink. ($8.19) I didn't realize this was a double burger. A big burger for me. Yummy good stuff though. Flavorful patties, gooey cheese & enough mushrooms to taste. I agree with C, the fries were ok but nothing special.
Yummy burgers, not enough pickles, average fries. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"This location is across from Carowinds, a large theme park of regional importance.  Just look for the roller coasters and drive right towards them.  The butter burger is a signature item from Wisconsin, as is the frozen custard.  Frozen custard is similar to ice cream, but has a higher butterfat percentage and contains egg."}
{"text":"Out of the world custards. Try out orange cream and caramel cashew for an ultimate experience."}
{"text":"This my first time here and I really enjoyed it. All the employees are very friendly, like a Chick Fil A. I got the limited time Pepper Grinder Pub Burger with Mashed Potatoes and Gravy and I also got a Concrete Mixer with Oreos and Reese's. Ok so the burger was awesome! The pub bread was really flavorful and the combination of the two different cheeses was great. The bacon wasn't to stiff like other places where if you take one bite you pull out the entire piece. The sauce it had on it was also very good. The Mashed Potatoes smells like they use a chicken broth or something in their gravy it was really good as well, not too salty and not too bland. The Concrete Mixer was also really good the ice cream was very soft. I just wish it didn't melt as fast haha. If you're in the area and can't decide what to eat go to Culver's, you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"Had the butter burger with cheese. It actually wasn't a bad burger. The onion rings weren't anything special, but they were good. Partner had the pot roast dinner. The pot roast was very tender and had a nice taste. The meat and mashed were loaded with gravy. If you don't like gravy, be sure to ask for it on the side. The green beans sucked. Hehe

I had the vanilla custard. It was tasteless to me. I'd rather have I've cream.

The staff was great."}
{"text":"I enjoy this location as much as I do the east town location. Both offer great service and good food. Ordered the seasonal pumpkin spice shake (I buy this at least once every fall). Wonderfully thick, rich, pumpkiny, sweet and spicy. Real true pumpkin flavor and not shy on the spice. Love it!"}
{"text":"If I have to pick a fast food burger joint this is it. The burgers are made fresh. Meat tastes real. Fries are delicious. Employees are friendly. Prices are fantastic. The atmosphere is quite different from other fast food burger restaurants. More home-y, and friendly. I can't pinpoint why exactly. Hmmmm... maybe because it's carpeted, and they have televisions up in the corner of the room? I don't know. They have a flavor of the day for their custard each day. Yes I said custard, not ice cream. There's a difference. If you haven't had it before, try it, you'll understand. My favorite reason to stop at Culver's is the turtle sundae. My oh my, I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Home of the butterburger. Enough said, im only giving 3 stars because they are a little pricey. I love the chicken it is so crispy and delicious, and always perfect. Great custard too"}
{"text":"Meh. 

Ate here because I was in town for a grad school interview and this place was close to our hotel. 

Got the chocolate shake, butter burger and onion rings. Everything was okay, prices were cheap (but I'm used to so-cal prices). I definitely prefer five guys or in and out.

They do have a large menu with sandwiches and sides so if I'm ever in the area (though very unlikely) I'd try something else."}
{"text":"I only go to Culvers for their custards. It's super creamy and thick - the best in town! I am a bit of a food purist. So, I only like the classic vanilla. If you want good burgers and fast food, forget about their butter burgers and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The cheeseburgers are on par with Five Guys. The buns are grilled and topped with onion flakes. They are really good. The onion rings are perfect, not too much breading. The custard is delicious, very smooth. The decor is very nice with thick, padded booths and indoor and outdoor seating. The service was fast and delightful. This is a great place to frequent."}
{"text":"great neighborhood staff, the family that runs is  very hardworking serious about their bussiness and satisfying customers. thanks,"}
{"text":"This is my second visit in two years and while I think the food is pretty good there are other places I would choose to go first. 

I went with the traditional butter burger, cheese curds and a chocolate Reece's peanut butter cup concrete mixer. 

The burger was pretty good. I really liked the bun. I also went with the cheese curds which is a nice change up from the normal fries. 

The mixer was ok but not so good that I would go out of my way to have it again. My husband had root beer and it was really good.  

The staff is super friendly and everything is really clean."}
{"text":"I didnt know anything about this place. I saw their ads on tv and decided to try it. We were surprised that its just like a mcdonalds (I hate mcdonalds). We thougt it was a sit down diner but we gave it a shot anyway. What a waste! The burgers were paper thin and bland...nothing like what I saw on tv. And the cheese curds....just like cheese sticks in any sports bar. Typical fast food garbage!"}
{"text":"Sorry, Culver's...I know a coupon has an expiration date in order to  motivate a customer to pop in...but only giving three days & just a dollar off the over-priced heap of grease \"value basket\" has prompted me to indeed take action. No more texts from you. 

I probably wouldn't have noticed had you not sent the \"correction text\" a little while later about how excited you were to offer this dollar and the 72 hour window in which to claim it. Anyway, you can already tell that I'm not a fan but my husband could eat the food so I let you stick around 'til now.  I have plenty of two star reviews that I'm loathe to write...

My first experience was \"ick\" on the burger (edges so burnt and burger rather tasteless) but the chicken sandwich and cheese curds were edible. I thought it was over-priced for fast food. (Watch the up-charges when you substitute, for example \"curds or r-rings instead of fries.\" The food shown, plus two drinks, cost us around $15 and that was after one value basket was even credited \"free.\" They take off just the base value. So I guess this would have been around $20 which is overpriced to me.) The second time, we'd waited forever for husband's food and they messed up the custard order. I'd ordered the caramel one but they brought out some other mixer. It was ok but nothing memorable.

Bugger! I'd wanted a better burger, butter burger so it's bye-bye for now."}
{"text":"I love Culver's! I just think it's the best thing ever. Granted I generally go for a butterscotch milkshake, but I know they have a \"flavor of the day\" they like to offer too. I've had just about all of their salads. My favorite is the summertime strawberry salad (not sure if they offer that one year round). Seriously anything you get will be awesome.

The only reasons this isn't a five-star place is because 1. it's pricey ($4 for a medium milkshake) 2. you're going to be there awhile. Whether you're the only car in the drive-thru or there are 10 cars in front of you, it seems like you're there for about the same amount of time. Worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Very good service, friendly staff, the food is amazing for a fast food chain. I love their cheese sauce, I eat it with everything. Good burgers, good fish, you won't be disappointed here. The quality is consistent."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the burgers and fries. A great flace for some quality fast food. The icecream is pretty good. Great food and service!"}
{"text":"Utterly superb customer service!

There must be at least 47 employees buzzing around like bees.  I was startled by an offer to \"help you right here sir!\" only seconds after entering the front door, before my eyes had even adjusted to the change in light.

Awesome menu offerings and wide selection of choices.+ Fresh not frozen burgers with lots of customization available. + Tasty desserts =

{"text":"My Freddy's Frozen Custard rating 2.5 had been *generously* rounded up to a 3, but no longer....I dropped 'em down. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz/freddys-frozen-custard-and-steak-burgers-glendale#hrid:GvLhtxnxG9PaPbLWxNuq6w

I went to Culver's, basically.

Now I get what Freddy's is trying to be.  Although Freddy's has a mythology that  lays claim to being the originator of the burger style, Culver's just does it better.  

They do everything better.  From friendly customer service, cleanliness, to the fresh and tasty food; and the thick yet crisp on the outside crinkle cut frys were simply a model of perfection on the delicate Greasy~Crispy Spectrum.

The burger?  Even though it was still in the take-two-patties-at-a-time thin style, each of these patties was about as thick as the two put together at Freddy's.   The flavor really proved that it was fresh, not frozen meat pre-grilling.  The meat was cooked all the way through, and yet still juicy.    http://www.yelp.com/biz/steakenburger-long-wongs-phoenix#hrid:K1GltivZImD5el_e8Qg2iA

The basic sundae automaticaly comes with 2 flavors of topping, so they aren't trying to unfairly skrimp you for skrilla left and right with extras.  Very cool, Culver's!   Boo Freddy's for being so lackluster with customer service, overseasoned with food, and generally failing."}
{"text":"This Culver's is always clean and the staff is very friendly & attentive. The custard is to die for, you won't be disappointed! My favorites flavors of the day are the Bonfire Smores, Mint Explosion, Salted Carmel Banana Nut and Double Marshmallow Oreo. Now I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"This is \"our\" Culver's. We visit a few times a month and my inlaws always buy our kids Culver's gift cards for little holiday gifts. At the De Forest Culver's, the staff is friendly, the managers are awesome and the food is way better than the stuff from ordinary fast food chains. It's hot, fresh and Wisconsin-owned. Woot!

The only downside is that it costs, on average, about $25 to feed our family of four there. That's pricey. Thank goodness for my inlaws and those gift cards!!"}
{"text":"We visited Culver's for a quick dinner on a Thursday evening. The food was alright. The cheese curds were large and tasted great, as did the chicken tenders; however, my burger was a bit burnt and was a bit rubbery. The man who took our order was a bit impatient and rude, despite there being no other customers waiting. The woman who brought out our food was quite pleasant."}
{"text":"Awesome burger joint here in Buckeye! Really really enjoyed my burger and fries. Just wish the service was a bit faster, but on the flipside this means they were really taking their time to prep the food."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in AZ so far..

I happened to be staying at a hotel during travel right behind it, and never thought to try it.. I regret that decision.. Easily the best burger I've had so far out here and in speed with an In and Out... not a fan of the fries, curds are decent, and the desserts are legit on a hot day.

West valley has a gem, I will look forward to trying other locations.."}
{"text":"This place kind of reminds me of Dairy Queen- the ice cream and burgers & fries.  Their burgers and fries are even similiar to Dairy Queen's.  I'm not a huge fan of the crinkle cut fries, but the burgers are tender, juicy and tasty.  For some reason I'm usually still hungry after eating here so maybe I need to start adding their frozen custard to the equation.  The restaraunt itself is very new, with flat screen TVs on the walls and cozy little booths.  I've never had a problem with the service either."}
{"text":"I work not far from this place so of course I have eaten there because it is within walking distance. I was not that impressed. Their burgers, I feel, are too greasy and thing. The onion rings are just like any ordinary onion ring. The fries are okay. I have had a salad there and I wasn't that satisfied I ended up not finishing it. 

I could do better by going across the street to Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"A little over a year later, I'm not so sure about Culvers. The food tastes good, but almost too good, like there's a chemical laced in to make you an addict. You know? I suppose this is just a personal taste preference. Honestly, the Butterburger makes me a bit sick to my stomach.

I'd give them 2.5 stars and round up to 3 because I have not tried everything on their extensive menu and it's still a really clean establishment. As far as burgers go, I'd prefer Fat Burger (which is around the corner), or In and Out across the street."}
{"text":"We got the double scoop soft serve and the chocolate shake... These things were amazing... Girlfriend definitely took one look and the whole top scoop fell in her lap in the drive thru... The girl working the window replaced it for free after a good chuckle... Awesome place."}
{"text":"It's a nice alternative lunch spot when I come down for gas refill (because the only other option at that exit is Wendy's... not necessarily a good option). My 2nd time eating there, and I realize their menu offering is huge. Burger, fried chicken, dinner plate, soup, ice cream... I mean, what don't they serve? 
I typically order swiss & mushroom burger (single, on butter bun). It's not the biggest portion. Their burger patty is very thin, which allow them to crisp the outside a little. You can also replace the butter bun with butter (and grilled) sourdough toast. Side order of fries (medium is the size they come with a regular combo) were fresh and crispy. I also tried a cup of soup (stuffed pepper soup), which was pretty good. 
It's not the cheapest joint, they don't have dollar menu or anything like that. But If you are anything like me, I always find the smallest portion (thus cheapest) to order when I'm in a fast food place to feel less guilty, then you can get by with a smaller size combo (small fries & drink instead of medium) for $4ish.

4 stars because:
1. solid food
2. friendly staff"}
{"text":"It is hard to find a great tenderloin sandwich in the Phoenix area. Culvers has it."}
{"text":"This location is open later on the weekends which is awesome for this night owl. 
I love Culvers but tonight I was disappointed. :( I ordered an Oreo and cookie dough frozen custard and got 100% Oreo. :( I didn't mind too much BUT in my little kid voice \" I wanted cookie dough tooooooo!!!\" 
Like I said I love this place but I wish you get what you pay for. :/ you pay for 2 mix-ins. :( I will come back because I love their custard and cheese curds."}
{"text":"Yes I'm a fan. Frozen custard is not my favorite I prefer real ice cream, but they do it right. They have a different flavor every day of the month. Today I checked in at this location and got a free cup of the flavor of the day (caramel cashew). I think they have a pretty good burger also."}
{"text":"I've ordered the cod dinner before and this is another time where they forget to add the tartar sauce or butter for the roll. I mean that's a huge reason why people order fish and chips. I can't tell what's more of an assembly line: a drive thru customer here or the animals at meat industry."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Culver's and now it will not be our last .. Went to the drive through and was greeted by a friendly young man who did not rush me.. We ordered the bacon deluxe and regular deluxe, 2 fries and strawberry milkshakes.. I guess I should have read the menu better because these are 2 large beef patties, dressed with cheese and one with added bacon .. They were served hot, fresh and delicious!! They are huge!! Fries were perfect, crinkle cut and salted !! Strawberry shake was soooooo good, thick and loaded with strawberries..  Glad we stopped and will definitely return soon!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard this place was awesome from a friend so I decided to check it out one day.  Looking at the menu, they have pictures of the burgers which look really really good!! I ordered the mushroom and swiss burger which looked like it might be big enough for 2 people, WRONG!!!!! When it came to the table, it was smaller than a junior roast beef at Arby's!!! Very disappointed especially what I paid for it. I have to say Ive had better sandwiches out of vending machines!! The fries weren't that good either.  I must say I didn't feel all that great after leaving so the chances of me returning are slim to none!!"}
{"text":"Culver's is an unusual place.  From the road, it looks like another Dennys or (gasp) Waffle House kind of joint.  For years I drove past frequently and assumed that's what was going on inside.  Not true, it's actually a more of a fast food joint, but with a massive menu containing more traditional items you'd sooner expect to find at Dennys, plus a ton of dessert items.  It has a large seating area, and is relatively clean.  Employees are friendly and efficient.  Those last several traits you won't find at your local Mickey D's.

They brag about their \"Butter Burger\" being the cat's meow.  Gotta disagree with Sam - it's NOT a better burger than In-N-Out, but it's still pretty decent and of course there's a ton more stuff on the menu than the mighty king of drive-thru burgers offers.  Tonight was my second visit, the first time having the aforementioned burger, which I liked plenty, then tonight I opted for a creation called the \"Wisconsin Double\", which sounds more like something on the menu at a seedy Oshkosh massage parlor than at a restaurant, but I digress.  Rather than a tag team of local masseuses of questionable character, it's actually a patty melt-type of thang, with 2 of the better-than-decent hamburger patties slid between slices of grilled rye bread, topped with swiss cheese and grilled onions.  No additional greasy stuff (mayo, thousand island artery cloggers, etc) added to muck up the formula. That sucker was pretty damn good, and not your run-of-the-mill fast food fare.  For a side (to complete a \"basket\", consisting of entree, side & medium drink) I opted for the cole slaw, which was just barely OK.  The greens were fresh and crispy, but something about the dressing just didn't do it for me.  Last time I was there I opted for the mashed potatoes (Brak LOVES mashed potatoes!) and they were great.. not sure wth I was thinking this time.  Lesson learned.

Didn't have a dessert tonight, but last time had some sort of lemon ice concoction, and it was great.  Lots of interesting desserts on the menu, including something called the \"concrete mixer\", which sounds frighteningly unhealthy, but is probably very tasty.

All in all, a solid 4-star experience, and receives Brak's coveted seal of approval.  Give Culver's a shot, I think you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"This is the newest Culver's in the area, and now it's easy to get Culverized at lunchtime as this one is very close to the office.  Tons of unhealthy comfort food here, but if you order judiciously, you can actually eat pretty healthy here.  The desserts are excellent, the seating is cozy for a fast food joint, several giant TV screens on display, and free wifi.  Brak is a Culver's fan."}
{"text":"We usually come here for frozen custard, but we will dine in when we have a coupon, as it can be pricey. The food is always fresh, hot, and flavorful."}
{"text":"This is, by a wide margin, the best fast food burger.  I get the double cheese burger and I can't put it down when I eat it.  It is delicious, juicy, and hard to stop eating.  I don't pretend it is health food, but for fast food, this stuff is amaizing.  Their fried chicken is also wonderful.  The staff is very sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"I love Culver's as a company, first.  They are solid through and through.  

Each location varies a little, but I think, on the whole, the parent company does enough to keep the franchises in line very well.  I've never been disappointed with any Culver's at which I've eaten.

This location does everything well.  I work near here, so I go here at least once a week for lunch, and have for probably the last four years.  I have never had a single complaint.  Even when they're busy, they manage to keep the place looking well and getting the food out fast and hot.

The only knock I could issue against this place is the layout of their parking lot isn't great.  It could get fixed.  If you park on the right-hand side of the lot, you can get stuck in your space if there's a long line at the drive-thru."}
{"text":"My hubby and I decided to make a quick stop somewhere, to take a restroom break and of course to get something to snack on before heading back on the road to LA.  We've never heard of Culver's so we took a chance on it since it was off the freeway.  It looks like a brand new location, since it looks so new from the outside.  We find out it's a ice cream type of place with burgers and fries.  Their sign says their known for their frozen custard, which sounded pretty darn yummy despite the fact that it's SO cold outside!  So we went in, and the customer service was pretty good.  The young ladies would ask if we were ready to place our order, and once we told her not yet she told us to take our time.  Their interior was pretty nice and clean, as well as their restroom.  Their menu selection consisted of lots of burgers and frozen custard treats and milkshakes.  We ended up getting one strawberry milkshake, and one brownie batter item.  The milkshake was PRETTY DARN GOOD!  The brownie batter was good too, but I enjoyed the milkshake a lil better.  So if you're looking for a good fast food sweets place if you're in AZ, be sure to check out Culver's!"}
{"text":"I just don't get the hype.

I guess I never had a butter burger before, and I've from the midwest.  I had never heard of this place before.  I didn't think the frozen custard was anything great either.  My hamburger was fine.  Nothing special.  Maybe I'll have to go again to see if I change my mind.  Everyone seems to love this place!"}
{"text":"Good location and easy access. I was happy with the food and dessert. I am always a big fan of Culver's and this location is no exemption."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way home from the dells for a quick lunch. The staff was friendly and the restaurant  was clean. 
Our kids each had a cheeseburger kids meal which came with fries or applesauce and choice of a drink (we did milk). Also on the kids bag there is a coupon for a free scoop of ice cream with your choice of toppings! Even on this cold day the custard was amazing! My husband had a butter burger and fries. Everything was tasty!!"}
{"text":"Took our friends from California. They wanted to try a place not in California. I had heard about Culvers.. We ordered and the burgers are excellent. Our friends and my family where both very impressed. Service was very.good. This was a place I would uo against any California hamburger jpint!"}
{"text":"First off the place was very clean ! I love the lighting it was bright but not too bring! Music wasn't blaring! Thanks so much Karen it was our first time and she told us first timers get a little sample custard of your choice! I also asked about the salads and she was very knowledgeable in the menu I can't wait to come again! It's just so much I want but can't eat at once ! Thanks you guys are awesome and the foods amazing!! I'll be back and the word is going out !"}
{"text":"I ordered the cheddar burger with fries and a heath bar concrete mixer.  Upon placing my order I asked for ketchup for my fries.  Although the gentleman taking my money was very nice and enthusiastic he seemed distracted and just kind of \"uh huh'd\" me.  I pulled over to parking spot #2 to wait for my order and I waited...and waited...and waited....I finally got my order with a big grease mark on the bottom of my bag which I was unaware of and got grease all over the seat of my car!  GROSS.  The burger was just ok, very heavy.  It actually gave me a stomach ache for a little while.  The fries were nothing special and I  did not get ketchup for them as requested!!!  The concrete mixer I ate a little later when my stomach was feeling better and that was really good.  It is the only reason I gave culver's 3 stars.  The burgers are not so great.  I would take in and out over this sloppy mess of a brick any day!  I have to say, this food was NOT worth $13!!!!"}
{"text":"I know that people swear by Culver's as the next best thing since sliced bread and it's good. But it ain't THAT good. I had a decent burger that was well assembled and easy enough to eat other than being a tall stack. You know how some burger places (Jack-In-The-Box) advertise a burger that looks awesome in the ads but is a letdown when it's on your tray? Well that didn't happen to me here at Culver's. You can see from my own picture. Nice.

I also got a chocolate malt custard shake to go home for the Mrs. That was a big hit.

Okay, so I was going to go with \"A-OK\" but I think it's good. Better than what I expected. I'm leaning towards \"I'm a fan\" so there you go, Culver's. Four stars. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I really wanted an In-N-Out burger, but there isn't one in the neighborhood. As I was driving along, the Culvers sign caught my eye and I figured that I would still be able to satisfy my craving for a top notch burger.

I chose to go for the classic ButterBurger, though I let the clerk talk me up into a double with the toppings. I'm sure all the others, with bacon or swiss cheese oare fine, but it was the Deluxe that sold me. Onion, tomato, lettuce and cheese on a fresh bun. It was some good eats.

I'm not a huge fan of their fountain offering and I was glad that I checked before splurging on a cup for soda that I would have filled with water. I wanted a non-caffeine and low calorie choice (there were enough calories in the burger, thanks!), but there wasn't one. Water it is.

A couple of TV's were on and they do have a wi-fi signal as well.

Next time, I'll try the custard!"}
{"text":"Yummy! The burgers were delish, fries were nice and crispy.  Employees were super friendly and not to mention the food was out in about 5 minutes!!! Not to mention their ice cream was amaze balls (today's flavor was Oreo cheesecake).  Only bad thing was that there wasn't a bigger burger to eat"}
{"text":"If fast food is what you are looking for. Or ice cream you can stop now. This is the place. The burgers are great (fast food burger) the fries are yummy and the cheese curds keep me coming back. I love the root beer! It is amazing- the ice cream is fantastic. Try it. You will seeeee"}
{"text":"Culvers has awesome hsmburgers and fries. Nsughte food but dometimes you judt hsve to be naughty. Value basket and turtle sundae sre the most decadent snd yummy. Ok today just salad snd dieters tea from the 99 cents store."}
{"text":"The service at the Chandler location was so awesome! They really made us feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Cheese curds.....yum. The custard, extra yum. The service, almost always great. Today the cashier was a bit of a snot. The fried chicken was the show stopper today. I would have never guessed you can get chicken that good there. AND the fries are the ONLY fries offered by a national chain that gives McDonald's any competition."}
{"text":"We made a quick stop on the way home. Quick service. Good food. Hamburgers and shakes. Would stop again when in the area."}
{"text":"So displeased! I was really looking forward to trying them out, menu looked good and they profess to have such high quality and yet I found trash in my food as I was nearly halfway done eating it. I asked to speak with the manager and they tried to pawn me off on a training shift supervisor who went in back to speak with the actual manager and came back to try to tell me the piece of rubber I found in the bbq pork was a tendon. I re-requested to speak with the manager and she was completely apathetic and said I could talk to the owner. The owner's answer was and I quote \"I eat this all the time and have never gotten sick.\" They said, \"It comes to us premade.\" Really?!?! Never made any suggestion that he would check the batch for more debris or that he would make the distributor aware there was a problem. They just went on serving it. It was when I said he can't serve this crap to people he told me to leave. I shiver in disgust! Worst quality and customer service I've ever seen."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews about the drive-thru. It's just such an oddly spaced area with the line going through normal parking spots. When it came to getting our sundaes though, the service was pretty quick.

I came here for dine-in once as well. I didn't have a problem with my order or the food coming. I'm new to Culver's in general, so I feel like the number system is super inefficient. Poor employees have to go all around the store looking for me.

Coupons in the mail are great, so I'll be here a few more times."}
{"text":"I went here last night because all my mid-west friends said it was amazing!  I have to say I was very disappointed!  Not to mention that I'm pretty sure my burger had a piece of bone or rock in it.  I bit down and seriously thought I chipped one of my molars.  

Do yourself a favor and go to In N Out or for that matter McDonald's!"}
{"text":"I got a burger here.  I don't get why they don't at least try to make it good by putting in produce.  Serious waste of money.

If I were judging it on the frozen custard alone, it'd get a four star.  The humanitarian in me wants to warn everyone of the other foods!  That's why it's a two star--that frozen custard is pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"First time to Culvers but won't be our last. The food was hot, fresh and very tasty. Had the double original butterburger and it was delicious - could tell it was chargrilled, not processed or frozen. Fries were crispy but soft. The chicken tenders and malt were also very good. My daughter loved the green beans side. The staff was very friendly and helpful with great customer service. So glad this location is convenient."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way to Dane County Regional Airport.  The free wifi was great to be able to use before getting on a plane.  We had plenty of time to eat our meal without being rushed.  We were there for a late afternoon lunch, so it was pretty quiet in the restaurant even though they had a fair amount of customers coming through (we were not the only ones in the restaurant by far).  The food was excellent and our order came as requested and with a smile!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful.  The food was great as always.  We came here for a late dinner after flying into the airport.  The staff was ready to take our order.  When our meal came to the table, one of the staff members asked us if we needed anything else.  At the end of our meal, the same staff member took our trash for us and wished us a nice evening and that he hoped we would be back soon. All in all, a great experience again."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, and overall a consistent experience! My go-to favorites are the chicken sandwiches and buffalo chicken strips topped off with one of the custard desserts.

We constantly go out of our way for dessert as the quality is top-notch and the service is fast."}
{"text":"I was out of state for a big race at the Canyon Raceway Park over thanksgiving weekend. I was dying to try something quick but different from the typical California chain restaurants. This place filled the void. It was tasteful for the typical burger and I felt happy knowing it was something new."}
{"text":"Let me start off my saying that being from Wisconsin I love all things Culvers.  If it wasn't for my wife keeping me on the straight and narrow I'd probably be eating here a couple of times a week.  It's that good.  I like to get their kids meal (team scoopie meal).  It comes with a cheeseburger, small order of french fries, a drink along with a free scoop of the day and a ticket that if you save up ten you get a free meal, all for just over five bucks!  Can't beat it with a stick.  They make their own root beer which is very good as well.  In today's fast food nation, they do a good job of recreating the old timey burger stand from the 'good ole days'.  It's not fast food, it's good food quickly.
  Great burgers, great malts, great custard."}
{"text":"Restaurant review:
Butter burgers and frozen custard, a midwest staple for on the road or just when you crave burgers. The butter burgers that are never frozen taste a lot better than McD, but it can't beat the 5 guys burger which is right next door. The crinkly fries are good, but once again you can top 5 guys. Frozen custard is always delicious and goes well in a waffle cone. Servers are friendly and it is very easy to order the food. This place also must have gone under renovation, because it looks better than went I last went. This time around I made the mistake of ordering the pork tenderloin. I don't know what is suppose to go on it, but a plain pork tenderloin is very dry... That was my bad.

Pro: lots of coupons for savings in the mail, a solid butterburger and frozen custard

Cons: it is pricier than other fast food options, weird parking lot configuration

Hidden gem:

{"text":"Horrible, the best thing is ice cream.  I've been here 3x in the last 2 months and the food is not well made. Got a burger meal last night and half the ingredients weren't even in the burger, chicken sandwich was cardboard. All serous and done spent $30 it hard earned money to get horrible food."}
{"text":"It is a classic Culver's. Decent hamburgers and crinkle fries and other things to choose from. They also have ice cream, frozen yogurt but my favorite is the frozen custard. Many different flavors to choose from and an overall good fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I was excited to take my husband for his first experience at culvers. We decided to order hamburgers and a concrete mixer through the drive-through. After we received our bag, we we noticed we were missing a hamburger and had to enter the Restaurant to get our missing hamburger. Once we got the missing hamburger we noticed that the patties were burned, all the toppings were missing, and the buns were flat. Maybe they were just busy but we won't be returning to this Culver's."}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru on my way back to my hotel in Verona and it was a pleasant experience.

I pulled up and was greeted with a happy voice.  I ordered a chocolate malt and a crispy chicken sandwich.  Both were awesome.  The malt was top notch and the chicken sandwich tasted really fresh.

They didn't have my order ready when I got to the window, which was fine, and they had me pull to forward and park.  This is good but the people behind me had a hard time getting by me because the space to move forward and where I parked were so small.  It was just more weird than anything.

All in all, the experience was good and the food was awesome."}
{"text":"I like their food but the custard is what makes me come back every time. It's so yummy and the flavor of the day is always interesting. Take advantage of their weekly specials."}
{"text":"It was good for fast food. But nothing special."}
{"text":"I once had a friend who dreamt of cheeseburgers. In fact, she described that in her dream she was standing in front of a hotel made out of a cheesburger! Drippy cheesy goodness made up the swaying curtains that pulled away from the windows. Each condiment represented a different floor of the building--and that it smelled like the bestest cheeseburger ever! 

The day I ate a Culvers Double Butter Burger with Bacon, I knew exactly what she was saying! Buttery Delicious Goodness are the words that come to mind! And... after surviving on a 500 cal/day diet for 3 weeks I even admit to having dreamt of a cheeseburger to this caliber! 

The custard is fab--the customer service is the best you'll see at a fast food place--its your down-home kinda joint--for every family to enjoy! Go in deep---and you'll come out smiling everytime at Culvers!!! :-)"}
{"text":"The good? Well it is better than Pete's.

When my mom was in town this Spring I decided to buy her dinner at Culver's after a few people recommended it. My aunt strongly recommended the seasonal walleye so I went for it.

First off this review is partially my fault. I'm an active Yelper. It is usually my fault when my expectations are off. I expected a casual sit down place like Denny's or Big Boys. So it is my fault for not doing my homework.

Second, it is less fast casual and more fast food. I got the impression from a few people that this was a fast casual place. But it felt more like McDonald's with a few seasonal specials to me.

Third. The food. My wife thought her friend chicken was okay. My walleye was better than Pete's and other fast food joints. But on par with decent fish and chips? No. And it cost more than my last trip to our favorite fish and chips joint.

The restaurant even looked messier than most McDonald's I've been to.

Next time, I'm going to remember to check before offering to treat family to dinner even if I have a recommendation. Because this place was disappointing and I would've rather spent the money to buy some fish, oil, beer, potatoes and make dinner for twice as many people for the same price."}
{"text":"I don't know why anyone would ever come back here? I'm so confused how they stay in business. I ordered a Sourdough Melt that looks really good on the menu with a few layers of meat but it's a burnt sandwich and the cheese is literally thicker than the meat. I took it back and they stood by it saying their meat is pretty thin. She offered to make me another one but if there was nothing wrong with the first one in their eyes why would I want another one? Worst sandwich I've ever had. Will never come back. Not offered something else or a refund..."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place.  I have not had a chocolate malt as good as this since I was a kid.  We had to wait a little longer than usual (or so they thought) and brought us a coupon for our next visit.  Then we went back and we wanted to switch the coupon for something else, but they couldn't do it.  So we order malts again, just one.  We had to wait again and one of the boys came out and said we made an extra by mistake, do you want it?  Duh of course.  So we got two for the price of one.  Most excellent.  LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Being a member of the coastal elite, I've managed to accidentally avoid Culver's my whole life - who knew this Great Lakes region fast food standard had made it to my new home court in the Southwest?

You gotta respect the Wisconsin-ness of doubling down on the dairy products and literally adding them to everything. You like burgers? How 'bout the BUTTER burger!  You usually get fries with that? Replace them with fried CHEESE CURDS! And why have ice cream when you could add EGGS and have a frozen custard!  Gotta be honest, it works, and it establishes Culver's as unique compared to BK or McDs. 

Culver's is bound to go full KFC Double Down and release a butter burger with a layer of cheese curds and a fried egg - its in their DNA, and you know you'd try it!  Release it for football season and call it the Cheesehead for the Packers fans, or give a nod to the health downfalls of fast food, add bacon, and call it Culver's Last Stand. Msg me for more US History and NFL themed burger ideas, Culver!"}
{"text":"Recently went for lunch, not our first time. The hamburger patty was paper thin, so thin the outside edges were crispy crunchy. Practically nonexistent. They need a roped off waiting line at the counter. We've seen anger issues between customers when people cut-in lines."}
{"text":"This is the best Culver's is Wisconsin.  The staff is always friendly, the environment is always clean, and the food is always fresh!  We appreciate this store's dedication to great service during a time when most companies are only focused on their own needs.  We'll keep going back!"}
{"text":"First off, a confession.  For quite some time, I actually thought their logo read \"Better Burgers\" as opposed to \"Butter Burgers!\"  Which, I'm sure was probably a deliberate calculation by those who designed it because even if you don't completely misread it like I originally did, it still works on a subliminal level.

But of course one of the main reasons it took me so long to realize what their signs said was because they DO offer \"better burgers\" so it made sense!  Their burgers aren't just delicious - they're downright ADDICTING!  I can get some pretty serious cravings for one.

But the truly amazing thing about this place is that they mainly promote both their burgers and their ice cream - both of which are top notch and will leave you coming back for more - and yet just about everything they serve will leave you pleased.  Most restaurants have their specialties and other items that leave something to be desired.  But everything I've eaten at Culver's has been 100% delicious - I especially love their chicken dinners and their mashed potatoes are a huge favorite of mine.

Being right across the street from the bookstore I often frequent, Culver's is usually the perfect place to go to immediately afterward and unwind with my new reading material.  Food that treats the mouth, relaxed atmosphere and fair prices all add up to a completely positive experience regardless of if they're really better burgers, butter burgers, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter burgers or Parkay burgers!"}
{"text":"Always consistently good. Just good fresh burgers, crisp fries, good customer service too. My apologies nay regret is that they no longer have strawberry soda. That was the absolute best. Still the very best fast food option in my opinion."}
{"text":"we ate here last night and my husband and son have been so sick since! they were throwing up all night! i called and spoke to the manager and pretty much all he said was thanks for bringing it to his attention....if you feel like hugging a toilet all night then definitely check this place out! sloppy undercooked food!"}
{"text":"Five things you should know about Culver's:

#1.  While considered fast food, no need to get all Eric Schlosser on Culver's.  Family owned.  Treats workers fairly.   Good quality food.  
#2.  They sell fried cheese curds.  As far as I know, it's the only fast food joint that does this.
#3.  You can replace your soda with a shake.
#4.  But you might not want to because their root beer is really tasy.
#5.  Butter Burger - it's just as tasty and as unhealthy as it sounds.

The fast food of choice when in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"OMG so I'll admit I just love a good greasy burgers, so this place hit the spot! Let's top that with frozen custard and a deal a struck each and every time.  Prices were comparable to other spots so no complaints there and the place was clean; what more could I ask for!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. Not very good food & no imagination ... a melt was extremely yucky!  Service sucked and the boy at the counter was very unenthusiastic & I felt didn't even want to help us.

Never again."}
{"text":"Cashiers usually very friendly and efficient at taking orders. Those makes it enjoyable to visit. Sometimes a less than happy person is cashiering though.

Fish always great here."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and this is a great location, although parking can at times be a bit tight.  One time I sat in the dining room and Mr. Craig Culver himself brought my order to my table!  Very cool that a guy with 500+ franchised locations finds time to still \"keep it real\" and deliver food to the customer!"}
{"text":"Great service, great hamburger , cheese curds were awesome. What more need I say. My New favorite fast food place."}
{"text":"I decided on Culvers for my Super Bowl meal. I ordered a burger value basket at the Drive Thru.  I pulled up to the window and gave my credit card and punch card to the cashier. She looked confused and asked me what this was. I explained that she should stamp it and give it back. She asked the manager and she said they didn't honor them any longer.  I also have another card that is almost full!!

They did not handle it well. No I'm sorry or anything.   So  I asked for my punch card and credit card back and went across the street to Carl's Jr. Got a great meal with quick service. 

Poor customer relations."}
{"text":"We like CULVERS a bunch for a lunch break :-) 
Nothing crazy nothing fancy nothing spectacular or even unusual!  Just a simple eatery with decent food. Great service and very clean."}
{"text":"Where's the BEEF?  My husband and I just had a bread burger!  I didn't order a double burger because the pictures made the burgers look so big...not so much in real life.  $6.99 for a value meal is no value either. :("}
{"text":"I like this Culver's location. I always use the drive through and I appreciate that they have good staff. There is the usual wait for burgers but I don't mind the wait for a freshly cooked burger (as compared to other fast food burger places where they have been sitting around). Fries are very good, as well as the onion rings. I love the mushroom and swiss burgers! Of course, the custard is great, comparable to the popular custard place that was in my hometown growing up. I've been to a few different Culver's throughout the area and I like this one in particular because the staff actually seem interested in their jobs and provide good customer service. As an example, and I know this probably seems minor, but on a hot Phoenix day, if I order a waffle cone and custard, they'll sit the cone in a medium sized soda cup so the custard is not dripping all over the place. Very much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here when there are other locations to choose from with the exact same menu. The drive thru is the slowesttttttttttttttttttttt of anywhere I have ever been. Parking lot is very congested, bad set-up. The deal breaker, not even a thank you. Avoid."}
{"text":"I love the concrete mixers. I don't like the attitude of one of the employees. She usually works the drive they window. Tonight she made the ice creams. We ate inside. She she brought them to the table she almost slammed both of them down. All the other employ are fantastic. Every employer has just one unhappy employee. Will still come here for the ice cream."}
{"text":"Pretty good drive thru food. Had a pork tenderloin sandwich, onion rings. Wife had burger and fries. Pork sandwich came out hot, crunchy. Could use some seasoning, but still good. Rings good and crispy. Solid burger and fries.
Food made to order. A little pricey for fast food, but hell, nothing is cheap anymore."}
{"text":"So last time we just went for the burgers. Tonight we went for desserts. And man oh man, it was spectacular! I just love how nice every worker there is!! We went inside and everyone gave us a genuinely friendly hello. And they were happy to help us with our order.
We got a mint Oreo and brownie concrete. Holy cow! It was amazing!!! Best shake/concrete I have ever have hands down!"}
{"text":"As usual, the service here was pretty good :) everyone was very kind! 
We love Culvers, but mostly decided to eat at this location the other day because they have gluten free buns. I LOVE cheeseburgers, so anytime there's Gf buns I wana try them! 
The buns were just ok, they were the usual, very dense. To the point where it's like 80% bread and not much anything else. But the bun was still in the bag, so it was great to know there was 0 chance of cross contamination!
And I'm still thankful that they even have them! And that we had somewhere to eat! (Especially since I was feeling betrayed after finding out Blue Lemon closed!)"}
{"text":"Not a fav. They have good Oreo custard cement mixers and cheese curds and that's about it for me. Their burgers are supposedly amazing but then again, I'm not much of a burger person."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to grab a quick bite buffalo chicken tenders and my boy got a concrete Heath bar. The staff was friendly, nice and clean and clean bathrooms! Quality food, I'll be back"}
{"text":"I have been here many times for their custard.  The custard this time was icy from a texture perspective.  Seems that they may be adding more ice/water and less cream.  Cutting expense?"}
{"text":"I wanted some frozen custard so off we went. The line in the drive through was super long and it took a while to move but once it started moving, it went fast. The lady taking our order was very friendly, super patient. 

I ordered a kids meal for my son - the butter burger with cheese. I will say that I asked him for a bite and ended up taking two. That burger was so good! When we come back, I will definitely get a burger for myself. I don't know what their secret is but that burger was good. 

The frozen custard was everything. They messed up my order but I didn't feel like being bothered with going back inside. I was supposed to get two chocolates but they only gave me one. They did give me an extra free custard with the order so I guess that is why I didn't go inside to fix it. They tried. But the custard is creamy and smooth and very flavorful. I just love custard.

And we ordered the cheese curds. These were everything too. I didn't want to share. Minus the initial shock of paying $3 and some change for a little serving of it - it ended up being a lot of curds in the bag. 

When we want to treat ourselves I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was kinda disappointed that the chain (or maybe just this location) was a downgrade of quality locations.  The custard isn't quite the same as I remember from 5 years ago and the burgers, well, just mediocre but priced like Angus."}
{"text":"My first visit and my eyes were gleaming about how a franchise in California could do so well. The place was clean and well lit. The burger I ordered was truly buttery, as they advertised and no weird fillers to pick out. The burger tasted so good I didn't feel the need to add mustard or extra mayo. My rootbeer was crisp and light and that frozen custard was just divine!  I will most certainly be back before I leave Phoenix."}
{"text":"Forewarned that I only have 1 visit to base this review off of.

First off any restaurant that gets a 4 star means they're good, when a FAST FOOD restaurant gets that's a wow!

On a business trip in Charlotte and was heading out of town and needing a quick bite we decided to stop. A 4 star fast food joint? Must try it...

First off for a fast food spot it's clean, restroom for men not smelly nor in shambles, dinning room free of overflowing trashcans and stray wrapper flying around.

Customer service was on point, felt as composed as In & Out in CA. Orderly and everyone getting the job done. The staff taking the orders, the cooks to the staff delivering your meals.

Culver's claim to fame is they toast the bread with butter. This along with your non traditional patty not like other restaurants, but with a patty flattened/pressed on the grill so the edges are crispy. So so tasty. I had the mushroom Swiss burger and bacon. Very tasty and recommend it.

All in all, good service, good food, clean location... What more do you need? Buon appetito."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good, they seem to melt in your mouth. Only downside is that they seem a little on the small side to me. Also a little too greasy, but what's a burger without the grease right? The cheese curds are awesome and their frozen custard is a must have. It does suck if you go through the drive thru because they seem to take a little too long. However, there is a sign before you get to the window that warns you about the wait time. So it should be expected I guess."}
{"text":"I like this Culver's. It's close to work, close to home, and service has always been speedy and friendly. 

It's your typical Culver's restaurant - has the same basic layout. Everything has been kept nice and clean every time I have been inside. 

I typically choose the drive through, though. The attendants who take my order and the ones who greet me at the window have always been great. The line can get long during peak hours, especially at lunch time, however the wait is never as long as I expect it be."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars for two reasons: 

1.) I love the food. It's my guilty pleasure. 

2.) I just had an incorrect order (hey, it happens everywhere!) and the General Manager, Robert, handled it like a boss! He took care of my issue right away & was very apologetic. You can tell this guy is great at customer service!!"}
{"text":"My family goes to Culver's about once every other month. I love the Butter Burgers and cheese curds (which I had never had prior to going my first time).  One time I did have the grilled chicken sandwich and I was very disappointed. It was dry and salty, not at all what I've come to expect from Culver's food. Every time we've gone the service has been great and everyone has been super friendly."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 10 stars if I could! It's such a refreshing change from all the norms. The service is always exceptional, the food is fresh and tasty. There is a huge variety, so everyone is happy. They make their own root beer, which they combine with their custard to make a heavenly root beer float. I'd go here hands down, every time, given the alternatives here in Surprise."}
{"text":"This review is for the location at 83rd Avenue and Thunderbird in Peoria. The food is decent but this review is more about the service which is consistently poor.

The drive-thru staff here is incompetent. Three times I ordered a cheddar burger and it came with American cheese.

The first time his happened I called and complained and they said sorry and it wouldn't happen again.

The second time this happened he drive-thru girl asked me if I wanted cheese. Well, yes I do, that's why I said CHEDDAR. I suspected they messed up so I checked my order and indeed they did. I went back inside and waited five minutes before I could get waited on and they said they would make a new one and I could keep the first one. It took ten minutes for them to get me what I actually ordered.

The third time, well this is when I write a review. I'm going to stop going here.

If you insist on going here, check your order before you leave.

Also, I should add, fast food workers have recently demanded a $15 per hour wage. Guess what, you don't deserve it! Any idiot can screw up and order. Paying them more isn't going to fix this."}
{"text":"I have been waiting on one of these places to move down South! Once I heard that it was opened we drove down the next weekend. It is quite far, but definitely worth the drive, Quality fast-food with delicious butter burgers and concrete mixers! Try this place out. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Do not get it I ordered a burger and fried and have to say i was not impressed at all. To me this place is over priced for what you get. I guess the marketing ads did it for me to get us to go but hard for me to go back  for me I will drive to Watson for a better meal"}
{"text":"Yummy is all I can say.  My partner is from Milwaukee, Wisconsin so she was in heaven when we were on vacation in Phx and we found a culver's.  She always prefers Leon's, but this is a close second.  The store is clean, everyone is friendly and the service is good.  They will give you a sample of any flavor to try before buying.  My only complaint is they dont have coke products, just pepsi.  Ick."}
{"text":"Adequate hamburger.  Asked for mustard...they kind of put some on but I didn't get to it until I was halfway done."}
{"text":"Better than most fast food joints.
Clean dining room with free WiFi.

What more to ask for?"}
{"text":"I wrote 4 times on your contacts page on your website about a problem and still no answer from your management! Your answer on facebook is to go on our site and write a detail report and still no response.Customer service is not good at your company."}
{"text":"On a snowy night I think half the town of Waunakee decided to pick up dinner (our other choices are McDonalds or Taco Bell/KFC).  Thanks to a kind driver I was somehow able to pull into their lot and weave carefully through a full parking lot avoiding customers to get to the drive thru lane.  It was minimum eight vehicles deep.  Culver's prides itself on making food per order, so I expected to take awhile.  And was okay with it as I really didn't want to cook tonight.  The vehicles moved.  I was surprised at how quickly they did move.  I again had to wait to get my food, but the time period from when I pulled in line to when I left was less than 20 minutes.  The staff was young, but extremely patient and friendly.  With as many orders as they did in a row it was a very pleasant surprise.  The food was what I expected.  The only thing wrong was somehow I ordered two family packs of French fries, but I paid for two and when they forgot one they made sure to stop me before leaving without the second.  Is it gourmet?  No, but it's good for fast food and worth the few extra dollars.  As I was waiting I could see inside and it was clean and well-lit.  I cannot think of any suggestions from this visit."}
{"text":"People rave about their butter buns, but I don't taste anything different than any other regular hamburger.  Their custard/yogurt/ice cream is really good, of course.  But as far as food-wise, nothing to write home about.  I do admit, their crinkle cut fries are pretty good - they were crunchy and had just enough salt on them.  Our son had the kids meal which came with a free custard (you have to tear off the coupon off of the kids meal bag - easy to miss if you don't pay attention to what's written on the bag)."}
{"text":"Ugh, these places are terrible.  I'm not really sure why the husband and I decided to give them another shot, maybe because they're in a nicer part of town or maybe we were just being nice, who knows.  

We decided to go inside the restaurant this time to see what they were all about and it's just a little overwhelming and quite a bit claustrophobic.  There is so much going on in here, with a huge backlit menu above the registers, a good number of TV's blasting some basketball game, and the cacophony going on in the kitchen.  After about 10 minutes of trying to figure the menu out, we decide to order and then wait about another 10 minutes while the guy pushing the buttons figured out how to do a stupid cheeseburger with just mayo and ketchup.

We waited a little while for our food to come out and the same look of disappointment from my last experience spread across my face when I saw my burger.  I got an ill formed patty with ridiculously cripsy edges and haphazard construction.  I ate it and it really sucked.  At least I didn't get sick this time.  The only good things about this place are their fried cheese curds and some promising concrete flavors.  Aside from those two things, I will never eat anything else from here again."}
{"text":"Okay, I was super excited about this place when I finally realized what it was while we were in the drive-through.  I wasn't excited however about their complicated menu.  I did the build your own combo thing and I just wanted a single patty cheeseburger with bacon on it.  I got the cheese curds as a side because... well how could I not.  Fried cheese.  After pulling past the pay window we waited for a good 7-10 minutes for our food.  That was irritating.  I like the whole made-to-order thing, but Jack In the Box manages to do it faster.  I gobbled up all my cheese curds within moments.  Ya, they were really good.  There was a mix of white and yellow cheese in there.  The flavor of them was just delicious.  Unfortunately, my burger was all sorts of wrong.  I opened the wrapping to find a ridiculously misshapen double cheeseburger inside.  I wanted one less patty and some bacon.   I guess that was too much to ask.  Anyway, it looked unappetizing based off of the strangely shaped patties and the fact that it was so greasy I couldn't get my hands to grip it without crap falling out the other end.  I probably wouldn't go back unless I was just getting a snack.  The cheese curds are great, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for dinner. 
For a fast food place, it is very overpriced.The butter burger was dripping with grease, and was otherwise fairly bland. 
The cheese curds are tasty, but the fries are merely average. 
The chicken sandwich was decent at least."}
{"text":"This place has a lot to offer... from burgers and chicken tenders to fish sandwiches! Lunch time may be a bit of a doozy when it comes to the parking maneuvering with drive-thru traffic, but if you have time to sit for a second, then I would recommend going inside; it's worth it. 

The entire menu is made fresh... so much so, I my chicken tenders were still sizzling when I got them (nothing a few cool-down blows couldn't handle). They also offer milkshakes which is always plus for me. 

I will definitely try them again!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Culver's whenever I'm driving between Minneapolis and Chicago. It's conveniently located right off of the interstate about 10 minutes north of all the Madison exits. And when you pull up outside you'll immediately notice that the parking lot is packed with cars. This is the sign of a good place!

As for the food, there's really nothing special about it. I like the fact that the burgers are smash grilled and that the buns are buttered. They're not healthy by any stretch of the imagination but if I were forced to pick between McDonald's, Burger King, or Culver's I'm going Culver's.

As for this location, it's clean and well kept and the staff are always friendly. The bathrooms are also clean which is important for the weary traveler.

I can't give this place 5 stars because fast food chains certainly don't warrant that sort of rating but it's quite solid nonetheless. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is awesome! Delicious burgers and amazing Ice cream and custards. The butter buns used with burgers are so tasty!"}
{"text":"If you are craving for sweet but don't want to get out of the car in 100 degree weather,  this is the place to be.  I ordered a mint chocolate with browie and it was so good!!!!!  I also tried a bite of the cheese curd (mozzarella balls), but it was too salty for me.  

I brought my dogs with me to the drive thru and they offered dog treats for the both of them. Not only they got a joy ride,  they even got a taste of the treats.

Good customer service with good food.  I'll definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I like to go through the drive through on my way home, but honestly, every time I do that, it seems as if the staff gets the order wrong.  the sandwiches never had the correct toppings on them, so check before you leave.  Yesterday, I ordered the same thing I always order, and again, it was wrong.  I also tried to order soup from the list on the drive through menu and was told they don't have it--I don't know if it means they don't have soup anymore, or they were out of it, or the sign was wrong.  I'm generally a big fan of Culvers, but you should avoid this location.  The staff acts as if they're doing you a favor to give you anything, an generally it's wrong.  Go to Culvers on South Neil Street--they are better managed and accurate in filling orders."}
{"text":"Love me some Culver's!  The burgers rock, the cheese turds & onion rings are fab, and the fish fry is REALLY good!  And, let's not even talk about the malts!  OMG, sooooo gooooood!"}
{"text":"Got some drive thru. My girlfriends salad had a foot long hair in it. So I got up from my dinner and came back. Sure they made me a new salad but barely anything else was said. I even explained that I would like the whole ticket remade for my dinner was now ice cold but I'm was only given a apology and a small cup of ice cream. Very poor service. I come from mn and I'm very familiar with the Culver's brand. This was not it. I won't be back. Also they used the same bin of lettuce that the hair in the salad was from to make the new salad. Gross. I tossed the salad in the trash. Thanks for ruining my dinner"}
{"text":"Like Jack in the box, only 50x better!
The staff is very friendly, unbelievably diverse menu, and custom everything. 
Other fast food chains should take pointers from this one. I hope they expand to NC also."}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way to GA and will be coming back. Great food, clean restaurant and friendly people. And the frozen custard...?  Wow!!!  

Took a bite of my husband's bacon cheeseburger and stole some fries. Next time, I might have to pass on the salad since they were so good!  My salad was good, though. Freshly grated cheese, crisp croutons and a good assortment of greens. Probably wouldn't have the mango vinaigrette again but that's due to not liking sweet salad dressings. 

My son had the chicken tenders (stole some of those, too) and daughter had a grilled cheese. Both were very happy. 

You can order your dessert when you order the rest of your meal but ask them to bring it out after you've eaten. Keeps it from melting. Nice idea. 

This is a great alternative to typical fast-food off the highway but it's pretty pricey. Spent just under $40 for 4 of us. Worth the money, though!"}
{"text":"Yup I think I am going to say it. This burger place is as or just might be better than In and Out.  I just love the buttery bread they use and the meat is perfectly seasoned.  The ice cream, amazingly creamy. I am not much for burgers. I always prefer anything but burgers however every once in a while I crave them. I will be coming back to this place again. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Rude staff closed the door in my face at 9:59. I would have totally understood considering they close at 10. However the gentleman immediately in for of me was allowed in for some reason. 

Take my advice and go to the Culvers in chandler their staff is awesome."}
