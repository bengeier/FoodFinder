{"text":"I have to second the first review.  I live in Stoughton and can't believe the value at Laz's.  If you compare the quality of food and the prices to some of the higher end places in Wisconsin, you will be amazed.  It is certainly worth a short drive from Madison if you are wanting a great meal at a great price.  Laz Bistro's food can stand up to any restaurant around."}
{"text":"Laz Bistro is the best restaurant in Stoughton.  They have an ecclectic menu.  Our favorites are the ravioli, pulled pork, ribs, baked beans, and any of the soups.  One night they had a rissoto special that was great.   You might want to avoid the place on nights when there is a performance at the Opera House.  There were only two waitresses  and they needed roller skates to get every one to the show on time.  The prices are fair.  The room is casual and relaxing. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Would never go back without a coupon.    Actually, the service was good - not too rushed or too slow.  Unfortunately, that was the highlight....  The food was meh.  I think charging $15 for the salmon was way too much, considering it is just served with VERY bland white rice.  I would have been much happier if it came with a choice of 2 sides (even just the \"regular\" vs \"upgraded\" sides).   Personally, I'd love some veggies or a salad with my salmon, but am unwilling to \"add on\" when I'm already paying $15 for an entrée.  To me, it seems more reasonable to include something like that than just plain, white rice.  Hubby ordered the ribs and while they were good quality and didn't have a lot of grizzle or fat, they were a bit dry.  When he asked for some additional BBQ sauce, it was very runny and certainly was nothing special.  At least the ribs came with a choice of 1 \"regular\" and 1 \"upgraded\" side and he liked the asparagus and potatoes that came with his.    Maybe the issue is that this place has not yet decided who they want to be.  They have a curry dish, a Greek dish, ribs, salmon...  I liked the \"throw-back\" type of atmosphere with the long bar.  I had no issues with the décor."}
{"text":"Staff wasn't very friendly. Food wasn't very good. If you're visiting Stoughton, try our Weindigo or Big Sky instead."}
{"text":"Laz Bistro is a great dining option in Stoughton and the surrounding area. It has a somewhat quirky decor and menu that ranges from barbecue to Italian. The food is reasonably priced, but some of the portions are on the smaller side so you will want to get an appetizer. Get the kettle chips appetizer its delicious! All of the meals that our group had were excellent so you can't go wrong. Just be prepared for service that's on the slow side, but the waitresses are very nice and personable. All in all it was a good experience and I'll go back."}
{"text":"Not worth a second visit. The pulled pork was full of fat. Too many directions on the menu - should pick a style and stick with it. For the prices, you would expect some finer china and service. Nothing good about this place. Can't believe the good reviews."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for our anniversary and we couldn't have been happier. I got the special, and he ordered off the menu, and we both had the Pinot Noir. The server was extremely pleasant and she made wonderful suggestions. It wasn't the cheapest, but it was well worth it for the special occasion :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place. A destination. Incredible BBQ ribs. Service is wonderfully friendly and the atmosphere isn't stuffy at all considering the caliber of the food. They don't mind kids. Consistently exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"Perfectly nice little place for a pre show dinner- it was the place to go before Wendigo opened. Get an old-fashioned and the pulled pork or the spinakopita. The staff is kind and works hard to get you to the show on time."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook.    First, when you walk in you are smothered with amazing wallpaper.  I mean really, this wallpaper is great.  You will quickly fall in love with this place.  It feels like a diner, specially since there is a long bar that is bright like a diner's bar.  However, when you sit down and read them menu, you realize that you are in for a great meal, and wonderfully priced.    I had the pulled pork, which was outstanding.  Sometimes, it is one of the sides of which i write home about, and this time it was the baked beans.  Good lord i could have had a plate of them all to myself. The three of us ordered the beans, and i think we talked about them for like 7 minutes they were so good.  One of my friends had the rack of ribs, and based on the pile of clean ribs she left on her plate, it is safe to say they were great.    Don't go for the service, however.  My friends warned me that there would be no rush to our meals, that every time they go there the service is slow.  It didn't bother me, but it certainly was a bit slow.  Good company and a few drinks made the time fly by.  The staff is, however, extremely kind and very nice.  Our server apologized several times for the delay (they had also just gotten slammed as everyone showed up before the opening night of Annie down the street).  I feel bad we never told her that she had a pen mark on her cheek.    If you are ever wondering through Stoughton, make this your stop for dinner."}
{"text":"We were visiting Stoughton for a concert and I had found good reviews on Laz online. I really wanted to go there, but our concert went later than I expected and we didn't get there in time before closing. We made a special trip to Stoughton the next day, just so we could eat at Laz. We arrived and were greeted by a very nice server. We both decided we would get the pulled pork plate. I had cornbread and onion rings as sides and my partner had cornbread and fries (there was an up charge for fries? yep) My plate was $10 and as I looked down at that plate, I did not see $10. I had a very small portion of pulled pork, a piece of cornbread and seven onion rings. The pulled pork was swimming in grease and wasn't very tasty. I took one bite of the cornbread and that was all I needed of that. It was very dry and tasted like it had been baked the day or two before. The onion rings were just okay, typical frozen onion rings. My partner didn't care for his any more than I did. I did eat the onion rings because I was really hungry and I tried to eat some of the pork from the top that wasn't swimming in grease, but it just didn't taste very good, either. The next time the server came around, we just got a box and put our food in it and left. My dog enjoyed the food later, with no complaints."}
{"text":"Grouchy service, okay food.  NICE quiet atmosphere and great location if you are headed to Stoughton Opera House."}
{"text":"When visiting the Stoughton area, this restaurant is definitely worth a visit.  We stayed in a Bed & Breakfast in Stoughton and the proprietor suggested this as a good place to dine.  I would agree.  The food items on the menu vary, but they seem to specialize on good meet and especially BBQ.  I had a half portion of the pulled pork and it was just the right size for me to eat.  My dining companion had the half-rack of ribs and said they were outstanding.  Both of our dishes were well prepared and the price was very fair for what was provided, especially when considering the value.  The menu was broad and varied.  We talked with some other people who ate here the same night we did and they agreed that their food was well prepared and delicious.  We would recommend this place as a great dining place when in town and if you are driving along the interstate and would prefer a non-chain restaurant for lunch or dinner, this would be an outstanding selection.  You can enjoy walking around Stoughton, too, as it is a very nice little town.  Enjoy this little find in Southern Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Laz Bistro offers a fine-dining option that won't break your pocketbook or leave you disappointed with small portions.  I have not found a food there yet that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed, and they continue to provide excellent service and friendly care in your dining experience.  They even suggested my new favorite beer!  I had never heard of it before, and they offered it as a tasty option.  I LOVE IT!  They care about giving each patron a good experience--not pushing you to spend money.  And it isn't uncommon for the chef and owners to be found in the dining room enjoying the company of the locals they live and work with.  Definitely top on my charts!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't very good. It was obvious most of it was prepared by a food company and simply reheated.   I won't go back."}
{"text":"Oh my where do I begin? Every once in a while we get lucky and stumble upon a place we wish we knew about. My visit to Laz Bistro was one of those experiences.  Will begin with the food, after all that is why we go out to eat. I had the ribs while my dining partner had pulled pork. The ribs were smoked to perfection. They use a dry kc style rub, which leaves you to eat great food without messy fingers. I've had my share of ribs, these stood above the others by far. Then i moved on to the beans. What a wonderful combination of baked beans with a little bite married with the sweet flavor of apple. Then you when you think you've enjoyed the taste, you crunch a pecan. The side was the surprise of the night. This place is a bit cozy, and the waitress was kind enough to tell us the importance of reservations on show nights at the opera house. Since I already mentioned the waitress, let me tell you how outstanding she was. To her, it was obvious it wasn't a job, but a service she was providing and that she cared about the long term success of the restaurant.   How do I know this? When was the last time, at the conclusion of you meal, did your waitress bring a carry out menu, stress how all meals are prepared to order, how when we come back we should request food to be prepared how we want it, leaving or adding any ingredient we wish? They will make any dish vegetarian or gluten free if asked. I can not stress how much you need to visit. This is a dining experience you will not find elsewhere."}
{"text":"1st visit and surprised by the atmosphere and staff. Everyone was very polite, chef even came to table to ask how the food was. Wife had pulled pork, I enjoyed the meat tortolleni and both were very good, even had enough to take home for another meal. Will definitely be back. By the way they will even take reservations for only 2 people."}
{"text":"This place was highly touted to me. I went, and was seriously un-amazed. There  was nothing original or fresh. Its typical over-hyped overrated Stoughton food."}
{"text":"I live in Stoughton and have been to Laz's several times now.  In all of my prior experiences I would have gladly given them a solid 4-Star review, however I am happy to give 5-Stars based on my last visit.   I had some family in town and called around to some other places in town, all were full or seating an hour out.  I called Laz's and asked if they could accommodate a party of seven, and was told they could.  I wanted to discuss it with my family before deciding to stay local or drive to Madison, so I did not make a reservation.  We ended up driving over to Laz's a half hour later.  Walked in and the server says \"I set a table up for you just in case you decided to come\".  Fantastic, and it only got better!   Food there has always been terrific.  They have a very nice menu including some originals like the Cowboy Coffee Encrusted Steak, which I highly recommend.  All seven in my party agreed that every bite of every one of our meals was perfect.  The sides are as good as the main course, and I always get the special apple baked beans... this is the ONLY place that I have ever eaten baked beans (normally I can't stand them).   Service is stellar, bartender was great; even offering my uncle samples of a few of the draft beers they had so he could make a decision.  I had a margarita which they made fresh and was as good as I have had anywhere. Wine selection is nice, not over the top with fancy stuff, but a perfect collection for the \"average\" meal or special occasion.   Bottom Line: I truly believe this place is the best kept secret in Stoughton, and worth driving to if you're in surrounding areas."}
{"text":"My date and I visited Stoughton one day and were walking around the shops when we started craving some BBQ. We came upon Laz Bistro and decided to check it out because it said outside that they had BBQ, although it looked like an Italian joint. We showed up a little bit early, before dinner had begun, but the staff was nice enough to seat us and take our order anyway.  We were surprised by the interior to say the least! It was an Italian place, playing Italian music, but serving BBQ. It was pretty awesome. We ordered a few drinks and the house chips as an appetizer. They give you homemade vinegar sauce to put on the chips. I wasn't a huge fan of them, because the vinegar taste doesn't stick to the chips, but my date loved them. The only thing I disliked was the fact that I couldn't even finish my alcoholic beverage because it had far too much alcohol in it.  For our meals, we had some caesar salads, pulled pork, and ribs and it was all very delicious (although I wasn't a big fan of the baked beans with apples and pecans). The staff was very nice and we didn't have to badger them about anything. Needless to say, we've been wanting to go back for a while now!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the concept is at Laz. To put it simply, I found my dinner experience to be confused. There is odd wallpaper with an Italian theme while the menu contained everything from barbecue to nachos to egg rolls to  gyros. Nothing was necessarily bad, but as I said before, confused.  The atmosphere is just  as strange for a dining establishment which calls itself a bistro...there was nothing French or \"bistro-y\" about it.  I hate to give a negative review to a local eatery here in Stoughton, as small business is what keeps Stoughton so vibrant! Laz Bistro however doesn't seem to contribute much to the food scene here, in my opinion. A new concept and smaller menu, coupled with some updates to the interior could do wonders for Laz."}
{"text":"Good service, good prices, killer BBQ ribs.  My wife had salmon, and that was good too."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in one night for girls night.  They went out if their way to accommodate her request for something not on the menu.  Keep in mind she's 3.  The staff was wonderful and it was nice to see that they genuinely seemed to care about us having a good experience.   The food was good. . I had salmon that was delicious but slightly over cooked hence the 4 stars. .  I will absolutely come back for more special girls night with the little miss."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and a nice cozy atmosphere...but probably the worst ribs I've ever had in my life. Maybe other food is better? Best of luck.."}
{"text":"My husband and i went to Laz for a date night, and were very impressed!  We started with the egg rolls and they were delicious!  I had the coffee crusted steak and my husband had the pulled pork - both were amazing!  Service was great - be prepared to take your time and enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"Went back here again.  The mussels with Thai curry for appetizer had a great sauce but the mussels felt a little gritty like they weren't very fresh.  However, the Thai Curry Chicken Stew was solid.  The desserts here are very good.  Also the sangria that the owner made was tasty as well."}
