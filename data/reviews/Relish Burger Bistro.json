{"text":"Sometimes you just want a good burger and fantastic service.  Is that so much to ask?!  Burger a little pricey, but so perfectly cooked.  The service was so friendly, attentive and helpful.  It was my first time in the tempe/pheonix/scottsdale area and my server Jasmine was incredibly helpful in giving me ideas on what to do.  Brian the manager was fantastic in making sure we were well taken care of and everything was spot on.    And their happy hour is fantastic!  Home run, and great first meal in AZ."}
{"text":"All I can say is, Relish is Delish! Great service! Completely reasonable prices. Great fried pickles! (Just saying.) We're staying at The Phoenician, and wanted to try Relish, but burnt from a day in the sun. So, we got our food to go, and we figured we'd have to wait 20-30 min to get our food, when in actuality it took 10! Fresh and delightful! Great location, easy access, and cool environment. Good choice overall!"}
{"text":"My burger was so big and delicious! The french fries were also awesome!"}
{"text":"What may look like a golf course restaurant is actually an amazing place for anyone to go for lunch, golfing or not! Relish Burger's offers a variety of favorites like Soda's, Floats, Burgers, and Appetizers, but in that upscale way the Phoenician does best. For out-of-towner's who want to try something fun while they are on vacation, try the Prickely Pear soda!"}
{"text":"So we went to this place because Yelp reviewers said that it was really good! I have to say good choice fellow Yelp reviewers!!  This was a very nice, clean restaurant. The staff who worked here were all very friendly and very helpful! They were attentive without being annoying!  I ordered the Mushroom Cheeseburger and it was amazing!! Loved it!! Would go again for sure! Yes it might be a $16 burger, but it is a big burger and you choose to have a rare burger, which most places won't do anymore! It was incredible! I loved it.  I also loved the tots!! Very incredible!!  I really don't remember the margarita that they served me, but it too was very good. I highly recomend this place!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best burgers in town! I wanted to lick my plate clean. Tater tots and onion rings are cooked to perfection.  Ask for Andrew. He is knowledgeable, friendly, tells great stories and makes a great drink!"}
{"text":"Even though the night I went to Relish it was 108 degrees of miserableness, I still mustered up an appetite for some fried pickles! Yes, I said it, fired pickles.  Now I would be lying if I said what came out of the kitchen was what I had fantasized about prior to my visit.  I pictured some big, stiff, juicy fried master piece.  What was placed in front of me was somewhat disappointing.  It was a quarter of my vision and whats worse is it was soggy.  If I'm going to eat something fried, especially a pickle no less, I want crunch dammit! But I still give Relish 3 stars based on the burgers (I had the veggie, very tasty!) and the service.  Everyone else at the table seemed overall pleased as well.  The black and bleu burger looked good, maybe next time, I'll skip the pickles and go for the beef!  One more tip before you go, check their hours.  The waitress said they were somewhat funky."}
{"text":"This place needs to get their $&@! together... So many employees and they all ignore you, never came back for refills, took almost an hour for a salad. Honestly, it really wasn't that busy. No one came to check or ask NOT ONCE. Horrible customer service and I wish I could tell you how the food was."}
{"text":"Love.  Love.  Love!  Great burgers, great environment, great service.  This is an absolute must try."}
{"text":"If you are a Bloody Mary fan, this place has to be on your bucket list.  They have a totally over the top and completely awesome bloody called the Packed 10 (I think).  It is named for the 10 \"toppings\" which include a Kobe beef slider and a perfect piece of bacon among other great additions.  Food was great and service was good but the bloody mary made the meal!"}
{"text":"I stopped in at the last minute for a light lunch. The server said I could sit wherever I liked. the place was about 1/3 full. I selected a small table in the lounge area and was immediately greeted with a menu and offer to get a drink. I barely had time to open up my scrabble app on my phone before my server was back with a tall cold glass of black tea in a confetti -carnival type of glassware.  Looking at the menu I saw all types of Gourmet Burgers with names indicating the toppings. I actually was drawn to the Chicken Caprese Sandwich. It looked and sounded perfect since I wanted something lighter and it came with delicious sweet potato fries! After I ordered it, my server asked if I wanted it \"knife & fork\" style. Huh? basically the same thing but with out the bun and the chicken on top of the tomato, mozzarella and greens. She also suggested I get the basil pesto dressing on the side. How considerate! She was reading my mind.  After a few scrabble words with my unknown random competitor, my lunch arrived. The portion of chick atop the caprese salad seemed like a lot at first with it's perfect grill marks. The salad underneath was fresh and perfectly shrouded the thick round chunk of mozzarella protecting a large wheel tomato. The dressing on the side was powerful and was a perfect little dip now and then. Even my Sweet potato fries which were piled recklessly in a miniature grocery basket at the top of the plate tasted great dipped in the basil pesto dressing.   I was good and did not consume all of the fries, but the salad and chicken were history in just a short time. No scrabble could interrupt this delicious and healthy lunch. My iced tea was refilled in a timely manner and I was in and out of there within 40 quick minutes.   I can't wait to go back and experience the scallops, flat iron steak, bbq ribs or one of those amazing burgers!"}
{"text":"Arrived at the Phoenician after a long day of travelling. My guy ordered  a burger and I asked for one of the large salads. Wait staff seemed disinterested in us, I asked for salad dressing on the side, my 16$ salad arrived already dressed, and when I asked about it, I was told that was how it came but I could get more dressing if I wanted. Nope, not what I wanted. I was hungry, so I ate the tasteless plate of soggy lettuce. Burger was good. No one ever checked back on us until we were finished. Needless to say, we will not return."}
{"text":"Overlooking the Phoenician golf course, this sports bar is a gourmet experience complete with top tier food, service and drinks.   I enjoyed the cowboy burger, tasty taters and a chopped blue cheese wedge.  This spot was so good I ventured back 3x during my stay at the resort."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and the food. They fireplace was warm and inviting and the server was friendly and very attentive! We ordered Kobe sliders, sweet potato fries and the cornbread skillet for appetizers. Tried the Cowboy burger (minus the bacon) and Tater tots for dinner. And of course had to try the warm chocolate  chip  cookie for dessert. Everything  was excellent!"}
{"text":"The kids love their Kobe beef sliders and shakes. The view overlooks the golf course. Nice staff :)"}
{"text":"Not bad. The group that went all had hamburgers. Tater tots are a nice touch. Two negatives that lowered my rating. Place is almost impossible to find. We parked under the main hotel property only to learn after asking multiple staff members that the bistro was at the other end of the property  - at the golf club house. A 15 minute circuitous walk. Finally get there, it is around 1pm on a Sunday, place is maybe half full. A nice warm Phoenix early summer day ... 100 degrees. We all ordered iced tea and about 10 minutes later we were brought water because they were out of iced tea. Really!!!! Anyway, they indicated they were making more and would bring it out when it was ready. Another 10 minutes go by, we decided to inquire on the status of the iced tea - we got a \"let me check\". Three people opted for root beer just to get something besides water to drink. I opted to wait for the iced that I wanted and had ordered.  In all of my reviews, I point out that it is always the small stuff that eats away at a great review. The small things always impact the experience and when there are multiple small things, they add up and detract from what would otherwise have been a great experience. May try again - but will go in with higher expectations. Hope they are up to delivering a better experience."}
{"text":"The section of tequila, advertised as one of the most extensive in the country, was amazing.  Unfortunately I unable to take advantage of it at lunch.  I did have a salmon burger and maple bacon tater tots though.  The salmon burger was crispy and had good accoutrements.  The maple bacon tater-tots (regular tots tossed in maple syrup then garnished with bacon bits) were tasty but eating the whole side was not possible.  I'd recommend going when you can taste tequilas and share the tots!"}
{"text":"Tip: Once you drive up the road into the golf course, park on the first parking lot on the right, there's no parking past Relish.   My favorite part are the amazing view of the golf course as you walk to the restaurant and look out the window. The interior is clean and has many TVs for all sports fans. However I would subtract 1 star because of the mediocre quality of the food and the price. I expected it to be overpriced of course because it's inside a golf course but I expected better quality of food at least. One burger is $16! The bun was dry and the patty was good but not worth $16. I've had unami burger in LA for that price and it was 10x better than here. I didn't think the burger was juicy enough and lacked enough flavor.   I did like the pork sliders, full of flavor and sauce. If you do come, highly recommend those over the burger! And the waitress was not friendly enough to default charge me gratuity for my party. Barely saw a smile on her face the whole meal."}
{"text":"Great place.. friendly waitresses. The food was amazing...TOO much food... but it is amazing.. I did the chicken caprese, knife and fork style, which helped with all the food served.. it was good. BBQ chicken nachos, outstanding, fried pickles, different and taste,  and we had chicken wings hubby said they were awesome.. We were there with a big party.. hence all the food that was supplied."}
{"text":"We were a bit disappointed by Relish.  I'll overlook the fact that it looks like a gentleman's club from the 60s and has never been updated. And I'll try to forgive the ridiculously slow service where there were maybe 5 tables and just one waitress who serviced only one table at a time. Or the fact that we had to ask for drink refills... repeatedly...  No, it was the lukewarm, overcooked burger with disappointing toppings that really did us in. I had cold, flavorless bacon. Non existent cheese. My husband raved about the mushrooms on his burger but stated they must've forgotten to season the meat. It really was disappointing for a place that specializes in burgers.  We capped off the meal with an adult milkshake. Yes, incredibly overpriced, but sooooooooooo good. Made me almost forget the crappy burger. *Almost*."}
{"text":"4/5 solid stars  This is a great burger joint with good beer if you don't want to leave the huge Phoenician property. However, be prepared to pay some good $$$ for convenience!   We arrived on a Monday night and the restaurant was barely packed.  Ordered: 1) Chili Soup: 4/5 amazing presentation and the taste was wonderful too.  2) Turkey Burger with DELICIOUS tater tots! 4/5 yumm!"}
{"text":"Huge burgers! Excellent service and the best sweet potato waffle fries :). Get a table overlooking the golf course. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The kids love the bento boxes.  I thought the tortilla soup was great. Others had sliders and said they were tasty."}
{"text":"I told the waiter I was going to the restroom and came back to a committee at my table, they took away my lunch and drink. Very expensive, bad service."}
{"text":"A great, non-pretentious, casual dining experience at the Phoenician.  Loved the gourmet burger menu but even better where the off-season specials.  One of the best resort values I've seen in a long time.  Service - A+  (extremely courteous and prompt attention) Burgers - $18-$19 But this evening's specials: Craft Beers - $4 (try multiple local draft beers) Burger & Dessert - $20 combo special.   I ordered the Cobb burger, which had generous strips of thick cut bacon, maytag blue cheese and lettuce/tomato. Burger was cooked perfectly (medium) and the tatter tots were hot & crispy.  Only drawback was the potato bun (i think) was a little greasy but flavors very good.  My wife had the Blue Burger and and very similar to the Cobb burger.  Can't go wrong with either.   The only minor disappointment where the chicken nachos, which were hefty portions served in a piping hot skillet but the bbq sauce tasted store bought.  Would have liked less bbq sauce and more mexican flavor.   For dessert we had the apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream & caramel sauce. So much food I couldn't finish but a great end to a very nice dinner.   While not on the special menu, the table next to us ordered the Flaming Smores and what a cool presentation - which a live fire pot brought right to your table to roast your marshmallows. One of those wow deserts.   A nice combination of up-scale dining and evening specials."}
{"text":"Beautiful place right on the golf course. Their burgers are amazing, they are Kobe beef.  The Bloody Mary was good but not spicy enough."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Happy Hours in Scottsdale. From 3:30-6 PM every single day, you get about 50% off Relish's amazing food and drinks.  Not only that, but there are great views of the beautiful golf course, and fantastic/fast service.  Some of the Happy Hour menu highlights that we enjoyed: -Unbelievable Sliders for only $3 each.   -Delicious Tacos: 3 for $6. -Pretzel Bread with Cheese Fondue for $5, with a refill on the bread for only $1.  Honestly I'm not sure I would come here for an ordinary meal, as most of their entrees and drinks are pretty pricey, but for Happy Hour - this is a spot you have to try.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Want to make sure you catch up on football while you are at the Phoenician resort? This is the place to be. Make sure you stop in and grab a bite during your stay."}
{"text":"The burger was good of course but for me it was all about those tater tots. So crisp. So good! I want to go back for tequila tastings - a huge variety of tequila."}
{"text":"As a burger lover, I was super excited to give this place a try!  And while it has a casual vibe, the decor was not so casual. Started off with the bbq chicken nachos which would have been better with half the amount of cheese. Ended up sticking with the classic burger and added cheddar and roasted green chile. I was surprised that it was literally a whole roasted chile flattened out on the burger which made it a little difficult to eat, but still tasty!  The burger was seasoned perfectly and I loved the brioche bun. My favorite burger place is still Zinburger, but Relish Burger is definitely a strong contender.  Oh and the  grilled strawberry mojiito is a must try!"}
{"text":"There are few things in life I relish more than golf courses, bar food, and alcohol.  If you find yourself similarly-inclined, then you too will relish Relish.    Understand, of course, that this isn't your average bar food, or your average drinks.  Relish's burgers are among the most inventive, skillfully-crafted, and delicious \"bar\" burgers I've ever tasted.  And while they run on the pricier side, they are also enormous -- easily big enough for two people to share.  That's especially true when you consider the accompanying relish you receive, namely in the way of perfectly fried tater tots, served in their fry basket.  The drink menu is extensive -- Relish nails all of the basics, while putting their own relish on others.    A word on the BBQ chicken nachos, as they merit their own paragraph.  These nachos are among the best nachos Noah X., a veritable chonnoisseur if there ever was one, has ever had.  The meat-to-chip ratio is proper, as is the sturdiness of the chips themselves.  These chips are the ideal vessels through which to carry the cornucopia of flavors present in a skillet overflowing with the finest relish at Relish.  Could this restaurant be more aptly named?  I can't even embellish.  I'm in love with Relish."}
{"text":"I visited Relish as part of my Best Burgers of Phoenix challenge. It came in third place out of 16 restaurants, and is really good. Here's the review.  There are some burgers that focus on the best possible meat. There are others that focus on having a great bun, or interesting ingredients. Some places, like Relish, seem to understand how important balance is, and really push to make sure it's a perfect bite. The burger recommended to me was the Cowboy. The \"kobe\" meat was a nice, juicy medium-rare, and when combined with the crunchy large onion rings, melted cheddar and salty bacon, the first bite was a hit.  The lingering peppery jalapenos didn't have much kick, but instead were more like a refreshing pickle. The burger was already good at this point, but adding the homemade tangy steak sauce really sold me. Great bun, high quality meat, tasty toppings and attention to balance of flavor. Top marks for The Cowboy.  To check out the other burgers in the review and photos, visit http://forkvsfood.com/best-burger-review/"}
{"text":"5 star service & food!!  First of all, the girls behind the bar were super friendly and helpful.  They were patient and kind as we took forever to make up our minds.    The burger I had was truly one of the BEST I have ever had.  The kobe beef was seasoned to perfection and the whole thing came together perfectly.    We followed dinner with the s'mores dessert and it so much fun!!!  5 stars for the dessert \"experience\" alone.  They bring out your own personal little fire pit with hot coals and everything you need to make a s'more.  It's like having your own personal little campfire right there at the table.  WE LOVED IT!!!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't belong at a resort. Ignore the fact that it's at a resort, nevermind a golf club, because this places dishes up an amazing cheeseburger slash burger of any type --- salmon, turkey, bison...take your pick! Plus you get tots....crispy, salty, yummy tots. A nice change from the standard fry. The burger is huge & when you add in the tots it's a big meal - I could only finish half! Wash the burger down with one of the many beers they offer, or event a spiked malt. Now that is 5-star resort livin'.."}
{"text":"Tater Tots For The Win!   Think what you like, but I take my tater tots seriously.  Often, they are trivialized as a children's food or some hipsterish food fad. Well, F that! I'm loving this resurgence and I hope they are here to stay.    With that being said, Relish Burger Bistro takes their tater tots seriously.  They are perfectly browned, crispy, tasty without mush or grease.  The salt ratio was spot on.  Sorry to pull out the asshole foodie term, but they have the perfect mouthfeel.  (sorry not sorry, but I had to, there is no other way to describe how amazing these freekin' tater tots were.)  Honestly, its been a couple of weeks, and I'm still thinking about how good they were.    My tots were served alongside an ahi tuna burger, which is the reason this review is knocked down from a perfect rating.  The sandwich was good, but not fantastic by any means.  Instead of a cohesive piece of tuna, the tuna was served in strips on the bun with an Asian slaw.  Slaw was good though, but I wasn't happy about how it actually looked.  It looked discombobulated and thrown together...the whole bun/meat ratio was all off and it kind of bothered my inner nutcase self.  Taste was pretty good but I found myself wishing that I went for a regular burger instead of a seafood alternative.  And the sad thing was that I decided to go for fish because I've had been trying to cut down on my red meat recently.  Lesson learned.  I also ordered a house-made soda, which was delicious but a tad too sweet.    I ate here with a bunch of co-workers and each one of us really enjoyed our burgers.  Service was spot on as well; our server was very accommodating and easy going.  At one point she was bit hard to find but its because she got slammed with tables; but its easily forgiven.  And she was even gracious when we asked for separate bills because we were all expensing our lunches.  Overall, a great lunch and I would definitely revisit if I was to stay at the Phoenician again."}
{"text":"There are few places that hit the mark when it comes to great food, great service, and a great atmosphere... but RELISH has managed to do just that!  Whether we are in the Valley staying at the Phoenician or staying with friends/family... my husband and I always make it a point to bring our family of 6 in to Relish for dinner.  The roomy/comfortable seating has nice views of the golf course.  There are a handful of flat screen TVs playing sports... in the dining room and the bar.  And the food is consistently melt in your mouth DELICIOUS!!!  Burgers are always cooked to our requested temperature, the BBQ nachos are amazing, the crispy tater tots are a family favorite, and the beer and wine selection keeps my husband and I very happy.  The kids menu is also outstanding!!!  The younger patrons will enjoy their bento box style meal with lots of entree options, even gluten free.  To top it off, the service has been EXCEPTIONAL!  We will always ask for CAMERON, who has on more than one occasion provided us with service that is friendly, knowledgeable, professional, timely, and sincere!  Already looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"I'm going to say 3 stars as an average. Here's why:  4 - the view and the property. The exterior of this golf club is beautiful and well kept. My dad and my brother were almost drooling as they looked upon the course. The decor, fountains, staircases are all just very swanky swank and comfortable. I did enjoy that aspect of Relish.  3.5 - We were really looking forward to eating kobe beef burgers since we had a good experience with another restaurant at the resort (Il Terrazzo.) I think we were hoping for a similar burger. The burgers were pretty decent -- they had a lot more components than the other one we tried. (That one was a fairly standard burger, so the flavor of the beef seemed to be more of the centerpiece.)   I had the True Bleu, which had a strong bleu cheese flavor -- pretty tasty. Others enjoyed their burgers. They were all huge and they were just stacked.  I had the sweet potato fries, which were tastier and much less salty than the tater tots. I had one tater tot and couldn't eat any more.  2 - Service was slow. I really liked our waitress. She was sweet, and we treated her well. Unfortunately, the servers seemed unattentive to their guests, and that definitely affected my experience there.   It's a nice place to go after a round of golf for sure!"}
{"text":"I am visiting Scottsdale from Seattle and was looking for the best burger for Father's Day.  We found it!!  5 different ready made burgers or design your own by adding condiments from an impressive list of choices.  The view of the golf course is also nice as the grounds of the Phoenician are quite beautiful."}
{"text":"The Big Bertha was her name and I took Big Bertha down 1lb of Kobe beef with american cheese topped with special chopped salad.  Let me break down what I sampled at this great establishment.  I only had to order one thing, looked at the menu and even before getting to the end of it I already knew what I was going to order.  The tater tots - heavenly made, all had crunch, slight kick to each one like they added chili powder or something hot to give em an extra wow factor  the big bertha - they boasted can't be done, HA sounded like a challenge to me, burger stood tall with two patties equalling 1lb and hella veggies to ruin any carnivores palette. bun was decent by the time you get to the bottom, the bun is so saturated with beef juices it can be eaten with a spoon, honestly there was to much salad on this burger, only looked intimidating at first glance, but after getting through the first layer it was a piece of cake, again by the time you hit the bottom of the burger you will have thrown out all the extra salad parts added as well as the bun. On a whole burger was good, tender, juicy made medium well, slightly salted and sauced with multiple sauces unless of course that was all the juices of  that dripped down from the burger. I definitely will be back to try anything else they offer.  had a tall alcoholic beverage \"Hef\" standard, served ice cold in a tall glass that was also ice cold.  good spot for lunch if you like to be in a coma for the rest of the day  food **** one of the better burgers I had while in Arizona price $$ 32dollars for the big bertha notice I put it in small caps cause it was not that big haha service ***** on the ball, never had to ask for a refill, courteous and friendly staff ambiance ***** enjoy the outdoors during some blazing heat, was about comfortable 80 degrees slight wind blowing perfect weather to be outside under some shade."}
{"text":"While this place is a little on the expensive side for \"sports bar food,\" the quality and creativity of the offerings make up for it! While I was staying at the Phoenician for vacation, I visited Relish on one of my last days, but I'm so glad I did. The casual atmosphere combined with amazing views of the golf courses made for a very relaxing dining experience.   While the service could have been faster, I appreciate that I was able to order half of my food to go, along with my iced tea. I tried the tuna sandwich that arrived with many interesting and delicious ingredients, not to mention the yummy but dangerous tater tots! Luckily, I had just hiked Camelback Mountain beforehand so I didn't feel quite as guilty. Like I mentioned in my tip, if given the opportunity, sitting outside is preferable because the views are gorgeous and there are heat lamps available for extra warmth!"}
{"text":"Good lunch burger deal ($20 for any burger plus dessert!)  Really liked the grilled chicken salad with pistachio dressing. The pozole soup is very robust and filling."}
{"text":"This was our final restaurant destination for Fall Restaurant Week. So glad we chose this place!  Start with a pint of Kiltlifter (always a good place to start!) Step-dad and I ordered identically down the option list.  Habanero duck tacos - Delish! Torta burger - OMG, they need to add this to the menu! At any price! It had EVERYTHING on it - and was all top quality and delicious! It was far too big, though. I ate my way through as much of it as I could, but still left plenty of goodies and both halves of the challah bun on the table. I only ate a third of my tots! (And they were really good tots!) Dessert was super decadent with chocolate cake and a salted caramel ice cream - I took most of the cake home for the next day.  Lovely patio, impressive tequila selection, attentive service and not as 'stuck up' as I expected it to be, as it's in the Phoenician.  There's also an impressive daily happy hour - which I will definitely be back for!"}
{"text":"If you are a burger connoisseur and looking for a great atmosphere this is a must do!  Right next to old town Scottsdale which has burger restaurants  everywhere you look.  But if you are looking for a relaxing, resort type atmosphere, look no further.  Yes, you will spend more than your average burger place around town but you also will not have to deal with the 20 something ridiculousness that happens in old town.  Making this one of my favorite places to get a burger especially if you just finished a round of golf at the Phoenician.  If you have young ones they will enjoy this meal as well.  The desserts here are absolutely awesome (I'm talking mainly about the open fire s'mores and shakes!  Yum.)  Honestly, this is a 4.5 star rating for me just because of the price.  But when you want to feel like your on vacation then do it!"}
{"text":"We live next to the Phoenician, so this is a restaurant we like to visit frequently. Took the family over for a nice relaxing lunch today, and were rewarded with absolutely fantastic food! Unfortunately, as is often the case with this restaurant, the service was subpar at best... The server was not rude, she simply was not friendly or knowledgeable, and didn't seem to care at all about our experience. It's a shame, is this place could be great!"}
{"text":"Love the veggie burger and sweet potato waffle fries! My husband and I often go to the spa at The Phoenician and then walk across the street to Relish for lunch. Excellent service and friendly and accommodating staff keep us coming back!"}
{"text":"I feel bad giving this 2 stars but I'm basing it on other burger joints in the area. I recently Had a fab experience at Zinburger so this is why they are only getting 2 stars. Sat at the bar and ordered the cowboy Burger and adult choc milkshake ($14) pretty pricey and tasted just like a reg choc shake?? The burger bun on the bottom was extremely mushy and was not eaten. Overall I just have had better. All the burgers are $16, luckily we said \"happy birthday\" which is a deal thru today May 4th 3-6 PM that makes one burger free. Prob wont go back."}
{"text":"Good place, but overpriced!  A coworker and I enjoyed burgers and tots for $16 each...at least it was really good!  The atmosphere needs work...they haven't done anything to it since it was the old restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are a sports lover, they have multiple TVs with various games on. We tried the chicken posole, chicken spinach salad with pistachio dressing, the cowboy burger, and a strawberry milkshake.   The strawberry milkshake was very runny and not your typical thick and creamy drink. The burger was the best item with some luscious crispy bacon that was picture perfect. For the grilled chicken in the salad, I was a bit disappointed, it tasted like it was pre-grilled and refrigerated for hours. The pistachio dressing was quite unique and a nice touch though. I love posole soup and was interested to try this take of it. I didn't love it but at least it was not overly salty. They provide a cup of chili sauce for you to spice it up to your liking.   Service was lacking. I was parched and drank my water early on in the meal. I asked for a refill which did not happened until we finished eating."}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour!  Every day from 3:30-6 pm, you get free chips & salsa, discounted brewskis, and great food specials.  We got the Kobe beef sliders at $3 a pop, and the BBQ chicken quesadilla for $5.  The food was pretty good, and the happy hour prices made it worthwhile.  Maybe I'm cheap but at full price I would feel ripped off eating here.  If you are staying at the Phoenician and looking for a spot for a casual meal, this is absolutely your best bet."}
{"text":"Took my family this week and we had a great time! The food was great and portion sizes were huge. The service was also exceptional and they always came by making sure drinks were topped off and seeing if we needed anything. Highly recommend this place for families or for an easy night out. Afterwards make sure to walk across by pool area and sit in one of the hang out spots and have a cocktail"}
{"text":"Some friends are having their wedding at the Phoenician.  They are thinking about having one of their \"wedding weekend\" festivities at Relish so my wife and I joined them there for dinner to try it out.  The inside/outside of the place probably hasn't changed much since it was a simple \"19th hole\" bar and grill for a decade.  I think they just changed the name to something trendy and updated the menu a bit to appeal to the young/hip folk.  Anyway, the weather was perfect so we sat outside to enjoy the view.  It is just a small balcony with 5-6 tables and not much decor to speak of.  It was nice though.  I wasn't expecting it, but this place has about a zillion tequilas as you will see when you first enter the place.  So if that is your thing they definitely have something for you.  Another thing they had which I thought was quite unique was a tequila flight.  You choose a few of them and they give you a shot pour of each.  I ordered a 3 tequila flight and it came in a pretty cool tasting tray thingy which was neat.  Each one was very good and it was a great experience overall.  Tequila isn't totally my thing but I love to drink and learn about new stuff so I had to try it.  Our waitress and the manager  were like tequila sommeliers and knew about every one of their tequilas on the menu and provided great recommendations.  The food:  * Wedge Salad - this was just ok.  It was just your standard wedge.  Nothing special.  Just eh.  I love love love wedges but not this one.  I think it needed more dressing or something.  I would try another salad next time.  * Mushroom Cheese Burger - Excellent!  It was juicy and delicious.  The Kobe was perfectly tender and not overly salty as it sometimes is.  * Tater tots = Sooo good.  Enough said.  * Adult Milkshakes = Very good and very unique.  The manager guy took his time and crafted a very attractive sampler with 3 milkshakes on it for each of us.  I was especially a fan of the Reese's one but it was very very rich.  The best part about this place was the service.  Our waitress, Jasmine and the manager (looks like Ryan Phillippe but I didn't get his name) were both excellent and made our dining experience excellent.  Maybe it was because our friends are getting married there, but I like to think that they are awesome to everyone.  Anyway, I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"I have come to expect poor service and mediocre food from hotel restaurants. This place was no exception. The waitress told me the Ruben was great and had lots of meat on it. FALSE. It only has about 5 pieces of meat and very little taste. I tried a bite of my wife's burger. It was good but not great. I don't think I would spend $20 on another burger here."}
{"text":"This was our second trip to the RBB. The food is always excellent, pricey though. Our server was great too. He was super friendly and attentive. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Relish Burger Bistro is located in the impressive Phoenician Resort by the golf course. The parking is close and easy.  The menu does focus on a variety of gourmet burgers from vegetarian, fish, chicken, ribs and mostly 8 oz kobe style beef on house made buns. The average burger at the time of this review runs about $17.00. They also offer a large tequila bar and do make adult booze enhanced milk shakes to go with your burgers.   On my last visit we had absolutely delicious but over cooked burgers. Although the both burger were cooked medium well instead of the medium and medium rare we requested the burgers still had a delicious burger flavor and still were juicy. We also had not so great service so I thought it was a a fluke and my next visit would differ for the better.  I thought I'd be adding a star or two to my updated review.  My visit did differ.  We were greeted promptly and soon were seated. I didn't notice at the time but the menu has changed slightly and the burgers cost slightly more than last time. Since I had a kobe style burger last time I thought I'd try a salmon burger this time ordering knife and fork style so I'd lose the bun and gain a tasty salad and get sweet potato waffle fries instead of tater tots.  Our platters arrive. There is no mention on the menu of crispy fried noodles for my platter and I thought they were very odd on top of a burger so I brushed them aside. I dug into the salmon burger and it had a really nice soy ginger crust but the inside was very salty with other flavors that over powered the salmon. I read that they serve high quality North Atlantic Salmon but with the way they seasoned and prepared the salmon tasted and also had a texture like grocery store low quality salmon. I missed that wonderful buttery texture and sweet flavor that very good salmon has. The salads were good. The sweet potato waffle fried were prepared better than last time. The wasabi mayo helped to mask the flavors in the burger.   My husband thought he ordered the delicious burger he had last time but it turned out to be a different burger with different flavors. This burger was cooked close to the medium rare he ask for but it lacked the juice and burger flavor the patty should have had so he was disappointed because you get all excited when you splurge for a $18.00 dollar burger and really think your going to get that perfect burger.  I don't know if the burgers get prepared different or they just had a new cook that maybe gave the burger a squish while cooking that might have released the juices. I do know that kobe style beef can be tricky to cook and only comes out well in a pan.  We were checked on and we told the waitress that everything was ok because overall everything was ok just not great like we were hoping for.  I had a Scottsdale preferred card and used to to get one meal free.  We got the bill and it only took out $9.00 so my husband brought that up with the server and a correction was made.  Great potential for that really awesome dream burger.  Maybe you will hit them when they do it."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because the overall property was so nice.  Good Food, Good Service, Good View (overlooking the golf course).  I had the Chicken Caprese sandwich which was quite tasty, but the burger my mom has was WAY better.  If you go here.... order a burger.  They are big, juicy and super duper good.  It's also super duper messy.  It's a \"fork and knife\" type of burger.   Their bloody mary is pretty good... a little too tomato-y.... needed more seasoning.  Mom's John Daly Peach drink was refreshing.  Good for cooling off and relaxing after a round of golf.  :)  Tater Tots were served with our sandwiches and they were good... but nothing all that special.  They were crunchy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside... but for this type of establishment.... I would have expectetd Truffle Tots or something different.  Their relishes that they offered on the side were 'ok'..... I was not impressed.  They tasted like they were from a bottle.... I'm sure they make their own relish... I'm just saying they didn't taste any different than the ones you get at the store."}
{"text":"I like that I can get a burger here that is as every bit as good as the best spots in the area while also enjoying the great resort atmosphere cultivated at the Phoenician."}
{"text":"We only went here because we got a gift card. I wouldn't spend my own hard-earned money on this place.   The food is overpriced. Spending $16 on an unimpressive burger is ridiculous. My husband got the Big Bertha for $32. Crazy, I know. The garlic fries were overcooked, and the deep fried pickles had too much breading. I would rather go to Delux, where I can get a delicious burger and fries for less.   The service was AWFUL! Our waitress basically ignored us the entire night. She spent all her time chatting with the bartender, and it was a struggle to get her attention.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Two words: happy hour. It's every day from 3-6 PM and they have some amazing deals! You can get one of their delicious burger sliders for just $3 a slider. You can order their BBQ Chicken Nachos for about $6. Everything is very inexpensive during happy hour and everything is simply sublime! The menu here is pricey when it's not happy hour though, so be prepared to spend $16 on a burger if you miss happy hour!   I like the atmosphere at Relish because it has a \"man room\" feel to it. The furniture is dark and comfortable, the windows overlook the beautiful Phoenician golf course and they have several flat screen TVs and a fire place. It's a great place to sit and relax.   Now let's talk more depth about the food. I wish I could eat a million of their burgers! I don't know what they do to them but the burgers are extremely juicy, with this flavorful special sauce and placed on a soft bun. My second favorite dish would be the BBQ Chicken Nachos. The happy hour portion is smaller but still provides a decent amount of food! The BBQ sauce and chicken compliments the cheesy nachos and makes for a hearty dish!"}
{"text":"Relish Burger Bistro was absolutely fantastic! My family and I ate here twice in one trip. Both times were equally as great.   The food was delicious. The burgers were very juicy and good. The burger comes with either Tater tots or on a bed of sweet potato fries. I tried the tater tots and they were TO DIE FOR. They were crispy and fresh and delicious. I ended the meal with the Cookie Skillet, which has pecans and was delicious. I also drank a Creamsicle smoothie, which is pretty much an vanilla milkshake with orange juice, which tastes delicious and thick. One unique thing about Relish Burger Bistro is they have S'mores for dessert, where you can roast your own S'mores over a charcoal fire.  I would recommend going during Happy Hour because they have a lot of food deals and many drinks are on sale.  The service was great. Kyle, our waitress both times, was fun, entertaining, and friendly.   Overall, the food and service is really good. Recommend getting tater tots, cookie sundae, s'mores, and the Creamsicle Milkshake."}
{"text":"Very good burgers... yummy tortilla soup and great service.   Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch on a Sunday. I got a lovely outside table with a beautiful view of the golf course. They have a wide selection of beers including some very eclectic brands.   I ordered the BBQ pork sliders and the chile verde, both listed as appetizers. Both were excellent. The chile verde had a lovely flavor without needing any fixin'! A balance of sweet, hot, sour, and salty. The BBQ pork sliders were on the sweeter side with a lovely slaw providing tartness and crunch. Just too much to eat for me, as always!"}
{"text":"Good burgers! They look just like the pictures. Get the make your own s'mores, very fun! We got the season queso chorizo burger...omg so good. My dad got the southwest Cobb burger, and it was just okay."}
{"text":"Given how horrible my experience was at CJ's, I try to avoid the Phoenician restaurants, but did have a burger here a few week ago and found to be pleasant. Food: 3 Service: 2 Parking: 4 Atmosphere: 5 Value: 3  generally, reasonable place. Had their burger and like the presentation and setup. For hotel food, ok."}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual atmosphere after relaxing at the pool all day while staying at the phonecian. While it was casual and had a good atmosphere, the food was not very good. I got the burger which was just okay. My mom got the wings and soup. She liked the wings but not the soup. The restaurant could use a couple more options on their menus. The staff was nice though!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, great beer selection, great staff and all at a premier resort.  Woo hoo!  I have had a bunch of different burgers in my years, but The Cowboy was the best!"}
{"text":"Hop knot. Pickles. Black bean burger."}
{"text":"Cool spot to hangout after a round of golf.  It's located at the Phoenician Resort at the golf clubhouse area.  Some friends and I popped in after a round for a bite to eat and some drinks.  It was raining that day, so we camped out next to the fireplace to dry off.  We were soaking wet from playing golf all day in the rain and since it was the end of Summer, the AC was cranked on full tilt here.  To warm ourselves up we ordered a shot of premium Patron Tequila and I had a glass of Woodford Reserve Bourbon, neat.  The Tequila went down smooth and warmed me up real fast.  I savored the Bourbon and sipped it slowly while enjoying the conversation about our day of golf and other random things.  For food, we decided to order some Onion Rings ($8), Garlic Fries ($7), and Chips & Salsa w/Guacamole ($14).  We shared the appetizers.  They were very good and a perfect snack to enjoy while we hung out.  Our waitress was very attentive and made sure our glasses weren't empty.  One of the guys in our group volunteered to pick up the tab because he lost a bet on the golf course....which was good because the shot of premium Patron was $45....wait, what?!  Overall, it was a good time.  Next time I try the Burgers on the menu.  Return Factor - 87%"}
{"text":"My friend and I had just finished with massages at the wellness center at the Phoenician, and we decided to try Relish for happy hour. I'm so glad we did! We both ordered (several) margaritas, and at $6 a piece they were absolutely perfect! We also got some things to share, including the tacos, wings, and onion rings. Typical happy hour food, but done really well and they hit the spot. The highlight was definitely the s'more plate! Overall a great place to unwind and have excellent food at the same time!"}
{"text":"Lie about Happy Hour prices, won't go back."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Indiana and decided to head to Old Town for dinner. On our way, our Lyft driver suggested Relish and we decided to go. The service was great! Although the atmosphere wasn't anything special, the food/drinks made up for it. Try the Cobb and Cowboy burgers ( paired with tater tots), and a Adult Milkshake. You won't regret it. Very high quality Kobe."}
{"text":"There are many places that I've gone to that deserve a half star, as the next level is questionable - RBB deserves 4.5 stars in my opinion.  My fiance and I decided to go to Relish on a Sunday, which happened to be Father's Day.  We heard good things, especially being at the Phoenician, so we thought to see how the burger would deliver.  After getting to RBB, I quickly spotted the pulled pork sliders (an appetizer), and coming from NC, I am a sucker for trying pulled pork at nearly any place.  Knowing it was a burger spot, It was a toss-up between the sliders or the Cowboy.  My fiance decided on the Cowboy, and so I knew I could have the best of both worlds.  My only issue was that I also wanted to try their tater tots as neighboring tables already had their meals and they looked delicious.  So the obvious choice was to get the sliders and the tots, but our server informed us of their special that day, which happened to be the pulled pork sandwich WITH tots.  I knew I had made a good decision when their special was an entire sandwich of what I originally wanted.  I was super satisfied with my decision.  The pulled pork had an interesting BBQ sauce coupled with jalapeno slaw, much different than your average pulled pork sandwich, but scrumptious nonetheless.  The tots were insanely good, served in the cutest little fryer basket.  The tots are more than your sonic-style, semi-soggy tots; they're fresh and crispy, and about as upscale as you can make a tot.  My fiance's burger was to die for.  When we go back, I'll definitely opt for a burger as they've got something going on in a good way.  It must be the quality of meat or the bun or something, but I was slightly regretsy that I didn't go for the Cowboy.  Whatever you get, be sure to include tots and their signature tea (I think it was prickly pear or something).  I'm looking forward to trying their homemade root beer and their BBQ chicken nachos in round 2.  As a bonus, we saw a PHX Suns player with his family.  Neither of us were star struck, but it made for a fun meal knowing that we were dining at spot on Father's day with an NBA player.  That's when you know you've made a decent decision for your Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"Kobe style Wagyu burgers on homemade brioche buns.  That's the starting point for this edge-of-Phoenician burger bistro.  I had the Bourbon Peppercorn and it leaves just the right amount of pepper heat on your tongue.  Great topping mix with caramelized onions and blue cheese.  At $20 a burger has to stand out and this one delivered.  Nice, simple menu selection - not too busy but something for everyone.  I didn't try it but next time I might have to add the Adult Chocolate Shake with Van Gogh Chocolates Vodka and Godiva Chocolate Liqueur."}
{"text":"My southwestern burger was too gooey with cheese and green chile and pork rinds(!) but tasted pretty good.  The price is high but portions are ridiculously large.  The space in the golf clubhouse is pretty cool and inviting.  Like the tater tots."}
{"text":"No joke of a meal..they started by bringing the best humus I ever had. Warm and made to order followed by pickled vegetables that was also one of the best I had. Coming from a pickled vegetable and humus expert...Alex nailed it!!!!  I didn't think it could get any better but it did when they brought out the warm cookie and ice cream. The veggie burger was also absolutely amazing. Will definitely be back here :)"}
{"text":"You have to order their fried pickles for an appetizer. They came out piping HOT and really good. I had the lettuce wedge appetizer which was just the item to start my dinner. I ordered the mushroom burger, my wife had the knife and fork burger and my daughter had the BLT burger. I thought for sure my bun was soaked in the juices from the burger, but behold, it was dry and light. The tater tots was awesome, haven't had them since my kids were little. To finish the meal off, we ordered the S'MORES. What an eye catching sight when they brought out hot charcoal in a square ceramic style pot, flame dancing on the charcoal, marshmallows, graham crackers and Hershey chocolate. We were acting like kids in a candy store making our S'MORES."}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 3 to 3.5 stars.  The food was good and warranted a 4, but the prices will make you do a double take.  Most of the burgers are $16 a pop.  I guess what can you expect from a high end resort restaurant.  The best thing to do is to take advantage of their happy hour specials that run daily from 3 pm to 7 pm.  They have specials like $5 margaritas, $3 Mexican beers and they put out awesome crab cake sliders and BBQ chicken nachos.    I'd highly recommend coming out to try out the happy hour specials if you have a hunger craving in the late afternoon."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there Sunday 5/22, our 3rd time there in the past few months.  We arrived ~6PM and sat at a window seat.  The golf course is a lovely view as the sun sets and the shadows lengthen.  The complementary chips and salsa were fine.  The quesadillas were the best I've had in years. The chicken wings were juicy and good, though $12.95 for ten of them seems a bit steep.  The garlic fries were very tasty. We split the Cowboy Burger, a huge slab of burger with lots of toppings, moist and flavorful.  Beware that this item will set you back nearly $20, a fact not well advertised on the menu. Though you pay a little more here than at other places that sell \"bar food\", we think it is worth it for the wonderful ambience and the overall excellence of the food."}
{"text":"I have come here on several occasions, one of which was with my extended family. Relish Burger Bistro staff was more than accommodating and gave us our own little room so we could have privacy. They were timely in regards to drinks and food and even considerately split burgers in half for those who were splitting. Their burgers are all amazing, as well as their sliders and fried pickles. The Phoenician Iced Tea is amazing as well! Another time for my dad's birthday I asked them do something special for him and they came out with a pizookie and on the plate had written happy birthday with my dad's name on it. The personal touches and service they provide truly goes above and beyond at this place. I highly recommend this restaurant for any sort of occasion. You can do drinks here, since they do have many tvs or also ask for something more private and sit on the patio overlooking the golf course even. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Best black bean burger I ever had, and the fried pickles were very interesting."}
{"text":"Most of the items on their happy hour menu were mediocre. But then we had the beef sliders. Goodness, gracious. They were some of the best sliders that I have ever tasted.  For me,  one out of four dishes being amazing doesn't warrant anything above 3 stars. Otherwise, service is great. Lots of TV screens to watch games after a round of golf. Great casual place to dine while you're staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"Well if you are in the mood for some ridiculously overpriced burgers then this is the place for you. We went with another couple we invited along because I had a $50 gift card but little did I know that would only end up covering half the bill for the four of us. We did order one shared appetizer and we also each had a beer but man that is still a pretty high bill for a burger joint. You might be thinking that you are paying for the ambiance since it is at the Phoenician but nope it is in the same building as the golf clubhouse and so there was nothing too fancy about it. We decided to eat outside on the porch which had outdoor type patio furniture with cushions that were really dirty and worn. I don't know why people were raving about the view. Pretty much all you can see is the golf course. The service was not too great either. The bartender was friendly enough but out waitress outside ignored us for a good while. The burgers themselves were tasty but definitely not worth $18. You could tell the beef was high quality and tasted good but they were all pretty small and thin patties. Overall good burgers but not the best I've had and not worth that kind of money."}
{"text":"I am a foodie with over 20 years restaurant experience. I happened to golf today at the Phoenician and after my round I wanted a quick bite so my buddy and I went upstairs to check out Relish.  Bar was BEAUTIFUL, service was spot on.  Food was delectable. Largest selection of Tequila in the STATE!  Great beer list, LARGE tv's  Cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"A little pricey, even for a gourmet burger, but the burger was good. We sat on the balcony, and enjoyed a view of the golf course. The service was lacking a little (we had to find a waitress when we first sat down and continued to look for someone for refills for water).  This place is on my list of top burger places in the valley but just be prepared for the bill."}
{"text":"Unless you are in the area I don't think this place is worth the drive. Don't get me wrong the food was good, but you have to park and find your way the restaurant while you walk through the resort area. Relish wasn't busy like I expected it would be. It is just a little resort restaurant over the golf course. Tater tots were on point and the burger was very good. This place is a once in a lifetime place. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again though."}
{"text":"Best burger in town without a doubt. Flavorful - super beefy, juicy, and delicious!   You see a lot of gourmet burger places opening up all over town, but, none of them hold a candle to this place. The prices are on the upper end but, reasonable (e.g. about $16/plate)   The grounds are beautiful and great to walk after dinner. Possibly up the the ice cream shop in the main building?? (their strawberry iced cream is home made and beyond delicious!)"}
{"text":"Came here with my friends family; there were ten of us. First time coming here , and it was a tad tricky to find (and I am talking about the location and then the actual front door restaurant) Luckily, there are people to ask where to go and it's not a ton of traffic.   The restaurant is upstairs and has a dining room and a bar area. Neither were overly crowded which was really nice.   I ordered the turkey burger with tater tots. One of the guys in my group told me it's the best turkey burger he has ever had, so I had to try it ! It came out and it was a very good size turkey burger, and when I bit in, it was full of flavor! There's a sweetness to it and there's a big piece of gouda on the burger ( which was my favorite part !)  I also feel that a lot of turkey burgers become very dry and this burger was nice and juicy !  Even my friend who isn't a big fan of burgers tried someone's and she loved it! Tater tots were good but the fries looked super good to, I had a hard time deciding.   Definitely do not pass up dessert! They had this deal if you picked a certain burger you could also get dessert and it was one price. I don't remember the price but it was very good for dinner and dessert. The dessert was a big churro doughnut with caramel ice cream. It was PHENOMENAL! I definitely would go back for that!  We also ordered S'Mores for the table and it comes out with it's own flame so you can roast your own marshmallow and build your own s'more! Pretty cute idea.   Overall, it was good and I would like to come back and try happy hour in the bar area, or maybe sit outside on the patio. The burgers are definitely pricey so don't come here thinking you will get out cheap; but food is very good quality."}
{"text":"Burger was dry and overcooked. Not to mention PRICEY! Also, I don't need a pickle and pepper on a skewer through my burger. Cheesy. On a Bloody Mary, fine. But this is just juvenile.  Hate the metal \"deep fry basket\" of tots/fries served on the plate with the burger. Too cute by half - plus, do I need to be reminded by the basket that I'm eating something that just came out of the deep grease? Also, it just makes the plate look weak and bare.  Decor is awful...this place won't last."}
{"text":"Breathtakingly good. Came here for dinner when we were staying at the Phoenician and got the summer deal $20 for a burger and a dessert. Super good deal and it was worth every penny! The burger came with tater tots which were perfectly made. And the desserts were just... Unbelievably good. I have not had such a satisfying meal in a long time. Also have to mention the great service!"}
{"text":"I loved this casual dining experience at the gorgeous Phoenician.  I stopped in for happy hour with some friends, and we had a great time.  We sat in front of the fireplace and sipped beers over appetizers.  The location alone is worth going for, but the food was good and service was even better."}
{"text":"$16 kobe burger worth every penny. The tater-tots are just icing on the cake. Did I mention this place has one of the best tequila selections I have ever seen and a respectable beer selection to boot?"}
{"text":"In addition to being a few steps from our hotel room at The Phoenician, Relish is actually a really great burger place!   They specialize in Kobe burgers, made your way, and the most amazing tater tots. I definitely recommend adding carmelized onions to the burger.   My only other tip: they twice confused adding a grilled poblano chile to the burger vs. Kobe beef ground chile, so be sure to specify.  Relish is perfect for after a round of golf, or a casual meal at the resort. Service is what you would expect from The Phoenician, excellent."}
{"text":"Relish is the perfect place for a gluttonous day of binge eating, drinking and watching gigantic TV's.  (And possibly play golf at the Phoenician - you know, if you're into that sort of thing..)  First off:   1) Impressive Beer list, organized into easy to understand categories.  2) Extremely large selection of tequila for those who prefer not remember their actions from the afternoon.  3) Alcoholic Milk Shakes.  Alcoholic. Milk. Shakes.  4) And an incredibly delicious list of burgers in all shapes and, more importantly - sizes.  Because Gluttony is my favorite sin (unless drunkenness is a sin, at which point it'd be #3 after drunkenness annnnd drunkenness)   Either way, because Gluttony is my *favorite* sin - I went with the Big Bertha which is a glorious tower made from 1lb of Kobe beef and cheese.  This may sound like overkill or a waste of food to those reading this review - This may also sound like it'd be more delicious with the additions of Guacamole and Bacon, which is exactly how it sounded to me.    This delicious monstrosity took me to the ropes, and even with my girlfriend's help - it took every ounce of strength and inch of room we had in us to take it down.  And it was worth the battle.    I will definitely come back again and I will most certainly recommend this place to others.    The only change that I'd make for next time is to make sure to reserve a room at the Phoenician before hand - this way I can spend my foodcoma in peace."}
{"text":"My wife liked her ahi tuna sandwich especially that you can have it on a bed of slaw with sweet potato fries on the side. Serves the purpose for quick lunch if you're on the property. Otherwise, this place it Is really kind of what you'd expect from a hotel restaurant. Overpriced beer, decent service and decent food."}
{"text":"Love the bar and club house feel. Cold beer, sliders, and potato tots! Nice way to spend a few hours and watch the Masters."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for lunch. He ordered the burger, $29.00 I ordered a salad with grilled chicken, about $16.00 His meal came with cold tater tots. The egg was actually brown around the edges. Not sure if that is normal. But his burger was good. My salad was good though the chicken was unseasoned and charred also cold. Drinks. $$$ Not worth the splurge.  The bright spot. Ambiance and service was great! Will not revisit though :("}
{"text":"Unique and awesome presention.  Burgers are TALL, buns are awesome and the presentation is one of a kind! The fries (sweet potatoe, garlic, etc come in a mini basket that looks like they were just fried up at the hamburger joint! THICK milkshakes if that's what you like and great tequila if that's your preference! (oh - fried pickles!)  Prices, for a resort, not too bad."}
{"text":"Delicious food, beautiful view of the golf course, great service! THE place to go for a Kobe burger! I got the Cobb burger, bunless with sweet potato waffle fries. The burger was cooked perfectly. The heirloom tomatoes were fresh and juicy. My husband got the Ahi sandwich which was good, but he wished he got a Kobe burger after tasting mine :) Nice selection for kids as well. The food is pricey, but worth the splurge. Best to go during the day so you can enjoy the view. There is parking just past the restaurant (just follow the signs). Do not park in the main resort parking area unless you want to walk a bit. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down - best nachos in town. Great service and awesome food. I recommend sitting outside if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Wayyyy too expensive for what it is. Super extensive and expensive tequila menu, some fun local beers that aren't too pricey, and a burger bar menu. Bartenders were super friendly and the decor is nice."}
{"text":"Always great food! Their burgers are great. Their margaritas are delicious! The atmosphere is lovely, a dining room or bar to choose from all elevated on the second story with a great view."}
{"text":"On the Phoenician resort grounds, the environment is spectacular & provides a nice comfortable yet luxurious experience.    The burger bar is classy and inviting with an excellent array tequila & beer to choose from.  My go to is the cowboy without the jalapeno's & it's the only $19 burger I've ever encountered that is deserving of that price point.  The quality of ingredients & consistent production really shine thru on this burger.    I have no complaints about Relish, can't wait to come back here as well as explore all of the other offerings of the Phoenician."}
{"text":"I went to Relish with my family and a few friends (party was 4 adults and 1 20 month old).  When we entered the restaurant the manager asked if we would be joining them for dinner.  I said, \"Yes, we have a reservation under Scott at 6:30.\"  Without looking at the reservations screen, the manager said, \"Of course Mr. Pate, we have a table all ready for you on the patio.\"  I was impressed that my arrival had been anticipated.  We were seated at a large round table on the patio with a highchair, kid's activity book, and crayons all set up and ready.  Our server stopped by a few minutes later and took our drink and appetizer orders.  My wife was having trouble finding the kid's menu and the server directed her to it in the back of the kid's activity book.  You can also order anything from the kid's menus at any of the other restaurants on the property if there is nothing on the Relish kid's menu that you like, but they did warn us it would take a little longer since it would need to be delivered across the property.  We put in a cheese burger kid's order right away as well.  The appetizers came out quickly.  We ordered the BBQ Chicken Nachos and the Cornbread Skillet for the table.  They were both great.  We actually ended up ordering a second Cornbread Skillet because it was so good.  Service throughout the evening was perfect and friendly.  They have lots of great local beers on their menu which our friend enjoyed a Peach Beer from Four Peeks (she said it tasted more like a cocktail than a beer though - it's pretty sweet).  My 20 month old son got 2 kid sized cheese burgers and a basket of tater tots that kept him busy throughout the meal.  He ended up eating the cheese burgers \"top-down\" starting with the bun and working his way toward the middle, but he loved every bite.  For our entrees, three of us had burgers (the Cowboy Burger is their most popular and two of us had that, I had the blue cheese burger because I can't pass up blue cheese).  The burgers were good, but I would say that they were the least impressive part of our meal over all.  Each one comes with a basket of tater tots, but you can sub the tots out for a variety of other sides for an additional cost of $3.50.  The fourth adult in our party ordered a Wilcox Apple Salad and the Chili Verde from the appetizer menu.  Honestly, that seemed like the best way to go.  If you are going for dinner, I would recommend one of their entrees or a salad/appatizer combo over a burger.  Not that the burgers are bad, just that there is so much more interesting on the menu.  For dessert, we ordered their s'mores dessert.  It comes out with a large ceramic pot with burning coals inside and a selection of graham crackers, marshmallows, and chocolate around the edge of the plate.  You take the marshmallows, put them on the skewers that are provided, and roast them right at the table.  It was a really fun dessert.  Overall, the service was excellent and the food was great.  We like Relish and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Happened by here by accident ... Goes to show you that good things can come from an error in direction.   The atmosphere is amazing, as well as, the view !!   We opted for the balcony, so we could enjoy the golf course view.  There were fans to keep the air circulating providing a comfortable environment.   Our server, Rachel was both friendly and helpful while we made our choices for lunch.  She provided us with most popular and with her favorites.   Now ... The food was amazing !!!!   We decided to split the Cowboy Burger and the  Sonoran Chicken Wings.   It was split onto separate plates by the kitchen staff, which made for a nice presentation.   The burger came with crispy tater tots making for a special twist to the norm of fries.   We will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was not desirable. No one around to seat us and when we finally found an employee they seemed annoyed to seat us. What we ordered fit into their special but we were not told of it and payed more with getting less. Weird experience. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The husband and I came here for their lovely happy hour! The prices here are generally pretty steep (you can't get a burger for less than a whopping 16$), but the happy hour has some serious deals. We tried the wagyu burger sliders (3$ each) and the pulled pork sliders (5$ for 3 of them). Surprisingly, the burger sliders were not the stars... they put too much thousand island on them which buried the taste of the meat (which is why the burger is so expensive, right?)... They certainly weren't bad, but I wish the flavor of the meat came through more. The star was the pork slider... these things were legit! The sauce was delicious, tangy and spicy. The slaw on top was crisp and added the texture the sliders needed. The portion was large for 5$ (on the reg menu, this same dish is 13$!!!). I would come back for these sliders. For drinks, the husband had a beer and I had a marg... the marg was a good size for the happy hour price, but the flavor was nothing special. Anyway, I will most likely return for happy hour and would like to come for brunch (the menu looks awesome and they have a brunch burger with an egg and hollandaise on it.... sounds great to me!)."}
{"text":"Love it.  I can share because of larger portion.  Good meat....good everything."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner last evening with my daughter after work. Wesat inside and pretty much had the place to ourselves. We were able to relax and unwind. The staff was polite and didn't rush us. The service and food was great. We shared the entree sized AZ Farmers salad which was romaine with cojita cheese, black beans, corn and a great dressing that was light with a touch of sweetness and plenty for both of us. Since we were there during Happy Hour we also ordered 4 Wagu sliders at $4.00 each. I normally don't like sliders because I have found most to be very greasy but these weren't greasy at all. the buns were crisply toasted and the burger juicy and cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of a very tasty relish. We also shared the sweet potato waffle fries what are sooo good, crispy and the ketchup fits just right in the nooks and crannies. It was certainly enough food for both of us but we had to try the waffle churro with ice cream for dessert. Its a very dense creamy vanilla ice cream that is between 2 freshly made warm churro waffles, soft inside, slight waffle crunchiness on the outside and delicious churro flavor,  drizzled with caramel syrup. It was devoured in minutes. We will certainly return."}
{"text":"Relish is an awesome place to get an good burger and a great view at the same time.... If you're willing to pay for it. Located at the Phoenician, Relish offers quality Kobe beef burgers with some unique toppings.   We decided to start with the 8 dollar fried pickles and they were served piping hot with a side of ranch dressing. I really liked them but my wife was put off by how rubbery the pickles became from being so hot. She enjoyed the cool pickle on her burger much more. I'm usually not a big pickle fan but I loved them... I think I'm just a fried stuff fan.   Our 16 dollar burgers came out and were presented very nicely. We loved how the tater tots come in little fry baskets. The meat on my cowboy burger didn't taste as good as Kobe burgers that I have had at other establishments but it was good. My wife got an original burger and added avocado on to it and I actually liked hers more than mine.   We tried the cookie dessert and were very disappointed. There was a very odd taste in the cookie at certain spots and was very off putting. We didn't eat much of it.   If you are in the area and in the mood for a great burger, I think you can do better. However the view and ambiance of the place make it worth a look."}
{"text":"Such a gorgeous space overlooking the golf course at the Phoenician. We were lucky enough to be seated on the patio as the sun went down and it was just breezy and spectacular viewing. I love how the desert looks at sunset. We all had a burger - four different burgers to be exact and they were all absolutely positively some of the best burgers ever. Great flavor, cooked to perfection, and the tator tots on the side were just about unbeatable. Love the presentation! Service here was good but a bit harried. Maybe she was just busy, I don't know. My water was never re-filled and that always bugs me that I have to ask. But the food and the ambiance was terrific and I'll come back for more again and again."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! Hubby and I ate here last night. The 7 layer dip appetizer was a perfect start. I highly recommend the Short rib burger. Yummm. Hubby got the chili and corn bread and raved over the corn bread. If ever back in this area we will stop here again."}
{"text":"If you want to wait an hour and a half for a hamburger then this is the place for you. The service is few and far between as well so ration your drinks like you're California and need water."}
