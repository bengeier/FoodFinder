{"text":"My parents dragged me here for lunch after our trip to Ikea. I really hate buffets so I didn't expect much at all. And I was right. This place was terrible. The majority of the food here is defrosted. I don't get why anyone would want to eat here. For $13 per person, you can order about 2 dishes for a lunch special at a much better and cleaner Chinese restaurant that's not a buffet."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and decorations. The atmosphere is typical mainland china style. Kind of garish and over the top and showy. Nothing understated here. But it is a change of pace from the typical generic styling you usually see. The name in chinese is not actually china buffet but rather summer palace which refers to an historic site north of beijing which is not necessarily a proud moment in chinese history but historic and a fabulous place to visit and on most tourist's list when in that area. The real summer palace is the definition of over the top. Anyways on to the food itself. The food is decent, you will most likely find at least 2-3 things that will satisfy you when you visit as they have a wide range of dishes. I will point out the highlights. First off, the hibachi grill is good, always, always get that first and they have scallops. The soup is another decent item. The rolls here are not worth much in my book and i always pass them up. The steamed fish is very good. One very unique item here is the frogs legs. How many chinese buffets serve frogs legs every day? In my opinion, this is not the best chinese buffet in the area but it has the most variety and noisy typical \"chinese\" atmosphere. Which is a good thing when you are in the mood, if not you may find it too noisy which I sometimes do. I do enjoy coming here for lunch and sometimes dinner."}
{"text":"We felt the buffet was pretty good for buffet standard.  Husband even liked it .  They were always bringing hot foods."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese buffet. The only downside is that there's not a lot of vegetarian options. I have a full review with pictures of the interior and exterior of the restaurant on my blog here: ( http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/04/china-buffet-mayfield-heights.html )   Yes, there are a lot of chicken dishes, but I love chicken. The honey chicken is the best. The waitresses are attentive and I never run out of diet coke to drink and empty plates never pile up at the table."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken tasted like rubber. Water tasted like kerosene. Very expensive for a buffet..more expensive than Golden Corral.. and mostly seafood."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, ended up getting food poisoning. My friend didn't get sick and he didn't eat the sushi and mussels which I did."}
{"text":"Quite a good experience. A group of eight of us went for lunch around 12:30pm. The place was quite busy thus accounting for the quick turn over in buffet food. The food was outstanding! There was soooo much food and everything I had was fresh and presented well. I had four plates of food (and Im not a huge eater). For 4.50 all you can eat, the value of this place is as good as it gets. As it was a buffet, I cannot comment on service albeit the waitress did promptly seat us, take our drink orders, and get our drinks to us quickly. Plenty of parking as its in a shopping center. Lastly, the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Depends really when you go. I find lunch to be less sleezy, but over all is good, they have good sushi, and a decent section of veg and a few vegan items. Great service though, you will feel like the your being served by what customer service used to be. Great service, decent food, not so great prices, but is for sure worth it every time me and my wife go."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the Chinese food back home"}
{"text":"We went at around 5:30 on a  Tuesday evening and the place was fairly busy.  The egg drop soup was delicious, and the highlight of the meal.  The only other two dishes that were warm enough were the Walnut chicken and the steamed clams.  There were a lot of high value items at the buffet, crab legs and shrimp and the like, but most of it was dried out and not as tasty as it looked. There was a wide selection ans some interesting choices, like clams smothered in cheddar cheese.    I guess this is Arizona, and I should not have been surprised that next to the sweet and sour sauce there was a tub of gravy.  There was also obligatory Chinese buffet pizza.  I don't eat any of these picky eater accommodation foods, so cannot comment on their flavor. They had a wide variety of deserts, too, including a sundae bar.  i had the green tea ice cream and it was okay, there were a couple of ice crystals in it.   The place was more expensive than I thought it would be.  I think the price range should be adjusted to Moderate $$.   I did not try the sushi, but there was a chef preparing it as we watched and it looked good."}
{"text":"Polite staff and the food is always excellent with a great variety of choices. Yum, love the hibachi grill and very casual environment. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have braved this \"restaurant\" twice. Dried food stuck on silverware, glasses, and plates. The food on the buffet was cold and tasted old. The odd food selections are maybe a cross between southern style and fake Chinese. Wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the some of the best Chinese food I have had ever. Even compared to normal sit down restaurants! They have an enormous selection with always fresh very delicious food to chose from! They've officially got my regular business :)"}
{"text":"Great selection, fresh sushi an pho, will definitely drive 20 min out of the way for this buffet! Drinks constantly refilled, better experience than going out to dinner at a regular restaurant! Great job!"}
{"text":"First and last time. Poor service, bad tasting food with very low quality. We don't expect much from cheap buffet, but food should be at least safe to eat and has a taste... Will never come back... They recently raise their price as well... The price posted on yelp is not accurate anymore."}
{"text":"Nov 4 2015 Been going here since it opened. Bringing family&friends. This night now being the LAST TIME EVER! Diet soda, looked like a beer on ice had no syrup. Had to tell server.By time I got new drink I was dine eating first plate of appetizers, that wr good. 2nd plate:went for typical hot dishes w shrimp. Each one unedible! Like erasers! Noodles over cooked &gummy, didn't eat. Fried rice burnt egg&dried up peas. I couldn't eat nothing on 2nd plate. My empty glass sat thr waiting for refill! Never did we get a refill! $3.00 for half a drink, rest was ice. Server took my debit card&I said wait! Use a complaint! He ran it anyways. I wanted to1meal comped, or the drinks at very least. I talked to a manager&explained all. Also how this was our 32 anniversary dinner. My husband was so mad about the food also&said let's go. Not wanting ti try no other dishes. He had just fried shrimp&rubbery! I'm in middle of having major dental work. Many teeth pulled. My mouth just healed. So going for a fancy steak dinner wasn't possible. We drove 1.5hrs to go thr! One way! Knowing thr be soft dishes I could eat. Instead I'm also sick to my stomach on long ride home! All night long &now it's noon the next day&my intestines are paying for the small bite of something? I had to give 1star to continue w review. Otherwise none! I now understand why all the other China Buffets are CLOSING DOWN , In all other CITIES! DO NOT GO HERE! Used to send everyone to this place for many years. SADLY I'LL BE TELLING THEM TO STOP! Normally I wouldn't bother w a review. I HAD TO, FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR HEALTH&WALLET! SHAME on woman management blowing me off. Prob thought cuz my lower side teeth wr missing I was a piece of trash.looking for free meal. I was embarrassed enuf to be out in public until my dentist finishes my dental restoration. My husband said don't be, let's go out &enjoy ourselves&you don't have to cook. Instead I'm sick&had to speak!"}
{"text":"Located on the expanding Independence expressway, the parking lot can sometimes be difficult to get into, but the overall location is fairly ideal. The décor is modern and comparatively stylish, there are no cheesy Asian wallpaper or cheap paper lanterns. It is kept neat and clean and the service is decent. The regular buffet selection is pretty good but the hibachi selection is even better. Their chefs are willing to cater to reasonable requests. Don't pile items on your plate during your first pass just based on looks. Take small samples and find out what you like best. The staff is very efficient at removing your finished plates. I recommend the grilled salmon, the crawfish, the Maryland-style crabs, the grilled pork chops and the beef with broccoli. The mussels are okay but very small, the BBQ ribs are adequate and the frog legs are not bad, but also not great. Taste everything before you season it. A lot of the grilled meats are already a little salty. The sushi is very good for a buffet-style restaurant and continuously prepared throughout lunch and dinner. The tempura and California rolls were fresh and the spicy salmon and tuna were good with some wasabi and soy added. The seaweed salad is excellent and they have a couple of sashimi options as well. The sushi is not as fancy and first rate as a proper sushi restaurant, but if you are craving a lot of sushi at a baseline price, I definitely recommend it. They also offer a take-out option priced by the pound. Stay away from heavy sauces and bone-in meats and the cost will be comparable to standard takeout."}
{"text":"The place is just beautiful and elegant. The food was so delicious. You pick your meat, vegetables, noodles etc.. take it up to the man at the hibachi grill and get it cooked with a sauce of your choice. I got steak, mixed vegetables, noodles and vegetable fried rice and had all cooked in soy sauce. I would highly recommend visiting this restaurant. The staff was really helpful, kind, and I received prompt service."}
{"text":"Food is good. The staff is very diligent. Recommended if you are looking for a good buffet."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The food is always fresh, and the wonton soup is the best I've had. Gave it a 4 because it is smaller than other buffets, but we still get plenty to eat. Atmosphere is relaxing."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here tonight only because we had a coupon. The food was awful. It was not fresh at all and everything tasted funny. When we asked why it was gross we were handed the check. They do not care about customer service here. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"My first time at this location. This buffet was very clean and the food was not disappointing. It's your typical buffet selection with a few extra items that you don't see offered at the other China Buffet chains. The sushi selection was decent, but could use a little more variety. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. I called a day in advance to make reservations for a party of 30. We had only one waiter assisting us, but she was great! A 12% gratituity was added to the bill for a big party. I will definitely go back again in the future."}
{"text":"Definately will pick this buffet place over Tin Tin for these reasons:  -price is worth what you pay for and will cost less then Tin Tin -less variety, more quality food -great sushi selection, you will find sushi rolls at this place that you will not find at other chinese buffets and you won't be disappointed! The sushi here are way more quality then other places.  -I love their seafood stir fry dish with the shrimp and crab meat.  -love their jello!  -great service, they are always refilling your drink (sometime way sooner then you want them to)"}
{"text":"Same owner of the China Buffet in Pineville off of Lee Street. They had really outdone themselves with the one in the University area. The interior and exterior design of this place is nice and inviting. They have a better selection here and offers a hibachis grill station.   I do however feel that this place does not offer the same quality sushi as they do in Pineville, but they do however offer a BIGGER dish variety selection compare to the one in Pineville. All in all its a good place to eat at when you are in the mood for Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Very average run of the mill buffet. Prices are above average. Nothing special but not awful"}
{"text":"The staff here is very friendly and the place is very clean! The food isn't bad and it's consistent."}
{"text":"Decided to stop for lunch even after all the bad reviews. It wa around noon and place was a little busy. Asked to see the buffet befor being seated. Everything looked fresh so stayed and ate. Everything  was very delicious. I'll be returning when I come back this way"}
{"text":"This seemed like a good idea from reading all these reviews. I was looking forward to eating thier sushi. After my first dish trying out a few types of the sushi I got up to take a look around what else they had and realized my stomach was hurting. I took a small plate of a few things and sat down across my husband who looked at me and said he is so bloated he can barely eat. He mentioned that many of these places but baking soda in the food to make you feel full and not eat as much. I hadn't heard that theory.... But the way my stomach felt, I thought for sure something was wrong. I left there so bloated, without being able to eat much. Perhaps it was because all of thier food is covered in thick, heavy sauces, but either way..... Save you self and go somewhere else. It's not worth the $12.99."}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoy eating at the China Buffet on independence several times a month.  This restaurant is well decorated restaurant with its modern, clean and relaxing ambience.  The offerings includes many delicious Chinese, American and other Asian foods to choose from including a fresh salad bar, desserts and premium ice cream.  We often enjoy the wonderful seafood or duck soup that are prepared to order or pile up a plate for a fresh stir-fry from the hibachi grill.   The fresh seafood includes many varieties of shrimp, crabs, mussels, crawfish, etc. as well as hand-rolled sushi.    The friendly staff will ensure that your needs are well met."}
{"text":"Came back for dinner again, it was great like always. Food was hot and fresh, sushi was awesome and fresh.  My family love coming here, it's our weekly come to place."}
{"text":"Wish I had seen the Health Dept. score before I ate here. There is no reason for a restaurant to have a 92. The food was cold, almost like the hot tables were not working. Somebody should tell them to put Garlic in the green beans. One of our group had them warm her food up on the grill.  The servers were great...they got the star from me. Well, excuse me, I have to go back to the bathroom for the third time since I have been home. Never eating there again, heck with how pretty the place is inside!"}
{"text":"i heard something like they are closing like in 2 month they will keep it open as long as there is a large amount of people going in the next 2 months sooo invite ur friends so we dont loose a wonderful buffet"}
{"text":"Family run and what nice people. Great service. Awesome sushi..... The sushi chef is from China town in NY and let me tell you he is amazing. He works Thur-Sunday. He just trained a new guy to cover his days off and he is very good as well. But if you have a chance go, go Thurs-Sun. The taste as well as presentation is unreal. They have a tempora house special that is to die for. I go once every two weeks sometimes more. I think im going to go again today because writing this review is making me hungry."}
{"text":"Horrendous!  I did not enjoy one item I tried. Even the fried rice was bad. Thats a first, which I never thought was possible. The hibachi grill seemed promising, but I was so put off by the experience I didnt take the chance. My first and only time I will step foot in this establishment. Save yourself and go someplace else."}
{"text":"I have taken my Love and the two kids here four times now.  Our youngest loves this restaurant.  It is becoming a regular stop for us almost weekly.  We have learned that it is more enjoyable on weeknights because it is less crowded than weekends, and that really makes a difference for a buffet.  There is always enough food, but it is much easier to load up your plate when you have some space.  The food is decent for the price.  The wait staff is good, and the atmosphere appropriate."}
{"text":"I recently ate at this restaurant with my fiancé after normal lunch hours.   As others have said, the interior is pretty nice, though it's almost crossing that line of being a bit gaudy. The food is the standard for what you would expect for a Chinese buffet, but what stands out is the selection. Sushi, a hibachi grill, and selected Chinese and American dishes are available. Nothing really stands out taste-wise. The food isn't bad, but nothing that is amazing. The price is reasonable for the amount of selection and the service was good.   I'll give this place another try in the future and hopefully the food will match the look of the place."}
{"text":"We always go for the buffet meal.  Best to go right between noon and 1 pm or at 5 to 6pm in the evening when the food is fresh.  We frequent this restaurant on a monthly basis.  During the day you will find, sushi  but in the evenings, you will find sashimi, large steamed crab legs, blue crab, fresh oysters, clams, beef, chicken shrimp, scallps and many more items to choose from. I have never gotten sick from their food.  They offer senior prices and are the best in town."}
{"text":"I gave this one star only because I didn't have a choice of none which is what i would have put...none! This place is horrible, not a good selection and what there was there it was terrible. There was a smell of mold around the buffet. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The place was not very clean and the table felt as if there was a film on it as well as on the silverware."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town, better than Japanese upscale restaurant, it was already worth the 13 bucks dinner buffet."}
{"text":"Great food !!! I love the sushi. This place is friendly and nice. Love the place^_^.         Ps. The hibachi white sauce is amazing !"}
{"text":"Initially I was super disappointed because we've waited for a really good Chinese buffet to open up. Hibachi is great but the service is really bad. China Buffet is beautiful and great service but the few times we've been there the food has been cold or almost empty trays. We gave them another try and this time we went for lunch instead. the food was so much better and I love the fact that they have a variety of food. Thoroughly enjoyed the mango and love the fact that they serve Pho! Better safe than sorry and go for lunch when everything is the freshest:)"}
{"text":"Nice evening meal here...lots of fresh fruits.  Nice made to order soup bar..  the blue crab are fresh and tasty.  Even salad selection is healthy.  I really enjoyed dip you own ice cream and deserts also very good.  plus the restaurant is really beautiful and new...clean goes for the best reason to try here!!!"}
{"text":"This place has good food and friendly service but hardly any business. I was there on a weekday at 7 pm and I was the only person there. Not sure if that's do to panda express being  next door."}
{"text":"I went in thinking it would be pretty basic.  But this place has it all sushi, Chinese food, hibachi, lots of seafood. Everything i tried was good. Also it's nicely decorated and clean and a good price for a dinner buffet!"}
{"text":"Is this Chinese food or really the lowest grade products around. The food was horrible. With every bite you could taste the poor quality. Never again."}
{"text":"Me and my family came here looking forward to a good meal. We were very disappointed.  The manager was not kind. She was actually quite rude. The food also was not fresh. They also charged me dinner, even though we didn't have the dinner meal. The fried food was full of oil, and most of the food was dry. It was wayyyy over priced based on the bad quality. I would not recommend this place, I'm definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Food is very delicious, and a lot of kinds, the service is very good, the Chinese waiter love to smlie and cute, will continue to come?"}
{"text":"Everything I put on my plate was simply delicious.   The service was impeccable.  It was a Sunday and they were slammed packed."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. I used to hate coming to this place but my husband loved it. The food was always cold and I found a piece of rice or something in my chocolate pudding one time. The food always tasted terrible!!!! I'm so happy when China City opened up. Haven't been back since!!"}
{"text":"This buffet serves typical American Chinese food, and there's nothing special about it. The buffet is on the small side. The waiters are quick to clear away empty plates. It's not a bad place to eat, but I won't be actively seeking it out again."}
{"text":"In term of buffet, this is the best one that i've ever had. The owner is so nice he recognizes us and always gives us a huge plate of sashimi that cost at least $50 at other Japanese rest. He also sends us trays of crawfish to our table. Our whole family loves this place."}
{"text":"The food and service is great. The lunch is only 5.99 with all the sushi and salmon ......I love this place."}
{"text":"Great place for sea food. Doesn't have crabs legs but it has other variety of crustaceans. Delicious friendly staff I recommend it.."}
{"text":"Usually this place is fantastic but service was definitely not up to par this evening.   I usually get takeout sushi from the buffet but when I arrived the sushi buffet was about 75 percent empty.  I asked the sushi chef if they were making more sushi and he looked at me like he really didn't care (there was probably a language barrier but the 7 empty plates and me pointing at them should be a universal understanding).  I then asked the hostess she looked at the bar from 30 feet away and said they were making more.  We sat for about 10 minutes waiting while they rolled sushi.  They finally replenished some but for a buffet I had about 5 choices out of a normal 15.  It really wasn't busy although it was dinner time.  I will be back because this was a first time issue but hopefully it doesn't happen again."}
{"text":"Ew. Honestly. This is the first time I've gotten a to-go order from a buffet (I was working), so I don't know if it's normal to charge by weight and include the price of the box, but I thought that was strange to pay for the container my food was in. Also, there were two girls working up front and one of them had an attitude with my friend who was with me and had me wait AFTER she ran my card to see if the new girl rung our orders correctly... My friend was happy with her food, but I pretty much did not like one single thing I tried and I put about ten different things in my box. Yuck."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is decent for a $5 lunch. I don't know where else you can get AYCE for that price."}
{"text":"We have a big family and the little ones are picky. This place had something for everyone. Very clean and service was great."}
{"text":"I highly, highly recommend this place I can't say enough. The food was hot and fresh the place was very, very clean also the people very friendly! It cost $30.83 for two adults. Will definitely be going back!! We've tried several around and this place is the best."}
{"text":"It was an accidental find on the google search and I was at lunch buffet this morning (Saturday) and it was awesome! Not sure how they can provide that many items for only $11.99 and make any money.  I liked every item tasted except Sushi, but no complaints as it was a buffet quality!! Next time, I will take my office friends next time, hope they like it as well.  For such an amazing buffet, i would suggest them to raise the price to $13.99.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Food was good.....until we found hair in the peach cobbler. They felt $4 was ample compensation?"}
{"text":"No idea how this place got 5 stars it was not very good. No crab legs as someone said. Cold pork dumplings, and cold pot stickers. Price was cheap but would have rather paid for better. Value is perceptive."}
{"text":"This is best Chinese buffet in Charlotte,  the food is delicious, especially the sushi."}
{"text":"Go only when they serve dinner cos the crab other else it not good. Not worth it. And the Mexican guys that do the noodles suck. I ask for hibachi sauce n he fry me plain noodle. Smh."}
{"text":"Huge buffet... So many choices... Great variety of sea food ....beautiful interior ... Friendly staff"}
{"text":"We have always left most Chinese buffets feeling all bloated with all the sodium but we did not have that problem here. Other than that it is your typical Chinese buffet. Good flavor with plenty to select from. Could have been a little cleaner but I see with the amount of people there that it would be hard to keep up with especially with all the kids. All in all it was good and we would go back."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this Chinese buffet for the past year.  The food is pretty good, and if you don't like the buffet, you can order a lot of tasty items prepared to your liking. Try it at least once to judge for yourself.  One of my favourites is the lemon chicken. Also try the bbq spare ribs.  I go with my family and we all enjoy this no frills restaurant before heading for Burlington Vermont where we now live.  Don't expect a fancy restaurant, but if good service and tasty food prepared to your liking is important, give this place a try.  The place is always filled with locals and passers by alike."}
{"text":"Reasonable pricing for all you can eat. Delicious Chinese food. The sushi is Great! Tony is a real friendly guy. He'd make exactly what you ask for and pretty quick too. He even remembered my sister who haven't been here in over two months."}
{"text":"Poop.  Yep that is what I said.  I got the fried shrimp and after eating one (ugh) I noticed another one that had the breading around it broken off...and then I saw that it was NOT CLEANED.. yes folks that means it still had POOP in it.  Gross.    I told the manager and she said it comes in to the restaurant already fried so there was nothing they could do about it. The truth is , the whole place seems unclean. A buffet is not a place you go for the highest standards of food - but seriously this place is Sub-par.   If you want to chow down on a good buffet that is cleaner and the food is Much better - go down the road. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Disgusting! Bland, fake meats. Would never recommend. I'm not even going to waste another second on this place."}
{"text":"Have a lunch with family.  Fresh sushi and fruits.  Sushi chef and habachi chef so nice."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, crab legs are succulent and tasty. Nice service and fresh food. Not bad for the price. Sushi is AWESOME quality."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday night thinking it was Kumo.  After discovering the change in name, we thought it was still worth a try since the price was cheap.  Unfortunately,  you get what you pay for.  Two other tables were still there but had finished eating. Although it was only 7pm, none of the hot food dishes were refilled.  What was there looked like it had been sitting there all day.  The sushi selection was nonexistent.  The pot roast tasted odd.  The pan fried dumplings were as dry as cardboard."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this China buffet! You really get the biggest bang for your bucks here and food quality is consistent.  If you like sushi then this is your paradise. The price includes all you can eat sushi. Tony and Daniel will make any special rolls for you fresh every time.  It can get very crowded on the weekends but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Don't Bother to visit this restaurant.  The place is dingy and not well lit. No knives available to cut up the tough meat. There is a variety of food to choose from but overall is just mediocre at best. Almost immediately after eating I didn't feel so well."}
{"text":"Chinese food is best eaten at a buffet in my opinion. The food is exotic and usually has things in it you've never tried or even heard of for that matter. So for you to be able to try everything at least once is a great thing.  China Buffet is a local favorite because of their price and selection. They are one of the only Chinese buffets that has sushi; probably because sushi is Japanese, but I love them for it. They have seven buffet counters including the sushi one and there is very little that I have tried that I didn't like. Their prices start as low as $6.99 for lunch and with sushi being on the menu, that is stellar."}
{"text":"I have a confession to make my fellow yelpers...  I am SO sorry to say this, but I've been hiding a lil gem all to myself. China Buffet is my all-time favorite chinese food buffet. We're always greeted with a smile and a nice autmosphere, I like the sing-songy contempo chinese pop in the background, it's not too loud so it's good.   The dining area is vast and is always kept clean. The uniformed staff are always on the ball - clearing plates as soon as you take your last bite and always offer to refil drinks.  The food is very very good. I love the bbq pork. The sesame chicken & beef n broccoli are favorites of mine as well. Their wonton soup is super yummy! I always start every meal a nice bowl of a couple of 'tons. lol.   But the real attraction for me is the Sushi Bar!! Their sushi is real hit or miss... but is more hit than miss... and since it comes with the meal - it's worth atleast taking a gander at. Their salmon nigiri is always good when in stock, as is their shrimp nigir - but I have had a couple of pieces of bad tuna nigiri, which disappoints me but I still go back and give it a go. When tipped well - the sushi chef will make things to order. The sushi isn't the best in the city - by far, but it is good.   I've taken a lot of people to China Buffet and everyone liked it except for one friend who thought their abolone was gross... but abolone IS gross... regardless of where it comes from.   And so i say unto you, my fellow yelpers please forgive me for keeping this place a secret. I hope you try China Buffet and enjoy your visit. It's one of my favorite places to dine anywhere and I constantly use this place a measuring rod for the new chinese places I visit and they rarely compare."}
{"text":"Servers are not always attentive, but they are always friendly. Food is pretty good if you want an authentic type meal. Wish it had more variety of Chinese food."}
{"text":"It's actually Tibetan food, which is a more flavorful version of Chinese food. The staff are always friendly and keep the buffet full.  Update: the quality of this place has really dropped.  The food lacks any real flavor now and tastes overcooked and oversteamed.  The prices haven't changed in years, so I'm guessing the lowered the quality instead of raising the price.  The real reason it gets 1 star is they overcharged me by mistake.  My total was $9.17, they charged me $89.17.  It was a simple mistake which I noticed before I signed the receipt.  The woman didn't know how to adjust the charge on the credit card machine, so I signed the receipt and told her I'd have my bank adjust the charge.  A few days later the bank called me and said she refused to adjust the amount.  The charge was disputed, but since I signed the receipt and there was no way to prove I didn't order $89 worth of food, we lost the dispute.  I got my money back, but the bank, a local credit union, loses out on the money.  I will never eat here again.  This place messed up, and refused to fix it.  Thankfully my bank covered it, but there's no way they'll ever get my money again."}
{"text":"This is your typical chinese buffet. Pros: The decor of the place is very impressive. Beautiful wood carvings, stars in the celling and a big buffet area, sushi station and hibachi. Cons: There are to many tables for the location. Its very crowded you feel like everyone is breathing on your food.  When you get up from your table you bump into people in front and in back of you. The place smells like fish and my hair and my clothes all have that funky smell. They don't have knives only forks and spoons. You have to push your food in your plate with your fingers or with what you find. Do not ask for water it also has that funky smell and it taste terrible. Definitely will not be coming  here again."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after Christmas shopping. Loved that it had rows and rows of food to choose from and a variety of desserts as well. Staff isn't as friendly but they do a good job of getting plates and refilling. Definitely would recommend if you want to eat at a buffet in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Judging: Location, Food Quality, (Food) Variety, Service, and Decor/etc. Feel free to skip to the food variety section   Location: It is near multiple lodging areas, stores, and other competing restaurants. The area is well kept and clean, and has a good customer inflow.  Decor: The store on the outside has a lovely dark granite (or something that looks like it, feel free to check yelp photos) entrance with pillars, and golden (colored) doors with statues to the side. In the inside there are small plants, and other side decorations depending on the season. There are color changing lights on the ceiling. There are 2 main main seating sections.   Service: It can depend on the server, but I would rate it 3.8. The servers are usually on task, but when it's busy or on slow Buisness hours they may refill your drinks/take your plates away slower. Overall the staff is nice, and if you need anything just be sure to ask.  (This isn't raining the hibachi staff, it changes/depends)   Food variety: The restaurant has a wide variety of seafood. (Some being very Asian/unique). Ex: Grilled Mackerel, Tilapia (bone in), Salmon, Crawfish, Octopus, Shrimp, and many others (they have boneless fish too). There also is a sushi bar (compared to another close by competitor \"Rivers\" (aka. [used to be] Tokyo) is made with higher quality ingredients (Doesn't fall apart as easily, and has good consistency). Though they may not have sashimi, they do have a good variety of flavors.  Ex: Fried tofu sushi (it kinda looks like a small boat), California rolls, etc (sushi is not my forte, personal opinion)   Don't worry they also have non-seafood options! Ex: Fried rice, Sesame chicken, hibachi chicken, Stir-fry veg+beef, Lo Mein (I think that's how it's spelled), etc. There are many others, but Hibachi! Hibachi= 3 different stir-fry flavors (teriyaki, hibachi, and something;there is a sign). Some of the thing you can get to have stir-fried is: (these aren't all, but most of them) -Raw: Beef, pork, shrimp -Uncooked: Noodles, etc  -Vegetables: Broccoli, Zucchini, Bean Sprouts, Onion,  -Etc: Pineapple, etc  They also have a soup section beside the Hibachi. They provide a large variety of fresh cooked soups, but there are some pre-made in the buffet. Ex; Egg Drop soup, others (I always get fresh cooked soup)  A few of the ingredients that they add with the (some varieties of) soup I dislike (tripe, etc), so just be sure to tell them clearly not to add it in. You also can choose what noodle you want. It is pretty much like pho, except you don't get a plate of vegetable on the side. They have a few unique styles of the soup: (some of these are special request) Duck, pho, udon, curry. (I'm pretty sure anyone can get curry, I usually get it.)  For kids there is Mac-n-cheese (I wouldn't say it's the best quality though), the seafood (shrimp) Alfredo is better. There are spring/egg rolls, fried shrimp, vegetables (broccoli w/ stir fried meats, green beans, etc), and a salad bar (probably gonna head to the dessert sections), Ice cream, sesame balls, regular/buffalo chicken wings, and etc.   Food Quality:  This varies so overall I rate it 4, it depends on what you get. Some foods are often not eaten like the Mac-n-cheese, so they aren't that fresh. While some foods run out as soon as they are put out (fried shrimp, sometimes crawfish). Some of the foods may have a too oily appeal on some, but not on others.  I usually get the green beans or some type of vegetable in all my plates, so it never gets to oily, and the soup (curry) can depend (sometimes to spicy, sometimes creamier than spicy; has coconut milk in it).   Overall, this is a great place & I would recommend this to my friends/coworkers/etc. I would go back & eat there, especially on cold days.   P.s: curry soup is a distinct taste, don't order it if you know you won't finish it. (Don't waste food, personal opinion). The main soup broth that they have isn't bad too, you can order it spicy."}
{"text":"No no nooooo. My kids wanted to go to a Chinese buffet and since I had a coupon (7$ off buffet w/ another paid buffet) we decided to go. Needless to say, I wish I would've read the reviews on Yelp FIRST. I mean, I do any other time..guess I was just too busy. Well, I regret it! A $28.28 bill down the drain. Mind you- as embarrassed as I am to say--NO TIP. Food was: cold, old and just not very good. Desserts: hard (instead of soft cake) and stale, old fruit and poor selections. The waitress just stood there and stared at us the entire time. She would come over and clear our plates in a timely manner- but that was about the extent of her job. I'm actually surprised they are still open for business. I will never come here again. Nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone. Save your money and go else where! One work: YUCK!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Great food selection for lunch.  Included Hibachi and sushi.  $9 for lunch is a bargain.  Service was attentive and fast.  The Hibachi grill, while a little slow, had much to offer.  Place could use a better desert selection but for $9 you really can't complain."}
{"text":"My husband wanted Chinese buffet but the only one with decent reviews was almost 10 miles away. Well that didn't stop him and here we were on our way to Chinese buffet. In another city maybe Saturday afternoon 10 miles is nothing but in Charlotte's traffic 10 miles seems like forever. By the time we got there I was so thankful it was buffet because I was very hungry. Well the place is huge, and the decoration is very interesting and I liked it. It was very busy and I saw a lot of Asian people which is a good sign. We didn't even sit I told our server water please and then ran to the food, They had a big selection of food, and all the trays were full and they seemed fresh. I had to be very careful while choosing what to eat because of my little one but it was easy with all the options they have. I was very satisfied and it is a Chinese buffet so lets keep real, the food was ok. But when you are hungry and you decide to go to a buffet then I don't expect great food. I just have to say that my husband love it but he loves food in general. He even made plans to take my dad there when he visit us from Nashville (those two are buffet lovers). So yes I will be back."}
{"text":"As I am not a sushi fan, I cannot attest to who is a good or bad employee when it comes to preparation.  My Dad dabbles a bit, and on one visit as he was at the sushi bar, he offered a tip to the preparer who then quickly pointed to which sushi he should get because it was \"the freshest.\"  Hmm...  I had lunch today because I had a coupon.  I always try never to be seated in the booths to the left of the buffet as you walk in as there is just too much employee foot traffic to negotiate.  Don't get me wrong, I like attentive service, but it was frustrating trying to get out of the booths and to the bar having to dodge the roving waitresses constantly up and down the aisle and, if not moving, firmly planting themselves in the aisle right where access from the buffet and booths are.  There was also little effort to move so customers could freely move about.  As far as the food, nothing exceptional stood out to me.  The \"house special\" chicken was alright once removing the skin which had a rubbery consistency.  The grilled shrimp were flavorless with no seasoning or grilled flavor making hot sauce or salt a necessity.  Other dishes were as expected with temperature being reasonable for a buffet.  What brings me back are their BBQ chicken wings which really should be labeled as hot wings for those not knowing they have some kick.  Not like wings you'd find at wing restaurants like BWW and a little small, but, hey, you can get as many as you want!  I ended my meal with some soft serve ice cream.  After circling the buffet a few times, I found my only options were to use a soup cup or have a cone as they had no dessert dishes.  Either they don't offer them or all were being washed.  The machine dispensed really fast, and all the cups were freshly washed (read this as still hot) so I luckily found a coffee saucer to put my cup under so I didn't drip all the way back to my seat.  Again, after nearly crawling over employees set up almost as obstacles to the customer, I had a few spoons of my now almost entirely melted serving in which I had little interest in trying to get another serving.  China Buffet is a little expensive for lunch even with a coupon.  I guess if I loved sushi this would be a great value.  I definitely will go again when I have a coupon but be firm in where I wish to be seated as the booths are just too big of a hassle when trying to get to the buffet and around the army of employees."}
{"text":"I gave this a four star because i'm blown away with the value here. The food is comparable to many. Except the buffet is ridiculously diverse .  Four types of shrimp.  Crab legs, your typical dishes plus some extras and desserts and ice cream and soup and  fresh sushi.    It's a nice buffet with buffet foods  I am from out of town and this would be $14 where in my home town.    Plus it was clean :)"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars but stopped going because the staff all changed and they just don't care. Waited a few years and after checking their health department report decided to try it again. It's even worse now! We tried 3 times and every time half the meat you get is refrigerator cold not even room temp. Even veggies are cold.  You can see steam coming off the table so why isn't the meat hot?? They don't care either there's steam so what's the problem...they need thermometers to check their food temps! Someone dropped shrimp in the sweet and sour sauce I don't trust that they actually dumped it they probably just picked the shrimp out . Well that was the last $50 we waste there."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. Paid $9 for a quart of rice and onions with 6 or 7 pieces of shrimp!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a great variety for a reasonable price. I love the sushi! Always fresh. My favorites are the sushi, noodles soup and crabs. I think it is a great price for the options they have."}
{"text":"By far my most favorite place to go to get a buffet!   The sushi is always amazing and so many different choices.   The buffet is always full and ranges from delicious general tsos chicken to pizza and chicken nuggets.   The hibachi is amazing you pick your own ingredients and sauce and they make it in front of you!   I've always enjoyed my food and service!!!!"}
{"text":"As mentioned by others, this place is on the pricey side - $9.00 for lunch.  And, for what you get, it is definitely overpriced.  Compared to other buffets around town, this one is just slightly below them - again, the price is a bit steep in comparison.  As for the food, there is a rather large selection.  However, the food was kind of bland.  I am not sure which item caused it, but I had an odd metallic taste in my mouth afterwards.  I would recommend looking elsewhere.  If you want sushi for about the same price but at a better value, try Ru San's in Charlotte."}
{"text":"CHINA BUFFET Never in my life would I have imagined I would eat a chinese buffet in Charlotte, North Carolina, but here I am, visiting (future) family that really only likes to eat Asian food. How does China Buffet compare to other Chinese buffets in CA? Honestly, it wasn't too bad. Decor-wise, it trumps anything in CA: the decorations are spectacular, as the entire establishment is adorned with giant Chinese wood-cuttings, banners, and paintings. Even the table tops are Chinese paintings! Food-wise, it's comparable to those in CA. The salt/pepper frog legs were the clear winners, as the batter wasn't too fried, and it just salty enough. There were many octopus entrees and fish to eat, which is pretty cool. They even have a hibachi bar, where you choose your own toppings and they stir-fry it for you. As for noodle soups, choose from Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, or Japanese-style. Better yet, they give you scallops in your noodle dishes! Desserts: just stick to the ice cream. Everything else is so-so. Seems like a popular spot for birthday parties, as we could hear many celebrations during dinner. Chinese buffets in North Carolina? It's passable. Nothing crazy, but not as bad as I would have expected..."}
{"text":"Dining in is a good experience. While being on the pricey side, they have more variety than most Chinese buffets and the building has undergone a beautiful, and probably expensive renovation. They would get 4 stars if it weren't for a screw-up that tainted my view of them. A coworker and I ordered carryout and they gave me/charged me for a completely different item, giving me white rice instead of fried and no spring roll which came with the dish I ordered. I said the number of the item I ordered, not the dish, so the screw-up was solely on the cashier's end. She offered no apology, no discount (even though the item I was charged for and given was a dollar more expensive than what I ordered) and simply said \"is the white rice we already gave you okay?\" when I inquired about the fried rice I'd ordered. So on the service end, this place is lacking. I will continue going here for the buffet, but will surely never order carryout from here again."}
{"text":"The food is getting worse and the one skinny Asian woman whom I've labeled miniSkirt Skeletor keeps upping the game on the trashy trashy clothing. The other obviously illegal help seem to know only how to constantly take your plate regardless of what's on it. It's a bi-monthly thing I do cause kids like this sorta thing but, seriously Skeletor, lay off the skirts..."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The food is so good and really fresh.  All you can eat sushi.  Lots of variety and plenty room for seating."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be good. I don't know what happened but when my wife and I went there today for dinner it was horrible. The beef in the beef and broccoli had the same texture as a rubber ball. All of the chicken from the sesame to the garlic to the scallion, was all super dry yet soggy with sauce at the same time. Even my water was missing the lemon that I asked for. The best thing that they had going for them was the wonton soup. Overall we will not be going back here again and would never recommend it to anybody else."}
{"text":"One of the bigger and better Chinese feed troughs in the area.  Like so many others, it's just a massive amount of average tastes.  The one thing you cannot question is the value proposition.  Go have lunch, and waddle back to the car."}
{"text":"The food is ok. The service is barely adequate. The decor is poor. The menu must always be the same, I was there once for lunch and another time for dinner and the only thing that was different at all was the price. Dinner is $2 more than the lunch and if it's a Friday or Saturday then it is $3 more."}
{"text":"I came her later afternoon and we were seated very quickly. The place was pretty busy and there is a large selection of food. However I don't eat meat and those options were limited. The food was horrible. Yes Chinese food is greasy and salty and I do like that about Chinese food but this was gross. The vegetable lo mien had absolutely no vegetables, it was all noodles. The spring rolls were practically empty. I must say though the service was good, they were very attentive but I will Never be going back. I'm sure I can find better Chinese food somewhere else here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My family has visited here a couple of times. Each time we have been here the food has been terrible. Everything is just above room temperature and it all tastes exactly the same. Is it just me, or are chinese food restaurants/buffets becoming all the same? The food items that were once breaded and fried were mushy-- well, for that matter, everything was mushy."}
{"text":"There are a lot of choices in the buffet from Chinese and Japanese food to American food. The taste though, is just plain not good. The food was either too dry, burnt, or to greasy. I will say though that there was plenty of fruit. I've never been to a Chinese restaurant with so much fruit.   There is plenty of seafood, not that good in taste our quality, but a vast selection. Seems like for a Chinese restaurant, there are mostly Hispanics working there, that might be the reason for the poor quality and taste.   The desert selection is almost nonexistent except for the ice cream options, which are self-serve, but so difficult to access that its not even worth trying.  The hostesses are lazy, they rarely moved from the drink area, there was one male host that actually did bring water and was pleasant.   13.00 for food that is not good. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! Sundays are the best days!! Crab legs, crab legs, crab legs!!! Yessss!!! (:"}
{"text":"It's a Chinese Buffet and I'm comparing it only to other Chinese buffets. It's one of the best I've been to.   The food was hot, fresh and delicious. The selection is great and always changing from visit to visit. The food is constantly being replenished. Take out is charged by the pound. They do have menus if you are so inclined. The seating area atmosphere was VERY nice, and the furnishings were well above any other buffet I've seen. Everything was clean! The service is great.   It is priced at $7.99 at lunch and $10.99 dinner per person for adults. There is an ample selection of hot, fresh food, as well as a Mongolian style buffet where you add ingredients for the chef to make you teriyaki, hibachi or garlic dishes while you watch. The sushi is always full and they are making in fresh right there. Don't compare it to your favorite sushi place... it's a buffet."}
{"text":"As many times as i've been here I can't believe I never wrote a review. The sushi is solid. Probably the best I've had in NC. They'll even give u sashimi if u ask & they give u nice sized slices too. Since I moved from this side of town I've been to a few buffets on E Independence & near the university area. Neither had better sushi than this one. The salt & pepper shrimp are also delicious but sometimes needs a little more salt. I come here for the shrimp & sushi. As a matter of fact, I think I'm going to take the drive over there today. Its only 20 miles & I need my sushi fix!"}
{"text":"This is a regular place for my mom and me whenever I'm visiting her. To me, it's just like any other chinese buffet joint. One of the waitresses knows us and is always friendly. We've never had issues with service. My hubby refuses to go back though. He must've ate some bad seafood or something, because he ralphed in the bathroom when we were gonna leave. He always eats that strange, grody stuff like the octopus and whatnot."}
{"text":"SUSHI SUSHI SUSHI Anywhere else I go to have sushi, I compare it to China Buffets and it NEVER equals the amazingness. I wish I was educated in the names of what the sushi rolls were called but I'm not. lol. Let me just tell y'all, that fried sushi will make you smack your mama. Ask them to make it fresh and it's literally a mouthgasm. (Haha gross but true) We love \"our sushi guy\" as well. He always greets me so nicely and makes me feel comfortable and happy. The buffet is awesome too, it has its good and so so days like alot of places but I never turn down the opportunity to go here. Definitely a go to if you want sushi and great Chinese food."}
{"text":"i enjoyed almost everything here except the seafood combination tray tasted like it was bad,it even smelled bad.The rest of the buffet was average for a super buffet.I liked the won ton soup it was better than most places but it was the only thing that stood out.I was kind of leery about all the food after i had that bad shrimp.I told the hostess about the dish and she told me they were fine and even ate one.They smelled like dirty socks and i love shrimp i know what they should smell and taste like.I hope i dont get the shits later.If it had not been for that dish they would have gotten 3 stars."}
{"text":"For a Chinese buffet, this place is as pretty good as it gets.  China Buffet just opened on Independence Blvd where an old Olive Garden used to be.  It can be a little tricky to get to, but it's worth the stop.  They've made some HUGE improvements inside and out, giving it a beautiful, modern appearance.  The restaurant was very clean inside, and a lot of details were put into the decor and dining rooms.  The most imaginative is the entrance to the restaurant where it looks/feels like you're standing underneath a starlit evening sky.  The doorway leading into the restaurant rivals PF Chang's as well.  The food offerings were pretty extensive and flavorful.  I sampled several items and nowhere near tried even a quarter of the items on the multiple buffet tables.  There's something for everyone, including kids who may be fussy about foods.  The sushi offerings were greater than most Chinese buffets; there were more unique offerings than the traditional California roll.  And I didn't even get to touch the big salad bar or the made-to-order Hibachi option!    The price was pretty reasonable for dinner, too, considering all of the items that China Buffet had to offer.  Everything was great, and it's probably the only Chinese buffet in the Charlotte area I'd consider in the future."}
{"text":"China Buffet is a new Chinese buffet restaurant (duh) in the University area.  For me, it fills a void that was left when Chen's Bistro buffet closed a few months ago in the same general vicinity.  Despite the uninspiring restaurant name, the interior of China Buffet is much nicer than most Chinese buffets.  Most amazing are the entrance with its huge copper doors (which could rival PF Chang's entrances) and host stand area with the oval blue sky and twinkling lights on the ceiling.   There are about 10-12 bars of hot and cold foods, plus a Mongolian BBQ area where a chef will cook up your selected meats, veggies, etc. fresh for you, a sushi bar, and a dessert bar with pastries and ice cream.  The food is all good, but nothing really stands out as truly exceptional.  For true sushi eaters, the sushi is just \"meh.\"  It's all very filling, though.  There are a lot of foods here for kids and other picky eaters, too.  The prices are very reasonable -- $8 for lunch and about $10 for dinner.    The buffet area and dining room are all very clean, although the dining room could use a few more separating walls for ambiance.  The decor is all really nice, though, and you can tell that they put a lot of money into the restaurant.    We'll definitely be going back occasionally on those really hungry lunch days."}
{"text":"What can i say its a Chinese buffet the prices are amazing at 4.99 for lunch and you can't beat that for a buffet.  Service is good, food is mediocre and not all is fresh pizza looked dry and not sure how old mac n cheese tasted like noodles and water.  The firey chicken, egg rolls, pepper steak, and other assorted chinese dishes were good. Worth the money for what you get i would take it over any fast food place any day."}
{"text":"GREAT BUFFET SUSHI. Bring 5$, tip the sushi maker and they will make any roll you want. They have got rolls, cold rolls, speciality and they all are great. They Buffett food is average but still good and the ice cream machine doesn't always work. The staff is friendly and nice. I recommend this place to anyone that wants all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"Anything I say about China Buffet should be tempered by the fact that the lunch buffet is $6.80, after tax.  The prices go up on Sunday for the church crowd.  While I'm sure it's possible to find a cheaper buffet, I have yet to do so.  The food is generally hot, and the spread includes a decent selection:  standard Chinese buffet fare (generally, entrees like General Tso's Chicken, Beef & Brocolli, and Egg Foo Young, soups, some sushi, egg rolls, and crab rangoon) as well as a few oddities like onion rings and shrimp cocktails.  I have never gotten food poisoning from China Buffet, and never seen it closed by the health department.  Therefore, given the price, it's a bargain.  The only downside:  I have yet to eat at China Buffet without being stricken by a food coma of epic proportions that leaves me incapacitated for most of the rest of the day."}
{"text":"It's edible and for the price it's doable. The kitchen bought out small batches of food so it was hot and fresh. The sushi buffet put out the odd pieces of fish for sashimi consumption which was great for carb restriction diets.  I would have given the restaurant 2 stars, until a bug ran across my foot. I looked under the table and there was a roach that I stepped on and killed. A white bug that looked like a maggot escaped me. I informed the manager and she said they just sprayed. Sheesh. The carpet needs to be removed and the floors and furniture a good scrubbing."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant. We had been craving a good Chinese buffet for a month and finally one night decided to try China buffet. We go in and get seated. Order drinks and my husband gets his cup and says \"it's soaked on the outside.\" Wipes it down and sees it's cracked all the way down the side.   Food... it was not good.Hands down one of the worst Chinese restaurants I have ever been to. Nasty noodles, every kind of chicken i tried was all breading and little chicken and extremely dry! Crab Rangoon wonton was missing the crab Rangoon lol just wonton wrappers. Cold green beans. Several items my husband ate, he spit out. Sushi is made in house. My only concern with it was how old the raw fish was based on the color of the salmon and how awkward it was for the sushi chef to just stand there and watch you lol.   For 14$ per person it was absolutely not worth it. Not even the slightest. We should of asked for our money back after we let the waitress take our full plates away. We will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is next-door to our hotel - and since our hotel doesn't include breakfast and we slept late today, we ate lunch (brunch) at China Buffet.  We're incredulous about the negative reviews, since our experience was quite the opposite.  Firstly, everything was very clean and the food was quite fresh.  Secondly, the selection of food was *terrific*; really impressive when compared to other Chinese buffets - and it included a big variety of sushi, too.  Thirdly; everyone working there was *very* pleasant, plus our server (i.e., he brought & refilled our water glasses and he cleared our plates between visits to the buffet) was *very* attentive.  In addition, the interior of the restaurant is very attractive and spacious.  (Update on 4/14/14):  We also ate lunch (brunch) there today and it was another very positive experience.  The cost is much less on weekdays ($8.99 vs. $12.99, although even $12.99 is a bargain for the amount of delicious food).  The hostess recognized us, and she & our server were very sweet."}
{"text":"I give this five stars because of the cleanliness and selection.... Lots of food and it was all fresh and delicious. Compared to other Chinese buffets this is definitely one of the better ones.... I recommend it... Staff was friendly as well so all around good choice"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm not much of a buffet person. I've always found them not quite clean enough...way too many kids messing with the food....so so good. But a friend had coupons and treated me for my bday.  I have to admit I was impressed with the cleanliness and definitely the food. Everything was good. The staff never let the food get too low before they filled up more. I had mostly seafood. The crawfish (in the shell) was tasty. I've never had it fresh like that. It's messy but fun to eat. The bourbon chicken was very tasty. The soft shell crab was okay. But I blame myself. I was so determined to get the little pieces of meat out of the crawfish, by the time I got to the crab, I didn't feel like messing with more shells. The soups and hibachi grill looked good but I didn't try. That'll be next time.  I got take out from the buffet and they charge by the pound.  4.99/lb. I found it very cheap considering how much I got. They have dessert also. Cookies, cake and ice cream. My only complaint with the ice cream was the scoopers were all in a faucet with running water to keep them \"clean\" I guess.  I know there probably isn't any other way to keep them clean if it's self serving but I was a tad grossed out. I saw remnants of ice cream in the faucet.  Other than that, I really liked the place and will go back."}
{"text":"This place is always serving hot fresh food. Lunch is only $4.50 and dinner is only $7.00 All You Can Eat! They have crab legs and all the different types of carry out us Americans love! They have a small SUSHI selection too! The only bad deal is the desserts are NOT that great and the place would benefit with a salad bar... but it is the best verity of Chinese food I have ever scene. You can also carry out your choice of picking by paying per pound.  Sushi rolls are 6pc. for $2.50!!! The Tuna Vegi Roll Rocks!"}
{"text":"When here yesterday. Food was cold, slow in refilling the buffet and my sweat tea. Also not the same people working here as it use to be. Kinda sad. Used to come here weekly but no more"}
{"text":"I walked into the place, a bit stuffy and out dated decor but for a place somewhat in the middle of nowhere... what the heck can't be that bad I thought! So agree to 11.99 for a buffet plate.   I walk the food aisles horrified at over and under cooked food lined the rows. I immediately opted for the hibachi though the ingredients were in lukewarm water (not ice), and the raw shrimp covered in a white liquid of some kind.   15 minutes later I gathered what I believed to be the remaining edible parts of this lack luster buffet. Unsurprisingly I was literally covering unbearable pieces in napkins every 2-3 bites. Disgusting.   I had barely taken a single bite of 8-9 items. And alerted the \"manager\" that the hibachi was drenched in peanut oil and how the rest of the food piece by piece wasn't cooked adequately.  After reviewing all of this for 10-15 minutes, she yells in another language (mandarin?), then she offered only to either weigh all the food on the table and I pay per pound and take it home... or pay the regular buffet price...   I, currently sitting at the point of irritated and vomiting, handed her the 12 dollars... she seemed much more consumed in 12 bucks than whether or not she had just given a Customer food poisoning.   Please AVOID this place, it's poor management, cleanliness, & awful taste ... altogether.   I assure you I did you a favor. Please keep your money."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible.  If you are in the mood for vegetable lo mein that is literally cabbage & onion lo mein then this is the place for you.  Sesame chicken was incredibly dry.  (How is a dish with sauce DRY??) Save your money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Food is always hot. Pretty consistent with flavors. Clean. Nice balance of umami.  Freindly courteous staff. Staff has never acted poorly towards my wife due to her disability that requires a special drinking device."}
{"text":"Like all buffets there are good items and there are bad. I find the sushi and the hot and sour soup to be consistent. The rest can be hit or miss, but of all the choices  in Surprise this one is probably the better option. The crab legs have been hit or miss. The last time I has them they were cold and tasteless. This time they were still cold, in spite of them just coming from the kitchen. But at least they has some taste.  So I guess go for the Asian food and don't count on the crab."}
{"text":"Maybe I will update this. Twenty mins to close but was told that the kitchen was closed. Not going for it. Asked for the manager and would you believe that the manager is in China ? Asked who was running the store and would you believe that I miraculously got my order taken. Will let you know what happens."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here you would think restaurants were based off selection and not food quality.  This is a typical chinese buffet/mongolian grill with sushi selections.  Lots of variety and all of it is pretty terrible. Many dishes were luke warm, sushi was gummy, tables were close together and clientele was very low end with lots of kids running around.   If anyone tries to tell you the food is good then just go and try the general tsos chicken.  Go ahead, cut it up.  How much meat is in there and how much of that meat is white?    You are NUTS if you aren't going to Fuse Buffett instead....but if you have kids you are going to let loose then stay at china buffet!"}
{"text":"First off, we come here often and have enjoyed eating here for the most part, but now I'm not so sure we will be back.. We ate here tonight and all of the food was pretty decent, but one of us got food poisoning from the raw salmon and/or raw tuna..  We really look forward to the sushi buffet, but after tonight, never again!   Update: Two days later and still violently ill from the seafood from this place!"}
{"text":"This is my all time FAVORITE place to eat. 2 people can eat for what one person eats for elsewhere. All you can eat Shrimp, Beef, Pizza, Salmon, and Sushi for less money than most fast food. I eat here at least 3 times a week."}
{"text":"As another reviewer noted, mid last year this place, now known as \"KING CHINA BUFFET\" changed hands.  The original staff still works at the Eastlake location (which I have also reviewed) and the new buffet right down the street from this one.  I have not been to it since it changed hands, but from what I have been told, it is absolutely terrible.  Please don't let my original review influence you into choosing this out of the other options.  The better buffet isn't more than a block away."}
{"text":"We started frequenting this buffet after we found out that it was owned by the same people (or family of) that owned our favorite buffet in Mentor on the Lake, but also served alcohol.  As of the recent change in ownership, this is the only one of the two we frequent.  The price is right, the food is generally better than what you'd expect from a Chinese buffet, their drinks are affordable, and the sushi is AWESOME!    Long story short, if you want to get the most for your money in Lake County, this is the place.  If you liked the MoL buffet before the ownership change, try here.  If you want to stuff yourself on General Tso's and sushi and still have enough in your pocket to hit DTW afterwards, this is the place!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!! The food was cold and not very tasty. The place had just opened so the food should have been piping hot. I think the food was leftovers from the day before.  I hope my friend and I don't get sick.  When we complained to the manager she acted like she didn't believe us and only gave us $2.50 off so a  horrible lunch cost us twenty bucks.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Do not go there for the sushi! It's probably been sitting there for hours and God only knows where the fish came from. The staff is very nice but the food is horrible!"}
{"text":"Been visiting this place for quite a while.  My family of six love it. Over the last few years they have only improved in our eyes. We will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"Heavenly sushi! Always the best sushi for the price! Who could argue with  all you can eat sushi? The hibatchi grill is wonderful and vegetables are always FRESH!  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Always cold.  It used to be our favorite place because of the great selection.  But last two visits the food was cold."}
{"text":"The only reason I added an extra star was because our waiter was great. The food was okay, there was definitely a great selection. Everything was super greasy and I found a hair in my spring roll. I would go back if it was maybe my only option for the area but the hair definitely made me lose my appetite really fast."}
{"text":"I have been going to get take out from China Buffet once or twice a month & have enjoyed it greatly. It was kind of like my monthly treat meal.  UNTIL ONE DAY... I got a rare Friday off and I decided to fill it with a bike ride, drinks & China Buffet. The day was lovely and dare I say one of the best days of my life. Then when I broke into my China Buffet take out the food was so awful it completely took away all of the joy that had filled my heart.   The Chicken was so rubbery it didn't even taste like meat from a animal that exists on this planet. All the sauces were watered down. Noodles & the rice tasted like styrofoam packing peanuts. WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD WITH FOOD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.  Definitely ruined my entire day and that's saying something because my girlfriend totaled her car later on that night. But after I explained what China Buffet did to me she said, \"I'm so sorry this happened to you\"  I have not returned since then and I will not until a representative from China Buffet personally apologizes to me. Also I live just around the corner so I drive by China Buffet on a regular basis. And my hate runs so deep I curse directly at the building (a inanimate object) every time I drive pass."}
{"text":"I didn't find the Chinese buffet all that, but the sushi is the best around. For the buffet price you get a WIDE variance of fresh made sushi. No committment to anything. Just as much as your tummy holds. I was skeptical at first but I go there often now. I went to sushi 101 tonite n was missing the buffet  And the ice cream at the end."}
{"text":"Mother of a special needs child and quadruplets...At first my husband and I were very impressed. We have 5 children, 4 that are quadruplets (3 yrs old) and one of them is special needs. They placed us in a back corner where we were alone and then placed another large party in the back right by us. Everything was fine and going well. Near the end of our meal the larger party complained about us. I'm assuming it was due to my son screaming at times. He tends to do that when he gets excited and my husband and I have to try and re-direct him. It was pretty obvious and instead of being caring to our situation we were brought our check. I'm hoping that these god fearing people (talked about coming from church) read this and know that we are tourist and saw a nasty people side to Surprise, AZ that was uncalled for. I believe in karma and I also feel that have a right to eat out as well. We were paying customers also. I've never been more offended to be complained about and it's the first time it's ever happened. Shame on you for judging. The food was delicious and the waitress and hostess. We're incredible and kind, until we got complained upon. We also went early for dinner (5 PM) hoping we wouldn't cause any issues."}
{"text":"One o f my long time favorite places to eat when I'm in the Pineville area. This place has been here for many years and the consistency is dependable. Delicious food buffet style at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Not sure what people have against this place.  Its probably one of the best Chinese Buffet's I've gone to.  Large selection, good food, good service.  Their sushi bar is surprisingly good (and made fresh) and their newly expanded dessert bar is mighty tasty as well.  My coworker even goes there, get's everything you'd probably avoid at a buffet (seafood) and always lives to tell the tale.    Check the local paper and you can usually find a coupon or two."}
{"text":"If you have not been to China Buffet lately...please take a good look at the pic of the sushi bar that I took tonight...those that know Tom and I ....know that we are very picky about our sushi...the sushi chef is gaining much needed experience and tonight he was at the top of his game!!! Everything we tried was both fresh and full of flavors...time for those of you that enjoy good sushi to head back for an enjoyable experience"}
{"text":"Food quality was pretty bad and even the pop was flat. Shortly after eating, and the next day I had stomach problems. Would not recommend this place. Definitely not worth the price or your health."}
{"text":"Very large buffet. They have sushi, too, I even ate a whole squid thingy. Not bad. You can definitely find SOMETHING you like there. And a plus, they have mee fun, which I find very rarely at a Chinese place. Mostly they have lo mein or something."}
{"text":"Where is it written that Chinese food doesn't have to taste like Chinese food at 4pm??? The 1st time I came here was a few weeks ago & the food & service were very very good: borderline excellent. Today though......not so much.  The food: out of 40 hot dishes on the buffet only approximately 4 were hot & fresh....everything else was from mid lunch rush or earlier. In the steak pie (which was a ground beef jamaican pocket) I tasted what really tasted like bleach....No bueno!!!! The crab rangoon (one of my faves) was horrible & the fried rice tasted like fried rice from 3 days ago that had been over - nuked in a microwave.....3 days ago!!!  The service: our waitress served my fiancé half decaf half hot water & called it coffee....poor thing didn't realize my lady is a coffee savant! She also brought her \"creamer\" (milk) in a saucer. My fiancé has an awesome kitty, but she is NOT a cat!!!! Lady claims they were out of regular coffee....No your lazy ass just didn't want to make a fresh pot!  Overall.....I would have to say that I won't be back...."}
{"text":"i have been many buffets different states . cuz i am driving a lot  and i like to eat good food .  what can i say about this buffet ? its a little expensive then others . we paid 13$each except drinks .but the food is really good . so i don't regret . i think this is the best buffet i ever been . we had good time here . so clean inside !!!  customer service is good . the asian guy who served us was very polite. 5 star for this buffet . highly recommending ."}
{"text":"Great sushi ! Not so great waitress staff . Mostly cold expressions and unfriendly  attitudes . The sushi chefs are great ! Very friendly and always accommodating.  This is a great place to eat if you know how to pick and choose food - otherwise you may be very disappointed - soup is good - fruit is good and all you can eat sushi for 10.00 is definitely worth it - don't count on waitress to factor into the experience...You'll do fine . They will stand in your way- step out in front of you - and overall just stare like you are their enemy until time for the check, at which time they will quickly find time to get to you.  Two thumbs up on sushi and sushi chef  but two thumbs down on waitstaff"}
{"text":"The food was alright, BUT NO PORK at this place! Only in the egg rolls! Lady says they don't serve pork because,  wait, wait, because the MUSLIMS don't like it! Wow! This is America we eat what we want! I want sweet and sour PORK! Unfortunately ill never go here  again! I want pork, beef and seafood! I don't eat chicken! Remove it from your menu!"}
{"text":"I really don't do Chinese, so a Chinese buffet is really pushing it for me but my inlaws really love coming here when they visit and I don't even know how they found this place because I never noticed it until they found it a few years ago and have been going ever since.  Anyway, I will say that this place stays packed and is really not that bad.  They have lots to choose from.... fruit/salad, noodle/rice dishes, seafood, several meats including salmon, chicken, pork, beef, veggies, plus dessert station, sushi station, hibachi made to order station and soup/pho station, the choices are never ending for a great price.  I would say my favorites are the sushi station, the made to order pho station, and the made to order hibachi."}
{"text":"The Sushi is fresh and really good! Pork Fried Rice, Fried Fish, Fried Shrimp, General Tsos, and Sesame Chicken is what I have had and it's all good. Very affordable prices too! It's my new go to place! I enjoy the to go take out."}
{"text":"I go here often.  It's a little hard to get to if you don't know the cut threw street. The decor makes you feel like your not about to go into a buffet. They have a lot of waiters or whatever you call people that refill your drinks.  The hibachi grill is nice. They also make soups, they're delicious. I really like the duck soup. So it is not just a buffet, but you do have to get up and order your food. I've had better buffet bar food.  There's also a sushi chef to take custom orders. I give it a 4 because if the value if your into that kinda thing."}
{"text":"Best Chinese buffet in charlotte. Great variety, fresh hibachi grill option and pretty decent sushi assortment. I dig it. Price is average for buffets but it's legit. Definitely will be visiting again."}
{"text":"First time here with my son. The food is good, a little sweet. He loves the sushi - all of it seems fresh. Staff has been attentive and friendly. Price is right for dinner time. No complaints!"}
{"text":"WE have eaten here a few times for dinner.  The food has become better since the new ownership.  I like the egg fu young sauce. We were here last month and they were out of the sauce:(  There are many good choices and the food is fresh. My favorites: crab rangoon, egg rolls, chicken, wonton soup.  The price is right and we plan to go here for lunch in the near future. On the downside:  The Hostess in the mini-skirt is not dressed professional and each time we're here we try to guess her age.  On the downside: the employees barely speak English and my guy left his work SmartPhone and we tried to speak with a Manager and we didn't get any help when this place was under old Owners."}
{"text":"China Buffet is a gorgeously appointed restaurant; almost too nice to be a buffet. I really wanted to take home the dining chairs. The Dining area was a bit to brightly lit for my tastes. The buffet itself is huge and so typical of the generic American/Chinese buffet standards. My initial reaction was that there was nothing I wanted to eat. Tons of American junk food, sushi made with surimi, basic Chinese dishes you see everywhere. A salad bar with some great looking mixed greens but nothing but pickles to put on it.  The usual Hibachi grill. Upon further investigation I found some steamed clams with a nice gingery sauce that was worth eating. Then I discovered the baby octopus! They look like little tiny - oh never mind - and were cooked with jalapenos. Tender and spicy, one of the best dishes I've ever had on a Chinese buffet. I ate the whole vat. Would definitely come back for the baby octopus, but with my luck they wouldn't have it that day."}
{"text":"I am a regular of the China Buffet & the food here is great (for a buffet) with a very nice selection. The staff is attentive & friendly and most of the food is warm & they never run out of any given dishes. Trust me, I would not keep coming back if it was not worth the money."}
{"text":"If you want gourmet type food & service this ain't it. If you want good food @ a great price with modest surroundings THIS IS IT! I eat here often and have never had a bad experience. Love the food it's fresh and well flavored. I don't know how they can charge so little for their buffet. I'm a Senior - they always give me a Senior discount which really helps. The place including the restrooms are always clean. My favorites are: Walnut Shrimp, Crab Legs, Mongolian Beef, & Seafood Casserole Try it you won't be sorry.."}
{"text":"We were looking up different Chinese/American buffets in the area awhile back and came across this place.   This is our 4th time eating here and a first for dinner. We really enjoy this place. It's definitely worth the price you pay for. And service is great for being really busy after 7 PM.  The buffet is good, the soup is good, and the Sushi is fantastic.   Definitely recommended if you're in the area."}
{"text":"China buffet is the best in the west valley! Great selection, always fresh. Price is average. I order off the menu and the guy knows me when I walk in :) The family eats the buffet and always go back for 2nd and 3rds! My kids love the ice cream at the end lol. All the staff is always friendly. My husband was craving the eel sushi and the sushi man made it fresh just.for him! Don't waste your time anywhere else. This place is the best!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely filthy. We were here last year and we decided never to go back but we thought we'd give it another try. Went for dinner tonight and was disgusted. There was old dried up rice under the tables against the wall just piled up. Wet napkins were wedged under our booth seats. Under the buffet lights, you can see splatter of food from the last decade. While I was eating, a waitress emptied plates into some bus boy buckets and some fell on the floor and she kicked it under the cart! Tons of garbage and food under these carts. Blech!! Then all the food was cold and hard. Bathroom was a hellhole. No idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way."}
{"text":"So bad, I'm sitting in this restaurant furious that food this horrible is even allowed to be made. Horrible service and horrible food. The only semi-nice part about it is the appearance.  The food was cold and looked like it had probably been out for hours. The food that we did eat was soggy and bland. We've lost our appetite after trying the first plate."}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences here over the past year. Most of the time I am pretty pleased, but I have gone at off times and thought the food was not up to par. Overall, they have a good selection of items, and most of the time it's amazing. The buffet is kept well stocked, although sometimes when I go at busy times I do have to wait for some items. Customer service is good- never had a problem with that. Definitely some good people watching at times... it is a buffet after all!"}
{"text":"So i read the reviews and went anyway.  But, if I could rent a time machine I'd 1) Kill hitler and 2) go back in time and tell myself to not go to this restaurant.  It is an experience that I wish I could erase.    Everything tastes like limp soap.  The sushi is ok (but if you're dropping 12.99 for Sushi you could do better somewhere else).  The hibachi bar was promising, but the meat on the bar is frozen and meat that goes from frozen to cooked tastes horrible.  I literally had nothing there that I enjoyed and it made me feel horrible.  Don't go.  It's easy to read reviews and go, 'Ill take the chance.'  but I promise, it'll have you wishing for a time machine."}
{"text":"Wow where do I start with this one their food is not very good they only thing that tasted pretty good & tasted fresh was the potatoes don't care for this place at all"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese buffet i ever had .I went at dinner time not even a single dish is fresh and chicken is hard to chew .Plates and spoons are not cleaned properly ."}
{"text":"It's good, but not great. Definitely not a cheap meal, if you splurge and order a tea or soft drink, you are looking at $12 for lunch.   The hibachi is popular, I didn't see many lining up for sushi. The buffet is a different story. I like the way the tables are laid out, even when they are crowded, there is enough room to walk around the tables.   So what's good? If you like chicken, the fajita is really good. The fried wings are good too, the drumettes are meaty and tasty. The s&p calamari is good if you get them fresh from the kitchen. I don't eat rice, but they have several to choose from. The selection on the weekend was different than what I saw on a weekday, and the meal was $2 more on Saturday. Otherwise, looked like the standard Chinese buffet offerings. If you can pack the food away (not in a doggy bag lol), probably a good choice if you are in the University area."}
{"text":"Awesome food! We've come here for about 8 years now. Always good and fresh. Mushrooms and bean sprouts are great and hot and sour soup is the bomb. Good for both lunch and dinner.  Military discount accepted."}
{"text":"After realizing that Tin Tin is a steep $23/person for dinner on a weeknight, China Buffet was our next choice for a friend's birthday dinner. For $12/person, you can't beat this place! Pretty standard Chinese buffet food, but it was tasty! I especially liked the lo mein and teriyaki chicken. I will be back, especially for the to-go option (4.99/lb for lunch, 5.99/lb for dinner)!"}
{"text":"Best buffet!!!! Crab legs huge never seen in buffets that size like weapons!!!! Huge sea food selection! Clean! Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but man this place is just not good. The food is horrible and I wouldn't be surprised to see several health violations if I went into the kitchen. The floors are stained and I mean not just a little. They are everywhere. The staff was nice enough. Let's not forget to mention about 30 min after I ate I lost it. Ya I know gross. I didn't even eat that that much. I tried the spring rolls and I couldn't tell you what was in them. I had maybe 2 bites of the chicken skewer things they had and it was just weird. I ended up eating a plate of honeydew melon. It was the most expensive  honeydew melon ever at $10+ a person. I'm sorry but please save yourself and your stomach and avoid this place at all cost!!!!!"}
{"text":"Like others have said, the sushi is good. There was not one beef dish to be found, no chicken wings, (just big drumsticks, which I don't like,) the spicy dishes weren't spicy, and there weren't even any crispy noodles for your soup. All that, and it was laid out in a weird way that had people bumping into each other, and it was uncomfortably warm inside. 25 dollars for two that I'll never see again. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was my second time to let them try and redeem theirselves.  But no luck the food was very bland both times"}
{"text":"The food was so mediocre that i had to beat my friends ass in the restaurant, steal his wallet and pay for it with his money"}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome service everytime I go. Lots of things on the menu even sushi. Fresh food."}
{"text":"Very good & Clean. Food was very fresh and always hot. The bathroom could use some attention because it wasn't clean but it wasn't dirty. Other than that. I'm in love!!"}
{"text":"One star. Only because that's as low as I can give.  Hibachi bar was out of steak. And when it finally got grilled, the chicken was half cooked. The buffet bar was dirty and probably about half of the dishes were empty. What was there was cold.  No refills on drinks.  I left this place hungrier than I was when I walked in.  I will not be returning here and I do not recommend it to anyone.  There's a clean McDonald's across the street."}
{"text":"Much Better than Average  First ran across this place about 6 years ago when I was working in Concord and a couple of my co-workers recommended it to me.  I've eaten at many a Chinese Buffet over the years and this is one of the best.  They keep the steam tables turned so the food is fresh.  Food is very good and a great variety is offered.  For a buffet, not much you can say about service except they do a great job making sure the steam tables are current.  For the consumer, one of the best values in the area. Good food with a great variety, all you can eat and very pleasant staff.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"When wife and kids need a quick buffet fix this is it. Sushi is great ,soups are good , all the goodies you would expect, kid friendly, ice cream machines, all good ."}
{"text":"First I want to say that the food and service that my kids and I received was very good.  This was not the first time that we had been here either and food and service has been very good each time we visited.  I was not planning on eating out, but I looked on their website (not someone else's or another coupon site) and saw that they had a coupon for 2 adult buffet $4.00 with purchase of 2 adult drinks.  I showed the coupon to the waitress that sat us down and she nodded and smiled.  After we finished eating a different waiter brought our bill with no coupon used.  I showed him the coupon and he explained that it was a mistake and it should have said $4.00 off.  I explained with no avail that I had shown the coupon before getting any food and that if I had known that it was only $4.00 off I would not have chosen to eat there.  He was nice as he could be, but it doesn't change the fact that I thought I was going to spend $20.00 I ended up spending closer to $40.00."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner. The food was flavorless. The \"hibachi\" bar had raw meat sitting out. Very expensive for low quality food."}
{"text":"Cheap food fast is the best way to describe this place.  I understand the the concept of a buffet and you basically serve yourself.  But to be bombarded before you even sit down with questions from the servers is a bit irritating.  Like they already know what you are going to order, so there is really no need for a ton of questions.  The food is mediocre at best.  It's not gourmet for sure, but it will do.  Buffet size wise, it's a bit on the small side.  So you get the basic Chinese fare, but nothing extravagant.  You will get full here, but you may not feel all that great afterwards."}
{"text":"Crowed booths, gross inside.  The sushi was  scary looking.  Yes a lot of people was there but I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Huge buffet great selection, they do a lot of volume so turnover is high and food stays fresh.  Could have better sushi selection.  Mongolian grill also to get a custom plate.  For a buffet, it's excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing buffet!  We have been coming here for years.  My husband and I like to consider ourselves China buffet experts (how sad is that lol).  This is the cleanest, most consistent Chinese buffet we have been to in 20 years in Phoenix.  We always take relatives and people from out of town here.  The food is fresh.  They are always adding new items.  The sushi is much better than any other buffet.  They make you a great variety of rolls, and they don't skimp on the expensive ingredients.  On crab night they keep the crab legs coming! We have never gotten sick, and we have never had any gross out issues here.  The staff is friendly, and over the years they have gotten to recognizing us and our 4 teens when we walk in.  We are customers for life!"}
{"text":"very good food and plenty of choices.  the most important thing is the price  !  very affordable!  the only thing i dont like is the traffic on independence blvd!"}
{"text":"Didn't feel like doing anything special for mothers day, so we went here.  I had been here plenty of times before and it was fine.  This time was a little different.  The sign on the front of the door said that there was a mother's day special.  The special was that you got to pay an extra $1 per person for mother's day.  There was no special dish or anything like that.  You just get to pay extra.  I think it's weird to charge extra and not even say happy mother's day."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time. The first time was lunch..it was very so so. This time I was thinking I will give it another try. I did the dinner buffet. It was ok for the price; but somehow all seafood & meat don't taste very fresh. I did like the stir fried green beans & the rice noodles. Actually most of the veggie is good, fresh & tasty. Other than that, not so much. I wish they would charge more so that they can give us more quality stuff. Won't go back there anytime soon !!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't fresh, feels like been cooked 2-3 days ago. Will not recommend to anyone. Owner is not friendly even!!!"}
{"text":"For a weekday dinner buffet at $10.99, I'd say you can't beat that! I'm a sucker for a good buffet once in a while, and although you definitely get what you pay for here, the place isn't too bad! You have your usual American/Chinese cuisine, but I was disappointed they didn't have oysters. The only thing worth negative mentioning is that they need cleaning staff (both on the buffet floor and restrooms) attending at all times. It gets a little dirty and messy FAST, and quick cleanliness in this type of business is extremely important.  All in all, if you're craving buffet food, I'd definitely give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Not worth it. Food is mediocre at best (2 stars) and has gotten progressively worse. During my last visit after three half-filled plates (not even close to being filled up) I was served the bill as a sign of 'you have eaten enough and we want you to go'. No goodbye on your way out (four visits, not one goodbye).   Time to say goodbye to China Buffet and seek out an alternative."}
{"text":"I would go here again in a pinch. The food was mediocre, and the service was okay - not that would expect a lot from a buffet staff.  They had a pretty good variety of things, but mostly not asian.  They had a lot of random items like french fries, some kind of pizza, and a bizarre combination of seafood and cheese.    The price was low, and the wait time was nil. So, when i needed to eat a bite and get out to go to bed it wasn't bad. It is near several hotels, which is why it made sense for me when I ate there.   I would not recommend the mussels as they added some mayonnaise-based sauce which really tainted them for me. I like mussels, just steamed and with a little butter."}
{"text":"We went here three more times for lunch and twice more for dinner, but I think that it's time to give up on this place.  They are running a 20% off sale on their already very low priced buffet; what they should do is raise prices and improve their food quality and food handling.  Sushi means cooked vinegared rice, but the rice that they use in theirs has no flavor at all and just falls apart as soon as you touch it.  When they bring out a new pan of food they dump the contents of the old tray on top of it so there is no way of telling how old some of the pieces are."}
{"text":"Took the family here for the $4.99 lunch today.  I am still getting over the fact that I just fed three adults for $19.05 including tax and tip. Everything that I tried was edible, reasonably fresh, and reasonably warm.  The serving area was kept clean.  Whether it was an enjoyable meal is a decision that I am still struggling with.  With the low cost comes the inescapable fact that all of the food is prepared with the lowest quality ingredients commercially available.  Nothing is particularly flavorful.  Within two hours of leaving you will have consumed three bottles of water as your body tries to flush all of the excess salt and MSG out of your system. The sushi would have been acceptable except that they don't use sushi rice and the pieces fall apart.  There were at least six chicken dishes, my wife liked the Sesame Chicken.  The hot salmon, mixed seafood, and cheesy fake crab were OK but I've had better. I didn't bother with any of the beef dishes.  They had green beans and brussel sprouts as stand alone vegetables which were not bad.  Some of the fruit was OK."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese buffet in Charlotte. You want pho... they got it. You want sushi... they got it. You want hibachi... they got it. I get takeout from here all the time. A little sushi, seaweed salad, rice noodles with shrimp and vegetable, and throw a few dumplings in there for less than $6! That's a good lunch! The already prepared dishes range in variety from blue crabs to pizzas. I tend to stick to fresh raw items like sushi and hibachi. Great place for big parties and the wifi is stable."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Thanksgiving lunch was awesome.  I don't come here nearly enough.  The sushi is amazing, and worth twice as much as the cost of the buffet."}
{"text":"Yet another buffet. Yet another mediocre meal. I think I see a recurring theme at buffets. They pour their money into design with things like statues, running water, or other trivial things to set the ambiance. Then, the food. Sure they have a nice variety of food, but what about the quality? I think there's a formula into opening Chinese buffets. You must be wondering, why do you go to these restaurants then? Good question, I think it's so I have a scale of what other restaurants can do.   This is another one of those Chinese buffets that follow the nice ol' formula that I've seen fail time and time again. Starting off, they do great, but after a while it just starts to be a let down. I had about one plate of food (if you read my reviews you know why) and well it was okay. Nothing special. Very mediocre.   They have sushi, hibachi grill (which is like Mongolian style, but they just use the hibachi grill... In that you pick what you want, hand it to the cook, they cook it, then you get it back), \"Chinese\" dishes, desserts, and some other frivolous things, pizza, Mac n cheese, etc.   Final thoughts: expect grand ambiance and design, and mediocre food. Hey, but for the price... It's a winner compared to other buffets. (12.99 on a Saturday night)"}
{"text":"This place is way better than Dragon Buffet. My only gripe is that they had peanut sesame balls instead of black bean sesame balls. Place is clean and offers a variety of options. Great service too! Definitely worth a stop for a quick Chinese fix."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here for the first time in about four years. We have been going to that other buffet on Reems because of the sushi and Mongolian barbecue but were grossed out for the last time. This place has changed a lot for the better. Really nice selection of edible entrees and sushi. Everything was hot and fresh on the night we went (Tues. 2\16). Veggies not overcooked, soup OK and egg rolls were um well, passable. They have a bean sprout dish that is really good. The sushi was fresh the night we were there but even though the raw oysters looked fresh, some nasty tasting green slime squirted out when I took a bite and I spit it out. Hepatitis served cold is worth avoiding. The egg foo yung and sesame chicken were good. I tried as many dishes as I could and was generally pleased. Oh yes. Good dumplings and sticky pork buns. The soups are OK and the wonton soup is well stocked with wontons. Not like that other place.  Great variety but sadly no spare ribs. The deserts looked good but I was too stuffed to try any. The servers were very congenial, and the bathrooms were clean. I did not feel sick when I got home which is a huge plus for any Chinese buffet. Aren't my standards high? I like this place and I will be back."}
{"text":"This place has excellent sushi.   My family and I go there every weekend.  The sushi chef will personally take care of any special requests you have.  My wife loves the Rainbow Roll and I get a Unagi Roll.    The sushi chef loves to mix it up with his own creations and always wants feedback.  They just put in a Hibachi Grill, I have tried it a couple times and it great.  The Chinese buffet is typical of any Chinese buffet style restaurant you will see, except, they keep the food fresh.  I have been there a dozen times and never had soggy, cold or \"old\" buffet items.  The staff is friendly and they have a 100% score!!!     I hope I see you there!"}
{"text":"SUSHI REVEW ONLY.  THE CHINESE BUFFET IS DECENT, ABOUT THE SAME AS EVER OTHER CHINESE BUFFET IN THE WORLD.........  My review is based on going to visit Tony the sushi dude for the past eight years.  Although, I know live an hour away, I make the trek to visit with him.  He has a new guy who is just as anxious to make you the perfect roll, his name is Daniel......  These are two really good and personable guys.  He has a second joint that is now on my radar, Akabana Asian Bistro.....  It is in Fort Mill.  :-(  Now I just need an excuse to go to Fort Mill........"}
{"text":"Solid high 3.    I would have given it a 4 had the Sushi chef been remotely friendly or even smiled.  Hell no!  It would have broken his face to smile.  Sushi   I have been there twice for lunch.  The lunch has a great variety of the standard sushi rolls and nigiri.  It was all tasty and fresh.   No complaints!  Chinese Buffett  Standard stuff on bar.  All very fresh and tasty  Hibachi Grill  Great selection of chicken, fish, shrimp, steak.  Looked great!  The place was full both times, which ensures the food is rotated and you will always get fresh food.  Overall, two great experiences!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I agree with Cher on this one.  I really liked this place.  The food was very tasty, and the staff was very friendly.  I moved from the area shortly after finding it, but I would probably stop back by if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"I think after being here numerous times, I should write a review. I am a fan, so the 4 Stars are apropos. My gf's 5 year old loves this place, and will ask to go everytime upon passing it. Let's face it, the Chinese buffet options in Phoenix suck, which is really unfortunate. I think the collective angst about this is being taken out on all of the Chinese buffets of the valley. That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.   For what it is, a chinese buffet in Phoenix, this is quality. This is the better Chinese buffet in Surprise. The other one is good too, but not great, just like this place.    Here's what I've come to expect from this place. The service is always great. The servers are friendly, and affable. But, the food is ALWAYS hit and miss. Something may be good one visit, and dull and flat on another. The fried rice, and lo mein are great examples. The rice may be great on one visit, oily, sort of greasy, and full of gristle the next. Seems like things lean towards \"greasy\" if they're not good.   I deplore the TV set to CNN, or whatever other news station they decide to put on. I'll go out of my way to not have to sit under, or near that thing.   We'll alternate between the 2, I'm sure, but until something significantly changes at the other place, we'll continue to dine here."}
{"text":"It's definitely not the worst I've ever had. Not a very large selection and those that are there are not refilled very fast. And forget about the sushi. Very poor. It has been a few years since I had been there, prices went up and quality way down, and most probably my last time. Just not worth it."}
{"text":"Be careful of what your charged. They put things on the lunch buffet with little cards that say dinner only. The same things that other buffets have for lunch, like crawfish. Pick one up and you're charged dinner price. And even if you don't they still try to charge dinner pricing. They tried twice on me. Don't  go. Food bland at best."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent place to fix that chinese food craving, this is it.  Not the best in selection, but does the job.  The food could taste better for the price you pay.  Which isn't that cheap.  Service was good.  The place is clean, which is a definite 1up in my book.  I'd come back and eat there.  Worth a sit in."}
{"text":"I like this place, for the most part. It's a nice quick--don't have to wait for it to cook--place to eat. For me, the food has been pretty consistent and I know what to expect.   There are a few dishes that they don't offer, which we used to drive all the way down to the Zen Buffet in Peoria to get, before it closed down. But now there is a new Chinese buffet that recently opened up on Grand Ave that offers what we're looking for, she we go there instead."}
{"text":"Such a nice buffet.  Really one of the few that really does have way more than you would expect.  Good sushi and hibachi experience for sure.  But the most unique feature to me was the soup bar and the desserts.  Mostly the soup.  You still have your typical soup section you normally see in Oriental buffets.  However, here you also have a specialty soup section with a cook who will pull ingredients out of containers and noodles that are cooking on strainers in water that he puts fresh in a bowl together.  Unfortunately, the special of the day, a duck-based soup, was completely eaten up by the time I came in, but there was a nice selection of options to choose from including whether I wanted it spicy or not.  It's a nice addition to the usual buffet selections that fits really well with the typical hibachi you find at some of the nicer buffets where you bring them fresh ingredients and they cook it on the grill for you while you wait.  Also the sushi was very flavorful, good quality \"buffet sushi\".  The fact that when I went they had more elaborate deserts like apple cobbler, which you don't typically find at most Asian buffets really means they might have a shot to appeal to a more wide variety of...your picky relatives.  You know the ones."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat. Haven't had a bad experience here yet. Lol!  Sushi chefs are very helpful and eager to please (thats top notch in my opinion). My daughter and I have been coming here since we moved to the Charlotte area.  I think they could use a little updating in dining area but still a pleasant place to eat."}
{"text":"Four stars. But, they're buffet stars, okay? If you're up for Chinese buffet, this is a good call. If you're looking for a nice sit down dinner, keep looking.   We're staying at the hotel across the street and didn't relish getting in the car again, so we walked over. Happy we did.   Again, four buffet stars. Three would be fine average buffet. No frills.   Here are the frills that earned an extra star.   Noodle soup station. Pick your noodle style, pick your ingredients, pick your broth. Not the best I've ever had (no duck broth) but good variety of meat and seafood and the fresh herbs really make you forget you're at a buffet.   There were hibachi (pick your ingredients and they cook it up) and sushi stations, but I didn't try them.   Variety. All the normal dishes, a bunch of American dishes (for kids, I guess) and then variety. A few dim sum items; some more soup, and then seafood.  My son had his first octopus, crayfish, and frog legs.   Like the restaurant on the moon, no atmosphere. It's a Sunday night and more loud kids than a Chuck E Cheese.  Not their fault, so no star deduction; but fair warning Yelpers, it won't be restful."}
{"text":"Please dont eat here! My family and I were staying at a hotel near this restaurant and decided to order from here. The chicken was very chewy like jerky, the rice was soggy, and to top it off it caused us all to get the runs. Save yourself- and your stomach- the trouble and go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"My friend and her Husband took me out for my birthday lunch and it was GOOD! Everything was yummy!! They had a noodle service where you ask the chef which number noodle you want and they'll prepare it within 5mins!!! They had such a variety of food from ribs, semi-tradition to seafood to sushi, mouthwatering. I had a plate of sushi-wow, pretty good and they tasted fresh. I ordered Spicy Beef Noodle, this was just tasty and hity spicy spot! :)  I enjoy the service, all the waitress were very attentive and the atmosphere was great. I'll be coming back again soon! :)"}
{"text":"Won't allow service animals , they are afraid a small service pug would gross out other customers I even offered to sit in the quite corner of restraunt  if it helped the situation. Oh well didn't get any food after a 40 min drive there then a 40 min drive back on an empty stomach. The guy did offer to go food but I lost my apatite."}
{"text":"We used to love this place. We haven't been to this place for quite a long time, months. It used to be my favorite place because they have variety of seafood. One night, my family ate there for dinner I was disgusted. I saw there kitchen when staff brought out some food. It was filty. My husband pointed out the light switchws and were just full of black dirt. Their floor needs some good scrubbing. I will never take my family there again nor will not recommend."}
{"text":"This one in Monroe is closed. I can see why. The manager always walked around as if he was mad you came in there."}
{"text":"Really good food and friendly people. Love their buffet, and the fortune cookies are always interesting. Lots of good food!"}
{"text":"They must be known for there sushi. Because there regular food is mall grade at best.  I do not eat sushi, however my husband does. He was impressed that the gentleman making the sushi offered to make him anything he wanted. They do have a good sushi selection.    But considering it is dead in here, I can't seem to figure out why there are so many crumbs on the carpets. Visibly can see 4 servers standing around talking wait for people to finish there plates. They need to be cleaning this dirty restaurant."}
{"text":"I completely understand this is a Chinese buffet and can't expect much.  However, even by these standards, this place performed poorly.  Two major themes that lead to this 1-star rating are: little rotation of food and flavor.  We were here for 1.5 hours after a long day of work and wanted to relax and catch up.  Pit time was prolonged because we were waiting for a number of items to be replenished.  Two different pans sat empty for an hour.  We gave up waiting on those.  Also, several items looked near empty and unappealing, yet they, too weren't replenished.  The flavor across the board was either too salty or not seasoned enough.  The only items perfectly cooked were the steamed rice and egg rolls (the latter likely being factory made).  I suggest you consider eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"First of all, the name of this place has changed to House Buffet, IIRC.  I had not visited this place for a couple of years, but decided to take my three kids to check it out.  They have changed the interior from my last visit, as well as having more dishes available.  They also have a sushi station where someone is actually making sushi instead of the four or so generic rolls they used to put out near the fruit.  In all honesty, the sushi isn't bad considering you're at a Chinese buffet.  Might have been the best part of our meal.  As with most buffets, you have to be selective.  For example, only try the General Tso's if it is fresh.  If it has sat for more than 15-20 minutes, best choose something else.  That said, there are a few things on the buffet that are guaranteed to be decent (chicken w/broccoli, for example) and decent appetizers/dim sum-type options.  I have to compliment the wait staff for their patience with my children, especially my 2 year-old.  They made sure to keep an eye out when I left the table, and even gave him a ball to play with (and take home)."}
{"text":"Standard Chinese buffet fare...decent selection of options.  General Tso's buffet rule #1 - don't get pieces you have to cut smaller, or you will see what you're eating.  Bland desserts, but for $5, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This buffet was prettt amazing and they had a soup bar and the shrimp soup i had was fanominal. It is tricky to get to it but its totally worth it. I would recommend it and also their habachi is prety great. It was lovely and the decoration was very nice. Ibwill surely go again."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh...lots of variety -- buffet, sushi and hibachi. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First off, the decor to this establishment is stunning. The wait staff did their job well, filling up drinks and removing plates from the table. The buffet features your standard food found in other Chinese buffets, chicken and beef dishes, a salad and desert bar, rice dishes, noodles, and sushi. There is even a Hibachi grill where you can have your food cooked to order. The buffet features American dishes such as pizza and macaroni and cheese as well. The food ranges from mediocre to decent. Some of the food I actually enjoyed, however some of the chicken dishes were bland and rubbery, probably due to being frozen. Another complaint is the choice of music, the restaurant plays modern radio music as we dined. I do not want to listen to Justin Bieber or Rap/Hip hop while I am eating. I suggest a more classical approach, or Chinese music, fitting of a CHINESE restaurant as it is more calming. Overall, this is one of the better Chinese buffets out there and for around $10 per person, you can fill up your stomach with passable food."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident when we were actually looking for another China buffet. For the most part the food is pretty good. However, one of the helpers dropped an entire container of thick tomato based food, most of which splashed onto my pants and shoes!  She was very apologetic and tried to help me wipe it off.  The stains, despite my efforts to go to the washroom and clean up, are still evident. My complaint with this restaurant is that management did nothing to try and even apologize for the accident. No compensation whatsoever. Very poor way to treat customers. We will not go back and will renew our efforts to find China City Super Buffet,  which was the restaurant we were looking for to begin with!"}
{"text":"This Chinese buffet has mostly standard fare but done quite well. Some of their sauces are a tad sweet, however. That usually indicates that the sauces are pre-made. They have more items than most Chinese buffets because they have four buffet tables plus sushi. They also have some items you don't usually see on the dinner buffet such as cheese baked mussels and fried crab clusters. They replenish the buffet often. You can tell that they take pride in making sure the food is fresh! The sushi is very good and they will make you any sushi you want. The service is fast and friendly. I'm rating it four stars instead of three stars because they keep the buffet fresh and the sushi is great. All in all it's a very good Chinese buffet in the Pineville area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to buffet place. The flavor of the crawfish here is best out of all buffets that I've gone to in the past. They're pretty busy during the weekend and holidays."}
{"text":"Great decor. Probably the best looking Chinese Buffet I've seen. Stick to the fresh items. The hibachi bar, soup and sushi. The other items have little flavor."}
{"text":"It has a great location but not too many 'hot items' on the Buffett meaning the portion is less & been on the buffet for a little longer. The food isn't bad, it's a buffet guys! One thing it needs to include for the kiddos is pizza.  Tidbit. If u don't wander over to the grill then u won't see the noodle soup there. Yes they have pho!! It's basic but fresh & good. Try it! Of course with Siracha sauce. I guess that's why we keep coming back. Buffett + pho, a combo"}
{"text":"I don't understand why people expect gourmet food at a 9$ per person buffet.  I really don't.  The food here is great.  It's not to die for, but it's good.  The sushi is always amazing though and is a recommendation for everyone to try, especially since it's included.  The hibatchi grill is good as well and I enjoyed the food.  My complaints are two. 1.  Please fix the bloody air conditioner already.  It's a frickin sauna in here most days and makes it really uncomfortable to eat here during the summer time, and since it's the south, that's half the year.   2.  The bathrooms.  That's all I'm going to say."}
{"text":"I have been to many Chinese restaurants in my life and this was by far the worst. I do not even care about the high price for lunch ($9). What I do care about is the fact that everything I ate (no seafood) was horrible. It all tasted funny and had a strange after taste. I was not alone, so it was not just me."}
{"text":"Very good a lot of choices, I would have given it 5 stars but our server was really nasty, rolled his eyes, yanked bill & credit card out of hand, first place in many years I have not left a tip, and I usually tip 20 to 25 percent, you loose in the end for being nasty.  We will go back but will ask for different server"}
{"text":"Chinese food in Cleveland, wasn't expecting much, just needed some kung pao anything, hot & sour soup, and white rice to cleanse my Asian pallet from all the meat & potatoes I consumed in the midwest.  Came across this place on Yelp, 4 stars, 10 reviews, $7 bucks, buffet. That's 3 out of 4 green lights (10 reviews is a little light, but it's Cleveland)  White rice, baked salmon, roast beef, chow mein, veg fried rice, egg rolls, BBQ pork, sauteed mushrooms, sushi, dessert, all the greasy American-Chinese food you can imagine.  Three plates later, I walked out of China Buffet with a brick in my stomach (insert happy face emoji)  It got the job done, I suppose it's a 4-star Clevelander. I would return if I ever visit Cleveland again, but definitely skip if this place was elsewhere."}
{"text":"I used to come here a few years ago when i was working in the area, the group would like to meet here for lunch occasionally.  I haven't been back in a while and a few weeks ago I was craving chinese food but I wanted variety, I decided to stop in and get a take-out box.    It's hard to gauge what to expect when anything is sold by the pound, a lot of things are sold by the pound but that doesn't necessarily mean they're good.  for example, Dog Food, Fertilizer, Nuts, Fruit, Candy, Gold Ingots, Seafood, Horse Hair, Cookies, Soap, Coffee, Turkey, Building Materials, Meat Products, Olives, Scrap Metal, Uranium and apparently Chinese Food.  I filled up a take-home box and didn't feel I was overstuffing the box or having any difficulty closing the box, but apparently this was 2.4 pounds of food and was over $10 for some cheap takeout.  I'm somewhat convinced they use MSG and ingredients that make the food literally heavier.  Not wanting to give up, a friend and I stopped by here last weekend to eat lunch and dined in. the items on the buffet aren't bad and scratch the itch.  But everything is mediocre as you would expect buffet food to be.  the 1 star comes from how the food made me sick that evening, and made me feel nauseous for most of the night.  I will most likely not be back."}
{"text":"This place was clean and had a great selection. Every item had a good, distinct flavor and I ate more than necessary. I've had great food in Seattle's international district so I'm pretty discriminating when it comes to food. This place did not disappoint. I'll return again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Just visited this place yesterday with co-workers for lunch.  I love sushi but not a fan of buffet sushi, so i did not try any at all.  But everything else I had was very delicious. I especially liked the pork potstickers and egg rolls.  All the trays were consistently full.  Good place for lunch and it was $11 for lunch and 1 drink."}
{"text":"Stay away from this nasty place where I s the Health Department?  How can they serve  this?The bathroom smelled like urine . The sushi was made 3 days ago. STAY Away enough msg to choke a horse."}
{"text":"the price is great for the variety of food.... Love the sushi bar in the back...."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch .. After deciding from all the others n yelp...  Where to begin... I should of left and turned around when I saw the hand written note on the door regarding coupons for the buffet...  But I  was craving a crab ragoon .  2nd as I turned to the main dining floor there was only 2 people eating during their lunch hour....   Now I  turned my attention to the food. I sampled just about everything on the menu that is usually pretty good and you can't mess up .crab ragoons a  wings General tous chicken..eggroll.  Wonton soup. Every single one of these dishes there was  something wrong with it either too soggy overcooked nasty feeling or just not a good product whatsoever. Now an hour later after eating I feel sick to my stomach.  the worst Chinese restaurants never been in my life definitely  a F . Save your money go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Absolute best price for quality sushi, and well worth the quick drive from Rock Hill. Tony is a fantastic sushi chef, and an extremely nice guy, to boot. He is definitely the reason my wife and I come back so often, but the variety and quality of the buffet is great, too."}
{"text":"While the food at this place is decent, the hostess needs to be a little more respectful when asked about the pay first, then eat policy. The hostess was rude  and stated if you don't want to eat here, then leave! To be fair,  the guest was a little loud because she was alarmed that they asked for $69 before offering a seat or a meal. However, the low rating is warranted because it is unacceptable to \"yell\" at customers that find your pay me first policy unusual and offensive."}
{"text":"China Buffett offers a nice selection of Asian and americanized cuisine.  The sushi was fresh and creatively presented.  The buffet was well maintained and constantly replenished.  Loved the salt and pepper blue crab  and prawn.  They also offer hibachi grill, which is included in the price of the buffet.  The decor is very upscale for a buffet and the staff very friendly and attentive.   I would definitely return for another meal."}
{"text":"I come here once and a while theyre dinner prices suck. I came here yesterday for dinner after running around. First off when i walk in the waitress greets me she goes 1 not hello very rude. She takes me to my table and asks me what id like to drink i said coke and went, and got my food. I come back after getting my food, and no drink she sees me doesnt go, and get it afterna few minutes i asked her for my drink and she didnt bring it right away. The waitresses there are not friendly it isnt clean i go there for a cheap meal. Im a paying customer id at least some friendly service i shouldnt have to go to the waitress and ask for my drink when i knew id still be charged for it. When i went for my second helping i sat back down she got everyones refills she takes my empty plate away doesnt ask if i would like a refill or anything she just stood in the corner. If you want an all you can eat place where its cheap for 5 bucks go, but not good prices as i said for dinner. My question is why do the swrvers look like they hate everyone who comes in there they are allnvery rude. I might go back tomorrow for lunch. It isnt clean their bathrooms are questionable. I miss hometown. Only good things is its local to home, and cheap all you can eat for linch rather than going to get fast food."}
{"text":"This was horrible!!!! Most of what we tried was cold, not even warm, cold! Nothing tasted good. The meats were very fatty. We explained our disappointment at the front and they only discounted my meal not my husbands. We will not ever go back !!!!"}
{"text":"We were out of town for the day.  Discovered this place on Yelp while leaving the Southpark Mall.  Immediately I viewed the pics patrons took on previous visits.  The decor was nice and selection was familiar with unique items.  I loved the whole sushi bar, fried rice w/ cabbage, coconut shrimp, beam sprouts, ragoons, etc.  Everything was flavorful and good quality.  The atmosphere is quiet yet you can hear the Asian music well.  Our lunch was under $20 if not mistaken.  I always wanted to find a good quality Chinese Buffet but seemed rare.  Can't wait to eat here upon visit Charlotte again.  I hope the location near University is as good since we are usually visiting that end of Charlotte.  Be careful finding this location as it's right off the freeway!"}
{"text":"I used to like coming here but now it seems like they don't keep the place very clean. It smells and the carpet is filthy. The food is mediocre and pretty boring. They might want to change up their menu every so often, add a few new dishes here and there and get their floors steam cleaned. It stinks in there."}
{"text":"Great prices, good service, decent selection. Nice place to go for a cheap, yummy meal."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior.  Really beautiful.  My kids were fascinated by the cork carvings within the glass dividers, and the statues at the entrance.  There was a fair selection, but my favorite was the hibachi.  I am not a big fan of buffets at all, but to me the hibachi makes all the difference.  You get the benefit of selecting exactly what you want, and also don't have your food sitting around in a steam tray.  They did seem to be regularly refilled, though, so I don't think that they were sitting around TOO long.  I'd return."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday during dinner time. The buffet had a good variety of selection but you would have expected more buffet lines bec of how huge the building looked from the outside to inside.  Food to me was not good and most of it looked like it was sat out there all day. The only thing I've enjoyed were the fried wings.  And sadly, all 4 of us that dined in had a very upset stomach and had to run to the bathroom later that night. Another bad part of this experience was as I was leaving the restaurant the hostess (that looked like she could be the owner of the restaurant) dashed right in front of me to greet the customers that walked in while I was holding my almost 2 month old baby! No apologies, just rude!"}
{"text":"We left halfway through our first plates. The place felt like a steam room and the food was really bad and old. Just no."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a delightful surprise!  Our small group of weary travelers loved everything about it- from the beautiful decor to the unbelievable array of delicious buffet foods (shrimp, crab, fish, pork, beef and chicken fixed in countless ways) As if there wasn't enough choices, you can pick out the raw ingredients and have them hibachi stir-fry it right in front of you.  My son and I loved the very fresh fruits, sushi and scads of fresh ice cream choices as well as other sumptuous deserts.  I've eaten at a number of Chinese buffets and this one far surpasses anything I've ever eaten.  Even the picky grandkids were on board! Too bad we live so far away!"}
{"text":"Just came from China buffet worst food I've ever tasted. The place is disgusting every soup bowl was dirty with food or dirt, the food was cold and the whole place was the slimiest restaurant I've been in. Where are the health inspectors???"}
{"text":"Did not like it. Luke warm food that was not appetizing or tasteful. Not the cleanest establishment."}
{"text":"If you like  noodle soup then China Buffet is the place to go. You can go up at the hibachi and tell them to make you noodle soup. My folks and I love the udon noodle soup. It has alot of flavor. The noodle is included in the buffet price. The sushi is okay depending on the days you go. If you are a sushi lover then go to Fuse Buffet. I love the crab ragoon  because the way it is made. It is not flat crab ragoon. The servers are very nice and they refill your drinks quickly. If you love Pho then you will love the noodle soup they make at the Hibachi."}
{"text":"The food here is very awesome I love the service the atmosphere The Price is Right can you get a chance bring the family to the China Buffet you will not regret it and they have the best house sake and sushi"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the previous reviewer meant when he said that this place serves \"Tibetan\" food. This restaurant is just plain old bottom of the barrel Americanized Chinese food and nothing more. Full of salt, sugar, and oil because almost everything is fried (and what's not fried is drenched in oil). I'll give them credit for being cheap with a $7 buffet, but that's about it.  Negatives: The food was lukewarm. There weren't many options if you wanted to eat anything remotely healthy (unlike real Chinese food). The buffet looks like a cattle feeding trough with all of the obese people hovering around it. And last but not least, the entire town of Champlain is one big butt hole. I think it says a lot that this restaurant was the best thing I could find there.  Positives: The hot tea and the white rice were good. And I guess if you were planning on completing a triathlon this would be a good place to stock up on some calories for a low price. But nobody here exercises."}
{"text":"I had a $5 coupon and decided to check out this place despite all the negative reviews. I don't understand all the comments about taste. The food tasted about the same as any Chinese buffet. Sure nothing was exceptional, but nothing was bad either. In fact there are a couple of things that I really liked - they had fresh steamed dumplings and dim sum. Considering the price tag this place is a great value."}
{"text":"I got explosive diarrhea but was well worth it! I loved the food. It was like most Chinese restaurants but better and a very reasonable price. I'm not a big sushi fan but it looked really good and professionally made. It looked so good I even took a pic of it all. Loved it and I will be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was great! This was a very nice, clean place to eat! Food was great! They have a lot to chose from on the buffet."}
{"text":"Food was ok kinda mediocre lackluster but I was hungry and visiting a new area you have to make do with what's available ok here we go the veggie fried rice was delish as well as The sautéed mushrooms and veggie low mein everything else was stale or just plain ol not appetizing the waitress we were assigned to was great she had a nice sense of humor and had a great spirit if I ever return to the area I might go back here"}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch (around 3) and barely anyone was there. But the food was hot and everything was full.  It's a little pricey for a buffet ($9 for lunch, $13 for dinner) but they have a huge selection, including hibachi. Their sushi is spot on, too. Personally I was surprised by their fruit. Not only was there a lot of the normal fruit (pineapple, watermelon, cantaloupe), it was extra ripe. Expertly picked. I couldn't get enough  They also had sautéed bok choy, which I'm a huge fan of. Everything was well cooked and the selection was huge. Needless to say this is now our regular lunch buffet stop."}
{"text":"Took a party of 8 for an 18-year-old's birthday dinner. Had to stack empty plates on a table nearby. Never asked for drink refills. Sushi bar was dismal, on a Saturday nite no less. Food off steam tables okay but nothing to write home about. Cold shrimp on the salad bar was very good but not worth $13 a plate by any stretch. Will not return."}
{"text":"Buffets can be hit and miss and understandably not for everyone, but this place has been a family favorite for a number of years.  It has the standard fare of Chinese dishes as well as a friendly sushi chef on site prepared to make anything asked for.  The Manager (Tom) is generous and accommodating, and has always offered to make any special vegetarian items when requested.  A few particular favorites are the Broccoli and Tofu in Garlic Sauce, the Bean Curd Szechuan Style, and the Buddhist Delight."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful.  My girl suggested me and we had a lunch date there and it was a good experience they were so many options from veggie to shrimp chicken and etc . Even there deserts have a big menu which I liked it on the top of that they had ice cream which was amazing . The only issue what I see is when we got seated for 10 mins the server dint even got water or ask for drinks . Other than that my meal was perfect ."}
{"text":"Great variety of food and the restaurant is beautiful.  Lots of seating and good service. A++"}
{"text":"Everything is great here all the food is fresh and clean. I always end up coming back here when in a pinch.   The only bad comment that I have with them is not the food but the way they calculate the check.  I have coupons for $1 off from yelp. But they take the $1 off after they calculated the tax and everything. Note: you are not supposed to do that. You are supposed to take $1 off the menu price then calculate the tax. I mean it's just $.10 difference. But it's just a matter of ethics and doing things the right way"}
{"text":"Great food at low prices .this is the only buffet I've ever seen that doesn't charge dinner prices all daylong on the weekends . The sushi fresh and varied, the generals chicken is perfect , I do wish they had chicken wings on the weekends instead of fullsize chicken drumsticks.i can't say enough about the food ,employees and pricing .my pictures are current as of the writing of this review ."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. Originally, I gave it 5 stars, which is rare for me. Unfortunately, the past few times I've eaten there it seems to have suffered the fate most buffets do. Something has drastically changed and everything was bland, plain, with all the deep fried foods tasting exactly the same; like cheap, plain fried batter. Obviously, someone decided they could make more money if they started using cheaper, lower quality food from their food supply company. It's a shame, but I would no longer recommend this place. There are much better Chinese buffets out there."}
{"text":"Lots of good choices, and for $5, you're not going to get better value.  When we go on Saturday afternoon, the pans are kept full, the food is fresh and we enjoy our meal. Serving staff is attentive to keeping drinks available and getting old plates off the table."}
{"text":"This place is okay if you need a quick meal. Not high-class Chinese food by any stretch of the imagination. But at least we didn't have to cook or wash dishes. My husband liked it better than I did. The vegetable-fried rice was good, but the General Tso's chicken was chewy like it was over cooked. The side dishes are cheap buffet, mostly out-of-a-can things. The desserts looked better, but I wasn't in the mood to eat more. The won ton soup was largely unobjectionable. $10 bucks a person."}
{"text":"The sushi is well worth the visit. The other food is decent, but I personally come for the sushi"}
{"text":"Food is affordable. They cook their food on the floor! This is not a joke.it was featured either on the news or in an article. The service was horrible. Will never go back there. The hostess had a horrible attitude. Stay away from them!"}
{"text":"Lol the $1 ofd total bill didn't quite work, not that they didnt honor it but i didnt even get a chance to try...they brought out the bill unexpected.  With that said, this place is solid for $12.99. Someone on here said just the sushi is worth the price, well said! The sushi chef here is very good, some great rolls like rainbow and nigiri. The noodle soup was ok, didnt taste that great, only tried the duck noodle soup. The hibachi has only noodle for starch, but has scallop(small), shrimp, beef, chicken etc. Hibachi tasted good, lot of sauce option. I likes the garlic sauce. The seafood soup makes me question where the seafood is. Has frog legs, steamed fish, crabs, this awesome mousse for dessert that comes in strawberry and chocolate flavor.  The only down side is it is right on independence and mannn it's hard to turn in when traffic is going so fast. Their plates have the restaurant logo and the entrance is nice."}
{"text":"The food was cold and nasty, even the new food wasn't hot. The server never took my plates off the table or refilled our drinks, poor selection, and kinda expensive for such a bad selection. The only thing that was good was the sushi, however, some of the sushi tasted old others not so much. Don't waste your time here. Ish is fkin trash yo."}
{"text":"Beautiful artist and design work done on the part of outside and inside.  Buffet was just ok. Nothing special. Expensive for the quality of the food. Some of the food wasn't warm. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Really not good food at all. I dont ask much from a cheap buffet except to not get sick after one plate but the msg was so bad i could not eat more. My family frequents buffets as i have picky daughter and a hungry husband and this one was the worst and the price is not that cheap once you include drinks"}
{"text":"Having just arrived in Charlotte and staying at the Comfort Suites my family and I loved the convenience of the China Buffet across the road. Having read some pretty average revues I am never one to trust the opinion of others hence I thought we would give China Buffet a chance. Walking through the doors we were greeted by a friendly little staff member who showed us to our table. Despite the floor being covered in filth we overlooked this as it was \"rush hour\". Off to the food. Well, the selection was just like any other Chinese Buffet, yet most of the dishes lacked freshness and especially the craw fish which were obviously frozen and had been reheated several times. The tail meat had shrunk into a grey mess of rubber. We had several attentive waitresses who continually offered to refill my drink. Awesome I thought. Getting half way through every beverage and having it refilled was refreshing. Until I arrived at the cash register and was charged a full glass price for every top-up. STEALING from your customers is not a great idea China Buffet. Toward the end, we had had enough of the bad tasting food, overcooked and reheated. We had had enough of waitresses continually interrupting us as we try to enjoy our meal and the overall disdain these people clearly have for ethics and really caring about the customer experience is obvious. Avoid this place like the plague!!! No \"HAPPY ENDING\" here."}
{"text":"We go here all the time, food is great, and 2 kids and an adult is around $25, service is great and all the reviews that say \"food was cold\" is just because they came here at the wrong time (lunch late night around 9 PM)"}
{"text":"What I liked: A lot of food options (and fresh sushi) for a very cheap price. They also had a pho/noodle bar but I didn't try it because I wanted to fill up on the sushi.   What I didn't like: The sushi chef wasn't putting out any new rolls at a sufficient rate... When I first arrived there was a moderate amount of rolls and good variety. As time went by there was less and less sushi available because people were getting it, which makes sense. But for some reason the sushi chef wasn't making any more! I thought that when the sushi supply was low, he would make lots of new fresh rolls but after 30+ minutes, nothing happened. Second, the seafood options are meh. The clams I had were great, but the squid was so tough and nearly impossible to chew enough to swallow. The cheese concoction on the mussels was also very weird tasting and I couldn't eat it at all without feeling nauseated.   Overall, I'll probably be going back again for sushi cravings when I want to eat a lot for a cheap price, but probably earlier so that I can get more of the sushi before they run out."}
{"text":"For a Chinese buffet this was pretty good. Lots of choices, good flavors, decent sushi. There is a hibachi too with different ways of cooking ingredients (that you get to pick yourself)."}
{"text":"Ugh...don't waste your time or your money!  I would have given it zero stars but the Mei Fun and the Pepsi were actually decent.    The buffet has the typical Chinese fair but the only thing I could come close to suggesting would be the fried shrimp, Mei Fun, and maybe the sweet and sour chicken.  Skip everything else!!!!  Don't even think about eating the sushi.  I was feeling adventurous so I grabbed a few of the sushi rolls that I easily recognized (california, cucumber).  One of them tried to crawl off the plate before I got back to my seat!  The rolls were chewy and just plain gross, makes my stomach turn to think about it.  Service was polite and good on the refills.  Enter at your own risk!"}
{"text":"They should really rename this place Chicken Buffet.  The first row of foods we saw literally was dish after dish with the main ingredient being chicken.  Honey chicken, pineapple chicken, chicken with broccoli, spicy chicken with mushrooms, bourbon chicken, chicken teriyaki, Korean chicken, General Tso's chicken..... and the next row had, you guessed it, more chicken!  2 types of chicken wings, chicken on a stick...  Limited beef and vegetable options, and most of the seafood is either imitation crab or shrimp.  They did have some crawfish when I ate here for lunch though, which was quite tasty.  They have a decent selection of dessert, including ice cream, various cakes, canned and fresh fruits, and pudding.  For lunch it's under 7 dollars and dinner is under 10.  If you want crab legs with your meal it's an extra 3 dollars."}
{"text":"Not as happy with the restaurant this visit. At 5:30 they were out of lettuce on the salad bar. The food was reasonably warm but not hot. What really turned me off was the bathroom. It was filthy. The urinal looked liked it hadn't been cleaned for a month. The service was good, however, but our overall experience was just average."}
{"text":"We have eaten at China Buffet since it first opened years ago.  We LOVE the food.  The problem is, it has become very dirty!  The bathrooms are disgusting, the chair backs are sticky and the tables are not well cleaned.  I am afraid if the front is dirty, what does the kitchen look like.  Not sure why the health dept has not made them clean it up.  What a shame."}
{"text":"I love going to this place.  First, the food is really great, and I love the sushi as well as the habachi grill.  There are plenty of different items to satisfy any taste.  Also, they are so friendly and accommodating, and treat you like a friend.  I just like being there."}
{"text":"I can say without a doubt this is the best Chinese buffet I have been to. Certainly the five star equivalent of Chinese Buffets. $12.99 Sunday lunch/dinner includes fresh sushi that is surprisingly very good...go ahead, don't be afraid. I think my husband ate 19 pieces of Nigiri and he is still alive to tell about it :)     I will admit I am a little phobic when it comes to lots of hands touching my food ....but the space was clean, orderly, and all of the food very fresh. They were constantly turning things over and that made me feel good. If you just can't do the buffet thing they have freshly-made sushi (as noted above), hibachi, and even soups that can be made-to-order.    Note, This is a very kid-friendly restaurant and there were tons of little ones running all over...if that's not your jam I would stick to visiting when the kiddos are in school."}
{"text":"First time here and yes I read the previous review before we came but my wife really wanted Chinese and this was convenient.   The buffet is large with many selections. What I ate of hot food was good but nothing was exceptional.   They have a Mongolian BBQ style hibachi grill but we did not have that either. The selection of items for them to cook for you did not really impress me. I think their focus is on the buffet items an that is fine.   They have sushi as most Chinese buffets do and it was above average for a place like this. There was a sign there that stated they would make things to order. That is nice but I didn't order anything.   My favorite was the \"Chinese\" donuts. I watched them bring out a fresh batch and had to go and get a couple for me and my wife. She had to go and get one more. LOL  There was no steamed rice on the buffet, only fried so my wife asked about it. A waiter said to please wait a minute and directly came back with a bowl of steamed rice.   The wait staff were attentive in our experience and not too much so as the previous reviewer stated.   They also offer a \"seafood\" section for an up charge featuring Crab and other fare (I didn't really look). We didn't have any so I cannot comment on this.   They offered the usual sweets you find at a Chinese buffet as well as an ice cream station. Didn't eat any as the donuts were fresh!  All in all I would say this place is about the same as your standard buffet with the stand out being the sushi.   I would probably eat eat here again but would not go out my way.   Nothing at all bad. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I went into this experience not very excited, as Chinese buffets aren't really my thing. But, the things you do for love I guess.   As far as buffets go, this place seemed pretty clean and the staff were friendly. My favorite part was the scoop your own ice cream section where they had a whole tub of mint chocolate chip waiting for me. Just glad I didn't know about this little section before my meal. I am a child.   I pretty much stuck to the salad bar and sushi. I was impressed with the sushi selection and they had someone rolling it right there. There was also a hibachi station where you bring the chef the ingredients you want.  I thought most of the hot food items either had a weird taste or texture so I ended up wasting a lot."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, real ice cream, clean restaurant, friendly staff. Price was $50 for four of us."}
{"text":"Blech.  I think I must have been at a different buffet than these other reviewers, because this was horrible.  When we walked in, it was like we were in the South Pacific.  Seriously.  The thermostat must have been set at 90.  A nice change from the 40 degree weather outside, but after about three minutes, it was the worst.  Maybe that's for atmosphere, but it was not enjoyable.  To make the experience even less appetizing, the place is cramped and the staff does not help at all in this regard - they are constantly in the middle of the aisles, writing tickets and getting drinks in the middle of the walking areas and the like.  Again, they could be going for atmosphere, and having the staff constantly around is nice, but with overbearing heat and little room to move it's not good.  It's bad.  Really bad.  If you don't like personal space, you're good.  Really good even.  Otherwise, it stinks.  Literally.  I've been to restaurants in big cities, where rent is outrageous, that have more room to move than this.  In Pineville, there ought to be all sorts of elbow room (Schoolhouse Rock anyone?).  Yes, there is a sushi bar where a guy makes it in front of you.  Let me first tell you that I'm not really a sushi guy.  I like California rolls and those little rice cakes with shrimp on them, and a few other things, but none of the more exotic stuff.  But this was nasty.  He would take a big fried thing and plop it down on a plate and squirt some heavy mayo-like sauce all over it.  That's not too bad, right?  Well, once the rolls were gone, he'd do it again - without cleaning the plate.  That's right, there was a buildup of this mayo on the platter.  Several varieties, all right there under the lights.  It was pretty sickening.  Like a sushi hog pond.  On the regular buffet, it wasn't too bad, but it wasn't that good either.  If you want a Southern food buffet (meat, rolls, corn), it's okay.  But the Chinese food was just average.  Add that to the place, the staff, the price - go elsewhere.  China King and Dragon House aren't far away, and Tin Tin is just up the street (though I'm not a huge fan of Tin Tin either).  You'll have a much nicer experience."}
{"text":"As a person that has been going here for quite sometime. You can tell this place has gone way down hill. I remember coming here in high school on week nights and some weekends, this place would be hopping. I mean hard to get seated, food would be hot, and if you were lucky run into some friends that had the same idea for a good dinner.  Now it's just a run down shell of it's former self. The past few times my wife and I went, the food was not hot or fresh. The booths have holes in the seats. And a few times the heat has been on when it was almost 80 degrees outside. The last time I went to this location wasn't because I had had enough of cold food or dining room was to hit. No a cockroach crawled across my table.after seeing this told my wife that we were done eating here and walked out. And have not been back sense. If you are looking for a good Chinese food place I would suggest driving the extra 25 to minutes to the Sailsbury location."}
{"text":"Greasy, salty, over-seasoned and wilting in the steam tables...that says it all. This is a sad imitation of a Chinese buffet, with little to eat that delights the senses. Instead, my tongue was quickly overwhelmed by the cook's heavy use of salt to disguise the food's low quality.   A single star for service, because our waitress was quite sweet and friendly.   Other than that, yuck."}
{"text":"I give the restaurant an average score for a Chinese buffet. There are limited choices and the food was lukewarm when we arrived at opening hours, 11am, on Sunday. I expected the food be fresh but it felt they were sitting out for 30mins prior to opening. The best thing I probably ate was the fried dumplings (4.5/5). The fruits were also very good especially the oranges. There is also plentiful of seat for a local Chinese restaurant. Definitely try to hibachi grill if you aren't satisfied with the foods that are already setup. Cost per person $8.99 for a Sunday is a good deal if you're craving Chinese food. Also, they only had chocolate flavor ice-cream; no vanilla."}
{"text":"As a food blogger and critic who has traveled and eaten at many different restaurants, I've never had and experience like my family and I had here. The food was average on a scale of most Chinese restaurants, and from most of the recent (2016 - 17) reviews below, most people agree. But If you have children under 12, make sure you have their id or birth certificate. Crazy right?!?  I've never heard of such mess. This is the reason I'm giving a 1 Star (would give a zero, but it's not an option). I even had to call the police after my kids told them their ages and the people continued to \"Profiled\" us. My daughter is tall for 12 and will be 13 in January. As soon as the workers asked my kids their ages and my children told them with no hesitation, they still said they didn't believe my children and refused to change what they charged us. They told me that they had people in their 20's say they were 12, and the girl asked me her age. I can careless about your age or what the other customers have done, your calling my children and myself a liar to my face. If they had it posted somewhere that you need an id or birth certificate I would have had no problem with that, but don't judge ever person off of your past experiences. As the officer and I agreed on, \"The Customer Is Always Right!!\"  And then they had the nerve to tell me that we can never come back!?!  Really!?!  Are they stupid enough to believe we would???"}
{"text":"A solid four star experience for a buffet! We had come originally over a year ago and sort of forgotten about this place.  Lunch is very affordable and we thought the sushi was standout!"}
{"text":"A nice place with a good veriety of items including sushi.  About six tables with 10 items each. In addition to sparkling drinks they also have juices (no refill). A decent place when one is in a mood for a Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Decent food... Nothing extraordinary from a typical chinese buffet. The food is ok... nothing to write home about. Service is excellent. The decor is really nice. But it comes down to the food which is sup par."}
{"text":"I love the take out side but the buffet side has issues with hair in the food. I dont know if it's from the cook or the traffic from the customers going back and forth past the food. The first time I found a hair it was half baked into the chicken so that may have been the cook but the second time(in the last 15mins) it was just in with the chicken. I always get the same thing to go and I was really hungry and this disappointed me."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but I wasn't sure if I'd leave with my kidney intact. The booths are jimmy sewed with duct tape and there was a single sad lonely birthday balloon stuck on the ceiling. The balloon has nothing to do with the food and service but it made me feel really contemplative about childhood in America. Anyway, it's probably the best buffet on the east side but it's also like the only buffet on the east side which is to say you should probably just stay home and order takeout, at least that way you can live in denial about the cleanliness of Chinese restaurants from the comfort of your own home."}
{"text":"You guys have obviously never had a good Chinese buffet. Picked over and not fresh. Chicken was disgusting."}
{"text":"The place looks nice and that's where the good comments end.  Lots of choices but they all are really just plain bad.  Hot and sour soup, wierd taste.  Anything seafood, really fishy.  Even the deep fried chicken wings are off.  How do you screw that up?   My first and last visit."}
{"text":"Very nice buffet, definitely better decorated than other buffets I've been to. There are a lot of options at this buffet but 1/2 was bland, cold or just plain not tasty. They don't have white rice or melted butter for the crab legs. They have a lot of sushi but some was lack luster"}
{"text":"I'm torn.  I give the actual eat-in buffet only ONE star, but take-out/ delivery is definitely FIVE stars.  So order take out here. It's amazing. Especially the Crab Puffs.  Don't eat the buffet. The buffet is usually dried out, overcooked, not impressive."}
{"text":"Really don't understand why buffet here always mix Chinese and Japanese food together. It has a Chinese name but wth are those \"hibachi\" and \"sushi\" words, it's Japanese not chinese! k about the food, generally neither good nor bad, no big difference from Tokyo Grill or Ichiban, but the Hibachi is special and I think would be good. More expensive than Tokyo for lunch, and dunno whether a student card can get a discount"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese buffet.  Nice selection and good service."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. This is one of the best Chinese/sushi buffets, if not the best I have tried. The hot food I can't really speak on because the sushi was so darn good. The selections were numerous and fresh. They also have seaweed salad, squid and octopus salads which were all very good. Not your run of the mill buffet sushi by any means. Dessert was good with a selection of real ice cream that you scoop yourself. The restaurant is large, clean and newly renovated. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was some of the worst food I've had at a buffet. I came in with my young family and they sat us in the back by a bunch of boxes that clearly should have been thrown out or put out of sight of customers. The older lady in charge clearly has a attitude and is not friendly. I will never come back here save yourself the waste of food you will end up not eating."}
{"text":"If you haven't stopped by and had the sushi lately...you are missing some of the best in K-town area..the sushi on the bar is fresh and tasty...Be sure and have Jack make you a special roll. I guarantee you will continue to come back for more. I definitely will be going back and I drive from Virginia!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty Good.. food fresh at 4.30pm. Room is a little on the dark side."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was the missing selection labels on half of the items. But I'll chalk that up to a lazy worker of the shift and move on.   I liked the Hibachi food (though some WRITTEN instructions on where to stand and how to order would have been nice). I liked the cooked sushi. I wanted some cold sushi, but it appeared you needed to order it and I didn't have a list to pick from. I liked most things I took from the hot Chinese food section. I tried some unknown dishes just to be bold about it and they weren't to my liking. But everything I was familiar with tasted great!  VERY reasonable pricing and the wait staff were quick to clear our dirty plates. All four people in our party left bellies filled and happy. 4 stars earned."}
{"text":"I rarely care to review Chinese buffet, but this one is amazing. Love the variety of food, great service, and how fresh and delicious everything is!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple months ago when they first opened . Large selection, loved the noodle bar , but won't be going back until there sanitation grade is an A"}
{"text":"5 star buffet for sure.  If you are in the University area and are looking for a quick lunch for minimal cost, this is your spot.  China Buffet has become my go to place for lunch.  I have been here three times and each experience has been great.  I have gotten seated quickly and served a drink promptly.  My waiters have been attentive without being overbearing.  Their sushi bar is excellent!!!  It has lots of variety and special rolls.  Definitely the best sushi I have found in the University area.  Hibachi and Chinese buffet foods were great as well.  The only thing I have yet to try is their soup bar.  The soups look amazing, but I am usually to full to eat one.  Absolutely will try one next time.  I highly recommend the place.  You won't be disappointed.  Truly sorry it took me so long to find it as I have worked in the area for several years."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Holiday Inn next door, and dinner time rolled around, so I strolled over here and had a delightful dinner buffet.  I was very pleasantly surprised by their Crab and Cheese casserole type thing which was quite good.    Overall, they had a sizable collection of food for a reasonable price, and I certainly left quite full."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food.  I love buffets. So when I found China Buffet close to my hotel on a recent business trip I was anxious to try.  Upon entering I noticed the strong smell of steamed seafood which I took as a good sign however it turned to disappointment.    I started with the soups. The egg drop had a fairly thick consistency but turned out tasteless. The hot and sour was hot but not sour.  On to the seafood course. Crawfish rubbery, calamari the same and the steamed shrimp was overlooked. The fried courses of wings, fish and ribs were dry and rubbery. Next the mixed Chinese course with chicken and broccoli, noodles and fried rice all bland and soggy.   Upon having to sit there clearly finished as my waitress ignored me I finally had to ask for the check. Being from out of town I thought it was a little pricey.   All in all I was unimpressed."}
{"text":"At first, I thought this buffet was awesome sauce, but then I walked around and realized that it was similiar to all the other Chinese buffets I've been to.   Why does this get 4 stars then? Asking the important questions. The sushi selection is great. They have a wide variety of sushi that looks like it could come from a sushi restaurant. The sushi is what earned this establishment an extra star. Just a side note- if you like wasabi, get extra. Their wasabi is so weak here, I barely tasted it. Where's the kick?  Aside from this, you have your traditional buffet food. Dessert section looked good but ended up being disappointing. Egg tart tasted gross and not fresh. I would stick with ice cream.   Service was fine! They were attentive to when we needed refills and cleared our plates often. I may or may not be back- depends on my mood."}
{"text":"It's ok. 3 stars because it did have variety and decent amount of choices and the price was right, but overall we won't be back. Food was warm, some stuff not so fresh, dessert choices scarce, service was fast but not overly friendly, no smiles..nope, not a good first impression."}
{"text":"Used to be a good place to go but has gone down hill. Restrooms are falling apart with roaches everywhere. The food was meh and my drink had insect pieces (wings and legs) it was disgusting and nauseating and when I told the waitress she said nothing just took my cup and gave me more water. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"The service here used to be good I don't know what happened but the owners need to bring the old serves back. The girl they have sitting people acts like a little kid in a candy store she is not cut out to be hostess she spends her time laughing and flirting with the serves not very professional at all. I think this is my last time coming here I would rather drive out of my way and eat at a restaurant that has professional staff"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here everytime him or I are in town. This place to me can kind of b3 a hit and miss at times. The last time we went this week it was kind of a miss. Didn't enjoy it as much as I did before. However I did enjoy the station were you can  create your own noodles."}
{"text":"This place was underestimated from the beginning by myself and my bf. We got way more than expected and it was delicious! Timing is everything though, because my second visit flopped. (Visit was the same dinner time, both on a Sunday evening.) The food was mediocre, and drink refills were hard to come by our server. Still good rating overall! Customer service needs improvement, but maybe best out of 3?"}
{"text":"Avoid this place.  Food was decent, but a lot of it was cold and did not taste fresh.  I tried the crab legs on the buffet, and as soon as I cracked them an ammonia smell was present.   They had a lot of American dishes on the buffet as well, over salted and overall not that good.   The other food was decent, but as I said before was cold.   However, the sushi was decent, not the quality you expect at an actual sushi restaurant.  But the guy making made me a custom roll and was very nice about it.    However, if you do come, just get the sushi, it's worth the price and just avoid the buffet."}
{"text":"As far as buffets go, this place is pretty great.  The buffet has all of the normal Chinese food that you would expect. It also has a sushi bar, a salad bar and a dessert section.   Lots of options for a finicky eater that might not like Chinese or for anyone trying to feed a small child.     Service was quick and the staff was very accommodating to our screaming one year old (yes, we got the joy of being THOSE people).   Definitely a restaurant that we will return to."}
{"text":"Better experience than last time,  but  What's the deal with them trying to seat us Right Beside the only other occupied table in the restaurant! ?  This happens every time we come!   Who wants to sit and listen to other patrons conversations? Not Us!  Especially here,  WAY too cramped plus there are 15 other available booths and tables!  Food was good this time,  Service just okay.."}
{"text":"The food was barely warm, eggplant patties were cold, so many of the dishes were mixed together basically all taste the same. Husband is vegetarian so thought this would be a good choice.  Go to a restaurant read the menu get what you like, don't settle for China Buffet  Not worth the $$"}
{"text":"Will not go back ever. ....would not recommend eating here after 7 cause that's the time I went ...first off...food was cold and everything was hard...and they never would bring out fresh food we had to wait so long for something to come out..i ask three times for when is the food coming out ..i thought this is a buffet but its like i had to order not kool its a buffet...chicken was hard .teriyaki chicken tasted old and nasty nothing taste fresh all over sat food cold...my wife said she came before earlier it wasn't that bad but I think closer to closing after 7 they don't like bringing food out .I got two plates and didn't even eat it I took a couple of bits that's all .not enough food ..we sat by the kitchen. That was the nastiest kitchen smell in the world ...it gross me and my family out so bad that my wife got sick from the smell ....our water was dirty water and tasted like it looked nasty....it give one star for the ice cream that was good...."}
{"text":"Definitely the best value in the area as far as Asian buffet goes. Just moved in the neighborhood and will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Don't go here,  just don't.  I went in with little expectations.  My only expectations were to eat shitty food and to not get sick. Unfortunately,  the food was much worse than I expected.  The only thing that was half decent was the ice cream in containers, not from the machine. And as I'm sure you have guessed,  I got sick. Very sick.  Don't do it! Save yourself hours of laying in agony with stomach cramps from hell and multiple trips to the bathroom.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Chinese food in buffet.  Not planning on visiting here again.  I am not a fan of employees cleaning windows right next to the table I am eating at.  Spraying window cleaner by my plate is not a good idea. :)   The food was so-so and service OK.  What else to say?  Wish I could like the place, its close to home."}
{"text":"I visited yesterday for lunch with my co-workers. The decor is beautiful. You'll be impressed by the set up and beautiful statues. They have lots of seating, although you may not have as much room as you'd like.   The food was nothing special. It will look and taste very similar to all the other Chinese buffets out there. It wasn't terrible but it will not be the best you've ever had either.   The service is where this place really shines. The staff is super friendly and helpful. We did not have to wait very long for drinks or to have plates removed.   All in all a decent place if you want some quick Chinese food with a lot of different varieties, but if you are looking for high quality cuisine, keep driving."}
{"text":"The place as clean and didn't smell Waitresses and waiters were friendly. The habachi needs improvement. The place is beautiful. I enjoyed the chicken and brocolli myself"}
{"text":"What can you say about a Chinese buffet. They're typically kind of all the same and equally delicious. This one happens to be right around the corner from my house so I've been quite a few times. Never disappoints, always good food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Much cleaner than any chinese buffet I have ever been to, and the staff was extremely nice. Best seafood delight I have ever had."}
{"text":"I took my wife and daughter for lunch. Everyone enjoyed the food.  In my opinion, the shrimp was overdone. All else was good. The service was great.  I noticed that while the ice cream scoop was, indeed, in water, there was running water in the container making sure the water was regularly changed. Would definatly go there again."}
{"text":"Went here because I was in the area and they've been in business forever.  Yikes, first visit last visit.  Visit was 1pm lunch, monday.  -Hot and sour soup just egg drop with vinegar and brown sauce.  Tasted funky, not a good sour...more like that creeping sour taste of something going bad.  -Octopus dish rubbery, no taste.  -Poor selection, minimal shrimp dishes, minimal variety, everything tasted the same.  -Lo mein noodles tasted wierd and sour, no sesame oil flavor, no char on noodles.  -Sesame chicken and scallion chicken tasted the same; sweet like marshmallow, we're all breading, and we're cold.   -Most dishes I tried were off temperature...makes you wonder what the sanitation score was.  The one good thing was the girl at the register was very friendly.  Save your money people.... goto Tin Tin or the Chinese place at the mall food court."}
{"text":"Very decent for a Chinese buffet.  I think dinner was about $15-16 per person.  For the price I was hoping for crab legs but I didn't see any.  There were enough quality dishes to make up for that however.  There was plenty of other seafood dishes so I was happy.  The food was hot and the booths were packed.  This place is new and clean so that gets a few stars right there.  I definitely will be back but $16 per person makes this place more of a treat than a regular place for me and my girlfriend ($16x2 plus drinks, tax, and tip gets pricey....almost Tin Tin prices but no crab legs).  This place is worth checking out if you are on the fence, as far as I can tell this is the new place to try if you like Chinese buffets."}
{"text":"We've been to this buffet at least a dozen times and the quality of the food varies with the time you choose to dine.  Like most buffets, entries can sit on a steam table for a substantial period of time and, obviously, the longer it has languished in its tray, the worse it will taste.    The China Buffet has a good variety of options.  I have usually had the best luck with the Mongolian beef.  The chicken selections are usually pretty decent also.  The shellfish and baby octopus are mediocre.  The fried rice, noodles, and soups are acceptable as are the salad selections and deserts.  I really think that if you're looking for great Chinese food you're better off to avoid the buffets, but if you're just hungry and you need to fill a void without needing a taste experience, this place is as good as any other buffet I've tried in the Phoenix Metro area.  I'm still looking for a great Chinese buffet and have yet to find it.  Maybe it's a mythical place.  If anyone has any suggestions, I'd like to hear them."}
{"text":"My husband and I take the kids here every once in awhile. We all have our favorite dishes, I absolutely love the green beans! We tend to stay away from the seafood, clams, ocotopuss, oysters, etc, it smells raunchy and looks questionalbe. My husband always refused to try sushi, but gave in and tried the cream cheese roll. He now gets 3 or 4 of them and devours them whole! Sometimes I catch my daughter watching the sushi being made. Shes facinated! We really enjoy the selection. My kids love the candy coated peanuts and pizza. The waitresses, however could use some coaching when it comes to being polite. We always say please and thank you, but we always get a blank stare or some kind of smirk on their face. We always tip though...maybe these women dont know about Karma? All in all, we love the food and always enjoy going there!"}
{"text":"Dont waste your money.  The Crab Rangoon was very bland, it had no taste whatsoever and the fried rice was orange and had major amounts of oil.  The chicken was just ok."}
{"text":"Needs help, service is great, food is not. Cleanliness is sketchy at best. Chinese cooked by a Latin cook, he is a great worker, but ingredients lack in everything. Pass by if able. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Have been on the east side since October and searched for a good Chinese buffet. Took a shot in the dark and went to this place and wasn't disappointed. Only $4.99 for lunch, I ate my fill of sesame chicken and chicken with broccoli with a lot of rice. They had what looked like a good selection of sushi but I'm not a seafood fan so I didn't try any. The food was also constantly rotated and fresh which really impressed me. I have never seen so much efficiency on a buffet line. The staff was friendly and I didn't see anyone resembling the \"skeletor\" that was mentioned in another review. I could also see much of the kitchen from where I was seated and everything looked very clean and up to standards (which I know is a concern for people sometimes.) The decor is a bit worn but I'd take a place like that over an overly fancy restaurant every day. Definitely a hidden gem and a good place to get a cheap lunch."}
{"text":"One of the better buffets in town. I love the hibachi and sushi. Haven't had the soups. They always have a good selection of different and sometimes weird foods. Try the octopus, it's good. But they do sometimes have the soggy General tso's, and Sesame chicken problem, and sometimes you will find cold food."}
{"text":"Not very good. Dried out food. Some things cold, when they should be hot. Disappoined overall. Not clean, either. 11.99 per person not worth it."}
{"text":"Gross and nasty. My dog would not eat here. Don't order the schnitzle...they're serving schnauser!"}
{"text":"A pretty standard Chinese buffet.  The have a nice seafood selection, mussels, fish, shrimp, crab, etc.  I wasn't adventurous to try it but they had octopus.  They also had sushi, but I'm not a sushi fan so I didn't try it so I can't say much about it.  They also had the standard Americanized dishes too.  They did a good job of bringing out fresh food.  Like any buffet the quality is going to suffer over a sit down place, but I like the variety.  Not the greatest Chinese buffet I've ever eaten at, but China Buffet is pretty decent."}
{"text":"I've been coming to China Buffet for approximately 10 years now. When I first moved to Pineville in 2001 this was just somewhere close to eat cheaply. At that time they did not have the sushi chef.  The Chinese Buffet: Nothing to write home about. Nothing here is truly worth mentioning. Just your standard Chinese buffet fare mostly covered i thick, syroupy sauces and probably very unhealthy. Nothing is particularly good but nothing is particularly bad either.  The Sushi Buffet: This is why you want to come here (unless you're a sushi snob because no matter what you''re just not gonna be happy)! All you can eat sushi for around $10 (which also includes the Chinese buffet portion but let's pretend it doesn't for the heck of it). This is pretty unbeatable given that the sushi is freshly made throughout the day. Yes, I do agree that the presentation plates could be wiped off between servings on the fried pieces with heavy sauces but not all their offering has tick coatings of sauces. So, in my case, I don't eat those. I like them... but I chose to eat the ones that are not covered in thick sauces and look more presentable.  Tony, the sushi chef (I don't know the other guys'  name but thank god he's rarely if ever there) is really cool. He's very engaging with his customers, he remembers your name and your family. He greets you openly and warmly and is always ready to offer suggestions on new things to try. Remember to tip him well even if you don't touch the Chinese food (I usually don't, except for the egg drop soup)  The staff is very serviceable and are constantly refilling your glass and cleaning your table. They speak very little English but enough to understand what you want should you be the pesky customer who needs everything customized in a buffet style restaurant. Unfortunately, as someone else say, they do have the very rude tendency of always getting in the way and NEVER giving the customer the right of way. They cut in front of you and make you stop or go around them instead of them doing so for the customer. This is what knocked one star.  Obviously the staff has changed through the years. I remember a couple of waitresses throughout the years that were really nice and helpful. They got to know my little girls and tried teaching them how to eat with chop sticks. So, my, and Becky's, kids all love it here. This is definitely a good place to take children since they can pretty much try a bunch of things without worrying about not liking it (This is, after all, where my, at the time, 5 year old fell in love with Ikura). The owner, although in all the time I've been going has never once acknowledged that I am a regular (sometimes twice to three times a month) regular, seems rather unfriendly and, actually, kinda sour. I don't know if he is or not... but he doesn't seem very welcoming, warm or friendly. Not that it bothers me, I don't care, I'm there to eat... but I noticed it.  The decor is a mix of traditional chinese with some modern lighting and tacky foreign cluelessness (yes, I just made all that up but when you see it it'll make sense). And the place is very clean except for the ice cream machine which doesn't get enough TLC from the staff.  This is a great place to come and have lunch once in a while if you work in the area or have kids who want to try Chinese or have sushi lovers (not snobs) who want good sushi for free. But this is not the type of place that you will be making special trips to visit. Try to avoid dinner as it gets rather expensive without any appreciable additions to the buffet."}
{"text":"The building is beautiful and the staff is very nice and welcoming. The food is par/ subpar if you judge the look of the building you would think the food was 5star. It's decent at best unfortunately. 14$ for a dinner buffet...I'll take it"}
{"text":"For the price, I bestow upon thee, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Drinks with colleagues turned into a mistake on Independence. Seriously, after a day of not eating and a few beers down we thought a Chinese buffet would be a good idea. Not expecting authentic Chinese food or even good food, but we did expect it to be edible. This place was not clean and the food was practically inedible. Managed to eat some sautéed string beans, mushrooms, and soup but everything else looked highly suspect.   Save your money and go somewhere else. Too pricey for the low quality of food."}
{"text":"Out of all, the many.... Chinese buffets, I have had the uh... Uh... I have visited, I hate this one the least. The made to order Lo-Mein, is pretty nummy, a bit on the salty, msg side but nummy. The salmon is also eatable, salty, Yes but this IS Chinese food. Everything is a tad salty, jaja. The vegetable fried rice has always been decent, along with the spring rolls, green beans, and fried plantains. Oh the French Fries were surprisingly crunchy. Meow."}
{"text":"When you first walk into the copper entry doors you feel like you are at a very expensive, snooty restaurant, but thats actually not the case. Very modern and flashy, the interior soothes the eyes, as the great food soothes your pallet. Modestly priced at $10-11 per person for adults, there is an ample selection of hot, fresh food, as well as a Mongolian style buffet where you add ingredients for the chef to make you teriyaki, hibachi or garlic dishes while you watch. My family loves the vast selection of beef, chicken, fish and seafood dishes that align the 10 or so buffet servers. Hot food is brought out constantly, even when attendance is lacking. Our new favorite asian buffet!"}
{"text":"food was good , it was fresh  place was clean thiught it  was a little expensive for lunch"}
{"text":"Pretty decent compared to other places in the area. A lot better than the one by Grand & Reems. I will come here again."}
{"text":"they used to be great, however, after Tokyo Buffet opened up, their business got slammed. Sadly, the taste got worse as well."}
{"text":"I came here for egg foo young and they brought me what looked like an omelette. The quality of the food looked poor as soon as we got our plates. It was nasty. We barely touched our food. They didn't offer to prepare anything else. They gave us a 20% discount on food we didn't eat. Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"All you can eat crawfish and above average chinese buffet food.  I think they get their fish on Thursday as Friday  is always best, the Sushi can be milky on a tuesday.  Sometimes they have octopus sashimi, salmon skin, and eel nigiri.   The octopus is usually fire but sometimes they serve it past when the should and it starting to pus yellow.  They can make you most rolls on command including hand rolls."}
{"text":"At $12.99 a person for dinner (on a week night), it's a little pricey. BUT they had blue crabs, clams in black bean sauce, steam flounder, sushi, salt & pepper shrimps (with heads), crawfish, noodle station and other food items that can make this worths the money.   I normally come here with my parents. My mom always has $1 off per person coupon with her (it's out there, not sure which neighborhood coupon booklet).   The service is... well, it's a chinese buffet so there's not much of a service to speak of. On the plus side, my water glass was never empty.   Overall food is ok and in good supply (I HATE all-you-can-eat places where they're stingy with bringing out hot food). Not a bad option in the area."}
{"text":"Hidden gem on independence! Best Chinese buffet I've had in Charlotte. Hibachi made to order from the buffet, huge variety of sushi and endless normal buffet option. They also have hand scooped ice cream along with cheesecake, chocolate cake and many other dessert options. All for $12.99! Such a great deal with great service. This will be our new buffet spot. (And that's coming from a staunch Ru-San's buffet supporter.)"}
{"text":"Excellent.  My favorite chinese buffet.  Everything is fresh and good.  The sushi is the best I've had at a chinese buffet with tuna rolls, etc.  The crablegs are included with dinner (maybe only on weekends, not certain) but they are great."}
{"text":"No complaints. While the Chinese food options were the usual chicken in sauce or fried bits of meat in batter, the sushi table was clean and fresh with a reasonable selection. Better than most others in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"China Buffet is the standard fare Chinese buffet - the standard items you would expect are on the buffet line including beef and broccoli, chicken and broccoli, vegetable lo-mein, fried dumplings and the like. There's also a few non-traditional items, such as french fries and fried sliced potatoes. The standout item was the honey chicken which was sweet and very tasty though the pieces of chicken were almost all dark meat.  China Buffet also has a separate sushi area and the sushi was better than I have experienced at most Chinese buffets but not nearly as good as a proper sushi restaurant. The California rolls were fresh and they had a few pieces of salmon and shrimp sushi. The sad face goes to the rolls that were not only deep fried in batter but were then literally drowned in sauces over the top. Yuck!  The service was almost too attentive, with the waitress offering to refill our drinks when they were still more than half filled. The sweet tea was too sweet, almost sickly.  The buffet line was well tended and all of the items were stocked, though it looked like some of the items, such as the chicken and broccoli were 90% vegetables and only 10% meat.  Would I come here again? No, I don't think so. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I have trouble passing up Chinese buffets, so when it was lunchtime and I had an hour until I needed to pick up my wife from her nearby dental appointment, I headed here!  Not too busy on a weekday at 11:45, there were plenty of tables. The food on the steam tables appeared pretty fresh (or at least as fresh as it can be in this situation). Pretty solid for straight carbs with noodles and rice dishes, the usual protein heavy trays were a bit lacking. You could probably do better if you wanted to do the hibachi where you can put in as much meat or chicken as you like. But where China Buffet seems to excel is over at the sushi section. A very good selection and not just the boring ones. There was mackerel. And more. Hey, I took a pic.  Service was good. My waiter was back and forth often to refill my water glass (you should really drink a lot of water at a Chinese buffet).  I liked it. I'll try and be back!"}
{"text":"The sushi is great but the food on the bar is very average to below in my opinion. We very rarely come but sometimes brave the little food choice for some sushi.   Tips:ask Tony at the sushi bar for a crazy roll! If you like egg drop soup you will want to skip it here, it's bland."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. First time. Pretty darn good. Large selection of the usual buffet items. All seemed fresh. Nothing looked like it had been sitting there long. Enjoyed it and will come back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for Chinese food. They are similar to every other Chinese buffet out there but that's a good thing. You know what to expect and you aren't let down by anything. Lots of options and everything was delicious. I liked the custard and ice cream offered. I will definitely be going back for more in the future!"}
{"text":"Had dinner their last and it was hands down the best chinese buffet I've been to in Charlotte so far. The place is beautiful and spacious inside. The hostesses and wait staff were all very friendly.  I don't think I've ever seen such a large variety of food before than was here! Seafood, sushi, classic chinese dishes, hibachi, dessert and even some typical American food.  The sushi was wonderful, the hibachi was far better than I would've expected. Egg rolls, chicken dishes, lo mein and  fried rice were all exceptional. Like any buffet though, there some dishes I tried that were getting close to needing to be replaced, and therefore weren't as great as could be. Overall, for $12.99/person (for 2 people my totally bill was $32 incl. 2 drinks), I was beyond impressed and will definitely go back! They also do buffet takeout by the pound, only $3.99/Lb for lunch and $4.99/Lb for dinner!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of food. Sushi was already worth the 13 bucks dinner buffet. Thumbs up for the crawfish (best around feb-may). I like the made to order soups up near the sushi n hibachi area, the vietnamese beef noodle soup (pho) was pretty decent."}
{"text":"The food is just what you would expect from a place called China Buffet. Being that it is right in the university area, there are crowds of people that just want a cheap meal, which isn't really that cheap. This makes the atmosphere very busy and loud. The food is ok, but nothing really special and is definitely not a step above other Chinese buffets. I only give it two stars because our waitress was actually really nice and refilled our drinks very promptly. But if you are looking for good quality food, just go ahead and skip this one."}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place a shot. You can't really mess up Chinese food. American Chinese food that is... well this place proved me wrong! Almost everything was off! General tsaos seasame bourbon chicken all nasty and hard! Spring rolls and egg rolls mushy! Macaroni and cheese absolutely no flavor! Lo mein had absolutely zero flavor! The best thing they had were these fried corn nuggets! Corn nuggets at a Chinese restaurant! What a shame! I will never return to this restaurant and want to warn anyone of going! Please save your money!!! Take your kids somewhere else to eat some food worth eating! Left feeling unsatisfied! Oh and I forgot to mention when I grabbed a plate from the buffet it was absolutely filthy! Do not eat here!"}
{"text":"Honestly when my friend wanted to drag me here I was not down. But the inside is gorgeous and the food is legitimately good. They have a hibachi buffet where you pick the re ingredients for your hibachi and give it to the chef, which is awesome. Plus all of the rest of the stuff is pretty good too. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent selections and reasonable price! Has noodle area and make noodle in front of you! Habbachi area! And a decent sushi selection with nigiri for lunch buffet! I wish I live closer to the area!"}
{"text":"Dinning for thanks giving lunch. noodle soup was great. Sushi was so fresh !!  Seafood and ice cream also great too."}
{"text":"I give it a 1.5 of 5.  Food that shouldn't ever be greasy, is.  Weird.  Other times it tastes ok....to unpredictable for me"}
{"text":"Another buffet option for the University Area.  They did a lot of cosmetic changes to the building structure (used to be a Cajun/Mardi Gras Place?) but it definitely has its share of finishes - really heavy looking copper doors and asian-esq statues flanking the doors.  We were seated pretty quickly and there was a pretty good lunch crowd already.  The place can accommodate a lot of people (parking... not so much... but there are signs for additional parking in the back).  Waitstaff was friendly and prompt with drink refills.  There is a good selection of food ranging from chicken nuggets, fries, to a full on hibachi grill were the food is cooked to order.   Sushi is also available, but I was a little disappointed since it looked like the sushi had been sitting out for a while...  I know it's hard to do a sushi buffet, but some of the rolls looked a little questionable and I stayed away for fear of later issues in my work day.  I was surprised at the price of the buffet 7.99 - so the price does seem right for what you get.  Would I come back... probably... but I can't really do buffets since I feel so miserable afterwards.  My favorite thing in there was the emergency exit door with the sign, \"EMERGENCY EXIT - ALARM WILL BE SOUND\"....  so we know the alarm will sound, or the alarm is good to go?  It gave me a little chuckle."}
{"text":"Food was not good except the stuffed mushrooms. Not much of a choice on the buffet. the waitress was very prompt and continuously filled our drinks."}
{"text":"Running errands on Sunday and the significant other spotted this place from the road so off we went. We had not been to a Chinese buffet since moving to Charlotte and thought it was time to give it a go.  The place itself is pretty big but they have the tables in a congested area. They were pretty busy on our visit and constantly putting out freshly cooked food.  The variety of food for what we paid was good. They offered an ample amount of seafood options as well as chicken and beef.  For our Sunday visit, we paid $12.99 for adult and $4.99 for our child. Then additional charge of $1.69 per drink.   Also on our visit, they sure did have the heater on. Make you nice and hot so you don't stay so long. lol.  Food overall was okay. Not bad, not great - mediocre Americanized Chinese eats."}
{"text":"It's pretty damn amazing. I come on week nights when it's not busy. Weekends are too lit for me. They have a little bit of everything. Stop by and check it out your self."}
