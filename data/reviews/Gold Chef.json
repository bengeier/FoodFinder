{"text":"Came in and servers were attentive. Asked for drink order and they served us on time with refills. Husband gets food first and eats in front if me. Its now 5 minutes past the time he got his plate. Is this ok? No."}
{"text":"We're new to the neighborhood, but just found our new go-to Chinese takeout. The price is good and you get great food. The sesame beef is awesome, the hot and sour soup may be the best I've had, but my wife and I didn't think the orange chicken/general tso's chicken had as much flavor."}
{"text":"Alas I am sad to report the owners have stepped away from the business and quality has gone downhill."}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst Chinese food I have ever had! The lemon chicken tasted like super cheap lemon meringue pie (no joke). The chicken was cooked to death and more bread than meat. My gf's food was not much better. 
I had very simple expectations and I was still sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"THROW AWAY ALL OF YOUR OTHER CHINESE TAKE OUT/ DELIVERY MENUS! This place is AMAZING!The BEST Chinese food I've had in a very very long time. My boyfriend and I were craving some Chinese and sick of all of the mediocre delivery places in the area so we turned to yelp (of course) to help us find something new.... we found this place w really good reviews and decided to give it a shot. At first site it is a clean and comfortable casual dining space. Brightly painted modern walls and plenty of two or four person tables. Up front there are some seats occupied by people waiting for  their scrumptious take out. You are greeted nicely by someone who will seat you then get drinks for you (even though there is a soda machine and you can do it yourself) The menu is filled with terrific beef, chicken, pork,duck,lamb and seafood options. Here is the great part, it's not your typical fast food Chinese place the dishes are really restaurant quality.We started with the egg rolls because quite a few reviews mentioned how fresh they were. We got one egg roll and one shrimp egg roll. They were so fresh the cabbage was still crispy. Best egg rolls ever!Then we moved on to the sizzling rice soup which was chock full of large shrimp chicken and pork and freshly added veggies.  I had the szechuan chicken and my boyfriend had the jalapeno steak. The portions are not only generous and like 8 bucks they are prepared so fresh that the veggies are still crisp my favorite. The chicken dish had broccoli, red peppers, onions,water chesnuts,baby corn,mushrooms and the presentation is beautiful.. big pieces of sliced meat, large  veggies nothing diced.The sauces are full of flavor, not salt you can both see and taste your entrees. The jalapeno steak was super delicious and spicy very, very good. It had green peppers, jalapeno peppers, onions, red peppers, chili flakes and some smokey and spicy delicious sauce. I was kind of jealous i'll probably get that next time. Overall this is the best Chinese in Phoenix. They could easily charge 12 bucks a plate. Phoenix needs more locations, let's help them expand!!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese Food I've found in the area. The atmosphere was pleasant, the staff very kind and friendly, and the food was amazing. My appetizer came out right away, and my meal soon after. Everything was hot and fresh. I will definitely be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after reading previous reviews on Yelp.  You guys didn't lie!  This is a great little place.  We were nicely surprised to find they had dine-in seating.  Everything was clean & neat, despite the fact that it was the lunch hour.  Our waitress was quick, efficient, & friendly.  We had crab puffs which were small but so tasty that size didn't matter.  I had kung pao chicken which was delicious, diced into just the right size bites & had a lot of peanuts.  The sauce was spicy but not overwheming or too much.  My son had szechuan beef which he devoured, declaring it the best he's eaten for a long time.  Our tea glasses were never empty, even on a 105 day.  And all the food came out of the kitchen with steam rolling off it.  Prices were very reasonable.  We will def be back!  You can't beat this for a quick neighborhood-ish bite or take out!"}
{"text":"I was in the shopping complex around lunchtime and thought I would try them out, support local business.  Boy, was that a mistake!  The lady at the counter was nice enough and my to-go lunch was ready fairly quickly.  When I opened the box, however, UGH.  Seriously, who the heck puts POTATOES in their Teriyaki Chicken?!?  I paid extra for noodles, expecting at least some bean sprouts or green onions but no.  Just noodles.  Very salty noodles.  And the spring roll that came with the lunch had almost nothing in it.  Really, just a couple of small pieces of carrot and one bean sprout with a slimy inside.  Do yourself a favor and go up the street to Panda Express.  It is cheaper and has better food.  No wonder local restaurants fail, if they serve food like this!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Kung pao shrimp and there was a hair in it. I told the lady who served us about it and all she offered me was an egg roll"}
{"text":"Very tasty Chinese food!  Friendly staff.  Quite affordable.
I really enjoyed their Honey Chicken."}
{"text":"Woohoo is right!  I could eat here every day of the week! 

We are vegetarian, and it is often difficult to find VARIETY in menus for us... you want to die and go to heaven? - then order the Lo Mein with curry sauce... sigh... their Moo Shu sauce would make ROCKS taste good!!!

Just simple, great food... delivered quickly with a smile... AND.... they'll make it YOUR way - I've had them call ME just to make certain I've ordered correctly!  

LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"this place has never let me down...delivery is quick and simply delish!!"}
{"text":"Food was great and fresh! Decent prices. Friendly staff. My only complaint is it took a long time to get my food. No experience with delivery yet but plan on trying it out again soon"}
{"text":"The food was delivered very quick.  It was very fresh tasting - which isn't always the case when you order Chinese food!  Very close by so I am very sure I will order from here again :)"}
{"text":"Really good food! And one if the few Chinese places where the staff smiles.. Good vibes ;)"}
{"text":"My first time ordering from this place. Delivery got to my home sooner that the expected time. The food was ok. I expected a lot more based on the reviews I read here. I ordered general tso which tasted more like orange chicken. The shrimp Lo Mein was decent. Overall... I've had better Chinese food."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place a hundred times going to the Walmart, but never stopped....why did I wait so long??? I ordered the General Tso's chicken dinner combo and it was excellent! All the food (egg drop, fried noodles, chicken, fried rice, egg roll and crab puffs) was hot, fresh, perfectly cooked and tasted great. Some Chinese restaurants can gross me out with the questionable food quality...especially chicken, but not this place, everything was top quality and the service was equally as good. The only negative was the General Tso's sauce was a little more sweet and less garlicky than I prefer, but still very good. I will definately be back for more!"}
{"text":"This really is as good as it gets for a casual Chinese place. Delicious, fresh and affordable. This place has it all. I got a little advert in the mail for the place that had the takeaway menu and some coupons on the back. We decided to order 3 lunch specials around 11:00 am and got two orders of the Mongolian Beef and one of the Szechuan Chicken with fried rice and egg drop soup. We asked for delivery and told them we had a coupon, paid with a credit card over the phone and were told it would take 35-40 minutes for them to arrive.

Right around 11:40 they arrived and delivered the food. We tipped in cash and opened up the food. The food arrived in individually packed meals kind of like Pei Wei, with the rice and meat all in one box. The egg drop soup was packaged separately and they were huge! This was no small serving of soup. We also got 3 fortune cookies and plastic utensils, soy sauce packets, and napkins. These were all thoughtful touches I appreciated.

The soup was a 12 oz container packed full to the brim. The soup was a clear golden broth full of swirls of cooked egg. There were no vegetables or chunks of tofu, just eggs mixed in the broth, but it was great. Very comforting. I doctored mine up by dropping 2 tbsp of frozen peas and a tiny bit of soy sauce into it and since the soup was very hot, it cooked the peas to the perfect consistency in a few minutes.

The Mongolian Beef wasn't like any Mongolian Beef I have ever had (you know, the typical sort of crispy meat in that dark brown intense sauce with green onions) but it was still very good. A fresher flavor, due to the sliced onions, bell peppers, and green onions that were mixed in, and not as caramelized or crispy a flavor but more subtle. It tasted more like a homemade version of Mongolian Beef which was a nice change. The veggies were all crisp and flavorful and the beef was tender.

The Szechuan Chicken had lots of veggies like baby corn and bell peppers and a spicy sauce. It was very nice too. Portions of meat to rice are generous and could satisfy a light appetite for two meals.

The fried rice is awesome, with tender grains of rice, lightly flavored and very fresh tasting and dotted with vegetables. No hard grains or weird textures which might be indicative of old rice being reused. Nothing we ate had the intense saltiness I usually associate with Chinese food, either, which was a wonderful plus.

The food was all tasty and the bill came to $16 including nominal delivery charges after our 15% discount coupon. $16 for lunch for three people, delivered? It's an absolute steal! The food is tastier and in bigger portions than most Chinese places, and I'll be ordering from them again and again. They have this ridiculously huge family feast thing for $33 that I have my eye on. I've been to NYC many, many times and thoroughly enjoy the high quality Chinese takeout one can get delivered there. I never thought I'd be able to get the same experience here in AZ, but with Gold Chef I can!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to take my grandkids for noodles and orange chicken, it turned out to be a big disappointment we left most of the food, uneaten on the table. The Moo Shu Pork was drowned in oil and soy sauce, and the Orange Chicken was gristly. The plain noodles were ok, not much flavor."}
{"text":"Read all the reviews and im still puzzled. I will let it be known that I do not necessarily know what NY style Chinese food is. 
I ordered several suggestions from yelp, but something is missing. It was good- maybe I just don't like Chinese food? Nothing spectacular. Minimum delivery price of $15 keep that in mind. 
Huge portions, quick delivery, above average. Not worthy of the stellar opinions though."}
{"text":"I've always called in my order and picked it up myself.  Never had delivery or dine in, which seems to be where most of the deductions on the reviews come from.

Tons of food, low prices, and it's ready within 15 minutes of my phone call.  I've been there 14 times so far and the order has always been right (knock on wood).  Is it the best Chinese in town?  Of course not, and for the price you're paying if you expect it to be then I'm sure you're the type to complain you don't have a Kobe beef steak for $15 at Black Angus either.

They stopped serving duck about a year ago because not enough people were ordering it and that's too bad since it was my favorite dish of theirs.  Personally I like the fact that the sweet & sour chicken is a ton of chicken in the box, no rice or filler stuff, just chicken.  After all, they give you an entire box of free white or brown rice on the side, so if you want to mix them together, then get to it!  

They have a Family Feast which is 5 full dinners, a house fried rice, sweet & sour chicken, 4 eggrolls, crab rangoons, won tons, soup, a TUB of sweet & sour sauce and all for $36.  My girlfriend and I are big eaters and we get 8 separate meals out of this over 2 1/2 days.  Works out to $4.50 a meal.

Again, I can't speak for their service in the restaurant or for how the delivery crews are.  I suggest calling in your order, then drive over and pick it up yourself.  Front desk ladies have always been very nice.

It's not sit down, 4 star restaurant quality, but for fast, good, low priced, large portions I've had no complaints in 14 tries.  I keep trying different area Chinese restaurants but keep coming back to this one and haven't been disappointed yet.  If you are expecting \"super hot\" or something exotic, then don't bother.  It's Americanized Chinese food and I'll keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I went in to order take out and the lady in the front was very cold and straight to the point and wanted to make zero accommodations for my take out order. I won't ever return there just based on her attitude I don't care how the food tastes, if I'm bringing you business the least you can do is be nice. She didn't even respond when I said \"thank you\" on my way out."}
{"text":"Ordered online. They arrived on time which I was pleased with. I paid online which included a tip. When the man arrived at my door he was fidgeting. He finally handed me $5. I had more than $7 change. Yet he continued to look down and fidget some more and I was confused. I just said alright well thank you. All of a sudden he pulls out the rest of my change and says \"oh thank you!\" He walks away. Seriously? I was already planning to give him an extra tip. Its only a couple of dollars but it's the morality of it that counts. But now they get a bad review! It's like a game to them. Also the food was average. Nothing special at all. I'll take my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Gold chef must have taken over new management because food quality has improved. The soups have great taste, the tofu and veggie platter is one I have had recently, and the veggies look and taste fresh, the sauce is flavorful and has the right combination of spices, if you don't like garlic I would suggest possibly asking for a milder sauce possibly? White rice, the white rice is fresh- smells and tastes good. The wait you may have during the weekend days is well worth the food. Many new options are on the menu as well, one I recommend is the salt and pepper pork chops. Very pleased."}
{"text":"Good food! Fast delivery! A little pricy but what Chinese take out isn't! I would order again!"}
{"text":"I will never ever eat from here again.  

The quality seems to have declined and the service is definitely below par from my previous experience.   

It wasn't the first time, but will definitely be  my last time eating food from Gold Chef. 
The prior experiences were fine and the food was good (not great), but in this last experience, it was a deal breaker.  I ordered delivery the vegetarian selection, eggplant and tofu with garlic sauce (something I've gotten before on more than one occasion).  When I received my food from delivery I received Chicken with eggplant in garlic sauce. Also, when I opened the container, I saw a large piece of chicken that had blue coloring on it.  I couldn't believe it!  I thought that was incredibly weird, and either way I wasn't going to eat it.  I thought it was a mistake so I called back to correct the error again asking for the Tofu and eggplant in garlic sauce.   They were very apologetic regarding the mistake and said they would deliver my order. 

When I got the food the delivery man said, \"the tofu is in a separate container and you just need to mix it with the other container.\"  I thought that was weird of him to say but honestly didn't think anything of it.  

When I opened the bag, I found the tofu in a separate container, deep fried and the other container had chicken and eggplant in garlic sauce.    It seemed as if they did not even make an effort to make the meal with the tofu and just sent me the same thing I previously got which i thought was a mistake but just flat out seems lazy. 
I called them again to let them know of their mistake again, but I never got an answer back. It just rang until an automated voice said to enter some code. 

I did used to enjoy eating from here, but after this experience and 'red flags' from the blue colored chicken I think I'll pass."}
{"text":"Love this place for delivery! The lady owner is always super friendly on the phone. My husband loves their sweet & sour chicken-- he's really picky on the the type of batter used and this place hits the spot. They also serve the sauce in a separate container when it's being delivered which is a plus.

Some of their dishes are a bit americanized. I ordered Shanghai style noodles once and was expecting the ultra thick, chewy noodle but got thinner chow mein style instead. But it was still hot & yummy so I can forgive it!

All in all, nice fresh chinese delivery with good prices and reliable delivery. A+"}
{"text":"Seasame chicken is tasty but needs more sauce. A little dry."}
{"text":"Decent, quick, inexpensive Chinese food option. Close to my house so I decided to give it a try. Great egg rolls! Honey chicken is the bomb! Good service, friendly people, will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"No, just NO! Went here for lunch a few days ago, it was gross! The sesame chicken was mushy and had NO flavor, the pork fried rice was sweet and the egg drop soup had no flavor either. Had to drench everything in soy sauce just for taste. I would never go back here!"}
{"text":"I have been using the delivery service forgot chef pretty much since I moved to Chandler. The food is pretty well priced and give you a lot and the delivery guys really nice and quick. Other than that I have no complaints"}
{"text":"Excellent food and fast delivery! Great service! My go-to Chinese place!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken lo mein and the Mongolian beef combination plates. Both come with fried rice, an egg roll, and two wontons. Delivered within a half hour and was very good. Egg rolls were nothing special but the lo mein was the best! Very happy all in all."}
{"text":"Well done and inexpensive. The food was tasty and the portions more than adequate. Tried them on Christmas Day and not dissapointed. Vegetables were very fresh. I will go back"}
{"text":"Biggest regret is moving to awahtukee I cant get my gold chef fix as often as I used to. This is totally a family run little restaurant and the owner is so freaking sweet. She always greets with a huge smile and makes the place fun to visit she has a great sense of humor... on to the food its well priced NY Style chinese food that I dare say is better than some local places that are actually in Ny. I have yet to order something off the menu that I didnt like its all so yummy.  When I buy a house I hope its next to Gold Chef!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this place often (I was there the day they opened ), but with Beijing only about 3 miles away, and closer to my house, it has probably been a couple of years or so since my last visit...I can only imagine the steady decline this place has taken since my last visit. The lady I remember was always very kind and accommodating...the lady I had today was rude and acted like my very presence was an inconvenience to her. I'm not sure if it was a different lady or if serving mediocre food over the last few years has started to catch up to her.

My first issue was with my son's Sprite...we ordered it, she brought it out and it was flat. Yes, it happens. No big deal...so when I asked her for something else, she tells me that their soda machine isn't working. My first thought was, \"why did you serve it to begin with? Did she just assume that because my son was young he wouldn't know the difference between good soda and flat soda?\" Whatever...I just asked if I could take it off and get water. Very annoyed at this point, she tells me she'll take care of it...she then brings out a canned Sprite. (That should have been what she did to begin with)

Despite what others have written, the food has gone downhill from when they first opened. My son's sesame chicken was obviously previously frozen...I'm sure that's standard, but once something has been frozen past a certain time it starts to take on a certain texture and taste. That was his chicken...I'm lucky his tastes aren't up to my standards because I wouldn't have been able to eat it. I got Mongolian beef, which used to be sautéed with onions to a nice \"crisp\" and served in a light sauce. Today it comes out soggy and limp, covered in a heavy \"gravy\". 

I'd love to say something positive about this place as I try to with all of my reviews, but I've got nothing. It was a terrible dining experience. Check out my review of Beijing and go there instead!!"}
{"text":"This place was disgusting to say the least. Everything had a very off taste to it like it was spoiled/stale. The rice looked a day or 2 old. We took one bite of the food and our server crushed a roach right next to our booth. Yep that was it we paid and left and went and got a burger else where. This only got a 1 star rating because I can't rate it a 0!"}
{"text":"Huge portions. Very quick service. We were slightly worried about being the only ones in the place, but the food was pretty tasty. I wouldn't say it's anything above average, but for the price it's worth it. My single complaint is the size of their cups. My water had to be refilled about 20 times during lunch. I felt bad, but also felt like I was drinking out of a child's cup. Lol. We'll be goin back and trying different things."}
{"text":"Good service....good taste and presentation of the food. Price is right. They let you substitute items for a reasonable upcharge. Over all I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Amazingly, I didn't think this would have any reviews since it still had it's Grand Opening sign out front. Oddly enough, everyone that also reviewed this place only has 1 review to their name. Maybe they made their account because they loved this place so much!?

Interesting story on this review. I wanted to get something to eat and I was texting everyone I knew to see if they wanted to meet up somewhere. Nobody responded. However, I was hungry and didn't feel like cooking. So I started driving home to go and look on Yelp for somewhere new to try. Upon my exit I saw a homeless lady and thought... what the hell, why not try a new place with someone new? I wanted company and I'm sure she'd like a meal. So, I turned around and asked her to join me for dinner, which she accepted. So with that said, this review is for both of us - Thanks April.

I got the Chicken with Garlic Sauce. April got the General Tso's Chicken. Portions were large enough that neither of us finished our meals. Food was good, but nothing ***spectacular***. Bottom line, would I go back? Absolutely.

The service was a little quirky. We were pretty much the only ones in there at first and we were asked every 2-3 minutes if we were doing OK. Not a big deal, but I am sure some would find that annoying. On the bright side, my lemonade was never more than half empty (and I drink like a camel at a watering hole).

As another Yelper mentioned, the egg rolls were good. In fact, I may venture to say that they were some of the best I've ever had. They tasted very natural - aka, very green. It was a nice welcome to having ones have mushy lettuce.

April gives the place a 4/5.
I give it a 4-4.5/5."}
{"text":"They are one block away and it took an hour and a half to get to us. We indicated that we were paying cash and when the deliverer brought us our food. He \"conveniently\" didn't have enough change ($28 total of $40). He had $3....This place is unprofessional and their practices are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Love this place. We've ordered delivery from here several times! Their food comes freshly made, piping hot and quick! It taste really good too. We love their orange chicken and chowmein! Great spot for some Chinese take out! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place was bomb.com. The Lo Mein was on point and so was the sesame chicken. I will definitely be recommending this place for some good Chinese. This is now my go to place. The down fall was the waitress, she was a little rude but I was wasn't bothered, my youngest left his marking of food all over the floor for her.. haha Will be coming back!"}

Gold Chef Waitress Went Out Of HER way to Really Make our visit Miserable. Disgusting service and attitude from our waitress. Never will we return there. She treated my family horribly. We didn't get the chance to taste our appetizers because she wouldn't stop the rude comments and service. We all got up and left. BTW,  table was dirty sticky and she wouldn't clean it.  I Only Put 1 Star Because I Had to"}
{"text":"\"New York Style\" is a term that is thrown around by a lot of mediocre Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix area.  I think half of the restaurants that use that term have never been to New York and don't know what real Americanized Chinese food tastes like. I think an even bigger percentage of the people on Yelp who claim to judge New York style Chinese food have never been to New York either.  Yeah, New York style isn't authentic Chinese food and it's never been authentic Chinese food. If you want chicken feet and other authentic items, go elsewhere because that's not New York style either. 

New York style Chinese food is an Americanized version of Cantonese food.  This place is the only Chinese restaurant in the Valley that can lay claim to New York style Chinese food. Trust me, as a New Yorker, I grew up ordering Chinese food down the street and this is the real deal. The egg rolls are the best I've had in the Valley and all the dishes have that great Cantonese flavor. Their seafood particularly their shrimp dishes are cooked perfectly; they are not overcooked so that their shrimp is rubbery yet they are seasoned well enough that it doesn't taste raw or uncooked.

If you want straight up New York style Chinese food...the kind you can get on Elizabeth street, come here."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and personable. They either have a good memory or I order from there too much because they always address me by my name when I call.

The food is on point, always prepared perfectly with a real authentic taste. 

I've been trying the whole menu with no disappointments so far. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just your average run of the mill Chinese restaurant. Nothing to amazing and nothing to horrible. Just average."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE.

Enormous portions, very reasonably priced.
Super-fast service.

Egg rolls are perfect (fresh on the inside, golden crispy on the outside)
Egg drop soup is perfect (very eggy, not a ton of extra ingredients)
Great flavors in their entrees (thick savory sauces, juicy chicken)

So happy that we've finally found our favorite Chandler Chinese place."}
{"text":"We thought the food was very good.  Delivery took a long time, but the food was good, so we weren't too worried about the delivery time."}
{"text":"VERY bland. Everything tasted the same. Nothing was 'bad' but I won't be back. We ordered two kids meals, orange chicken, sesame shrimp and some pot stickers (dumplings). It was about $50 with the tip for delivery. If the food had some flavor ... no problem. HOWEVER"}
{"text":"My go-to for take out and delivery for Chinese. Everything is tasty, and it has a very similar style to California Chinese food since that's where I'm from. It's not too greasy, great taste and staff are friendly. Delivery was prompt and great delivery deals."}
{"text":"Horrible service - use a different restaurant! 

I didn't have the opportunity to even try the food here. I placed my order, received a confirmation email that they were preparing it... And an hour later I received a call that they are going to cancel my order. 

If you can't fill orders, be up front with customers. Keeping us waiting around all night thinking our dinner is on its way is proof that this business has zero respect for its customers.

Jan 2016: I have ordered from this restaurant again and haven't had any additional service issues. The food is decent, about what you'd expect for the cost. Just your standard American Chinese food."}
{"text":"Always so kind and service is always quick! I'm always happy with the food! I haven't had a bad experience yet!!! There fried rice seems less greasy then other restaurants around I've been to, and I love that!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time Monday.  My fiance and I shared some sweet and sour chicken and rice.  I had some Crab Rangoon.  Unfortunately I had some food poisoning Monday night and Tuesday.  I'll pass on ever going here again."}
{"text":"One of Mr. M's coworkers was raving about the egg rolls from this place, so one afternoon after visiting the Halloween stores in the area we decided to stop in and try 'em out.  We also got an order of their salt and pepper calamari.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a friendly gentleman who asked us if this was our first visit.  He took our to-go order and then offered and brought us some water while we waited.  The egg rolls were very good and fresh and not greasy at all.  The calamari was exceptional with light tempura-style breading that was fresh, crispy, and also not greasy.  The peppers and onions provided a great grilled flavor and made us wish we had a couple of cold beers in hand to have with our very tasty appetizers. 

I brought up not greasy twice because it's typical that takeout Chinese places have good greasy food that goes great with adult beverages.  Gold Chef on the other hand is not greasy, but still goes well with adult beverages.  I look forward to going back and trying their full meals.  First visit was impressive."}
{"text":"Just found this place today, I was told it had been there for five years, and is currently under new management.  The food was really good, it reminded me of a Chinese place I used to frequent in Chicago.  Best part is they deliver within a 5 mile radius, so the next time will be delivery! I would recommend this place to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. Let me preface this with saying the lady owner, who took our order for take out was really, really friendly. Somehow the driver got the wrong address and went to the neighbors' house, but as luck would have it, I was outside and caught him. He was also super sweet.

Now, the food. We like our food HOT. HOT! Our gal had asked on a scale of 1-5 hot how did we like it. We said 10. We eat ghost peppers. We like it HOT. She laughed and said ok, no problem. The food came quickly (and we are a bit away). We ordered the sweet and sour pork, rangoon puffs, Hunan beef and shrimp and hot and sour soup. Sadly, the food was not good at all. Not terrible, but not good. When we order hot, we expect chili peppers to be used. They used chili oil in the Hunan dish and the hot and sour soup. It was SOOOO greasy I had to wash the lids off of everything because it was everywhere. And it was not hot AT ALL. The Hunan flavor of the dish would have been good, but it was SOAKED in oil. The hot and sour soup had so much grease, it was floating on top. And there was no meat in the soup. I am used to at least some beef and shrimp. Just tofu and mushrooms. It was thick, which I like, but I had to scrape the oil off the top. The rangoon puffs were tasty, but they came with no sauce. And the sweet and sour pork came with the fried pork in a container by itself, with the sauce on the side. Fine. I get that. They didn't want it mushy when it got here. I like that. But it was ONLY pork in the container. No peppers, no onions, no pineapple, just the pork. The rice was ok. But nothing to mix in with the pork.

I give this rating a 2 because the lady was EXTREMELY nice, and even called us back to apologize for the driver having the wrong address and stating she wanted to update their system so they had it right the next time. When she called, after we had eaten, we told her our food was NOT spicy at all, as promised, but said next time she would do better.

I will give them another chance because of their customer service and how lovely the lady was. But let's hope it doesn't come with a pound of oil in and on everything. I am so disappointed. I was excited to try this place. And it turned out to be like almost all of the Chinese restaurants in town.

Dear Golden Chef,
Please, please, please! Use peppers, NOT chili oil. And add something to your sweet and sour pork. Because the batter on the pork, and the pork itself was pretty tasty. And your customer service was so wonderful. 

:( :("}
{"text":"I've had a take out menu on my fridge for this place for two years at least but I never ordered from them because I'm lazy and I generally only order from a place if I can order online.  Anything to avoid that whole talking-to-a-real-person thing.

Anytime I try a new Chinese place I order all of my favorites at once just so I know if it's worth a second time around.

There were some highs and lows and in-betweens.

1. Wonton Egg Drop Soup - Nothing on any Chinese menu will ever be better than putting the two best soups in the world together.... unless you get it from Gold Chef.  I'm glad I only ordered the small because I didn't even finish that.  The wontons were fine, but the broth was so bland.  It was basically just egg water... I want you to sit and think about what egg water might taste like... you got a lock down in your mind on that? That's right.  Egg water.  It was really, really horrible.  Zero stars for the soup.

2.  Crab Puffs - These were fine.  Not any detectable crab, but they weren't over sweet like so many tend to be.  I would order these again.  

3.  Egg Rolls - A few people mentioned that there is no meat in these, but there most certainly was a noticeable amount of pork in mine.  So please, if you are a vegetarian or do not eat pork, this is NOT something you want to order.  Do not listen to the other reviews who say it's all vegetable.  That all being said, they are tasty.  Sufficiently crispy and flavorful with a good ratio of wrapper to filling.

4. Lemon Chicken - The chicken is breaded, not battered, which is a plus in my book.  The lemon sauce was also probably the best lemon sauce I've ever had.  I'm not sure everyone would agree, though.  It's very sweet and tastes almost like a lemon glaze for pies rather than something for a savory dish, but I thought it tasted awesome with the chicken.  This is gonna be a judgment call on if you think you'd like a sweeter sauce.  The chicken itself wasn't as dry as the breaded chicken tends to be in other places, so that was a bonus as well.

5. Singapore Mei Fun - No one ever has and probably ever will beat the PF Changs version of this dish (Singapore Street Noodles) but this one was decent.  The chicken and pork seemed a little dry and not very fresh, but the flavor was fine and the shrimp was cooked well.  I might have liked it just a touch spicier though.

Overall, everything was very good, but I just couldn't bring myself to give a 4 star rating because the soup was just THAT BAD.  The only way I'd order again is if I had a craving for something specific and didn't really want soup.  Sadly, I usually only order Chinese food when I have a soup craving specifically.  Such a shame that the most important component for me was the one horrible thing I got."}
{"text":"Nothing amazing in my opinion but good nonetheless. It's hard to find a 4/5 star Chinese delivery/takeout restaurant in this area in my opinion. But even though I am only rating this 3 stars it is one of the BETTER ones. For the price we payed we got a lot of food, we got enough food for a family but it was just two of us! They were very fast at completing our order which had me worried because a lot of these places that do Chinese food fast tend to lack on the small details that make it great but this place did it it good time and was pretty tasty. I'd recommend to someone that is looking to change up there Chinese take out spot, not a bad option."}
{"text":"This is the closest to NY Chinese food I have found in the area.  If you are from back east and miss good Chinese, give this place a try!  We have only gotten the delivery, but the service is great and the food even better!"}
{"text":"I got the garlic pork and my partner got the honey chicken to go. Pork was bland and had pieces of fat all over it. The honey chicken had some flavor to it but it wasn't great. We also got two sodas which were not mixed correctly. The portions (including soda) were big but I ate less than half my food and threw the rest away. The actual restaurant was bland and old looking. Table was sticky."}
{"text":"Great Chinese delivery. Prices are good, service is very friendly. It's as good or better than any other Chinese restaurant. Huge menu with plenty of options."}
{"text":"Pretty decent quick Chinese food place. If your craving Chinese skip Panda and come here."}
{"text":"Fast service and amazing food! had an order delivered to my home and I think its the best Chinese food I've had!"}
{"text":"Okay, i have good news :)  Very happy to say that the new owners of the Golf Chef are doing a much better job.  The new service staff and owner are very personable.  They check in on you to make sure everything is good.  The menu looks the same but I think they are using a better food supplier now and their ingredients seem to taste a little fresher.  Under the old owners, I think their chicken had a weird after taste, but not now.  

I will give it 3.5 stars now for this big improvement, and I will need to go back another time to taste the dishes and soups.  I had hot and sour soup during my recent visit and It was neither too hot or sour and had tasted sweeter than it should be.  I had chicken egg foo young and it was decent.  So maybe the next time when I come back and they have semi hot and semi sour soup, I can upgrade them to 4 stars J  I am still very happy that at least this place is a decent enough place for lunch and its close to the office for now."}
{"text":"This place was great! I saw the prior reviews but needed somewhere that delivered so I went with it. I was SO pleasantly surprised! The people were very nice on the phone and the delivery was the fastest I have ever had. It was quicker then pizza. Portions were great and my whole family was happy. This will be our new mom is tired go to place for dinner"}
{"text":"Ok gang, we just left this place & hurried our goody bag home. FINALLY! What more can I say? Chandler finally has a really good chinese restaurant. They cook your food to order in no time. More importantly...you can recognize the ingredients in your food & it taste great. This is where my gf & I will go when we're jonesing for chinese food.

3/8/15
This use to be a great place for good & quick Chinese food. Over the years, the service has gone down, the food quality is garbage & the prices are ridiculous. We'll drive across town before we eat here again."}
{"text":"One of the better Americanized/NY style chinese food.  Prices are very reasonable. They have lunch specials 7 days a week until 3pm that are in the $5 (give or take) range. I usually get the Honey Chicken lunch. Lunch specials includes a smaller portion of the entree with fried rice and an eggroll. The \"smaller portion\" is plentiful for a meal and then some. The fried rice is tasty and the eggroll is better than what I expected. The shrimp eggrolls are blah though... mainly cabbage with two tiny pieces of shrimps, like popcorn shrimp size. On the contrary, their shrimp entrees come with large size shrimps."}
{"text":"OMG, how did this place rate 4 stars.  Went last night and the food was bland and terrible.  Both of us threw out half our dinner, inedible.  The breaded chicken for the sesame chicken, C13, and Gen Tso's Chicken, C12, had so much fat and skin mixed with what was presumably chicken meat of some sort (definitely not white meat) that it was actually worse then a chicken mcnugget.  Just a gummy blob with a bland sauce with a hint of \"hot\" for the Tso.  The pork fried rice was also quite bland with an off taste.  The egg roll was decent though.  The little fried wonton pieces tasted like they were cooked in oil that was WAY past it's prime and were also stale tasting.  The broccoli perched on top of the entre tasted old and tough. This was at 7 pm on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Ordered online at 6.05 it's now 7.55 and still has not arrived.  Rang twice to check on progress, woman was no help.  Could not even tell me when it would arrive and then hung up on me!!!  Don't bother ordering.  

After a further 3 calls to the restaurant they claimed to call the driver and he was out the front. After another call the lady on the other end claimed they never got the order and told me I should follow with Beyond Menus. So I called Beyond Menus and they claimed to have confirmation from Gold Chef and I should follow up with them. 

So I called Gold Chef and added them to the call with Beyond Menu. Again the rude lady at Gold Chef claimed they never got the order but the guy from Beyond Menus presses and the rude lady at Gold Chef claimed it was the Delivery drivers fault and she could not check if she had gotten the fax because the drivers take them and they are all out on deliveries.

Hence I cancelled the order, pity it will take 48 hour for the refund from Beyond Menus when it only took a couple of minutes for the charge to be processed.

I would never use or recommend Gold Chef or Beyond Menus again after my first experience."}
{"text":"I went to Gold Chef for the first time a few days ago and my first impression of this place was that it was pretty quiet and empty. The lady was very nice and accommodating and was very nice and kind. When the food came out I did not realize that the portions were so huge. 
My stomach had a problem with the chicken that was cooked even though it was so delicious! 
We are not sure if we will be back for a while."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place many times on the way to Walmart before finally tried it. The owners are so friendly. We heard the lady joking and greeting the old customers by names while eating there :) I had Mongolian beef, it's tender and tasty. Tried others' order of Kung Pao chicken and sweet & sour pork. Everything tastes great and very fresh. Would definitely recommend it for Chinese fast food or take out. Oh almost forgot to mention, I tried their iced coffee, wow I was so happily surprised. I'll stop by again for sure :D"}
{"text":"Worst place noodle are dry, fried rice looks like just rice with soy sauce!!! Orange chicken looks nasty taste is nasty!! I'm from California and I have not found d the right place out here!!"}
{"text":"Gold Chef's curry shrimp is absolutely delicious. It's loaded with onions, bell pepper, carrots, water chestnuts and potatoes, all simmered in perfectly blended, rich curry sauce. I added mushrooms to mine, because I'm obsessed with them.

The restaurant is clean, well-appointed, and intimately lit. The woman with the asymetrical cut is always pleasant and a joy to deal with, and she's prompt and courteous as well.

If you're in the Chandler area, and you're looking for good Asian food with fair prices, Gold Chef is it...far better than P.F. Chang's and a million times better than that bland tasting Panda Express."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place in town. Quick, cheap, and tons of food! Even amazing tofu! Definitely going to be our \"go to\" place from here on! Food tastes amazing!!  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"For our delivery they said 35 minutes, which turned into 103 minutes before we got our food. The owner was apologetic, and recooked and delivered our order.   He said they have a new delivery person who got lost.  

Thankfully the food tasted good.  So they regained a star with that.  I am not sure if we will try this location again after the long wait...  even though the food was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I will start with the good.  The staff on the phone is very nice and the delivery guys are fast and courteous.  The dumplings were great and that is my test of good Chinese food.  Other than that I don't have much good to say.  The food was bland, bland, bland and given the other reviews I was surprised.  Overall not terrible, but I probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Having been here several times since my first visit a few years ago, I have to say the food here is not as good as it originally seemed. It's not bad, but definitely not Pei Wei. If they served optional brown rice and had something better to drink than Gold Peak Tea I might give it another star."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall,  favorite of my brother so off we went.

Several tables seated and quite the line for take out but gal said \"wherever\" so we sat and quickly ordered.  He ordered Black Pepper Chicken with broccoli (not on the menu by the way) and I the House Special Pad Thai.  

Food was out in a flash and a large portion. Very hot ( temperature ) and delicious. The House Pad Thai indicated it was spicy but there was no spice at all but IT WAS DELICIOUS as well as the Black Pepper Chicken.  Drinks were refilled several times without asking and the steady stream of people for take-out was pretty constant. 

Then I received the bill..UNDER $20!?  WOW and enough for lunch tomorrow-bonus!

My brother stated the service was pretty good this evening. .better than most. .for me,  makes it a pretty good evening!"}
{"text":"I'd rate this 4.5 stars if I could. We shared two lunch specials that were very good especially for the price. First order was sweet and sour pork. Second order was shrimp egg foo young. Both came with fried rice, 1 crab puff and 1 egg roll included in the price.  

The pork was a bit over breaded for me but the taste was very good. Nice sauce just wish there were a few more veggies to go along with it.

The shrimp egg foo young stole the show. Meal came with two large patties that were thick yet fluffy and I had shrimp in every bite!!!! One of the best EFY's I've ever had. Their brown gravy was a bit gelatinous but still tasty. 

Overall cost was $14 for so much food that was very good quality. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I eat at this place all the time! Good food and not over-priced. I recommend the mongolian beef, general tso chicken, or vegetables in garlic sauce."}
{"text":"The food is good and not expensive. Found this place when we moved to Az 2 years ago and still come back when we're in town. I order to go and husband picks up on his way home from work. We live 40 minutes away and rather have Chinese from here than our local Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get Chicken and Broccoli as close to home (New Jersey) as possible. Pricing is not bad either. I recommend trying it."}
{"text":"1st let me say, that almost every time I've ordered Chinese delivery / take out, I'm frustrated by the service / courtesy I get on the other end of the phone.  Not this time.  The lady who answered was very sweet and helpful.  

The food was fresh, I highly recommend the beef on a stick & the Mongolian beef w/ fried rice.  The crab puffs were also tasty and the delivery was prompt as well.

It's not Benihana, but it was the best delivered Chinese food we've had since moving here, so give them a shot!"}
{"text":"I'm very particular when it comes to the way my meat is cooked in Chinese food. Must say Gold Chef gets it right every time. Food is very delicious and delivers in a very timely manner."}
{"text":"Delicious fast food & very large portion on the lunch menu.  We are new to the neighborhood, and decided to give it a try. I ordered the garlic chicken, and he had the general tsao chicken lunch specials.  Soup to start, a crab puff, and spring roll are served with lunch specials.  Very fresh veggies & all white meat chicken are a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"You don't even know how much I love this place.  My husband found it one day while driving around looking for places to eat lunch and took me there a few weeks later.  Lavinia is amazing and her memory boggles my mind!  The newer staff is very friendly.  But oh the food.  THE FOOD!  I have never had more delicious Pan Fried Crispy Noodles in my LIFE.  My husband lives and dies by their Hot and Sour Soup.  And they do alternate whether the wonton soup is in beef or chicken broth (and personally I prefer the beef version), but it's still pretty awesome.  We used to live close enough that they'd deliver, so we'd either dine in, take out, or have it delivered at least once a month.  The closest I got to a bad experience was in the early days when I was still figuring out what to eat.  I once got some weird version of Szechuan chicken, the dish was too spicy or not spicy enough, etc. Once I found a dish that nobody else could make like they did (PAN. FRIED. CRISPY. NOODLES), It's been the exact same order since.  When we moved out to San Tan Valley, we had to put this stop on our route going home every few months.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"I found this place through take out and love it. Really fresh ingredients and lots of vegan options."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order from Gold Chef whenever we want Chinese take out. It's pretty good and really quick delivery! We've gotten the Sweet & Sour Chicken, General Tso's, Pork Fried Rice, Steamed Dumplings and Egg Rolls...all which have been really yummy :)"}
{"text":"We're regular.  Singapore noodles and Beijing beef are the best. If you ask, they will suggest some authentic recipes. We tried tofu, chicken hot pot, very delicious."}
{"text":"I love the place, cheap prices, yet fresh food.  Tasty chicken and broccoli"}
{"text":"I usually look at both sides of the table and I have to say I like skepticism. So with that said I like what Lester had to say. I don't necessarily agree that quantity and good quality control equal fabulous food. Taste is the biggest factor as well and something you need to take into consideration. We blew in here with the storm and the lady said hello and seated us in the small restaurant seating area. 

This place is surprisingly a sit down server restaurant, even though it looks like a fast food type place. I ordered the vegetable lo-mein and the other diner with me ordered the beef with broccoli. For the price you do get a good portion size of lo-mein and beef. My dish was pretty spicy so there was no need to ask them to make it extra spicy. I detected a hint of spam essence in the noodle which turned me a little off of the dish. The other diner's food was also pretty spicy so if you are sensitive just make sure you ask them to not make your dish so spicy.

The shopkeeper was very polite and came by ever so frequently to make sure that we were doing okay. Although I would not say this is the best ever, I will return to try something else and because the food and service is worth a second chance. They do delivery!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Grub Hub fully expecting the food to show up past the estimated  time. Much to my surprise it showed up 45 minutes early steaming hot. 

The food itself was delicious and not overly soaked in the usual sauces. Crab puffs were not soggy at all and the filling was one of the best I have had recently. 

I would most definitely order from this place again."}
{"text":"5 stars for the great customer service! We have been here twice and the food is really good. I always get the hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"Large portions, great take-out and delivery service.  Love the Kung-Pao and the S&S Chicken."}
{"text":"This place has great fried rice. Egg drop soup is to die for. I travel alot and now other Chinese food place just don't cut it anymore"}
{"text":"We eat there about twice a month. Food is always hot and delicious! 
Owners are friendly and call us by name.  Place is clean and service is excellent.

 we get thin noodles wtih pork shrimp chicken, etc. and egg rolls and beef on a stick.   I always order mine extra spicy and its TO DIE FOR.
always excellent taste!
this place is the NICKELBACK of Chinese restaraunts:)"}
{"text":"First off I will not waste my time trying this place the food was horrible and the service was even horrible don't waste your time"}
{"text":"They have the best lunch specials! Huge portions and low prices. The employees are always friendly. The best deal on Chinese food around."}
{"text":"A badass hole in the wall joint.

I come here and order from here every so often. I should have left a review sooner honestly. The food is great for the price. I can honestly say that the price is what has always sold me. I'm a cheap guy that tries or pretends to be on a budget most of the time. 

Customer service is pretty good. They deliver to you right off of the Yelp app, which is neat. I think its super convenient for a business to offer that, without having to download a separate app or order from their website. Gold Chef has synced it with Yelp, so ordering delivery or take out is a breeze.

The orange chicken is my typical cliche way to go. Its a ton of food, and they don't go easy on the chicken. Its alot of rice and chicken (seriously). 

Food: 4/5
Price 5/5
Customer service 5/5
Restaurant cleanliness 4/5

I'll be back to try and get this to 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"We've ordered here before....
This time it took an hour and a half. They are a block away. 
When I called the woman said 'Your food has already gone a long time ago' or something to that extent, and said there was nothing she could do about it. She also said when I called 30m earlier that the food was on its way.
Ordered at about 6:40, it is 8:06 now. My girlfriend is a teacher and needs to be in bed soon and we haven't eaten.

To any readers...calling doesn't seem to help either."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Delivery came 15 min late and when I called the restaurant to ask about when we could expect our food, the person who answered was rude. I'll never order from this place again.  The only reason I tried Gold Chef was because I didn't want to change out of pajamas to go to Yao. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever - bland and tasteless. Had delivery but was missing egg rolls. When I informed them of it they argued with me! The bbq was the only item with flavor but the meat was way too fatty to the point of being gross. Do not recommend this place. A frozen dinner has more appeal."}
{"text":"The food was ok not sure if new cooks came with new management. When they first opened the food was a lit better and the store was busier."}
{"text":"We have been searching for good Chinese food in Chandler for many years, and have not found consistently good, flavorful food that is fresh.  Based upon some of the previous reviews, we decided to give this restaurant a try.  We called in and picked up an order of Triple Delight and Kung Pao Chicken with brown rice.  This is, by far, the worst Chinese food we have ever had.  The rice was sticky and starchy.  Both dishes were not only greasy, but downright oily- the meat was slick and mushy.  Eww.....  The flavors of the sauces were almost identical- the exception being a tad of spice in the kung pao.  I would not recommend this for the family dog, let alone for human consumption.  Our search continues......."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite new Chinese delivery place. They got a huge menu and i have not found single thing that doesn't taste amazing or amaze the person we ordered for."}
{"text":"Ordered take out ! Big portions and very satisfied with the food. It was fresh and didn't take too long . We almost ordered delivery but decided to head in good choice if you are ordering delivery it doesn't specify that all entrees come with a side of rice ! You can replace with veggies or lo mein for an upcharge :)"}
{"text":"If you want really good Chinese food delivered super fast to your house this is the place. Their service is excellent and each meal tasty. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the high salt or MSG content - I'm not sure which."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews that the lady is very nice. I placed the order & waited, didn't take long at all. I ordered a egg roll, crab puffs and general tso chicken. The crab puffs were good, chicken was soggy and really had no flavor, the egg roll had fresh vegetables but really no taste also. There rice was really good but I will not return most likely."}
{"text":"The waitress was friendly the restaurant was very clean, food was out quick, hot and sour soup was very good, spring roll tasted store bought, crab puff was very good, kung pao chicken was very good asked for extra spicy and was exactly what I ordered. Lunch specials start at $5.25 overall I was very pleased will be back again"}
{"text":"I have never actually set foot inside this restaurant, but they deliver via the Grub Hub app, so we've ordered from them many times. 

The General Tao Beef is probably my favorite thing, though the lemon chicken is also lovely. Beef and broccoli is good, but basically on a par with other places. 

They are super-fast with delivery! The Grub Hub app usually tells me that it'll be 60-70 minutes (probably covering their butts), but it's usually closer to 15 or 20 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're looking for delivery of Chinese food there decently quick if you download a food delivery app there's usually coupons on there to save you money. The stuff is pretty nice I wouldn't say it's anything extraordinary but it is quality food."}
{"text":"The biggest issue is that the food certainly is not fresh. Plus, there is too much of sodium and MSG. Enough, to upset your stomach. If you can ignore what you put in your mouth, this place might be for you. You are likely to be disappointed unless quantity and price is on top of our list.."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We called for delivery.  The food arrived piping hot and tasted delicious! Sesame chicken, fried rice, look mein and some of the best hot and sour soup that I've ever had! We'll definitely be ordering from there again!"}
{"text":"We decided to give Gold Chef a try based on yelp reviews. 
The egg rolls were...eh...they didn't have any pork or chicken in them and they're quite oily on the inside.The crab ragoons were perfect!! We shared the orange chicken and sweet and sour pork with fried rice. The two entrees were delicious! Although the fried rice was plain; no veggies or egg, I didn't realize they had more than one kind and they charge you $2 extra for it. All in all it was a positive experience and we would definitely come back but next time we'll just have the ragoons and share an entree since it was too much food."}
{"text":"fast, good food.  Easy to order on EAT24"}
{"text":"Small place in a (Walmart) strip mall setting. Very casual dine in...express , not fast food but far from \"fine dining\".  Service relatively slow for such a small place and not overly warm.  I had the Mongolian Beef combination plate with won ton soup substituted for egg roll.  Food as surprisingly good, with nice spicing to the Mongolian Beef.  Good satisfying meal, as I was hungry..not great but better than most similar small Chinese Express spots!"}
{"text":"Everything was awesome. I had veg lo mein, pork and shrimp rolls, calamari and pan fried dumplings. Food was hot and delicious. Big portions. Calamari has a light breading and was pretty tender. I would recommend getting the peppers that come with it separate to prevent sogginess."}
{"text":"This food was amazing!!! Ordered vegetable lo-mein and tofu with vegetables!!!! Delivery was fast and friendly! Will definitely order again!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife absolutely love Golf Chef, when we first moved in across the street we were skeptical of going into any new Chinese restaurant. That was quickly changed when we walked in and were greeted by who I believe is the owner a slightly younger women. She was very happy to see us and took our order promptly and even made a joke during the order in which we all had a laugh. This was just over two years ago and we have been going back or ordering out ever since. The food personally to me is quality and I enjoy the Coconut Chicken the most. My wife enjoys Sweet & Sour Pork and we always get crab puffs, egg drop soup, steamed dumplings you name it we've ordered it for the most part. We have had friends over and ordered large meals and service was prompt and delivered fast, mind you they are across the street from us but still. We would order sometimes for 4-5 people and it would still arrive within 30 minutes usually which is great service I feel for such a big order. Over all Gold Chef is a nice little gem next to Sweet Daddy's Cupcakes. I haven't had the Yelp app all that long so I don't have pictures at the moment to upload but I will upload some soon."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had the Kung Pao chicken lunch special! Really good and flavorful and at a very good price. Would come back here again."}
{"text":"Definitely a good option when it come to Chinese food. I wouldn't say it's the best, however I might just be spoiled to the options in my hometown. It does however satisfy my cravings and the portions are huge. #leftovers Absolutely will be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Friday. 

Lunch specials are $5.95 ( not including tax). Many special you can view prior from their outside window display.

If dining in - you'll receive a complementary small cup of Hot & Sour soup along with a small bowl of fried wontons and sweet & sour sauce. Drink is also included in the meal.

I had the General Tso chicken recommended by the server. It was delicious. A light battered tempura- fried chunks of chicken in a sweet spicy sauce. The sauce was really good! I would have preferred noodles over rice, rice wasn't anything special like a Chinese Fried Rice should be. Also, with the meal I was given an egg roll and a cream cheese wonton. Great deal for a good meal.

In speaking with the waitress, they do get a lot of take out orders. In fact, during the time I was there two people came in to pick up their order and they had an employee that was out delivering. I was the only patron dining in. Location is busy with their deliveries and to go offers. Dining indoors are busier in the evenings and on the weekend.

I really appreciated the fresh quality of the food, made to order. Service was fast and friendly. Prices were outstanding for portion size and all that's included."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some quick and tasty take-out, golden chef is the way to go!! I like their garlic chicken, kung pao chicken and black pepper chicken. 

I eat here most days as I work nearby, and it's by far the best value. Lunch special is $6 and some change, full dinner is less than $10. Can't beat that!

Try it out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over a year now. It's definitely one of our go to cheap yummy fresh Chinese joints! It's small but quite. Prices are decent for the amount of food you get. Lil Asian lady is sweet every time we come. I say if you want to have something not to heavy and not too expensive give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Gold Chef is the best  Asian restaurant in the  Valley. They have great food and  always  fresh.  Their spring and scrimp rolls are top  notch. With such a  affordable price, the food and great  service  is definitely worth it. There is no other  Chinese  restaurant in the  Valley like it. And I recommend it to anyone  looking for  great food, and  service a affordable price. Kevin McCombs"}
{"text":"As usual they did not disappoint.  They're Ma Pao Tofu is awesome.  In my opinion.  
My husband loves there sweet and sour chicken.  As well as there egg foo young. The patties are thick and very moist not dried out. 
They also have a great kids meal for the littles that don't like Chinese food.  We've always ordered to go. Pick up is fast. Delivery takes about 30 minutes.  Depending on your order. 

I really love there food.  And the owner is also really nice."}
{"text":"I ate there twice,  I ordered two different things both times and did not like either!"}
{"text":"I ordered the General Tso's chicken during the lunch special. 

It was only $5.95 it came with fried rice, a side of soup, an egg roll and a wonton. 

It was a good sized meal, you definitely get more than your money's worth.

The food was tasty and I would come back again for the great deal and good food."}
{"text":"Meh...it's pretty decent food and all but there is better to be had in this area. The people were fairly friendly but could care less about being very personable and having a conversation.

The biggest issue with this place was how disgusting the bathroom was. Made me with I hadn't  closed the door behind me! So gross. Hasn't been cleaned in at least a year or two. I can imagine the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Loved the food. We had the chicken fried rice ,lo mein, and egg rolls. Everything was tasty and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered through Grub Hub ahead of time and they were even earlier! 

I think this place beats our go to of Beijing...

PROS
-Walnut shrimp - super tasty and good amount walnuts..even came with some steamed broccoli. The broccoli was not mushy at all! 
-Tasty hot and sour soup, came with standard fried wontons
-crabpuffs were good, cheaper than most places, 8 per order
-Chinese eggplant - lots of veggie goodness, chestnuts, carrots, mushrooms, celery, sauce was not spicy but still very flavorful
-spicy mongolian beef - it had a very mild spice, good  saucybeef and scallions


The pork rolls were just standard eggrolls, a little bummed as we are used to them being a little more hefty."}
{"text":"We placed a large delivery order for the first time last week to try this place out. The delivery was on time, and the orders perfect. The problem was that food was super boring and bland. We ordered spicy meats that didn't have any zip. Just wasn't good enough for us to try again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed ! First time costumer- ordered online and it took 70 minutes to be delivered and I live 6 minutes from the restaurant

Called and the lady was rude and short when asking how much longer I had to wait. 

Overpriced and not even very good- ."}
{"text":"Have to say this was the best Chinese food I've had in years.  We had the lunch which was hot, fresh and very very good.  Restrooms were clean restrurant was clean and help was very friendly.   Lunch specials started $5.25. We did not go away hungry."}
{"text":"It's always nice to find a good delivery food place. This was the first time I have eaten gold chef, it was recommended by a friends who's food preference I trust. We ordered an order of orange chicken, chicken lo mein, crab ragoons and chose the fried rice as opposed to the white rice. The total was $23.00 for all of this food, this fed javier and I and we both were able to take leftovers for lunch. Delivery time was told would be 45 mins, it was actually only 15-20 minutes. Javier said he usually doesn't like orange chicken because too dry, this orange chicken was perfect, just enough sauce and a great flavor, they pack it with some fresh broccoli. Also I loved the chicken lo mein, it had lots of garlic flavor , one of the best lo meins I have had. The crab ragoons were ok, nothing special, would have liked to see some imitation crab in the mix. The only thing I can say I didn't care for was the fried rice, this was too dry and greasy.  We will be ordering from this place again for those nights I don't feel like cooking or when we get together last minute."}
{"text":"I've been craving Chinese not just regular chinese food the good kind.  Man oh man let's just say my pregnant belly is happy and they delivered straight to my apartment too !! Husband is happy too their chow mein  is to die for"}
{"text":"Great meal! We ordered barbeque beef sticks, egg rolls, beef low mien and orange chicken. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised- food was very good, not greasy and seasoned well.  We originally asked for spring rolls and the waitress said that they didn't have any tonight.  :-(  It was 5:23pm when we ordered. They had a fair amount of take out diners. We were the only dine in customers.   My husband asked for lemon for our ice tea and we got 1 slice! Really? So we split the slice in half and didn't bother to ask for more.   Gave 5 stars for food- this will be our new go to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I am only giving this place one star bc of the good service - if I were to only rate the food it would get zero stars! This place is gross!!! The nastiest Chinese food I have ever eaten, and I would consider my Chinese taste buds pretty accurate (Asian food lover). Save your money and your stomach and do not eat here."}
{"text":"Really, this should be 2.5 stars. 

Right before I ate the food I was going to give this business 1 star....here's my story.

I have been craving Chinese food and since I have an hour for lunch (I work right down the street) I figured I'd use my handy dandy Yelp app to find a good Chinese place. Well, this place popped up and the reviews seemed good, so I figured I'd give it a whirl. 

When I walked in, I was greeted by a lady that said, \"How can I help you?\" I responded with, \"Well, I'd like to place an order...\" In looking at the lunch menu, it didn't seem like there were many options for vegetarians except tofu w/ mixed vegetables and tofu w/ broccoli. BORING! So I asked, \"Is there a way to have Szechuan tofu instead of beef?\" She replied, \"No.\" I was like, \"You can't substitute tofu for beef?\" \"No.\" Kind of annoyed, I said, \"Ok, I'll have tofu w/ mixed vegetables.\" Then I noticed that the lunch special comes with pork fried rice so I asked if I could have veggie fried rice w/o the egg. She told me that it would be extra. Extra?!?!?! You're going to charge me to take OUT things? That's dumb. So I told her that I just wanted the tofu with vegetables....not the lunch special. She then said, \"Well, we have tofu with eggplant in a garlic sauce....a lot of vegetarians order that. So I said that it would be fine. I was quoted a 10 min. timeframe. I asked if I could eat there and she said that it would be fine.

I went and sat in a booth, which was broken. I leaned back  on the back rest and it pushed against the person behind me. That's kind of annoying. 

The waitress then brought me some water with lemon, which wasn't filtered water...it was just normal Chandler city tap water which tasted awful. Good thing I got lemon to kill the awful taste. 

My food then came out 15 minutes later (I timed it). I must say that the portion was plentiful and it was delicious! I was going to give this a 1 star review but since the food was really good I bumped it up a few. I'll give this place another try and see if they're still going to charge me extra to take things out of their fried rice. I honestly think the woman working was new and wasn't familiar with things.....we'll see."}
{"text":"We did delivery, and it was not good at all! All meat was very dry and greasy, even white rice was not good. Would not recommend this place at all : ("}
{"text":"I ordered online for delivery. It said it could take up to 45 min. It was at my house in maybe 20. It was delicious and hot. The delivery man was very nice as well. I was very happy with my service and food."}
{"text":"I do love this place. They do my favorite food here, mei fun, and they do it REALLY well. The soup is delicious too! And it comes out pretty fast, which is always a plus."}
