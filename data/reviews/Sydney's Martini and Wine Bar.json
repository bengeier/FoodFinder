{"text":"Very nice place. The staff was fun and gave great service. The atmosphere had a nice vibe. The food was great as well."}
{"text":"Nice staff. However, how are you a martini bar but you ran out of olive juice...AND you also ran out of martini glasses? Didn't satisfy my craving of a classic dirty martini."}
{"text":"The Best Party!
We had a surprise birthday party for my wife at Sydney's. It was such a hit! The surprise came off well with the help of her girlfriends, but planning the party with the staff at Sydney's was a snap. They took great care of me when I told them of my intentions, and offered great suggestions. When it finally happened, our guest were so impressed! Man, they gave me props for putting together such a great party. It was EASY! I picked the right venue!
Sydney's prepared Hors d'Oveures (great meatballs, great chicken wings, and spinach dip), and we had wine for the guests; they could also order cocktails from the wait staff or bar. We had the surprise about 8:30, the guests came about 7:30, and we had the \"house\" music playing. At 9:00 PM, the live band started and the party was on!

So, like I said, I was getting credit for such a great party. To throw a great party, you need a few basic things:
1. Great location. The way cool Uptown spot was large enough to make us comfortable, but not so large our guests were lost. Sydney's is always one of the coolest spots to visit. It was great for the party.
2. Great food. The hors d'oeuvres were on point-tastey and filling.
3. Great drinks - The bar kept the folks happy, and the wine didn't cost us an arm and leg for 30+ people.
4. Great music. From the time we got there, the music was nice, but when the band started, the party was ON! People danced and had a great time.
5. Great friends. This is all I had to provide, was the friends! I got the people together, and Sydney's staff did the rest. Kennedy (owner) was gracious and made sure we were well taken care of. They made me look good, but most importantly, my wife had a great birthday celebration.

We really like this club for adult fun. Way cool crowd, location, music, food, you can't go wrong.
Thanks Sydney's!"}
{"text":"Flatbreads are very good and so are the martinis,  especially the one with the coconut rum added. Tuesday evenings are something special featuring Conversation & Cocktails from 7 - 10pm. It's an exciting,  sexy and definitely grown, group dialogue about the quirky side of relationships. It is hosted by Fly Ty of v101.9 and Jacinda Garabito of WCCB News. The Relationship Coach on board is Dr. Susan Flowers and on the turntable bringing a splash of fun to this eclectic mix,  DJ Crazy T."}
{"text":"My wife and I made our first today after work. We really enjoyed the jazz ensemble and the decor! I feel as though that management left the bartender out there to fail. He was the ONLY one behind the bar with 17 orders and counting were stacking up!! We'll give this place another try in a few weeks to allow them to get the kinks out! It can be a really great spot to bring family and friends to! Much success!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, drinks, and food. The chicken quesadilla is delicious and the truffletini is my FAV! However, I wish there was more seating (tables and chairs) instead of those bulky couches. And as much as I love the live jazz bands, the music is entirely WAY TOO loud. The venue itself isn't particularly large, so there's really no need for the amps to be blasting because the musicians play their instruments so people can hear anyway. The speakers could definitely afford to be turned down a tad or two."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Sydney's was on a Wednesday after a Hornet's game around 10 pm. I entered into an attractive crowd both men and women with a great band performing! (Ladies, you should have seen these guys in the band!) um. The drinks were nice and strong and the service was prompt. I was pleasantly surprised as I've been in search of a grown and sexy environment since my recent relocation to Charlotte two months ago. 

So my husband I decided to visit Sydney's again on a Friday night and again it was a great night. Another great jazz band. Beautiful well dressed couples and lots of eye candy for the singles. You can't go wrong here. I believe they have a DJ that starts after the band around midnight.

As far as food is concerned. Everything that came out looked pretty tasty. I only had the shrimp cocktail which could have been presented in a better manner but I am a snob when it comes to food presentation. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon for 20.00, waiter charged us 27% gratuity for two people. We was in a hurry, but called the next day manager said he would refund us, but we both notice the waiter did not leave a receipt. Business was a little slow because of the protesters so I guess they was trying to get over, but never again. Just make sure you calculate the tax and gratuity before  you leave.. however the band was great this happened on Wed Sept 28th 2016"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times the service has been perfect...for lack of a better word.  Our bartender Nicole accommodated us with martinis not on the menu, but  rather catered to exactly what we wanted. Nicole, GM, was extraordinarily fantastic both times I was here.  I look forward to frequenting this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"Took about 45 minutes to receive a salad and spinach dip with nachos. When the spinach dip came it was watery. They did decide to take half off the bill. My friend did order something else in the place of the dip. Took another 1 hour for a barbecue salad."}
{"text":"I visit Sydney's on June 2017 and was truly dissatisfied and disappointed. A co-worker had suggested Sydney's for a girls night out  prior to going  I researched there website and was pleased to see they had over 15 different selections of martini's and food, called and verified if we needed a reservation (was told we didn't). We arrive at 8pm  the hostess ask if we had a reservation I informed her that we didn't because we were going to sit at the bar. Needless to say we weren't allowed to sit at the bar nor up front near the band she placed us in the back by the entrance we stood out like a sore thumb. Trying to make the best of the night we waited for a waitress which took like 15 mins, the menu was water down to 5 food options and half of the drinks weren't available. I asked the waitress in a joking way  \"where is the rest of the menu\"  she said 'this is it\" I couldn't take it any longer I  ask to speak with a manger, and got a fresh out of college pre-madonna. I informed her that the website didn't  match there menu selection and the website is why I came to Sydney's she was like \"I know, we haven't updated the website sorry for the inconvenience\" my co-worker kindly explain to her either you should correct the website or take it down because its false advertisement, and she asked way can't we sit at the bar  \"oh that area along with the front is for reservations only\"  she says. My co-worker and I informed her \"you know it's pretty empty in here to be 8:45pm\" At this point we are so ready to go I ask if my parking card could be validated we were told \"NO\" because we didn't make a purchase. I will never ever step foot in Sydney's."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.   It took me at least 30 minutes to get my drinks.  I ordered chicken nachos at 7:45 at 8:45 I canceled my order because it still had not arrived.   Pricey drinks. No never again.   Never!!! If I could give a negative star I would."}
{"text":"I loved this place for the awesome live music and I did enjoy my drinks. Service was excellent! Great date night! However, the food was a disappointment.  It wasn't totally horrible but not great either. I liked the buffalo dip and my ok tasting wrap both came with all these tortilla chips!!! No other side or dipper options. They just used these little round tortilla chips. Reminded me of the cheap off brand kind my grandma might buy. We paid a lot of money at the end of the night because we both had a few drinks, a couple appetizers and an \"entree\" for each of us but half the food was a ton of these chips. Please God somebody improve the food menu and options. Maybe a nice crispy french fry, sweet potato tot, fruit or something as the entree side with pita bread and/or sliced veggies as a dipping option instead of chips. Such a nice place but the food seemed a bit low budget. If they could improve the food a bit it would be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, low quality food and drinks

avoid this place."}
{"text":"I finally found a cute live music venue in Charlotte!  I recently moved here from ATl and I could find live music any day of the week there with a nice crowd.  I've been once on a Wednesday where they had great wine specials and a live band.  You can't beat 1/2 off of a glass of wine!  I've also been on Saturdays a few times.  The band always sound great and the crowd was the type I prefer to hang with.  It was crowded, but not too crowded.  The hostess eventually found my party a table, which was very accomodating.  Everyone was always nice.  The drinks were above average and I've never had anything to eat to comment on the food.  The main need for improvement is more bartenders... especially during high peak hours like weekend nights.  We always had to wait a while for our drinks or everyone's drinks came out at different times when we ordered them at the same time.  Other than that, it was a great experience.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken nachos and the chicken was from a can, as was the queso and salsa. Wine selection isn't good but 1/2 off on Wednesdays, and the music was too loud. Service was extremely slow even before it became crowded. Will only go back to try the martinis."}
{"text":"Great happy fun and energetic 
Went there tonight 6/19 to celebrate friends birthday Band was awesome our waiter was top notch and above all friendly We will be coming back"}
{"text":"I had my first experience at this bar tonight and it wasn't really good. The service was terrible, we were in a group and the server just didn't do well drinks took forever, we went to the bar while most of the party waited. Food  was just the same, we ordered after the first group received food and half of what I ordered came and about 15/20 minutes later the other came... and was cold. For all of the hype it wasn't great to me...I expected to have a great experience but I left about $50 lighter, hungry and not satisfied"}
{"text":"Is there a half star option yet? Sydney's definitely deserves it. A cousin of mine coordinated a surprise 50th wedding anniversary for her in-laws (my Aunt and Uncle) and Sydney's was selected as the venue for said party. She paid to hold a private event on a Sunday. We planned to start our surprise at 5:45 that evening so those of us who were helping to set up the party wanted to arrive at 3pm to get started which we were told would be ok. On the day of, we were told we could come at 4 instead, not nearly enough time to prepare for our guests. Luckily we were able to stick to our originally allotted time. Much to my surprise upon arrival (bringing center pieces, tablecloths, etc.) my dear cousin who planned such a beautiful evening for her in-laws was diligently sweeping the floors of Sydney's. Naturally, I jumped in to help as did my mother all while being totally confused as to why we were cleaning a bar from the previous night. As we continued, we picked up left over drinks in the window seals, moved the tables and chairs, etc. Once one of the sons of our \"suprisees\" arrived (who by the way is a CMFD Captain), he mopped the stickiest floors you'd ever hear from top to bottom. That's right, he mopped the floors of another man's place of business. We continued to clean diligently before setting up the pieces that we brought to decorate and after mopping, I noticed that my cousin was wiping the windows and front door of Sydney's. He was actually given a rag and a bottle of a cleaning liquid to wash the windows. What makes this so bad is that the owner was present the whole time that WE cleaned his establishment from the night before. One might imagine how upsetting this may be, to pay a bar/restaurant/club owner to hold a private event and then have to go through this while he sits at the bar, has a drink (very well could have just been a soda) and then leaves after troubling us about our approved catered dinner that was being brought into the bar. I believe we exceeded the expectations of paying customers. The owner, who I believe is named Gerald or \"G-Mac\" (whatever) was not even able to provide a fork or even a plate. We even had to bring our own ice to a bar. Granted, Sydney's is not a Hotel or an \"even space\" but they do serve food and manage to serve drinks from their very sparse bar. Sydney's is hardly a place where you'll find a \"Martini\". Some of our guests ordered neat drinks and could taste the cheap liquor that has been poured into \"top-shelf\" brand bottles and they were charged $13. It really pains me to express disdain for a black man and a black business owner, but Sydney's and its owner are tasteless, classless and disrespectful and will not get repeat business from us which I'm sure he doesn't care about. He didn't care to apologize for the lack of cleanliness or even offer to clean his own door (crazy thought , huh?) If you're looking for a below average night in a bar with chipped paint, torn bar stools, liquid stains on the walls and sticky floors, this is your place. After our party, we cleaned the place in the hopes of leaving it better than how we found it. If you're hoping to support a black business, try 7th District (the owner is always nice, friendly and accommodating), SportsOne, BarOne, You May even come out better at The Chicken Box."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. The band was good as well. They need to work on their food menu and the martinis are weak"}
{"text":"We went last night and had an awesome time. The drinks were absolutely amazing. My favorite martini is the pineapple upside down and the peach tree. Please support a local business. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed!! I visited Sydney's in August 2016. When I last visited the food was amazing, the atmosphere was grown and sophisticated. The menu back in August had a variety of choices to chose from, but my experience tonight was completely opposite. They no longer have live jazz on Wednesdays, which was disappointing. The menu was literally 7 items compared to over 15 from my previous visit. Also it was empty inside. I've recommended this place to many people but the reduced menu has me reluctant to visit again. I throughly enjoyed the food my first visit, but I doubt I'll be returning, which is sad because I enjoy supporting black owned businesses. The bartender also informed me that the reason for reducing the menu was because they wanted to stick to their style of venue which is a tapas bar. Hopefully this review will bring some positive changes back to Sydneys!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience tonight. Service was slow, drinks were awful. Then the server overcharged us. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time but was not impressed with the service. Added my name to the text list and by the time I made it to the desk to be seated the hostess gave away my table. Service is poor. Waiters appear to be lost and unsure of their purpose. Finally sat on the patio. The door was closed and locked for re-entry (I'm sure they didnt even realize this). I was also told their was no service from the patio. A waiter decided to take my order anyway (so I used my groupon) but even that took an hour to get. #betterlucknexttime."}
{"text":"I paid $11 for a Seagrams and grenadine \"manhattan.\" When I asked the bartender to explain why I saw her using grenadine when the menu advertised Luxardo as one of the ingredients, she took an attitude and said that they don't have Luxardo, but they're both are cherry flavored, so what's the difference(one is a pomegranate flavored syrup and the other is maraschino liqueur, but what do I know?) Kitchen was closed, so who knows how the food was.  One member of my party asked for three different wines from the menu, all of which they were out of, before finally just saying \"bring me wine.\" At one point my friend and I were  literally the only people in the bar and our glasses sat empty while the bartender, a mere ten feet away, was screwing around with her phone. Last time we'll be going. If you want a good drink, go to The Imperial. It's right around the corner, the drinks are spectacular, and they actually care about your experience. Give your business to people that actually want it."}
{"text":"Parking is available on the street and in the parking garage where Sydney's is located. As we entered the bar, we were greeted and seated immediately by the host staff. No wait. There are options for seating such as high tables, single bar area and sofas. Live jazz band was excellent. Large selection of martinis on the menu. There was also food and dessert menu. The presentation of the food was very nice. Wait staff was timely in checking back with us. Overall...great experience and ambience. I would recommend this bar to singles, couples and professionals. Dress code (from my perspective) is grown and sexy."}
{"text":"I recently attended a small 40th birthday party here and I really enjoyed the vibe of Sydney's and the live band.  It was only about 10 of us so we were able to enjoy the sofa area and the staff was great and set up a few appetizers for us while we partied.  They served shrimp cocktail, spinach dip, and chips and salsa.....everything was delicious as were the martini's."}
{"text":"Sydney's is located where Therapy Martini Bar used to be and, unfortunately, has the same dilemma after Therapy killed their great idea: expansion created way too much space in a stretched out design.  It just doesn't function well as an intimate, hip place.  Finding the bathrooms almost requires a map especially after a couple libations!

Our service was good and our waitress was very friendly.  I think she lacked training since she struggled with basic service skills.  The good news is she has a winning personality well suited for success.

On the night we went they had live music and 1/2 price wine by the glass.  Nice.  The music was excellent but our friends thought it too loud (which is part of the problem with the layout).  The downer was the basic barfood trying to act grown up.  It didn't work.  Their entire menu needs a complete rework for what they are attempting.  Our flat bread appeared to be a frozen entree from Trader Joe's and the Buffalo chicken queso reminded us of reheated jarred cheese from the grocery store with a handful of tortilla chips straight from the bag.  Quantity was small--just enough for one--and price was $10 each (during happy hour).  

We realize this location is a tough gig, and we are all hoping the new high-rise apartments on 11th will improve traffic.  In the meantime, Sydney's has to step up their game."}
{"text":"They have a good space but I don't think their using it wisely... The food is okay for a bar but my martini was very good. Adding a bit more seating would be a good idea because when I went there was not enough seating for watching a band. May go back for an event but probably not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've been here a couple of times and I've had fun each time.  I order the same thing every time I go; apple martini - good and strong and the chicken quesadillas- very delicious!  

The live music is always on point and they validate parking :-).  Great place to hang out with friends or for date night."}
{"text":"Went to Go Go Party. We were given menus. When we went to order we were informed that kitchen wasn't open and we could go out and bring food in. Well 15 minutes later the patrons to the right of us were served spinach dip. When asked we were told that someone personally made that for them and we were still unable to get food"}
{"text":"This place is the place to star or end your night in Charlotte! Great drinks, Appetizers and Entertainment.  Staff is friendly and service is good."}
{"text":"Nice establishment went at night, gets very crowded, small, live bands..drinks and food over priced..would recommend if you like to sit and relax and listen to music as there is no room for dancing and it's too loud to have good conversation"}
{"text":"Went to Sydney's last night and it was just plain awful. Waited close to an hour to get a drink at the bar. When my Appletini did arrive, it was cheap apple juice with a very small splash of vodka. Yes, apple juice. They charged over $11 for that mess. They literally had 4 servers/bartendes on a night where they were hosting a planned event which drew a very large crowd. No space to move. The table placement severely impeded any ability to move around. While people complained about the awful service, instead of assisting, the manager in the red shirt was counting a pile of cash right at the bar."}
{"text":"What a great place. My husband and I stopped for a drink and we will be back. Up beat and trendy and not only looks clean smells clean! The bartender Jay is very personable and friendly."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Bartender fixed the wrong drink and never came back with the correct drink or apologized for incorrect order.
It was 98 degrees outside and it felt like 95 degrees inside. I sweated the entire time I was there. So uncomfortable!
I will not be returning to this place, drink specials or special event won't make any difference, I will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"The bartenders are horrible! It should
Never take 30 minutes to order a drink from any bar! 

The bartenders are more focused on dancing behind the bar while socializing with their coworkers, and looking in the mirror behind the bar rather than assisting the customers. 


Would I visit this establishment again? NO"}
{"text":"Okay, I would have given more stars because of the ambiance of the venue and the Wednesday night jazz offering. However, they really need to get their communication together. When a customer points something out to you that was visible to all, it is not your place as a manager to argue with them nor make them feel less than. The manager Jeff was very condescending when I asked about reservations. If you don't like your job, then don't be there. At any rate, I like that they partnered with Jazz Diva events but if they can't keep up and be friendly to consumers, they something else needs to be done. It has also taken forever for me to get my food and drink. It's a great idea but it needs a lot of work. Especially in the customer service area."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst service I have ever experienced. 45 min to get spinach dip. The service was extremely slow with only about 25-30 people and 6 waitresses.. Go figure..."}
{"text":"This place was so wonderful. I ended up having a blast here. We were looking for a nice adult spot to go to since it was CIAA and everything was overcrowded and overpriced. When we walked in here the guy said just support the business and there wouldn't be a cover. So we ended up ordering drinks. I ordered the ginger peach martinis and it was super delicious. The bartender was very nice (handsome) and attended to everyone's needs. They had a variety of music playing and some people were up dancing. Most people I saw in here were a part of the 25 and up crew. This is the type of place that I wouldn't mind going to again when I come to Charlotte I will definitely be back to this place on my next visit. Thank you Sydney's for a great time!"}
{"text":"Went here Friday night with my wife and some mutual friends! First and foremost the live jazz singer was hands down the most talented singer I've heard in years! I will be returning for that reason alone. With that said the drinks were a little pricey and the shot I ordered was made wrong! But hey with tunes that good it was worth it!!! I'm not sure about the food but if you like music you are in for a treat! The bar itself was very clean and we'll kept as well! Wait staff was quick and polite as well. Give it a shot you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Very low key atmosphere, more like a lounge. Martini's are great, and food was pretty good. Was looking forward to the music, but it was so loud we could not stay."}
{"text":"I came here last night for happy hour and had a really good time with some friends. The staff was great even after I made a mistake and knocked a drink right out of the waitress' hand.....oops I'm horrible lol. Speaking of drinks, they were really good too. The appetizers were all good as well. Both the spinach & artichoke dip and twin chicken & cheese quesadillas were outstanding. 

As for the bar itself, it had a nice ambiance to it. They had a great selection of neo soul music playing softly in the background to where you can still have a good quiet conversation with someone without any issues (that's for all my playas out there lol). What's even better is that I was told that they have live music here on specific nights. Too add, I was also surprised at how spacious it was with plenty of seating available. I'm lazy so I hate arriving to a bar and theres no more seating available lol. 

All in all, this martini bar is just what Charlotte needs and I can definitely see myself coming back here with friends on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Okay admittedly I didn't try the food but, hey, it's a Martini bar. It was Friday night and raining like crazy so I stumbled in here for a drink and I'm so glad I did. The have a band called Affectual playing and they are just slaying it in here. If you haven't listened to them you need to do so! That aside, the crowd had a jive diverse mix and the atmosphere was very chill. Drinks were great and service from Kayla was just right! We will 100% be back and i hope this place makes it as it gives me what Therapy never did. Btw, my friend said his dirty martini was the best he'd ever had."}
{"text":"Overall the Sydney's is a nice place to go to when it's slow. However, when i went this day, they only had two bartenders and they couldn't handle the crowd. The bartenders would take your order and then 5 other people orders and then forget about yours. It happened numerous times throughout the night. They need to be better prepared"}
{"text":"New Year's Eve night, the house was packed as to be expected but the service was phenomenal. Our party of 3 sat at the bar. I could tell the alcohol ratio in all of our drinks was on point. Meaning the drinks weren't watered down. The food was actually tasty. I wish they served wings but it's ok. The chicken wrap was just as good. But the best part was the live band & the personal service. Even though our server had other customers, she made us feel like we were her only customers. I never had to ask for anything. She was always there or close by when we needed anything.  I can't remember her name. But she was awesome."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Charlotte and just wanted to finally get out of the house yesterday night and mingle a little bit. I found Sydney's after looking for a place that has a Wine Down Wednesday and for $10 wine bottles I figured \"Why not.\" To make this easy for you I have a simple pros and cons listed 

Pros:
-Great location with a parking garage right behind the building so I didn't have to drive around looking for street parking. 
-They also validate parking after 5pm and all day in     Saturday (saved me $6 ). 
-Great music for a more mature crowd (late 20's and up)
-$10 wine bottles on Wednesday 
-A quaint, intimate setting. Just the right amount of space for the crowd
-Great relaxed atmosphere with mature people, no nonsense going on at all. 
-They have tables, couches, and bar seating (options are always good

Cons:
-The bartenders take a REALLY long time just to welcome you, even sitting at the bar looking at them in their eyes. It was really slow being that I went early (7:30p) so I think she just didn't know how to multitask too well.
-For this to be a Wine and Martini bar, there was literally like 20 bottles of wine and liquor combined on the rather large wall behind the bar. It looked VERY empty and unappealing for \"bar\" because you can see right up front that the options are probably very limited for alcoholic drinks. 
-The food menu ???.... just don't eat here. It's not horrible but from my order of the \"Jumbo\" shrimp cocktail that was anything but jumbo (they were the size of the medium shrimp you buy frozen at the grocery store but I only got 6 \"jumbo\" shrimp for $11 . Yes, I was highly disappointed. The woman next to me at the bar ordered the Philly Cheesesteak egg roll and said it tasted like a gourmet hot pocket 

All in all, I will return because I like the vibe of the place but definitely on a full stomach and the expectation to wait at least 15 minutes before I even get offered a menu."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times.  Service is excellent and they have a great selection of martinis.  Appetizer menu has lite options that are good for a group just relaxing and having a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"Just ventured 8 minutes in the freezing cold to Sydney's Martini bar. This is my first experience here. 
I entered this little peaceful sanctuary playing relaxing jazz/piano music. I was greeted by a girl just as inviting as the music. She seated us at a little round table in the back of the bar. A minute later I was approached by a wonderful charming young lady named Jay. She was very knowledgeable about the martinis and guided me to exactly what I wanted (the Leona) I'm a champagne freak. It was what she promised it to be. She was so friendly and inviting that next time I'm back I will only ask for her. :) 
Great overall experience"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night since I had a groupon for lite bites there and my friend wanted to go out. We ordered their most popular martini the pineapple upside down cake. It was disgusting. If this is your best the I knew they were in trouble. Mostly all their drinks had pounds of sugar in them. Last time I checked this isn't a dessert bar?! The staff were friendly and the jazz artist was good for Saturday night.,The restrooms were over the hill and through the woods to grandmothers house we go. They were through 4 doors but they were clean when I went earlier in the evening. The food was horrible. We got the chicken nachos and spinach dip. We wanted the sliders, but we were told it's not advertised as printed on the menu where it's a fried frozen patty. I attempted to go with something fresh. The nachos were a mess. The dip was something that should cost no more than 5.00 tops if that. If you like sweet drinks and aren't a real drinker then  this is for you. I suggest they get rid of the kitchen freezer food and expend the drink menu in general to have more no sugar overloaded drinks."}
{"text":"Visiting family for the weekend....and stopped at Sydney\"s for a drink...nice atmosphere and the band was great! The only issue is that the service is terrible....it took over an hour to get a drink and apparently they ran out of ice (I guess their ice machine broke down LOLOL) because we saw folk carrying in bags of ice into the venue!"}
{"text":"Nice new lil spot located downtown. It has free parking which is great for after our drinks and being downtown. 

The night we went they had both drink and appetizer specials. I'm all about a food special. I got spinach dip and a flatbread pizza. Between the two the flatbread pizza was the best. It was regular mozzarella and marinara pizza, cooked to perfection, not overdone. I also had a cosmopolitan drink special. It was very strong and sweet. 

Our waitress was extremely friendly and very personable, checking on us multiple times to see if we needed anything. The night that we went they had karaoke. Even though it wasn't extremely crowded a few people went up there which was nice. Even the restaurant manager got on the mic to do karaoke. I thought that was a nice touch to get the patrons involved. 

The location is a little bit out of the center of uptown, so I hope this is a spot that can stick around. They aren't open for lunch so that changes things a little, but I would go again for a ladies night or after work drinks."}
{"text":"I did not have a good time here. The bartenders were all inattentive but the big male one was flamboyant and rude, drinking his own drinks in our faces while we sat there ready to order. When I simply asked if they have coconut water so I could mix it with an island drink on the menu, the bartender rolled his eyes and told me no with an attitude, like I'd asked the dumbest question requesting  a drink at a bar. So I didn't order anything at all. We were there for 20 minutes and won't be back."}
{"text":"Only giving this place 2 stars because the bartender was super friendly. Martinis are overpriced ($11) for the quality. Food is terrible. $9 Spinach Artichoke dip was out of a jar with stale tortilla chips out of a bag. $11 \"Charcuterie\" was a plate of cheap meats and cheeses. WAY overpriced for what it was. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. There are plenty of places in Charlotte that are better for the money."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like the place.   We went 2 nights in a row.  The first night the place was 1/3 full. Good music, good drinks and good service.  The second night was completely different. The place was full.  The music was still good.  After about an hour of waiting for our drink orders and food (with numerous inquiries to our server and eventually the manager) we cancelled our orders and went to Fahrenheit."}
{"text":"After reading all of the negative reviews I was a bit anxious about coming here. But, I copped a Groupon and thought here's a chance to check them out and if I don't like it I haven't lost a lot of money. So, it is my birthday weekend and hubby and I decided to stop here first before heading to The Comedy Zone for a show. We arrived around 4:30 pm and the place was empty. Seriously, we were the first guests to arrive. I guess one shouldn't be surprised since we arrived early as if we're senior citizens. Lol! We are definitely not but our show started at 7 pm and I wasn't sure if the service would be slow (as many of the reviews reported). Turns out - we beat the cook! So, we had to wait until close to 5 to order. I don't remember our server's name (sorry!) but she was friendly and attentive. OAN her hair was beautiful! (Natural girl thang). For our martinis, I had the Pineapple Upside Down and then the Sydney Peach. Both were strong and delicious. Hubs had the Ruby Red and said it was ok but not enough alcohol in it. After seeing the previous reviews about the food being average or from the microwave, we weren't expecting much but we were pleasantly surprised. We ordered 3 plates - flatbread, the salmon wrap and the chicken quesadilla. We could actually smell the food cooking and it was too strong to be from a microwave. All of the food was decent - not memorable - but decent. At the end of the day, I would return especially when they have the live music which is on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"Tiffany H and I came here one Saturday night with a Groupon for tapas. Other than the great customer service, I didn't much enjoyed my experience: Mediocre food and okay drinks.

{"text":"A very nice establishment. The service is great and the bartenders are always friendly and on point. The food is hot and tasty. If you are looking for a great bar. Look no further."}
{"text":"Nice location and they validate parking after 5pm and on Saturdays. They have an extensive martini menu and a good wine list. There are a limited number of appetizers, but I tried to the chicken spinach flat bread and the spinach dip which were really good. The night I went they had a Jazz band playing. Overall I would go back to Sydney's not sure if they offer any drink specials as our waitress didn't mention any and I didn't ask. The martini I had was 11 bucks but it was pretty big."}
{"text":"I only had a couple drinks here but they were incredible. Unbelievably, amazingly, fantastic. I don't think I've had better martinis in my life. Additionally I wish I remembered our servers name (I think it started with a \"J\") because she was sweet, funny, and adorable overall. Really, try the drinks."}
{"text":"My cousin and I found this groovy spot while visiting in Charlotte.  Our Waitress, Jayanna AKA J, couldn't have been any better.  She was warm, friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere was nice and the band was good as well.  My only complaint was that, in my opinion, the volume of the music did not need to be so loud.  It was ear piercing, making it overwhelming and taking away from the full enjoyment of it.  You literally had to yell into the ear of your party in order to for them to hear you. Totally unnecessary.  We ordered drinks and a flat bread pizza.  Everything came out great.  Thanks J.  I'll be sure to tell fam and friends to ask to be served by you.  Oh, tell them to ease up on the volume just a bit."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a drink but the servers were a little slow but once they got going it was on.  Good place for couples or singles to mingle.  The food is microwaved and awful. The pizza was a school lunch pizza and the chicken nachos were just chicken pieces over some nacho chips with melted cheese in the microwave.  It was gross. But the drinks are great."}
{"text":"Nice crowd,  horrible service. We were seated and waited twenty mins before i was forced to get up and look for the server. After i found her and told her we were waiting for her,   she still never came to the table. We decided  to order from the bar, but that's they informed us they were out of chicken.... 

We decided  to leave...doubt this place will be around long"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and as soon as I walked in, it was a $5 cover. They only take cash and they cannot put it on your Tab. Luckily, my friend had cash and paid our cover. We sat down and was never greeted by a waitress. So we got up from the table and went to the bar. There we decided to have a pomegranate martini. The bartender was nice and friendly. The drink was so pretty, I didn't want to drink but I did! LOL The place is small and they had a live band ( I am assuming that is where my cover went) But because the place is small, it is hard to talk to anyone in there cause the music is loud. so don't expect to have an ongoing conversation with yelling at your friend. I am indifferent about this place. If someone asks me to to with them, I will but it won't be place I will go back to on my own."}
{"text":"Over valued themselves I have issues with a restaurant who charges a cover. The menu is limited at best."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, the live music and the staff who remember my name (it's Cheers!) even though there are sometimes months between my visits. The martini selection is delicious and well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this spot and I would have to say I really enjoyed myself! It was \"wine down wednesdays\" with $10 wine bottles for sale! They had a great DJ who was playing all the old hip hop and r&b music. I was out celebrating a birthday and we all enjoyed ourselves! Just a good time. I believe they also sold food and had other drink specials. I would recommend! Not sure if they have other themed nights"}
{"text":"Sydney's is a nice spacious lounge located uptown. The staff is friendly and they will validate your parking if you park in the garage behind the building. Validation of parking is awesome uptown because it's can be hard to find parking without paying.

I went for Wine Down Wednesday where select bottle of wine are $10. Yes, I said $10 for a bottle of wine. The DJ was good and people stayed on the dance floor. This particular night was really busy and I had great time."}
{"text":"Wine special was great. Really need a better food menu with more options. Ive been several times but won't eat the food.  Not worth the money. Nice venue with great music. Has a lounge/bar feel."}
{"text":"This place the potential to be an awesome spot for lovers of live jazz. But they definitely have to work on serving drinks in a timely fashion. I kid you not, it took 20 minutes to get our drinks. Additionally, it took 10 minutes to get our check and credit card. Again, the music is great but the service is terrible. I did not try any of the food."}
{"text":"Friday late night (7/22/2016) was my 1st time out to Sydney's. This was such a fun wine/martini bar! I went with a group of friends to hear a mutual friend sing, and her performance was the highlight of the evening. Their martini list is extensive, however, when I switched over to beer, it took 3 orders for me to get a beer selection (no Stella, and no Mich Ultra even though it was on the menu). Before my husband switched over the beer, he had 1 vodka/sprite, and 2 kamikaze shots, which totaled $30.00! Ouch! Wasn't expecting that! Our waitress Jackie was outstanding; attentive and prompt and very friendly. The place is intimate enough to have conversations, but big enough to move around. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Just came inside and decided to change my review after only 10 minutes inside. This place charged me and my crew a cover to enter, however did not charge several people (20+ to be exact) that came in after us. We know this because our table was relatively close to the entrance. We spoke to the waitress about this and she informed us that their hostess called out and the manager was handling the door. She apologized and stated she was going to get the manager and have her come over. SHE NEVER CAME, but did look over at our table several times. What kind of customer service is this? Especially for someone who frequents this bar... and tonight I brought newbies with me. I was happy to introduce them to this place. What a waste... hate to say it, but Sydney's.. what a disappointment."}
{"text":"Great assortment of martinis and the staff is very professional.. Love seeing Gena Chambers and The Kevin Jones Experience perform.. always a great time!"}
{"text":"Sydney's on a Friday night is a nice option for those who enjoy live jazz. There's enough space here for every seat to be filled and there be room to breathe. This was the case last night, as my date and I were able to find a seat at the bar quickly. It didn't take too long to get drinks while we waited on a table. 

Unfortunately, after we were seated, no waitress ever came. We were sitting with another couple and the guys ended up returning to the bar to get another round. This place is cool, but service HAS to improve.

- I had a peach martini, which was tasty. 
- The live music was nice, but not too loud.
- The air was out. Do better.
-The restrooms are a little out of the way and I would only go with a friend, as it's down a hall with several mystery doors."}
{"text":"Another wonderful night! The music is always great, the drinks, amazing, the food, awesome and the hostess is the best! She may not know your name but she remembers a face and that's what it's all about!!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of one is because of the live music, everything else was subpar. Their menu was somewhat limited so I ordered a chicken and cheese quesadilla, thinking I can't really go wrong with that choice...I was wrong! They must have just baked it in an oven or toaster oven because the tortilla was extremely crispy (not in a good way, it crumbled as I picked it up) and the cheese wasn't even fully melted in the inside. The chicken tasted like some inexpensive pre-made and prepackaged stuff you get from a discount grocery store. My friends ordered \"chicken nachos\" in parentheses because these were unlike any nachos I've ever seen, other than inside an elementary school cafeteria. They used those cheap chips and poured some cheese concoction on them, gross! It was the flattest, saddest looking plate of nachos I've ever seen. I found that everyone at my table was more tolerating their food than enjoying the food. I found the drinks to be about a dollar or two more than what I'm used to paying for the same drink elsewhere. While my waitress was very nice, they were grossly understaffed as it took 30 minutes plus for simple things like a drink order or a refill of water. However, given that she was the only person working in the rather large area, I'm blaming that on management not her. Lastly, I thought it was a bit much to charge cover at 8 o clock when people are still coming in for food. I've definitely paid a cover at places but usually not this early in the evening especially when having food. I will likely not return unless I hear that some changes have been made in the kitchen department because I honestly could have gotten better food at Taco Bell and paid considerably less."}
{"text":"The band is good..  drinks are awesome... Service is not so good... The waitress took our food order it's been almost two hours and she comes back and states that she didn't even put the order in... Geesh. Normally its not this bad..  but tonight it's horrible.. if you come make sure you eat first..."}
{"text":"Pretty average bar in downtown Charlotte. Awesome martini menu and all look very good. I had their classic Sydney dirty martini and shrimp cocktail followed by a glass of wine. I came on a Monday night which was advertised on their restaurant as happy hour $7 martinis. When I arrived, however, this was not the case. They only served $12 martinis despite what was advertised on their website. That being said the drinks and food I had were good (I'd definitely recommend if you haven't been) but not enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Interesting place we got there late and it was empty.The service from the staff was great, and it had a nice atmosphere. The space is huge but lacks the appropriate decor not enough furniture and needs help with designing."}
{"text":"This was the worst bar experience ever, I started with a dirty martini.  The drink was all vodka because they had very little olive juice (per the bartender) no big deal...things happen. I took the drink paid for it and that was the end of it.  Why oh why did I attempt to order another drink? Everything went all the way downhill when I decided to order drink #2.  My friend made me aware of the drink specials so I decided to try \"Midnight Run\".  The young man with the ponytail that took my order was very confused and stood at the register display looking lost for about 3 minutes. He then sought help from 2 of his colleagues.  Next thing I know  he's  taking orders from other patrons (insert confused face here).  I sat and observed him making drinks for other customers...still I had no drink.  About 10-12 minutes later the female bartender comes over asking if I'd ordered the \"Island-something\", I responded no and watched as she went down the bar asking other patrons if they'd ordered it...all replied \"no\".  Things got interesting when I observed her speaking with the original fella and he pointed in my direction as if the drink belonged to me(insert second confused face here). Bartender #1 (confused ponytailed fella) came back over to ask if I'd ordered the \"Midnight Run\" (with the incorrect drink in hand).  I replied \"Yes, that's correct.\"  He then walked away.  In my mind I just knew he's about to start making the correct drink...not so.  Moments later no drink and I watched as the bartender number 1 and 2 took everyone else's order.  As opposed to causing a scene and waiting for the confusion to clear I decided I'd wasted enough of my time and simply walked away from the bar. At this point Sydney's did not deserve my money.  

Not once did the bartenders attempt to remedy the situation or even acknowledge the issue at hand.  Had it not been for a close friend performing that night I would have walked out.  I don't wish any negativity on this place of business but people do not wish to spend their hard earned money in an establishment with poor/rude service.  

Unrelated side note:  If it's 100 degrees outside it is not a wise decision to set your thermostat at 97 degrees...SMH"}
{"text":"I really, really want this bar to be successful. The interior is sexy and sophisticated with plenty of seating. The house band or soul singers are fantastic, some of the best I have heard in town. But the martinis and wine selection are not very good at all. \"Martini\" and \"Wine\" is in the title, right?"}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte and was looking for a mature place to have a cocktail and jazz music Sydney's delivered the band was nice the choice e of tini's was on point the crowd was easy and the service was nice!! The menu is limited but the food was good to add to your tini!! Enjoy"}
