{"text":"Mile Enders know this place as Cafe Social, so I hope this is being posted in the right place. Anyways, this is the doppelganger to Olympico. The coffee is excellent, although I have to admit it's just a knick under Olympico. It's a very warm inviting atmosphere although it's always best to get a latte to go and walk around the hood. I don't know if they serve food, and I couldn't care less. No reason to go there other than for the coffee."}
{"text":"\"...  I didn't feel well, but they told me I was well enough. They didn't say in so many words that I was as well as I would ever be, but that was the implication.\"  a wondrous place for complete nobodies and somebodies alike, young and 'any moment now' people, haves and have nots, social loafers and loaners. there are  lots of places where you feel ostracized because they cater to certain clientele, but here you are  just a solid among other solids. to borrow from neil young, old man, take a look at my life, i'm a lot like you.    oh ya, great coffee/family run staff."}
{"text":"I love this place. The friendliest Italian guy named Jay runs the coffee shop/bar. Great coffee and wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in mtl. No bs. Just good coffee and nice people. I hate coffee art but their coffee is art."}
{"text":"Come here for excellent Italian style coffee drinks in the Mile-End. Some of the best coffee in the city no doubt. Get an iced drink freshly made to cool off from the impending summer."}
{"text":"Location: In the Mile End, a few doors down from Olimpico. The closest subway stop is probably Laurier and it's a 10-15 minute walk from there. Street parking is available [metered].  Watch out for the residential zones.  The place: Small. Brown. Good light. Personally, I found it to be a little cramped and overall, the vibe just didn't work for me.   The coffee: They make a good Macchiato and my friend enjoyed her latt√©. No complaints about the coffee.   Service: I don't know if I went on an off day or what - but contrary to its name \"Club Social\", this place isn't 'social' at all. The baristas weren't friendly and I don't even think they greeted us when we placed our order. No smiles, no warmth - nada. A little disappointing given all the positive reviews, but that's the way it is. I gave them 3 stars because the coffee was good.  Price point: On par with other coffee shops in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing latte & cappuccino, friendly barista, funky and fun. Outdoor patio. Love this place! (Reasonable prices are a bonus.) Next time I'm in Montreal, I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for takeout on a Friday morning and the place was bumping with locals working away on their laptops or chatting up their friends. The cafe reminds me more of a pub than an cafe, but the coffee is great. The americano I had from here was definitely one of the best that I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Located in a \"cool\" area in Montreal. They have a great choice of Italian coffees to choose from. Great sandwiches. Friendly and sociable staff, that's probably where the name comes from. Very reasonable prices and overall a great place to hang out with family and friends."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are amazing. Meat sliced fresh when you order it, pressed with hot peppers and pickled eggplant, thin light lovely bread dripping with hot olive oil, a kind of heaven, especially in the leafy sun on the pretty terrasse with it's wooden balustrades, locals leaning in from their bikes all around, writers peering up at you, old folks inside around the bigger round tables, reading the paper or talking slow. A great place for a bangin 2$ latte, or a beer or glass of wine. A beautiful spot to read a book, people watch, have quiet talks, and be inspired."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a quick cappuccino instead of the regular Olimpico down the block. Groovy little local place to come for coffee, sandwiches or a drink if you have paid the $25 annual membership fee. I found the annual membership for consuming alcohol quite interesting. Not sure if this has to do with their liquor licence, or if they want to discourage tourists or if this is some secret stonecutters society (like Homer was a member on one episode of the Simpsons).   When I was waiting for my cappuccino two people were ordering sandwiches which made me believe they do a fine sandwich here.  Must come back to check this out.   My cap was creamy, tasty and of fine strength. Sure most go down the block to Olimpico but I was decently impressed. I am very intrigued about the sandwiches here. For $5.50 I'll be back as they seem well priced and are probably devilishly tasty"}
{"text":"Ha, this place is great. Came here for coffee two mornings in a row.  Three old crusty guys work it.  Great espresso. The biscotti (which, let's be real are just candy bars) were a dream.  You want a biscotti, help yourself. Ice? Help yourself.   \"Who's taking the cup?\"  ::blank stare::  \"You guys from Brooklyn?\"  \"How'd you know!?\"  **eyes as if to say \"You had no idea I was asking about hockey\" **  I appreciate this place and everything about it."}
{"text":"This place is quintessential mile-end, 'Nuff said!  Along with its neighbouring cafe, the patio/terrasse/outdoor seating are ritualistic for the neighbours and visitors to the St Viateur strip. Regardless how winter treated Montreal, that first warm day during the spring transition and bam! their outdoor is packed and bustling with energy and conversation.  Note they do serve alcohol but you do have to be member of the \"Club\", which i believe is $25 or 35 annually. Why dont you go inquire inside the cafe to confirm?"}
{"text":"The best espresso drink I had during my visit to Montreal! My friend and I came here every morning. I appreciated the almond milk option and the friendly staff"}
{"text":"Place kind of sucks, or at least by the owner's attitude. He clearly did not want us there and did not want to serve us, and overcharged us while exchanging much friendlier pleasantries with locals. I suspect he might also have swapped out my white rose tea with generic black tea, hoping I wouldn't notice."}
{"text":"I was always curious  of trying unique coffee with special names. I tried mini me here, which is small latte I guess. 2.25 dollar"}
{"text":"Seriously great hole in the wall cafe! Stopped here after grabbing a bagel and the place exudes local charm! The owner sang to us in Italian and was super friendly. We just got here, but I think we may park it here all afternoon! Great place to sit and read a book, people watch, or just enjoy an amazing cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"A favourite hangout of mine when visiting Montreal. Intimate and friendly environment and a great pace to hang outdoors on the bench under the tree sipping coffee. I much prefer this place over Olympico."}
