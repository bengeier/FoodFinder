{"text":"I was scared reading all these bad reviews as I wait for my 2 s slices of cheese pizza for only a few bucks. The  pizza is decent for the money. What do you expect?. I'll be back to try out there diverse menu as I continue getting the pizza for the kids. What place can you order hot wings, Philly, Gyros, Calamari and Tiramisu?"}
{"text":"I was over charged, for a mistake that was made by them, while getting an attitude, for mediocre food....  I've worked in a little pizza place similar to this one... (Food was a little bit tastier, but that's not the reason for the one star rating.) I mentioned working at a pizza place because I know how people can be and how much it sucks to make a mistake. But Im also aware as to how easy it is to just smile and be nice to people regardless if a mistake was made or if they were rude or kind.... Well, there is this older guy that works the register, and he has the worst attitude- any other time I've put my order in it's been two large pizzas one cheese one pepperoni, two 2liters and two ranches for roughly $12/$13... And regardless if the order is right and the transaction goes smooth- this guy still has the worst attitude. Well tonight I walk up to the shop to get my order and it's $1 cheaper than usual, and I also get only one pizza handed to me.... So I told him that my roommate had ordered two pizzas... He tells me no he only ordered the one. I then apologize to him and suggest that maybe it was a misunderstanding and to give me a moment to make sure- I called my roommate, he assures me two pizzas were ordered, as per usual. I tell the man yes sir two pizzas were ordered; one cheese and one pepperoni- he then tells me again, no just one pizza was ordered and that the guy ordered, \"a pizza with cheese and pepperoni\"..... Now usually most pizzas come with cheese as a given, or if I wasn't sure I would have kindly asked the customer to repeat what they had said - (where I worked we read back the order at the end of the call anyway, just to make sure it was what they ordered)... He maintains that one pizza was ordered... I asked him if I could please just have the other pizza..... So while telling me that most people that order from them \"they ask for a pizza with cheese and pepperoni\" he then tells me it's going to be a 7 minute wait, which I'm fine with because fresh food is the best, but then he charges me -on top of the original $11.50- another $5.50 for the \"extra pizza\"...... I ended up apologizing for the misunderstanding- he made no apologies or attempt to make it better...  Now I'm not sure if there is a mistake fee the customer has to pay or we just got charged extra for the extra awesome attitude- but this sucks and I wish I would have caught it before I walked home and my roommate pointed it out to me. I know the difference is only a couple bucks, but it makes a difference when you're trying to watch your money... The attitude was just the icing on the cake I guess... $17 for mediocre food and extra wait time.... I don't understand?"}
{"text":"I usually just get the meatball sub and a Greek salad have had pretty good luck with that tried the pizza it was dry and overcooked I believe if I stick to the meatball sub in the Greek salad I'll be in good shape I read a lot of reviews on this place and they were mostly negative buyer beware"}
{"text":"I called early on a Saturday night and was asked if I could hold.  I was put on hold for nine minutes and then hung up on.  I called back and he said, \"Sorry, I dropped the call.  Hurry.  I'm really busy\". I wish I could tell you how good their pizza is but I told him if he was really busy then we would try someplace else."}
{"text":"I will provide a caveat in that I live in the neighborhood, and Manhattan's is a 5-10 minute walk when I want a pizza. The management has always shown me terrific customer service, even when I phone in a take-out order at 10 minutes before closing, because they know I'll come running to pick up my pies. The pizza is not the the most flavorful. But it's not greasy and really not bad. But it's 4-star convenient! When I want a $5 Large takeout pizza late Saturday night and I \"shouldn't\" drive, I know I can call in and grab one of these. And it will always be hot, fresh, and satisfying when I want cheap pizza to balance out weekend beverages ;)

I've tried their burger/fries combo and their gyro combo as well. The veggies were fresh, and everything was okay. But it's the cheap, hot, and fast pizza that earns this place my loyalty."}
{"text":"I ordered a Gyro salad with Feta Cheese for lunch one day.  The flyer that was delivered to my job a few days ago listed the Gyro Salad as $5.99.  When I went to Manhattan Pizza's Whitney Ranch location the cashier charged me $8.00 for my meal.  I asked him why it was so much and he said he charged me 8.1% tax and $1.00 for the Feta Cheese.  The menu in the restaurant listed the price of the Gyro Salad as $6.49.    I forgot the salad was supposed to only be $5.99 and I guess $1.00 extra for the cheese.  I called the restaurant when I got back to work and the cashier was yelling at me to do the math.  I just hung up on him.  They have the same menus with all different prices on them and I should've brought the menu that was delivered to me when I went to pick my order up.   I didn't think I would have to do that.  I will NEVER order from Manhattan Pizza again.  They are cheap and petty and the food isn't even good.  I didn't place my own order, my boss did, thinking the prices on the menu were accurate.  I will NEVER patronize this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Closest place to my home, basic burgers, ok pizza, salads...blah. The only thing I frequently order are the gyros. The meat has a lot of flavor but they don't give you much, and if you pay for extra meat, they usually forget it. It's a shame cuz I would order their gyros more often."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are off the chain! The ranch is tremendous! I'm kinda mad that I just found this place and I've been working in the area for a year. Customer service was good too. This place will definitely be one of my go-to's for lunch."}
{"text":"I liked the chicken empanadas more than the beef. The Philly pizza is ight. This place is pricey if your ordering delivery. I got a small pizza $10. 99 2 empanadas $5 and 2 cans of soda $2 and it came out to like 30 bucks like wth. Will be my last time ordering from this place."}
{"text":"I really like the pizza but the cashiers always round up on the taxes to the nearest quarter... that is illegal. But the $5 pizza is always good when you call ahead."}
{"text":"Food was scheduled for a delivery and arrived a half hour late. Despite what the owner said who stands by the quality of their food (why wouldn't they?) - the food arrived cold and was disgusting from top to bottom. We would certainly never order from them again unless we were in the mood for slightly cooked pizza and calzone."}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite on our way to the park. Got a mushroom and spinach pizza and chicken tenders covered in hot sauce.

The hot sauce was good, but the pizza was just ok..."}
{"text":"BEWARE I  called in a jumbo pizza for pickup, when I got there to pick up I added 2-sm bottles of soda, the older mexican man who took the order made the pizza & rang me up, never keyed in the order into cash register, he just punched in $39.00 I said wow really? How much was the pizza? He said 36.00 are you fn kidding me! No fn pizza is worth 36.00 dollars! & 2 sodas 39.00 unreal & it wasn't even that good, very greesy. They are dirty & rude! My 1st time there & my last!! Again beware, seems to me as thou they charge what ever the hell they want to charge, & if your not keying in the items correctly in the cash register, tells me your scamming your customers & taxes, business, ect. Something, some how it appears! Thumbs"}
{"text":"Garbage! Pizza is sub par. Not to mention they'll cheat you any chance they get. You better ask for the price on the menus they hang on your door every week or they'll tack an extra $5 on there if you're not paying attention."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. The other workers are actually quite nice, but one of their cashiers is extremely rude and very disrespectful. I have been here multiple times and he never fails at having poor customer service. The food is actually quite good, it's a shame this cashier had to ruin that for me."}
{"text":"After reading a lot of bad reviews I figured I would roll the dice for fun and try the $5 dollar special. It came to $5.95 after tax which is almost 20% tax but whatever I'm not on a budget so i paid it.  I gave the four stars because I graded on a curve. If a Little Cesar's Pizza was next door I would probably choose Manhattan Pizza for two reasons. One it is a small mom and pop type shop. Two the pizza is bigger and does provide more flavor.  In the price range of $5 for a pizza it would be tough to find a better pie. Don't get me wrong it is not the best pizza in Vegas but it is the best $5 I have had."}
{"text":"Every time I order from here everything is burnt and when you call to complain they tell you that sucks. I ordered a pizza and soda one day never got the soda and the pizza looked like charcoal"}
{"text":"I called at 8:30 to place a delivery order. After nearly 2 minutes, someone finally answered the phone. As I began to place an order, he cut me off and told me that they were closing in 25 minutes. This would have been my first time ordering from this store, but now they will never have my business. 
They even tried to win my business by putting a door hanger on my front door. It is stupid that they ask for my business and then deny me when I call.
I gather Manhattan pizza 2 and the first one didn't make it due to unprofessional practice. Anyway, this my post due to their failure to provide service."}
{"text":"Never coming here again, first I place an order online then I get a call that it's going to be $2 extra because the item I chose as my first topping/free topping doesn't qualify as a free topping, then they deliver it then forget my soda and they guy said hold on I got to get my phone from the car and call my manager. He comes back up and says I can give you a discount of $2, I said OK what about my soda? He said oh you don't get that. Um OK so thats not a discount, thats just like I didn't order a soda, I ordered soda for a reason, then he got mad and getting loud! I didn't end up even take the order, it probably would've been wrong anyways!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant at least once a week for the past three years.  I love their pizza.  Their sandwiches and burgers rock too!  They have great customer service and they treat my family like we are part of theirs.  I cannot say enough good stuff about this restaurant.  Go and eat there you will love it as much as we do."}
{"text":"I would say you get what you pay for about the pizza (5$)  guy said 20 mins we got there in 15 to pick up and the pizza was cold. I guess they compensate the price of the pizza with the other items on the menu just paid 16$ fr 8 piece chicken fingers w/o fries which  were cold also. The 10mile drive was not worth 22.20.  Staff is very rude as well."}
{"text":"I have been going to this establishment for about 8 months with no issues and today when i drove home and opened my pizza i found a bug crawling on my pizza. I called to let them know and was hung up on and the person working was completely rude and disrespectful. Now i have no pizza and i am out the money. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"The pizza here is okay, but is expensive and customer service sucks.  I ordered a large 1/2 Pineapple & Ham, and 1/2 Sausage & Pepperoni.  When I picked it up, it was $29.99!  I was told that even though on the list of regular toppings ham and pineapple are included, when ordered together on a pizza it becomes a\"speciality\" then they charged me $2.50 for each \"additional\" (sausage and pepperoni on the other half).  I say that it isn't \"additional\" as I wasn't getting a a whole ham & pineapple and adding the sausage and pepperoni, I was getting 1/2 and 1/2.  Even though I HAD been a regular (3-4 times a month) customer, I was told \"Tough, that's how it is\".  Almost needless to say, I left the pizza and walked out.  I haven't been back and don't miss it."}
{"text":"The sauce here is what makes the pizza pretty good; the service is whatever and their gyros are so-so.  Their \"pick-up special\" is great so if you don't want to spend a lot of money, give that a try."}
{"text":"I've ordered many times through the eat24 app to have delivered to my office because we're just up the street. The last time I ordered, they told me that their lunch specials had changed a year ago and they no longer included a soda when I had ordered a couple months before and received the soda. The manager was very rude on the phone yet I still said we'd keep the order and expected the delivery within the hour like it was stated. Shortly after, I received an email from eat24 that our order had been canceled. I will no longer be ordering from here."}
{"text":"Very good pizza for a decent price. Definitely will be returning. I was tipped to go to this place by someone who is from nyc. They said it's the closest place they have found that compares to home."}
{"text":"The food is ok. I expect more to be tasty the lasagna and the bread. The chicken wings needs to be bake not fried. I will try to avoid unhealthy food from now on."}
{"text":"It was juts ok but I'm picky with my pizza. The sauce had a weird after taste. The cheese was weird. The staff was kind of rude. Eh. Pizza Hut is better."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery since I just moved to Henderson from Spring Valley and was trying to establish a new pizza place. I read the reviews but thought it can't be that bad. Ordered a cheese pizza with sausage my kids thought was good. I would have tried it but I was so disappointed with the salty philly cheese with the hard to chew bread. The wings were overcooked. The fries were ok. I should have stuck with Dominos."}
{"text":"They leave coupons on my door all the time. I called to order one day and they said the delivery costs extra because I live far away. I'm only 6 streets down!"}
{"text":"Don't order from this place. The food is awful! I ordered from Grubhub. I have never had chicken parm with the chicken cut into little strips before being baked with the cheese on top. The result is rock hard chicken pieces...disgusting! When I called to complain I was told very rudely \"That's the way we make it sorry if you don't like it\" and then hung up on me. I will never order from them again and probably not order from Grubhub either since they had 4.5 rating for them."}
{"text":"First of all... I NEVER get anything delivered.  IMO, delivery is just as bad as drive-thru service: They're bound to get something wrong.  With that said, I think this place is going to be in my regular rotation.  I found them using my Eat 24 app.  I ordered using the app also, so I don't know how ordering over the phone is.  I used the coupon for a medium three-topping pizza and a 2 liter pop.  

The pizza was pretty good.  It was a medium, but I would have called it a large size.  We had peperoni, meatball, and mushroom.  The inner crust was thin while the outer portion of the crust was a little thicker and had some substance to it.  The sauce, cheese, and toppings were all good.  My only complaint is the mushrooms were canned.  They were fine, but I prefer fresh.

This is a small neighborhood joint.  The owners seem nice and friendly.  If you live in the area, you should check it out."}
{"text":"The food is average at best but the people that answer the phone & check you out are absolutely the most rudest people.  This guy will yell at you and is down right mean.  I love maw & paw places but this guy must have enough money already that he does not need any more business.  And I saw a young 10 year old kid that desperately needed the bathroom and this guy flew off his rocker screaming at this poor kid and refusing the bathroom to her because she did not buy anything.  Really...your bathroom is that great you have to scream at a 10 year old and refuse her?  When your business fails - don't ask why!"}
{"text":"Food was fair...  Service was poor.  Driver forgot 1/3 of our order and blamed it on the restaurant.  70 minutes later the driver shows again with the wrong stuff.  Call the restaurant, they only make excuses and blame the driver.  STILL no satisfaction."}
{"text":"If you are living in the area or visiting for a day, Manhattan Pizza III has some pretty fantastic coupons online. Now note the fact that I said \"coupon\" because normally that word makes me cringe. 

I am frugal (sometimes) yes, but I have never been a coupon queen. However, it was brought to my attention that you can get 2 XL 1-topping pizzas AND a 2-liter bottle of soda for..*drum roll please*.. $19.99!! I don't know about you but that's a pretty fantastic deal!

Now, lets talk about the food. Their interpretation of NYC, or \"Manhattan\" pizza is pretty comparable to other pizza joints that TRY their best to replicate the all and mighty East Coast Pizza. It's a fair try, they certainly make it large enough, the cheese is similar, my only gripe is the pizza crust is a little on the thick side (for NY style pizza) and the sauce is just a tad too sweet.

Would I order it again, ABSOLUTELY! The price is right and it's not any more special than Villa Pizza and it's half the cost.

Hope this review helps, enjoy!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good and it always smells good when we come inside. Prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"ordered white cheese pizza and some wings. Pizza  was delicious, portion control was good, not to greasy. Wings were cooked correctly, I asked for them to be crispy and I got them crispy. All in all the food was great and I will be back. I hear the service is poor, I did not see that. The two men were busy and taking care of business."}
{"text":"So here's another update to my previous one star review I'm still giving them one star because they had some guys driving through my work parking lot today selling pizzas and the pizza still sucks! I did not know it was from Manhattan Pizza until one of my other employees told me where it came from and gave me the flyer the gentleman left with him! Pizza tastes like cardboard"}
{"text":"Its been a while since I visited Manhattan Pizza. I used to frequent this place for their pizzas and wings. Ordered buffalo wings this time and they were finger licking good. Greasy, crunchy and tasty. Not battered, not under-cooked and not undersized either. Some might argue that the owner is a little rough around the edges, but I disagree. Language might be the issue here. He went out of his way to understand my order over the phone and even included extra sauce for my wings without me asking."}
{"text":"I wish I could say more about this place, but it was very bad, it would get no stars if I could do that but when someone doesn't serve fountain sodas in the restaurant, you know you're going to get a frozen patty for your hamburger and a frozen pizza, no homemade anything here. Horrible, will not ever come back here again. Unless there's a zombie apocalypse and that's the only place that has food left"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, not great. The reason for one one star is as follows...

I called and asked if they still had the five dollar large pizza. They replied yes that they did. So I ordered one pepperoni and then another half pepperoni and half Hawaiian. The total came to $16. I told them I thought the pizzas were five dollars? They said it was extra for the Hawaiian. I said they didn't tell me that on the phone. I specifically asked about the five dollar pizza. They should've mentioned that. So they charged me 6  dollars for a half Hawaiian which was clearly a rip off. And the large pizza is more like a medium. Will stick with Little Caesars."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bomb for 5.50 a pizza.  Owner is not naturally friendly probably gets tired of people coming in to just sit at his restaurant without ordering but if you're nice to him he's nice back! Also the pizza and ranch is sooo delicious."}
{"text":"Not great, not awful. Just had pepperoni and tomato pizza. It did the trick. Pretty diverse (non-Italian) menu so can't say their other items are any good. Saw one guy taking money then chopping salad. Didn't see a hand wash. Probably not going there again."}
{"text":"I'm fairly sure the positive reviews for this place are all fake. I don't have much of a problem with bad pizza places. They leave me alone, I leave them alone. But, for God's sake, don't call yourself Manhattan Pizza if what you're offering is the furthest thing from the New York slice imaginable. 

Vegas is not a bad NY pizza town. Rocco's (the two in Summerlin, not the independently owned one on Buffalo) and Verrazano's (the one on Rainbow & the 95, not the unrelated one on Rainbow & Flamingo) are both superb slices you could expect to find at any corner pizza shop in The City. I give both of them 8.5 out of 10. Even Metro Pizza is OK.

But Manhattan Pizza III is the culinary equivalent of Jaws III. It is by far the worst mom & pop pizza place I've ever tried IN MY ENTIRE LIFE and, at 52 years old, I've tried thousands. THOUSANDS.

The slice had a crunchy cardboard crust, sauce like a Ragu jar and lily-white cheese on top that didn't intermingle with it at all. (Good New York pizza is orange because the sauce and cheese bubble together.) 

This place should be called Manhattan FEETZA, because that more accurately describes the taste than its current name."}
{"text":"BE WARNED!  This has to be frozen pizza they serve.  I've never had more disgusting pizza EVER!!  Had 2 pieces of cheese pizza  and it was Horrible.   Never ever to return.  I told another guy I worked with on that job not to go there coz he said he was planning on it.  I should have returned it but I had already paid.   Pathetic place."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service ever! The guy who answers the phone is very rude everytime.the pizza is always cold and wings taste stale. Worse pizza spot EVER!"}
{"text":"So after seeing this place ONLY have been rated 2 stars I decided it's time to give my review. I have been coming here for about 3 years now and absolutely love it. I would say that customer service is a bit harsh LOL only because it's hard to get a smile out of the staff (but they aren't rude) and food wise it's always amazing! My food is always perfect as I ask for it, fresh, tasty, and overall FAST. I'm not sure why it's rated so low as this is one of our #1 pizza spots I have no complaints :)"}
{"text":"What has happened to this location.?!  Worst pizza and chicken wings ever. Weird tasting wings, hardly any sauce, cheese or pepperoni on the pizza and it tasted stale. The fries were soaked with oil and under cooked. Just nasty food. We threw it all in the trash. Waste of money. 
      DO NOT EAT FROM THIS LOCATION.!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. First time I ordered I complained of piece of meat (1 piece) that had mold. Didn't make a huge deal out of it but definitely pointed it out. Never heard back from them. Today my family and I tried ordering $65 dollars worth of food for our dinner. After an hour of waiting I contact the yelp app to see what's going on. 10 minutes later I get a call back from the app (god forbid the restaurant call and apologize for themselves) that for some \"unknown\" reason they can't deliver my order and it's being cancelled. This place is bullshit and if you're a local looking for a good eat go to Albos off Las Vegas boulevard and Oakey. Best food ever!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, it was delish. And I also had some Baklavá is was actually very good. Super close to me, which I love. Definitely will be back in for some more."}
{"text":"I've ordered pizza here for years. It's good, friendly service, quick delivery, and it's down the street. It's not greesy like Napoli's and the crust is amaZING!

I love this place and will order from here always. They have tons of other items on the menu but I've always just gotten the pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza tasted/felt/looked like it was a frozen pizza. The crust was hardish and like eating a hard cookie, thats the best I could compare it to. Like those cheap frozen pizzas. 

Also I was kind of thinking this would be NY pizza since it's called manhattan pizza, but it was nothing like NY pizza. 

Overpriced food and over priced delivery charge. $6 for 8 miles away. But hey, I knew that to begin with."}
{"text":"I ordered  food from here and they took longer than a hour 20min after calling and calling with no answer...! Then got told the wrong total and tried calling to talk about the miss hap and again no answer so had the delivery guy call and they answered the guy started yelling at me and telling me to never go there or order again very very rude... Also the food was cold and I only live a 1.5 miles away...!!!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from Manhattan Pizza for over a year now. The staff is always super friendly and yesterday I had the pleasure of speaking with the owner's wife... she was such a sweetheart. The pizza is fabulous...great dough and they are always generous with the toppings. 

They need to bottle their ranch. It's sooooo gooooood."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm not a person that usually yelps. I mean just look at my profile and you'll see. But I do feel inclined to share my dining experience this time. 

*sigh* where do I start ? Oh yes, from the bathroom , were I've been vomiting for the last 10-15 minutes. That's the wings fault. Listen I knew these non chain pizzerias definitely pull their frozen wings out of a bag, but jeezus christ. Were they from last year?? I mean you couldn't bite through the SKIN! Way to oily , greasy, I literally feel sick again just talking about them. No human being should be subject to what I have just eaten, Christ help your esophagus. 

Now; the pizza. Your a pizzeria. Dude you had one job.ONE job !! How can you serve people that thing, and accept money for it?! Don't you feel bad? Showed up cold,undercooked, and the fkn cheese was it's own plastic layer completely seperate from the bread! Will post picture to explain. You can't serve this kind of product !!!!! It literally was the worst thing I HAVE EVER! Eaten. I'm ashamed and embarrassed , I only hope these people read these reviews and up they're quality because we don't need another place serving garbage in this neighborhood. Fuck."}
{"text":"Very good lil mom and pop pizza shop. Can't beat the combo prices ! Give it a try if you around neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great service. Looks like a family business done by Greeks (they also have gyros). They were really friendly and cool people. I had a Philly cheesesteak and the meat and cheese were perfect. Extra hot sauce to top it off. The bread was a bit dry, but with a side of fries for $6.95 you can't go wrong. My friend got a basic cheeseburger and it was huge and tasty for $5.95. Definitely worth a quick bite if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Heard great things about their pizza. Went in to try. Kids and I say at one of their 4 tables. After waiting forever the man yells over the wall have I ordered yet. I said no. Then after waiting even longer we got up to leave. Then he yells sorry if I don't like it they have no table service. I told him there were no signs and no one offered to tell us. He then yells he's got a camera it's ok. I don't recommend this place. The man was very loud and rude. No one there was kind or helpful. Too bad"}
{"text":"If you order delivery  from here DO NOT do it online (Eat 24)...CALL them! I recently looked at my past orders & noticed that I've been overcharged by $4-$5 bout 5 out 7 times. Our pizza is ALWAYS so greasy and cold...they never remember ranch for the chicken fingers... onion rings are soggy and have never been more than 5. I once waited an hour 20 for cold food! Then an additional 40 minutes for our 2 liter and ranch. Last time, I ordered Sprite and they gave us Squirt. This used to be our pizza place but we're just tired of calling after the past 6 x's. It used to be sooooo good too!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Dont take my word...try it! Lasagna is good. Philly Steak sandwich is to die for!  Pizzas are Cheesy and delicious!  They have Desserts too! Variety of Sodas. The owners are AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Moved to the neighborhood and was hoping to find a locally owned and operated pizza place. I was looking for flavorful pizza with thin homemade crust with fresh toppings and some mild chicken fingers with homemade ranch and what I got was cardboard crust with a splash of basic pizza sauce and a dash of cheese. The guys taking the order are not welcoming or friendly. They made me feel like it was a huge imposition that I walked in to place my order vs calling ahead. The menu selections are massive. My advice would be to scale back the selections and at least do one thing right...like the pizza. Oh and maybe be friendly when we walk in to place an order. 

I was disappointed and won't go back"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and very disappointed. Food was terrible, pizza tastes like it was reheated and was burnt  (owner's response: \"it's not burnt, it's brown\"). I wanted a refund for the pizza (I didn't need a new pizza, just my $6 back) owner said \"no refunds\" which btw was not listed anywhere. I asked where it was listed and he got upset and called the police on me \(-_-)/ lmao! Even the police agreed the pizza was burnt. I will never eat here or recommend this place. They turned a simple situation into a huge ordeal."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this pizza place for the last 13 years. I believe there have been several changes in management and ownership.
Yesterday I ordered a special that included two lasagnas bread and a small salad. They told us that we would receive it in 45 minutes.
It took an hour and 10 minutes to receive it and we live across the street. Then the tin plate that holds the lasagna was not even a quarter
full of the lasagna. The side of the tin was burned and the food was watery and chips of burned cheese
was mixed in my food. The only thing tasty unfortunately was the bread. No napkins, no forks get the
pucture??? My husband likes to cook and I think I will avoid coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Plain and simple....food sucks! Pizza Is ok but far from good bread sticks suck and matzerella stick are garbage! Find another place to eat is my opinion"}
{"text":"Food was good, they just forgot to deliver my drink. Then I had to explain to the driver that I did order a drink and he had forgotten it. After that, he called at around 6:45 PM to say he would deliver it after hours cause he was busy. I said that would be fine but I was pretty annoyed, then at about 7 PM I was told another driver would bring it sooner (I also had to explain that I had gotten the soda). I was fine with that. It's now 7:45 PM and still no drink. I won't be ordering from here for a long time."}
{"text":"Ordered BBQ wings and Bread sticks, the kids didn't feel like pizza.  The delivery took well over an hour. The wings were tough and piled with an unnecessary amount of sauce.  The Bread sticks were ok.  My daughter referred to the wings as un edible and asked me to please never order there again. Since we didn't get our order until 930 pm I wasn't going to complain."}
{"text":"What this place does to pizza shouldn't be done to dog food. I admit, I can be a pizza snob. I like Rosati's and the more authentic ma and pop places. But I'm also fine if I have to settle for Pizza Hut, or in a real jam, Dominos. But this place takes the prize for truly the worst pizza I have ever had. I'm counting the cheap frozen pizzas into this. Seriously, avoid. Very bad. Very, very, very bad."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place almost 6years. I only order a handful of things.

Manhattan Calzone (VERY HUGE!)
10\" meat express
Gyro
Hot wings

This is the only pizza place I like bc it has flavor. Every topping contributes to every flavorful bite. Something I can't get in a commercial chain. The only thing is THEY SAY ground beef is apart of the ingredients but they never put it in there. (I'm glad), so I usually say, \"No ground beef, add tomatoes\". Well.....he charges me extra for that. Beef cost waaaay more than a few chopped tomatoes! Also, if you pay attention,  they kinda make up their own prices on that register. I've saved my receipts, ordered the same thing and they always differ by atleast 50cents. I still like their food. Plus the cook always checks me out. That's usually when my bill is less. Haha."}
{"text":"$5 pie and 2 minutes from work... can't argue with that. A friend and I get this at least once a week. The pie isn't impressive to a Native New Yorker but, for 5 bucks it's a steal. They'll deliver, but I think it's with a $10 minimum. No one is ever smiley or friendly in here and the inside is nothing special. They charge me $5.50 every time and if I'm correct on the tax rate, that means they're making 10 cents extra on every pie. I'm not going to argue over 10 cents but it's a peeve of mine."}
{"text":"That is sucks doubble price for delivry . I only 1 mile far im at work so i cant leave my job , that's realy sucks"}
{"text":"Not bad for the price! $5 for a Big pick-up Only is not bad at all. I Loved the fact that it wasn't greasy especially compared to Little Carsars or Pizza Hut! It was $5, it was 8 nice slices, it was NICE!!!"}
{"text":"While I was ordering over the phone for delivery service I almost canceled my order because the gentleman taking my order was extremely rude.  I am sorry that I didn't.  I ordered a special--pizza, wings and soda.  When the order arrived, I was overcharged and did not get my soda.  The delivery driver was nice but could not do anything about the price or the soda.  He said however that the soda didn't come with the special because I had ordered pizza with pepperoni on half and pineapple on the other--apparently this counts as two toppings. The pizza has very little taste and the wings were so dry and hard that they were inedible.  I will NEVER purchase pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Service is great and good prices! They have tons of specials and their philly cheese steak is amazing!! Very delicious! Definitely worth coming back :)"}
