{"text":"Very good breakfast,  great service,  good portion.  They got my smoothie wrong,  ordered watermelon got strawberry...  Assumed when they figured it out and said sorry that they would credit it from the bill,  but they didn't...  Ask for hot chocolate instead of the included coffee and they charged a 3$ extra...  So turned out being an expensive Breakfast but very good.  It kinda smells funny from we get in,  at first I thought it was cigarettes but then I notice it might be the wood stove...  Very good food overall..."}

{"text":"Beautiful day, we sat on the terrace for the first time for spring 2015. Good atmosphere outside, as there was a group booked inside and it was extremely loud, therefore a loss of a star.  The food was very good. The wood fired oven made for a great pizza. The mozzarella entre was excellent. I would recommend this restaurant, especially the terrace.  Don't forget to bring your own wine, as they don't have a liquor license."}
{"text":"Très bon déjeuner avec des assiettes généreuse. La pizza déjeuner est exquise.   Le décor est vraiment beau et original par contre lorsqu'il y a beaucoup de monde l'écho devient assourdissant."}
{"text":"After trying to find a breakfast joint that would take our reservations for Mother's day, I ended up making reservations at the Grange Urbaine.   Easy to find, nice look from outside.  The place was not \"packed\" as one would expect on Mother's day, but the sound was deafening; was probably the pine planks that covers walls and ceiling, but to me, it was truly uncomfortable.  It took a long while for anyone to come to our table, if only for coffee, and another long moment until the waitress took our order.   Food was good, well done, seasoned just right. Good enough quantity as well.  The owner came to our table often to apologize for the long wait, everytime saying it was to be expected to since it was Mother's day. Yeah, everyone there knew that, and furthermore, its the same every year... I don't understand how a restaurant does not manage its kitchen with that in thought. And the place was not nearly as packed as I have often experienced.  Bottom line, we might go again, but will eat on their nice terrace so we won't get buzzing ears."}

{"text":"Solid restaurant, I had breakfast here a few times. The menu isn't anything to brag about but there prices are reasonable! And it's a nice place for groups. For breakfast they serve up the traditional stuff from eggs, bacon, ham to French toast and crepes.  I can't really score this higher then a 3 though. Only got to try there breakfast dishes, but u heard they make a mean pizza! With a wood fire oven. The service is a little slow but other then that it's a cool spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Located off the busy Laurentides boulevard, La Grange Urbaine can be easy to miss and this is something that must be avoided as one can enjoy a really nice variety of good grub depending what time of the day you show up.  For my visit, it was for brunch but they also offer Italian styled meal options for the evenings that looks mighty tasty! They also provide Brio, an amazing Italian styled soda that is practically my kryptonite!  I went with their \"Speciale Du Boucheron\" which consisted of eggs, toast, potatoes, sausages, beans, bacon, ham and so forth. Why live to 40? The bacon were crisp and tasty. The ham and sausages were flavorful. The eggs were done just right. The potatoes were addictive. All in all, it was a really good breakfast and worthy for a re-visit, even perhaps a supper.  I did find that the breakfast portions weren't comparable to the other places we can get breakfast in Laval as this island is the mecca of fine breakfast options with many of them offering huge portions that fill you up and then some! My meal did leave me still slightly hungry which is unfortunate.  If they can provide a larger portion, it would only serve them better as their prices do compete are comparable to others.  Worthy to try out and to enjoy though. Will be back."}
