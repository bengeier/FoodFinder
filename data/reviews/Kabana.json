{"text":"Skip this place.  Terrible customer service , terrible food and a messy restaurant.  Why would you go here?  Don't waste your money. Send a message by taking your dollars elsewhere.  Mom and Pop mentality does not work in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most disgusting places I have ever been in Mississauga. Dirty, dirty, dirty. We could not even eat the food we ordered after we enter the to the washrooms and sit on one of the dining tables. Just disgusting. Even a rat would have problem eating here."}
{"text":"people are great and good is amazing. newly renovated and i feel like it's a completely different place than before, now offer paan/falooda etc"}
{"text":"I was their the other day to get some sweets. The restaurant was clean but I am not sure about the food.

The server was pretty friendly and as I gave her instruction to make me 2 boxes of sweets (mithai). I tried their Gulab jamun - which were quite nice and soft
Laddu - this wasn't a regular laddu but it was made of crushed dry fruits and stuff and was tasty and healthy
There was one more _____ cake - cant remember the name which was pretty decent too.

The desert section have good choice and their food menu was good as well. I saw a lot people picking up their take outs, they have lot of seating as well.

This restaurant serves halal food and has a sign on their front door."}
{"text":"Reviews aren't looking so hot for his place but I don't know...I always seem to leave with some pretty good tasting food ?

It's actually a go-to place for my co-workers and I. Whenever we decide to get together, we order a bunch of items in advance and have someone pick it up. But..sometimes they don't have it ready so there's still a waiting time. Another but...food has always been good! 

I feel like they probably treat regular customers differently than they would a walk-in and really depends on who's working. I don't think I go there often enough for them to know who I am but I've got a couple times with just my sister and service has been horrible

I would still give it a 4 star though cuz it's still a go-to place for my coworkers and I, and they haven't disappointed yet."}
{"text":"**HORRIBLE** I placed an order through skip the dishes. 15min later while the driver is on his way, They called and said they are missing a roti and dont have the Daal Makhni. They will be give me some naan and some roti and also replace my order with Chanaa masala. I told them to at least keep it all naan and not mix and match and give me anything else (I will pay the difference). The conversation is pretty calm so far. Some older dude grabs the phone from the girl and starts yelling at me on the phone as If I owe him money. He is like \"take what we have OR cancel the order\" and \"we have no other dishes in the whole resturant\". I had already paid for the order and I'v waited 20 minutes by now. ** Extremely rude management and subpar food** DO NOT ORDER and TAKE YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE."}
{"text":"Ordered their chicken biryani.. It was mediocre nothing to brag about. Their sweets on the other hand is something to brag about. Nonetheless it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"Had the butter chicken, it was alright not the best I have had but it hit the spot. They do have an all you can eat bar in the restaurant, so if you want to try different Indian food you can."}
{"text":"Absolutely pathetic behavior and food quality. Ordered home delivery via skipthedishes and after a wait of 1:30 hours got served stale meat and food. Had to discard almost 50$ worth food. Have officially filed a complained with the health and safety department. When i called in the owner he started yelling \"do what you want\". Do yourselves afavor and skip this restaurant at all costs."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Canada and my colleague took me to this place. I tried their Kababs and they were really good. So I went again and tried their buffet and it just hits the spot. I will recommend this place to any one who doesn't mind some good quality food."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The most bullshit desi restaurant ever. I will never advise anyone of you to waste your time here. The owner is disrespectful as well."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for weekend breakfast special of halwa puri. The puri itself was very good. The halwa looked like chutney to me according to appearance. Taste was ok. The Chanas were just ok. I was expecting more flavor. Was an amateur job cooking them. I was rate the breakfast just an ok"}
