{"text":"Worst samosas I have ever had. Doughy and undercooked. Food is horrendous, servers are rude and unattentive."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend to play pool. The bartender told us we needed to leave our ID as deposit. Cool, I handed her my ID. She looks at it then says you know I don't think there's enough space for you to play, we're having karaoke tonight and this area gets crowded. There are a group of guys currently playing on the other table. I then said, I guess we should leave then. She says yes, not even offering us a table and drink. I wouldn't want to assume this was a race issue, but I was absolutely flabbergasted that she literally refused us for no other apparent reason, Other than we didn't fit the \"part.\" NEVER AGAIN!!! (My first yelp review ever btw) so sad."}
