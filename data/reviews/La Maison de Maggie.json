{"text":"Nice place and nice peoples! Crepes are real french crepes, with real wheat flour. Smoothies are good too, and healthy! I know my french place now. I recommand!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for a late lunch on a Thursday afternoon solely based on the great rating. We were not disappointed!  I had no idea they had gluten-free options, so that was a pleasant surprise.  I had the Marion (tomato, mozzarella, pesto) and added turkey for additional protein. It went quickly.   We had our 2-year-old with us, and we shared with her (and \"bought her\" the Tom - Nutella, Banana, and whipped cream to share).  Great atmosphere, lovely owner, and worth repeating. Thanks, Maggie!"}
{"text":"they have gluten free savory crepes!!!!   amazing you can order sweet fillings but better paired with savories!  yay!"}
{"text":"So hospitable and the crepes are the best I've had...   We had the Marion (tomato, mozzarella, pesto) w/chicken, the Lauren (Nutella, strawberry, whipped cream), the Nancy (egg white, turkey, spinach), and the Matt (cheese, mushrooms, chicken). I had a great espresso and they even treated us to a free Alex (pear, caramel, cinnamon). All absolutely delicious!  Had interesting conversation about France... and they use imported French flour (less processed, no bleaching). The kids absolutely loved the French imported Kinder chocolate eggs with toys in them. Would totally recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Yummy buckwheat (naturally gluten-free!) crepes. And Nutella & strawberry (wheat-full) dessert crepe. Very helpful owner, clean welcoming decor complete with quote from The Little Prince on the wall, in French!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place, the crepe are very tasty and have savory and sweet options, they are not too rich in flavor and they don't have tons and tons of butter, I ordered the Matt crepe and it was delicious"}
{"text":"Incredible!!! The Galettes are to die for! Great portions, satisfying, and healthy! Smoothies are also incredible! And now embarking into dessert with a caramel, vanilla ice cream and walnuts. Uhhhhhhh can't wait for the ice cream to melt in my mouth!!! Booooom!!!"}
{"text":"Many years ago (1980 to be exact) I lived in southern France in a little village called Siros outside of Pau. I was an 18 year old exchange student living with a basque family of 10. Every day I had crepes! They were waiting when I came home from school around 1 pm.  I fell in love with crepes!  Maggie's crepes had me reveling and time traveling back to those days. . Excellent crepes. Perfect earl grey tea.  Super friendly staff. The savory crepes are made with buckwheat so they are gluten free.  The ingredients were fresh and complimented each other very well.  Love this spot!  Highly recommended! bravo!"}
{"text":"Sooo worth it to get away from all the greasy food on the strip to this bohemian cafe in Summervile. Here I found not only the best food I had on my trip (savory crepes were to die for), but the best crepes I've had in America. Excellent coffee and Maggie make this place an absolute delight."}
{"text":"Great traditional french crepes, savory and sweet. Owner operated and incredibly nice. Also available are homemade jams."}
{"text":"Outside the cafe, the handwritten script on the menu board evoked a vague but pleasant memory, and inside, we realized that we had once again been transported to France. On an interior wall, the handwritten script continues with passages from the Little Prince, \"One sees clearly only with the heart. The essence is invisible to the eye.\" The charm of this place began even before the first bite, and the authentic gallettes and drinks complete the dream. We will return to this place on every future visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"My absolutely new favorite place in Las Vegas. Beautiful intimidate cafe. Delicious coffee and smoothies of every combination you may think. But the best part of course are the crepes! The owner is the sweetest lady, and she makes you feel extremely welcome. They sell imported products from France by the entrance, and their ingredients are also imported. If you want to meet francophones, this is also the best place to go. French speakers walk in and out constantly throughout the day."}
{"text":"Best crêpes in town and we have been there several times!  Everyone should start with a gluten-free, organic, buckwheat crepe and finish with a sweet crêpe, my fav one being the Lauren with nutella, strawberry, and whipped cream. Note that even the whipped cream is homemade!   French natives, visiting regularly, are adding to the authentic atmosphere ...  \"Merci beaucoup\" to the French chef, Maggie !!!"}
{"text":"Came here because we couldn't find the place we intended on going to- lucky us! Both the sweet and the savory dishes we chose were awesome. The Alex (pear and cinnamon sweet crepe) was sooo delicious- wish I would have added a scoop of ice cream. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic taste and fresh ingredients, wonderful!  I ate there three times in one week, I'm hooked. Great coffee as well."}
{"text":"They have amazing and authentic French style crepes. The staff and service was very good!"}
{"text":"Loved the buck wheat flour, we got the special and the Lauren, both crepes we ordered were delicious!"}
{"text":"The strangest experience ever.  Nice little place, a little bit too dark for a lunch hour, average food, watery americano and no half and half. What really captured our attention is that cashier, order taker, barista, probably dish washer and crepe maker is the same person. Maybe its just wrong timing , all employees called in sick , not sure. Poor lady was running from one end to the other, making coffee, picking up dirty dishes and at the same time making our food. I wish she was wearing some gloves or something. Not impressed. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Had the egg white/turkey/spinach crepe and a smoothie. Both were outstanding. Had a chance to speak with Maggie as well since it was slow. She was very friendly and had some great stories and food recommendations."}
{"text":"Just stopped here for lunch based in a recommendation from a friend and I was not disappointed. Maggie made me one of the best smoothies that I've had in a long time the food was really good too. I had a protein crepe with spinach, egg whites and cheese. Tasted sooo good and very filling too. If recommend moments this place to eat if you're in the area and want to try some French crepes or great smoothies."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I had a chicken/goat cheese/honey crepe....just delicious! The coffee is simply the best! Maggie is sweet and wonderful at making you feel welcome. Her homemade jams were fantastic. I will definitely go back to try other crepes."}
{"text":"La creperie la plus extraordinaire  De Las vegas  Vous allez vous eclater venez vite ."}
{"text":"Little hidden gem! There were 6 of us! We tried 8 crepes and loved each and every one! Fast, friendly service by Maggie, the owner. Cute ambience! Will continue to recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"This morning was a delight!  We had the Marion and the France Crepes. Each came with a small salad topped with a delish dressing. Everything is made from scratch, no mixes. Atmosphere was relaxing and Maggie, the owner, was very helpful in our choices of what to enjoy. We also tried the Alex with pear, caramel, and cinnamon.  Come and experience this authentically French restaurant. Gluten free items and wonderful smoothies, as well.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow - we went here because my wife loves crepes. I personally don't like them. Well - that has changed. The crepes Maggie makes are TOTALLY different. So thin and crispy on the outside but soft in the middle. How you can have that much texture in something so thin, I do not know. But she does it. I ate every bite of mine. We opted for sweet options because we had lunch in a few hours. The savory options looked even more appetizing but we didn't want to fill up.  Seriously 5 stars. Absolutely awesome."}
{"text":"Felt a little rushed,I am not sure my wife had finished chewing when the young lady wisked the plate away, food was very good."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and this place was cute. The atmosphere, the food, and service was great! The owner Maggie is such a sweet heart."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes and galettes. Had an incredible smoothie. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Miss Maggie has a passion for her Crêpes and everything that she makes, and you can taste it. Absolutely delicious savory salmon crêpes, and my girlfriend and I shared the sweet pears crepe. Also we had a smoothie that accented our meal. Beyond superb. Whenever I am in the mood for crêpes, this will be my go to."}
{"text":"Outrageously delicious crepes made with really fresh ingredients and (obviously) lots of love.  Must!!!"}
{"text":"Best Crepes in town. The ingredients are fresh and very healthy. Love the salad bar. You can pick up to 5 items for just $9. What a deal. Everything is made fresh daily. The green smoothie and Chouchou are must try drinks. For people who are very health conscious and have high expectation on food quality, La Maison de Maggie is the place."}
{"text":"Had the Marion and the Alex.  Marion had excellent flavor and the Alex wasn't overly sweet.  Place is adorable!"}
{"text":"My Tahitian friend recommended this place for real French crepes and it didn't disappoint. I tried both savory and sweet crepes with ice coffee. The atmosphere is very Parisian and all the workers speaks French. My service from Julie and Melissa was remarkable. They both were helping me polish my French too. Will be back again and recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"So glad we made the drive out to La Maison. I ordered France, gluten free galette with egg, cheese, and ham. Delicious and filling! I'm gluten free and the owner was so kind to make me a gluten free crepe with Nutella. Yum."}
{"text":"Very nice place and crepes are fresh and very good  Good customer service by the owner Marggie herself  I will go back for sure"}
{"text":"I love this place is an authentic French cusine. The owner is very friendly and all her stuff is French. The walls have quotations of Le Petite Prince- one of my favorite books!   I had Marion Galette and Domi Crepe and Mocha. All of what I other was delicious and looked great!"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic evening. Atmosphere was great food was delicious, I recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"A TRUE GEM! Trust me it's worth the effort to check it out! The charming interior belies the somewhat dark exterior. I'm going to be happy and sad when the word gets out...hope I can still get a table soon"}
{"text":"Best crèpes in town! Beautiful atmosphere, friendly service, and GREAT food. Maggie is kind and accommodating. If you love authentic French crèpes, make this your next stop."}
{"text":"Ammmaaazing stopped by on a lark and had an amazing breakfast. The owner was so so endearing and I loved the Petite Prince quotes on the wall. The food was perfection and I can't wait to come back again with more friends"}
{"text":"Delicious! Better than any crepe in Paris! Love the gluten free options and ambiance. If you're looking for a meal off of the strip, this place is definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Maggie is a doll! My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our lunch. They had crepes and I had a salad. Best salad I have had in a long time!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to go here after reading the great reviews. We were quite disappointed. Buckwheat galettes were dry and almost tasteless (they were tender however). Chicken was little squares of what appeared to be deli meat, Side salad was thinly sliced romaine (that was all) with a tiny drizzle of vinagrette. We've eaten crepes and galettes in many places. These were not among the best. Nice little place, Super clean. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great Crepes worth the stop on way to Red Rock Canyon.  Tasty crepes of good variety and excellent selection of teas as well!"}
{"text":"I never thought one day I would write a review for a food place. I am not a tech savvy guy, so this is my first time writing a review, ever. All I have to say is just come and try it, you will be customer for life. They have really delicious crepes and with Maggie's warm and welcoming personallity, you can't find a better place to an enjoyable family friendly experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic French crepe experience, look no further. La Maison de Maggie serves up quick and delicious, savory galettes (made with buckwheat flour) and sweet wheat crepes. The quality of the ingredients and the sincerity of the workers make for a perfect breakfast or lunch. Plus, they know how to whip up a mean cappuccino. They also offer smoothies but i opted to save that for another time. The decor is reminiscent of a scene from a movie; a tasteful French touch with soft hues and romantic lighting.   I tried the France galette; a classic ham, mozzarella and egg combination, and for dessert, I had the Loulou; a wonderfully sweet vanilla chestnut jam, topped with fresh homemade vanilla whip cream. Seriously, one of the best I've had yet."}
{"text":"I needed two crepes to quench my hunger. It was very good and the staff are very friendly and hardworking. Could use a bit more ambience in the place, but it is new and they are doing good stuff. Very worth the try."}
{"text":"Yummy, Savory and filling!!!  Comfortable and very inviting atmosphere... We will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant shows loving attention to detail and an emphasis on the quality and experience of dining. The decor is simple and elegant and manages to convey a lived-in and homey feeling. The service is excellent and the food and coffee are amazing. We ordered the France galette, the Tom crepe with extra strawberries and ice cream, iced coffee, and regular coffee. They were out of bananas for the Tom crepe and actually went out to get more bananas just for our order.   I will definitely come back to try more items off the menu in the future!"}
{"text":"It's national cappuccino day and I am at the lovely LA Maison de Maggie crepery and I'm tasting this delectable crêpe with a caramel cappuccino. Absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp because my wife needs to eat gluten-free. AMAZING! Both our dishes were wonderfully prepared and presented. We will back while in Vegas."}
{"text":"First, you are welcome in a very cosy, welcoming place with a French touch everywhere! From the French products on the shelves to the walls, to the bathrooms, to the music, I love the details! Maggie prepares excellent Galettes et Crepes and I particularly like the creative recipes and ingredients' association. Merci Maggie :-)"}
{"text":"La Maison de Maggie (House of Maggie) Owned by Maggie Reb is a wonderful little cozy place for Crepes. In fact I adore the little hideaway spot, you might actually miss if you don't spot the sign. The people who work here are very nice. And very respectful. And French! Or Jewish French. As Reb is a Jewish name in Origin. What a bonus! Anyway, my order was a Nutella filled Crepe. I usually go to this Asian lady on South Fort Apache by Kentucky Fried Chicken for the best Crepes, but I wanted to try this out. Something New. Something different. As authentic maybe? Not quite! Honestly, it was very short of what you would expect in France at all. I've been there many times too! Very plain, and mundane Crepe's. It was like toasted pancake with a slab of Nutella, a couple of banana slices and slightly old fruits. The fruits were actually old and mushy. I will admit. The Crepe Wrap is homemade and tasty, though mine was slightly under cooked. This is the main thing that makes these taste so good. Just the Wrap. Throw the rest away. The price was a little above average. The main thing, is my Crepe was small for the amount of money. Maybe I got use to the Football sized ones from the Asian Lady. But at least the Asian Lady uses the freshest Organic Fruits, and Cremes, and stuffs it like crazy, as if bulging out the sides. And it weighs a couple pounds too!. This place makes them weak and small. 1 Crepe and a Cappuccino, was almost 18 Bucks. And didn't fill a bag much for take out. This place can improve alot. And if it doesn't, no matter what the hype, it will vanish in the Desert Wind like many others here do. I will back to update this, when I sneak in again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife for lunch. Love the ambiance, very fresh and simple feel when you walk in the door. We ordered the Nancy, Flying Baby and the LouLou for dessert. Food was cooked fresh and served quickly. Each meal was plated beautifully and tasted even better. The crepe itself was very flavorful and paired nicely with what was put inside. Highly recommend stopping by and giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Tried a couple of different crepes.They were all very good! very authentic french. wish they were open later than 4, great to take the kids after school."}
{"text":"I brought my sister here when she was in town. Really enjoyed the entire experience. The crepes are delicious, my niece had a smoothie she truly enjoyed. The decor is simple, but it takes you back to a French cafe. If your in the mood for a crepes and you live locally, this will be your place to go."}
{"text":"I'm going to add another perfect 5 star review to her growing list of glowing reviews.  We had breakfast here this morning and the food was amazing.  We had the Matt, France and Alex:  Matt - savory buckwheat galette (gf) with cheese, chicken and mushrooms.  It was perfect in every way, diced roast chicken, creamy, melts cheese and sautéed mushrooms, perfectly salted and savory.  France - ham, cheese and a soft egg in the center.  My hubby inhaled it.  Alex - pears and cinnamon sugar.  It was loaded with sautéed pears and not overly sweet.  I want to go back and eat there every day this week.  I heart this place."}
{"text":"Authentic crepes savory and sweet served by the most friendly owner Maggie. The France is my favorite which is with Ham, cheese and egg having that with a cappuccino is a great way to spend your morning, lunch well just about anytime you have time to visit. Before you leave be sure to take home one of her homemade Jams. All three favors amazing at just $7 per jar but the strawberry and basil is a must try."}
{"text":"The owner is very pleasant. We came in on Mother's Day a little over passed 3pm not realizing the store closes at 330 on Sunday. She didn't say anything and took our order anyway. She then sat with us and chatted about everything she makes is with less sugar including her whipped cream (yum) 20% sugar compared to 80% of what you see in grocery stores. We bought her strawberry+basil jam coz it is super delicious.... 1lb of strawberries per jar! It's liquidy coz there's no added preservatives in it. We love this place & cant wait for the peach+mint jam.the owner is the best asset of this place."}
{"text":"What a nice little find. Came here for gluten-free galettes (crepes) and Maggie personally made lunch for us. We had the ham and spinach galette with just the right touch of bleu cheese and the chicken/mushroom/swiss galette was very good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After two savory crèpes and two sugar ones, l feel like coming back asap !!!! Holy Moly, Maggie the owner and cook, knows how to make you enjoy a wonderful pleasant meal."}
{"text":"I think this is on my \"all time favs\" in LV.  I Love the option of buckwheat/gluten free savory galletes,   My wife loves the sweet crepes which are made with wheat flour.  For lunch, I like the tomato mozzerella crepe with turkey.  Will hit this place every time in town."}
{"text":"Traditional savory and sweet crepes. Just like in France. Try the Buckwheat savory Crepes (Galettes in French) and then follow up with a sweet crepe."}
{"text":"I am not particularly experienced with French cuisine, so I can't comment on authenticity. But I just tried this place for the first time and really enjoyed my choice: the Marion galette ($11). It was basically like a gluten-free pizza, with salty melted mozzarella, tomatoes, and pesto. A great light lunch. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We needed crepes this morning before a hike at Red Rock Canyon. Not only did we find the most authentic and delicious crepes here, but we found an adorably decorated French Cafe with an even more adorable French owner and chef, Maggie. This is a must-do in Vegas from now on!!!"}
{"text":"I have a huge appreciation for French food, fashion (Viva Coco Chanel), culture, design, etc. I have eaten and drank? my way through Paris, Normandy reigion and the Loire Valley three times- I love it! So to find a cafe that serves both sweet and savory crepes, plus traditional Butter Sugar Crepes and everything in between owned by someone who is French, makes my heart sing.  I have been here three times and had both savory and sweet crepes. I have always found that what goes into a crepe and the portions can make or break a crepe. They can be as simple as a Butter Sugar Crepe or the delicious Polo Galette- filled with Blue Cheese, Ham and Spinach. The savory crepes are served with a salad as well, so you get your greens. All are made with the French attitude of the love for food, Très Bon!  The patrons and the owner, Maggie, are very French. So don't be surprised to hear the language spoken around you or the lovely French accent of Maggie. If you do have the chance to meet Maggie, while eating a Crêpe and listening to the patrons around you it definitely creates a traditional French vibe . This is a fabulous place- I love it.  Merci, Maggie!"}
{"text":"During  my stay in Las Vegas I ate several times at this French crepery with my wife.  We enjoyed it a lot the food is amazing.  We tried the galettes which are savory crêpes. I had the France with egg ham and cheese and the egg was perfectly cooked sunny side up. My wife had the Marion with chicken and loved it. The good thing about those galettes is that they are made with buckwheat flour (imported from France such as the chestnut jam) so they are gluten free.   The second time my wife had a salad and  it was very fresh and the homemade dressing was out of this world.   Try their coffees and hot chocolate they are just very tasty. Add some homemade (no sugar) vanilla whipped-cream on the hot chocolate, it's the best !  The owner and the staff are French. Maggie is a sweetheart and the dishwasher is so funny. He has a cute  French accent and love to talk with everybody.   Just found out that La Maison de Maggie is now listed on the YelpTop 100 for 2017 as #44, well deserved !!! Go and try it now !"}
{"text":"This found this nice little French crepe please right next to my house. Very delicious. Smoothie is very fresh!"}
{"text":"I just found my favorite French restaurant in town. The food is of course incredible but the owner Maggie who is also the cook has a wonderful spirit. Recommended all day all the time."}
{"text":"Yummy crêpes and galettes. Lovely environment. Lovely time with people. What else would you want!?"}
{"text":"I will return. Very pleasant atmosphere and staff. Straight, lean crepes. My wife who lived in France said it was perfectly French."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had an omelette, which came with a salad (the dressing was light and amazing). I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Real taste of France in Vegas ! Finally !!  Delicates crepes that was awesome really loved the Domi"}
{"text":"Great authentic french crepes, cozy atmosphere, welcoming staff. Great new addition to Vegas brunch scene!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly amazing. My crepe was absolutely amazing. It was a bit on the cold side though. I could not ask for a better atmosphere. Its truly French. The staff is so kind and they speak French unlike some other French restaurants in Vegas. I speak some French and they just treated me with outmost respect when I didn't say something correctly. It's a family owned and operated restaurant and they do an amazing job to make you feel at home. I do recommend this restaurant to anybody who is looking for delicious French Crêpes! I will be back!"}
{"text":"La Maison de Maggie is an authentic French crepe shop located just west of the Soccer Complex, next to Mimosa Gourmet. Prior to finding out about these two places, I thought this complex was essentially dead. A lot of previous shops closed in this strip mall. The only original one left is Arby's. Even Carl's Jr is gone and changed to a Dunkin Donuts. LOL   We had unexpectedly came here after finding out about a 35-45 minute wait next door at Mimosa Gourmet, on a Sunday. We had saw that La Maison de Maggie had a 5 star rating with over 300 reviews. Somethings gotta be good for it to be this highly rated ! So nextdoor we went.   Outside of the shop has a chalk board with specials listed. On 05/20/18, they had 4 specials.   \"Crepe Suzette\"  \"Galette of the Month\" w/ Goat Cheese, Cranberries, Onions, and Walnuts  \"Crepe Nutella\"  \"Croque-Monsieur\"   They regularly have 7 different crepes and 7 galettes [buckwheat and flour made crepes - gluten free] on the menu inside the restaurant. I guess crepes are the sweet type, and galettes are the savory type? I totally skipped out on looking at galettes when I was there cuz I saw it was gluten free XD oops. Little did I know, that was what my friend had highly recommended in his review....  This place is the 'you place your order at the cashier and take your seat' kind of a café style. It was fairly quiet on Sunday early afternoon but soon after, it became busier. Lol   The restaurant is quite cute. I'm not sure how to describe it. Mildly rustic. French styled? They had a side facing clock like what you'd see at a train station too ! Dimly lit.   I had ordered the 'Crepe Suzette' whereas my friend had ordered the 'Lauren'. She had ordered a normal iced tea whereas I had ordered a 'Micka' smoothie  'Lauren' is a wheat flour crepe w/ nutella, strawberry, and whipped cream  Of the two crepes we had, this was really delicious. Crepe was fairly thick and folded. Thin layer of nutella and slices of strawberry inside the crepe. Light whipped cream piped outside on the plate. Simple but delicious.   'Micka' is a smoothie w/ spinach, kale, pineapple, grapes, flax seeds, and agave  Simple smoothie with the above listed ingredients. They didn't blend it enough so it was still kinda chunky and hard to drink with straw.   \"Crepe Suzette\" w/ zesty homemade orange jam and Grand Marnier liquor  I was warned there was liquor in this when I ordered it which I was fine with. I had expected as much with it listing Grand Marnier which is an orange liquor. I know I've heard of 'crepe suzette' before and I think its a fairly known \"crepe\" in France. So that's what I got.   Little did I know they were gonna bring out the crepe with the zesty homemade orange jam inside on a plate... then the Grand Marnier lit in a pot, pouring it on top of the crepe at tableside. I didn't expect how much liquor they'd use... They drenched the crepe ! it was swimming in liquor ! I know some people wouldn't complain about that... but ugh all I tasted was liquor. I don't know if the crepe soaked up and I ingested it most of it in the beginning, or I got used to it, the crepe tasted better later on. I noticed the homemade jam was really tasty but wished they were a little lighter handed on the amount of liquor. I cut a small piece for my friend to try and she had instant regret. INSTANT. LOL her face scrunched up so fast. XD it was borderline bitter with the amount of alcohol. I didn't know Grand Marnier was flammable. I feel like they mixed it with something to light it. I can't dock rating for something I was warned about. The orange jam they used is really delicious with seemingly candied orange peel in it too. I believe all their jams are homemade so I cant wait to try other ones they have !   The owner, Maggie, was super nice. She was the one who took order order, did my crepe suzette, and ran out thanking us for the $2 bill tip we left on the table. What a funny person ! Would love to come back and try the galettes and other crepes ! too bad they close by the like 3-4pm so it definitely not during a weekday/workday."}
{"text":"Ok so they ship their flour all the way from France. You got the real deal here. Savory crêpes are to die for!!!  The loulou sweet crêpes is awesome if you want an authentic french savor. Recommended if you want a good culinary french trip. I drove all the way from Henderson to go there and it was worth it"}
{"text":"The food is great and Maggie herself is awesome. This one woman show provides a delicious and highly personalized dining experience.   The menu is very simple... savory crepes, sweet crepes, and salads. Everything is freshly prepared to order and fully customizable, so you can pretty much get anything you want in your crepe. I've pretty much tried all the savory crepes and several of the sweet ones and have never been disappointed.    Maggie is truly passionate about her food and it shows.  Great little neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Maggie is delightful.  The crepes were to live for. We drove 18 miles to get here and we're not disappointed.  The Polo crepe was my favorite of the two we tried. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Im originally from France and im very picky about french food. This place met my standards. I had the Matt and the Loulou. Both delicious. Maggie was very pleasant. Worth trying both savory and sweet options !! enjoy and bon appetit"}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to off-the-strip fare! The savory crepes are amazing. It was so much fun watching Maggie make the gluten-free buckwheat crepe! She put in plenty of filling and the blue cheese was slightly tart and flavorful...the real deal!!! I must go back now and have a sweet crepe and a latte! This cafe is a must for crepe lovers!"}
{"text":"There is no real crepe place in Vegas, La Maison de Maggie, is the only one, any French person would tell you that she has the French \"savoir-faire\", exactly like they do in Bretagne, France, gluten-free on top of that. Very nice decoration, South-of-France inspired. The smoothies are to die for, and my favorite crepe is the Loulou, for the chestnut lovers. The \"France\" crepe for brunch, or the Marion for a taste of France with tomatoes, basil and mozzarella! Run there !"}
{"text":"Authentic French crepes, fresh and imported French ingredients.  Made fresh to order, excellent and friendly service.  I will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing food, the woman is very sweet!! Definitely worth the trip to check them out for a brunch!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we weren't happy with our Mother's Day experience. I so wanted to be. The owner and her employee were nice and tried their best to accommodate the large crowd, but service suffered. We were there forever. Not sure why only 2 people were working on Mother's Day.  Main cons: The coffee was really poor and the girl looked confused when we asked for sweetener. I basically spent 4 bucks on a latte I didn't drink. Also she said she had almond milk but told me when she brought my drink that they didn't have any left. She made it instead with coconut milk without asking me. Whatever.  Next, to be blunt..... The food just wasn't good. I was surprised since the owner is French and seemed to have some other decent reviews. I had the Sophie, my husband had the crepe of the month and my son ordered a sweet crepe with Nutella.  My crepe was a buckwheat batter and dry. I knew it was going to be buckwheat but expected a soft fluffy texture with cheesy oozing toppings. The cheese was not melted and the veggies lacked flavor.  My husbands pears were not mascerated in anything and they had no flavor so the Gorgonzola was very unbalanced. All salt no sweet.  My son had a sweet crepe -hard to go wrong with Nutella, but it wasn't as good as expected either.  Aside from the food, the sweet young girl employee was wearing thongs,as in flip Flops. Just not appropriate in a kitchen/cafe. Cheapens the place.  Sooo, not sure what to think. Hard when people have a nice concept, but no knowledge of the restaurant or hospitality industry to run a business.  Would've been less stars if they weren't friendly. Sorry ladies, we tried."}
{"text":"Delicious French crepes and a lovely owner. I had a crepe with chicken, cheese, and mushroom and it was very tasty. Every ingredient had a very rich and distinct taste and combined for a very flavorful meal. Will be back again."}
{"text":"A little gem for delicious healthy eating! Occasionally Yelp leads you to a place you would have never found on your own.  Thank you Yelp for leading me to La Masion de Maggie! Maggie is a \"celebrity chef\" from the south of France who imported a little bit of France to Las Vegas.  French Maggie. French staff. French menu. But most important to me- French ingredients (ok, the coffee is from Italy!) For the healthier inclined- the galettes (buckwheat crepes) are made to be meals.  Delicious, filling, nonGMO gluten free meals. Like most Americans, I used to think of buckwheat from buckwheat pancakes- but more recent digging on my part has discovered what a \"superfood\" buckwheat is (see link below).   For the less healthy inclined- the imported French wheat crepes are a bit sweeter and have dessert toppings. French wheat is naturally low gluten and most 'gluten sensitive\" Americans have discovered they can eat French wheat with no problems.  At last you can eat delicious, organic, GMO free meals with no worries. Every mother in SW Las Vegas should be dragging her kids here every day! The ambiance is great. Maggie is a kick and the other staff I have seen here are either from France (or Quebec perhaps which works for me too).  Stop in and see Maggie (et ses amis) when you want a delicious inexpensive bite (or Italian cup of coffee) with no worries attached.

{"text":"Yummy crepes! We had the ham and cheese crepe and a strawberry and whipped cream crepe, both were amazing and tasted very authentic. The coffee was good as well. Maggie the owner and her assistant Leticia were very friendly and welcoming. There isn't much ambiance, but the crepes make up for it!"}
{"text":"The food is perfect 5/5. The staff is super friendly. The decor is such a cute country French style. The only thing I would say is that the dimmed lights gives you the feel of the restaurant not doing well when it clearly is."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of my favorite places in Vegas. Maggie's food is amazing and she is an incredibly sweet person. My girlfriend and I have tried half the menu already and haven't found an item we haven't enjoyed yet - very yummy food, great atmosphere, worth the price"}
{"text":"Maggie was so awesome. Friendly even though we were there at lunch time and the place was super busy. I had a crepe filled with strawberries and caramel( substitute for Nutella) my husband had a galette filed with turkey,spinach,and blue cheese. They both were outstanding. I strongly recommend everyone try this gem."}
{"text":"Definitely a great experience! Cute little appt with wonderful ambience. I would recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and everything was great! The owner is working by herself which for me is a definite plus in my books as I'm a waitress myself. She explained the different types of crepes, ingredients and so forth. Coffee is good too! Love the set up and the overall experience I had here. I chose the Polo which had gorgonzola cheese, spinach and ham. it's pretty dang stinky but yummy. Thats the only way I know how to explain it lol. Mom had the Matt which consisted of cheese, mushroom and chicken. I tasted hers too and it was very good. Try this place out if you want lunch or have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Loved Maggie's place! The atmosphere is really and cozy and Maggie is very friendly and sweet! The menu has dishes for meals and dessert, coffee and smoothies. My brother absolutely loved the Marion crepe. Fun place to eat at, definitely a 5/5!"}
{"text":"Super yummy, very glad I stopped by! This is such a cute place with a welcoming vibe."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I've had such a wonderful crepe. The food is fabulous. Absolutely a place I will return to."}
{"text":"I'm digging all of the cute little French spots that are popping up in this area lately! I've been going to Rosallie pretty regularly but they don't do too many heated dishes, so Maggie's is here to fill the gap: menu includes both sweet and savory crepes made to order, and some coffee and smoothie beverages for a bit of something extra.   SOPHIE: Mozzarella, red pepper, and mushroom. Simple but so good! BF inhaled his portion while I savored mine. It was hard to decide what to order because all of the options sound good, definitely coming back to try more! LOULOU: Vanilla custard jam and whipped cream? Yes please! I'm not a huge crepe fan, or much of a dessert person, but I really enjoyed this option, which is one of the simpler offerings.  ICED COFFEE: Great brew, served in a double-wall tumbler for dining in, refills were offered. This was just strong enough, and made me interested in trying other caffeinated drinks on my next visit!   Location isn't noticeable from the street, tucked into a small plaza with a few vacant spots. Service was super-sweet and interior is cute and rustic. I can see myself coming back frequently to experience the great food and service.  TIP: Check in when you walk in, there's a Yelp offer for 10% off. You can get one savory option, one sweet option, and a drink for under $20. Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes. Try both the sweet and the savory they are delicious and exactly what a quality French breakfast should taste like"}
{"text":"Excellent! Limited menu of crepes only, but excellent! I have spent time in France and this is the closest thing I have found in the states, I will be back again and again. Note to owner: quiche would be an good add to your menu and increase frequency of return trips"}
{"text":"If you like France  and you like to eat healthy then you have arrived.   Maggie makes all her Crepes with organic veggies, meats, and cheeses   They have buckwheat crepes that are savory and sweet.   They are offering wine now, and they have a selection of French treats. Great coffee also."}
{"text":"Love the option of buckwheat/gluten free savory galletes, but my heart lies with the sweet crepes which are made with wheat flour. We recommend the Marion and the Tom, respectively.   We also had a vanilla latte and a Cheryl smoothie which were fantastic.   The owner is a sweet woman from France and you can tell everything was selected and made with love. She makes her own whipped cream (no sugar, just vanilla) and her own pesto sauce.   The decor was adorable and reminiscent of a small cafe in France. Overall, we enjoyed the food (and we loved chatting with Maggie) and hope this place starts building up its clientele because it has the potential to do really well!"}
{"text":"If you like real french crepes .. That's the place to go ! Maggie is very friendly open mind and know how to cook in the pure french tradition  Prices very affordable"}
{"text":"Maggie is wonderful, and her crepes and gallettes are too! Fresh ingredients, with love and warmth - something one does not find as readily anymore. There is simply something magical about eating here. I am so very glad I finally had time and place match up to allow me a little slice of heaven.  Note: location can be a bit tricky to find, but trust me- you will be happy you found these crepes and the uber sweet Maggie!"}
{"text":"Simply the best!   The best crepes I ever tasted .  I will strongly recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family.  Thank you Magi"}
{"text":"This place was such a great find. I had one savory crepe (France) and one Easter special crepe (marshmallow and Nutella) and they were both so fantastic. It was a nice mellow environment at the time, though I'm sure it could get crazy sometimes. Even then, I'd be happy to wait for more of the crepes. My girlfriend had a smoothie (Micka) and salad as well and they were also very delicious. She said she would've paid for a bowl of the mushrooms in her salad alone. Eat here as soon as you can if you haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Always wonderful food, service and french music. This place is the real deal. They have gluten free flour you can use for sweet or savory. Oh and they have $7 mimosas!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, the absolute best cappuccino and the owner was able to snap my very cranky and tired 8 year old daughter out of a bad mood with a jam tasting! The homemade jams are delicious.  Everything is fresh and made in front of you. I enjoyed the crepe with mozzarella, tomato and homemade pesto. Again, the best cappuccino I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Delicious, original, great quality, friendly, big smiles. Everything and everyone here is 5 Stars!!! Plus they are a good gluten free breakfast tasty alternative. Thank you."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5  Setting: 4/5 Value: 5/5  It's one of these authentic hidden gems you must try out! There aren't that many in Vegas.   The crepes and the smoothies are delicious. If you're looking for the crepe experience just like in France, this is the place! (I'm French). If you're looking for an Americanized version, you may be disappointed. For example, you won't find any ketchup at La Maison de Maggie, but you will find French mustard. The flour is imported from France, and you'll even find gluten free options. The smoothies are so fresh - made with fruits/veggies picked up at a local farm.  The restaurant closes too early to my taste (6pm), but Maggie is alone and does everything herself. Given the quality of the food, it's ridiculously cheap (a savory crepe = a full meal = less than 10 bucks). I hope Maggie raises her prices because I want her to stay in business!  I wish the place was a little more decorated, but Maggie is so friendly she warms up the atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely a five star experience! Real France Crepes made with love by Maggie the owner. Their Cappuccino is superb their Tea selection is endless , Savory and Sweet Crepes , gluten free Crepes Yumm The French atmosphere takes me back to Paris ."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker of French food (but not expensive one :p). Just found this restaurant on yelp and loved it! My son ate slices of tomato and he enjoyed it! They ate most of my galette but I'm ok. Now I know how to feed him tomatoes that is priceless. We had such a quality time here at La Maison de Maggie. Merci beaucoup for making us feel at home!"}
{"text":"Crave a crepe? Well, THIS is the place! A genuine French taste, nice ingredients combinations, savory and sweet flavors... You're delighted even before your first bite! Thanks Maggie for your warm welcome and your hard work during all these months. Let me tell you it worths it. Well done and I wish you a great success and a whole bunch of happiness with your new project. May the whipped cream be with you!"}
{"text":"Crepes were delicious! The owner/chef was so sweet.  She was very informative about the crepes and even helped us choose what to get. The crepes appear small but they are so satisfying and the coffee is smooth and delicious.  I ordered the savory crepe and I was so full off of it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The owner is from Provence, France so she definitely knows crêpes. The ambiance is cool with French Hip Hop music playing in the background     My wife and I shared a Marion Galette and the Alex Crêpe. It was enough to fill us up.   The flavour was so good. Reminds me of the crêpes we had in Paris.   Thanks Yelp for pointing this place out."}
{"text":"By far the best crepes I've ever had. I had the \"Sophie\" which was a beautiful savory crepe. Will be a new regular spot for me!"}
{"text":"Yummy ! Very cute, casual place:) authentic French crepes, all homemade. They also sell unique homemade local jams . The sweet French ladies are very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Great place... Great Crepes... Great service!  Plus it is clean. I liked the savory & sweet crepes.  Reasonably Priced."}
{"text":"This place is great if you are gluten free. I has the egg ham and cheese gf galette and it was fab!"}
{"text":"don't really understand why this place has so many good reviews... the restaurant itself is beautiful inside (and has amazing reviews), so you walk in with high hopes. but beware - the food is WAY overpriced and awful. we ordered the crepe suzette which was a special at the time. it came out with beautiful presentation - our waitress poured flaming orange liquor over top - but it tasted like a soggy paper towel dipped in whiskey. (maybe it is different in france but.. i always knew the crepe suzette to be lemon and powered sugar?) we couldn't even eat it. the other dish was the savory crepe with egg white, turkey, and spinach. the concept was there (sounds delicious right?) but execution was far below par. it was basically a millimeter layer of turkey, egg, and spinach with no sauce wrapped in a burnt buckwheat crepe. we ate it nonetheless because we were starved and just paid 30 dollars for a meal we anticipated to be JUST SO GOOD..."}
{"text":"If you like crepes, this IS the place to come to!  I had the Strawberry Nutella Crepe made by the one and only Maggie from Marseilles, France. . My husband had lemon and sugar.  DELICIOUS!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"As I always say, Maggie makes the best crepes. I recommend all of my friends, family and passersby to come here. The Mochas are top notch too"}
{"text":"Now this is the sort of Parisian experience I'm excited to repeat. I'm very fond of galettes from my experience with a French bistro in Denver and Maggie's have to be the best in Las Vegas. Her galette batter is made with buckwheat flour from France, which is naturally gluten free. She also imports French wheat flour for her crepe batter- glutenous and delicious. Galettes make a perfect savory meal and crepes are great for a sweet snack. Most local places use crepe batter for both sweet and savory applications and that doesn't taste right. In my opinion, caramel is for crepes and pesto is for galettes.  I read over the menu behind the counter and decided to try the Flying Baby galette because it includes blue cheese. Asking Maggie why it is called Flying Baby, she explained that she named her menu items after family members and related a story of her godson in France bouncing around the house with so much energy, earning the nickname Flying Baby.  I took a seat at the bar and watched as Maggie prepared my galette. A few minutes later, my order was ready and she presented my plate. The galette was filled with a lot of melted cheese (mozzarella and Gorgonzola) and warm tomato slices. I love to combine bites of galette with the side of crisp lettuce topped with a perfect French whole grain mustard dressing. It was almost too much food, but I finished my plate and left full.  I'll be back with my daughter to try the crepes and smoothies. I just hope she is not able to reach the shelf of Kinder Surprise eggs, because she is addicted to opening those things. She will come in with a basket and hunt until she finds all the eggs. We'll call her Flying Baby II."}
{"text":"Now let me start off by saying we did not order what they are known for, that is buckwheat crepes. We instead went off Tue special board band ordered croque monsieur. We have ordered that at other French cafe so we thought it would be a good comparison. What came to us was plain white bread toasted with 2 slices of cheese and a slice of ham. The crusts were cut off. A side salad of greens and mustrrad dressing. Needless to say it was a great disappointment. No coffee refills also. I was so,looking forward to another great French cafe but I doubt I will ever go back. If I do it will be for a crepe. By the way Sharrie was going to have a crepe but she hates a runny yolk and when asked if they would cool it hard the answer was scrambled or runny. Not the right answer!"}
{"text":"Fantastic crepes! Place just opened and it's a hidden gem. They need better signage but a nice locally run place."}
{"text":"Found this place online, it was worth the 15 min drive out of the strip.  The crepe tasted very authentic French and the owner is sweet.  I would go back again"}
{"text":"Very adorable place and setup.. Outlets conveniently placed right next to every table, nice quiet atmosphere  The owner is a very sweet and attentive woman. Spent time on our orders and making sure that we got what we paid for.   Me and my sister both got crepes, very moderately priced for the high quality. The taste was above average.   Highly recommend everyone to stop by. My new favorite brunch spot. The cappuccino -- not to mention was also delicious."}
{"text":"The crepes are definitely a great quality and are quite tasty.  Sweet?  Savory?  Delicious.  Major downsides are the price and size.  The crepes are obviously not very filling and they are quite expensive.  These are not really an expensive item to make, or rather, should not be.  The crepes are $8 or $9 a piece and come with pretty much nothing else, so a lunch with 1 sweet and 1 savory will easily be $20 and might not fill you up if you are hungry.  The quality is definitely high and the taste is great though."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning on a friends recommendation, and everything was as good as I was told. Everything is made fresh from scratch, her jams are made from fresh fruit daily. Maggie was very friendly, came by the table and chatted for a few minutes and told us how she makes everything herself from scratch. Very hard working girl, would love to see her have big success with her shop."}
{"text":"Very unique place. They have a simple menu, but the crepes are amazing. Also the smoothies are great as well. We got the Tom and Domi crepes and the Cheryl smoothie."}
{"text":"Review as verbally dictated by our 10 and 12 year olds:  12 year old: Service was amazing.  Every time you needed a server, they were immediately there.  Plates were cleared quickly.  I ordered The Nancy. It had turkey and spinach, not strong or light flavor but just right.  Whoever go in there next, do not forget to sign their guest book at the counter.  If you've never eaten a French crepe, this is the place to go.  10 year old: The Flying Baby has mozzarella, Bleu cheese and tomato. It was too strong of bleu cheese taste so I switched (took the crepe from) with my dad.  He ordered a vegetarian crepe with a girl's name that had red peppers, cheese and mushroom. I liked it thisssssssssss much (with outstretched arms side to side).  If you're in the mood for something delicious, go there."}
{"text":"Awesome legit French crêpes, made with a lot of love and passion and you can taste it. Fresh ingredients and amazing coffees and Smoothies. If you are looking forward to dive into the French atmosphere, stop by you'll have a blast !"}
{"text":"Short version: I love this place! Maggie is wonderful.  She is so nice and has a great sense of humor.  The coffee is well above average.  The tea is fantastic.  The food is spot on. You need this place in your life!  Long version:  Cleanliness 5/5 & Decor 5/5 This place is huge!  Everything has been spotless. It feels like you are visiting someone's very tidy home.  Service 5/5 Maggie make this place even better that it already is.  She's very helpful and patient.  Even when you are just sitting there, she will continue to check in every so often to make sure that you have everything that you need.  You can tell that she has a strong eye for detail with everything in her shop.  It really doesn't get better.  Food 5/5 I ended up here because of the gluten free menu. As a result, I've only had the savory side of the menu.  It's all fantastic.  The tomatoes are fresh.  The crepes are spot on!  She did not skimp on the quality of the cheeses. The side salad is very basic, but I'm okay with that.  My fiance has had the sweeter crepes.  He looked so happy eating it that he got teased a bit.  To me the latte was by far one of the best I've had out here in Vegas.  I bought a can of the loose leaf tea to go because I enjoyed it that much.  This place will probably become a weekly visit for me.  Thanks, Maggie!"}
{"text":"If you're in the area, and are searching for an authentic French breakfast/brunch, stop by and try Maggie's. Maggie is as French as you can get. She makes the food to order and offers mostly takeout, though if you are like me and prefer to eat in, there are a few spacious tables in a quaint homey atmosphere to enjoy.   Menu items are straight forward and she uses quality ingredients which shows through each of her dishes."}
{"text":"\"I will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet.\" - Gandhi  Crispy savory crêpes for the win!   My love and I recently came to La Maison de Maggie with one of our favorite yoga/Yelp friends and I completely enjoyed the experience. I don't mind sharing a sweet crêpe, but it's not something I'd normally order on my own. Savory crêpes on the other hand is a different story... Enter La Maison de Maggie with as many savory crêpe selections as the sweet variety...allowing us the opportunity to order away. I was able to try the France, Sophie, and Matt. These were all savory crêpes and, as such, made with buckwheat flour (the sweet counterparts are made with whole-wheat floor). I liked the crispy, almost overcooked, execution of these savory delights. I wasn't overly impressed with the chicken or ham in these options, but at the inexpensive price I wasn't really expecting to be either.  Maggie was a one-person-show the day we came in, taking orders, making the crêpes, and serving them as well. She was efficient, though it wasn't terribly busy at the time...A couple large groups came in when we were finishing up and I wondered how she would do then. The setting is nice-adorned with pleasing lighting and otherwise simply decorated with a few large pictures. There is also a long counter with seating. The space is finished with a few other items for sale, such as jams made in-house.  I'd come back, as well as recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet or savory crêpe experience."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since they open. I finally had a chance to go today with my boyfriend. I stumbled in around 5:20pm this after noon. 40 minutes before closing. I know they were probably annoyed but the lady was nice enough and told us it was okay if we dined in and enjoyed our crepes.  I ordered the FLYER crepe And I added spinach and an egg to it. It was loaded and filling! The crepe batter itself was very plain and thin. It was just okay. I think I enjoyed the side salad (w/ their HM honey mustard dressing) that came along with it better than the actual crepe.  My boyfriend ordered the Ham, egg and cheese crepe. The crepe was over cooked and the crepe batter was cracking. Not the typical French crepe I was expecting.  I also ordered a hazelnut latte to go along with my meal, and also.... Nothing special. It wasn't sweetened and I had to add my own sugar. :/ I was quite disappointed.... Since this is suppose to be an authentic French creperie. But I will give it another try! Maybe next time I will try their sweet crepes instead! :)))"}
{"text":"What a lovely place!!! The owner is so sweet and the food is just soooo good!! went with my friend after an intense workout for Bfast!!! Delicious !"}
{"text":"I am recently trying a gluten-free diet to try and help calm down my eczema, so I did a quick research on yelp for gluten-free options for lunch with my husband. I got the ham/cheese gallete and my hubby got the blue cheese/tomato gallete. Both plates came with a salad with a light mustard dressing. Both dishes were very yummy, fresh, and light...perfect for a quick small lunch. We ended up having a nice chat with the owner, Maggie, as well. Overall, it was a nice lunch experience. I highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"I visited this  wonderful restaurant today for brunch and was pleased with the warm greeting that met me at the door. The staff are attentive and friendly, and the food is amazing. Many of the ingredients used are organic and most are fresh, and it absolutely shows. I will definitely be visiting again in the future!  My new favorite crepe place! Thank you Maggie for making me feel so welcome!"}
{"text":"Woua it was absolutely delicious patrons were super and the smoothies and so the food was just like back in France :) I will come back for sure :) merci pour les desserts !"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem  This is a perfect example of not being able to tell a book by its cover.  This is a place you go to because you're looking for it, not because you passed a sign that says \"French Crêpes\".  And you should go looking for it.  Their crêpes are great, and very authentic, not only because they use different flour for the galettes (savory crêpes) and dessert crêpes, but because it's organic, and actually imported from France.  The crêpes (the pancake part) have a delicate flavor, with a nice bit of sponginess.  The fillings are fresh and flavorful.  There is also a nice selection of fresh-made fruit and vegetable juices.  Their coffee drinks are also great.  The accent is on fresh fare that leaves you satisfied, but not overstuffed. Decorations are pleasant, without being overwhelming, and Maggie is warm and friendly.  The fact that French natives love to eat here tells you a lot about the quality and authenticity of the offerings at La Maison de Maggie."}
{"text":"Food was incredibly delicious!!!! Very healthy... Maggie the owner was very sweet.  I judge bathrooms and the bathroom here was very nice.   Would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I went today for the 2nd time and come to find out the flour is imported from France!! Who does that and not charge an arm and a leg?? Maggie...that's who! Organic eggs...shut the front door! An amazingly delicious and healthy lunch...yes please! I couldn't have been more satisfied. Thank you...I will be back!"}
{"text":"Real genuine French crepes and galettes.  We felt like we were back in France. My husband had the France galette, and I had the chicken, mushroom and swiss cheese galette. They were amazingly good, tasting just how they did in France. A galette is a crepe made with buckwheat instead of flour, and used with meat, cheese and vegetables. I wanted to try the crepes but I was too full after eating my galette.  We will be back for the galettes and I want to have one of the delicious looking crepes."}
{"text":"We were driving by and the word crepe caught my eye. I literally did a u-turn in the street and stopped by. The food is incredible. Maggie the owner came out from behind the counter to personally talk with us. She is amazing and so interesting. Her food has heart and you can tell she is passionate about her restaurant. She let us know that in April on Friday and Saturday evenings there will be wine. We are very excited to see what else she  will do."}
{"text":"Found this place just randomly on Yelp when looking for something really close to my house. Came to check it out with a friend and we were very impressed. The food was excellent, even the vinaigrette on the salad was very tasty. Love this little place."}
{"text":"Excellent French cuisine. I love the fact that the owner was in the restaurant ready to help me stuff my face. I had the pleasure of trying her organic homemade jams, that were the best I've ever had. The cool thing is she picked the organic fruit herself and made the jams from scratch. What a nice surprise she shared her special creation with us. That is my definition of a great restaurant, where the owner uses food to connect with the customers. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Great service! Good food. We would definitely visit again.  I wish the pear and caramel had more caramel and pear and a slightly thicker crepe."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Great tasty plates and huge portions! So light and delicious! I truly recommend this place to anyone in the area! Met the owner and she is awesome!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely time having brunch with a group of friends today - very friendly service and great crepes."}
{"text":"Everything is so cool, in a very comfortable atmosphere, as a French person, I can say it feels like home ! The Crepes, both savory and sweet are to die for, excellent smoothies and salads, and I will mention the Cappuccino, probably the best in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing French and organic food  If you are looking for an amazing place to eat typical French specialities this is the place to be.  The place looks like a French cafe and you can also buy French grocery products !!! Like candies, syrups, jams and even more.  Even more than that the food is EXCELLENT. I definitely recommend La maison de Maggie to anyone who wishes to have a good time and great food.  I'll be back very soon !"}
{"text":"Nice and quiet little place with such good food. The smoothies here are really fresh, doesn't taste processed at all. I had the Domi, a sweet crepe. so light and tasty"}
{"text":"My mother and father brought me here for Mothers Day and it was wonderful!  French all around!  Great customer service and delicious crepes. Wish you were in Arizona!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful small business that has opened up on the Westside! I'm not sure about other times, but our visit was very.. French lol. We were probably the only non-French speakers in the restaurant at the time, which added to the cafe's charm. Although I was too full to order a dessert crepe, my husband and I each got a galette. They were both filling and tasty, but my unrefined American palette would prefer more sauce (or ketchup lol) so it doesn't taste too dry. I would highly recommend getting a smoothie with your order; the smoothie we ordered was so refreshing and had a nice balance of greens and sweetness from the fruit. The owner was very accommodating and checked on us and other tables often. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"Les meilleures crêpes de vegas. Maggie nous accueille avec un beau sourire et nous sert comme des rois à chaque visite. Un cadre super sympa on se croirait en France en plein milieu du désert."}
{"text":"Just had our lunch here and I must say it was absolutely AMAZING!!!! Their savory crepes are made with buckwheat and they are incredible. You have to try France crepe. The owner is very kind and friendly. It was one of the best experiences I've ever had! I'll be back my my family. That's a great place to start your day."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of savory food, and prior to La Maison de Maggie, I didn't know that crêpes could be savory. My previous experiences had only been with the sweet varieties. Needless to say, I am a huge fan of La Mansion de Maggie.  When you walk in the restaurant you will see two big boards one with \"Buckwheat Flour Crêpes,\" which contains their savory selections and another with \"Whole Wheat Flour Crêpes \" which contains their sweet selections.  I ordered a cappuccino, and \"French\" which is Egg, Ham, and Cheese. I also added Spinach for $1 extra. There is a water station right by the door that is self serve...my love brought our table some water while we waited for our crêpes and my drink. My Cappuccino came in a double insulated cup that kept my coffee hot throughout my dining. Mademoiselle Maggie has three Crêpe cookers on and was manning the kitchen herself, as well as taking and serving all the orders.  All three of us in our party ordered savory crêpes, which all came with small salads with a perfectly balanced mustard dressing.  The Crêpes were a perfect shape and void of burnt edges. The egg on my crêpe came sunny side up egg and sat right in the middle of it.  I love how simple and delicate the crêpe was...no fuss...just an envelope of good ingredients in a perfectly cooked Buckwheat flour crêpe.   I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I'm going a FULL five for this hidden gem.  Maggie is an angel she cooks with love you can tell she enjoys her art. I drove 15 miles because all you guys posted such wonderful reviews, I will be back a true French delight. Good bye Crepe Expectations"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in this cozy french Creperie. The owner is awesome and makes the best crepes in town. Definitely coming back soon to try other items in their menu."}
{"text":"The crepes are very authentic and a complete delight. Their texture and taste are perfect. The ingredients are fresh. All around a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Not just done right, done perfect!   For what La Maison de Maggie lacks in style this place makes up for in flavor. I sat at the bar and ordered two crepes; a savory and sweet. The Nancy (savory) is filled with fluffy egg whites, turkey, and fresh spinach. I'm trying to watch the heavy food intake these days so this was the perfect light lunch meal. All the fixings inside were amazingly fresh, the spinach still had that crunch, the eggs were like soft protein filled pillows, and the turkey wasn't that pressed deli stuff, but sliced fresh gobble, gobble goodness.   The Alli (sweet) was on point, the menu states that this comes with either sugar or cinnamon, but I requested both, sugar on the inside and cinnamon on the outside. This was the perfect cap during my lunch and I highly suggest anyone who comes here to get both a sweet and savory crepe, they have about ten options of each.   I do have to mention, the crepes here taste nothing like any crepe I've had anywhere in Vegas, or beyond for that matter. They're light, soft, and have a delightful sublet flavor. I would even use the word, \"elegant\" to describe these. After I was done I was told that a large portion of the menu ingredients and cooking techniques are directly from Paris and the surrounding areas. I should have known, because the entire staff here has the thickest of French accents.   Seriously, are you a crepe lover? Then get here now!   C'est manifique!"}
{"text":"Based off the reviews, we thought it would be amazing, but we were sadly disappointed. We ordered to-go, and maybe it affected the flavor, but it was super bland and in all honesty, made me feel nauseous. I ended up only eating the mushrooms and chicken from the \"Matt\", but even then it still wasn't good. We walked in on a weekday afternoon and there was no one there. We were able to get our food quickly and leave and the aesthetics were very pleasing, but it just wasn't what I was hoping for. Very disappointed. :("}
{"text":"I had the buckwheat blue cheese spinach & mushroom crepe it was amazing best crepes that  I've had short of Paris"}
{"text":"Maggie is wonderful and her accent is lovely. She makes you feel like you are in her home and eating with her in her kitchen. My wife and I had a wonderful experience and will be coming back for as long as she decides to stay in Las Vegas before leaving for Paris.  Her menu has something for everyone, no matter what you are in the mood for. If you want something hardy and savory, she has you covered...If you are in the mood for something sweet, just take your pick. While we were eating, Maggie stopped by our table to check on us. She explained to us how she imports her flour directly from Paris...and you can really taste the quality, effort, and love she puts into every crepe."}
{"text":"It's rare to see local places like La Maison de Maggie that values quality over quantity. You can never go wrong with this place. Chef Maggie was so nice and welcoming, she had us tried her homemade strawberry basil and peach mint jam.  Your experience in this place will be more than great."}
{"text":"Best crepes ever. The only place I will go. Super authentic and delicious. Great atmosphere and host!! Any other place makes pancake-like crepes, not here. You get the real deal!"}
{"text":"Sans conteste les meilleures crêpes de Las Vegas, l'accueil est excellent, les produits sont de qualité à l'image des smoothies fait avec des fruits frais. Excellent, j'y retournerai."}
{"text":"I really liked the place! Quite European and unique. Nice shirt menu with good ingredients -- also gluten free if desired.  I enjoyed my sweet crepes very much. Maggie the owner, from the South of France is very attentive. We will be back fir the savory choices."}
{"text":"The owner, Maggie is very sweet. When I walked in, this place was packed with people.  I tried the Marion: tomato, mozzarella cheese and pesto. She imports her flour from France. I'm sure I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I highly recommend Chef Maggie to anyone looking to start their day off with a healthy, filling meal.  I am most impressed with the quality of ingredients. Chef Maggie imports all of her flour from France and personally shops for fresh ingredients several times per week. A hand-made meal made in front of me more than exceeded my hopes and filled me up.  And to top it off, she took time from her busy day to share her story. Such a personable and kind person who works hard to make great food. You can hear her passion for what she does.  Take the time to find Chef Maggie and you will walk away full and glad you did!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE this place! The crepes and galettes are delicious, and the handmade organic fruit jam which is seedless is to die for.   Craving authentic French food? Look no further. Why not get it from someone who is French. The decor is tasteful and relaxing too.  One of the best places to treat a loved one to a great meal.  Merci Beaucoup, Maggie!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  love galettes and their buckwheat flavour.  Definitely worth it and The owner is so sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"Amazing French Crepe ! Two of us went to try \" les crepes de maggie \" I took the Polo( bleue cheese , ham and spinash ) hummmmmm ...   my wife tryed the monthly special (goat cheese , mozza, mushrooms, ham ) surprising and very delicious . To finsh we tryed the most fabulous crepe suzette , i never had ,we definitely come back to try every items of the board menu ."}
{"text":"Adorable atmosphere. We were the only non-French speakers in the place. Simple, very high quality ingredients. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We found about this restaurant after reading a review. We had the crepe with mozzarella and blue cheese. It was light and delicious. This was one of the best crepes I had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Really liked this place a lot. The owner was extremely friendly and helpful. She made everything fresh and she even brought me some of her jams/chestnut cream to sample when I commented on it.   I thought the prices were perfectly reasonable as it was a good amount of food and included a side salad. We didn't try the coffee because we had already had coffee elsewhere earlier in the day, so I can't comment on that.  The decor in the restaurant is very pretty. Considering the you order and they bring the food, it's a lovely environment - looks as nice as most full service restaurants. Plenty of parking outside as well.   The savory crepes we had were delicious, perfectly cooked, and we plan to return.  Especially friendly for gluten free."}
{"text":"This is a very authentic version of a crepe, unlike most that you find.  The actual crepe itself is very smooth and light and thin.  The inside is a little light on the ingredients, but you come to a creperie like this for the French cooking not the ingredients.  The coffee was solid as well.    The menu consists of a sweet and a regular menu.  Each meal is about $10 and ingredients can be added at $1 a pop.  I thought the meal was very good and authentic, but unless you have a craving for a true crepe and a non-filing meal, I believe there are better options out there."}
{"text":"Maggie is as fantastic as her food. Everything is organic, I asked. Most of her ingredients are even ordered from France. If you don't eat out anywhere else, do yourself a favor and go to Maggie's."}
{"text":"I studied and lived in France for a short while, and like another Yelper said \"Anyone who is French, or has been to France has a place in their heart for crepes\". This couldn't be a truer statement. So many times, I've given American \"creperies\" a chance to fill the void, and each time I've been sadly disappointed. All the whipped cream piled high makes no difference, to me. When I read the description of La Maison de Maggie on Yelp and saw that Maggie imports her flour from France to make her delicious crepes, I immediately knew that I had to try this place, because anyone that's ever tasted a French crepe knows that the difference is in the flour, NOT the toppings (as many crepe restaurants here in Vegas seem to think).   La Maison de Maggie is the real deal. I walked in on a, thankfully, very quiet afternoon. I didn't feel like dealing with a crowd, but I was desperate for a delicious crepe. Maggie was behind the counter making a crepe for a woman on the other side of the bar. I walked in quietly and gazed at the menu board, although I'd already planned out in advance (through Yelp photos and French experience) what I was going to order.  Maggie greeted me with a smile. She looked very welcoming and kind, with hard work in her face. When she was done making the woman her crepe, she came over to ask me what I would like. I asked for the Alex, for nostalgia's sake, and sat down at the bar and told her I would be enjoying it there in the restaurant. I noticed earlier that Maggie was speaking to the other woman, who had already left by then, in French. I decided to whip out some of my French and we had a great conversation about her time here in Vegas and the hardships of opening her own business here in Las Vegas. She is a hard-working woman who makes the most delectable TRUE FRENCH CREPE I've ever had away from the Homeland. She works by herself during the week and has a little help during the weekends. This business is ALL her.  The Alex has pears, caramel, cinnamon and powdered sugar. It was the perfect amount of sweet that I was craving. The crepe was thin (exactly the way it should be) and had the lightly spongey texture that I've missed so much in the 3 years since I was last in France. The pears weren't soggy inside the warm crepe; you could still feel a tiny crunch in the middle of the slices. The Alex reminded me of a crepe I had when I was young and in love in Paris. What a time in my life!   I'm telling you, the difference is in the flour. If you have any semblance of an idea of what a crepe tastes like, but have never been to France. Scratch it. You know nothing. I mean that in the most \"you have got to try this place\" way. Trust me. Maggie named all of the menu items after her friends and family in France. Everything feels that it was created with love and affection. She tries to steer clear of Yelp, because she is wary of negative comments. She simply enjoys what she does and wants to happily serve the delicious crepes that she creates. I encourage everyone to give it a try. The next time I go, I'll take photos and order a thing or two. My first priority, this time, was to get a foot in the door and try it out. I know I'll love everything on the menu, so now I have a ton of excuses to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been a lover of crepes for the last 25 years, the authentic ones that is, and Maggie's are indeed the real deal.  If you've never tried one, this is the place to start.  If you love crepes already but are disappointed in what you've been able to find, run, don't walk, to Maggie's.  In this city of foodie possibilities, Maggie's is a standout."}
{"text":"Visited this morning and had the Polo, a buckwheat crepe with ham, spinach and blue cheese. It was delicious.  Maggie and her team were very friendly and helpful. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Real french crepes by a wonderful french woman in charming atmosphere.  A real gem.   We had a France, a Matt, a Salad Bar, and a Nutella. All were super yummy, and the vinaigrette on the salad guarantees that you are not suffering by ordering a salad.  I eat mostly plant-based and I am happy to come here to eat a salad and just try a bite of my kids crepe.   Totally worth the drive if you live in other parts of the valley. We drive from Henderson and are happy to do so."}
{"text":"Anyone who is French, or has been to France has a place in their heart for crêpes and now we have a true crêperie here in Vegas. Once you walk through the door you are taken to another place far from home. We are over run by chain restaurants and it is a pleasant change to have a restaurant with its own unique vibe and to hear french spoken again is a plus! In fact come here if you want to put your french to the test!  What I LOVED.... I am gluten free, and I have not seen gluten free crêpes except in Montréal, so I crossed my fingers. Gluten-free often mean tasteless or bad texture, well in this case, I was pleasantly surprised because the buckwheat crêpe was fabulous. In fact, my friend could not leave without having a dessert crêpe and graciously offered to share a gluten free one, and she was impressed as well. Tell your gluten free friends to come here! This is gluten free dream come true!  I had the Sophie crêpe with cheese, red pepper and mushrooms and it was wonderful. The savory ones are served with a small side salad, and there is an option to order a larger salad and you can choose five items.  I have to say, between my meal and the split dessert I was full in a nice way. I try to avoid gut bombs, and I also don't like to walk away hungry. We split the chestnut vanilla jam filled crepe and it was to die for! I heard about the jam from a woman who ate there and buys it from the owner. I also had a latte and almond milk is an option. This is a small place and it is fantastic that they accommodate dietary restrictions.   The owner is from France and imports most of the ingredients, yes it may seem pricy to some, but it makes up for itself in flavor and ambiance.  I love the retail items she had and I kicked myself for not grabbing a jar of the chestnut vanilla jam. That is ok because I plan on returning with my Mom this week because there is a psychic who does readings and they have a special combo with a 15 minute reading!  Say Bonjour to Maggie when you go to eat!   Bon Appetite in my best Julia Child voice!"}
{"text":"I found Maggie's crepe shop by word-of-mouth. Maggie uses ingredients that she imports: the crepes are like the ones in France. I highly recommend this charming cafe."}
{"text":"I got a chance to meet Maggie. She is a wonderful lady that move from south of France to Las Vegas. It took her 20+ months to open since she isn't a citizen. I am glad this place is located close to my house. I would definitely come here more often and highly recommend everyone that loves crêpes to stop by. It's great portion and inexpensive. I would like to add that it's authenticity makes it seems as if she opened a cafe from France and directly imported it straight here."}
{"text":"Amazing flavor combinations, fresh authentic ingredients. Sweetest owner, she really cares about the quality of her food. Really affordable too. Favorites were the Marion and Alex. I can't wait to come back for a smoothie."}
{"text":"First time here and it is really good! I got the Marian and it was delicious. I wasn't in the mood for meat so I went for the mozzarella cheese, pesto, and tomato option. It came with a small salad on the side with a dressing I couldn't identify but it was simple and tasty. It is a small spot and there was only one worker when I came in but I didn't wait long. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Great custom made French food and amazing Lavazza coffee with the personal touches of the working French owners.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We got there around noon on Wednesday.  The place is quaint and inviting and I felt I was in Paris. There were 2 tables ahead of us. You order at the counter and seat yourself. They serve smoothies, crepes galette, and coffee. The patrons will bring the food to you. We sat at the bar and watched our crepes being made by Maggie.  We both had galette (savoury buckwheat crepe) each and they came with a side salad. Crepes we ordered were Polo - ham, blue cheese, fresh spinach and Flying Baby- tomato, mozzarella and blue cheese. You can add any ingredient for $1.  The Crepes were thin and light and flavourful. I didn't get a chance to try their Sweet Crepes. The owner, Maggie introduced her homemade jams and she mentioned her produce were locally grown at Gilcrease Orchard."}
{"text":"Maggie was on duty for our visit. Must agree with other reviewers, she offers excellent crepes with gluten free options. Atmosphere was strip mall sterile as opposed to cozy French chateau. This is a good option if you are in the Red Rock area."}
{"text":"It's a bit frou frou, but this lady knows how a crepe should be made. Very French. Very professional.  Try either the savory or the sweet crepes, with either regular batter, or the whole wheat. Definitely try the coffee.  It is made with special stuff (Illy's coffee, I think).  I hate the complex it's in, and sometimes it feels a bit too \"precious\" in here, but I would definitely go out of the way to check this place out again.  They have French conversation groups here from time to time, too! Ooh, la-la!"}
{"text":"First time here and this place is great! Very relaxed, great music, great crepes, great service!"}
{"text":"Literally, the best crepes in the city. These beat mine, my mothers and everyone else I know. Insane. Crepe Suzette is the bomb but I usually go simple. Nutella and banana. Mmmmmmmm. I dream about this place. Love the owner. Love the interior. Love everything. Go. NOW."}
{"text":"Magge we love the amazing crepes and fun energy you have! This is such a great place! Please bring your fantastic talent and goodness to Salt Lake City! I hope you win awards and grow this place to be the best in Vegas! Much love # 1 fans! Jax and Bri"}
{"text":"A gem!!   The savory crepes & smoothies are awesome. We had to return the next day!  We enjoyed the sweet crepes on our second visit.  Fresh and deliciously prepared food paired with great coffee served in a simply lovely atmosphere.   We plan to return often!"}
{"text":"I discovered this awesome place by chance.  didn't want to pay crazy LV Strip prices for Crepes at hotels.  Went on Yelp and found this place.  NO REGRETS!  this is really really good crepes.  A must try if you are into sweet crepes."}
{"text":"We stopped there having seen the 5 stars review in Yelp. We were not disappointed. Crepes were amazingly delicious. We took 3 galettes (salty crêpes) with different fillings and 1 sweet crepe. Cook owner very friendly. Nice decor."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for crepes. The owner is from France and she only makes her dishes with quality imported ingredients. It's a wonderful place for hanging out with friends or hanging out with yourself and your coffee. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service, and lovely ambiance.  The food here is deeelish! It's authentic French food. The smell of freshly made crepes when you walk in the door is such a comforting aroma that makes me want to come back again  =)"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets!  The décor is minimalistic but it is still reminiscent of walking into a true Parisian patisserie shop.  The owner, Maggie, is warm and friendly and the food is SUPERB.  I love that each table has an electrical outlet beside it as well as hooks for a jacket or hand bag.   So glad to have stumbled upon this hidden gem!  And so lucky that it is within walking distance to our house!!!  We will be back often."}
{"text":"How wonderful it is to have quality food in Las Vegas ! The gallettes are made of buckwheat flour,  so gluten free, and the crepes are made with Francine flour, which is the top of the line ! Even the sugar is organic ! The  owner is all kindness and the staff is friendly and energetic. I was in a hurry and was served within minutes. Definitely a place that I will recommend and bring my friends to. Let's support small businesses that go out of their way to bring service AND quality !!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best crepes that I've had!  Maggie imports all of her ingredients (including the flour) from France, so it's pretty much as authentic as you can get. If I close my eyes, it's almost like I'm back in France.  I've been looking for a good creperie here in the US, and I think I've finally found it."}
{"text":"Maggies is the Best spot you ever will find!! Fresh and Quality ingredients. She uses French Flour and buckwheat flour crêpes as they do in France! Gr8 person and Gr8 Food!! Come check her out!! Delicious!! And gr8 gluten free deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"The owner is as awesome as the crepes! Great environment and satisfying food. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I threw a French themed birthday for my daughter and absolutely had to order the crepes from here. I had eaten here before and the food is amazing. I ordered a large quantity of sweet crepes for first thing Sunday morning...Mother's Day. They were ready, delicious and beautiful. My daughter was so surprised. She was born in Italy and told me she felt like she was home when she finished of her crepe with apricot jam. Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"Des produits frais, des vraies crêpes françaises salées et sucrées dans un cadre cosy. Service rapide et personnel accueillant. A recommander +++"}
{"text":"SCRUMTRULESCENT!!!!  I've never been a crepe fan...but now I see the light.  A friend of mine suggested this place and I will have to thank him for my happy stomach. I had the crepe with pesto sauce and ham and have to say that it was truly wonderful.  Learned while I was there that all the flower is imported from France (where the chef is actually from) and is gluten free.  Truly incredible!  Fluffy and light (two adjectives that shouldn't go together but when they do...magic).  Highly recommend this place.  My only complaint is that it isn't closer to me :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic fresh French food. Maggie loves what she prepare, this restaurant is the cleanest place in Las Vegas. The food is healthy and flavorful."}
{"text":"A \"good friend\" of mine told me about this place. :) Amazing! Service is super fast and they have one of the best crepes I have ever tasted. Would recommend to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"So glad I discovered this little gem on Yelp! Don't be discouraged about its location in a depressingly vacant strip mall. When you walk inside, you'll step right into France and into Maggie's kitchen. The mozzerella, pesto, tomato galette was delicious. I'm excited to come back and bring friends!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  Both times, excellent.  The owner, Maggie, is super nice and friendly.She remembered me from my first visit.  Both times I had the LouLou (LuLu??) with the chestnut jam.  It is so good. I wanted to try the pear, caramel and cinnamon crepe, The Alex, but I didn't know how messy that would be since I was on my way to work and am famous for spilling things on my shirt I decided to play it safe.  Guess I will just have to go back again when I have an extra shirt...oh, shucks! It's very reasonably priced but it's tucked into a plaza behind Arby's and Dunkin' so it is literally a hidden gem worth the search, believe me! Maggie imports the chestnut jam from France and has jars for sale. I bought one of you want to come over for breakfast...The inside is very comfortable. Nice large tables and just cute and inviting all the way around.  Usually you pay first.  It wasn't that busy and Maggie seemed to be working on another order so she just asked me what I wanted and told me to sit down and relax and I could pay after, she pointed out the water and came over to make sure I was happy."}
{"text":"From the outside, this place doesn't look like there's much to it. The only thing that stood out was the Dunkin Donuts and Arby's in this small shopping plaza that is across the street from Desert Breeze Park. However, once you enter this small yet inviting restaurant, you're warmly greeted by the friendly staff. The cool thing about this cafe is the open bar where you're able to watch your crepe being made. It reminded me of the many crepe places in France.   I ended up getting the Nancy Galette (savory crepe) which contains Egg Whites, Turkey, and Fresh Spinach. It was simply delicious and consistent throughout. The buckwheat was not dried out and was soft in texture. I didn't get a chance to try their Sweet Crepes, since I was planning to try another cafe in the area.  As for the Galettes, I would definitely recommend this place. I was able to try the Matt Galette which contains Chicken, Mushrooms, and Cheese. Overall, a great French spot in Vegas!  2017 Yelp Review #5"}
{"text":"I'm from New Orleans....that being said I take my crepes seriously  !!! Service and food was A+ !!!"}
{"text":"Crepes are sublime and done just right... if you want authentic French crepes, you can't get anymore authentic than this place. Owner moved from France last year on her own to share the taste with us. Crepes are $8.00 (savory or sweet) and Nutella, Jam or Caramel $6.00. Delicious smoothies $6.00. The daily homemade jams with just 20% sugar are beyond tasty and they are for sale $7.00. The atmosphere is non imposing and very spacious. Do give this place a try, you will be back for more."}
{"text":"We love these crepes. Good quality! There is a choice for breakfast, lunch or desert. The portions are good but you do not feel heavy after. Late is very good here. Every time we do not feel like eating at home we come. Good job, Maggie!"}
{"text":"If you are anywhere near Durango & Spring Mountain (or even if you are not) you have to try it out! The Crepe Suzette with orange jam and gran mariner was the daily special, our Lulu was vanilla chestnut jam, and the savory Matt had mushrooms, chicken, and cheese with a small side salad (and delicious dressing too). It was all incredibly good. The great meal combined with the warm atmosphere created by Maggie (who is there and super friendly) makes this a must for everyone's list of places to visit. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Enough with the chains and franchises. This place is good. 160 reviews and 5 stars certainly supports that. I hope it stay's profitable because society needs more diverse places like this. It's important for the sanity of culture. But the location is setback from Durango a good amount and exterior's mirrored storefront isn't doing any favors for them. This explains why it wasn't busy. I wouldn't have noticed it driving by. If I were them and could afford it, I'd relocate to a location with a lot smaller setbacks. Found it on Yelp. Food, Service and interior are all solid. Comfortable. Owners are friendly. Price is reasonable considering the skill in crepe making. Will go back. I encourage others to try it as well."}
{"text":"Galettes were bland with little flavor besides cheese.  The server dropped a plate of food all over my purse and did not even apologize.  We were interested in trying some crepes, but I am not sure if we will go back or not."}
{"text":"This is how my food delivery order arrived to me. I am so disappointed. My coffee was like somebody just took a sip on it. Not worth it for $35 food delivery. 06/17/2017 worst food delivery i ever encountered in my life!"}
{"text":"De passage sur Las Vegas je pensais manger une bonne galette comme chez nous pour me rappeler le pays... déçue déçue..... La galette était aussi froide que la Propriétaire!!"}
{"text":"I decided to go out for breakfast after the gym and had this place bookmarked for some time.  I sat at the counter after reading the galettes and crêpes descriptions on the large menu boards.  I ordered the galette of the month and a black coffee.  The coffee was brought quickly in a glass that kept the coffee very hot for a long time.  I watched as the young woman made some crêpes that were being taken out and two galettes for other customers eating in house.  And, I had the fun of watching her make my galette.  The galette, made with buckwheat batter, was quite good.  The cheese and tomatoes had a lot of flavor but the honey was very light in adding anything to the dish.  While waiting, I chatted with Madame Maggie and I looked at her homemade jams for sale on the counter.  I need to go back and try a sweet crêpe.  The Nutella seems to be calling me.  It's good to have a crêperie like this not too far from home."}
{"text":"I truly don't have to say much about this place.   Cute little place that you can tell the owner actually have passion about what they do.  I can tell by fancy hand wash soap and William-Sonoma hand lotion that provided in the bathroom! Most of the time when I have my guest at my home....They didn't even have that luxury!!!! LOL  Everything was delicious, clean and lovely.  If you like crepes absolutely must try. They use homemade whipped cream with their crepes and no sugar added but honey!   I definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes place. It is really french authentic. I tried the sophie and the domi and it was delicious. Maggie is the owner and is very passionate and very nice. If you like crepes, it is definitly a place to go and try."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Very authentic French creperie. We had the savory galettes followed by desert crepes.  Ingredients are and staff are the real deal!"}
{"text":"I came here after work for a quick dinner on 5/6/16. It's such a cute little place!   I had the Marion galette ($9) with mozzarella, tomato, and pesto and it was delicious and made with high quality ingredients. The best thing for me is that their galettes are made with buckwheat flour which is gluten free. I was recently diagnosed with a pretty bad gluten intolerance so this makes me so happy. My friend had the Tom crepe ($8) and she said it was also delicious. All sweet crepes are not gluten free and made with wheat flour and I definitely wish I could have tried one! I believed we were being served by the owner judging by the crepe-inspired license plate on the car parked directly in front of the restaurant :) She was very friendly and sweet.  We really enjoyed our quick bite here. Unfortunately it's in a strip mall notorious for shops going out of business so I hope they can maintain a steady customer base. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Decided to come in on a bright Tuesday morning to try this new restaurant out. We had the pleasure of enjoying the Nancy, the Alex, and the Lauren off of the menu and it was truly fantastic. The flavors were all there and the portions were just right. The service was also exemplary as the owners came to each table to ensure that all was well with each individual guest. I hope this restaurant finds true success in the near future. Check this place out! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I always consider crepe for desert and never been a big fan of crepe for main course. Heard a lot about \"La maison de Maggie \" So I figured I will give it a try. When I walked in , I was very impressed by the place. Crêperies in France are usually very small places with a Britanny farm decor but this restaurant have been design with simple and good taste.The menu on a chalk board  look attractive with wide variety of crepes Salty an Sugary. I was happy to see the place offering some fresh smoothies. I let the owner know I was on a plant base diet and let her decide what I should eat. My lunch was made \"a la minute\" and all ingredients were fresh. The positive attitude, great service, excellent fresh food and constant smile from Maggie made a huge difference on my entire experience. Today I changed my vision of \"Crêperies\" and I will definitely go back. Thank you Maggie !"}
{"text":"Simply the best crepes in Vegas! Very French ambiance. Loved the crepes and smoothies. Cool place for lunch."}
{"text":"Delightful spot for weekend breakfast! We had the France and Sophie galettes and they were fabulous- the staff were very sweet and helpful and let us try some of their homemade jams (the peach mint and the persimmon were amazing). If you're looking for authentic French crepes and galettes this is your place! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Came back this week, and it was still healthy and delicious!  It is must go to for my Vegas trips, either for work or pleasure.  Check it out - it is worth whatever drive you make."}
{"text":"My bf and I just love looking for cozy French cafes. La Maison de Maggie exemplifies that welcoming feeling right when you walk in. The owner Maggie and her staff were very personable and made you feel at home. She even gave us a background of the names she chose for her menu which I thought was pretty cool. The interior is industrial chic which I love!  My bf and I ordered the Marion which is a savory crepe that has pesto, tomatoes, and cheese, and another savory crepe that has ham, blue cheese, and spinach. Both very delicious and you can just taste the quality of the crepes. I also recommend their smoothies and lattes!! :) will go back again!"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment.  Cubed processed chicken (Hormel?) in your galettes?  REALLY???  I am led to believe this is a fast food crepe restaurant by the quality, but the prices say otherwise.  Wishing you would establish more food pride (like Cafe Du Lac) for a second try."}
{"text":"I finally tried what some publications and people have called the best crepes in Las Vegas. I can't quite concur with that high praise though.  La Maison de Maggie is a little shop not far from Desert Breeze Park that offers crepes, galettes (savory buckwheat crepes), smoothies, and drinks both non-alcoholic and otherwise. They're in the back of a plaza containing an Arby's and are sandwiched between some driving school and the ironically liquor license-less breakfast/lunch spot Mimosas.  We were greeted promptly upon entry and nudged to order at the register before sitting, which is pretty much standard at these places. Glad I was able to save on the bill because the offerings here are pricey. Nevertheless, we ordered, found a table, then received our order relatively quickly. It was after when any typical weekday lunch rush would happen, so hopefully this wasn't a bad sign for them.  France ($11): galette with egg (chose sunny side up rather than scrambled), ham, and cheese. I enjoyed the galette itself, the runny yolk, and the ham and cheese. It felt like I got a little more cheese in a thicker form in this galette than at my favorite galette, but I didn't quite enjoy the flavors of the ham and cheese as much here. Plus, this galette is significantly more expensive.  Tom ($8): crepe with Nutella, banana, whipped cream. Loved the chewiness of the crepe and the Nutella, and banana had the right ripeness/sweetness. The whipped cream was good, but it wasn't magical as I've had at some places. The price is the same as my local favorite crepe, but the flavors were merely delicious and not heavenly.  Iced coffee ($2.50): strong coffee flavor, not too bitter, doesn't have that \"grassy\" tone that I've experienced and disliked from Stumptown and other roasters. It's the one area that's superior to the offerings at my favorite crepe spot.  I would love to give 4.5 stars to La Maison de Maggie, but considering the limitations of Yelp's rating system and my unwillingness to place this on the same level as my favorite crepe place (let's just say they're named for the Brittany region of France), I'll have to round down to 4. The crepe and galette menu does have more variety here, so hopefully I can try some of the less familiar offerings if and when I get a little bored of the other creperie. However, both are pretty far from my Henderson home, so I don't foresee that happening very often."}
{"text":"Mon expérience n'était pas aussi bonne que prévu. J'ai commandé le Marion, une pâtisserie et un chocolat chaud. Le monsieur du café semblait plus préoccupé de faire des boissons pour son ami qui était en ligne derrière moi et oublié ma boisson et ma galette. Je devais rappeler à l'homme. Il a dit qu'il avait oublié ma commande. J'ai fini par attendre 20 minutes. C'était délicieux, mais le café semblait un peu désorganisé et pas très amical."}
{"text":"Maggie and her team always do a perfect job, the crepes have the closest flavors to the one I tried in France. It's always a great experience !!!  I had a Grenadine iced tea. Only French people know what Grenadine is.  Ate a Marion with chicken and Feta cheese."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes & homemade jams!  The pear mint jam is to die for and I don't usually like jams, but couldn't wait to dab each bite!! We had the Lucy, Lauren, Alli and France!  All were great, the Lauren was probably our favorite!  Met Maggie and she is super sweet and truly wants you to enjoy your food and experience. Love supporting local businesses and this one is a true hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and the adorable woman who owns it. She is so friendly and joyful! I love the France and Alex with buckwheat flour (since I'm allergic to wheat flour). Each table has a power outlet as well. So convenient! And the atmosphere is French chic. Will be coming back frequently (:"}
{"text":"This place would give Crepe Expectations a run for their money due to an amazing decor, great customer service and less of a line to get delicious crepes. This place is amazingly simple in its setup and owns all the basic fundamentals for a crepe & coffee shop. The owner is extremely sweet and humble which gets them the 4 stars from this guy!"}
{"text":"This is a quality crepe at a fair price.  I had the Nancy Crepe for lunch, and it was very satisfying. My wife had a Nutella desert crepe.   I felt my crepe was a good lunch. My wife felt they could have been more generous with the Nutella.  I would suggest this place for breakfast or lunch. Since they close at 7, I would pass on dinner here.   Nice ladies, and they do provide a quality product."}
{"text":"Wow!! So happy I was able to try this place before going back home. We need one of these in California. The staff is not only friendly and knowledgeable but the food is great!"}
{"text":"Five stars total for their food, drinks, service and cleanness of the place.  The crepes seems to be authentic French.  Definitely thinner, healthier and prettier than those Americanized creamy fat crepes that many other restaurants serve. The owner takes care of this place really well.  We chatted with her a bit when she came to check on us, and she told us her that friends always said to her how come she kept cleaning and wiping the place all the time.  Tables, the way they put all the chairs, and of course both bathrooms, everything was kept organized and clean.  Although this place isn't that big, their layout is spacious for all customers and the high ceiling is adding extra to the comfortable feeling. We are certainly coming back during our stay in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First time diner- wow is this place authentic.  Had a nice brunch there today, a savory and a sweet crepe, with cider.    Ingredients: impeccable.  Presentation: professional.  I don't speak French, but the customers were conversing quite easily at tables, and the warm welcomes from friends was evident.    Savory: Wheat crepe, with ham, spinach and bleu cheese.  Sweet: Egg, nutella, banana, whip cream.    Visit when you want some home cooking, some friendliness, and taste the hard work put into her business."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. The sign outside is a bit small and hard to catch, but I'm glad I did. The overall mood of the entire place was extremely pleasant and the family was very sweet. I ordered the Tom sweet crepe and a hazelnut latte! Both were wonderful and beautifully made. Overall wonderful place to go to."}
{"text":"Authentic French crêpes! What more could you ask for?!?  My family and I went to France last winter and Maggie's is spot on. We are truly blessed to have some authentic cuisine in Las Vegas.  I had the savoury \"Polo\" (ham, spinach and bleu cheese) my wife had the \"France\" (egg, ham, cheese). We shared a \"Domi\" (caramel, vanilla ice cream, walnuts).  The crêpes are made from buckwheat flour and were thin, light and flavorful. Our savoury crêpes came with a salad as well!"}
{"text":"In Vegas for business/pleasure. My husband and I love supporting local business and we found a true gem. Wonderful crepes and the Mocha with hazelnut was amazing! The owner is from France and has made this restaurant very authentic. She is very sweet just like her crepes! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others visiting Vegas. It's not on the strip but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Bonjour, Here is my quick review of La Maison de Maggie and the phenomenal meal I had. My girlfriend and I got the Marion galette and the Matt galette and were to say the least, astonished. The lattes we both ordered were made to perfection and are exactly what a latte should be! There is no need to fear getting a poorly made coffee here like other places. Maggie has standards and most importantly CONSISTENCY! Great service too which is obviously key to a great experience.  Also, the mimosas we ordered were delicious because of the fact that Maggie uses REAL champagne in them and not sparkling wine. Also, the coffee is Lavazza brand! Honestly, you have to try La Maison to Maggie if you're in the mood for a great quality meal. As a French man, I know French quality food, and this is truly French quality food!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't so crazy for crêpes? This is the perfect crêpe brunch spot and you are going to be instantly charmed by the cute little details of the place, including the decorative naming of the crêpes and the specialities written out on the chalkboard. The various compositions of different crêpes on the menu all sound pretty great that I had trouble choosing what I wanted first, but eventually I opted for the Marion crêpe (tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and pesto) and one sweet crêpe, the Domi. They were both delicious, sweet, satisfying! The crêpes can take just a little while to make, but they are well worth it. Ingredients are simple and fresh. Usually, there are no more than three or four ingredients per crêpe. Everything was seasoned lightly and allowed for the natural flavors of the ingredients to come out.  I would have liked perhaps a more traditional French dressing on my salad otherwise everything was very good. The smoothies are to die for and I would highly recommend the Domi crêpe, which had the perfect amount of salted caramel (not too sweet) and chopped nuts with vanilla ice-cream.  As the Editor-in-chief of French Quarter Magazine, I looked for a good French café in Las Vegas where I could take my guests and Maggie, the owner, welcomed us as we entered her restaurant. She shows her love for her heritage by the South of France inspired decoration, to her quotes written in French on the walls, the clocks on the wall showing the time difference between the U.S. and France, and of course crêpes! When you get here, you get exactly what you look for: minimalistic design, simple ingredients, and great service. For a moment, I almost felt like I was back in France with the talk radio playing in the background.   I was really tempted to get a third crêpe, but I'll have to wait another day. Viva les crêpes!"}
{"text":"A solid 5 stars - great atmosphere, amazing crepes and galettes (we love the Marion), stellar service!"}
{"text":"Maggie is a beautiful soul, felt so welcomed from the moment I walked in. The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. The crepes are delicious and authentic with a tasty selection! Keep it on your foodie list!  Mercie Maggie~"}
{"text":"What a cute little spot! Very authentic. They speak predominantly French, but its no bother to me. The only downside is the location. They serve food but it is selective. I am a crepe fanatic and also very picky about how they taste, however this was very good. They have 22 different types . I had the Tom, which consist of Nutella, Banana, and whip cream. I also had ice cream which was absolutely tasty ."}
{"text":"Im glad to finally find an authentic french creperia. Apparently they even bring their flour from France. Their prices are reasonable and the customer service is very good. I ordered a sweet and salty crepe. My favorite were the sweet options. I tried the Nutella and bananas as well as the pear and cinnamon. They were both great. Their sweet fruit glazed was very tasty. For my savory option I had the chicken with mushroom and mozzarella cheese. I liked the texture of the crepe and the flavor of the mushroom. However, I wish the crepe would have include some type of sauce on top as it lacked a bit of flavor. Overall, a nice little cafe if you are craving some authentic French crepes!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a pleasant surprise!  The food and the atmosphere were great.  Very French.  The Crepes were excellent.  The food was fresh and delicious.  I love the inside.  I never would have expected this from a strip mall!  There are other French restaurants in Vegas but this is amazing.  If you need a light lunch, and like crepes- come here."}
{"text":"Awesome food! The owner was very nice go try out the crepes it's amazing !!!! Mm mm mm"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  The tom crepe was delicious and so was the galette with ham!  Nothing fancy but great food!"}
{"text":"A much welcomed change for breakfast, off-Strip!   After eating at a place like La Maison de Maggie, I'm not sure why breakfast-chains continue to be popular.  It was located in a nondescript, relatively new plaza with plenty of parking.  Unit itself is calm, slightly dim, and away from the hustle and bustle.    We had a galette (savoury buckwheat crepe) each and they came with a side salad.  I believe it was the owner, Maggie who greeted us, made the crepes, and did the serving.  Crepes were delicious, light, but satisfying for breakfast.  The only reason why my review fell short of 5*s is because the coffee wasn't great.  Having said that, I never really had a good coffee during my stay in Vegas.  I'd definitely come back when I'm in town next!"}
{"text":"I wanted to have breakfast alone after church & decided to come to this place. It has 5 stars so I thought what the hey. I was greeted when I walked in & the place was pretty quiet. You order at the counter & seat yourself. The menu is on a chalkboard behind the register. They serve smoothies, galettes, crepes, and coffee! I wanted to be healthy so I went with the Nancy, which came with egg whites, turkey, and spinach. I've never had a galette before so I didn't really know what to expect. I also ordered a latte.  I sat at the bar since all the tables were huge & preferably for bigger parties. The owner didn't think I was 21 so she asked me if I was since they can't have anybody underage at the bar (even though they didn't have any alcohol out). The latte came out first & it was good! It didn't have any sweetener added to it, which is how I like my coffee. The galette came soon after and I enjoyed it very much. I probably should have added a little bit of cheese or something.   The owner came and talked to me while I was eating. She asked how I found out about the place & also shared her thoughts about Yelp. Shes a very sweet and honest business owner. I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu, especially the crepes!"}
{"text":"We arrived on a Thursday at around 10AM to find the restaurant empty sans Maggie and an assistant.  The posted menu was reviewed and decisions were reached.  My wife chose the Tom crepe - Nutella, bananas and whipped cream.  Lauren attracted by eye - Nutella, strawberries and whipped cream. Are we talking healthy breakfast or what?  Though on the pricey side for a local creperie, we thought the quality was  very good and much cheaper than ones in Aria and Bellagio.  Maggie also allowed us to sample 4 unique house made jams that were very good."}
{"text":"Its very good place and Nice crêpe,  i like that, il I'm recommand all the crêpe,  see you again fast"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is French and he drags me to every French restaurant in town.  We come here quite often! Authentic french crepes made by a warm and friendly French woman in a quaint cafe that transports you to France. Maggie is always so welcoming and treats us like family. What more could we ask for?  I usually get a savory crepe, which is made with buckwheat flour, and he usually gets a sweet one that I always steal a bite of :)"}
{"text":"AHidden gem behind Arby's on Durango by the  park. If you're cravings awesome crepes...this is the place to get me.   The place is very cute inside....the outside is deceiving when u drive up.   The crepes are huge...and so many ingredients to choose from...and yes they have me with Nutella too =) We shared a smoothie together but really should've gotten too cause it was delicious (the will)  we kept fighting over it...ha Salad was fresh and good portion size... Will definitely be back to have breakfast crepes ...service friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Not fast.  Polite people.  Drab decor.  In a strip mall.  Too far from strip.  Too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Delightful cafe great for families or singles to feel out of this world.  A little Paris in Las Vegas.  Took the kids for something different kind of breakfast.  We each got our own savory breakfast crepes.  The crepe was thin and light and serving was big enough that we didn't finish what's on our plate.  What we love about their....  Savory Crepes - not greasy breakfast Dessert crepes - light sweet and delicious.  Not overly sweet like candy Beverages - coffee, latte, and hot chocolate were on par Service - Maggie was delightful and friendly.  She had family visiting out of town who donned Santa hats and aprons to help serve us.  Such nice people! Decor - we sent the kids around the room to learn the French writing around via translation apps.  Great mini game to keep them occupied and learn something profound   We wish you success Maggie.  Thank you for putting so much thought into creating a cute cafe and bringing a different experience to Las Vegas.  You truly light up the venue."}
{"text":"New to Vegas and in search of good food.  Been here twice now for breakfast and love the \"France\" and latte is top notch.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Such a great find! I'm visiting from Seattle and was in need of a great cup of coffee (Starbucks sucks) and found out that they also made crepes. I got the Marion, a buckwheat flower crepe with pesto, mozzarella & tomatoes. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on yelp and went because of the reviews, and we were not disappointed! Everything about this restaurant from it's fresh, clean, deliciously prepared food, to its owner and chef is truly remarkable! There is nothing like it for breakfast anywhere, and is certainly some of the best French food we have ever enjoyed! When we visited the owner had only had the restaurant open 18 months but she is truly doing an outstanding job and I hope people will support her and keep her in business and make her successful. If I lived in town I would probably have breakfast here at least once a week, and would really look forward to trying some of her lunches and dinners at another time. This is truly an authentic European French café and everything about it was exquisite and so different from anything typical American, it was very refreshing."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! After living in France for years, I can assure you that this is the real deal. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place and the owner.  Absolutely the best crepes in Vegas and in my opinion the best I have had in the US.  Do yourself a favor and visit this place soon."}
{"text":"Spectacular savory & sweet crepes! This is the first good creperie we've found in our 8 years in Vegas. My husband is French. Having lived in Brittany during university, he is tremendously particular & easily disappointed with crepes. Maggie offers traditional as well as innovative crepes with fresh, high quality organic ingredients. She even imports her flour from France. The atmosphere is warm & welcoming (and there is wifi). So happy we stumbled upon this gem. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This spot is wonderful and unique. It feels like you're stepping into a bakery or cafe in Paris or Avignon. The buckwheat gallettes are very tasty- we've had some of the specials and the regular ones. Ingredients are fresh and the combinations are interesting and creative. Each gallette comes with a green salad with mustard vinaigrette and is a nice foil. The sweet dessert crepes are yummy as well. Our son had a smoothie and it was a good. I love the authentic latte (or cafe creme) so it's what I always get. Maggie is a sweetheart which is a bonus. A++ will go back often."}
{"text":"Probably the best crepes I've had in my life, and I say this as someone who's lived in Europe for 2 years, and had them in Paris, Normandy, and Provence. If you have a hankering for a light delicious and filling breakfast or afternoon snack stop by."}
{"text":"Yummy French crepes!! They were delicious and Maggie accommodated our large group graciously."}
{"text":"An authentic crepe restaurant.  Absolutely delicious food. It's like the South of France on Spring Mt and Durango."}
{"text":"Very Good. I need to relearn French. I'm going to spend time in France, then come back here to order and speak to the staff in French. Try this place once and you will return for more,"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes and jam; the best we have had so far! This hidden gem is hidden away in a quiet shopping center so make sure you stop by!"}
{"text":"We just happened onto La Maison de Maggie... we were just driving along...and super hungry (kinda hangry) + saw a sign on the main street for \"French Crepes\". Really? Here? We actually didn't believe it....but we do now! The food is fantastic + the atmosphere is comfortable, but sylish. Maggie, the owner, is nice as can be.; she makes brilliant food. BTW, my husband ordered a \"France\" and I asked for the same --- but with a little substitution to make it vegetarian. And, again much to my surprise, they accommodated! I guess that was about the only non-French thing about the place --- that they're accommodating, that is. Try this place. You won't be disappointed. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a special little spot.  First off,  seating is either at the bar or at a long table,  family style seating.  No cozy date booth, but it's fun to enjoy the company of other people enjoying the same thing as you.  It's a small place so sometimes there's a wait for seating.   There are two options for crepes,  1 savory menu and the other sweet.   The savory is naturally gluten free.  The sweet you must request the gluten free batter and let them know if you've a severe reaction and they can heat up the spare grill for you.   Savory crepes come with a small salad tossed with their homemade dressing.  I wish they would sell it,  it's so very good and simple.   These are authentic crepes done in  the French style.  They're rather large.  Two of us usually order 1 of each savory and sweet then share them.  They serve some alcoholic drinks,  have coffee served in french fashion.  No sweet starbucks concoctions here.  Just good ,strong correct coffee.   The owner is super friendly and nice to chat with if the place is slow when you go in.  It's definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Excellent! We had the Tom (Nutella and banana) and the Matt (mushroom, chicken and cheese). Also cappuccinos. Very good food. I could eat three of these. They are so good. Short easy drive from the Vegas strip with easy parking. Shopping area around too.  The place is very clean, neat and nice atmosphere. Has a coffee shop atmosphere.  Service was very friendly too!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  Both of my daughters had the nutella and strawberry crepes and I ordered the egg and ham and cheese.  We loved them all.  If the restaurant was closer to my home,  I would go broke eating there.   The owner is kind and so welcoming.  It's definitely a must,  if you're in the area.  It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and owner super sweet !! We ordered the Matt , Louren and mikca smoothie(which the kids loved !) definitely recommend and will be coming again !"}
{"text":"La Maison de Maggie is truly one of a kind and its a must add on to anyone's foodie list!!!  The best traditional crepes you'll find in Las Vegas!!!  I came here during the start of the Christmas season, the ambiance here is so beautiful with Christmas decorations, listening to Jingle Bells in French definitely raised festive levels.    The Galette (savory crepes) & regular sweet Crêpes involve authentic French buckwheat and wheat flour which are imported from France. Crepe tends to feel light on the stomach and unlocks the natural flavor from the fresh ingredients to come alive. They don't add lots of ingredients to the crepes, quite frankly it doesn't need more stuff, sometimes keeping it simple is the best. I actually had room enough to eat two crepes, in France that's very common.    Maggie (owner) is very kind, friendly person and she's passionate about the products she makes. She loves her culture and wants to deliver on that taste of France experience all the time.   These are my favorites so far, I have to go back try some more. The Marion - mozzarella cheese, tomato, pesto.  The Alli - Cinnamon and powdered sugar."}
{"text":"Oh my God I love this place so much !!!my friend recommended this place and he told me it's the best crepes in the area and he was right I definitely recommend to everybody who loves French food"}
{"text":"This place is great and authentic.  Maggie just opened this recently and is such a nice person.  Had a savory crepe that was great. Maggie then brought out a complimentary sweet crepe that was great as well."}
{"text":"From someone who spent a lot of time in France take it from me, this place is authentic. Everything is hand made and fresh. I came back the next day with a group of 5!"}
{"text":"What a great location... Greeted by Maggie and helped by Celine(sp). The service was except and very customer oriented. My party had several different crepes and each were magnificent. I can appreciate the cleanliness and great service.  This is s small business that understands how to be great to customers and we need to support this business!"}
{"text":"our new favorite crepe place - highly recommend the Marion galette and Alex crepe - cant wait to come back and try the Crepe Suzette which they flambé table side"}
{"text":"Awesome little spot. Maggie is wonderful, takes your order, cooks your food, and serves you. And she has treats that remind you of France to purchase in her retail area...what a gem!!"}
{"text":"I've had amazing crepes in the South of France, and was kind of hoping for a similar experience. The customer service was 5-stars alone, but the crepes were average at best. The turkey, egg white and spinach was void of any flavor. My husband experienced the same with his chicken, spinach and mushroom crepe. The sweet crepes were better, but who can mess up a Nutella or berry crepe? I really wanted to like this place more, since it's been on my must-try list forever."}
{"text":"This place is so adorable! My boyfriend & I have been wanting to go here and we finally did for Date Night. This is a cute French spot that has Savory & Sweet Crêpes. We ordered the 'Matt' for our Savory dish which has mushrooms,chicken, and cheese on buckwheat crêpes and added L spinach and the 'Lauren' for our sweet tooth: strawberries, Nutella and whip cream. They were both delicious! We had a conversation with Maggie at the end. Ms.Maggie is a sweet lady. We wrote in the Golden Book. This is definitely an authentic spot. I love that it close by and we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little place we came across by chance on our travels. I am from New Zealand and my partner is French. I have also spent some time in France, so we both know a good crepe when we eat one.   Safe to say this place met our expectations, the owner is a lovely woman and her cooking skills are superb. One of the nicest meals I have had in the US since being here.  Would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys good food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Had lunch with the family and ordered a delicious galette (similar to a crepe) with cheese, and ham. Wonderful mixture of tastes. Also had a salad - you get to pick what you want - also delicious. The ingredients are fresh and savory and made for a great lunch. Try their homemade jams ... creative mixtures (strawberry basil and others).  I have eaten here half a dozen or more times and it is always delicious."}
{"text":"Nice place and wasn't too busy at 11:30 on a Saturday. We came here because the Baby Stacks place was on a 20 min wait and packed out, it was chaos over there.   We had a few Gallete Crepes and shared a dessert Crepe. We got the France, the Matt and the Tom.  Tasted just like the crepes we had in Paris!"}
{"text":"I went to La Maison de Maggie for the first time today and I want to go back as soon as possible. I got a crepe, smoothie, and tea. Everything I ordered was made fresh, extremely delicious, and served quickly. The savory crepe had pesto, tomatoes, and mozzarella was so wonderful. It was made to perfection.  The staff was extremely welcoming and actually from France so that is definitely an added bonus!   I highly recommend coming to get a crepe or two! It is a great place and extremely welcoming :)"}
{"text":"The best in town...very friendly service feels like home..."}
{"text":"This review is for a visit a few weeks ago. First off, I have spent time in France, so I know what a good crêpe should taste like.  Everywhere I go people make them either too thick, too thin, too crisp or too soft. Here, she makes perfect crêpes. The texture is perfect, the size is just right, and the ingredients are scrumptious and mouth watering. Whether you choose a sweet or savory crêpe, you will not be disappointed. I had a breakfast crêpe which kept my taste buds happy for the rest of the day. It was awesome! I will be coming back again and again as this is now my new favorite crêpe place."}
{"text":"Quiet little place with good crepes, Lavazza coffee, fresh smoothies and free wifi. Would definitely come back here! Stepping in feels makes you feel like you've stepped out of Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here. It's was delicious! All of it! Make sure to try Maggie's home made jams; believe me you will be taking some home. Gluten free all organic."}
{"text":"This place is truly authentic! The owner comes straight from France and imports most of her things from France or makes it from scratch! She works solo so be patient if it gets a little busy but this place is absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant by chance - tucked away in a strip mall off Durango. So happy I stopped in. They offer crepes, both savory & sweet, so it's perfect for breakfast or lunch (they close at 4:00). After having to make a tough choice I had the \"Galette Polo\" & a glass of white and loved my lunch. Fresh ingredients made to order - very flavorful!!! The restaurant is quaint, service is prompt, friendly and attentive. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch today.   France Gallette very yummy and such a welcoming owner!  We chatted for a while and,  after I mentioned that I love chocolate but dislike nutella (which is what they have), she surprised me with a treat free of charge!  She had made chocolate crepes for a special event that morning and had leftover batter  - so she cooked one up with butter and sugar and it was awesome!  This is a true hidden gem and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Sophie\" crepe and a cappuccino. Absolutely delicious! Service was friendly and accommodating. I definitely encourage to try this place out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The search for the perfect crepes in LV is over.  La Maison de Maggie is the best. Wife and I had the LouLou with strawberries. Vanilla chestnut jam was delicious."}
{"text":"Maggie's place is simply delightful! The crepes are delicious and the smoothies and jams - so inventive! The ambiance is as warm as you can't imagine a strip mall location can be. And Maggie herself is very friendly, talented, and modest!"}
{"text":"Straight Outta France La Maison de Maggie is owned and operated by Chef Maggie Reb, who's cooking up authentic French cuisine at her restaurant on Durango.  Offering up crepes and galettes, I've visited twice in an attempt to widen my French food horizons.  Upon entering the café on my most recent visit, the sweet smell of strawberry basil jam being cooked on the stove greeted my gal pal and I.  Chef Maggie was making a new batch to sell and I'm sure it went quickly.  I had my first galette, the July special, with mozzarella, tomato, goat cheese, and honey.  You can sit at the counter and watch your food being made in front of you.  Using authentic buckwheat and wheat flour imported from France for her crepes and galettes, Chef whipped up our orders in no time.   My galette was delicious, especially with the pairing of the cheese with the honey.  Chef Maggie also let us sample the freshly made strawberry basil jam: ooh la la!  This is food made with love from a real French chef.  Stop by to try something new for your palate:  bon appetit!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal!  Maggie is great, the food is delicious, and the prices are reasonable with great portion size.  This was my wife and my first time here but we're looking forward to coming again and again to try the rest of the menu!   I got the Matt with a Micka to drink. My wife got the Marion with a Cheryl to drink.   Next time we'll order a sweet and a savory crepe to share more!"}
{"text":"A perfect place to have a morning chit chat with my loved one while having breakfast. Crepes taste amazing and we can't compare to crepes that are made in other restaurants. It's just exceptionally good!!! I did not like the chestnut jam that came with my crepe (ordered out of curiosity). It was a bit too sweet for my taste but I know what to order next time.   I love how much whipping cream they added on the dish (a lot!). I wish they had mangoes for toppings since I'm going nut for it when it comes to crepes. Customer service was great too.  J'ADORE!"}
{"text":"The place was friendly and clean. The food was good but a little pricey. We had two crepes and one smoothie for around $26. We left hungry. Maybe good for people that don't eat that much."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing and delicious. Call ahead to bring home a meal or dessert if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"This was likely my favorite breakfast I've ever had. Found by the yelp reviews and so glad I did. Located in a wierd strip mall but should be in a high end center or casino. Chef Maggie is an artist. The crepes are out of this world and so creative. I had to leave half of my breakfast crepe just because I could not leave without trying one of her dessert crepes. I had the Alex dessert with pears and caramel. It melted in my mouth. I was visiting from out of state but my next visit to Vegas I know exactly where I am heading for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent crepes. We had the Paris (savory) and the Alex (sweet). The staff was great and truly cared about our experience."}
{"text":"The caramel crepe is the best. I love it so much I haven't been able to try anything else."}
{"text":"Very cute place, service was great, crepes were absolutely amazing. Both my friend and I enjoyed eating here for her birthday brunch :)"}
{"text":"I haven't yet tried the galettes, but I would like to do so; I was disappointed with the sweet crepes selection, which have only one fruit each and seem to emphasize more sugary aspects (whipped cream, nutella, etc.). I had a smoothie, which had a decent flavor balance, but I wish the flax seeds were ground into powder."}
{"text":"This place has the best crepes I've ever had. The owner is super nice, I love the decor and ambiance. We will be back again."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The crepes were authentic and delicious :) My friend and i got both savory and sweet crepes. As soon as they arrived you could smell their fragrance. And the whipped creme is made fresh! I'm kind of lactose intolerant and couldn't resist haha. And the owner is so sweet. What a great surprise find, definitely would come back."}
{"text":"The best authentic French crepe in Las Vegas! I am addict to the Marion (mozzarella cheese, tomato, basil pesto). The environment is warm, the owner Maggie is very nice. Lots of parking space in front of the crepery. The quality of Lavazza coffee is  perfect with the choice of Cappuccino, Latte, Mocha..... Price are very reasonable for this high quality French cooking."}
{"text":"What a cozy little joint very romantic & The owner was pleasure with her sexy French accent. I'm enjoying the flying baby And I added spinach to it with the extra dressing that she made for the salad. Extremely delicious with loads of flavor."}
{"text":"Très bel endroit, accueil chaleureux, service rapide et surtout un très bon repas. Je recommande"}
{"text":"As a French native I am always quite scared of Crepes places but wow I am so happy I found La Maison de Maggie ! The crepes are to die for , the service is great , very sweet and welcoming . I highly recommend it ! The savory crepes are so light and tasty with the real Sarrasin flour from France and the sweet ones are heaven so light and delicious .

{"text":"Excellent Crepes!  My wife and I went to La  Maison  de Maggie for a late breakfast today.  We tried a sweet crepe with nutella & strawberries and a savory crepe with ham, egg, & cheese (the France crepe).  AWESOME!!!!  The owner & her staff are also very friendly.  We definitely reccomend this spot."}
{"text":"YAAAAAASSSSSSSSS!!! So happy to have come across this little gold mine of deliciousness. I ordered one of the savory crepes (galette), but can't wait to come back for a sweet one.   Great service, Maggie was friendly and hospitable. Super cute inside and she'll be serving French wines soon! Uber excited.   Great local business to support!"}
