{"text":"We found Dolce Vino by accident about 6 months ago and have been back a number of times since then. The food is excellent with the exception of the chicken cacciatore on one visit that had shredded chicken and over cooked vegetables. Not like any other I have ever eaten and I just won't order it again. There are plenty of other offerings that are exceptional. That one experience does not take away from our overall opinion of the restaurant. It is a small place and the live music on Fridays and Saturdays is a bit much. Very hard to have a decent conversation with others at the table. In spite of this, Dolce has become one of our favorites. It is not the easiest place to find and on a sketchy part of Glendale Ave. but well worth the trip."}
{"text":"We have a new favorite Italian restaurant.  The food was fabulous. It reminded me of my time living in Italy. We will celebrate other special days here. Like those ending in \"Y\""}
{"text":"My honey and I have dined at Dolce Vino three or four times since they opened. We have, on all occasions, been pleasantly served lovely dishes that have been prepared with love and care by Ernesto and assistant. The mussels are served in a yummy sauce that you will order more bread to sop up every last drop! The sauces are all very appetizing whether it's the red or white. Quality food at a comparable price point. The wine selection is very nice as well, thank you Mr. Tim :-) Give this restaurant a visit, you will be back!"}
{"text":"Just ate here with the family, great authentic vibe. The owner is Italian, speaks Italian and brings the real deal to the table! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here this evening and is was great!  The owner is very attentive and the food was fantastic!  My husband had the cioppino and it was the best he has ever had (and he has had a lot of cioppino).  The atmosphere is a lounge.  There is a piano player with singer from 6-9.  They were great.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Tonight was my 3rd time in 5 days I've eaten at Dolce Vino.  First time I popped in by myself, I got the Eggplant Rollantini, it surpassed what exactly what I was craving after a long day at work.  Chef Ernesto & Sommelier Tim were incredibly welcoming and happy to assist me in my choices.  Tim recommended a fantastic New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc that perfectly complimented my Rollantini.  For being open only 2 weeks, the food flowed effortlessly from the kitchen, the music and ambiance was a treat for my tired self.  The 2nd time, I ordered to-go for a friend that flew into town who I knows loves Eggplant Parmigiano, I called ahead on a Sat night, Tim took my order and they were spot on for when  it was ready.  The place was full and piano was groovin, I know this place is going to be incredibly popular quickly when word gets out!  Tonight I took my honey and a friend from CA, we had Cioppino, Lobster Ravioli and Lobster with seafood Risotto.  Tim recommended a fabulous bottle of Chianti that was a perfect pairing.  Each of us after the first bite knew we were enjoying something special.  Here it is, over an hour later and each of us are still raving at how wonderful our meal was tonight.  Dolce Vino is more than a welcome addition to our neighborhood, I expect them to be reservations only when word gets out how phenomenal they are in Glendale.  I look forward to many more meals and bringing my friends and loved ones to Dolce Vino!"}
{"text":"Love this place   My wine group went here tonight for the first time and it was absolutely perfect. The food was delish and the live jazz was on point. The owner was so attentive and generous. I would recommend this as a date night!"}
{"text":"At Dolce Vino Wine Bar Italian Cuisine has the best wine I have tasted!! The food is more than extravagant! I adore taking my wife here on our anniversary!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm a new York transplant and this ace is on the mark. I have passed it a couple times and decided to try it. The wine great the mussels are rediculis and for get about the sauce on the smoked mozzarella ravioli it's just perfect. They had a good staff and the piano player was good. This will be reservation only place very soon."}
{"text":"We had a great Birthday dinner for my husband and friends.  This was our first time there and the reviews on Yelp helped me select ithis restaurant.  Ernesto the owner made the evening special and the food was excellent for all 4 of us and we will be back again for sure.  What a great find for the future and I will recommend this place to all our friends."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal at this establishment this evening. Enjoyed the Caprese salad and a plate of mussels.  Many wine choices to pair with their cuisine.  I will return.  F"}
{"text":"Wow!  The fettuccini is home made and outstanding. The Friday night special included shrimp mussels calimari lobster tail fettuccini in a red sauce. That and the night music with Debbie and Vito singing made the night special. The only negative is the 9 pm close but they still welcomed you in even with 10 minutes to close.  Thank you Sonia for the outstanding service."}
{"text":"Wow real Italian food it was awesome and the service by Jody was great also didn't get his name but I believe it was the owner was gracious. Thanks you"}
{"text":"Went around 5. Walked in and was shocked by the ambiance. Clean, dimly lit, piano player.  Was looking for Sinatra. Sat at the bar. Great wines and apps."}
{"text":"Our favorite little wine bar with tasty American- Italian food. The lasagna is as good as my mothers and she's from Rome .  Wonderful fresh mussels and clams , beautiful appetizers and the wines are the icing on the cake ."}
{"text":"Love this place great food and incredible atmosphere. It's a great place to bring a date on the live piano nights, the food is top quality authentic Italian and for the price there is none better. By far my favorite Italian restaurant in AZ. If your craving Italian food don't waste your money at Olive garden or bebbos this place makes them look like McDonald's. If I could give them 10 stars I would just writing about it makes me hungry I'm going for lunch now."}
{"text":"My father and I walked in and we were the only customers there.  We were seated, placed our drink and food order.  A couple walked in and said they were just going to look at the menu at the bar.  After a few minutes they decided to be seated, ordered and received their food as dad and I still sat waiting for our food.  The heavy set gentleman asked if we wanted our coffee and Soda refilled as I declined.  We will no longer return as all our previous visits were very nice and prompt.  We didn't even get our bread prior to being served our meals like previous visits we were served bread and some delicious spread when we got our drinks.  Today we received 4 pieces of bread with frozen butter.  No thanks, we will take our business to another local eatery."}
{"text":"Their food is all made like homemade! Love their pasta, pizza, calamari and fresh bread!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice Italian restaurant and the experience was positive. The Minestrone soup was phenomenal, the absolute best I've had in Arizona! It was nice to listen to the singer and the piano player while dining. The chef was very personable and observed him greet people throughout the restaurant, including our table. He even took time out to explain how to properly pronounce certain food in Italian. The place, with a beautiful atmosphere was packed and every table was full. Our waitress was sweet and considerate. It's a great place to go out for celebrating or on a date. This is a place I definitely go back to and highly recommend. I'm hanging on to the magnet because I seriously don't think I will get in without reservations! Dolce Vino is a fantastic and refreshing new Italian restaurant you must try!"}
{"text":"On the outskirts of historic downtown Glendale in the midst of taco stands and Mexican bread shops seemingly on every corner, lies this great little Italian restaurant.  My wife and I have found a hidden gem!  The service was great, the food was excellent, and the ambiance was relaxing.  Both of us had house specials.  My wife had the lobster ravioli and I had the lobster fra diavalo. Both dishes were superb!  You must save room for dessert however, because the tiramisu is out of this world good!!   Our server told us it is made in house and the chef spends a lot of time making it. It was very light and creamy and not too sweet. With a dearth of mom and pop Italian restaurants in Glendale we will definitely be coming back to this place and highly recommend it to all of you Yelpers!!"}
{"text":"Cool little Italian restaurant with a laid-back atmosphere. Not the cheapest place in town but pretty good food. The live music on the weekends is pretty cool. If you're in the mood for Italian this place is definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  On a Wednesday night with nothing planned my hubby and I were looking for a new Italian place to eat. Dolce came up near by and we were on our way. It's kinda hidden at night but worth it. Walked in and a huge smile on my face as a piano player sat in the corner. He's there Wednesday and Thursday nights. And with live singer weekends. The staff was friendly and very attentive. We had the wine list available and the selection was above expectations. We both had the chicken piccata and portions were excellent. Prices  are comparable. Just right. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Italian food in the heart of Glendale, Dolce Vino is the way to go! My brother had his wedding reception here and the service was outstanding! The prices are decent and we really felt like we got taken cared of. The food is terrific and they really go the extra mile. The bread is always freshly baked and the chef is here, every night - so every dish is customizable to your taste.   DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, where do I start. Let me preface this by saying that the predecessor of this location was one of my favorite places of all time. It may make me a bit biased.   That being said, I wish the food was as good as the conversation.  Don't get me wrong, it was not bad, it was just not memorable.  In all fairness, I was treated to a sample of the desert, home made spumoni, which was delicious. The home made bread was good as well.   The disappointment lies in the entree. I ordered a classic, Chicken Parmigiana. Everything was cooked well, but the red sauce lacked body and depth. Seasoning was needed for my palate.   The ownership is so fun that I enjoyed a 20 minute conversation. That and the dessert brought me from 3 to 4 stars. The place is a bit new, and I love supporting local restaurants so I will try the food again. The menu is classic and I hear the seafood is great."}
{"text":"You can tell this is homemade. Ernesto is the owner- gave us a free dessert, this is an amazing find! This is a relaxed atmosphere, great wine selection, and even better food! You can tell this place is here because of the owner and he is having a good time with his work- it is enjoyable to be a part of it!"}
{"text":"Marginal food, marginal atmosphere, who makes a vodka tonic without a lime? I ordered an appetizer and salad and expressly told the waitress that this is my dinner. But she served my calamari and salad with the salads. The calamari was very sub average so i sent it back for the dinner entree ciopinno. It was just ok. We also orde ed a ceasar salad, just average. The shrimp ernesto was overwhelmed with cognac. They had live music from a karaoke,  we requested a song, they never played the song.  Won't come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Food was great, and the customer service was even better! I ordered the chicken parmesan, a Caesar salad,  a cabernet, and a tiramisu. Every single bite was heavenly and more then worth the cost."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  Great Owners with a commitment to the community.  I will continue to support this place as long as I can.  Good work Vino! Love you all very much."}
{"text":"Dolce Vino Wine bar Italian restaurant has a great wine dinner atmosphere. I had the stuffed Rigatoni along with the dinner Caesar salad it was delicious with the Red dinner wine Will recommended this place for great Italian food and wine bar  cozy spot Will plan on coming back soon ."}
{"text":"We went to check out what the new owners were serving since taking over from Polo. We were monthly if not weekly regulars when this location was Polo's. We found the menu and service pedestrian. We had to ask for water. White wine was not served in the type of glass usually reserved for white wine. The salads were so-so. My wife said her spicy chicken cacciatore was fine. The chicken parmigiana I had was ordinary. I had to ask for a spoon to eat the spaghetti. Entertainment was provided but it was not Robyn Maynes and his family. Apparently, the establishment does offer a happy hour menu but it only available at the bar.  I see many positive reviews of this restaurant - I wish the owners well."}
{"text":"It was a pretty quiet week night as my husband and I were the only two customers.  Food was delicious, atmosphere was nice, restaurant was clean.  I really appreciated that our server wasn't over compensating by coming to our table too often.  She was very polite and answered all my questions.  We will definitely be back, probably on one of the nights they have live music."}
{"text":"The food and service were exceptional.  My new favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"New favorite place with AMAZING  food!!! We had the mussels in garlic sauce as an appetizer  and I had the manicotti.. TO DIE FOR!! Staff was very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable with offering suggestions as to what wine goes with our meals. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Wow! The best chipino I've ever had in my 57 years of living. For 18$ & change I was rewarded with a huge plate of mixed seafood on a bed of linguine and sitting in a bath of exquisite , smokey, tomato sauce.  I took two pictures: the first was as it was served to me at the bar and the next an empty plate that had nothing but shells.  Enjoy!  And get here on a night with music. Don't forget to ask Tim about what wine wine pare with your food."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants ever been the owner is amazing changed up menu for wife outstanding service or recommend them into anybody. Thx a billion. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My mom and I were in search of a place to grab a small bite to eat and glass of wine. Wow, did we ever get lucky with finding this little gem.  We sat at the bar and had a glass of Chianti and chose the soup and salad off the lunch menu. The French Onion soup was delicious and the salad very fresh and tasty.  We also split the steamed clams which I can't stop thinking about. The clams were succulent and tender and the broth was to die for, I could have drank it like soup but decided to be more lady like and dunk the homemade French Bread in it instead.  The owner came out and talked with us for awhile, very very nice gentleman. We tried the spumoni and it was amazing!! He makes that as well and hands down was the best I've ever had, I can't wait to go back and try the canoli!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. Live singer and pianist. The staff went out of their way to make my fathers bday dinner special. They learned how to sing happy Birthday in Italian and were very attentive during the entire course. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have had an upset stomach three times after eating here. I think that the sauces were out of date. The food is mostly boring. Boyardee might be better. There is nothing exciting to eat. The wait staff is very slow in response. I think the food is overpriced. The live music is great."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved in the historic part of Glendale, and the only thing we have missed is a local Italian eatery that we loved near our previous home.  After trying this place, that is no longer an issue.  Service was fantastic.  We loved our waitress.  The owner even came out to greet us, and pointed on the map where in Italy he was from.  The food we ordered was rather stunning, and the owner seems to go out of his way to ensure his dishes are authentic.  The cognac flavoring in the Shrimp Ernesto was like nothing I have ever had.  Come to find out, Ernesto is the owner and it is his recipe.  Had to shake his hand once I found out. My wife ordered the lasagna, which was also fantastic.    There were two homemade desserts on the menu that night.  We ordered one, the Tiramisu, which was the best I've had.  Ernesto himself brought out the other dessert (spumoni) after, which was on the house.  Part of the spumoni dish is soaked in a red wine.  I generally would not order spumoni, but I did not know it could be such a unique dish.  To top it all off, Ernesto gave a rose to my wife at the end of our meal, thanked us for coming, and we left super stoked about having this place less than a mile away.  We had a Groupon too, which often seems to come with less than enthusiastic treatment from a service standpoint.  Not here, which we made up for with a well earned tip.    My wife took a few friends there 2 nights later, and reported back that it was just as good.  Ernesto still came out, and the live piano music was delightful, which they do on Fridays and weekends.    I don't write reviews often, but I want to do my part to make sure this guy Ernesto stays in business in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Yum ordered take out and they delivered through Grub Hub fast! Loved it. Next I will go to their wine bar and try it out. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"The relaxing atmosphere with soft piano music goes great with delicious food and great wine selection. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"My name is Fred Ginnetti, my wife Cindy and I had the pleasure of eating at this authentic Italian restaurant. I was very pleasantly surprised at how really good it was, because usually, unless you're in New York or Chicago you don't really find real good Italian restaurants. This is by far the best Italian restaurant I've been to in Phoenix, I will definitely go back and tell all my friends. Everything is homemade including the bread, and for those Italian enthusiasts out there, the sauce is absolutely phenomenal thank you for the wonderful experience, we will be back"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful birthday lunch at La Dulce Vino Wine Bar.  Thank you for the excellent food, service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Incredible atmosphere with live jazz music. The staff were all very knowledge about there amazing wine selection. Chocolate lovers must try the flourless chocolate cake it's like fudge. A perfect place to take your family or for a night out with the girls."}
{"text":"Wow I am normally one for first impressions... However another manager/owner came by and started making things more than right for our table. One thing that we were having problems with conflict in was the service vs the relaxation endured by the ambience of a very relaxed environment with live piano/entertainment.  Locals have a place here and there is reason.  The food is outstanding. The desserts were one cloud shy of heaven: the homemade Spinoni or homemade Cannoli or the flourless chocolate cake were superb!"}
{"text":"Had the lentil soup, ate some calamari, mussels and caprese salad as well. As an entree, I had the Shrimp Ernesto. Absolutely superb! The seasoning was perfect on everything. For dessert I had the flourless chocolate cake than can only described as a rich dark chocolate fudge cake that solves a chocolate lovers dream or turn one into a chocolate addict. Chef Ernesto is an amazing chef. Tim Bulger is an excellent  sommelier and the wine always pairs beautifully. The live music from Bridget and the Aug was amazing and a delight to listen to. A most talented pair. Come here soon and come here often. I cannot explain how much you will love this little gem in Glendale, AZ."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, Great food, pianist playing great jazz, Great food, relaxing ambiance, awesome service oh and did I mention - GREAT FOOD!  If you know authentic homemade Italian food you will love this place!! Welcoming and very helpful staff, the owner Ernesto takes pride and puts his HEART in his dishes! A Diamond in the rough, I recommend this place for a first date, 10th to 50th anniversary or if you are just looking for somewhere nice, relaxing and special to take people you LOVE, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food at excellent prices! Try the shrimp Ernesto,  you will not be disappointed.  The service is outstanding and they have a great wine list."}
{"text":"Hadn't heard of this place before but my smarter half bought a Groupon Coupon for it and what a deal it turned out to be!  We started out with the zucchini parmigiana and it was very tasty indeed.  We moved on to the main course of pizza and salad.  Delicioso!  It was very cool that the owner/chef took the time to visit and make sure that his customers were satisfied, and we were!  Thank you Ernesto and our server, Vida, who made our dining experience a very nice one."}
{"text":"Outstanding  We drove from Corte Bella for a birthday celebration relying on Yelp comments A must go to place"}
{"text":"The woman who served me was great. Very nice. The atmosphere is pretty. I just did not think the food was anything to write home about. It was not bad at all but not great.  All the 5 star reviews really surprise me. I am picky about Italian food and bread. I had a sausage sandwich and it was okay but nothing earth shattering. Maybe i ordered the wrong thing? I will go back and try something else and rewrite a review. Until next time."}
