I ordered take-out thai crispy chicken and pad thai for a lunch special which included a mango salad and spring rolls. The salad and spring rolls were nothing special, still good. I guess I had high expectations for the pad thai since all over the stall were signs saying they served authentic thai food. The pad thai was good but there was  an after taste that I didn't really like. It was nice that the peanuts came in a separate little baggy to avoid cross contamination. The thai crispy chicken was just that - crispy chicken, but the spicy sweet sauce that came with it was really good. 

Out of everything that spicy sweet sauce was the saving grace.
They are peanut allergy friendly (not peanut-free) which is hard to find at a thai place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. If you can, call ahead to order because they do take a while to prepare your food. Their food is not oily at all. And have true spice ingredients.  Love their pad tai and tom yam Gon."}
{"text":"The portions are little compared with the price that you're paying. The food isn't all that authentic or is it really good. If you're looking for a quick fix for Thai food it's alright but it's better if you head to downtown if you want better tasting thai food. Over all it's worth 3 stars since the owner is really nice and willing to explain certain type of dishes. I orders the chicken pad Thai and asked for extra spicy it only came out to be mild for me. Therefore, I can safe to say I won't be coming again unless I'm really in need for Thai food and everything else is closed."}
{"text":"I came here looking for a quick lunch after a morning at the gym.  It's located in the food court.

I ordered the Steamed fish in banana leaf.  The fish was tender, lying on top of some steamed cabbage, and lightly spiced.  My friend had the pad thai and this one was the winner!  It was not overly oil, and they used spices (paprika) instead of ketchup and artificial food colouring.  So as a girl who enjoys healthy eating, thumbs up!

I packed up a dessert too, the Mango with purple stick rice.  It had the perfect amount of sweetness.  It was so filling, I had to share it with my mom.

I don't normally eat at a foodcourt, but I enjoyed this place and would come back again!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars out of 5 I would! I can not say enough good things about this place! The food was incredibly delicious. The crispy Thai chicken was full of flavor and had a great balance between salty and spicy would a hint of sweet while also being juicy and crispy. I can't wait to come back to try their other dishes which I'm sure will be just as good if not better! 

And if the incredible flavor wasn't enough for you the prices is great (~$10). You tell me where else you can find food this good for these prices. 

Long story short : if you are looking for a place that serves incredibly delicious, authentic Thai food at great prices then this is the spot. Please do yourself a favor and try this place out."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food. Located in the food court at Shoppes at the Parkway.

Came here for lunch and ordered the Steamed fish wrapped in banana leaf. I had to wait 20 min. for the fish, but totally worth the wait! It was really good! spicy! delicious - so good!.
It came with a side of rice, salad, drink and spring roll for $9 bucks! that's a steal!
Also ordered the iced Thai milk tea. I remembered having better in Thailand. It was a bit too sweet and lacking in any tea flavour for my liking. It was like sugar water.

I tasted my friend's green curry. It was flavourful and spicy, but was on the salty side. 

I chatted up the store owner and learnt that you won't find some of these thai dishes anywhere in town because you can't find the sauces and ingredients in Toronto. So the chef has to make the sauce from scratch!  (ie. the Pork Ka Pao and steam fish)

I can't wait to come back and try the other dishes.! yum yum!
( I really hope they will last in this food court. It's really quiet.)"}
{"text":"had a wonder dinner combo here with wife, both of us really enjoy the food, the place is clean, the price is great, and the husband and wife team owner are super nice and polite, will definitely return to try more, a hidden gem in Richmond Hill and for anyone who likes authentic thai food"}
{"text":"I can only speak for the green curry, meant to try something else on the menu but its just too delicious so I keep ordering it. Hands down best I've ever had. The green curry comes in a generous portion and is packed with flavor, not greasy, and also very spicy so make sure to specify the level of heat you can handle! If you're around the area, be sure to give Thai 5 a try and you'll be back often. If you're not close by, then its definitely worth the commute :)"}
{"text":"What a treat!! I come straight here everytime I travel to San Francisco. May even make it again tomorrow. Green curry shrimp is my favorite but looking around it all looks awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the lunch special meal which had red curry chicken, tom yoon soup and a spring roll. Total was around 12 tax included. The red curry chicken was quite good and as well as the tom yoon soup. Spicy and tasty.

The owners seem quite nice and took her time to explain me about the various thai dishes since i was not very experienced on it. It shows that what they make is the real deal. I will for sure come back to try their different dishes"}
{"text":"Okay ... So I've written many a review for Thai places that are holes in the wall ... I can't call this place by that phrase because it is more of a mall food court kiosk than a stand alone place.  In this Asian influenced area of Richmond Hill in Toronto it seems many small restaurants are set up this way.  Limited menu selection, but compared to the place next door (counter), who appears to have everything, that may be okay.  Lots of press posted about awards and good reviews.   Food yet to come.  

Btw - ambience ... There is none.  It's a mall.  I'm staying at the hotel across the street and felt like Thai.  This is Fast Food Thai.   
Tried the chicken satay - chicken was a little tougher than I'm used to. No peanut sauce, which I prefer.  Good flavor. 
Tom Yom soup - very good flavor but struggling with plastic spoon, fork and paper plates. (Dislike)
The red curry - not nearly the red broth I am used to.  good cooked in flavor. I ordered spicy and it did its job as evidenced by the beads of sweat on my forehead.  
I would eat here again.  Ps. Cash only.  Friendly and hard working couple."}
{"text":"Located in the food court below the Sheraton on 7 and Leslie; go in from the mall entrance beside The Host, and just walk straight towards the back then you'll hit the food court.  

This is my new favorite Thai food join in town, even though they've been around for quite some time.  Portion is smaller than typical Markham food court , but for me it was just enough to have room for dessert after.  

Lovely green curry with shrimp, the best khao soi that I've ever had.  I will be going back often."}
{"text":"I am confident to say that this is one of the best, if not the best Thai food place in GTA. A hidden gem for sure, I used to work in the area but i don't anymore. In fact I live quite far away but I often drive all the way there to fix my cravings. Those of you who said 'too expensive and too small', this isn't the place for you, it isn't a bargain bin, but I think it's worth every cent because you just can't find this quality anywhere else. Question their authenticity?  I have had many dishes in Thailand and this is the real deal. I often have a hard time choosing what to order, and usually I order a dish to eat there and a few items to go!"}
{"text":"Service was good but this rating is based on the iced Thai milk tea. It was the most watered down milk tea, there was no taste or any distinct flavours of traditional Thai milk tea. Might as well order water!"}
{"text":"The bottom line: 
A perfect Muay Thai kick to your taste buds!!
 
What I ate: 
Red curry chicken with rice

What I think: 
This dish features some tender chicken, creamy red curry that is both sweet (but not overly) and spicy as well as a coconut flavour finish. 

The food is made to order so for all of you who can't eat spicy, they can add a pinch or a bucket full of spice. 

The cucumbers on the side as well as other vegetables help give the dish an added freshness so overall it's a great balance of taste. 

This is one well made red curry and I've been all over town. The only one I would compare it to is khao san road downtown. That place is great too. 

What I saw:
It's a small shop in a business mall and the feeling you get from the food is personal and home made. This might be because the owners of the shop are very independent and truly enjoy making the food and hearing that you loved it. They are just genuinely happy and proud to hear that. They're in it to make money of course but the happiness they get from you enjoying their cooking makes it special. 

Final thoughts:
If you enjoy Thai food, try this hidden gen of the GTA. I will be coming back to try and review more items."}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food (specifically Khao soi) and happened to stumble on this place in my search. Even though this place was located in the food court, I decided to take a chance because of the high ratings. It did not disappoint; the Khao soi and red curry dishes were so good! It was creamy and packed with flavours. It was authentic and tasted almost as good as Khao San Road."}
{"text":"Totally would not expect this place to be so on point. Friendly and informative staff with delicious Thai food. Super helpful owner that will make suggestions if you're not sure what to get. Personally, I love the steamed fish wrapped in banana leaf. Soft, delicate with coconut essence...it was great! Prices are fair relative to other thai restaurants and portions are okay, (a little on the small side) but still worth a visit. Try the thai tea too, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Food court Business like this should have a fair price. That's why there are not that many people come. Tom yum soup for almost $9. Chicken is not fresh. For this price, I would prefer to sit down in a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I wholeheartedly agree with others that this is truly a hidden gem. I have never been in Shoppes of the Parkway up til today. The prices are very decent. Under $8 for most dishes. Currently running a promo, add $1 for a spring roll and free water or green tea. I think water should be free regardless, no? 
Ordered a Thai iced milk tea, chicken pad thai and green curry chicken, both mild heat and it was perfect. I like how there's just enough veggies in each dish to go along with it. Some dishes gets overcrowded with bean sprouts or such to take up room. The portions are perfect for lunch, generous amount of rice for the curry and noodles for the pad thai. The milk tea is not overloaded with ice which I love. The taste is not too sweet which isn't authentic because ones in Thailand are very sweet. I guess it caters to Canadians' taste buds more.
The lady manning the front (seems to be the owner?) is very sweet and she tries to upsell us with fish cakes. I mention a lunch combo with mango salad and she is honest to say it is no longer included because of the price fluctuation in mangoes. I can respect that. 
If you ignore the food court set-up, the food is really decent!"}
{"text":"I tried the pad Thai during lunch hour since this food court is close to my office. 

Their pad Thai is not impressive (compare to Thai Express at least). The portion is small, noodles is soft, and the dish tastes plain to me. Not sure if this is how authentic Thai food should be."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try out this place. I love pad Thai and actually wanted to order pad thai. However I saw that they are also selling khao soi! I had the khao soi from khao San road and I loved it! And it would be great if this one turns out to be good! Since it's much closer to home. So I  thought I'll give it a try.

As a food court item it's not cheap. It's $11 while other food is generally selling at around $6. The owner was quite nice and talked to me while I was waiting for my noodles..,, saying that she's also selling macarons. Anyways my noodles was finally ready and..... Hummmm it's not as good as I thought it would be.

First the noodles wasn't egg noodles. It was just some Guilin rice noodles. And it was over cooked.... Sooo soft.
Then the soup, perhaps the one at khao San road was sooo rich I thought the soup has to be rich. But this one isn't. Perhaps it lacked the coconut milk....
The rest was just ok, some chicken some carrot some crispy stuff. Since the crispy stuff wasn't as thick as khao's it got softened by the soup very quickly. 

All in all, I may not want to have this particular dish from thai5, but I'll come back to try the pad Thai. Also they have combo for one and combo for two which include pad Thai or curry as the main and spring roll, mango salad, or Tom yum Gung soup as appetizer at around $10/person."}
{"text":"I like that you can specify the level of spiciness here.  I ordered a \"hot\" chicken pad thai.  My regret.  It was hurting-myself-/-what-was-I-thinking hot.  The flavour was bold -  a mixture of sour and spice.  There was a lot of noodle, but I shoveled it down my throat so fast.  The noodle was just so smooth/slippery and tasty.  The portion of the chicken was okay.  Was it really authentic?  Not 100% sure.  I was, however, sure that this pad thai was a decent lunch item."}
{"text":"Great location (food court), free parking, easy to find, few stairs to climb, but the mall has an elevator as well. Lovey people. Family business. Inexpensive descent lunch within $10 budget. Awesome customer service. I'll come back one day."}
{"text":"This is a definite hidden gem. Tried spicy chicken rice, very delicious and different! The food is very akin to what I had in Thailand. The lady is super nice and even instructed me on how long to heat the dessert in microwave. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent, I was surprised to have found it a small food court in Markham/Richmond Hill . The owners are very caring and make the food from scratch. I have had the red curry and green curry with chicken, also had one of the soups. Everything is great, the Green curry being my favourite. It can get quite spicy, but you can order it mild if you need to...it tastes better medium though. Prices are very reasonable, cash only, an entrée with a spring roll and a small mango salad is $12 I believe"}
{"text":"Located in the food court of the shoppes of parkway behind Esso on Highway 7.

The friendly cash lady recommended a meal for 2 for me and my husband. It came with 1 salad (mango salad), 2 tum yum soup, 2 spring rolls, choose 2 main (pad Thai & green curry chicken with rice), some shrimp chips for about $30. A bit pricey for food court. The portions are good, the flavor was alright. There were way more rice & noodles in the main than the actual meat/veg. For dine-in, but still put in to-go container, there're 2 small dessert taro cakes, tested more like sweet potato cake to me. 

Personally like the one across more. This one's flavor is less flavorful and not enough meat/veg. And this one is pricier."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch and it took almost an hour to be ready. Food is not bad but nothing special. When you crave for thai food its a good place to go to. I ordered the steam fish in banana leaf and red curry chicken with rice, both are good. Will try the khao soi on my next visit"}
{"text":"Thai 5 Cafe is located in a really dead plaza where only the locals and lunch time business crowd know about.  

Was in the area and wanted to try something new and settled on Thai 5 Cafe.  Its a husband and wife food court place and I guess their claim to fame is that's it certified Thai by the Thai government according to its certificate.

The wife was working alone when I arrived and I have to admit she is really sweet and welcoming to her food stall.  I ended up getting a dinner for one combo and chose the pad thai with chicken, vegetable tom yum soup and Thai spring roll for the meal.  I asked for extra spicy and she said \"You sure?? That is really hot!\". My eyes lit up as I always take that as a challenge and said \"Of course!!!!\"

The food is really good here.  The pad thai noodles were done perfectly and the tom yum soup was excellent as I love the fact that it was more tart then most places.  The spring roll was good but a little small.

Its a bit expensive for a food court but the quality is there and the customer service was really friendly as I always love supporting family run businesses.

As for the extra spicy I handled it no problem!  I'm gonna have to ask for double extra spicy next time to satisfy my chili obsession!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars actually...
A nice place if you are on the go. Their Combo menu is value for money, as they offer 3-course meals for around 10 $ . The portions are decent, but they add curry over rice, instead of giving them separately. The flavour of food is really good, but the spice level is not standard, we ordered 3 meals- green curry, chicken red curry, and pad thai. The first two were fine but later one was burning hot, although we ordered everything medium spicy. I loved their veg. spring rolls, mango salad. My hubby ordered a tom yum soup, it was fine too.

The drinks : Thai Iced Tea & Bubble Tea were a big no-no!

P.S. It's a small stall with 2-3 tables in the mall."}
{"text":"Hidden gem inside the parkway food court.  What I love about this place besides the great food, is that it's a husband and wife operation.  The couple are extremely hard working and very very sweet.  

Great food, great people - can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken Pad Thai today and it's as amazing as you'd get on the streets of Thailand! Fresh mango salad is very refreshing and we can't wait to try the macaroons made by Lisa next time."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken curry rice! I tried a few items on their menu this weekend and they were all delicious. The service was fast and Lisa was an absolute joy to talk with. If you are ever in the area I highly recommend the curry rice and the refreshing mango salad."}
{"text":"I've been in Thailand many times and this is by far the most authentic and tasty Thai food I have found in the GTA. Run by a sweet husband-wife couple. Please support them, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem! 

This family run food joint is a restaurant disguised as a fastfood joint. Ok, so it technically is a fastfood place, tucked inside a food court. But the quality of the food they produce is definitely restaurant quality! I absolutely love their green curry chicken and Thai tea! I cannot handle an ounce of spice, but the curry is so good, I couldn't figure out whether I'm crying of pain or bliss with every spoonful because I just can't stop eating it. I also normally don't eat rice, but the green curry sauce mixed with the rice is divine! Gobbled it all up! They make their Thai tea less sweet than the traditional, which for me is the perfect amount! (Traditional Thai tea is sooo sweet, probably sweeter than bbt)

The husband and wife team are absolute sweethearts and you really feel appreciated being one of their patrons. Also, if you ever have a chance to chat with the wife, you'll find out she studied culinary cuisine in France and can whip up some delicious macarons made to order! :) 

Green curry with rice + Thai tea + macarons + lovely folks and service = makes me one happy camper. :)

Definitely recommend and I already go often :)"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times - great little Thai café. 

The green curry chicken is amazing, so flavorful with a bunch of different veggies and can be ordered to your desired amount of spiciness. I also really enjoyed the crispy chicken with the honey/spice dip, nice thin batter so you don't feel bloated afterwards. 

Owners are so nice and informative as well. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Thai 5 Cafe is located at the food court inside the Shoppes of Parkway.

It is not easy to open up a business in this mall as it is really really quiet... 

Thai 5 Cafe does realize that so aside from Thai food, they have sandwiches, breakfast specials and even afternoon tea set. I guess diversification is the key to survival.

My boyfriend works in the area so he is a frequent  the few  business in the food courts there.  I ended up having a taste of his lunch which is always the case.

The club sandwiches he had for a few time was not really up to par. The meat in the sandwich was hard and dry. HK style milk tea was meh too.

Maybe Thai 5 Cafe should stick with just offering Thai food. 

I am eyeing the Durian Sticky Rice... but when I passed by today, they don't have that only the Mango version!"}
{"text":"Great food reasonably priced. Amazing crispy chicken.  I will return!!!"}
