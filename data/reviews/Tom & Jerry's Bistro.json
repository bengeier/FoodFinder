{"text":"Very good wings, they are my favorite place to go for wings.  Either for dine in or take out.  Although it has been my experience that dine in wings are better than take out.  Their wings aren't very saucy although they do have Buffalo style wings which I haven't tried yet, they may be saucy.  They have about six different ways to have your wings, from mild to suicide.   I like their onion chips, but if you get heart burn I would stay away from them.  There fries are soooooo gooooood which come with the wings.  Also they have this dill dipping sauce that I am addicted to.    The service is very good and very friendly.  On Tuesday they have cheap wing night.  The wings are half price.  They place is small so if you're going Tuesday get there early or late because around dinner time they are busy.   Overall, good wings and friendly service, they provide a good and inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid with my father! Great wings onion chips and the dill sauce is just amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great specials daily  (wing night,  kids eat free, rib night,  etc). And delicious chicken wings with a great in - house special sauce."}
{"text":"Foods okay.  I live nearby though and its my irritation with them as a neighbour that keeps me from returning.  The annoying orange spotlight in the back alley means we have to have room darkening blinds to sleep at night.  The worst though is that windows can't be left open at night because of the people coming out to smoke and the stench coming into the house.  That is definitely not always cigarette smoke.  On the rare occasion there's no smoke they bang around with the garbage cans and set the dogs off barking. Screaming drunks used to be a big problem, but that seems a little better lately.  Seriously though, they need to consider the effect of their business on the neighbours."}
{"text":"Great wings Great fries Great sauce . Really the best wings in town. Servers are very nice. We have been to all the locations Aurora the original is small and cam be very loud on a friday/Saturday night it's a local pub with great food. Count your wings . We ordered 100 wings and fries and got 84 not sure why we counted but we did. Complaint came with an explanation that the menu is wrong it says 100 but should be 90 so they served 90.  Lol the bill is $137.00 I should discount it 10% the way they do.  And save a few dollars."}
{"text":"I have never been to this location specifically.  HOWEVER, the Newmarket location is so phenomenal, that I was upset i could only give a 5/5 rating.  Thus, my rating has spilled over to the Aurora location which i can only assume is only as incredible as their Newmarket location.   Greatest wings, EVER.  Period.  No questions asked. Eating wings here is like a religious experience, It opened my eyes to new horizons.  I never new a chickens appendage could fill my mouth with such borderline-orgasmic pleasure. From the crispy outer skin, to the juicy tender insides, every bite is a roller coaster of taste nirvana.  I'm sure they have other menu options but who cares?  Ordering anything but Wings here is like going to Champagne France and getting a beer.  If you have never had wings here I pity you and my thoughts go out to you and your family. You owe it to not only yourself, but your friends, family and even your country, to visit Tom and Jerry's and get a pound of wings."}
{"text":"I dropped in today with a friend for lunch as it was half price wing day. When we arrived just before noon the place was almost empty but filled up fast so it was good we ordered right away. The wings were excellent as I remembered and the service was lousy as I also remembered. Our waitress made it a point of sitting with some of the customers instead of taking orders but as it got busier she simply dissappeared. The wings came out hot and tasty and the beer was cold. I would have ordered another beer but our server was inattentive and not around much. I had to chase her down for the bill. Not much of a tip for not much service."}
{"text":"It's about the daily lunch specials. Friday happened to be ribs and wings day for $14. Half a rack, a half dozen wings and a basket of beefeater fries is a pretty good deal. I'm not sure where the ribs are from, but they are not bad at all, considering I'm used to paying upwards of $20 just for a half rack of ribs at a really good rib joint.   Keep in mind, this is primarily a bar, and looks like it. It probably gets busiest around happy hour and through the night as patrons watch sports on the various tv's.  if you're in the area and in need of some pub food, this is as good as any."}
{"text":"Love this place, wings are best around, so much cleaner the coops that I now take the family"}
