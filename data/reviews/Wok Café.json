{"text":"Probably one of the best tasting Chines places in the West Island. Have been going here for over a year and it is pretty consistent. Food is good, large portions and value for your money. If you can't make it to the hood (Cote-de-Neiges) then this is a pretty good second choice. Try it and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good portion sizes but way too much on the menu. The bathroom was utterly disgusting and had fruit flies infested throughout the bathroom.  Friendly waiter though!"}
{"text":"They have nice service nothing extraordinary.

For appetizer, they have spring rolls.

Their food Is good and you can order custom meals ex: black bean soy sauce with beef but Instead of rice noodles with chemein noodles.

For desert they have fun fortune cookies.

Keep in mind I'm not a criric. I am just an average shy person."}
{"text":"worst general tao on the planet, my chicken came uncooked with no sauce. personally theres way better tao places in montreal like star noodles on st marc and st catherine"}
{"text":"Very good food. Casual place to go and great prices for what u get. Beer had a bad meal and I am a regular. I recommend  it"}
{"text":"I was looking for good general tao and as per google this was the place so I decided to give it a try.
The place was clean and the staff very friendly. The menu is huge so took a while to check everything out. 
We took one general tao combo, one szechuan shrimp and tried some dim sum. The general tao was good but not the best I had for sure but the szechuan shrimp was awful. The plate was covered in sauce and the shrimp were so blend no taste at all.
The combo came with a wonton soup and it was ok but again the broth needed a little more seasoning.
The dim sum took about 20 min to come and they were ok but a strong taste of citronella kind of ruined it for me.
The size of the plates was decent and the prices were actually really good.
I might give it another try but will see"}
{"text":"Quantity over quality. Not at all authentic!

Having been to Wok cafe quite a few times in this particular location, my last meal there was nothing more than an absolute disappointment. 

We arrived on a Saturday afternoon around 2:45pm for lunch time. We were famished.  When I say \"we\" I meant three of us. Not at all a large group. 
The restaurant was rather quiet with four other tables being occupied, aside from ours. Each table had 2-3 client. 

For our meal, we ordered vegetable fried rice and sweet & sour pork. Nothing complicated or elaborated, right? That's what I thought. 
However.. 45 minutes later, our order has not been served to any of us. That's right, 45 minutes! Keep in mind, the tables around us who arrived after we did, were already served and eating. How are we still waiting?!
I politely asked our waiter.. What happened to our food? He responded \"We don't prepare food according to the order the orders are placed, we do it in a random order\" We apologize. Also our cook were on break for 10 minutes. That's right.. While we were famished and waiting, they were chatting on their break. 

Finally our meals have arrived! Was a I happy now? Absolutely not. General Tao chicken was lukewarm. The \"sticky\" rice, was far from the authentic sticky rice any Chinese household would eat. The grains were tough, under cooked, and not sticky. The General Tao chicken had 90% batter with 10% of meat. The batter was tasty, yet drenched in a artificial tasting sauce, that tasted more dessert like, of how sweet it is. 

Luckily, the vegetable fried rice was descent, then again it's rice with frozen veggies. No, they were not fresh veggies. They simply used the frozen mix of peas and carrots among other things. Mixed with a unnecessary large amount of salty soy sauce. 

Cafe Work is mainly a place that focuses on reasonable prices(Inexpensive) with large amounts of foods, that do not focus at all on quality nor freshness. Much less authenticity. 

A little helpful fact that I will share with you! How do you know if a Chinese restaurant is authentic and good? Once you arrive, if you see most tables being occupied by Asians, that's an excellent sign! It means that they will eat there because it's as good as they would eat at their own home from meals their parents prepared them. It's traditional! 
Cafe Wok is far from being traditional, it has a much stronger taste of your typical Americanized non Asian meals. 

I'd say, steer away from Cafe Work(Either location) and take a little short drive to China Town. That's where you're most likely to find good quality, authentic, fresh, and warm food served to you. At the same price or lower. 

I also did not appreciate the pile of boxes, unorganized clutter and mediocre clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"We've been going to Wok Cafe for many years now and the owners and staff are very accommodating, very kind and the food is spectacular. So many people come from all over the island because the food is great and you just can't get quality Szechuan, cantonese and even dim sum food like this for great prices. A great place to go and to try out."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday evening with family for dinner.  Ordered General Tso Chicken, Shrimp Pad Thai, dumplings in Peanut Sauce and steamed rice.  

This is a casual local establishment.  I found the quality of the food to be high but there was nothing special about any of the dishes.  Nothing really popped.  Prices are reasonable and service was good."}
{"text":"From food to freshness to hospitality, It's all positive! I had the tofu mushroom and it was so tasty!! Not even vegetarian and sure didn't even miss meat!"}
{"text":"The food is great. They have some of the best general tso chicken in the west island. The portions are very reasonable. The dishes are prepared quickly. The staff is friendly and efficient. The restaurant is well situated and is easily accessible. For the price, it's definitely a great place to satisfy some Chinese food craving! I love the fact that they give a fortune cookie at the end."}
{"text":"A good place to get your North American Chinese food fix.  They also have an extensive list of authentic Chinese dishes that are very good.  

Having visited Wok Caf√©'s other locations, their food is good and consistent.

At this particular visit, I came for their lunch special - $8.95 for hot and sour soup, and General Tao chicken served with white rice and vegetables (brocoli and Napa cabbage).   

The soup had just the right amount of sour and kick to it.  It was thick (because of cornstarch?), and loaded with pieces of tofu, egg and bamboo shoots.

The General Tao pieces were large, chunky, and hard, but, don't worry, there were indeed chicken in there!  The sauce was thick (again, assuming because of corn starch) and was syrup-y.  I liked it; it satisfied my craving.

The staff that afternoon was courteous and conscientious.  The restaurant is clean, and the kitchen is in an open area. I recommend this place; this is my go-to place for authentic Chinese food on the West Island."}
{"text":"The hot and sour and the won ton soups were good the pan friend dumplings had no filling and were burnt . The Cantonese chow mein had lots of lot of noodles. Here was very  little chicken,pork and shrimp and cheap vegetables and way to much sauce which was like a gravy  ... It is cheap Chinese food and  server was no where to be found ..."}
{"text":"Ordered a satay noodle chicken. The dish came and there was no noodle , I asked them and they said oops ... took back the dish and it came back. The noodles were basically uncooked ... we told them again and they took back the dish and recooked the noodle .. and this round it came back too salty ... ridiculous ... first n last time we will frequent this place and I would advise folks to be weary of this place when eating here ...:"}
{"text":"After screwing up 2 different home cooked dinners, my gf and I decided we'd run here for take-out soup. 

Pros
- The staff was friendly
- The place looked clean
- The portions are very generous
- The food is well packed and secure

Cons
- My BBQ duck tasted like nothing
- My gf barely got any veggies in her veggie soup. She basically had a big bowl of broth with some cabbage and udon noodles

I heard good things about their general tao chicken, so I'll gladly give them another shot. However, when it comes to satisfying a soup craving, I'll be looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, full of flavor. I order using Just eat app for delivery. It's great."}
