{"text":"One of my favorites at Molisana's is their pizza because they make it without mozzarella cheese. My understanding is that they make their own sauce with olive oil and fresh tomatoes, their own crust, and the only cheese on the pizza is parmesan. It's delicious, fresh tasting, and not too heavy.  They also have a great tasting cookie that I treat myself to once in a while that is I think and almond cookie with apricot jam and slivered almonds. So good!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and baked goods.  Really charming little restaurant and friendly owners.  Glad that we have a local place like this in the Broadview Heights area.  Check out their excellent espresso as well!"}
{"text":"I love this little gem in the neighborhood.   I frequently go in for their signature olives, lasagna sheets, ditalini (hard to find around here) and san marzano tomatoes.   It's also one of the few places I can find Lucatelli cheese.   Waiting in a long line today with everyone buying bread, I decided to step out of line and get a loaf.  Good idea!  There is a popular bakery next door, but this bread...well I would drive 40 miles for it...it was fantastic.  I bought the pugliese because they had just sold out of the ciabatta...I suspect i will be there frequently for this  bread alone.   I hope they continue to thrive so they are always just around the corner.   Take the drive here, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I have to comment on their pizza as well. It's incredibly simple yet oh-so-amazingly delicious you wonder how they do it. It's Sicilian style and the only pizza which comes close to being as good (and, while similar it tastes very different) is Mazzone's on Clark.   If you live in the area and love pizza and haven't tried Molisana's you need to GO NOW and get some. If you're just passing through, make it a point to stop and get some. Here's a tip, though: They run out quickly during lunch time during the week so call ahead to have a slice (or four!) put aside. You will NOT regret it.   By the way, the rest of the store is very cool as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place.  I've been hesitant on writing a review only because the more people who find this gem...the more crowded it will be when I'm trying shop :)  I found this shop about 15 years ago when I moved to Broadview Heights, and even after moving out of the area...I'm still willing to drive the 30 minutes just to shop here.  The imported prosciutto and fontinella cheese are well worth the time in the car.  Add to that all of the other amazing food and I would honestly drive well over an hour to visit.  The staff is always friendly and helpful and even remembers me even though I'm no longer a regular.  Need some ideas about an appetizer you would like to serve?  Just ask and you'll end up with tons of options.  Don't miss out on these items - Pitted Olive Mix, Roasted Red Peppers, Marinated Eggplant, Antipasto Salad....who am I kidding...just order a pound of everything in the case!   Oh, and make sure you get a slice of pizza and/or a specialty sandwich while there."}
