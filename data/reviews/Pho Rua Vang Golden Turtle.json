{"text":"I am very pleased to have found this restaurant which is several cuts above other pho joints I have eaten in in the past thirty years. 

It starts with brilliant pho broth: here is a very complex , low salt highly complex broth . It reminds me of the broth used by the sadly gone White Lotus on Lansdowne that was my flagship spot  for excellence until it closed about three years ago.
Anyway hooray for excellent golden turtle broth. I had the soup last time which brought me back today.

I tend to evaluate using two or three standard dishes and today it was vermicelli with grilled pork, grilled shrimp and spring rolls. Verdict: massive shrimp lightly grilled, lots of tender pork and as in earlier visits very plump non- greasy spring rolls which I dipped in Hoisen sauce as an experiment.

My bowl of Bun had lots of mint and bean sprouts, and the accompanying sauce was not too vinegary all well balanced.

Overall extremely satisfying and served up with flair and professional skill in a very busy lunch hour. 

So I will go again though it puzzles me to see some negative reviewers dissing this place for another pho joint nearby. Guys, stay out of the commercial rivalry and avoid negativity! Life's too short."}
{"text":"noodle was good, too much green onion in my opinion, and most importantly, broth base was just so so. I felt like the soup wasn't even hot.

I got a well done, with tendon and tripe. And it came with 2 small piece of tripe, and some tiny pieces of tendon,  and some fatty meat... i should've just asked for a simple rare.

Their portion was decent, i was full with a S though bf managed to finish a XL...

a big minus was they only take CASH."}
{"text":"My hair dresser recommended this place for me. She told it's one of the only places that serves veggie pho. So...here we go:
-Pretty big menu...i wanted to order so many things...everything sounded SOOO good..next time I come here I'll try something other then their veggie pho
-Veg pho - 2/5: My cousin and I were excited that they actually served veg pho, but when we got the bowl...it was pretty small and BARELY any noodles. the soup tasted pretty good though...we wish the portions were a lot bigger. 
-Veggie spring rolls - 4.5/5: very crispy (which i LOVVVVEEE)! the sauce it came with complimented the spring rolls very well. 
-Avocado smoothie - 0/5: WORSE avocado smoothie ever..it wasn't even smooth! it was pure thick mush and it tasted like they used rotten avocados! 

OVERALL - 2.5/5: I'd stick to my Pho 88 @ Warden & Steeles (however, they do not serve vegan pho). Golden turtle is way too small, with barely no room...everyone is squished together. i will however, give this 2.5 stars for their spring rolls, a pretty big menu and for having veg pho."}
{"text":"Despite the popularity of this place, I have always been underwhelmed by the food.  Everything is \"fine\", but really, nothing more.   The soup is super salty, and you always have to be extra vigilant about making sure stuff is actually vegetarian.  I've received conflicting answers about the same dish.  It really shouldn't be that hard, it either is or it isn't.  

Also, I get that it's busy here, and they need to turn tables quickly, but service is always curt to the point of being rude."}
{"text":"Food - 2 
Service - 1

The pho is nothing special and none too different from a bowl of pho you could get anywhere else. Just the plainest of Janes. Where they distinguish themselves is in their service (the lack thereof) from being greeted by a surly young man who dry-wiped dirty tables with an old rag (Jesus be some disinfectant), to some too-cool-for-school conscripted tween laborer who unceremoniously slammed the bill on the table when we were not even half-way through, to one of the dozen aunties circling around the place like a flock of greedy, beady-eyed crows stopping by to hover around our table barking \"DONE? DONE? DONE?\" at such regular intervals that you could set a watch to it. Boyfriend had not given pause for more than a minute, leaning back to digest his lukewarm, thin oily broth when Auntie #12 scurried up, dumped his soiled napkins into his still full bowl and whisked it away without so much of a grunt of acknowledgement. I saw at least one of the other five tables not occupied by persons outside of the Turtle people's massive extended family given the same expeditious treatment. Meanwhile our intrepid tween laborer stood at the front of the restaurant treating patrons to some kind of pho rain dance alternating between rubbing her Uncle's (?) belly and thrusting her behind into his crotchal area. As we left, we were accosted by Uncle #48 who bodychecked us at the main door and gestured at us to exit through the side door into a dark alleyway. 

Golden Turtle, your place is hack and you embarrass yourself. I don't care if Susur allegedly ate here once ten years ago according to the questionable annals of Toronto eating folklore, but if he did I'm sure he didn't get to be incessantly harassed and treated like a pile of the hottest steamiest sh-t on the streets of Hanoi. Yelpers, do yourself a favor and head down to Pho Tien Thanh at 57 Ossington. We've been there six times and have only been treated with courtesy and piping hot pho that is tasty to boot, natch. Deeply regret straying."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a quick light meal whenever I'm in the area. Came here last night after watching a show across the street at the lower Ossington theatre. I always order the rare beef pho and avocado milk shake. The pho was definitely one of the best ive had in Toronto, the brooth was clean and flavorful and the beef thin and tender. The avocado milk shake was a good complement also made properly smooth and creamy as it should be! One major downfall of the restaurant was the bad service and almost too efficiency service making me feel rushed and unwelcome (hence I only give 3 stars).

Love: clean and flavorful brooth, good portion size

Hate: bad service, loud atmosphere"}
{"text":"i had some take out pho from here recently and really enjoyed it. also had the (non fried) appetizer rolls which weren't the best I've ever had, but tasty nonetheless. A good quick meal on the Ossington strip, for a good price."}
{"text":"The bowl servings are tiny compared to other Vietnamese Restaurants. A large bowl of pho is basically a medium with the noodle serving of a small. I ordered a Pho Dac Biet AKA #14 (Special Pho). The beef brisket was basically a piece of fat with no meat which was pretty disgusting because the fat seeped into my broth which made it all oily. My sister ordered the grilled pork on rice which i was able to taste and i thought it was better than what i had ordered. They served a reasonably big piece of meat with no blubber and it was cooked just right and not burnt like other places i have tried.Overall it was OK but i still prefer Pho Tien Thanh for my Pho which is actually just down the street from Golden Turtle. Only went to Golden Turtle cause Tien Thanh was closed on the wednesday i went."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my girlfriend to wait for our table across the street at the Rock Lobster. My girlfriend and I really needed to use the bathroom so we both immediately headed down there to do our business instead of grabbing our table first. A server was waiting for us at the top of the stairs on our way back and rudely said, \"You should ask to use the bathroom first. It's common courtesy.\" I didn't realize this was elementary school and we had to ask permission to take a piss before grabbing our table. Of course, this female server automatically assumed we weren't customers. Either that or she needed to blow off steam on someone after a long shitty day at work. Needless to say, we left and went to Pho Tien Thanh just down the street instead."}
{"text":"Pho's really good. Fresh ingredients and lots of flavour. Great atmosphere out on the patio as well"}
{"text":"Solid 3

Basic ass pho up the street from the best pho you can get in Toronto at Tien Tanh"}
{"text":"Food taste not bad BUT they automatically add tips (don't know how many percent) to your bills!! I feel it's very dishonest of them, because they don't let you know they already included tips to your total until you ask them to confirm! 

I've been here a few times and had always given tips IN ADDITION to the total they wrote on their paper receipt. It's only by fluke that when my family went to dine at the restaurant last week, my brother asked if they included tips and they said yes. They wouldn't have told us otherwise! I don't think there are any writings on the menu that says their total already includes tips. Very dishonest of the merchant to do something like this!! I would rather go to the other pho restaurant down the street, than dine here and pay double the tips for so-so service."}
{"text":"What they lack in customer service can not be made up in their food.  We were still drinking our milkshakes when they kicked us out.  Their food also went downhill since the last time I was there.  There are so many better pho places downtown you don't need to tolerant this kind of rude customer service."}
{"text":"If you want cheap food: come here. If you expect any kind of customer service: don't come here. It's always a classic dilemma between cheap eats and the surly glares of the waitresses. It's usually tasty enough to excuse it. But often it makes me never want to come back!"}
{"text":"One of the rudest, if not the rudest, restaurant in downtown Toronto!!!

I have eaten at this restaurant on several occasions. To be fair, the food can be good depending on what you order. 

But there is where it ends. The service tantamount to bordering rude. On past visits my friends and I have always overlooked the rudeness and abruptness of the proprietress. We are there for the food after all, not her companionship. 

But today it all changed. I went for a late lunch at around 2:30pm. I walked in to noticed a few tables were just finishing up their lunch. There were a lot of tables available, so I sat down on a table for four that was set up with menus. Even before I seated myself, a waitress approach me. Before she even got to me, I heard a grunt in Vietnamese from the proprietress. I looked up to enquire if I could sit at the table only to be rudely told no by the owner. She then indicated that I was to sit in the back - also a table for 4. I inquire why couldn't I sit at the first table since there were so many tables available, only to get a grunt of \"Cannot!\"

At that point, I just hit me - \"Why patronize a place where the owner is constantly so rude and dismissive to their customers?\" I just got up and walked out. 

I really don't understand how owners treat their bread and butter of their business in such manners. 

Needless to say, I shan't be going to this place again. My friends and I will no longer eat there but instead go to another pho restaurant just down the street called Pho Tien Than (I Love Pho Forever). 

Keep up with this attitude and you'll see this business going under soon!!!

You been warned Yelpers!!! If you want a sprinkle of rudeness and a dash of contempt in your food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Fast, efficient and good.  This place hits the spot when you're craving pho.
I got the pho with beef & tripe - broth was rich, beef & tripe were tender and noodles were well cooked. 
I also had the iced coffee which I found to be more ice than coffee.  
I was disappointed that they didn't have banh cuon which are rice rolls wrapped around ground meat served with fish sauce on the side that other pho restaurants in the area have."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years because it delivers the goods every time. Nothing fancy but good straight up Pho !  I find the service is fast and the food tasty. I do occasionally order the crispy noodle dishes which are good as well."}
{"text":"Good food, pho is only fair. Service can be very rude and I have largely boycotted it, in favor of Pho Tienh Thanh down the road."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously cheap, ridiculously tasty and remarkably consistent. 

There's a reason this place has been hyped since long before Ossington was a hipster hotspot."}
{"text":"First time I heard about this place was in a newspaper article that said even renowned chef Susur Lee dines here regularly.  So, I decided to try it out.  I love pho, and I rate them based on their broth, and their tendon.  

I've had a lot of pho before, but I've never had it better than this place.  By far, this is the BEST pho i've ever had.  Typically the pho places uptown are plagued with MSG and very \"tasty\" broth.  The broth at Golden Turtle is different.  It's tasty, and yet it's very clear - to me, that's a sign of a good broth.  It's not oily either.    They also serve one of the best tendons if you get tendon in your pho.  It's the type where it literally melts away after a while in the soup.  

Price-wise, it's decent.  A large is a good sized lunch portion, however, I also did find that the amount of noodle was a bit on the low side for a large.  I will be trying their archnemesis down the street next."}
{"text":"Not 3 stars, but 3.5 stars..... 4 stars is reserved for Pho Tien Tranh which is 2 min walk south of here.

The place is usually packed because of the glowing reviews. However I've noticed that the place is usually packed with non-asians, whereas all the hardcore Viets are seen frequenting Tien Tranh. You know what they say about asian restaurants and their customers right?

Pho broth is solid however there's something about it's taste, not sure what it is, but I can definitely differentiate it with other places. Not a bad thing, not good either.

Food:4
Service:5 (the waitresses all know me... eek)
Ambiance:3 (some weird turtle painting in the bg)
Overall: 3.5 /5 stars"}
{"text":"Great fresh food. I walk an hour from yorkville to eat here."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Pho for Toronto Downtown.  The fried springrolls are pretty traditional authentic.  Service is quick and staff are very helpful."}
{"text":"The food is great but I can't take the yelling!
It's nice to see one of the few surviving Vietnamese places on Ossington doing so well (remember that Ossington used to be a little Vietnamese community with coffee shops, video rental places, and karaoke bars that suffered from an occasional shooting).
I love that it family run and the owners have done so well that they park really nice cars outside.
The pho really is outstanding.
However, perhaps because it is family run, the owners/staff occasionally get mad at each other and yell. Unfortunately, they yell over the heads of guests, while standing beside your table, etc. You also notice that some of the staff are occasionally in a really bad mood and make no attempt to hide it from customers.
I'll do takeout, but I find visiting way too stressful!"}
{"text":"Flies + not great pho equals a bad experience. I ate here in the summer and there were many flies in my food. Three of the four people we ate with were sick the next day. Turned me off Pho for a bit."}
{"text":"I like this place because it has a lot more dishes to over versus other Vietnamese restaurants. Food wise, it's nothing special compared to other Vietnamese places. I thought this place is pretty good until one visit I notice as I was finishing up one of my dishes I found a fly in it. I told the manager and she was willing to exchange it for something else for me so I got the vermicelli with grilled pork but she gave me a small portion because she said my other dish was already finished so I'm not obligated to get the typical bowl. I found it fair I guess, but the fact that she explained to me the fly was just because of hot weather was such an excuse. Hot weather cold weather , you should not have a fly in your food regardless. I would rate it 2.5 if I could but couldn't give the 3 because that would be too generous."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love pho and the Golden Turtle has been my favourite in the city. The service has always been underwhelming but my husband and I put up with it because we liked the food. That was until last Friday.  In fact it's a bit of a joke to even mention service since that amounts to nothing more than wait staff picking up your order form, dropping a tray of food on your table and ringing you up at a cash register. So back to last Friday - while completing my order form I had a dyslexic moment and accidentally switched the placement of two numbers, rending my entry as 121 instead of 112. I did however enter in the price of #112 correctly. When the food was brought to the table one of the items was clearly not what we were expecting at which point I said to the waitress, \"we didn't order that.\"  She just grunted at us and basically threw the food on the table. So I took myself up to the counter and explained to the woman at the register that there must be some mistake; that our order was incorrect. At this point she pulls out our order form and points out that we ordered #121, some $12 item instead of our intended $5.50 spring rolls. So I tell her that I mistakenly entered the item number but point out that the price was recorded correctly. She says too bad; they go by the item number and they're going to charge us the full price for the item. I say again that it was an honest mistake and that we not only don't want #121 but also we're not going to eat it. Again she basically says \"too bad\"; they're not going to absorb the cost of our mistake because they can't serve the food to someone else. She finally says \"let's split the difference and we'll charge you $6.\" At this point I'm tired of arguing and go back to join my husband and eat our meal; minus #121 which has been removed from our table. Over the course of our meal we grow more annoyed by how the situation has been handled; one - because they're charging us for food we never ate and two - their offer to \"share\" the mistake equally was based on the item's retail price, not its cost. So when it comes time to deal with the bill my husband goes to address this with the woman at the cash register who literally loses her mind. She pulls two other employees into the discussion causing a massive scene and finally my husband relents and pays the bill. Now to be clear this isn't about $12 or $6 it's about how you treat your customers. Did I write the number incorrectly? Absolutely! Do mistakes happen? Yes. Let's consider for a moment how different this review would be if instead of responding the way in which they did, they had said \"no problem Miss! Simple mistake. We'll get those spring rolls right out.\" Instead they lost me as a customer; -and I've relayed the story to anyone who will listen and continue to do so...obviously. So there you have it. Great pho but god help you if you're a little weary on a Friday night after a long week at work and you write the number incorrectly. If I didn't know better I would have thought someone changed my name to Elaine Benes."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time and the owner was extremely RUDE. After being seated for 5 minutes he demanded that we order.  He's justification being that it was very busy.  This was 9pm on a Wednesday.  There were several empty tables and no one was waiting in line.  His badgering was absolutely ridiculous.  

We left and went to Pho Tien Thanh down the street. We're regulars there now - the staff is consistently friendly and the food is great."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan pho and vegetarian salad rolls...I'm not sure how they get the pho so tasty but I'm not asking any questions."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd overall visit to this place as I've heard Susur Lee use to come and dine here and had a pleasant experience. The place is quite packed and seats almost 50 ppl max. They don't take reservation when busy, but we got a seat pretty fast.

You can tell the restaurant makes good food when late sunday they're still full and people waiting at the doors.

My gf and I ordered their fruit shakes: Jackfruit and Durian for $3.5 each! They both were the same colour for some reason, but the taste was good. I would say that other Pho places make better shakes though and bigger cup size too.

I ordered this make your own wrap with vietnamese grilled sausage with lettuce, veggies, and wrap. Its cool, you put your paper wrap in hot water quickly and start building your own wrap for $12 large portion. You can make about 6-8 wraps! I also got their cat fish in hot pot. This is alright, with the soy sauce being quite strong. Its also $12 without rice, so not really that worth it. My gf got the vermicelli with spring roll and grilled beef, and she enjoyed it.

My bro and his gf got the Pho, and their broth is quite clear and clean. The soup taste is a lot different from Pho. We didn't feel the rush as most Yelpers has, but probably because they're closing soon, and no one else was waiting. My rating is really based on the food, but the service I don't know if its consistent.

They only accept CASH!!! But they have an ATM machine inside, but there's always a TD bank around the area. Parking is a bit difficult to find though. Happy good eating!"}
{"text":"Been to Golden Turtle 5-10 times and have always been satisfied. 

Usually I get the rare beef pho, pad Thai, and once or twice I've had the spicy lemongrass soup. 

I went 2 nights ago with 4 guys, we all got the rare beef pho and I split the veggie spring rolls with a friend. The spring rolls have become a must for me. 

8.50 for the soup is great value
6 for the 3 large spring rolls is great to share 

This is my ossington spot no question about it 
BTW everything is gluten free"}
{"text":"Kickass Pho!  Awesome broth.  Fast usual pho service with quality pho.  Kickass pancake dish.  I forget the name"}
{"text":"One word - \"quick\". This is a great place if you only have half an hour but you want something cheap, sit down, and it's not a sandwich. 

I have to say, this is not the best place to hang out with friends, it's more like order, eat and leave asap when you are done. It is not too clean although I haven't had any problem yet. I'm sure the food is fresh given their insane amount of turnover everyday.

my favourites:
1. Their rice dish with pork chop, sunny side-up friend egg
2. Their rice noodle (bun) with pork chop 
3. also, their smoothies are good too"}

{"text":"Lines for days! That's how good this place is. This is my hangover food when I can drag my body here from the heart of downtown. 

The best pho in Toronto. Not as good as their other location in Mississauga but the best pho downtown has to offer. Flavorful stocks and great meats. They have good Bun and rice dishes too!! 

Bad service. Can barely get a smile or a hello out of these people. Not typical of viet restaurant I've been too. But oh well the food makes up for the service!"}
{"text":"Good food for a reasonable price. Note cash only place.  Would definitely go back if on the area."}
{"text":"I haven't had Pho since I became a vegetarian (2006), so I love that they have a vegan option! It was a great rainy day meal - huge, filling, delicous - very comforting. The service was fast/friendly too.  I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food, generous portions, fast service. I only wish I lived closer. Make sure you get the spring rolls, they are amazing."}
{"text":"Good pho with nice balance of flavours. Good cheap price. Get number 2 (pho) or 82 (vermicelli). Fast and efficient service. Staff don't chit chat too much but are very attentive."}
{"text":"The pho is here exactly what pho should be like- aromatic, layered, not to heavy, and fresh. When it lands on your table you the whiff you get is just as appetizing as the first bite. Really, really good beef pho and summer rolls, not to mention lime-lemonade soda.

Cleanliness is good enough but the cutlery sitting at the table might have a fleck of crap on it."}
{"text":"My co - worker took me to this place , he always orders the chicken pho
Or soup as he calls it in his heavy scotch accent. I my self am partial to the beef pho and the spring rolls go hand n hand. I've yet to try the veg.

Parking can sometimes be a bitch to say the least, don't get me wrong I like the place but I've had better pho it just doesn't  rock my world"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and loved it but today when I ordered take out I was really disappointed. I didn't think I needed to ask for sauce to go with my meal... I mean who wants plain rice noodles? I get back to work and noticed they gave me no sauce for my meal or my spring rolls... Seriously?! I was irritated as I didn't have time to go back to get any, so I had to eat my meal plain and bland."}
{"text":"Contrary to what Susur Lee may think, I don't find Rua Vang Golden Turtle to be the \"best\" pho place in town. It's ok.
The hype has people queuing out the door even on a rainy day when I stopped in for a late lunch with a girlfriend.
I found the service to be slightly ruder than acceptable and I felt rushed to order. It just wasn't the best vibe.
I also found the tables and plastic chopsticks had a sticky residue on them. It was a bit of a turnoff."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Pho restaurant in Toronto that serves vegan/vegetarian dishes.  I have tried the vegan Pho at just about every Vietnames restaurant that serves said dish, and this is the most delicious.

My husband is not a vegetarian, and enjoys this restaurants as much as I do.  There are so many dishes to choose from, which are all made quickly.

My husband and I recommend this cheap, fast, and filling restarant to everyone new or visiting the city, even if they don't ask!"}
{"text":"I just love roaming this strip and finding a place to eat.

This was my second trip to the Turtle. I got one of the \"chef specialties\" - a stir friend Viet rice noodle with tofu and veggies. Also got some fried veggie spring rolls. Order was down the center of the fairway.

The noodles were fine. Slightly on the oily side. The tofu was bean curdy. The flavours weren't exceptional but the food was cheap and passable. The rolls were nice and crispy - good texture on the inside and out.

My friends got pork vermicelli and a Viet soup - both really enjoyed their dishes, though the soup eater felt quite peckish after despite the large bowl as there wasn't a lot of meat in the soup.

The patio is neighbourhoody, ramshackle, and, quite frankly, rocks.

For a cheap casual meal, not a bad place at all."}
{"text":"I almost refuse to believe that I haven't written a review for Rua Vang yet. I eat here at least a couple times a month. Not because it's the Best Pho Ever of All Time. But because it's yummy, it's near home, and it's across the street from yoga.

Not having been to Vietnam, I can't properly comment on authenticity but I can comment on yumminess and the pho here is yummy. I always get exactly the same thing (rare beef pho) - if I have a hankering for anything else it doesn't even occur to me to come here. Flavourful broth, thin slices of pink beef that cook as they float, and a smattering of sprouts and basil? Heaven.

This is the only pho place I've tried that has a patio (and on a side street, no less!), which earns extra points (and I submit that there is nothing weird about craving a steaming hot bowl of pho when it's 32 degrees outside)."}
{"text":"My all time favorite place to come to, love their food. can't complain everything is always so fresh and good..Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Nice to see some veggie options at a Vietnamese restaurant. Arrive early or expect to wait in line."}
{"text":"They're pretty legit viet food. The broth is full of flavour and depth. Their spring rolls are different, it's more chewy. I'm guessing they used glutenous rice flour or something. I really like that texture. 

If it's busy, of course they want to rush you out. That's pretty standard. This isn't big chain restaurant. I mean it's pho. You eat and go. Go loiter somewhere else. I'm used to Chinese environement which does the same thing. Same with ramen places or anything asian that's not bbt or meant to be a cafe/lounge area."}
{"text":"Having been transplanted here from Vancouver, the land of good pho. I have to agree with Susur Lee, this is the best place in Toronto for pho. Their vermicelli and rice dishes are also great. It's an inexpensive meal and you'll feel very satisfied. I guess there has been a debate between here and the other pho place down the street. I've tried it and Golden Turtle is by far the better option, there is no comparison. After a meal head across the street to the Portuguese bakery and pick up some casa tarts."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner after hearing how good it was. We ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls to share and pho.

To be honest I was shocked at how this place was known for being one of the best in Toronto for pho. The fish sauce for the spring rolls was watered down. My pho had very little pieces of beef. The broth was pretty good but overall the pho was mediocre.

The restaurant is cash only."}
{"text":"I hate this place, I hate the way the tables are set-up, (it's production like - I imagine the table tops flipping over after closing, with sewing machines appearing for the next shift, like those scenes you see in movies) I hate that there's no where to stand while you place and wait if your doing Take-out. The staff are polite enough, but give off that urgent vibe that you better know what you want! 

BUT; I love their food -  Their Pho is amazing, the spring rolls. . .  it's all amazing.

So I put up, and shut up, and devour the food LOL"}
{"text":"Susur hype or not, the fact that the proprietors have hired their teenage children to resentfully work as wait staff is the real reason you should eat here. Where else can you get a bowl of pho or bun served by a brutally bored 16 year old? He dreams of World of Warcraft while we devour our delicious beef salad rolls."}
{"text":"Golden Turtle I have to thank the owners each time that they have a vegan option for their soups-on the menu it states: VEGAN broth!! YAY!!
I have been going to the owners' restaurant since it was in a big (odd-looking) restaurant on the other side of Ossington. Their veggie menu is okay, but the flavours are great. Always great to be able to eat a full meal as a vegan in a non-vegetarian restaurant. Great pho, great vermicelli, spring rolls and cold rolls."}
{"text":"One of the best pho places in Toronto. Fast service and great tasting food! Similar menu to many Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto. I'm drooling just thinking of this place...

Except, I took a star away due to the bad service and that they don't accept credit/debit (they do have an ATM machine in the restaurant though with high fees!). The waitresses aren't always the nicest and they give you a feeling that they want you out as fast as possible, even when the restaurant is empty."}
{"text":"I have NO idea how this place has nearly 4*, it was the worst Vietnamese food I've ever had! My friend's soup was just water so she had to add a bottle of soy sauce to it. My food was literally boiled rice and some crunchy vegetables, with only just cooked enough shrimp. The wine was definitely watered down and the service was shocking. The grumpiest waiter, I grudgingly tipped. Urghhhh the thought of that meal now is making me feel a little ill! Don't goooooo here!"}
{"text":"First and last time here. Utmost deplorable service!!! Waitress was down right rude. Food was nothing special. Never again."}
{"text":"this is my second time coming back. i can't remember much about the first time except it was cramped inside. this time we sat on the patio because my friend brought his dog. *note to dog owners: your dog is welcome since they have a patio!* however, the patio is also next to the trash from the neighboring building. much to my pleasant surprise it didn't smell.

this place is similar to other pho places that it's small and not the cleanest of places, but that's how pho places are. the surprise was the restroom, which was quite clean! 

i got bun (vermicelli) with a fried spring roll and beef wrapped in herbs. the spring roll was the worst spring roll i ever had in my life. it looked really ODD and tasted like a bad egg roll from a chinese fast food joint. the bun and veggies were fine and normal. the beef wrapped in herbs was fine too. 

i also got the banh xeo (this egg crepe with bean sprouts, a bit of pork and shrimp inside). it was really good! crispy the way i like it. i recommend it. 

so would i come back? yah, i'll just order something else as my entree. my friends' dinners looked more appetizing and they got rice and soup noodles."}
{"text":"In the handful of times I've ventured here, I've only ordered the pho and cold rolls -  both are delish. I've tried the rare beef pho, chicken pho, spicy vegetable and tofu pho...all amazing. I'm #175's biggest fan! Go, it's cheap and quick...can't really go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Worst Vietnamese food I've ever had in Toronto. How this business survive is beyond me. The staff isn't very friendly to begin with. The grumpy lady has this impatient you-are-an-annoyance-in-my-life look on her face when I asked to place my order. (If she doesn't enjoy running a restaurant, then shut down the business. I care about her happiness. ) And I'm wasting time to whine about it on Yelp. I felt stupid to walk into this joint when I saw it half empty. I only walked in because I was hungry and the other Vietnamese Pho restaurant down the street has a long line. Next time, I'd rather staved to death waiting on the line than walking into this one."}
{"text":"So after reading about Golden Turtle I finally dragged my husband there last night and... it was just okay.  I had a large pho with everything in it (#14) and my husband got a vermicelli bowl with grilled beef, spring roll and shredded pork (#96).  My pho was okay however broth was quite mild and flavourless, I have heard this restaurant doesn't use MSG so maybe that's why but it was not that good.  The rare beef came out pretty much cooked already and the pieces of beef just weren't fatty enough to be tender, they were tough and there was suppose to be tendon and there wasn't any.  My husbands vermicelli bowl was better than my pho; the spring roll was amazing and the grilled beef was pretty good too but the shredded pork was not to my taste.  Overall I give this place a 3 and next time I'll trek over to Gerrard East for my pho fix."}
{"text":"Been here twice. The broth is very flavourful and the noodles were not overcooked. Decent portions that is on par with other Pho restaurants. Waiting staff were very friendly and the restaurant was CLEAN.

Hua spicy noodle soup - 3.5/5 (could have been spicier...was a bit greasy) 
Vermicelli noodles with pork and eggrolls - 4/5 (pork was very tender and nicely grilled, enjoyed the egg roll, generous portion)
Avocado shake - 3.5/5 (nothing special but seemed like there was too much condensed milk...was too sweet!)
Durian shake - 3.5 (they used real durian but same comment as above, seemed like there was too much condensed milk)"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's quick, inexpensive, and tasty.  They have always been friendly and the service is great.  
It's in my near to me so that's even better - it's a great place to go for a quick bite and to leave satisfied - my food always arrives piping hot and tastes fresh and the owners are always lovely."}
{"text":"I have to question the palate of those who like Golden Turtle better than Tien Thanh, because Golden Turtle pho was less than average for me.  The broth was bland and the meat in it was tough.  They also don't have sawtooth herb and I had to request the bird's eye chilis.  I've read reviews claiming that the fried spring rolls at Golden Turtle are amazing.  They are amazingly oily and bland.  I hated them.  All I could taste was old oil.  The sauce was also very bland.  They were bigger than the ones at Tien Thanh...for me this was a negative, since I thought they were really bad and almost inedible.  On the plus side for Golden Turtle: their interior is nice, they have a patio, and the water jugs and glasses they served us were very clean and looked brand new.  Had no problem with service. 

But if you're in the area for pho, I suggest you walk 2 minutes south to Pho Tien Thanh.  Their pho and fried spring rolls are amazing.  And if it matters to you, I've seen Susur Lee eating at Tien Thanh myself."}
{"text":"Get the Vietnamese pancake under the appetizer section.  It's so freakin' awesome!!!!! It's like an egg crepe with some coconut milk mixed in, studded with shrimp, fried until crispy, and then stuffed with bean sprouts.  Served with fresh green lettuce, pickled radish and carrots, and some basil, you basically make a spring roll out of it and then shove it down your gullet with your hands.  DELISH!!!!

Pho otherwise is about the same as the others-soup is nice and clear, less greasy and much more clean tasting than other Pho places.  

But it's the pancake that draws us back again and again with it's crispy exterior and melt in your mouth soft interior.  At $7.99, it's an affordable addiction, though the side effects include belly bloat and sleepiness."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Pho here.  I'm a big fan of Pho in general, so this was dee lish.  I thought that the place itself was a bit too jam-packed for my liking.  You're practically elbow to elbow with the other patrons when it's busy...and it usually is."}
{"text":"This is a \"Vegetarian pho\" biased review. 

Golden Turtle gets 4 stars because my SO (pho eater) and I (not pho eater) can both agree on the quality. We like it. It also gets bonus points for having real vegetarian pho. Often (especially in winter) I am left watching him slurp down a warm and yummy bowl of hot noodle soup while I crunch on some lettuce and cold vermicelli. I need soup options too. 

And unlike the lemongrass/sweet and sour vegetarian pho found at Ginger (Good!) http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ginger-toronto-4#hrid:d4WE-yvc2CoB_k3gvrsd8A and Hanoi 3 Seasons (Not as Good)  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hanoi-3-seasons-toronto#hrid:O-TCupsyMu8daMSilT8sAg it has a different style of broth. 

Often Veggie Pho comes with less noodles. Do they think we are lighter eaters? Shouldn't we get more noodles for compensation? Regardless, Golden Turtle Gives enough veggies that they don't feel like an afterthought. 

Bun is decent here, but the shrimp paste is no Mi Mis. http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mi-mi-restaurant-toronto#hrid:wbVI3rHpdGbkUqzrCp41tw. There is a patio if you want  to eat pho outside. Busy place, plan ahead and don't come during peak hours."}
{"text":"Time to review Golden Turtle.  I used to visit this place more often years ago, but I've notice decline in quality over the years.  Not sure if it's due to change of ownership or what.  As far as pho goes, I'd definitely prefer their neighbour Tien Thanh, and the impression didn't change during my recent visit.  Pho here is really basic and average, and they don't use banh pho like my favour place does.  The broth is basic and average, and I find the meat tastes kinda off for me.  They also seem to skimp on the complementary bean sprout they gave out.  The items they used to do really well are pho Sate and spring roll, but the taste has been underwhelming the last couple of times I ordered them.  Overall I'd say the only area I'll choose this over Tien Thanh is they offer more variety of Vietnamese dishes than Tien Thanh.

Service is efficient but not friendly.  Overall 2.5/5"}
{"text":"This is one of the few pho places I can go to with my veggie boyfriend because the broth is authentically a veggie broth (not chicken) and it so very tasty.

The veggie pho is especially full of delicious tofu puffs.

I usually get the spicy beef pho listed on the Chef's special page. 

Love Golden Turtle and always come back."}
{"text":"The food is good but the customer service isn't.

Unfortunately had to treck up a few blocks to grab cash since the atm was out of order. 

The cash only thing is a drag when your competition has comparable quality with better prices, and I don't have to pay the bank fees if I miss the small cash only sign at the door.

Also got asked 3 or 4 times in 15min whether I was done eating... 

Bring cash and go on off times, and it's probably not a bad little place."}
{"text":"Tried the Mi Quang based on a recommendation and I still like pho more.  The pho here is better than those other late night pho spots, but I still believe that PTT, just south of Golden Turtle, is slightly better (read my other review).  Their broths are pretty good - when I drink some of it it doesn't taste overly MSG-like."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place so I finally made the journey out to Ossington to try it out. I'm so glad it took back the #1 pho spot in Toronto, because Pho Hung was #1 for so long and it really didn't deserve to be. The pho here comes with lots of noodles which I love. The beef cuts are okay, they use the type of beef ball that I'm not the biggest fan of (chunky rather than smooth) but the star here is definitely their tendon-- SO delicious and melt in your mouth. I think the broth was a bit too salty and didn't have a deep enough flavour-- some people may like the lighter flavour but I prefer my pho broth heavy and full of flavour. 
The service was great for a pho restaurant, there was a lot of staff around (we were seated near the kitchen) who I think may have been family members called in to help out due to the restaurants recent exploding popularity. 
The menu was a bit unorganized in my opinion, and I'm disappointed they only offer pork or veggie spring rolls - not chicken.
This place is cash only but they have an ATM in the restaurant-- usually I have the cash on me but I didn't this time which is more my fault than the restaurant's.
I like the restaurant's aesthetics, dinnerware and how they bring you your own picture of water. Plus the big squeeze tube of the garlic chili sauce is a definite plus (way better than Sriracha which they also have) because most places just have it in a tiny tub that you have to scoop out with a spoon. 
Overall- a solid pho spot. Worth the journey out? Maybe."}
{"text":"Can't speak of the Pho because I didn't order it. 

But the bun vermicelli with bbq grilled chicken and spring roll, was divine. 

I really questioned my friends choice of going here. C'mon Vietnamese on Ossington?  Ok guys, I won't be difficult and go along. 

But as I approached after parking the car I saw people racing in here like you wouldn't believe. As you step inside. All you see are tables and people eating. There's no space anywhere!  It's a very popular neighbourhood spot. 

Service though is all business and a bit cold. After we were done eating, they cleared the table and dropped the bill on table even before we asked. (the signal to get the heck out sort of deal) we need your spot for another paying customer.   

But you know what, the food was splendid. 

My dish was fresh and prepared well, the bean sprouts, herbs, vermicelli, bbq chicken was marinated and grilled well sprinkled with chopped peanuts, the spring rolls tasted perfect. I can't fault it. It was probably the best bun vermicelli I remember having for a long time! 

Also noticed they offer some different choices, like herbed beef vermicelli, thinly sliced beef rolled in some herb leaf (looks like a cigar) and some pineapple  dishes. 

So strangely I'd be back to hit up this spot if I'm in Ossington again.

note: they only accept cash"}
{"text":"The Pho was delicious , the service was a little bit strange... you have to write down your order by yourself."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best pho in Toronto - here it is. I always order the spicy seafood pho since I'm a sucker for those delicious fish balls. The beef fresh rolls are especially great and super flavourful. Their spring rolls are among the best I've ever had, though a little on the greasy side. You also can't go wrong with any of the vermincelli noodle dishes. 

Service and food is always delicious and consistent. A staple on the Ossington strip!"}
{"text":"honestly.. enough with this hype..

the broth's key feature is it is MSG Free.. however it is absolutely bland ... i can't believe this place still has clients that enjoy that big bowl of hot water essentially..

the sizes are not the greatest, and inconsistent and the meat.. LOL.. lets not even talk about it

Honestly I only ate here because MSG gives me headaches but im done with this place.."}
{"text":"The only reason that I come back here is because the food is pretty darn good for the price paid.  I always get the grilled pork vermicelli with spring roll.  It's really good.  That said, I only eat here about once a year.

I have no reason to come back more often.  They only accept cash, which is annoying for a restaurant.  And there is one particular server who is atrocious.  I can easily say that it is the worst service that I have EVER received in Toronto.  

She is an older Asian woman with short hair... perhaps one of the owners?  Today, and for the second time, she droppped the bill down on the table mid-way through our meal.  The first time that we were served by her (last year), she dropped the bill down and about 5-10 minutes later, literally asked us to pay and leave because she wanted to accommodate the ppl waiting at the door.  Fair enough, but there are more pleasant ways of urging customers to finish up.

I realize that it is a quick-turnaround restaurant, but if they really want quick-operations, they should make it a pure takeout restaurant instead of asking ppl to leave.

Perhaps the other servers are better, but this woman is miserable and atrocious and is the only reason that I refuse to eat here more than once a year.

You can get pretty good Viet-food elsewhere without the aggressive attitude, IMO.  Go to Pho Tien Thanh just down the street.  The owners at Pho Tien Thanh are so genuinely nice and the food is actually better than Golden Turtle."}
{"text":"Big menu from 1-180 listed items as you'd see at most viet pho places...

Patio is a big selling point- lovely to have some pho out in the sun.

Spring rolls were really quite tasty- so get a plate that comes with one of those if you can...

My friend had the pad-thai. He hated it. So I'll take off one pat for that. Who orders pad thai these days? am I right, ladies?? frig. 1400 calories. 
AND another one for not accepting visa.

three outtta five fuckin pats

{"text":"GENERAL NOTES
This place is busy! And small. And the seating is awkward. In other words, it has all the elements of a great pho place. I went here on the recommendation of a non-Yelp friend (what do they know) and was glad I did. The menu is what you'd expect and the price is right. Now let's have some pho.

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
Rare beef pho - just do it. The large is an enormous bowl of green onions, sprouts, mint (right?) and wonderfully thin beef. I found the broth to be far less salty than most pho places, almost to the point of wanting it to be more salty. Luckily, there was lots of salty things on the table that could be added. 

The fresh rolls were good as was the vermicelli dish I had. I'm going to go out on a limb and say you can't go wrong here but unless you're definitely feeling like something other than pho, get the pho.

LOCATION NOTES
East side of Ossington between Queen and Dundas. 

SERVICE NOTES
This was the annoying part. They moved us after serving us tea but didn't move our tea cups for us. Meh, we got over it. 

HUMOUROUS STORY
Picture an Asian lady with a thick accent singing Oh Darling by the Beatles. It didn't happen or anything, just picture it. 

Oh Dalring
Prease bereive me...

Anyway...funny to me."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at this place, honestly it's not that great. Had pho & we ordered pad Thai with veggie spring rolls .. Oh and a avocado milk shake. The food was very greasy !!! And serving was not that much for such prices. We had to use our napkins to soak the oil. The soup was ok. We have had a lot better Vietnamese food. We won't come back here..."}
{"text":"This place is alright, it's small and dirty as are other Viet places. Nothing special, but still better than most places in the city. If you're looking for something decent priced and are in the area this would be it, but I don't suggest driving far for this place."}
{"text":"Was taken here last night for a first date, and although not the most romantic venue in the world, our dinner was delicious! I had the rare beef and it was delicious, spicy and delicious, noodles were well cooked.  Pho portions always blow my mind and somewhat small tummy away. I finished maybe a third there, just ate some for lunch, and I'll prob finish it off for dinner. At about 8.50 pp, that's a pretty stellar deal.
NB, Cash only."}
{"text":"Rua Vang overcomes significant ergonomic and aesthetic challenges to rise well above the din the comprises Vietnamese cuisine in the GTA.  

Let's ignore the accolade tossing - best in the city, best in the GTA, best in North America - because when it comes to Pho it just seems to make people defensive.  

I've consumed the noodle soup of dreams all around the world; throughout N. America, Europe, Asia, and yes, even a little out of the way spot know as VIET NAM.  The GT serves a credible, tasty version - usually.  The problem they run into is one of consistency...they are subject to lapses.  I've been served some world class broth on one event only to return a few weeks later to some stuff that I am pretty convinced originated from a cube - yep, we're talking straight up Phullion (pho + bullion for the slower set) here people!

People; This place is NOT just about Pho.  They do serve a pretty comprehensive menu and when I've gone deeper into their rotation I've actually always been pleasantly surprised.  

The recent remodel is kind of amusing insofar as it seems as though the dial on the time machine got stuck in the mid-80s with a distinct Patrick Nagel vibe going on - think Vietnamese restaurant Los Angeles circa 1985 and you've got the picture.  

Worth a go, but don't let the hype fuel your expectations."}
{"text":"Was SO excited to try the vegan pho here. Turns out it was basically just some low quality broccoli, bok choy, carrots and  spongy tofu in hot, salty water. Not the place to go for quality vegetarian food."}
{"text":"While I know several people in the area that do say they like the Golden Turtle as a go to for pho, my last few experiences have been less than stellar and I don't appreciate their lack of service.

The standard rare beef pho is ok.
I tried a few other noodle dishes, the pad thai and the singapore noodles - both extremely greasy, poorly cut array of vegetables.

The staff never smile and serve you with a complete indifference. Not a word was spoken in the last three visits. Maybe they don't speak English, but I don't think it's too much to ask that they do now that they're here and are running a business in the community.

No receipts and cash only makes me question how much they actually contribute to the tax base of the community.

If the food was really good, I might overlook the culture difference in hospitality but I just feel the overall experience there is greasy.

We're lucky to have so many Pho options in Toronto and in the Beaconsfield/Brockfield Village - and given that there is really no need to go here."}
{"text":"Enough about Susur Lee - I love the legend too, but I've seen Mark McEwen at the Home Depot in Leaside chowing down on Harvey's burgers (and twice too!), doesn't make it the best burger joint in town.  And besides I have seen Susur in a Pho joint and it wasn't here - it was down the street at the Golden Turtle's archnemesis Tuan Vo's soup kitchen - yes that other one that only has a Vietnamese name - Pho Tien Thanh.

On to the important stuff - I've been back and forth between the two restaurants since when these places were surrounded by Vietnamese gangster karaoke bars, and the current hipster quotient is exceedingly annoying. Tons of Vietnamese don't even want to come here anymore and eat  with Kevin Drew wannabes.  But they do flock back, cuz it's that good - unfortunately it's not the pho that's good here.  It's everything else.

The pho soup here is hit and miss, but generally quite bland and tasteless.  Points however, are given for not killing it with bad artificial stock and MSG, like all of the bad Chinatown ones do.  At least, you know you're a getting soup you wouldn't hesitate to drink.  But it's all about the soup, and they more often than not get it wrong.  Gripe about the rare beef slices too, they seem to be very tough all the time and come really cooked by the time they're served, definitely a no-no in my books.  Oh and the small bowl of pho literally left my 4 year old cousin asking for more food.

I think any of the bun (vermicelli) items are really amazing, sometimes not sure I'm eating a salad or having a bowl of noodles (in a good way) - no better light meal on a summer afternoon.  Generally be adventurous and try all the other things on the menu - they have a lot of items not available at other Vietnamese restaurants, really refreshing to see, given most people think Vietnamese people only eat variations of about 4 dishes.

For pho - gotta head to Tien Thanh.  For everything else, Mr. Nguyen does it right."}
{"text":"Food: 9/10
Atmosphere: 7.5/10 
Service: 7.5/10
Overall experience: 8/10

If you're looking for good pho in the city of Toronto, you've come to the right place.

Though atmosphere and service get lower than average ratings, let's be serious. We don't go to Asian restaurants for those things. We go for the food and the food here is great. (Side note though: the service is fine and the atmosphere is cleaner than you would find in Chinatown. Bonus points!)

The pho here is really good. The broth comes out very hot. They don't over or undercook the \"raw\" beef that they put in it. Good amount of tripe and beef balls. 

I've also had the deep fried spring rolls - really really great. 

I've also heard...psst..it's Susur Lee's favourite pho place.

The bottom line: fantastic Vietnamese staples in your usual Asian setting."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pho place in the city but the 4th star may have been influenced by its proximity to my house, my familiarity with the staff (sometimes I don't even have to order) and the potential to see George Strombolopoulous in his corner table.

I alternate between the \"Special 171\" (spicy beef) and regular beef pho. Love the spring rolls as well - my favourite spring rolls in the city.

While I've had better quality broth and beef other places, I have also had waaaaaay worse attempts at pho. This place has great service if by great service you mean fast and not polite. The staff will barely speak to you, but if my food comes quickly I'm not that fussed. 

I used to be embarrassed to bring my fancy (read: snobby or people not used to the dives in the neighbourhood) friends here but with the recent renos I'll be bringing more of my out of town guests here. 

My friends rave about the vegan broth as well, so I deem this place veggie-friendly. 

After reading other Yelp reviews and Foursquare tips, I've got an excuse to go back soon - vietnamese pancakes?! See you soon, Turtle!"}
{"text":"5 stars for Pho, 3 stars for everything else. 
If you already have a fave Vietnamese place, don't stray too far off the Pho menu here, because it can be a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"the only pho joint that matters in toronto. they need an east end location so badly."}
{"text":"Unspectacular but not inedible. Not enough sliced beef in the rare beef and beef balls soup. Here's to 4 hunks of halved meatballs and 3 pieces of sliced beef floating in diluted broth. Unimpressed with portions. If you can hold out Id go to xe lua or pho Pasteur in Chinatown"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Pho I have tried yet in this area! The service is extremely fast.

We come in at least once per week."}
{"text":"Great & inexpensive pho and a friendly, bright and clean atmosphere make Golden Turtle one of the better options in this area of town.  Broth is fresh, just enough ingredients to fill you up and prices that cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Across from the street from the Bellwoods Brewery, it's conveniently located for when you need to get your pho fix on.  

When you walk in, you are greeted by the chatter in Vietnamese at the back.  Quickly seated, I ordered my usual go to, the pho with everything.  The ingredients in the pho are carefully arranged, and everything has a freshly made and clean feeling to it.  The bean sprouts, basil, and lime are noticeably fresher than usual, and the slices of beef are plentiful.  The standard drink is a glass of water, but if you want a pot of tea, be sure to ask for that instead.

The décor is much cleaner and spacious than most places, and has a less hurried feel.  Here you can take your time to peruse the much bigger than usual menu.  It's the kind of place where you can come many times and still not try out the whole menu."}
{"text":"If this is what you want, you will love Golden Turtle. Which is to say, if you want a classy establishment where you can propose to your girlfriend, keep looking. But if you're after a delicious, quick, cheap and generally enjoyable meal - this is where it's at. Any pho will do, although I particularly enjoy the chicken. And the springrolls are so good that I've been there with people who skip the main and just chow down on a platter of them for dinner (shortly before suffering massive coronaries).

Also great for take out, just beware the line ups on the weekend - especially Sunday night before trivia down at The Ossington"}
{"text":"Every time my friends want to come here, I cringe. I really hate coming to this place, but I do to hang out. 

Intro. The place looks dirty. It reminds me of certain old establishments in Hong Kong, you know, where wait staff dress in flip flops and stained white t-shirts, where furniture are mismatched, and where noodles are cut with that one longer-than-usual fingernail (the thumbnail). OKAY! I am being a tad bit dramatic, but you get the idea? 

Food. The menu is extensive, and they have all the regular fanfare of Vietnamese food (Pho, Vermicelli wraps, rice + vegetables/meat, congee and noodles). I tried the Beef Ball pho one time and it was average, nothing special except to say it will satisfy a quick Pho Fix. The last time I came here, I didn't feel like having any main dish, so I ordered the \"fresh\" spring roll wraps (non-fried) in vegetable and shrimp. The vegetable wraps were fine but the shrimp wraps were absolutely disgusting. I had one bite and it took all my being to stop my gag reflex - the shrimp was not fresh and it tasted grainy (eeww). Now, it was late Friday night and the kitchen was closing, so not smart on my part to order Shrimp, but I thought it would be harmless. WRONG! 

FYI - Do not order anything exotic at this place. If you must, just stick to plain Pho noodles in soup. Do not take the chance. 

Service. None. Funnily enough, the best server here is the older guy who thanks you for coming to eat... every time I come here he is always outside smoking at the patio. 

Price. CHEAP. Sorry but that doesn't cut it. A small bowl of pho is around $5, but I have been to other Vietnamese restaurants where the prices are equivalent if not slightly higher. Which means, at the end of the day, you are not saving much."}
{"text":"first time eating Pho downtown and let me telling you it was the perfect day because it was SO COLD!

it was between this spot and the other Pho place on Ossington. We opted for this one as the pictures on Yelp looked better.

there was a huge line up to get in and it was first come first serve. what i wished they had done was explicitly state outside that their ATM wasn't working and that they are cash only. I got to the front of the line waiting to be seated and was then informed about it (minor annoyance & luckily my friend had cash).

The food was so filling, and delicious! I had the chicken pho and my friend had the beef pho!

definitely a location and dish i would have again, only advice - don't wear your everyday jacket... it smell lingers for a few days!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price, fast service.  This is the perfect place to go to when you want a quick meal.  The broth used in the pho is really aromatic and delicious.  It's a busy place but I always manage to get a seat.  The staff is friendly and it's in a convenient location.  I go here often and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once for there famous pho, which is great, but not spectacular enough for me to go out of the way for it, and once for their bun rieu. Those who know me know I've never had into a bowl of bun rieu I did not enjoy, but this was the one exception. 

Whoever added salt to the broth that day must have accidentally poured the entire box in, and tried to cover it up by watering it down. The tofu puffs in the bun rieu were semi cold, and the spring rolls that arrived at the table literally 20 seconds after we placed the order were also semi cold.  

My hungover, dehydrated, and over-salted self kept waiting for my coconut water to arrive. When I had no choice but to follow up on my order after I had drank all the water from the bottle that they leave on the table, I find out that they completely missed my drink order.. 

Overall - not impressed. I will be going down the street to Pho Tien Thanh next time I'm in the area and craving some bun rieu."}
{"text":"Was in the area and always heard this is the best pho and saw all the Now Toronto best of winning posters in the restaurant.  It was good but not oh my god amazing pho.  It was clean inside which is a plus.  Spring rolls weren't great.  Pho was good and soup was good I wasn't dying of thirst after like at other places.  Costs more than typical pho too."}
{"text":"Ossignton Ave has many great places to eat and I had high expectation for Golden Turtle but it turns out it is just A-OK. It was a rainy day as I entered the Golden Turtle and the hostess sat my party down and before i sat down an employee told me to put my umbrella in the bucket by the door. Making me walk again around the restaurant as I was about to sit down. ugh. Guess they want to keep their floors dry as possible. Not a good first impression.

The menu had a lot of items but I selected the pho (14) and a Fresh salad roll with grilled herb-wrapped beef (115). The food came very, very, very quickly. Faster than fast food chains. The salad roll came out in like a minute after ordering and when I was eating a roll, the pho came out very quickly. The beef roll was ok. It seemed like they took it out of a fridge pre-made and served it. I thought the size of the pho was not as big compared to other pho places. The broth was the highlight of the meal as it was not too oily and had great aroma. However, the noodles and beef were not that great in texture and flavour. It was still A-OK pho though.

CASH ONLY. I know...like who carries cash around nowadays? Of course, conveniently, they have an ATM machine inside the restaurant. Weird eh? 

The interior is nicer than other pho places. Clean and has a ok feel to it. Service was another part where Golden Turtle fell flat. Servers do not give out a friendly vibe at all.

Overall, Golden Turtle struck out on the service for my first visit."}
{"text":"Golden Turtle is a place I try to visit at least once a week. I crave it all the time and constantly annoy my friends to accompany me there. The food is unbelievable. Pho is savory and rich. The vermicelli bowls are always fresh and delicious. Rice dishes are also incredible and the salad rolls are to die for.
The decor has changed in the last year, and there are some pretty interesting murals going on...including one that features a giant turtle. It's very bizarre...
Sometimes there is a wait, especially during the dinner rush.
The service is ok, food comes out very fast and all the servers are very matter-of-fact, which doesn't bother me at all.
I would recommend this place to anyone without reservations. Best Vietnamese food in the city."}
{"text":"A real Toronto staple! Great location on the ever so happening Ossington Ave, very extensive menu (the best pho I've ever had), fast service, very reasonable prices... Recently renovated, clean bathrooms (always a good sign!). The one thing to remember is that they only accept cash (there is an ATM in the restaurant but the convenience comes with a charge, of course). Definitely five stars!"}
{"text":"This rating is based on their pho. I haven't tried other dishes and I don't think I would after this experience. There are so many better pho places downtown, Markham or Scarborough.

The soup is very important in pho. Whenever I get a bowl.. The first thing I do is have a spoonful of the bowl. Before even putting anything inside it. One taste of the soup and the taste of MSG is just an explosion in your mouth. The herb and meat aromas of traditional pho is lost. The sweetness? That's the msg. The thirstiness you have after? That's the MSG. It seemingly taste delicious because of the chicken powder and msg put inside it. It does has subtle hints of meat. Does not really taste authentic. Even the meat was disappointing. Yeah there was meat inside it, but it tasted thrown together. It appears like a good bowl of hearty pho.. But the soup is so important.. So I'm kind of disappointed. 

Service.. Its alright. Like any other Asian restaurant. The younger servers seem to try a bit more, the other ones don't bother to serve you and just throw things onto the table."}
{"text":"I am growing extremely tired of hearing \"Golden Turtle\" and \"best pho in the city\" together in the same sentence. The pho @ GT is good, but not excellent, nor is it near the best in the city.

After coming across an article this morning whereby Seamus O'Regan claimed GT was the best in the city and that he had eaten pho in Vietnam, I decided to give GT another chance after a couple subpar experiences. Overall my bowl with rare beef and well done flank was OK and nothing more. I like how it arrived approximately 120 seconds after I had placed the order, but there was nothing else to remember.

For me the #1 trait a bowl should be judged on is the broth above evrerything else, unfortunately GT's is seriously lacking that kick, punch and jab that a solid bowl should have. The portions are good and the service is prompt, but it is not the best pho in the city.

Pho Tien Thanh down the road has my vote as the best in the city and once you try the broth there you won't eat pho anywhere else. I've eaten pho all over Toronto, Richmond Hill, Markham, Mississauga and Waterloo and PTT's broth is boss. It's clear, succulent, spiced just right and gives me weekly withdrawl. In fact, I know where I'm going for dinner."}
{"text":"People love this no nonsense meal, any day of the week, any time of the day, but especially in the wee hours of the dark. If that's the case, then any restaurant on Spadina will do.


Then there are days when you want better. A little more flavour, a little less grime.


Enter Golden Turtle - long heralded as the home of Toronto's most famous, and many argue the best, Vietnamese beef noodle soup. It's the best no frills pho po me."}
{"text":"Great pho and other Vietnamese options for a very affordable price. For a pleasant surprise, try the avacado smoothie."}
{"text":"The staff here are quick and efficient. Really nice. 

I got pho with extra vegetables. The broth here is amazing! We just got waters with our soup (no tea).

The avocado shake here is also great. Just the right amount of sweetness. 

This place is cash only, but they have an ATM inside by the window."}
{"text":"A date took me here on a Monday and I went back on a Wednesday (only because they aren't open on Tuesdays). 

Cheap, fresh, filling, fun. This is a very unique place and I can understand why some people have rated it poorly. They certainly aren't in it for the customer service but the food speaks volumes. And quite frankly I like that they don't bombard you, if you need them you can just flag them down. They give you a menu with about 6 pages filled front and back with options. Also, they'll hand you a pencil and piece of paper that you fill out, placing your order. The food comes out in a matter of minutes so quickly in fact I was pleasantly shocked. Both times I ordered the same thing, 91. Spicy satay shrimp and lemon grass with vermicelli. Just Amazing. I dont even know what to say you just need to order it. The fried spring rolls.... probably the best I've ever had. Also, domestic beer for $4 and $4.75 for imported.... honestly how could you go wrong? It's a place where you don't as questions, your game plan should be narrowing down your options and take a chance, live a little!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible pho... but even worst service! ! I was actually astonished as each family member berated me; one after another, defending their tendon,  which was actually a bone connected to brisket.  The tendon bits resembled hard white plastic with fragments of bone. A fellow with very slouchey shoulders rolled his eyes and called over the manager. While I waited an elderly women who did not speak English yelled at me for a minute or so before vanishing back to the kitchen. When the manager arrived she said she only makes 50 cents on a bowl of  pho and many patrons have complained they did not want their poor tasting pho. She than threaten to call an \"officier\" if i did not pay.  I was taken a back since my only complaint was that i thought they had given me the wrong order ( rare beef and brisket instead or rare beef and tendon).  Eventually a new bowl of rare beef pho was served as a replacement. Some how the rare  beef in this bowl was very tough,  like eating a piece of leather.  However,  the noodles were cooked well.  Bad pho and horrible service; go to the place a block south; it's one of the best in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Found a grey hair in my soup that was stuck in a broccoli. Very rude and unapologetic waitress. Do not come here. Food isn't even that great."}
{"text":"It's clean. It doesn't smell. Everything is presented well. But maybe pho places really need to be hole in the walls to b authentically good? The spring rolls were really good but the pho broth was lacking something. If I'm back to Ossington I'll go to the neighbouring joint. Even if it smells..."}
{"text":"This place is consistently busy.  We keep coming back because the soups are not laden with MSG.  The broth is not as flavourful as I would like it, though.  The portions and prices are reasonable for downtown pho and bun.  It's also seemingly cleaner than other Vietnamese restaurants.  The renos sure made a big difference."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'd say best pho in Toronto. I've been going here for years. I always get pho, #112 spring rolls and #74."}
{"text":"the food is delicious but the place is so dirty. The table and the condiment bottles are always sticky. Honestly, the food is tasty but I just can't get over how I don't want to touch anything and I just feel dirty and squeamish here due to their unsanitary conditions. will go there in a pinch but I prefer pho phuong because they seem much cleaner and theyre just as tasty."}
{"text":"Everyone who talks about Pho seems to love this place. I don't see what all the fuss is about. The Pho here is nothing but a watery bowl with a few noodles and stems of green leaves. Had to use so much hot sauce to create any flavour in this soup. It's always crammed but I'd never wait for a table here."}
{"text":"Golden Turtle reigned supreme as the best Pho place in Toronto for many years. Their broth is definitely one of the best but their success has gotten to the heads of this family run business. They are ALWAYS super busy as well which means they no longer have to work hard. Their service is not only poor, but they are regularly rude to customers. The service size of meat in their Pho has slowly gone down over the years as well. If you love Pho, you'll still do great at this place but there are other new and old Pho restaurants that you will slowly see beating out Golden Turtle on the top rankings as years go by in my opinion.

Lastly, they only accept cash which can be a real pain if you aren't prepared and of course they have their own cash machine in the place which will rob you of $3 per transaction!"}
{"text":"I wish teleporting existed.

Because if it did, I'd request it to please take me back to Toronto. I could literally spend the day eating & drinking & shopping my way up and down the Ossington strip.

(Pho) Rua Vang / Golden Turtle came highly recommended and I will now highly recommend it to everyone I know who's making a trip to Toronto. It was a hot summer day and we arrived slightly after the regular lunch rush and it was still relatively busy. We opted to wait for a seat for the patio because the inside seating area was unbearably humid.

I knew I would be ordering the BBH but I browsed through the menu anyway and there were so many dishes I wanted to try! I looked around at the other tables and everyone seemed so happy eating their meals so I knew I was in for a treat. My eating partner was a vegetarian and so guess what? They had a vegetarian BBH! I was so surprised! And you know what was even more shocking? The veggie BBH actually tasted pretty damn good! I wish I took a photo of it because it looked amazing as well. As I've mentioned before, I'm not a vegetarian but I love knowing that I have that option. My regular BBH was just as delicious. The soup was piping hot and so flavourful.

There's something pleasantly wonderful about eating a delicious bowl of Pho on a patio. Is there a Pho joint in Vancouver with a patio?? I'd like to know!"}
{"text":"We eat a lot of pho. It's basically our go to for everything. Don't know how it happened, but that comforting soup noodle, with the intense beefy flavour is something that I just can't enough of sometimes. For me, it's actually all about the texture of the rice noodle and complexity in flavour of the broth. I don't even have to have the protein that is ubiquitous with the dish.

In this context, Golden Turtle has hit all the standard notes for pho. It doesn't stand out, though it does rank in the top half for me.

The deep fried spring roll was very well done as well. A bit too oily, but I guess that's where a lot of the deliciousness came from.

The patio - rare for a pho place though not out of the ordinary for this neighbourhood - was packed. The service was quick. All in all, for a cheaper for fix in this neighbourhood, I would come again."}
{"text":"I just ate there...
I heard reviews about this place and I wanted to check it out for myself.
I don't know why this place gets such a high rating because everything about it was so average or bad apart from the location. I don't know what the name of the place is on College and landsdown but the Pho is 10X better. 

also the SERVICE is HORRIBLE, I felt like the girl who served me would rather be dead. food, water and bill was literally just thrown onto the table without saying a word. They just wanted you to eat and get out of there. This could be some of the WORST service I ever had. Why bother giving them my hard earned money.

I will say that one of the male workers wished me a goodnight when I left, so they get one star for that. Not going back."}
{"text":"I was anticipating a positive strong impression based on the reviews written across the board about Pho Rua Vang. So I decided to go it alone tonite. It was friday nite around 7.45pm and the place was busy af with about 10 peeps waiting by the door to get it. Boy, was I disappointed. Once I was seated (after a 15 min wait) the customer service pissed me off upfront from the get go... First, I was disappointed when they brought some plastic flask of water that was neither hot or cold. That got me off on the negative side right away... that this wasnt even an authentic viet joint. You could not ask for cold nor hot tea which sucks. The wait staff was rude, crass, and terse and the door guy (manager) was stupid af.... I asked him why there wasnt a bottle of pepper as part of the condiments. This is a staple in every freakin viet eaterie in TO, HK, and vietnam. How retarded. You can tell this joint is for white people. The door manager who was some CBC (cdn born chinese or viet) pretended not to know what the hell I as asking for. I said pepper 4-5 times. He kept going \"...what, what, what... what is pepper??\" Are you a freakin moron??  Then a little viet waitress trolls in and asks rudely \"what your order, what you order??\" after looking at the menu for only 30 sec. Just the whole ambiance and atmosphere didnt feel right. On top of that the place was filled with 90% caucasians. Certainly didnt feel like an authentic vietnamese restaurant at all. And right behind me was the typical loud mouth american yakking away with his buddies at a 100 decibels. Couldnt take this garbage. I just got up and left. The manager asks why I'm leaving. I said the service sucks. I'm going to Tien Thanh down the street. The dub little troll waitress looks shocked. \"Boo-hoo...\" you lost your tip from me. Stay away from this place if you expect to be treated better than a fast food customer. And reading other reviews here they include the tip of 18% as part of your bill, WTF.... another reason not to come."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite pho in the city. I love their greasy, super super crispy spring rolls and often crave them. The pho stock is #1. Have the rare beef pho, it's totally worth the hype. Service is quick and friendly. Just a warning, this place is packed on weekends. Takeout is great too, but I find pho is better fresh. Love Golden Turtle!"}
{"text":"That Umbrella Guy @ Golden Turtle.

This place is located across the ossington theatre. Like, right down the street at the corner, which is a pretty good location cause lots of people come to watch these live performances. While looking at the menu we noticed one of the actors from the performance come in to pick-up food for the crew.

The interior is decorated brightly with lots of artwork along the walls.
The menu features pho on the first page, and a number of other dishes if you're not here for the pho.

They have S, L, and XL sizes. XL costs $2 extra, but I'd say it's worth it given that it's probably twice the size of the small, in terms of meat and noodles.

Food comes out quick. A bit too quick...but given the amount of customers that suddenly come in during dinner hours, I guess they've figured out a way to push out food quickly while keeping quality consistent (based on the reviews).

The broth was quite light, which I like: it has flavour without tasting watered down, and I can choose how much salt I want to add, which isn't very much for the most part.

XL bowl comes with a lot of noodles and meat, and may be enough for two people!"}
{"text":"No point in a lengthy review.   I think it's all been said: great pho, great spring rolls and great Vietnamese coffee.   I went here based on Jennifer M's review of the veggie pho.  Both were great."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat, but not worth the hype.

Came here on a chilly winter's evening and waited 10-15 mins for a table. It was PACKED. I might note that my party may have been the only Asian people who weren't working there, but that's neither here nor there these days.

We started with the shrimp fresh rolls, which were really very good. The shrimp was very flavourful, a nice change from the usual waterlogged shrimp you get at other places.

The rest of the dinner went downhill. My friends ordered the vegetarian and chicken satay noodles soups and I had the duck and bamboo shoot noodle soup. Although the meals weren't bad, the satays were apparently lacking in the peanut department, and the duck soup was ordinary tasting, and the bamboo shoots were chewy, almost to the point where I wasn't sure if I was supposed to eat them.

In all, the quality is on par with about 80% of the Vietnamese places out there. Not worth the wait or the crowds."}
{"text":"Don't get the avocado shake. I've had it before and it was fine but when we ordered it the other day it tasted off. We told them and they still charged us for it - fine whatever. Ordered it again today (my mistake) hoping it would be back to normal but it still tasted bad.  Told them again - they didn't really care too much and still charged me for it.  I just think they shouldn't sell it at all if the avocados aren't good. I've had the avo shake at Pho Tien Thanh (close by just down Ossington) and there were times they said it wasn't available because the avocado wasn't ripe - which was the nice thing to do! The vermicelli was good though.  I'll probably go back to Pho Tien Thanh from now on to get my pho fix as the food is just as good but the people are a lot nicer there."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time, today.

Good pho, with a couple of options I haven't seen at other places I've been to. The pork spring rolls were just right. Definitely a step up from Ginger and less \"cafeteria\" feeling than Pho Hung. 

The next time I'm along Ossington and wanting some Pho, I'll definitely give them a second shot and try some of their spicier dishes."}
{"text":"I'm seriously obsessed with this place. The Pho is amazing as are the spring rolls. It's all priced really well too. Always busy and popular. I've been going at least weekly, sometimes a couple times a week! Love it!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people think this is the best pho restaurant in Toronto? Their pho doesn't stand out from any other average restaurant in this city. Like others mentioned, service here is rushed. They want you in and out as quickly as possible with rude staff included. If you want amazing vietnamese food with great and happy service, I suggest you try out Pho Tien Thanh down the street."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with friends for a 6:30 dinner on a Friday. I didn't have the Pho, I wanted something heartier. I had the Singapore noodles with shrimp, and the Vietnamese cold spring rolls that I love with pork and shrimp and vermicelli and mint. With hoisin sauce: the bomb. 

My noodles were great but I did wish there had been more of them. More expensive than ginger with the same kind of... anonymous flavours... but a lot less food. So for my meal, it was a miss. With both dishes I was still hungry. My dining partner got a noodle dish that came with a two fried spring rolls in it, and that I was definitely jealous of. 

And, well, after you pay they totally throw you out. Just so you prepare plan b for when you aren't throwing down on a school night. 

But, I hear people live and die by their Pho -so I'll have to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Susur Lee eats here you say?  Then I must try it!  Ordered Jackfruit shake, pho, grilled chick and shrimp with rice and spring rolls of course!

Pho broth tasted authentic and was a ginormous bowl of noodley goodness.  Grilled chicken wasn't what I expected as it came out pre cut into tiny bits.  Shrimp was done perfectly.  Spring rolls are made from rice wrappers so they are crispy but also incredibly greasy.  Would come back for the pho which seemed to be the most popular item.

They have a nice patio...  Busy on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Today I went back to golden turtle with High expectations...however it was just \"meh\" and not as good as I remembered.  Patrons be warned this place is CASH ONLY or you can use the ATM and pay the bank fees if you wish. They have an ATM on site.

The Pho broth was decent but not as home made tasting as before... I could not taste the Love in their pho today as maybe they have gotten too big and perhaps stopped caring as much.  The service was undesireable and well....like most Asian Places is lacking to say the least.

I used to think this was one of the best Pho Spots but I can now conclude that Pho dau Bo on Weston trumps Golden turtle in comparison."}
{"text":"Located on Toronto's quickly gentrifying Ossington strip, this may be the best bowl of Pho in the city. Lunch time is quiet, whereas dinner time, free tables are scarce. 

As for the soup, the broth is fragrant, the rare beef is lean, and the garnishes are classic. For what amounts to a full meal at $6.50, the price is oh so right. Cozy and comforting, two key ingredients for a good pho joint."}
{"text":"Only tried the pho here. Ordered No. 10 with the tendon and tripe and beef slices.

Broth was thicker than most pho places I've been to in Toronto, but i found it to be too much. The tendon and tripe tasted a bit off to me, although the quantity was definitely there! Some other places will skimp on the ingredients, but not this place.

Anyways, with all the pho options in the City, I probably wouldn't come back here based on this experience. This is solely based on taste, as the service was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"1. I'm a Pho & Bun Fiend.
2. I have practically had a bowl of Pho in every city I've been to across North America & parts of the UK.
3. I love Pho, BUT I only categorize Pho in 3 categories.  Awesome, Okay, Bleh.
4. I only have the fully loaded special.

So to qualify for the Awesome Category, the special really has to be FULLY loaded.  Tendons, tripe, the works!  Next is the broth.  You've got to taste the meaty marrowy goodness in the Broth.  3rd is the Noodles.  I'm not so picky, it just has to be the thick kind and not the thin round ones.  Lastly, the service has to be okay.  You don't have to treat me like a prince, but you do have to come serve me in a reasonable amount of time, and be reasonably clean.  Reasonably.  This is Pho after all.  I expect a certain level of dive in my Pho.  

With all this in hand, Rua Vang is... well okay.  It's nothing special, but I'm a quasi regular there whenever I'm in the neighbourhood.  What's missing is Tendons in the special, and the broth is missing a bit of something something.  It's all good, and I'll gladly eat there, but it's not something my Vietnamese pals would go ga-ga over.

Oh.. and the worst Pho I've ever had?  $15 Pho at Treasure Island in Las Vegas, even though I know there's a Pho 88 just off the strip near the airport, I couldn't leave my poker game. :P"}
{"text":"Bun Bo Nuong - Avoid, unless you like chewy, flavorless beef.
Bahn Xeo - Really good.  Really, really good.  
Service - Typical Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Rua Vang aka Golden Turtle is located on the Ossington Strip, with its infamous story of how chef Susur Lee has frequented their establishment.  

There is an outdoor patio which is nice, but the decor is quite simple and un-fancy.  It is setup like your cookie-cutter pho restaurant.  My mother was born in Vietnam, though she is of Chinese descent, so I am harder to please since I get the real stuff at home.

I ordered a plate of Nem Nuong, which is cured pork that comes with romaine lettuce, vermicelli, basil, and bean sprouts.  It also comes with rice paper.  The fun part is the assembly!  Unfortunately my mother never taught me not to play with my food :p  Vietnamese cuisine is a very hands-on type of food also.  I thought it was a little price, ringing in at $12 for basically a plate of veggies and scant servings of pork.  This we shared as a group (there were 4 of us).  You then dip your roll in Nuoc Mam (fish sauce)

For my main I ordere Banh Xeo, which is a Vietnamese \"crepe\" that is filled with bean sprouts, mung beans, and shrimp.  This also came with the same accompaniments as the appetizer (save for the rice paper).  You then douse the \"crepe\" with fish sauce (yes, fish sauce is to Vietnamese as soy sauce is to Chinese).

My other 3 dining companions ended up ordering their preferred versions of pho.  A good bowl of pho rests solely on the flavour and depth in the broth based soup.  I am disappointed to say point blank that the pho broth at the Golden Turtle is nothing spectacular, let alone, deep in flavour.  The chicken strips were tough.  They use the thin variety of rice noodles here.  

Verdict:
At the end of the day, the damage was $47 after tax and tip.  It is a good place to stop by for something inexpensive and that isn't part of a fast food chain.  However, I did noticed a peculiarity in that the pho noodles took the longest to arrive.  Usually, they appear at your table almost instantly upon placing your order.  However, the reverse seemed true at Rua Vang.  At around 10PM, the place was still pretty busy, but by no means packed.  My favourite place for my pho fix is still Pho 88 in Scarborough's Bamburgh Circle."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Vietnamese food with fast service. 

Yes you write your order on a card. That's what you typically do at Vietnamese restaurants - it's fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Decent pho in a kitschy decor 

Da good: fresh noodles, not soggy, good sized wedge of lime on the side with fresh basil, broth lighter than other places

Da so-so: no saw (vietnamese cilantro?) on the herb plate, not enough noodles in the soup-had to get extra and beef was rather cardbordey in texture not as paper thin as I hoped. also couldn't detect the notes of anise, ginger etc that's been raved about in their reviews of the broth

Bottom line: not bad, but not something i would go out of my way for"}
{"text":"I was honestly very disappointed with this place. I'm a huge fan of Vietnamese food but was thoroughly unimpressed with the beef and chicken pho. The broth lacked volume and flavour and the meat was incredibly rubbery. There was not nearly enough lime on hand to squeeze into the massive serving, and the cilantro didn't seem to add anything to the dish.

The value for size was pretty good; $8.50 for a very large serving. The place is packed and they rush you out immediately after finishing your food. They also only accept cash which can be a huge hassle. I honestly don't see where they get the accolades from.. Perhaps I would've preferred dry dishes, but I probably won't be returning to find out."}
{"text":"Fast service. Delicious. Good portion sizes. Very delicious spring rolls and pho."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend expecting the same service as the first time but the consistency was definitely not here. It was a pretty busy afternoon but we got seated right away. First off, when our bowl of pho came the lady was all confused about which orders were ours and insisted that I ordered #2 when I actually ordered #8. She kept pushing my hand away..didnt like that disservice there. When I took the first sip of my broth, it was warm not piping hot like it should be and it tasted oilier than the first time. I also didnt like the fact that even though I ordered just rare beef I got some pieces with fat on it. Not to mention my friend found a fly or bug of some sort in her soup. The fresh shrimp rolls that we ordered also lacked flavour and had browned lettuce. The quality level  has definitely gone down a notch. I don't know if I can say that this place has the best pho noodle soup anymore nor would I come back here again."}
{"text":"Golden Turtle used to be a go-to restaurant for me whenever I wanted cheap and decent vietnamese food. However I'll never be going back after experiencing some of the most rude and disrespectful service I've ever had.

I arrived there with a friend and it was busy but we were able to be seated right away. About a minute after we sit down, we were briskly told to sit at another table in order to accommodate a 4 person group. Sure, whatever, no problem.

I can't complain about the food, it's always been pretty consistent and tasty. My complaint is with the service. While we were about halfway into eating our meals, the server gave us our bill. We certainly weren't even close to being done and I wanted an avocado smoothie. I ordered one and the server was obviously annoyed. She gave it to me in a to go cup. Hint taken.

While we were finishing our meals and drinks, we were rudely asked on THREE different occasions by different servers to pay our bill and leave. It was getting ridiculous by the third time. I'm aware of dining etiquette and I never try to linger in busy restaurants when there are people waiting for tables. However, this was just incredibly disrespectful considering we were still eating our meals at a normal pace and weren't just taking up space while not eating or drinking.

I give it one star because the food is decent but the deplorable service I had on my last visit will ensure I never step foot in Golden Turtle again."}
{"text":"I've given them another try,  but will have to say they haven't improved to their former glory. At least,  if you want a decent clean place and don't mind their extremely warm dining room where food is secondary, then you have found your place."}
{"text":"Best pho I've EVER had! And while I live on the West Coast, I've had lots everywhere in between! I'd particularly like to recommend the satay beef & vegetable (170's)! The grilled pork vermicelli & spring rolls are amazing too!"}
{"text":"To talk the pho, you gotta pay exquisite attention to the broth. It's all about the soup! Then we can mention the garnishes, noodles and meat. But pho is really about the broth.

RV Golden Turtle brings out a good pho, but from personal preference it doesn't suit my bill. Let's start off with the broth. It almost seems like pho places, no matter where, have a standard Pho broth. I'm able to identify the subtle differences, if any, when they are present. My benchmark is Pho 88 or Pho Hung, both on Spadina. They have both been doing the Pho game for a very long time. Anyways, the broth at RVGT is a bit watery. The concentration in flavours aren't quite there. I think it may be due to the type of rice noodles they decided to use. It's a flatter, wider and fresh rice noodle. I think this murks up the broth with its starch and makes it taste a bit diluted.

What I look for in good Pho are noodles with a bite and that are easy to clench with a pair of plastic chopsticks. Wider fresh noodles make it harder to eat and have less chew.

The meat is pretty generic. That's something all Pho places have in common. Sometimes thicker in cut and harder to cook or chew but it's all fine with me.

Overall, RVGT is a smaller Viet Restaurant. I know they don't specialize in Pho in particular, and probably have other great dishes which I haven't tried before, but my bowl of Pho was mediocre at best.

That's Pho Real."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the pho on my last two visits, the broth tasted thin and was overwhelmed by copious amount of green onions; the meat was also dry and not of the best cut - makes me wonder if there's been a change in the kitchen staff recently. I have to now rank it behind Pho Tien Thanh down the street, and Pho Hung on Spadina for best pho in the city."}
{"text":"Love coming here and although we usually stick with our favourites, each time we've experimented, it's been delicious!
Seriously the best pho in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese, beef pho is so simple and tasty and elegant always tastes the same fresh and complex flavours. The lemon grass beef vermicelli is superb, spicy, crunchy hot and cold so good! Also herb wrapped beef rolls are excellent. The house made pickles are so good too. We have been coming here weekly for a decade and the food is so so good. Lots of love to Linda and her family for bringing such wonderful food to our neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place is always Awesome.
Thought that the other place on Ossignton was good, but this place is much much better.
Its become my weekly stop for Pho on the way home from downtown..."}
{"text":"I don't know what is the big rave about this place? People who live in the area or in downtown said it's must eat for Pho (including blogto). The Pho is heavily soiled in MSG - I'm super thirsty an hour later. Meat portion is stingy compared to most joints - they hardly put any meat in their soup. And above all, not exactly a great value. So why should I return? For the time being, I rather go the other place down the street: Pho Tien Thanh. 

If you do go to Golden Turtle, it's CASH ONLY!!"}
{"text":"The grilled shrimp vermicelli is great. Especially considering the price. But what really makes Golden Turtle standout is the service. In a city full of rude, entitled servers, GT takes the crown as being the worst I have encountered.

The younger people who work here are really nice, but the mob of older ladies who run the place are unreal. I have seen them literally tell tables to hurry up and order only a few minutes after they were seated. I once asked for the bill and rather than acknowledging my request, the server (owner?) simply turned to a coworker and started speaking Vietnamese. I got the bill ten minutes later after asking twice more.

They really need to be educated on being civil. I'm not even asking for a smile. Just adhere to simple formalities like acknowledging that you heard and understand my request.

I go here because they are close. Pho Hung in Chinatown is tastier, cheaper, and they won't glower at you for bothering them with your patronage."}
{"text":"Although some dishes are tasty here, the lack of quality service and rude management make this a place i refuse to patronize. Sad to say, I actually received better service at Pho Hung. It's hard to enjoy a meal when even your waitress would (understandably) rather be somewhere else.."}
{"text":"At last!  I've finally found pho that tastes like something you would find on the means streets of Saigon.  Unfortunately for the Golden Turtle, I never really was a fan of the 'authentic' pho that they serve in Vietnam.

1. Portion sizes are just right
2. Vietnamese owned
3. Cool hip area without the inflated prices

---CONS---
1. Broth isn't as complex as other pho places, I think it lacks that sweetness you get from star anise
2. Broth was cloudy
3. They use dry noodles for their pho, not fresh (like 90% of pho places in TO)
4. In the bun (vermicelli), the noodles were dry
5. Claim to fame is Susur Lee goes here to eat.  I personally don't give a flying fuck who goes where to eat.  This pho just isn't what it's cracked up to be.
6. Green onion overload!!!

Overall, this place is just average.  I haven't been down the road to Pho Tien Thanh, but I would be very surprised if PTT is worse than the Golden Turtle.  If you aren't living in the area, this place is not worth the drive to.  Stick to Pho Pasteur on Dundas or Vietnam Noodle Star in Scarborough."}
{"text":"This was recommended by the friends I was with for our weekend in Toronto. We headed to Golden Turtle around 6pm on a Sunday night. The place was pretty busy but we were seated right away. Thankfully, the door was open which created a nice breeze in the hot weather.

I ordered bun (vermicelli) which came with beef and spring roll, a Vietnamese staple. There's nothing special about it, to me, it's the same at every Vietnamese restaurant I go to. The spring roll was great and the meat was grilled perfectly. 

I also ordered a Vietnamese cold coffee. The cup was filled with so much ice that it difficult to move the straw around. I left it to melt while I ate. If you enjoy iced coffee and haven't tried Vietnamese coffee, I would recommend it. The condensed milk gives it the right sweetness. I enjoyed it.

I would return for a quick lunch/dinner if I was in the area again.

Note: They take Cash Only!"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was delicious!  I love this type of ordering system too - where you just write down what you want on the receipt that they bill you with at the end of the meal.  An overall great experience here."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 4.5.  I can easily eat here once a week.
It's great comfort food and at a very affordable price.
Casual dress and close to where I live.
Quite the hidden gem.  Generally if there is a line up, the wait is not very long. The dishes are made quick so you don't have to wait too long to get your food.
Bathrooms are in the basement and be careful going down the stairs.  Not the greatest - but then again most asian bathrooms aren't that great.  
I have been here a multiple amount of times and have tried over a dozen dishes and can say that there is not a bad dish.
Any of the Satay bun dishes are amazing.  Spring rolls are great.  The broth in the soups are awesome.  
One advice:  Bring Cash - no credit cards - cash only.  However, I recently returned (nov 2014) and they have a cash machine at the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the rare beef spicy pho, fresh spring rolls and avocado shake. 

The spicy pho was delish.  Really really good.  The spring rolls had a warm component that was a pleasant surprise (tho I'm not sure what it was).  The avocado shake was smaller than I expected, but a good size given the richness.

Wonderful! Will absolutely go back.

NOTE:  They are CASH _ONLY_"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a girlfriend to catch up. We ordered spring rolls and pho because I had yelped this place before I went, I sort of knew what to expect... It may be my fault, but we took a really long time to order and when I realized this place was cash only, I scurried to the bank to withdraw some bills. The order came within 10 minutes of ordering and by that time, I was starved. 

Spring rolls were hot, but a bit oily I liked the filling. I got pho with rare beef and tripe and the soup was really, really, really salty. I was chugging down water like a dry field when it rains while we were there. Pho is supposedly really good, but it was overpowered by the copious amounts of salt. I liked the flavour of the broth when I could taste  

Come here if you want some bloat with your morning routine. I'd come here if I ever get tired of pho in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap (although I wish they took Credit Cards), good Vietnamese! The interior is nothing to call home about, but that's not what this place is about- if you're looking for a casual dinner to catch up with friends, then this is a good spot for that."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and we ordered one vegetarian pho and one vermicelli. Everything was fine but it was nothing special. The portions were a bit smaller than at other places and it's definitely more expensive."}
{"text":"Ossington has tons to offer in terms of food spots, it's actually kind of overwhelming. I was glad to have my brother and sister-in-law's recommendation for this place. We hiked Webster Falls and Dundas Peak and were STARVING so Golden Turtle was a perfect fit for us. 

The food came out SO fast. It was incredibly fresh and flavorful. I had the spicy lemongrass bun (91) and added a spring roll. Brother had rare beef soup. We also ordered a plate of sautéed spicy veggies and some Singapore noodles. Everything was delicious. 

This place also has a pretty nice outdoor patio so perfect for dinners on a summer evening. Will definitely return next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Walked in with a group of 14 on a hot summer evening and they were able to quickly accommodate us. Food came within 5 minutes of ordering. Classic Vietnamese food- pho, rice, and vermicelli- sufficient to satisfy the vietnamese food cravings. 

Warning: cash only!"}
{"text":"Given the lack of suitable pho to be found in the downtown area, my expectations were low. The place is packed with your hipsters making it a hassle to get that table. It seems as though their neighbor down the street (Pho Tien Thanh) might be the better option. But then again, there is more than enough room for two pho restos on Ossington.

The pho is pretty decent. The broth is flavorful yet clear. The quanitity of noodles is stingy but the abundance of beef brisket and green onions makes for a hearty soup bowl. 

The real winners are the non-pho dishes. The grilled pork chop was delicious. Likely marinated for at least a day and grilled right. The shredded pork skin and chopped egg balanced a great rice dish. 

Overall. I'd choose to go here over any Chinatown pho location. Awaiting my chance to try their neighbor to get the real comparison. Dinner for under 10 bucks is always great."}
{"text":"The best pho in the city and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."}
{"text":"I had the pho with rare beef and tendon and the pork skin cold rolls.

Nothing really stood out, although the tea they gave me was very hot.

No bean sprouts or coriander with the pho, and it was a very mild broth.  I don't see why anyone would call it the best in the city, because it was really very plain and boring.

The cold rolls were well wrapped, although I probably should have gotten the shrimp or veggie ones.

If you're trying to decide between here and Pho Tien Thanh, don't go here for pho!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money! 

The owner/ waitress with short hair, black skirt , plump figure with glasses or whoever she is , try to kick us out before we even finish our meal. 

She started cleaning all the chair and dishes while we are still eating. We eventually asked for the bill when she almost take our spoon away.
 Its not even 30 minutes since we made the order. Unbelievable customer service, that lady need to be banned from serving food to anybody, a disgrace to all waiter and waitress.

0/10 not recommended to anyone , avoid this restaurant if you do not want to be treated like begger. 
I will give my patron to Pho Tien Thanh , one block away from now on."}
{"text":"Tasteless, watery, broth in my bowl (Pho Tai Chin.)
The prices are higher than average for this kind of place.
The service is un-authentic for a family-run no-nonsense hole-in-the-wall.
Very few Vietnamese clientele. There are reasons why.
I hated it."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pho for takeout Got a medium size compared to what swerved in the restaurant. When I ordered I said no fat and no cilantro I get home and it's more than half nasty fat.  Go back to the restaurant on foot to exchange it and they gave me major attitude. Made it seem like I was being unreasonable because I didn't want fat in it. I would highly recommend going down about four doors to the other pho restaurant."}
{"text":"Hopped off the plane and went to meet friends at the Golden Turtle for Pho.
Always #1 Large - rare beef. my comfort food. fresh basil, sprouts and lime squeezed freely. always add a bit of hot sauce, sometimes (like today) a bit of hoisin.

is it the best pho in the world?
NO

is the staff ever friendly?  do they ever smile?
NO

but i like it here. decent pho. always fresh tasting (the place is generally busy)

still NO credit cards or debit cards.

it's part of my toronto and always will be.

had the spring rolls. a bit too greasy. not really flavourful and the dipping sauce is a bit bland.

but will i be back?
YES

don't you have places that feel like HOME?"}
{"text":"This place is now open 11a-945p says the sign in the restaurant. It also has a pretty good patio for the summer.

They have like every combination of \"bun\", I wanted shrimp and spring roll. Fully expecting maybe 2-3 shrimp and a spring roll, instead it comes with one shrimp and two spring rolls. I really wish I got the extra shrimp instead, two spring rolls is too much. It's quite large and tasty though, need a second plate to hold those spring rolls while I mix in the fish sauce.

I've come here before to have the pho, it's satisfying.

Apparently Strombo comes here regularly, haven't seen him yet but I'll be on \"celebrity\" watch."}
{"text":"I don't know if I would call it the best pho in the city, but it's big portions, cheap and pretty nom. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good portion of veggies, noodles, and meat. Nice friendly staff! This place is great for cold weather such as today. One thing i'd have to critique would be the really cramped up space, but that's not something that they could change."}
{"text":"My favorite vietnamese restaurant in gta. The price is great, and the quality of food is great too.

They have a patio area too which is nice to sit in the summer. The place can get busy and there are usually waits for table near meal times."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. We go every Sunday with the kids. Delicious food, quick, inexpensive. A happy place."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for over 10 years and I'm thinking it's time to stop soon. The prices have been going thru the roof while the service has been dropping thru the basement.

Last evening we asked a server why they gave us a chicken veggie rice dish when we ordered a beef veggie rice. She started chastising us about ordering it non-spicy when we should have specified spicy! hUh?? If she didn't understand our question she should have asked us to repeat it instead of yelling 
at us first! When she finally realised our question, she figured out we had written the wrong number ... So fine. It was our fault.

 But if you're going to charge 18% tip right off the bat (which they did,)... Then maybe providing some service would be appropriate... But nope. Nada. 

Just really bad attitude, and awful service. I'm not surprised that they're much less busy then they were a few years ago."}
{"text":"Fast and efficient service. My husband & I have been eating at Pho Hung on Spadina for years. Ate here for the first time & have to say I'm very impressed. Salad rolls were super fresh & soft. The pho was steeping hot and tasty. The vermicelli delicious. We will definitely be back. It will easily become our new favourite place for Pho, to get my fix.

If you're looking for fine dining, ambience, decor, this is not the place. It's simple and clean, typical Vietnamese family style restaurant. Customers generally sit down, eat, pay the bill and leave. If you're interested in eating good Pho & not picky about atmosphere, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"growing up in mississauga i developed a picky taste for pho. it's all about the broth for me and i like golden turtle because it's not too salty or too heavy. might be light for others, but i really, really like it."}
{"text":"You can debate about 'better' pho in the area, Golden Turtle is very good.
You can't go wrong in this area, unless it's PEAK time and it's too busy.
Also, it's 2017 and business not offering cc/debit, it's lazy and being cheap.  
This FALSE idea that cash makes the process quicker is completely untrue, tapping a cc or interac card beats any atm/service fee for customer.  I'm not the only person who rarely carries cash these days, essentially the Golden Turtle is created 'work' for their customers (atm/fees/prep)."}
{"text":"this is pretty much a five for me, being that the only thing that held it back were the deep fried spring rolls rolling in oil.  youd think that you might be able to say what do you expect, but ive had less greasy ones elsewhere.  so imagine 4.5 if youd like.

this places decor is pretty standard with some paper and some framed vietnamese pictures on the walls; its got this mirror running the length of the restaurant thats cut in wavy lines and where we were sitting a few beautiful plants, 2 of which were bonzai.

i had #14 which had rare beef, well done beef, beef balls, tripe and tendon (though im not sure which part was the tendon...but if it was there i ate it) and the broth was aromatic and rich, the meet tender, the noodles plentiful and the tea soothing.

so thats that."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times and I can never say no to the pho! I've tried both the vegan and the chicken and I much prefer the latter. It's some of the finest pho I've had in this city with a flavourful broth and quality chicken breast sliced throughout. Other places known for being superior lose me in the chicken department, but Golden Turtle does it right. 

Service here is quick, both earning and losing them some points. Last time I was there some friends of ours came in just as we were finishing our meals. We chatted for a couple minutes, but then GT refused to serve them saying the kitchen was now closed. The restaurant was still full and they had already seated them, so I felt upset on their behalf especially since our entire conversation was pretty much about the pho. Points docked for confusing service. This time GT said no to the pho!

If you're in the Ossington area, this is a great place to grab a warm bowl of soup. Portions are generous, but like previous reviewers said, the service can be a bit rush-rush. Despite this, I have had no issues with incorrect orders or anything of the sort. It's your standard affair with a comforting flair."}
{"text":"Having heard many great things about this restaurant, I decided to bring a visiting Montreal friend.  We arrived to a bustling restaurant and excitedly settled into the 2-seater spot at the window in the front.  We ordered the fresh shrimp rolls, they were okay but nothing special.  When the Pho arrived we were disappointed at the amount of MSG in the broth.  Now don't get me wrong, I like a little MSG in my broth, but the Golden Turtle broth was saturated.  Maybe we lucked out and got the bottom of the pot?  Needless to say we drank a lot of tea to try to clear the MSG from our tongues.  

Honestly there are much better Pho places in Toronto.  I don't know what all the hype with this place is based on?"}
{"text":"Pros: Price, Location, Pho broth
Cons: Customer service, fatty meat dishes, raunchy fish sauce compared to other viet restos, no debit

The employees HATED there job.
They don't organize properly
The employees never smile
They don't acknowledge you
They make so much noise when they clean up tables around you"}
{"text":"Wow I have never received so much attitude from a restaurant before! WORST service ever. They yelled at us after we told them it was rude to give us our bill THREE times while we were still eating. 1st time was shortly after we got our food. Friend and I were obviously surprised so we put it aside. They then put down a 2nd bill. We gave it back and said \"Look, we're still eating.\" Minutes later, they gave us our bill for the 3rd time! When we spoke up, the girl raised her voice and was like, \"This is how we run our business!\" I would NOT recommend this place!

PS - food wise Tien Thanh down the street is SO much better!!"}
{"text":"This has been touted as the best pho in town, only rivaled by their nemesis(or friends?) down the street. This is probably my fifth time around and I think I am finally ready to review them. It was a bit difficult to digest all the rave reviews and I can see why they do get the attention that they do. This place is approachable, comfortable and serves up a decent bowl of pho. I would say their ratings are more for the former than the latter.

The pho is nicely balanced in flavour with hints of herbs and spices though not quite as pronounced as some other places in town. The beef is above average but nothing to really write home about. The overall depth of flavour is good but not quite memorable. The soup is rather clean and grease-less which is a good thing for the most part. Though you need a certain amount of fat in the soup to really bring the flavours up another notch. The noodles are done right. Portion wise they are a little skimpy.

I wouldn't hesitate to give them an A-ok 3 stars but considering the attentive service we consistently receive I am going to throw in an extra star. It's quite difficult to find a Vietnamese restaurant that is so approachable for non-Asians let alone one that provides over the top service.

Cash only."}
{"text":"The food here are not really authentic in my opinion but still fine with the taste. I regret ordering \"mi Quang\" bealcause the noodle was pretty bad even though the soup is ok. \"Bun mam\" is also not get the true taste at all. The rice and pho is acceptable."}
{"text":"I decided to venture out from the norm one night and go up to the golden turtle on ossington. I had a couple people that told me it wasn't too bad so I decided to give it a try. When you get to their door you'll notice all their stickers from yelp as well as TorontoLife and what not.

After sitting down I decided to order the special pho as well as the spring rolls; my wife ordered the grilled pork bun.

First thing I'd like to mention is the spring rolls were not like their neighbours down south. They're the normal sized spring rolls as you would expect. Personally I didn't like them as much. I found them milled way too much. 

As for the pho it was average. The broth was really good but in terms of ingredients it was balls, literally. There was an abundance of beef balls in the soup as well as beef brisket and tripe. Personally I found the brisket really tough as well. 

The bun was not amazing. Really didn't set itself from anyone else. 

I'd have to say that unless you are dead set on coming to the golden turtle, give the place down the street 2 blocks a try. It's WAY better."}
{"text":"Three reasons why you should go to Golden Turtle:

1) Service is quick and efficient
2) Food is ALWAYS yummy
3) SO CHEAP

Your trip to the Ossington strip does not have to cost lots of money! My boyfriend and I had a lovely dinner at Golden Turtle the other night and we only spent 30 dollars. Also, I'm convinced they serve the best pho in the city.

Three reasons why you should not go to Golden Turtle:

1) You don't live in Toronto
2) You hate yummy food
3) You rather spend A LOT of money on your meal

You're welcome."}
{"text":"The food was fairly okay overall. My top choice was probably the spring rolls. The pho did not meet my expectations. To me there are other pho places in Toronto that offer more authentic taste and experience at cheaper prices."}
{"text":"I'm reading the reviews posted here and it appears what I was going to say has been covered. I will add however, that the pho here as far as I've experienced was not bad. The broth was good, the beef, the onion ratio, etc. The issue I had was so-so service by employees that were more engaged with each other than the customer and spoke less than functional English. I asked for slightly fatty beef and they accommodated then the next few times said yes but didn't do so. I understand English for most of their workers is a second language, but it's frustrating not knowing if you'll actually get what you ordered. The rare beef is tough too, as was described by other reviewers. Appetizers were decent.

As also mentioned in other reviews, I'd go here if need be, but Pho Tien Thanh down the street is way better. No contest."}
{"text":"[location] 4/5

[Overall] 5/5
We have been to this restaurant many times, keep trying different food and they are always good. Great location, price, taste and portion!"}
{"text":"Went here for some pho with one of my best buddies! 

He has been coming here for decades! 

I had pho with chicken - I got the smallest size and it was still too much for me - but my goodness, it was excellent!"}
{"text":"If you know me, you know how much I love my Pho... this time I ventured to Ossington Ave for my favorite soup. This place is legit. The broth has a perfect balance is spice and flavor. The spring rolls are super crispy and tasty. I also had the fresh rolls which were light and delish. It's a busy place, but despite that, it's still pretty cozy and comfortable. There's a heated patio, which may be your only choice if the inside is packed. Bring cash, as they don't accept cards. The location is great and that's why they're sitting on a goldmine. Go for gold!"}
{"text":"Recommendation: Satay pho

The real winner is the Satay pho. The satay adds a nice kick to the broth without having to use a lot of hot sauce. If I remember correctly, for $1 you can add vegetables (broccoli, etc).

The minimalist rare beef pho is great. Not the best I've ever had, but it's quite good.

The pho portions are not as big as other places, but it's not a big deal. Still makes for a very cheap meal.

The egg + shrimp pancake is great as an appetizer. Summer rolls (transparent skin with shrimp and vermicelli) are also solid.

Durian milkshake is great.

Finally, they take a bare bones approach to service. You won't become best friends with your server, but they're relatively quick and efficient.

Bonus: The portuguese bakery across the street is great for dessert."}
{"text":"A good bowl of pho that comes out really fast once you've figured out which variation you want. The broth is light but flavorful, noodles are solid, and they do give a good portion of meat for the price. I have a personal preference for tendon, and found their offering of tendons different than the one's I'm use to. Less of the soft gelatinous tendon, and more actual muscle surrounding it. Still good, but different.

Service is fast, efficient and friendly. Obviously a well oiled family operation that keeps a balance between keeping things moving and letting you enjoy a hot meal at your own pace. The space is bright and well lit, and the staff makes an effort to keep the floors dry even on a snowy wet winter day."}
{"text":"Okay - so my friend and I were walking around  Ossington the other day just for vintage shopping.  It just so happened that we passed by Golden Turtle and I recalled on BlogTO that it was voted one of the best places for pho.  It was 3 in the afternoon, but somehow, we got sucked into eating some pho.

And I'm glad we went.

Firstly, we were quickly seated, but this may be because it was 3 PM in the afternoon.  We ordered the special (including chicken) pho, and some fresh rolls with shrimp.  The rolls weren't the best - slightly bland, but the sauce was great.

The pho.  OMG.  I was searching for some good pho in Toronto - a lot of places aren't that great and you just want to drink an abundance of water/tea after eating it due to the MSG.  However, I did not have to put any sauce or anything in the pho.  It was just perfectly made.

Service wasn't the greatest though.  Hence why one less star."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, very authentic BUT their customer service is TRASH. I would frequently come to this location but I will no longer be their customer ever again. I ordered an Avocado milkshake, it tasted funky so I informed the staff. The manager, came running out at me telling me how it is not powder and that it is fresh, yes I understand but something doesn't taste right. She ran back into the kitchen and came back with a bag of avocado in my face, kept shoving it in my face and telling me it is fresh. I understand your food is fresh, all I'm saying it does not taste right. After all that, we found HAIR in our food, grey hair, we are disturbed. Sorry, not sorry but bye!"}
{"text":"Haven't had Pho for 5 months so I wanted to service the craving and try one of the well reviewed places I haven't been to yet. Rua Vang, along with Pho Linh & Tien Thanh have been on my list forever but diner downtown before 10PM is a rarity for me so it's usually PASTEUR  or NOTHING.

Tien Thanh had a line up on a Wednesday with only an hour to go, so Plan B - Turtle it was! Sadly it didn't live up to it's Yelp stars on this night.  

First impression was good. Staff was super nice. The cleanliness & general upkeep exceeded expectations \"for this market segment\" ahem...no seriously it was spartan but perfectly maintained compared to Spadina area places.

First warning sign: all the Asians (presumably neighborhood Viets) are eating BBQ while only hipsters & White Millennials are ordering Pho - sure sign that the smart money is on the BBQ while the Pho is the \"hook\" and profit vehicle (for less demanding palettes). But I came to compare the Pho so ... 

Got my usual Flank & Tendon deal.  The actual beef was REALLY nice cuts, and they gave bigger chunks of Tendon than many other places. However, the broth was the blandest, most washed out broth I ever had. No dimensions at all. Like they were running low and decided to add water to increase the quantity. Just substandard. My friend had Seafood Noodles (#30 whatever that is) which was OK but unremarkable. The best thing was the Salad Rolls with Sausage - very fresh greens and again, fine quality meat.  But I didn't drive like a maniac to get there by 9pm and snare a parking spot just to get nice rolls. 

Tough to judge a Pho place from only one visit, I know consistency is difficult when cooking form scratch with real food, but if Pho is in your restaurant's name and the main draw of your business, it should never be this bad. With so many other choices, I doubt I'll get around to a second chance for Golden Turtle."}
{"text":"I'm a huge pho lover, and any good vietnamese place should have decent pho in my opinion.  Not sure if the quality has declined, but unfortunately the pho I ordered wasn't too great.  It took a long time to arrive (my friends' non-pho dishes came out first), and when it did the soup was bland, the noodles were hard, and meat wasn't too good.  

One of the reviews below said the pho is MSG free ... so that could explain the reason.  But if I wanted a MSG bland soup noodle I wouldn't go for pho."}
{"text":"When it comes to new dishes, I'm really hesitant and picky about my first time experience. I feel that if everything isn't right, and the experience is ruined, I'll be turned off from a certain type of dish forever. 

I was taken to Golden Turtle for my first Pho experience--something that I've been planning for a long time, but never got to experience because I didn't have someone that was confident enough to introduce it to me.

Golden Turtle's Pho is amazing. Tasty, large portions at a great value and what I would probably consider the closest thing to a real Vietnamese Pho experience without having to actually visit Vietnam. 

Tight seating but great atmosphere with the smell of Pho and other dishes emanating out of the kitchen. Enjoyed a great meal with beer and loads of slurping. Golden Turtle is known for not adding MSG into their dishes.

Highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"My favourite pho place in the city. Great tasting broth, spring rolls and fast service. Love the patio too."}
{"text":"Honestly.. I will start the review off by saying, just go to pho tien thanh down the street.

I ordered the pho with rare beef, well done beef, tripe, and tendon. Well there was no rare beef to be found in my bowl =( The broth is good, but tasted very light and was not hot enough. Thumbs up for no MSG. The noodles were just standard (and you will only know the good from the bead after trying pho tien thanh's noodles). The bean sprouts weren't very fresh. The tripe was tough. The only good part was the execution of the tendon, it was the only outstanding part of the meal.

The service sucks and the 4 Vietnamese ladies WILL NOT stop talking to each other across the dining room."}
{"text":"I had the rare beef and beef tripe pho. For start, the beef wasn't rare, should have been put into the soup last. It's okay for me. Usually other pho places have a special noodle soup which is the best deal, but I didn't see it here. I ordered a small one, which was already pretty filling for me."}
{"text":"I liked it! Being from downtown I took the time to travel to ossington as many people have told me how great it is. I have had friends who told me they were rude, but no, not at all. I was greeted warmly and when I say down, the same guy came back to see if I wanted to share my table, very nicely. 

I had the tripe, well done beef and tendon pho, he size is a little small, but the broth was simply delicious. It was so sweet that at one point I was wondering if they added sugar to it. But no it was not overpowering so then I realized that the broth was just great.

Oh they don't have that three colour drink that has mung beans, coconut jelly and red beans. Just a note

Definitely going back"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years. OK Pho overall, but not amazing. The last time I was there (July) we decided to sit on the Patio. We noticed a LOT of Wasps around after being seated. Once our order arrived, we started eating - then, cue Wasp. Bam. Right into our soup. Seeing as Wasps kinda will eat/land on just about anything - we asked our Server if it might be possible to have another bowl of Soup and move inside. 
 Their attitude was, well - kinda shitty. ie: \"Buyer beware\". They also cited some obscure City code stating they weren't liable for Wasps in Soup.Which is fair, it's kind of an act of Nature. That said though, conventional wisdom would either have them put up Wasp control measures, or - well, have some skills in customer service...? ie: \"Sure we'll give you another soup, but we'll only charge you 1/2 of the cost\". Something vs. \"Sorry about your luck, fu\"."}
{"text":"Not sure why the staff had to mop floors while we were eating and the restaurant is still open with customers. Tried the vermicelli and pho it was standard fare. The smell of cleaning supplies wafting up to me while we were eating ruined my appetite and we left the food half eaten."}
{"text":"Clientes de longa data deste restaurante dizem que algo mudou, pois era um lugar excelente para provar comida vietnamita, mas que ultimamente andava bem caído.
Posso dizer da minha própria experiência que o lugar está realmente acabado!

A começar por um atendimento péssimo, estávamos em quatro pessoas e a pessoa que nos atendeu começou nos dizendo que não se devia vir em muita gente pois o lugar é pequeno (4 pessoas é muita gente? Sério isso?)

Pedimos a tradicional sopa vietnamita, eu pedi com frango e estava gostosa porém com pouquíssimos pequenos pedaços de frango. Minha amiga pediu com beef, o qual veio mais gordura do que qualquer outra coisa. Ela pediu com delicadeza se poderiam trocar, porque ela não pode comer gordura assim, explicou que havia pedido o de beef (que anos atrás vinha servido de pedaços de beef, não de gordura).
A mulher se negou a trocar, começou a falar super alto com ela e ainda disse que se não sabia o que estava pedindo, que se informasse antes de ir até lá.

No final das contas acabamos não comendo direito, pagamos e fomos embora com fome.
Fiquei muito decepcionada com o lugar, realmente algo aconteceu por lá.
Não recomendo!"}
{"text":"If you're coming for the Pho, you won't be disappointed.  Sure, you could go to the place just down the street, which has better service.  But then you'd be passing up the delicious broth that Golden Turtle has to offer.  

Be prepared for the staff to try and rush you out of the restaurant, when it looks like you're done your meal (or when it looks like there is a line at the door, even if you're only half way through your meal).  

My rating is based on the food.  Not the service.  I can look past that - and have come to expect it from a number of Chinese / Vietnamese restaurants around the city.  

If you want service with a smile, there are other places for you.  If you want large portions of delicious Pho, this is for you."}
{"text":"It's good pho but they force you to pay 18% gratuity in groups more than 4. That is pretty high for no service."}
{"text":"Hands down best Pho I've had in my life. Noodles, meats and broth were all excellent. Specifically,  the noodles stayed firm throughout and the broth has some kind of sweetness to it without being too acidic that you see in some other places that overload with MSG.

Also grabbed a fried spring roll with pork which was nice but not necessary since the Pho was appropriately sized (got the xl for 10.50 and I was completely full - a rarity).

Price decent, food top notch. Seems very authentic as well . Just wish it was a little closer"}
{"text":"Best pho in the city!! It's so fast, don't be thrown off by the full house or line up out the door. They're quick to serve and have you out the door! I honestly get the same thing EVERY SINGLE TIME; 
Rare beef pho & veggie spring rolls. Can't go wrong :)"}
{"text":"As usual I got the bun bo hue. This is the only place that does not serve it with Vietnamese sausage. Either that or they forgot to put it in mine. A little disappointed about that but the broth was good. Price is the same as most places for a decent portion. Service was fast. Would definitely come back again if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I had a Shrimp Soup there, not a pho. Something I usually have at all vietnamese restaurants I go and I usually like because it's full of vegetables, the broth is dense, tasty, and spicy. 

The \"vegetables\" were basically green onion, half tomato and bamboo sprouts. The broth had a weird smell and absolutely no taste. I was hungry after waiting for about 20 minutes, and the only good thing I can say about the soup, it was made with 10 jumbo shrimps - I counted! 

To eat the soup, I put so much hot sauce that I think my server understood I didn't like it. 

Tea was served in a glass and wasn't very good either. I'm only giving 2 stars because of the jumbo shrimp orgy."}
{"text":"Soursop shake! If only you could make this vegan without the milk, but alas, they refused."}
{"text":"Had a pho here today for lunch. Got the rare beef with well done flank. Soup was quite good, but the beef pieces, especially the well done flank was very chewy. My wife got beef vermicelli which was on point, got little jealous. 
One down side of this place is they only accept cash and they got an atm at the front of the restaurant. In my opinion, restaurant not only save money on not having POS machine, but they actually make commission on these atms. Screwing customers over... Won't be returning anytime soon"}
{"text":"Food was good quality and cheap, although portions were a bit small. Bright lights, cramped tables, prompt service - standard pho place.  I'm not opposed to going back.

Cash only, with an ATM in the corner."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the vegetarian pho here. The broth for the pho is nice and clean. It's one of the options out there for when you are looking for a light meal. The spring rolls are really greasy (to the point where you have to wipe them on your napkin) but for some reason I keep ordering them. I wouldn't recommend them though. I think I just want something a little more to eat with my pho...

The service isn't the greatest, but I really don't care as long as the food gets to me hot and is delicious."}
{"text":"I just had my first experience at Rua Vang Golden Turtle this past Sunday and I could not be happier! It was a nice day so we sat out on the patio, which has room to seat many. 

Whenever I go out for Pho I always end up ordering the same thing, which is the bbq'd pork and shrimp vermicelli with a spring roll. I can't get away from it, but I think it's because its a nice light meal that seems pretty healthy! This was probably the best vermicelli bowl I've had. They made it with the freshest ingredients and the portion size was great. Sometimes I find the bowls are a bit too much to eat, and I have a pretty big appetite, but this one was the perfect size. 

I think the thing that shocked me beyond the freshness at this place was the speedy service we received. Our food was served in a very timely manner. Definitely ideal if you're looking to go somewhere for a quick lunch. 

While this place is not close to home, I will most definitely be going back, but need to remember for next time that they are a cash only place!"}
{"text":"Always a wholesome meal. Love the Pho Ga bowl, add as much seasoning as you like. I like it spicey !

Great spot when you're in the mood for soup, go there all the time."}
{"text":"Can't say that this is the best Pho place in town but they drum up a mean broth.  I always order the large bowl with beef brisket, tripe and tendon.  There really isn't much of the last two but there was some decent slices of brisket. One of my friends found a fruit fly in hers. Talk about the wrong type of extra protein. Had they added more meat I would have been pleased. The fresh roll lettuce never tastes clean and fresh the way it should so these guys need to go back to the same game plan when they first opened if they're looking for my biz again."}
{"text":"I was told it's the best pho in in the city but the big one on spadina is way better. The broth was nothing to write home about and the meat was fatty and over cooked even though we got rate beef. Wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"My first experience here will be my last as there is a better option next door at Pho Tien Thanh. Their dishes are more flavorful and they treat their customers with respect. The service at this restaurant is horrendous even for an Asian establishment. 

We ordered a Vietnamese crepe, beef pho, bun rieu and a condensed milk and egg yolk soda which were all average/ lacking in flavour. The beef pho did seem to have slightly more meat than some other places. 

All throughout our meal the server kept rushing us to leave and taking our plates away when we were still eating from them. She would take a used napkin off of our table while we engaged in conversation and throw them immediately on our plates still in progress so that we couldn't even stop her and pull the plates back to let her know we were still eating.

The worst came at the end of the evening when it came time for the bill. It was thrown on the table without being asked for as soon as my companion was done eating his meal but I was still working on mine. 

This place is cash only, complete with an atm in the restaurant so they can take a kickback off of the service fees it makes. We put down $40 for a $33 meal which was double counted by the both of us due to the stack of $5s we included and did not receive any change back. When asked, the server came back with only $1 and yelled loudly at us insisting that we only gave her $35, to look in our wallets to see that we were wrong and ran away.  There are places where the food is so epic that you can overlook the horrible service. This place is definitely not one of them."}
{"text":"This place used to be a good alternative to the usual Chinatown for Pho despite its food not being the greatest but there is easy street parking so the convenience always pulled me back. But the food has been consistently mediocre and the customer service borderline unacceptable.

They brought our bill right after they collected our bowls and despite of us not having finished our shakes, we were asked to vacate our tables. This did not just happen to us. We overhead other people being asked to leave to accommodate for new customers coming in too. Needless to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"amazing broth, the large size bowls actually isn't as huge as it seems, there's not thaat much noodle in it I think it's just more broth. really great food for the price though! definitely must try"}
{"text":"Lokal ist klein, aber fein. Original vietnamesisches essen. Sehr authentisch, alles frisch. Kleiner Nachteil: der ist immer sehr überfüllt! Also Wartezeit mit einrechnen, wenn man schon was leckeres essen möchte. Auch darauf achten welche Größe man nehmen möchte. Für normale Leute reicht L aus. Warum L? Weil die Schüsseln recht groß ausfallen. Wer sich nicht sicher ist, dann lieber mit S anfangen.

Und das in Toronto, Ontario Kanada."}
{"text":"Some times the best places are off the beaten path. It may not look like much from the outside and their decor might not be top notch, but it's not about that whatsoever. If you don't get stuck on the decor, you'll notice the delicious aroma of broth coming out of the kitchen and the patrons all slurping their noodles around you. 

Yes, it's crowded, cramped, and small, but you're just happy that you can sit and be that much closer to drinking that delicious Pho broth. They've got an interesting ordering system. They drop off menus enough for everyone at the table, a pencil, and a piece of green order pad paper. The concept is you write your own order down and they come by and pick it up a few mins later. I guess it makes it efficient that they don't have to stand over you and wait for you to debate over what to get. 

They have one of the most delicious Pho broth I've ever had. I'm jealous that the city of Toronto has this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was walking down Ossington and I was HANGRY! Not hungry..angry+hungry=HANGRY! So luckily, I came across this lovely spot and I was not disappointed. I have no idea what was in their fried rice but it was seriously the best fried rice I have ever had. MAGICAL. The service was exceptional as well.  I just wish this was closer to my place so that I could have the best fried ever all the time."}
{"text":"Get the Banh Xeo. (Vietnamese omlet/panckae). It's to die for. Seriously amazing.. made of coconut milk, egg and rice flour, with juicy shrimp and bean sprouts, with the crispy consistency of a crepe. 

Other things are great about here as well, location, low prices, and authentically owned by a family from Vietnam. 

Everything I've had here is excellent,  Pho Ga and Banh Cuon and Goi Cuon.  (chicken soup, spring rolls and fresh rolls!)

They have a nice space and a decent patio."}
{"text":"My first time here and I loved the pho here. Service was a bit abrupt but I would go back for the food. They got filled up really fast at lunch today even with the crazy rainy weather. 

The waitress seemed to remember what the regulars want even before they ordered. I had a veggie pho with the beefstock broth & a condensed milk coffee. I have had pho in about 5 different places before and the broth here is so fresh and flavourful. I went on my own and didn't realize I said \"omg so good\" out loud :$

I will definitely go back to try everything else on their menu.

This will be #1 on my pho list, unless I find something better ;)"}
{"text":"How this place passes off as the number #1 Pho in Toronto is beyond me. Like c'mon BlogTO, get your act together! Anyone in the know will tell you that this place is way overrated, especially with a superior option a block south of here. 

I've simply stopped going, but had no choice that night due to the lines at the other unnamed establishment. Furthermore, pho addiction is REAL, and I need to get my fix pronto!

Anyway, a real good sign of any ethnic restaurant is it's clientele. Although not always a good leading indicator (I've been surprised before), I was literally the only Vietnamese person - aside from the employees in the restaurant. They clearly didn't know this either, because they were talking smack about some of the guests in their native language quite openly. I found this extremely unprofessional! Upon ordering for the table (speaking Vietnamese), the waitress literally froze and clearly embarrassed knowing I could understand everything they were saying. What a joke...

Alright, so food-wise, the pho isn't terrible, but the portions are very small. Their broth is also on the lighter side, with less cinnamon and star anise pronounced in the dish. A very average home cook can concoct this, no joke. The plate of fresh herbs was also \"limp\", for lack of a better term - which didn't make it any better. Another dish we tried was the Mì qung - you dont typically see this often. It was above average, but the noodles were under-cooked. I could go on about the appetizers, but my fingers hurt from the flowing negativity.

Eat if you must, but there are definitely better options close by."}
{"text":"The pho at this place was among the best I have experienced. The broth tasted great.  The meat was ample and tender.  The noodles were cooked just right.  Service was prompt and efficient."}
{"text":"Friend suggested a light dinner before our game and then proceeded to drive me all across town to this place. 

I've had Pho at a few places and this one takes like most of the others. They give you more meat than the rest for pretty much the same price so they have that going for them. also, When I say tastes the same, I am comparing to other really good Pho places. So there."}
{"text":"Went there to have dinner with a family of 6. Food quality has gone way down in the last few years. Service was actually bad, the staff acted arrogant. We were automatically charged a 18% service fee, seriously? I would not come back for the pho nor would I recommend this place."}
{"text":"went here for lunch with a friend as it was his recommendation. the patio was open but we were seated inside because it was occupied. my friend raved about this place because he read somewhere that it's the #1 pho in toronto. i beg to differ. i had fried spring rolls, durian milkshake and grilled pork chop on rice. the durian milkshake actually tasted like they took a full durian and blended it up...very delicious and creamy! the springrolls were alright...i didnt think it was 100% fresh as it came out immediately and the crunch factor was not there. grilled porkchop came with 1 portion of meat and I'm used to getting 2 so i thought it was small. the leafy greens that came with the dish gave it a fresh spin. the porkchop itself was a bit dry/chewy and the lemongrass flavour wasn't fully there"}
{"text":"If you come here, I'm telling you just get any pho combo and you won't be disappointed. The soup base is SO rich in flavor!! It'll definitely make you come back for some more! The summer rolls are also a must get! They make it fresh on the spot. My husband got the grilled pork vermicelli and it was also as amazing!! It comes with a grilled shrimp which you don't get in N.Y."}
{"text":"I remember coming here on a Tuesday/Wednesday night with my dad. We were downtown and I said I wanted to try this new pho place. Y'see my dad is more open to trying new restaurants whereas my mom is 'if I like this place, it's the best until they serve a cockroach on my plate' Y'know THAT kind of parent. 

So, since we were both downtown. We headed to Ossington. I read about this place on Yelp and decided to try it out. 

K first off, I was really impressed that this place was a full house on a weekday night. We waited about 5 minutes or less and I ordered a rare beef and beef ball pho and my dad ordered the same. I also wanted to try the cold rolls so I got one of those too. 

The food took longer than we expected, because we usually go to Pho Hung and the service there is always consistently fast. The rolls came first and they were good, but I was dissapointed since the rice paper was ripped! Well, I don't realy see how it could be AMAZING unless they seriously jazz it up a lot. It was a regular cold roll. Yummy, but not over-the-top-orgasmic. Soon shortly, our pho arrived. 

Damn. 'That's a lot of green' I thought to myself. 'cause it was COVERED in green onion. Anyway, I tasted the soup base and suprisingly it wasn't as overwhelming as I initially thought it'd be (from the green onion). It was pretty darn good. The soup base was very hm...how do I say this in English... like a light soup base with natural flavours. It didn't taste really concentrated, but the flavours of the green onion really gave it a settle yet flavourful soup. However, as you keep eating, those green onions start to get a bit more pungent.  I think the portion was a bit smaller than Hung's. Nonetheless this was -THE- perfect place to go because it was COLD AS HELL on the day we went. After our pho meal, we hopped over to Venezia's and grabbed ourselves 2 natas (portugese eggtarts). Delicious night!

Overall: Little less green, please!"}
{"text":"Come when it's in the afternoon. Not as busy as dinnertime. Recommendation to try the Chef Specials. Something different. Love the Middle Quang if you're not into spicy food. Great taste and good quality"}
{"text":"SAME SAME?

I'm not sure what the huge hype is over this place. We went today and it was good, but really seems completely average to me compared to the average Vietnamese place in Toronto.

The place was packed - it's certainly popular, but maybe simply because there aren't a lot of cheap alternatives in the immediate area.

We had one pho bo and one vermicelli bowl with chicken, shrimp and a spring roll. Both were tasty but I couldn't really say the pho broth was any better than most places in China town and the \"bun\" (vermicelli) dish was pretty same-same as anywhere else.

I did notice the spring roll was better than average.

Decor and service were pretty same-same too"}
{"text":"I often go phor pho with my family on the weekends, and on one such holiday Sunday, we were brought over to Golden Turtle by my semi-hipster sister (hopefully she does not read this review). 

On the bright side, Golden Turtle remained open on a weekend where several other Vietnamese establishments were closed, and the service was fast and efficient. The pho itself definitely met my standards, but did not really stand out in any particular way. One positive was that the side of basil etc. was quite fresh and fragrant. 
On the non-pho front, the pan fried beef singapore noodle, and deep fried Viet spring rolls were both good, but not memorable. 

Overall, a solid choice if you live in the area or want to warm up before a night on the Ozzy strip (note the relatively early closing hours)."}
{"text":"absolutely the WORST customer service I have EVER had.  They over charged us and then blamed it on us!  The food is only OK, certainly NOT worth the the hype!  
Do NOT eat here!"}
{"text":"Borth is tasteless. Meat is sticky. Shrimp on sugar cane are just OK. the bottle of Hoisin sauce is the good one, but what is inside is NOT the original one. Better pho anywhere else."}
{"text":"I had a decent grilled chicken with pineapple bun here. The chicken was just a tad dry, but other than that I have no complaints. The service was very fast and pleasant and the prices cheap.

I think I'll come in for the pho sometime soon as that's usually a good gauge of a quality Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"When it comes to Pho, I have high standard. I mean, common, I've been having pho since I was yeh high! I had them when I was Hong Kong, London and now mostly Toronto and areas.

Living DT, I'd say I surely missed HUEs by yonge/bloor. It's so convenient ... But now, I need to travel far and wide just to get my pho fix.

On BlogTo Golden Turtle has a pretty darn good rating. So why not try it out ... The 2nd time.  1st was after getting back from the airport ... After spending 6 days in the sea.

I'd like to say, their XL pho is huge! And if your date is also going to have pho, you might as well get he XL and share it. It's only $2 more than the small hat feeds 1 person :) 

Their spring rolls and rice wraps are a bit pricy (compare to Late Hues or Others from north of Toronto) but it wasn't bad at all. At least it's fresh :)

Highlight of the visit: XL pho deal!

{"text":"I was disappointed with Pho Hung so my friend took me to Blog TO's number 1 rated pho restaurant.
The moment I stepped into the restaurant, it felt like home.  The restaurant had a very familiar Vietnamese smell and I knew that my bowl was pho was going to be yummy.
I can't always differentiate between 2 good bowls of pho.  But, I do not when it's not good.  So, I'm happy to say that I found good pho here."}
{"text":"Went here because I wasn't feeling to well the night before and felt like having a bowl of pho. Ordered #8 large 8.75$ The broth itself was very good not very greasy and very light yet flavourful, they gave me quite a lot of beef but was a bit skimpy on the tripe. 

Overall I liked it here and will be returning."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at \"Toronto's Oldest Vietnamese Restaurant\". It was my second time there and have had generally positive experiences at Golden Turtle. I ordered three items: a durian milkshake, a plate of deep fried spring rolls (pork) shared with a friend, and a Large bowl of #14; Pho with rare beef, flank, tripe and beef balls. 

The durian milkshake was nice, as it had the right amount of sweetness, though it was not as thick as other places I have had durian milkshake at.

The spring rolls were excellent. You get three whole rolls cut in half (six pieces on the plate). The exterior was crunchy and the filling was nice and warm.

The bowl of pho was quite good, as the soup base was a high quality, decades-in-the-making, beef broth. At $9.50 for a Large bowl though, it did not have a lot of ingredients. There was maybe one beef ball cut into quarters, a couple pieces of tripe, two chunks of flank meat, and a few slices of rare beef. In the larger-sized bowl, the ingredients looked even smaller. Nonetheless, what you get is still of good quality and you leave satisfied in the end. 

The lunch crowd was a steady stream and service was quick. I'll probably be back to see how their bowls of \"bun\" or plates of \"com\" are like."}
{"text":"I recommend asking \"is this a phallic item?\" while ordering here since a number of things come rolled up - including an ambiguous \"pork\" item which is more like a hot dog wrapped in lettuce wearing an edible condom (patent pending). 

But don't let that dissuade you! 
Their soups are great; their egg noodles confusing to eat but delicious. 
In general the menu's a happy marriage of eternal life stews and cardiac arrest platters. 

Forever turtle."}
{"text":"After watching a very confusing \"The Last Airbender\" (very little made sense and the plot holes were about the size the giant flying dog beaver -- what was that thing????), my friends and I came here for dinner to figure out what the *?&$!!@% we watched. 

We chowed down on pho, vermicelli, and spring rolls/egg rolls (In Canada, egg rolls are called spring rolls. In the US, spring rolls are an entirely different beast, which have translucent UNFRIED flour wrappers around lettuce, rice noodles, and shrimp.) The vermicelli that my friends ordered looked delicious. 

I had a small bowl of pho tai (rare beef). The broth was lighter than what I'm used to. It still had good flavor, but I would have preferred a heavier body. Unlike most broths that I found excessively salty, this broth wasn't. It was perfectly seasoned and I didn't have to drown myself with glasses of water afterwards. The noodles were very good. The meat was tender. And I loved all the scallions that they put into the soup. 

The spring rolls/egg rolls were the best spring rolls/egg rolls that I've ever had in my life. The crunchy wrapper wasn't overfried, which makes biting into the egg roll rather difficult. Instead, the wrapper gave way nicely and provided a great texture against the juicy filling that I loved. It was very flavorful with bits of shrimp and pork and probably other stuff.

3.5* for the pho.
5*s for the egg rolls/spring rolls

4*s overall"}
{"text":"highly regarded as one of the top pho places in toronto, i would have to concur. It's really all about the pho broth. A perfect balance: not bland but not concentrated. Most pho places over use msg and other ingredients and keep the broth way too rich. Rua Vang perfected the broth. everything else in the soup taste better because well you can actually taste what's in the soup and not a mouth full of sodium.  

BTW, the Mississauga location of the same name is not related to this review"}
{"text":"The food is super cheap! I mean like 12.00$ for a XL bowl of Pho!(about 9.00$ in USD) I love the Pho for this place! Be careful of the steep stairs to the bathroom XD"}
{"text":"I came to Rua Vang try the Pho based on the reviews of all your fellow yelpers. It is also convenient for me because it is right across from Yoga Space so I dropped by after one of my yoga class.

It was a rainny Monday night when I was there. The place was still quite busy.

 I orded the Large Pho with Raw Beef. Usually I order small size but the price difference here is only 50 cents. I am glad that I order the large.. because the large is like a small in other places I been too. 

My noodle was ready so fast! It appeared on my table within 1 minute after I ordered!! Gee.. This is faster than eating at Fast food place. The soup was nice and hot.. with tons of green onions. 2 to 3 times more than any other places I been to. 

I would go back to eat at Rua Vang again... But I might have to order the XL size  (XL I sounded like a pig!) or something else on the side. But the Large size is good as a snack.

CASH only"}
{"text":"Since I've found this place, I can't go anywhere else for pho. I always order #1, rare beef and #112 vegetarian spring rolls. They're by far, the best spring rolls on earth. The food is delicious, service is fast. They're always busy so they rush and they're not super friendly, but I never had issues with my orders. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Susur Lee, Susur Lee, Susur Lee. Golden Turtle loooooves to brag about Susur loving their restaurant. And all the young urban professionals love to follow the hype down Ossington, because everyone wants so desperately to love Ossington even though it still isn't anything extraordinary...

Ossington is not the point. The point is that Golden Turtle isn't phenomenal. It's good. The one main thing I like about it is that they have a good vegetarian pho alternative, which they actually use a vegan broth for, instead of using beef broth to cook your veggies. They use a huge amount of fresh vegetables, and a nice assortment that offers something more. The one thing I didn't like as much was the sweetness of the broth -- I found it had a strangely sweet taste to it that didn't taste right.

As for their beef pho, I've had better and continue to have better pho. I haven't had any of their non-pho menu except the spring rolls, which were nothing to brag about. Their cuts of meat were sometimes a bit fatty and stringy, and while the broth was alright, I didn't fall in love with it.

The staff there have always been attentive and nice, so it's nothing against them. It's a decent choice if you like trying different kinds of pho and especially if  want to read all the Susur Lee references in the newspaper clippings pinned to the walls.

Plus it's usually pretty busy. In the summer the patio was packed every time I walked by, and the 4 or 5 times I've been there, it's only been quiet once.

And honestly, there is an even better place down the street, closer to Queen. Pho Tien Than wins my heart. Sorry, Susur."}
{"text":"While I can't consider myself a pho connoisseur, I have been to Golden Turtle several times with friends and have never been disappointed.

The staff are friendly, service is quick and prices are very hard to beat, especially considering its famous reputation. My order has rarely deviated from the Beef Pho and I have yet to be disappointed - rich soup broth is met with ginger, herbs and delicious beef. With the added chili and hoisin sauce it's hardly low-sodium, but thankfully water refills come regularly.

Definitely worth the visit if you're looking for some great Vietnamese or you find yourself on the west end of Toronto!"}

Will NOT come back

There are more places for better and cheaper."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review, it ended up being pho! Unfortunately I can only give the golden turtle one star. I think this is fair because the service just cannot compete with other pho resteraunt a in Toronto. Customer service is very important to me, especially in the food industry! 

     The food that my group had ordered included deep fried viet sausage. Having tried this plate before at other places I knew it was a delicious appetizer. The plate delivered however was extra crispy (which is great) along with an uncooked sausage (the bad). Our entree was chicken and beef pho. The presentation looked great from a far. Huge bowls making it look as if the portions were a fair size. Upon receiving our pho we noticed that the broth took up more room than the noodles and meat.

     My overall experience at The golden Turtle can only allow me to give a 1 star."}
{"text":"I'm from CA so I know what Authentic Pho tastes like. Of course it's way up there my taste bud. Better yet, I am Viet so I know how my country real food taste like. This is cater to only Americans as they would not know. I see a lot of Americans come here. Asian? You should go elsewhere. This place is definitely not authentic Pho. I also asked for Onion vinegar - every Pho waters know what they are. It's just raw onion adding a bit of sugar + vinegar and mix it up. How hard can this be?  They brought out vinegar but unable to mix Onion + vinegar with a spoon of sugar. Bad customer service. They came out and said it's not done here. Therefore I was gonna order more food to go but due to the lack in flavor of broth and tastes like hot boil water pour over noodles with no flavor of Pho , vey lacking and couldn't do a simple Onion vinegar as requested so I skipped the to go and take my money elsewhere. Will not come back. And of course not gonna finish this bland bowl of Pho. 

Some restaurants really shouldn't stay open and deserves your service once!"}
{"text":"This gets a buuuuump! Because I went last week and I'm still thinking about the spring rolls.

Vietnamese food is not my fave, but I've come here a lot because...the world seems to disagree with me.

Things I like (pho-k yes!):
- iced coffee with condensed milk
- summer rolls are awesome (shrimp, please!) but especially so because the dipping sauce is delightfully fresh and chock-a-block full of crushed nuts
- the classic pho broth
- vermicelli buns are my go-to, and the grilled pork / spring roll combo is my particular favourite. The fried spring rolls are...AMAZING. Yeah, caps. I WENT THERE.

Things I don't like (pho-k no!)
- their \"crispy pork skin\" is not like crackling, it's terrible and gelatinous rubber bands. I'm sure it appeals to some, but for most: not worth the additional add-on
- the non-Vietnamese options (see: some Thai go-tos) help diversify the menu but have never been home runs for me

Yelp note: good for take-out. Pretty sure, if I remember correctly: cash only?"}
{"text":"Golden Turtle is definitely my first choice for Viet food and I try to make it out to the west end whenever I have the luxury.

1) Their quick and efficient.  Even when there's a line out the door, which they often do, they work through the line quickly.  The food comes out as quickly as 10 minutes!

2) The pho broth is tasty.  I have been there for over 8 years and it has always been good.  My boyfriend and I often find ourselves craving the broth but the restaurant is a little far from where we live.  

3) Clean.  Those who know me, know I don't like public washrooms but I do not cringing here.

This place has the best pho in Toronto and I have been to many in my lifetime."}

{"text":"My SO really enjoys the grill chicken bun (vermicelli) here however I'm impartial to the food. The pho is only ok, and I find the spring rolls greasy. The service is garbage, I know I can't expect friendly hospitable service, but sheesh they take efficient service and cross the line to rude territory for me.  can I have a minute to finish my tea please?? AND I saw them give the menus to the ppl at the door before even getting a seat...i get that they want to speed up turnover, but it shouldn't be at the price of hospitality, service, and enjoying time out with friends/family."}
{"text":"I have to preface my review by saying I've never actually had regular (meat) pho, so my first pho experience was a vegetarian one, so I don't have anything to compare it to - I'm sure some purists may argue that this doesn't even approach a 'true pho experience'!!

The vegetarian (actually, it's vegan) pho comes in one size (large) and it's only $6 - astounding. It's an obscene amount of soup to conquer. The bowl is filled with green onions, broccoli, rice noodles and deep fried tofu. The broth is incredibly savoury and addictive. I ate until my stomach couldn't handle it anymore and I had only plowed through about 50% of my soup (I took the rest home with me).

I also ordered a Soursop Shake. Soursop is a bizarre tropical fruit with a taste that's often compared to strawberry, pineapple, citrus and coconut. Truly unique and recommended!

Also: Don't make the mistake of showing up hungry on a Tuesday night, cause you'll be turned away! They're closed!"}
{"text":"So I was just shopping on Queen West and ended up near Ossington so thought I'd try this place.

It was 3:30 so I thought I'd just saunter in and have the place to myself but it was PACKED.

Ordered the pho with rare beef and tendon. It was decent. The noodles were no better or worse than down the street at Tien Thanh. I found the broth at Tien Thanh slightly more flavourful. There was hardly any tendon though. (When the pho first landed on my table, I went scouring through the noodles and beef looking for a yummy glutinous glob of tendon and actually had to search hard to find one!)

The beef was well done and too dry. I like my beef pink in the middle. I don't know what happened here - I ordered #5 so it's not like there was some miscommunication.

If I end up in the neighbourhood again and get a pho craving, I'd likely go over to Tien Thanh. If I feel like experimenting and ordering something new, I might go back to Golden Turtle and order whatever they're good at."}
{"text":"All this talk about \"best pho in Toronto\" is surely an exaggeration.  It's not my favorite, but I accept that there are subtle differences in every kitchen.  Rua Vang is not bad, you can't go wrong with pho.  The non-pho dishes leave a little to be desired, so don't get your hopes up if you're planning to skip the soup.

One extra star for them is for the patio, in the summer it's the perfect spot to relax and cool off (get a milkshake to double down on the experience).

And if you're ever back in the area for a second round, try Pho Tien Thanh instead, a block south.  I say they're better, but of course opinions are divided."}
{"text":"I have never reviewed Golden Turtle? Are you kiddddding me. I have had more take out pho and BBQ pork with rice from here than I care to recount. 

Recently, I popped in for a sit down meal with myself, a man and a tiny baby in a clip-on high chair. They were super nice about our awkward stroller maneuvering, and the warm Vietnamese goodness was as great as it always has been. If the cold has you down their pho ga is sure to fire you up."}
{"text":"1 star for how rude everyone there is. They behave as they have done you some favour. The food is not the best and they are not the only Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best Vietnamese (and most authentic) place in Toronto!!!

Coming from Montreal where excellent Vietnamese restos are easily found, my tongue recognizes good phos and buns!!! 

What's nice was I tried something new this time.... Had a Vietnamese omelette with pork and shrimp wrapped in lettuce as appetizer (yumza). Then tasted the pho (decent), curry friend vermicelli with beef (not bad), and grilled pork bun (delight!!). Oh and a refreshing mango smoothie, hmmmm!!!!

Small resto and not a fancy place but totally enjoyable experience for small groups of four or less....

Two thumbs up, baby!!!"}
{"text":"They may have changed their broth. The last time we went, there was zero flavor in the pho broth. We also mentioned to the owner that we thought it was bland, and she got really defensive and told us that this is the way she's made the broth for over 20 years. We heard another table mention that they thought their broth was a little lacking that day. Maybe it was just that day?

It totally didn't fulfill my pho craving so I went to another pho place 2 hours later."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was meh.

Service is always meh at pho places though, at least the good ones! Super cheap prices though.

Cash only!! Heads up 

They also have a patio

Great location"}
{"text":"Lost count of how many times I've been here but whenever the craving strikes for Viet food, Golden Turtle answers the bell."}
{"text":"It was okay. Not the best I've ever had. It wasn't horrible. Just didn't have a lot of flavor to it. I did like that the spring rolls came with 3, the usual is 2. The peanut sauce was lacking in my opinion. My friends who also ate here really liked the bun. The prices were got and there was a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"Just ate here, and the spring roll wasn't great, it seems the oil maybe burnt, and the rice noodle bowl wasn't great, may go back to the place I use to go to. It is close to where I live, but I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Great Viet.   Highly recommend the Fresh Herbed beef spring rolls.   Pho is high quality and rivals the best spots in the city too.
