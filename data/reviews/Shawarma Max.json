{"text":"Do not eat here. They use styrofoam in microwave!! When we asked them whether they know it is cancerous, the staff said \"yes\" and he said \"boss told him to do it this way\"!!! They know it is a health hazard, but they still do it! So disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop by after the bar.  I always get the same shawarma sandwich so I that's all I can recommend."}
{"text":"Great quick service. Good delicious food. Nothing fancy but a great place to pick up some food."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, wish they gave more chicken. Paid like $5.75 for the Shawarma Chicken Sandwhich. Barely any chicken meat in there"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were hungry really late at night and we were having a Harold and Kumar's White Castle moment. So happy this place opens until 4am on Saturday! Noticed a lot of guys coming in for the chicken schwarma too! 

We both goth chicken schwarma. Perhaps I didn't add enough sauce and spreads to my wrap, but I still thought the chicken was on the drier side. My last criticism is that they could have mixed/spread the vegetables and meat together more evenly. 

Overall, a good place to stop by and grab a late night meal! I loved all the yummy fresh, crispy vegetables in my wrap! This beats McDonald and Popeyes lol"}
{"text":"Just tried it tonight and first shawarma in Toronto, had many good kebabs in the middle east and other countries before. I ordered their famous chicken shawarma plate, very very generous portion, included were chicken, rice, salad and sauces, like others said they dont skim on anything including the shaved chicken! They grill the chicken once more after shaving before giving it to you, it was rather dry, some bits were even crisp, thats how dried, but definitely edible. The were many sauces to choose from i opted for all of them and all the toppings. The sauces were meh, not enough flavour, they all feels like mayo and just pure fat. One thing I would suggest is that they change the sauce! Rice and salad were very good, i dont know if i could swap the rice with fries or not as i think that would taste even better! There is no service, just like a takeout shop so dont expect anything. Overall, i give 3.8 stars, is not THAT great that i would miss it but i will come again to try their rolls. Very cheap prices and large portion, thats a plus!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times because its convenient due to the location of the area. The service and quality of food is extremely disappointing as chicken was their only option since they burned their beef. Friends and I went to the location at Yonge and Sheppard area for some 12am shwarma and the next morning all of us were planted on the toilets for hours to come due to food poisoning. To be honest, I'm actually writing this review on the toilet because I have been stuck inside my washroom for hours. The pain in my stomach feels like needles jabbing my stomach from the inside and the outside and it is extremely upsetting because no restaurant should be serving food thats been contaminated or has gone bad. I hope this establish steps up its' game."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. The pita was soggy, the toppings weren't fresh- lettuce was wilted and very old looking. The falafel is left out what tasted like all day and microwaved instead of being fresh cooked. Just terrible."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The shwarma's are beyond amazing taste. I always get good service and have been a regular customer for years. The sauces they use is what make it special. Always juicy and full of flavour. Get it with black olives and feta a must."}
{"text":"The food is good and the price is great. There are two Shawarma Max(es) within a few blocks of each other. This one is a bit of a dive on the inside but the food seems to be consistently better. The other one, a little north of here, has a fast-food squeaky-clean atmosphere but the food id not as good. for under $10 you walk away feeling like you ate well in every respect."}
{"text":"Probably amongst one of the worst places I've been to. The only good thing about this place is location. I hate eating mcds but I'd rather pick that over this place. They have the best mango juice thou haha"}
{"text":"Best shawarma for the price and quality! These guys used to be pretty bad a couple of years back but i guess maybe management has changed or something but i am deff hooked! The chicken is always juicy and fresh - The reason being is that they have lots of customers and when they are slow they turn down the roaster on the spike and when they get a rush of customers they turn it back on and make sure u get fresh juicy meat right off the spike!"}
{"text":"I have never walked into this place before 1am so my judgment could be a little clouded on this but this place always does the job. The service is super quick which is really important for impatient drunks on a Saturday night. The shawarmas are reasonably priced and consistently good and you can always find a seat regardless of what time you walk in. As strange as it sounds, they play some of the best electronic music at Shawarma Max which for me is a huge draw. Watching your sandwich get assembled to the sound of Tiesto is definitely something worth experiencing."}
{"text":"My friends and I got some chicken shawarma here. 

I'd rate this higher, but mine tasted burned. The ones my friends had seemed fine though. 

The guy behind the counter was quite friendly. It was a cool night, but the restaurant was quite hot inside. They have outdoor seating though. Great for people watching.

$5 shawarma and $2 pop make for a cheap dinner option in the area. I'd come here again to give their shawarma another chance because of the friendly service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here (take out) multiple times and it's a solid place to cure your shawarma craving at the Yonge and Sheppard area. 

Really not much to nit pick at here - portions are very generous and the chicken is tasty. It's a a bit bland/dry on its own, but that's what the garlic and hot sauces are for."}
{"text":"I always go to Shawarma Max. It's one of my favourite places that sell it actually and I will continue to go here because it's delicious everytime. 

I usually just take out to eat but they do have a patio outside for seating as well as inside.

Craving one now actually hahaha"}
{"text":"OK food when they give you meat that is not dry and hard. Horrible service - the guy who works at the yonge and empress location definitely is partial to female customers."}
{"text":"OMG, you know that feeling you get when something brings you such joy that you want to shout it from a mountain top? Shawarma Max is giving me such joy at the moment that I need to shout it out between bites!

I walked into Shawarma Max starving this evening, knowing full well what I needed before this day would end. It had been one hell of a long day and I had no patience for anything so I parked illegally and marched in to get some take-out, my usual: chicken shawarma plate. Their portions are already pretty huge and the food is always fresh, even if you may not get that impression when you first walk in, but I think they ran out of the usual dinner-sized containers by the time I showed up because today I got double the amount of food in two containers!! YUM! I sped down the highway trying to get home while the smell of my dinner stank up my car, but in a good way. Man, was it ever worth the wait--and still warm when I opened up the bag. Everything was just perfect.

I don't have a lot of faith when it comes to shawarmas in this town, and it's a shame given the enormous Middle Eastern population. Every nation does things a bit differently, but I like how they do things at Shawarma Max. Tons of fresh food and all the right flavours. One reviewer mentioned the chicken is lacking flavour, but I never noticed that. Maybe because I always get my platter with the different sauces? I normally don't like it when the meat is grilled off the spit but I don't mind it at SM because it comes out with just the right amount of crisp on some edges and those crispy parts enhance the flavours of the spices. One reviewer mentioned that they sometimes forget to pack up the pita and I've actually had this happen so I always remind them. It's such a travesty not to have the pita with the platter! It's not that they try to rip you off a pita bread, I think they just forget. I probably would too if I had to stand behind a counter all day, enduring the smell and heat from the grill and spit.

The guys that work here are always super nice and accommodating (I always take mine as it comes but I've overheard other customers with their no this and no that, etc.), and I really appreciate that. I always wondered what nationality they were as I couldn't figure it out during previous visits and it turns out they're Turkish, which explains a lot, but not why they don't call it 'doner' instead of shawarma--maybe people recognize the latter moreso than the former? Whatever the case, it's good. 

To some people a shawarma is just a shawarma, kind of the way a rose is a rose is a rose--WRONG! I had some pretty crappy doner when I was in Istanbul, but I'm guessing it was because I had it in the touristy area of Sultanahmet and no one gave a damn. Shawarmas and doners are such a common street/snack food in Europe that it's actually hard to find a shitty one out there otherwise. I've not visited Germany yet, where the Turkish population is pretty huge, but I will say the best doner I've had to date? *GUESS!* In France! Believe it!

So while there are no mountains nearby, it's a bit cold out so I'm not even going to take this one to the streets--just Yelpin' it. If you're in the area and craving something tasty and filling, I suggest you stop by with about $12 in cash or a debit card because that's all they take. It's also open late (someone needs to update the hours for this place in the right side!). I've not been to the one just south of this location, but then I don't feel the need to."}
{"text":"From someone who eats shawarmas at least once or twice every month, take it from me that this place has the worst shawarma I've had in Canada.  
Well, ok, not worst, as there are places that gave me upset stomachs afterward, and this place, in all fairness, never has. 

Why did I go to this place the dozen times that I have?  because people from the office would go there on occasion, and I'd join them for convenience.

Positives about this place?  
-cheap shawarma
-can sit outside
-open late.

Negatives?  
-Shawarma is terrible...they cut it off the skewer before it's ready, then fry it on a hotplate with lots of greasy, tasteless results.  The only thing that gives their shawarma taste is their thina and the hot sauce.
-pitas are the cheap, paper-thin variety.  they use them as a wrap, not as a pita 'pocket' style.
-falafel actually is worse than the shawarma (I think they make it in the morning, and just serve it throughout the day)
-owner (or one of the owners?), when he works, has 0 customer service skills.  not pleasant to deal with

The fact that this place is around proves the mantra 'location-location-location'.

Oh, and I find it suspicious that there are so many positives reviews below."}
{"text":"This is the best i have ever eaten in Toronto. Delicious and Halal the workers are so kind."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE food and service. Do not come here!! 

To make it short, the guy who served me had an extremely rude attitude and then proceeded to charged me $10 for EACH shawarma. Yes, this guy was trying to rip me off even after I questioned him about it. $20 for 2 shawarma sandwiches? To top if off when I got back into my car with the food, I realized he didn't even toast the shawarma and the whole thing was cold including the meat (luke warm). It was the most disgusting service and food I ever had.

I came here late at night and it was either this or McDonald's. I wish I had McDonald's instead of this garbage. Fyi: I used to eat here few years ago, so I thought I might pay this place a visit since I was in the area and WOW has food and service gone down."}
{"text":"okay so I have to give full disclosure before I write this reviews. I was craving chicken on rice (like the kind you can get in NYC on the streets) and came here.

the food was good, and the portion is huge! I had the chicken plate that came with rice and a salad. 

the chicken was okay, it didn't have the flavour and kick I was looking for but it wasn't bad. came here right before the lunch rush! 

I think next time I might try a wrap instead so that I'm not wasting food. 

the service was great, they took the time to serve customers even though there was a line, not a typical fast food joint."}
{"text":"love this place! they have the best baklava that i have ever tasted! its drenched in honey and fresh.

we got two meat platters one with chicken and one with beef and i highly recommend both."}
{"text":"Chicken smells so bad...not fresh at all. I stopped going there, it was right in front of my house though."}
{"text":"The shawarma tasted a bit dry and the salad included with the plate was not sufficient. The wrap didn't taste fresh either. However, the food tasted great since I was starving at the time."}
{"text":"I give it a four star for their portion and business hours . Their sharwama plate are surely big enough to serve 2 ppl. Flavor is okay."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place for almost a year and went to it today, and was walking as usual when I took my first bite. Wham! Then I remember why I like this place so much.

I love shawarmas and most places are pretty much the same. But there is something about the way they make it here that it just tastes amazing."}
{"text":"it's a small shawarma place packed between office and condo buildings. 
there is a tiny patio facing the sidewalk with cheap plastic tables and chears.

my colleagues rave about this place due to low prices and friendly service. And I should say that it's true the people working there are always friendly and the falafal I always get is always great tasting and it's only $4.50 or something like that.

it's food worth your money.
and a great runaway place for lunch breaks."}
{"text":"I used to love this place a lot when it first opened 10 years ago. Quality has declined heavily. I would much rather drive to Toonie pizza at bathurst and finch and get 2 for one special for much bulkier and tasty shawarma. Mi va mi is still the best shawarma styles restaurant in this area!"}
{"text":"I always get the Shawarma Plate.  It is quick, consistent, and always delicious.  In the plate you get white rice, chicken or beef or both if you request it, salad, and Pita bread. Make sure you remind them of the pita bread that comes with the plate combo...they seem to sometimes forget.

I enjoy the fresh chicken and salad ingredients.  It makes me feel full and hearty everytime I eat it.  Go here for a quick and plentiful bite!"}
{"text":"$10 for a chicken plate and $6 for a chicken wrap. Quick. Fast. Somewhat healthy... but oh sssooo good! Open super late on those drunken nights and is always ready to eat.  I go here at least once a week and I am addicted to this stuff.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rating - Great local shawarma place at Yonge and Sheppard! I like their daily specials :) it's a good place to grab a quick bite to eat whether it be lunch or late night! I do find that the portions size can vary depending on who is serving you but overall, I've had good experiences here."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the shwarma  but noticed the maker was sniffling. No problem, just a cold probably. But I'm sorry, I just had to walk out after he coughed right into my sandwich as he was making it. I don't think he was wearing gloves either.. saw a comment below saying they got sick after eating there so I'm glad I just walked out after seeing that."}
{"text":"I was in the nearby area for a major dentist appointment. I knew I couldn't eat well for the rest of the day, so I wanted something very tasty and filling. Upon my yelp research, Shawarma Max stuck out on top.

The restaurant is quite spacey, both indoor and the outdoor patio. It comes at a cost though. It would be nearly impossible to keep the restaurant at a decent A/C temperature without spending a fortune on a commercial grade A/C and getting raped by electricity bill.

The meat was on the shawarma grills and the rest of the items were kept in a cool salad bar. It's probably not unreasonable to be concerned about the health of the food items as it was sharing warm air with the restaurant, 

I was the first and the only customer when I walked in at around 5pm (Wednesday), but about a dozen savvy customers came through within the next 15 minutes I spent munching in the patio.

I was very glad to have been greeted by Kadir the Turkish boy who was very attentive and genuinely interested in responding to my curiosity of Shawarma and its history. I asked for his best Shawarma and and boy did it taste amazing (Chicken shawarma). There was 'magic' in his touch and mix of the food items delivered to my senses.

FYI, no credit cards are accepted here; there's a surcharge of $0.50 for using the debit machine.

I am definitely going back for more. Next time, I want to try the brother and sister toppings that Kadir left out, to satisfy my curiosity. Perhaps my quirky palate would like them!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend had just gotten our lashes done, and we were told about this place through the lady at the salon. We were really hungry and wanted something quick. We ordered two chicken shawarma wraps. At first I had not noticed the fruit flies flying around. The topping aren't cover with lids. After we had gotten our wraps, the chicken was cold and the whole wrap didn't taste good. We ended up throwing the rest out."}
{"text":"Not the best shawarma for sure. In fact, I was not too thrilled with mine. I ordered a chicken shawarma plate. I don't think the portion is large for the price. It's just OK. 

The salad stuff is standard and I'm not too picky about that. My main problem was that the chicken was largely tasteless without sauce. This...and my shawarma had some chicken skin. Most importantly, I thought the whole point of shawarma is to thin slice the chicken so the exterior is continually being grilled to the right texture. My shawarma didn't have the texture I was looking for. I guess it wasn't cooked long enough. Maybe I had a few people order before me and they didn't wait to shave more meat. It was still edible of course. I don't mean to imply the chicken was undercooked to the point it was raw. I like my shawarma a little dry and slightly hardened. 

My favourite shawarma is actually at Messini but they call it gyros."}
{"text":"\"Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.\" - Tony Stark (Iron Man),  in the movie The Avengers. 

That quote from the movie IS pretty much how I felt when I wanted to digest a piping hot, filled with tender pieces of roasted seasoned chicken, lathered in yoghurt sauce, with tahini spread across the warm soft pita,  with crunchy radish pickles, fresh tomatoes and crispy lettuce: YUM!

After my last shawarma experience over the course of the summer (please reference my review for Maz Maz Shawarma), I was still not satisfied and I wanted something GOOD. Shawarma Max was IT and this my friends, was GOOD! The line was long during lunch hour, and the counter where they cook and prepare the shawarmas is pretty much right near the entrance door, which makes it a bit of an inconvenience in terms of the line/getting in and out. Well worth the wait which seems pretty non-existent once your asked what you want. Prices? Good. 

Summing up: Definitely followed through on Tony Stark's (Iron Man's) quote and I did indulge in a shawarma, and it WAS good. So, BOO-YEAH! A happy belly=smiles across ma face! ; )"}
{"text":"A lunchtime staple if you're in the area. Whenever I try a shawarma place, I always compare it to the food here. I always get a shawarma plate to go, and for $10.51 taxes in, it's some of the best value you can get. Ask for a piece of pita to go with it and they'll oblige for free.

I've also tried the pita sandwiches. If it's not too busy, ask them to heat up the sandwich on the flat top, the extra flavour is amazing!

IMO, the chicken is better than the beef as I think beef tastes dryer. 

Don't forget the tahini and extra hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I always go there when I'm in the area and craving shawarma. Especially when its late night and everything else is closed. I always stick with chicken shawarma and am too hesitant to try anything else. It does taste fresh and juicy. Decent price. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just got back from having a scrumptious plate of chicken schwarma served with veggies and 3 sauces (garlic, tahini, and something else). The chicken was tender and yummy. I was completely satisfied after a long day of work :D Check it out!"}
{"text":"The food there was really good. I ordered the beef shawarma plate for take out and they gave it to me in less than 5 minutes. They do take credit card but do charge a 50cent surcharge if u use debit or credit card so next time better to pay cash. Will come again."}
{"text":"My go to spot to get a huge meal to go at a decent price! Their chicken shawarma plate is GINORMOUS..  I mean, they don't skimp on anything! Along with the pita that they throw in as well, it is one tasty meal.  Their stuff shouldn't set you back for more tha $9 which is a steal.

I usually go here on my days where I train.. it covers all the bases for me.. carbs.. check. Meat? Ch-check!  Fat CH-CHCHECK. :D"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I came here wanting to buy a chicken shawarma. When I got there and placed my order, he put the chicken on the grill and began making my pita. He asked me what I wanted in the sandwich and I said hummus, lettuce, tomatoes and tahina ONLY. He repeated it to me and I confirmed that was exactly correct. Upon making my sandwich, he adds hot sauce to it and I tell him no hot sauce. It's already in the sandwich so I tell him I can't eat hot sauce and politely asked for another. He told me \"what am I going to do with this one? Throw it away?\" And I told him many times I don't like hot sauce and I'm not going to pay for something I don't like. Upon attempting to argue with me and convince me to buy this sandwich I didn't like, I walked out. BEWARE DONT BOTHER WITH THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!! There are plenty of delicious food along Yonge St with way better service!"}
{"text":"I ate shawarma plate, it was good taste, but next day had a terrible abdominal pain I had to stay home, due to vomiting and diarrhea. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Inconsistent quality depending on the server, sometimes amazing, most of the time average."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, open late, excellent value, and good attitude behind the counter - what more do you want?

Not gourmet, sit down food but a whole lot better taste and health than the McD's or Tim's across the street."}
{"text":"Worst shawarma in the gta. Food quality is poor, food is not fresh, assortment also limited. Attitude from the staff is mediocre, like they don't want to be there. Price is the same as everywhere else that serves good shawarma, keep driving!"}
{"text":"I don't eat a lot of shawarma, but Shawarma Max has converted me. Tasty food with quick service in a clean restaurant with friendly services. The restaurant is handy, situated on Yonge between Empress and Sheppard. The parking is a downer, as most of the time you'll find yourself dropping some coins into a street meter, which is worth it, trust me, as the green hornets swarm this part of Yonge looking to hand out tickets. I've been here twice and now I crave the food, especially the hot sauce which has some heat but doesn't overwhelm. Look to pay about $6 for a delicious chicken shawarma, complete with mostly fresh toppings (the lettuce was slightly wilted and a little brown each time I went). I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Doesn't compare to Villa Madina in the food courts. I crave for shwarma once in a while and always hoping to get that same flavour combination I get from Villa Madina; fresh salads, pickled veggies, hummus, garlic sauce, etc. This one was a disappointment and I felt gross after eating it. All the sauces melded together and the chicken was not tender. It was one hot mess. Oh, and the interior is super ghetto."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst shawarma place I've ever been to. The guy who served me at the counter was just short of rude. Maybe he was having a crappy day or something but he could've at least attempted to be nice. The other guy behind the counter actually did smile and ask how I was. The two stars are for him :)

The shawarma was not seasoned well and the rice was horribly waterlogged. The sauces were terrible and added almost no flavour - even the hot sauce wasn't hot. The hummus was watery and tasted like nothing. Everything else was just boring salad ingredients. What happened to serving tabouleh with shawarma? Perhaps it's specific to Vancouver to serve it that way, but in any case, I'll certainly not bother giving this mediocre place another shot. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Pretty good by Toronto standards, but nowhere near Montreal quality.  Just had a sandwich from here tonight, have been here several times in the past..  The chicken itself has a pretty good flavor, but the wilted lettuce and sorry looking toppings always have me disappointed, and somehow there were fruit flies buzzing around all the veggies even though it's -4 degrees out..  Some little adjustments could make this place alot better, simple things like unwilted lettuce and grilling the pita instead of leaving it straight-from-the-bag and soggy would do them some good.  3 out of 5 for Toronto"}
{"text":"got a chicken shawarma sandwich
taste was pretty good
stomach issues 2 hrs later though"}
{"text":"I've had some good shawarmas and I've had some bad ones......but what's been consistent is that the tahini sauce has always in the past ended up bringing me pretty close to throwing up.  I always thought it was an allergy or something, but today's snack broke that trend.  We were dropping one of our cousins off at the subway and my other cousin took the 4 of us here and told us they had the best chicken shawarma sandwiches around (they were wraps, not sandwiches, but that's what they're called).  I was skeptical, but agreed to give it a shot....just as long as they put a lot of hot sauce on mine in addition to whatever else they use, and that I get a side of hot sauce so I can adjust the heat as needed.  He wasn't playing around........this is BY FAR the best shawarma I've EVER had!!!
  I gotta give this place 4 1/2 stars because they didn't have fries to go w/ the shawarma, but because the food was so good and all of their meat is Halal, I'll round up to 5 stars.  I'll be back here everytime I'm in the toronto area."}
{"text":"Best, inexpensive, high quality shawarma sandwich I tried so far... Thumbs up! 

The place is ordinary, nothing fancy except the food itself."}
{"text":"I've come here several times to grab takeout (chicken shawarma) and I like it. There appears to be other Shawarma Max's in the neighbourhood as well.

When you walk in, it feels like a takeout joint with only a few tables against the left wall. I find the price to be a bit higher than places I've been to before (i.e., along Lawrence Ave. in Scarborough). It's approx. $6 per shawarma.

They provide a good amount of meat, veggies, and pickled veggies. They also provide a good amount of non-spicy and spicy sauce, which makes it extra flavourful. The only thing I wish they did was using a panini machine to make it a bit crispy like many other shawarma places."}
{"text":"The smell when you walk in is amazing but the shawarma itself never seems to measure up.  I've tried both the chicken and beef thinking that maybe I was picking the wrong kind of meat.  Doesn't seem to be the case so the next logical thing to try is to get a mix of the two.

Good prices for a quick and tasty lunch.  They have fries on their menu board, but don't actually have fries.  That's a little disappointing, because despite the shawarma being more than enough food on its own, it would really be supplemented well with a side of fries.  But then what doesn't get better with a side of fries?"}
{"text":"Its probably among the best Ive had in Toronto. Its also Halal, which is not so easy to come by in walking distance of the YandS area. The meat is fresh and never dry.  Its open from lunch to pretty late at night and always satisfies the tummy."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Shawarma Max.

I ordered a chicken shawarma.  There were lots of veggies to choose from along with spreads and sauces.  Since I'm not a big veggie fan I just got tomatoes and but ordered extra chicken (for an extra cost) along with a garlic mayo and tahini.  It came to about $12 with a pop.  It was really good!  After they cut the chicken off the post, they put it on a grill to I guess heat it up more.  I'd go back and get this again."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Shwarma, however I find their food to be a very low quality meats and not terribly tasty -it is definitely my least favorite Schwarma place that I have tried in all of the GTA. I would never return here again. I was embarrassed I had brought my family to eat here.  There are much better restaurants in this area. I'm surprised it's still open."}
{"text":"We stop by here every time we drive by!

The shawarma is moist and flavourful, balanced nicely with the pickles and sauces.  It's a great fast food joint, cheap, cheerful and friendly."}
{"text":"Shawarma run after a workout at the Goodlife Madison across for when you're sick of sushi and kalbi! 

This location has great hours and the guys are quick and service is wonderful, falafel you like??!! Get some hummus and hot sauce on those to assist the digestion of la chicken of Arabia with all the toppings my good sir!

Hubby went adventurous yet again and tried the yogurt drink, almost barfed as he keeps forgetting that even our little girl's daninos had him turned off at first taste. Stick with the fizzy drinks as this yogurt drink was the REAL yogurt, without the fruits and sugar to accompany the soury attack it gives the taste buds. 

One suggestion would be is to get the shawarma toasted a bit longer for the crunch, but all in all great quality!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times, but this is my first official yelp visit.

Whemever I come in, I order a simple shawarma in pita which usually costs about $7.00 including tax. In my experience, it has mostly been a positive experience at Shawarma Max. There have been 1 or 2 times where the food came out dry but all other times the meat is juicy and tasty. Usually..atleast in my experience during late night visits... when you come in, you have the choice of either chicken or beef depending on what they have cooking. it's a little bit unfortunate, but luckily both of their meats are great. My personal preference, however, is beef.  

Today, my shawarma turmed out very well as they usually do. The chicken, which can be hard to cook, was definitely not dry. Credit is due to the cook who didn't overcook the meat on the grill. For some, it can be a sketchy area during the night hours but if you don't mind its really not too bad. 

Its a far drive for me to come down here, but its always worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first and it will be my last visit to this particular Shawarma Max location. Service was quick and friendly. You can choose from hummus, hot sauce, tzatziki sauce or tahini sauce. I got a falafel sandwich and it was okay.

I won't return to this location though, because one of my dining companions found a huge, dead fly in his chicken shawarma sandwich. After seeing that, I was disgusted and could not finish my sandwich. He brought it to the attention of restaurant staff and they made him a new one but I've never seen such a huge, black dead fly stuck in some food before. You may not mind \"some extra protein\" at such good prices and quick service but I won't go back."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say about this place. I love falafel and all the fixings and this place was really really bad. The rice was mushy and so was the falafel. Tasteless! The lettuce and pickles were not fresh at all. I couldn't even finish my food and I was starving!!!' I was too embarrassed to even tell them how poor the food was. My bff is Lebanese and I have been exposed to some of the best shawarma and middle eastern food on the planet and this was just disappointing. They say everything tastes good when you are hungry, this place just proved that's not the case. I am SHOCKED they are still in business. I wouldn't even feed this to my dog! I regret not doing my due diligence this time and checking out the reviews. 1/2 star just for the nice guy with the big brown eyes that served us and that's being generous. I paid $20 + dollars for 2 meals that ended up in the garbage so I had to review this place to save someone else the disappointment."}
{"text":"Shawarma Max may not be a gourmet Middle Eastern restaurant, but you can't ask for more from a walk-in halal place. I actually prefer it over many sit-down restaurants, not to mention other walk-in shawarma joints. Quick service and hearty serving sizes makes this a reliable option time and time again.

My go-to order here is the Chicken Shawarma Plate. You get a better bang for your buck going with the plate, rather than the wrap option. The guys behind the counter here are pretty generous with the amount of rice, vegetables (e.g. lettuce, pickel, onions, beets), and chicken they pile on your plate. The chicken is shaved off a rotating cooker, and re-grilled right before serving, which means the meat stays tender but hot on your plate. As with other halal places, you get your choice of tzatziki, tahini, hot sauce, and salad dressings to pour on."}
{"text":"Food is okay at best (or at least it's filling).
The rice was pretty soft (they might have added too much water that day so it's pro a my not an every day thing), and the meat was pretty dry (especially the beef). And the baklava was just okay compared to the other places I've been to in the GTA."}
{"text":"Wow that was vile. $10 plus an illegal 50 cent debit charge for low quality meat, shitty vegetables and soft, rotten turnip slices. I don't even know what that was supposed to be but it wasn't a chicken Shawarma plate, that's for sure."}
{"text":"so whats so great about Shawarma Max? 

First, it opens late! especially during weekends... it would be a great late night snack after a night out at the club or bar. 

Second, it tastes GREAT! so far one of the best Shawarma I have had.. 

Third, its reasonable priced!! around 5 bucks get u a full tummy, what more do u expect? 

So what makes it not a 5 star? No side dish and drink is not included. Also, the overall environment is not welcoming for dine in, recommended as a take out place."}
{"text":"I always order the chicken schwarma.
Its good value and tastes great.
Simple and good.  
Their sister property closer to Yonge and Sheppard does taste better, but this could because they are busier and this fresher in quality.  

Tip:  Request for the sections with less salt."}
