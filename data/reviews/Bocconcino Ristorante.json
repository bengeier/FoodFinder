{"text":"I have been there twice, great food, ressonably priced.  See photos upload for food ordered, liked everything.  Liked the Tiramisu the most.  The dessert menu is different everyday so they might not have it.  Be sure to ask...  ( and yes I have a sweet-tooth just so you know )"}
{"text":"I love this place. When in Toronto, I make sure to stop by and eat at Bocconcino Ristorante.  Nice ambiance, very warm and comforting. Great for dates and also for family gatherings. Easy parking as they have their own private parking lot.  As far as I am concerned, coming from the New York City area and having been to Italy, this is probably one of the best and most authentic family-style Italian restaurants around in North America.  Dishes of note: 1. Antipasto (Assorted cured meats, peppers, olives, cheeses) 2. Bruschetta 3. Grilled Calamari 4. Any of the Pasta dishes 5. Osso bucco 6. Grilled Leg of Baby/Spring Lamb  Excellent service.  Maybe because we are familiar with the staff there. Prices are reasonable if you can limit the Wine consumption."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised why there aren't more reviews of this place. Maybe because the restaurant is not easily found, hidden behind hwy 7 in what is mostly a small office area. You wouldn't be caught causally walking down this street and go \"let's try this place\".  Or maybe because the families that come here don't Yelp, or they want to keep this place to themselves. Whatever the case is, I wandered around, found them, and now they're exposed.  Restaurant Not a lot of parking in front of it, but enough surrounding it. Pretty small inside, with a couple small tables and a couple large tables. Maybe between 10-15 at most.   Service 2-3 waitresses/waiters. Menu is in Italian and they will walk you through it. They aren't pushy and will not rush you. You get plenty of time to decide, and enjoy your meal and company in between each dish. It feels like you are dining at an upscale restaurant but with a homey touch. The staff are personable. They will have a drink with you. It does feel like family.   Food Grilled calamari is recommended. Easy to cut through and eat. A light charred taste from the grill to give it flavor. Splash on some lemon to enhance it all.  Veal comes covered in mushroom sauce. That veal is perfect. Mushroom sauce is not strong so it doesn't overpower your dish. It's also not salty like some of the others I've had. Vegetable sides are way too soft and overcooked for my liking. That's my only complaint.  Sausage penne pasta was also really good. Tomato sauce was just right. Penne pasta was cooked to perfection.   I think I've said too much..  keep this place only for those in the know.  5 stars.."}
{"text":"Great service and quiet little spot that is perfect for a dinner where you plan to sit for some time and chat away. Food here is fresh, delicious and the menu is simple which is perfect!"}
{"text":"If you want home cooked Italian food this is the place to go!!!  I rarely order Pasta of any kind unless I am in Italy. But I was in the mood of Italian and this was the perfect spot.  Service was A-1....he basically told us what ever you want we will make it!! How ever and what ever you want in your pasta. So I asked for meatballs with Chicken with a meat sauce and cream sauce....and there it was....exactly how I asked.  I love spice and can handle almost everything. I am not sure what he brought us but a day later I am still feeling it!!!  Great experience and I will be back for more....  I forgot to mention that we started with friend calamari and it was as good as the greeks make it!!! lol...just had to throw that in."}
