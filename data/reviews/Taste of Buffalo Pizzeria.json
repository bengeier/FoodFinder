{"text":"I SOOOO want to like this place.  Being a former Buffaloian, I know wings.  Maybe I just caught them on a bad night?  I thought the wings were dry.  I asked for Hot Wings and didn't find that to be the case.    The owners were friendly and engaging and it turns out we didn't live far from one another back home.  I feel a bit guilty giving a bad review... :( I'm sorry.... like I said I really want to like it.  It is a humble NY pizzeria, I only had their wings so I can't judge their pizza.  I may try it out one day but i think I will pass on the wings."}
{"text":"Only open till 9 are you kidding me? Wait you are, I walked in at 8:30 on a Saturday and was told sorry we already shut the kitchen down?!  Gave them another chance the next day, tried to order delivery, and was told they were out of everything I wanted to order. TERRIBLE! I'll never go back and will tell everyone I know about my experience."}
{"text":"Does not deserve a 4 Stat rating, it should be 2.5 or 3 at best. Wings were very okay (very large, but taste just okay), pizza very average nothing special, sub sandwich was barely eatable. May try one last time to verify not just a bad night, but no time soon."}
{"text":"The pizza was good and so were the chicken wings. The beef on weck came with only a little container of Ajus gravy.  The beef on weck was sliced way too thick. It may have been a different cut of beef but was cut way too thick.  I've never seen a thick cut of beef like this in Buffalo.  In buffalo what you get is thinly shaved beef piled high and it comes from the top round portion.  Staff was friendly, you have to go up and place your order, then they deliver it to your table."}
{"text":"Taste of Buffalo is delicious. I was skeptical at first, as I am originally from Long Island and Buffalo style pizza just is not what I'm used to. The sauce is sweeter and the dough is a little softer than typical NY style pizza. But, it's wonderful! The people who work here are ALWAYS nothing but pleasant and delivery service is very timely. Their barbalo wings are tasty as well. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Horrible food,  cramped interior.    Putting the word \"Buffalo\" in this business title is an insult to anyone from Buffalo, NY,  or anyone who enjoys \"good\" Buffalo wings or New York style pizza.   Their pizza is horrible.   The dough is thick,  gooey and undercooked -- worse than most cheap brand frozen pizzas.   The sauce tastes like they just threw a can of bad tomato paste on there with nothing added.   Bland.   I was able to stomach two pieces before trying what they call \"Buffalo\" wings.   I got the medium hotness.  No lie --  these were the worst wings I have ever had in my life.  Dry and crunchy,  They tasted like leftovers just warmed up with Texas Pete's slapped on them.   I thought good wings always came right off the bone and melted in your mouth?   These were like trying to eat twigs.   I'm not going to sugercoat it.    This place flat out sucks.   One of the worst food establishments I've eaten in in the 15 years I've lived here.   Food lion has better chicken wings and pizza.    Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME? We read the reviews here and drove 20 miles last night to try this place out. What the hell is this place even doing still in business? Please tell me people come here for the wings because it sure as hell can't be the pizza. WORST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD...EVER!  If you want to pay eight plus dollars for a four dollar medium/small LAME caesar salad in a plastic disposable container accompanied by plastic forks, then this is the place for you.  Now onto the pizza. We ordered a lg. NY round. I thought it odd seeing a nice authentic style pizza oven and the pizza was being placed on aluminum pans to be baked the entire time never touching the stone. This method steamed the crust and left a soft, gummy,doughy,uncooked consistency throughout the crust. Why you would not utilize the pizza stone to cook the pizza throughout and much more quickly also leaving a nice crispness and pull out much of the moisture is beyond me. The sauce tasted like something from a nasty can of Chef Boyardee. This pizza reminded me very much of something my sister would make as a six year old girl out of a Betty Crocker easy bake oven. To drive the message home that pizza really isn't their thing I asked for Parm. They then had to go into the back room and brought me out two (2) micro-packets...yes..packets of parm for a lg. pie.....nice touch..... really??  People from Buffalo that are giving this 4-5 stars... is this really representative of a good pie from your region??"}
{"text":"Best place around for wings. My favorite is medium from the pit with blue cheese dressing."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza around! The buffalo chicken pizza is the best and the wings aren't too bad either!! Friendly service and delivery guys!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Best wings AROUND!!!! PS if they are busy be patient it's well worth the wait!!!!!"}
{"text":"Grew up in buffalo and visiting. Maybe the worst pizza ever. Next time I will go to Harris teeter first. Is this the best pizza Charlotte has to offer. I am sorry. I wish I could go before 1 star"}
{"text":"ToB is one the best pizza joints I have had the pleasure of dinning in. The service is amazing. The food is off the hook and the portions are phenomenal.   Very very friendly staff and always clean well lit. And ample seating for even a big group.   My family always gets the \"sheet\" of pizza which for a family of six is enough pizza for three kids and three adults.  PLUS left overs for dinner.   I can't say enough good things about the people that own and work here.    Give them a try.  They won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp would let you pick 1/2 stars because I would be at 3.5.  Ate there last night and I am not a huge fan of the style of pizza (western NY) but I have relatives there and have had it before, it is like a hybrid between NY city style thin crust and Chicago deep dish.  The pizza was good, like I said just not my style.  Thew wings are great and so is there homemade blue cheese.  I like the seating they have improved I guess over a year now.  My biggest complaint is the iced tea is from the fountain and not brewed, I know this is a Buffalo style restaurant but respect the southern TEA!  I mean come on even McDonald's,  Burger King and Arby's has real brewed tea.  If you want good wings, Labbatts draft beer this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated with pride.  You have to support that, especially when they make the best chicken wings around!"}
{"text":"Pizza was decent for Charlotte - but for $25 I would have expected more toppings.  Sauce could use some spices too.   Better than most for down here."}
{"text":"I will be the first person to admit that I thought the food (calzone) that I had eaten here on previous visits was good. However, the customer service is terrible. I feel like the customers that come and eat are an after-thought. They have a dining area - there isn't a wait staff...you order and pay at their counter. You are given a number for your table and your food is brought out by someone from the kitchen. The food comes out as it is cooked (which is fine) - so, members of your group may get their meals 10 minutes before other members of your group. Now - the issue is when there is a problem with an order. If you get the wrong meal delivered to your table - your experience will likely take a nasty turn downhill. During our last visit - I was brought something that was clearly overcooked - and it was sent back. I was then brought something I didn't order - the food was prepared incorrectly and I was made to feel like it was my fault. I was given a refund...they did everything they needed to do - but, I never ate. There were no apologies, there was no - 'let's make it right' but, there was a lot of attitude.  If the kitchen is too busy preparing delivery orders that you cannot take care of the people in the dining room - maybe something should change. We won't be back - which is unfortunate. Maybe if you order delivery...you'll be treated better,"}
{"text":"Decent Buffalo style pizza.  Got to love it when people from New York City don't know anything about Buffalo style pizza and assume that their pizza should be thin, flat, and tasteless.  The only thing that is wrong with this place is their pizza's are too small and they use the wrong type of pepperoni.  In Buffalo, all large pizza's are at least 17\" or larger.  Buffalo pizzeria's usually use a smaller cup and char pepperoni made by Ezzo or Margherita.  If they could make the pizza a little bigger and swap out the pepperoni, then this would be an easy 5 star pizzeria.    You don't go here for NY style pizza, you go here for Buffalo style pizza."}
{"text":"I absolutely, love, love, love Taste of Buffalo's wings. If you want to take your food pleasure to a new high, order then from the pit. They fry them then cook them on the grill for a little longer. The lemon pepper is my favorite. The lemon flavor is so prevalent and the pepper is not too strong. We order wings at least twice a week.  I also love the veggie pizza with the marinara sauce, yummy! They even deliver. The restaurant has been expanded so you can dine in and watch your favorite team on any given game day."}
{"text":"Prompt delivery and very kind delivery driver. Food was very good, plenty of cheese. Food was fresh and delivered right to hotel room."}
{"text":"As usual I am stunned by my fellow North Carolinians who give poor ratings to GREAT places and great ratings to BAD places.  Remember Wolfman Pizza= Oh I forgot they are out of business, but there are people on Yelp that gave it a 5 star.  IT WAS TERRIBLE PIZZA.  Taste of Buffalo has very, very good Pizza and EXCELLENT WINGS.  The people there are not rude just direct.  IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THEM DO NOT GO THERE.  The place is a tad expensive, but just like everything in this world you get what you pay for.  Meaning-  IT IS WORTH THE PRICE."}
{"text":"Great pizza, but really, really great wings! I love hot buffalo wings and this place makes the best ones I've ever had.  I always get the Extra Hot and it's the perfect amount of heat for me.  Plus you can have everything delivered to your door and it doesn't get more convenient than that.  Everything I've had from here so far has been excellent.  Highly recommend if you're looking for a really good neighborhood pizza joint that goes above and beyond your basic greasy pizza pie."}
{"text":"As someone from the Buffalo area, I was very happy with the food from Taste of Buffalo during a family visit. I ordered Barbalo wings and pizza which were awesome and I'm a chicken wing snob. Very happy with my food experience!"}
{"text":"Eat here if you enjoy food poisoning.  Immediately following the owner telling me I'm wrong and it's impossible that I got sick at her restaurant.   She's a jerk and her restaurant smells like a bathroom"}
{"text":"Always the go to for pizza and wings! Everything is always so fresh and good quality. I recommend the honey BBL wings! I want to explore their menu more. I have heard nothing but good things!"}
{"text":"We had ordered one of their sheet pizzas for a get together along with a load (75) of their wings. We also opted for their special 'made in buffalo' pepperoni. I was really impressed with this pizza. It wasn't crazy thick like a deep dish and it wasn't thin like New York style slices. It was just the perfect thickness. On top of that, it was absolutely delicious. We ordered both mild and medium style for the wings and they really weren't anything to write home about. Maybe it was because it was a delivery order but when they arrived they were just a little on the soggy side. The wings were a decent sized wing and the flavor was just ok. I'd recommend going with the hot ones if you have a taste for those. The mediums tasted pretty 'mild' to me.... overall this is a great delivery option for pizza. A little on the high side for price but if you are in the mood for a better than the standard delivery option (Pizza Hut, papa johns, dominoes) then this is your spot."}
{"text":"Being from Buffalo, this is the closest to Buffalo wings and pizza you can find in NC. Great food. For those who don't like the wings, you must not have had good wings to begin with. Those who don't like the pizza, this isn't \"NY\" pizza, it's Buffalo pizza."}
{"text":"I love this place. The pizza reminds me of home and tastes like authentic Buffalo pizza. The subs are excellent and the wings are good too. I really recommend the wings from the pit. The people that work there are great too. Also, delivery is typically very timely."}
{"text":"This place has us absolutely addicted. The best...wait, only wings I like..half the barb. Philly cheese...OMG. Jenns club with sweet sauce & add mayo. I might need to order again today....did I mention they deliver?!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome I got a pizza and cheese stuffed bread sticks, had no complaints. The person who answered the phone was very friendly and personable and the food arrived early which is always a plus! Just watch out for the melted cheese in the box it mixed in with the paper underneath the cheese sticks and almost accidentally ate it!"}
{"text":"Wings are great, but the lady wouldn't let me take more than 3 napkins. Three napkins for 10 wings? And not good napkins, the small ones you place your cocktail on. How stingy can you get, limiting napkins.. Give me a break."}
{"text":"Best wings in town, hands down. Nice, friendly staff. Pizza is great as well. I normally have food delivered and have never had an issue, they have always been on time and correct food delivered. Fish fry Friday's are great!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks for \"helping\" us eat Friday night...appreciated your understanding!!!  We went to bed with full tummy's!!!"}
{"text":"Just order a pizza and a salad. They said 45 minutes it took an hour and a half then they call my mom a lier when she called to check to see if the delivery guy was ok. The foods always good but, customer service is lacking. Also I would rather pay 20 bucks for a pizza than pay 12 plus 3 for pepperoni and 3 for delivery."}
{"text":"We ended up here after waiting over an hour somewhere else with still no food. I'm glad we switched. The grilled wings were the best I've ever had. Huge wings, wonderful flavor. The fries were good too!! I'll definitely be back. Casual place with TVs. It was a Friday night about 9pm and not crowded at all."}
{"text":"What a bummer tonight was. It's the Friday before Halloween, and we had some friends over. I decided to order from ToB, as I have about a dozen times over the last 2 years. To be honest, the pizza has always been pretty poor. (There is a lot of unstructured dough with no crispness, no chewiness, no flavor.) But I raved about their wings from the pit and their authentic Upstate NY fish fry. Everyone was excited for the feast.   When it arrived, my husband (gluten free) had a nice pasta dish, the fish came looking gorgeous and the little pizza no adults were advised to eat arrived for the hungry little kids. But the real star of the show - the wings? Nowhere to be found.   I called, and the woman on the phone asked me to count and describe the boxes we received. Did we look in all of the boxes? I assured her we looked in all 3 boxes. She called the driver, and he confirmed he delivered everything.     While I will give her credit for apologizing, she stated that she would have to make us 'another one' and send it out. There wasn't a first one, so there can't really be another one. An hour and 50 minutes after my original phone call, the 30 wings I ordered and paid for finally came, when most of our party had left. No coupon, not even 5 extra wings for our trouble (and disappointment and hunger.) Not only were long time customers let down, but two other local couples who had never tried this restaurant probably won't be calling soon either."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings, BUT the pizza was better years ago before they stopped making it true WNY authentic due to locals' input.  One of only a few places in the area that make a true WNY yeasty crust pizza that is doughy, but again it was better before they changed it some.  The other menu items are standard Pizzeria fare and I'd recommend both the dine-in and takeout/delivery experience and also feel it's a good family eatery.  One last thing about the food though is the seasonal Haddock fish fry, which it too has gone down in both quality and quantity as the establishment has become more popular."}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe the owner (woman) is from Buffalo, as she is the rudest small business owner in NC. We have been to this rest several times, and are blown away by her poor attitude, stingy portions, extra charges for sauces, and general lack of customer service. Today was the best one yet, in that she made us take my babies sippie cup outside, because they don't allow outside drinks....ummm yeahhhh....  Last time well spend our money here, and this is why 85% of small business fail in the first 5 years. Enjoy your stool by the window."}
{"text":"This review if for take out.  Ordered a sausage pizza; wings that are deep fried and char-grilled on the pit. Wings are out of this world and so addicting."}
{"text":"Don't even listen to these liberals on here complaining.  This place is the best place in North Carolina for pizza and wings.  I've been here from buffalo since 2012 and I have been around the block testing out pizzeria after pizzeria to get that home taste.  Found this gem and I've been going with them since 2014 when I discovered them.  Keep up the good work and I apologize on behalf of these liberals on here that complain over everything.  You know how it goes with snowflakes."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from ToB for years. And the assistant manager (female) always recognizes us, and always gets out or order correct. We have also had the owner (husband) deliver to our home a number of times and he is fantastic. This particular time, the \"wife\" owner was working the phones with her husband and even though it sounded like things were crazy there ( they both picked up the phone to speak to me , not knowing if I had been helped)  I still thought our order would be correct. Nope.  I called back to see if our bbq chicken pizza could be delivered, because we had gotten a buffalo chicken pizza. I spoke with the friendly and professional assistant (male) manager, then he handed the phone to the (wife) owner. She was unwilling to apologize, denied that she had not heard the order correctly, and did not even give me the opp to order the replacement. \"That's what you got, sorry.\" I was appalled. In all our dedicated business (which the husband and assistant manager would have known) have I ever had someone so brash and disrespectful to loyal business. Even the male assistant manager had the tone of \" Yea we have the owners on the phones tonight I'm sorry this isn't the norm.\" Please return to regular, respective service."}
{"text":"Closest thing to Buffalo food I've found! Looooove this place! The pizza and chicken finger subs are the best! Wings are really good too! I currently drive over 30 minutes about once a month to eat here! Wish they had more locations!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed. I have been here several times and food is good but nothing special. Tonight will be my last visit here because they just want to nickel and dime you for everything. If you need more than one cup of dressing for your wings that will be and extra charge. I order take out tonight because I'm in the process of moving and I asked for some paper plates because all mine are packed. They wanted to charge me extra for paper plates on a take out order. This is extremely poor customer service if you ask me and I refuse to support places like this."}
{"text":"So, I have held off on reviewing Taste of Buffalo because I wanted to try things from all the different categories on their menu.  I have to say this place is across the board great!  I love everything from their pizza, (regular and speciality) to their wings, and their subs are also great.  Every time I am in the mood for pizza, wings, or sub this is the place I go.  Also, the entire staff is so friendly and happy which always makes me more eager to order from them than anyone else.  They also just remodeled and have a big dinning room with a bar.  I can't say enough good things about them and wish them many many years of continued success!"}
{"text":"Well, this is no where near a taste of Buffalo and even more of an insult, the great taste of pizza from Buffalo.  Very disappointed. Very heavy, very doughy, too much cheese, way too much sauce, overload.   This is definitely more Huntersville High School cafeteria pizza, and I mean that literally.   Good customer service for 2 stars"}
{"text":"I am originally from buffalo and these folks have earned their name. The only thing worth mentioning about Buffalo NY is that they have a lot of really good places to eat and of course niagra falls. Taste of Buffalo really have done a great job of bringing some of the culinary favorites of local buffalonians down the NC. Quality ingredients, consistency, perfect wings."}
{"text":"Aflter 5 years of ordering ive finally had it...the lady (owner) is the rudest most ignorant woman ivr ever spoken to... lastt three times Grease has leaked all over the pizza and everywhere through the chicken wing box I called the lady to tell her and she said I'm lying and that's impossible. I will never order from a place again!! Being from Buffalo I wanted to support this company .. but this lady obviously doesn't care about pleasing the customer. You just lost another customer"}
{"text":"I think it's all about knowing how to approach this place.   For me, I stick with the wings (Barbalo, Pit style) and usually order them for pick-up. Why do I stick with the wings and takeout? Well, the sheet pizza's really aren't my thing, and yes, the interior is a little cramped as far as dining in. I don't really hold it against this place, nor do I find it to be a flaw. It's just my personal approach.   The blue cheese is house made, and goes great with the wings, and I believe they deliver too---which would easily make it the best delivered wings in the area.   Also, if you're a Buffalo Sports fan (Bills, Sabres) they have a ton of cool memorabilia in the restaurant, which always seems to strike up conversations among patrons."}
{"text":"If you're from upstate New York and miss all the good food we have at home this is the place to try. I have now tried the wings on two occasions and the pizza once.    The wings are delicious and very much like wings at home. This is the place we go if I'm craving it, and I'm almost happy it's as far away from our house as it is because I'd be going there a lot more often.   If you want New York style pizza,  this is not the place. Pizza from upstate New York is a bit more on the thick side, so don't expect the super thin slices you get in the city.   Included on the menu is also Beef on Weck and Haddock Fish fries on Friday...two things hard to find in Charlotte!  They also have Salens hotdogs but I'm a Zweigles girl (you can get Zwiegles at VBGB just FYI).  :)"}
{"text":"Number one, great customer service! Both times we called in an order for delivery on a Friday night which of course is a busy night for them, they don't make you feel rushed or a bother! A definite plus!  We had their garlic knots, which are large! They come with a side of melted butter and marinara. We did not even open the sauce, the better was perfect !  Tonight we had the white pizza and the Greek pizza. White had some tomatoes under the cheese.  The Greek.. Just picture a Greek salad on top of a cheesy pizza and there you go! My husband and I both loved this one!  We tried their pizza on weck, and that one is to die for!! Roast beef, horseradish = perfect!  Their crust is nice and crispy also! This is our new go to pizza place!"}
{"text":"Being from NY, this pizza does nothing for me. The crust is thick and doughy, not at all what I call NY style pizza. Salads are just ok. The pizza logs are delicious!!! Overall, good place if you're in a pinch, otherwise I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. I've tried five different specialty options and have not been disappointed. Go Bills!"}
{"text":"These buffalo wings are on the money.  We tried them in the hot buffalo style and they were delicious!  They had the right amount of crispness and flavor all packed into one.  This place is really busy on the weekends both for dine in and take out.  TOB is located in the strip mall across from the Northcross bowling alley"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area I just gotta eat here the food is crazy good I love the wings I love the pizza I love that I can order chicken tenders and get them in any sauce and the blue cheese is to die for"}
{"text":"Food is ok, I much rather drive to exit 36 for better wings and pizza. Prices are ridiculous, 14 dollars for a Royal sub, really? The last time my sister went there she spent over $100.00 asked for some paper plates and napkins they tried to charge her so they lose in my book. Customer service I understand (since I don't go there anymore) is horrible have you ever heard  of the soup nazi?"}
{"text":"A snow storm of 2 inches in Huntersville may paralyze every other restaurant that delivers but if you you want your food delivered call these guys from Buffalo New York. The pizza and wings are fantastic, their service is great and they will deliver when no one else will."}
{"text":"I get the distinct impression they dont want you as a customer and that you are lucky to get the privilege of paying them.  When you take advance orders and charge in advance you need to keep your promise.  They have 15 minute windows for pickup and I am over 30 minutes past my window, so more than two windows.  I was told I could get the order and make it back in time for kick-off.  Now it is looking like I might make half-time.  I called in advance and they accepted the order.  If you can't make the orders you shouldn't take them or you shouldn't assure people they will be able to get the order and make it by kickoff.  They told me five more minutes, after ten minutes I told them to bring it to me and gave them the address.  They had me sign the credit card slip and then said it would be $2 for delivery.  I came pickup and 35 minutes later I told them I am missing the party and they need to bring it to me.  Why am I paying for delivery?  I ordered pick up and I showed up to pickup.  This is the busiest night, I get it.  Don't promise all this food and then delay me through the bowl.  It is now too late to find another place and I am already well into being an hour late to the party.  All this aside, there are plenty of signs telling you what the restaurant won't do for you.  If you get the wrong dipping sauce they won't change it after you get your food.  They won't change orders 9 hours in advance to have more of something without cancelling anything.  There is a major customer service problem here, the entire attitude is that pizza places are an incredibly competitive market.  You shouldn't bend over backwards to be someone's customer if they don't want you as a customer.  If you read all the way down here you probably want to know if all this trouble was worth it.  If you believe it could possibly be worth it then you are the type of customer for this place.  If you think there is no way this pizza could be good enough for all this trouble then you are going to hate this place.  Pizza showed up 7:45pm, an hour and fifteen minutes later.  Wings soggy and mild, not really medium.  Pizza was alright."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the price is prohibitively expensive. Purchased two 1/2 sheet pizzas and jalepeno poppers. Was over $60. Charged extra to substitute a veggie for a meat. Was not told over the phone of the charge or the total. When we arrived, we asked about the high price and the cashier explained the substitution charge. She pulled a menu to show us where it is written and basically stated \"I didn't take your order\" and \"it's on the menu.\" We did not get an itemized bill to see if we also got also charged for no sauce. Disappointed with customer service and no real desire to keep us as a customer. There are other great options in the area now."}
{"text":"It's so refreshing when I have to go up to Huntersville because I know that I'm going to treat myself to A Taste of Buffalo,  And today it didn't disappoint today I ordered a 5 piece honey hot tenders and they were totally delicious. Being raised in Buffalo it's always good to just have a taste of it here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Been driving by this place for the better part of a year. I see the sign and think \"beef on weck.\" Mmmm Buffalo. So on a chilly November evening I figure it's worth a go so I go. Enter to the left of the beer garden and you are at the window, giant menu to the right, little ones on the counter. After the sticker shock you remember Buffalo is in the same New York as New York and get on with your order: wings, beast on weck, and a beverage. The wings are so Buffalo! Large and meaty and saucey with celeries and blue cheesing. First time in so I erred on the side of caution, medium has good flavor but little heat, go with hotter. The thick-ish sliced beef is delicious and tender and subtle and stacked on a heavily carawayed roll with fries and horseradish and extra gravy on the side. Chunking a star for the horseradish: it should be stiff enough to open your sinuses and fortify a body for -20°. This stuff is sweet like candy, probably why the locals think 35 is cold."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine lived in Buffalo for a number of years, and I would visit him in the fall when he had a chicken and clam bake.  I also worked with him, so my company paid to travel there a few times, and I spent a good deal of time in Buffalo over a few years.  It's safe to say that Buffalo has some good food.  Probably because the weather sucks.  They have to have something, right?  It's not like the sporting gods have smiled on them.  While people think I'm crazy, I think Buffalo is a great place to visit.  We even went to Niagara Falls in January.  I highly recommend it.  Not only can you sample some of their great food, you can do so at cut-rate prices (who flies to this part of the country at this time of year?), and the Falls look beautiful when they are frozen.  In any case, the Taste of Buffalo pizzeria is run by people from Buffalo (I asked), and their shop reminds me of the friendliness of the people in that part of the country.  They even have plenty of Pepsi signage, something you just don't see as much of here (Pepsi has a huge market share in Buffalo).  As to the food, it depends on what you order.  We had some of their special stuff peppers - special because they were on special, not necessarily because they were special - and they weren't so great.  The flavor was good, but not great.  They would have been better served with some sausage or something instead of just the cheese mixture.  The pizza, however, was quite tasty and really hit the spot.  I would suggest you don't eat the food there in the shop.  For one, it's a bit small (and hard to find).  For another, it's cramped and whoever comes in the door brings the outside in with them.  If you're looking for Buffalo weather, this can be a good thing - you'll get it (in the winter, anyway).  In the summer, you'll probably get heat when the door opens.  Definitely go for the pizza and the service.  The atmosphere?  Not so much."}
{"text":"My husband and I love taste of buffalo. Both buffalo natives, we had a hard time finding pizza in nc that we loved after relocating here. We have found it! Doughy and delicious- and offer a sheet pizza! Another rarity around here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza and wings place in the area! The pizza is really good and they have really good wings, that are huge! I have to have their homemade blue cheese every time I go! Its soo good! My husband and I usually get takeout from here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Lake Norman area! Wings and chicken fingers are delicious as well. A family favorite for us."}
{"text":"I ordered wings from Taste of Buffalo Pizzeria for the Super Bowl.  I thought ahead and ordered the day before and they took my order without a problem.  When I came in to pick them up the next day at the scheduled time they were ready to go.  I almost had to pull off the side of the road and start eating before I got to the place I was going for the Super Bowl.  They smelled great but they tasted even better!  I got two kinds, hot and medium.  Both were fantastic and the blue cheese was very fresh and outstanding.  I'm picky about my wings and blue cheese too!    Look, I've been eating wings for years and I know a good wing when I taste it.  Taste of Buffalo Pizzeria makes good wings.  I cant wait to have them again!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the good. We were at a get together at a friend's house where wings from Taste of Buffalo were served and they were really good.  My husband raved about them! I also had some salad that had chicken, candied pecans and fruit in it (not sure what it is called). I liked the salad part but not the chicken in it. It reminded me of the precooked chicken slices you get from the refrigerator section of the grocery store (which are less than tasty, in my opinion).   When we left the get together hours later, my husband and I decided to swing by the restaurant for a slice of pizza. Their info online said they close at 10 pm on Saturday. It was 9:35. I tried to call to place a pick up order and it went straight to a recording telling me they were unavailable but confirming that they didn't close until 10 pm. We were only a few miles from the restaurant so we figured we'd just drive there to place our order. I tried to call again on the way there but got the same recording.   We pulled in the parking lot at 9:45 and went inside. The friendly employee asked if we were there for a pick up order. I asked if they sold slices and she said they didn't on the weekend but they sell personal pizzas. When I began to order one, she turned around to look at the kitchen and said \"actually, we put everything up. I'm so sorry\". I told her that I tried to call in my order and she said \"we stop taking calls at 9:30\".   Left without any options, we simply left. The whole situation was really frustrating and super disappointing."}
{"text":"Bring an appetite and lots of napkins.  The chicken wings were great, fresh and just the right amount of heat. The atmosphere is lay back friendly. Staff were friendly and interactive. Can't wait to try the pizza. My Son loves the place."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, wings were great and brought out exactly how we wanted. Their home made blue cheese is amazing! Everyone there was very nice and attentive. The place is clean."}
{"text":"As a life long Buffalonian, having this place in Hintersville has been a life saver! The food is just like home! Fast delivery!"}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome - just like in Buffalo. Wings are just okay though. Prices are ridiculous! If you go, have the Royal sub, but it'll cost you! We won't go back because off the prices."}
{"text":"Can I give a \"no star\". An \"F\" worse ever. If you can't cook decent food --SHUT DOWN. You must be passionate about your business because it's a reflection of who you are that own it. This place has no passionate owners because food SUCKS, over priced, use cheap ingredients and just don't taste good. Salad croutons will require you to have dental surgery. I can get better pizza from grocery freezer. Price is ridiculous.  Never again!"}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed my pizza! I asked for well done and it came perfectly. The guy on the phone was super friendly. Delivery was prompt.  The cheese sticks were fantastic, also!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from here 2 times now.  Both times getting the same thing (Cheese steak subs, and french fries).  Delivery has always been extremely fast, especially since they were both on Friday nights.  only suggestion is, order more than 1 fry, very small amount per order.  other than that, great food!"}
{"text":"It was ok. I'm from buffalo. This is not buffalo style pizza. Wrong pepperoni.. dough is good.. sauce is fair. The chicken finger pizza is their better pizza. Closest to buffalo style for anything they offer. Don't get the cheese and pepperoni if you really miss your buffalo pizza from back home. You'll be disappointed. Get the chicken finger.. wings were good too.. definitely not the pepperoni. We couldn't enjoy it. I was in town for 2 weeks and wanted something from home.. this isn't from home. Sorry guys.. you tried.. but Buffalo is a big name to live up to for pizza and wings.. change the name to ... sorta like Buffalo pizza.. it's not the taste of Buffalo in my opinion.. after 30 years of plowing face on pizza up here... I know what I'm talking about. Thanks for the opportunity to post a review."}
{"text":"Updating to four stars just because of the wings.  We were in charge of bringing a bunch of wings to our neighbor's son's 30th birthday bash at a rented house on LKN so, I rolled the dice and opted for 100 Hot from a Taste of Buffalo.  I called ahead on Friday and they were ready as ordered at 11:15 AM on Saturday.  The wings were a huge hit and darn near every one of them was eaten by the end of the day.  I like my wings a bit over-cooked and these were to just the perfect point.  Keep in mind that they didn't get served until after a 40 min. drive to the lake house so, I am sure they would be even better eaten in house, fresh from the fryer.  The blue cheese dressing was homemade and oh so much better than some crud poured from an industrial sized jug.  The only down note was the paltry amount of celery that was provided to go along with that many wings.  Luckily someone else at the party brought a veggie tray :)"}
