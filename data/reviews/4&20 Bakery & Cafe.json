{"text":"This place is great. The name, the owner, the food, the coffee, the cleanliness, the vibe, etc.  I had the special cold brew, quiche and the breakfast sandwich.  All perfect!"}
{"text":"Love this little bakery. Pastries are wonderful - we sampled their take on the pop tart and the morning bun (aka cinnamon roll). Both were yummy and had unexpected flavors."}
{"text":"Really really good food. I've eaten here twice.  Order the biscuits and gravy with an egg on top you'll be glad you did.  The biscuits are fluffy and crispy on the outside and an order comes with three!  The service was friendly and fast.  I am excited to return and try some of their other things in the future."}
{"text":"Wonderful. We tried the blackberry pop tart and savory scone along with lemon blueberry french toast and 2 bisquit sandwiches. Mouth watering. Worth the extra drive."}
{"text":"Fantastic bakery (for the most part, don't eat scones if you like real scones).  
Crappy ancora coffee.
Lunch menu is really nice, haven't had breakfast yet. 
Welcome addition to neighborhood."}
{"text":"Being way out east this is by no means anywhere near where I live, but I would find myself pestering my bf to go with me every so often, because everything I tried so far have been great and makes the drive worth it!

4&20 is nicely tucked away off E Johnson, but no worries, it's really not difficult. Service has always been great and I always feel welcome. But most importantly, everything I have tried so far has been awesome! 

As many reviews have raved (most accurately), their biscuits and gravy are some of the best ones I've tried. There was a time when I had gone all crazy with biscuits and gravy and went around town trying them, but I find myself returning to 4&20 at the end. Rich butter milk biscuits with generous servings of thick sausage gravy, with the option to add an over-easy egg. I tend to find 3 biscuits to be on the heavy side, so I would give one to my bf (no complains there, win-win situation). 

Their pastries are also some of the best around. Home made fresh pop tarts (go lemon cream and nutella), scones and muffins *yums*. One of the reasons that make me wish I live over on the east side (almost)."}
{"text":"I've known Scott since he was at Cafe Soleil and was sad when he departed. Well, imagine my surprise when my husband suggested we try 4&20... and there was Scott! We usually go here for brunch on the weekends. My husband loves the biscuits and gravy with an egg on top; I usually go for the quiche. We also usually get a couple things out of the bakery case - the pop tarts and morning buns are to die for, as are the lemon ricotta blackberry muffins. We've never had a bad meal here, period. It is excellent."}
{"text":"The food at 420 is tasty and a great value. I've had some great sandwiches and specials (notably pork pho) that used interesting and unique flavors. The bakery is passable, but not up to madison standards (Batch, Madison Sourdough, Lazy Janes, Graze). The interior is small and somewhat sterile, but the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Despite one of the more obscure locations for breakfast and brunch in Madison, 4&20 deserves a slight trek northeast for their absolutely delicious breakfast biscuits and pastries. I opted for Breakfast Sandwich #2 with bacon at the behest of almost all of the Yelp reviews on this place, and I was not disappointed. One of the fluffiest biscuits I've ever eaten, with Cheddar, an egg, bacon, and just a bit of butter in between. Perfectly done-- not too heavy either. 

The morning bun was also quite delicious and very unique. The exterior was very crunchy with loads of sugar dusting it, while the interior was very soft, like a cinnamon roll, with just enough sugar/cinnamony-ness to taste like monkey bread. 

Not too many tables (maybe six?) so I can see how this place would be a zoo on the weekends, so I would advise coming on a weekday or late lunch on a weekend, but nonetheless, it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"BEST breakfast sandwiches (Bluephies Deli on the Square does a good egg'n'cheese too, but are only open weekdays). Simple menu, friendly staff, good coffee. Fast service. We haven't tried the baked goods yet because the sandwiches are filling. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Changing my review to an enthusiastic 5 stars. Love the food and coffee (it is a tad on the pricey side but tasty). And either that one rude/unprofessional employee is no longer there or doesn't work very much. All the staff I encounter now are so friendly and really give it a nice neighborhood vibe. They're not the promptest of places so I wouldn't go in a rush, and they still don't know how to initially put enough ice in an iced drink, but this is now my main place for coffee."}
{"text":"Whenever I am back in Madison, 4&20 is my place to go for breakfast.  They have the BEST biscuits!  I go with the Egg Sandwich #2 with cheddar and bacon - of course it's on a biscuit and has the perfect ratio of egg, to cheese, to bacon, to biscuit goodness.  My bf always gets their biscuits and gravy - whenever I can sneak a bite, they are also a solid and more hearty choice.  Start with a treat - pop tart, muffin, scone, Moreo - to go with your coffee.  

The people who work here, including the owners, are also just some of the nicest people, they're what makes Madison and its food places so special.

Caveat:  It is tiny...so don't go with more than a group of 4.  And it's more of a restaurant than a coffee shop, so while their coffee is fantastic, not a place for lounging unless you want to get a stare down from a hungry person waiting to sit."}
{"text":"Yet another place that has no plan for where you are supposed to eat your food. My question is this: when I buy my food and there is clearly no seating where should I eat my food? Outside on the sidewalk? I don't mind a place not having enough seating, but at least have a plan and make it clear to customers. Don't sell them food and pretend like there will be a place to sit and eat it. With people mingling around with laptops, books, etc. for Sunday brunch like they are studying for their final exams, this place has nowhere near enough seating (maybe 8-10 tables). There was a family that could have had nowhere to sit with their food if we or someone else had taken the last table. Is this place Starbucks or does it want to serve a Sunday brunch that people can sit and eat? Also, please teach your front-line staff how to deal with customers in non-pretentious, non-rude, non-sarcastic manner. Unless of course you like paying them to be this way."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings. Have been here about 5 or 6 times since they've opened, and each time it gets a little less great.  

I've tried a variety of items and the best is the Breakfast Sandwich #2 (egg & cheddar on biscuit) -- simple and delicious. Since I don't eat dairy often, it was VERY rich, bordering on butter overload. The biscuits are the best I've ever had in a restaurant, but not as good as my mom's. :)

Was not a fan of the quiche, but love that it was served with greens!  For their baked goods, I've only tried one -- the sticky bun/cinnamon roll -- because I was told it was only subtly sweet. Maybe I misunderstood because it was hurts-your-teeth sweet.

The counter service used to be better. Now it seems to be hit or miss. When visiting with my vegan friend, the cashier wasn't helpful AT ALL. Thankfully, another kind employee (one of the owners?) overheard us, and she was very accommodating, which we greatly appreciated.

The seating sucks when it's busy, and although I like the minimalist look, it makes for a loud, echo-y dining experience.

Overall this place is better than most in Madison, but could benefit from some changes."}
{"text":"First of all, 4&20 should be commended for hiring Mark (I think that's his name, I overheard him introduce himself to another customer!).  He told me it was his first day and he is very sweet and quite cute!   

I came in for breakfast and had the blueberry french toast made with lemon bread.  It was fine, nothing special.   Then had some coffee cake.   Quite bland and a little dry.

Have to say I was a bit disappointed.  I really wanted this place to be special, to be great.  But really the only thing that would bring me back are the super sweet buns (and, yes, I do mean Mark's)."}
{"text":"These guys perfected the modest breakfast.  It's light, well crafted, mmm good, reasonable. 

I can't say enough about the biscuit for my biscuits and gravy.   Wow, these guys nailed it!  The gravy was certainly good, but lacked the wow factor.  Maybe a little more sausage?

My girlfriend had the breakfast sandwich #2, which had the biscuit, havarti cheese, egg, red bell pepper, spinach.  Came with orange slices.  It was a smaller entree, but done very well.  We thought it could've used some more bell pepper, but that's being picky."}
{"text":"Generally I'm not a fan of biscuit sandwiches but 4 & 20's are a wonderful exception. The Hook's cheese is flavorful, the biscuit tender and not crumbly. This was the BEST biscuit sandwich I've had. The addition of ham was worth the up charge.
Can't speak to their other items but will be back to try them."}
{"text":"Without question, 4 and 20 has the best egg sandwich that I have ever eaten.  \"How is that possible?\" you may ask.  Well, it is the homemade biscuits.  They are unbelievable.  Buttery and delicious! 

You may need to wait a bit to get your food, but it is worth it. 

Don't expect great things out of the dining room yet.  It was still under construction last I saw.  But, do take your order to go and sit in the neighboring park. 

If you get a chance, the key lime cookie is a treat worthy of praise.

Service is at the counter and is friendly enough.  

Parking wasn't a problem.

The price is a bit higher than you would initially expect, but absolutely reasonable for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"I just moved back to Los Angeles and came out to Madison for my birthday weekend. And Evan remembered (from about six months ago) that he accidentally overcharged me for the gallon of New Orleans coffee. So when he saw me this morning, he actually gave me $10 back. (I will be going back tomorrow morning to use that $10 on some more coffee.) It says a lot about an establishment when they remember their customers like this and it makes me miss the city of Madison even more. 

While the people here are amazing, their sandwiches and coffee are even better than I remembered."}
{"text":"Nice local cafe with breakfast and lunch items from local ingredients.  Great baked goods, and the beverages I've tried have been tasty as well.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"i had the bacon, egg and swiss biscuit, it was very good. wish i would have bought 2.

the food is very very good, we will definitely be going back.

a number of things on the lunch menu looks very very good, think we will try that next

the only reason they dont get 5 stars is the service is S-L-O-W. took 20 minutes to get my food, and they werent really that busy."}
{"text":"In search of my Sunday morning B&G fix. So I go to Yelp and spy 4&20.  Never tried this place before. So I pull up a couple minutes before 8am and see a gentleman putting out the tables and chairs on their outdoor patio. \"we open at 8:30,\" he tells me, and I am sorry but I don't have the coffee ready yet.\"  Read the review on Yelp, Dunny.  It includes the times they are open.  Doh!

45 minutes later, I am back, and am glad for it.

The coffee is excellent.  Dark, strong and full of flavor.  Then the plate of B&G is delivered.  Fresh biscuits, creamy gravy with a bold taste of freshly ground pepper.  The egg on top adds a great touch too.

I will be back and will have to try other things. But my quest for the ultimate B&G continues, even tho' 4&20 is now on Top of my list."}
{"text":"Yes, please!!! Everything here was a huge hit  with my husband and me. I had a breakfast Sammie and he had biscuits and gravy. Amazing biscuits!!!! Served with a smile and a \"happy Mother's Day\". We couldn't leave without grabbing a Moreo (cookie like a big homemade Oreo that didn't last half the drive home) and a piece of rhubarb cake which we are currently enjoying very much. Can't wait to go back and try more yummy stuffs.
Not much seating at all FYI."}
{"text":"This place is all sorts of awesome.  It's a real simple equation.  When you combine great food, great staff, and a fresh, madison-chic atmosphere, you get a place as tops as this."}
{"text":"I came here about 15 minutes before they closed, I figured they would hate me coming in late, but I was welcomed and treated perfectly. Ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was not your typical Cuban, it was better. It was so good I can't imagine ordering anything else. Had the chocolate chip cookie and a Moreo (a giant homemade Oreo) both great cookies.  I ordered an iced tea for my beverage, it cost $2.50 which I think is a lot for tea, but I understand drinks are a high profit item for small stores like this. I did have a real problem when they wanted to charge me 50 cents for a refill of iced tea. Told the guy no thanks, u can just keep the glass. 
The moral of the story is 50 cents cost these guys one star in my review. But the sandwich, cookies, and service were excellent."}
{"text":"Such amazing breakfast sandwiches. They're also great for calling in to-go orders. Usually ready for pick-up in 10-15 minutes. Great baked goods as well. The strawberry orange scone is really good. I come here too often haha."}
{"text":"The service was friendly. We loved the neighborhood feel. Seating was a little tight but the biscuits made up for it!  Yummy biscuits and granola!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood.  Good food & coffee. I wish they had longer hours because I like to eat lunch at 3:30. Or a mid afternoon tea & pastry."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Madison, hands down, and ranks as one of my favorite breakfast places of all time in fact. 2 words: Biscuits, and gravy. They are simply the best in town.

The standard order of biscuits and gravy come with 3 homemade, buttery, flaky biscuits topped with a rich, creamy, thick, luxurious, perfectly seasoned, meaty sausage gravy. And I mean meaty, there are endless chunks of sausage in the gravy, and it really elevates it from embellishment to meat lover's paradise. This is easily a full meal by itself for ~ $7. You can add extras as well, but I'll admit the extras here are a little pricey [if you want the full monty without paying a whole lot more, get the biscuits and gravy as takeout, bring it home as a blank canvas, and go nuts with the eggs, bacon, etc.]. 

Other food items include french toast and sandwiches. My friend has raved about the Cuban, and actually bought it twice in a row his first two times here. And don't forget, this place is a bakery as well, so don't forget to look at their case of fresh baked pastries by the register, as well as the Moreos and cookies on top!!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time this morning.  My husband and I both had the biscuit and gravy with the egg.  It was wonderful and a very good value.  Also had the best cup of coffee we have had in a while.  Looking forward to returning and trying the wonderful looking breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade biscuits. I had a build-your-own egg sandwich (mushroom, kale, tomato) on a biscuit and--wow--so yummy.  Biscuit had a lovely texture (slightly crisp on outside, soft and crumbly on inside) and delicious flavor! I also tasted the Gravy over Biscuits dish and it was top notch--not a light breakfast but perfect to satisfy a gravy craving.  Decor inside is simple, with big windows that let lots of light in.  Looks like it's located right on a walk/bike path. If I lived in the area, I would be a regular!  Will definitely return to 4&20 when I'm back in Madison."}
{"text":"I listened to the other reviews found this little place and had a great breakfast!  

Coffee worked wonders and I landed in their very clean restroom!   Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"It was charming, but wasn't memorable. Maybe lunches are better, but the breakfast was underwhelming. Scones looked delicious, but given the abundance of outstanding scones in Madison, I would skip these."}
{"text":"This place was delicious.  Sandwiches were great.  And what they do with a muffin is brilliant!  Glad we found it on yelp!"}
{"text":"I just moved 2 blocks from this bakery, and I think I'm going to have to knock them a star for forcing me to buy bigger pants in a few weeks after I overindulge on their pastries. 

Our first visit to 4&20 was a bit of a letdown. we were in the middle of moving and ran in to get sandwiches to go. The food ended up being delicious (one of the better turkey sandwiches I've ever eaten, for sure) but the wait was totally unreasonable. 20+ minutes for 2 sandwiches (that's the real reason for the loss of a star).

Second visit was all pastries, which are well above average, especially for Madison. The cinnamon roll we had seemed like it may have been day-old, which was a real disappointment, because it looked amazing. The morning bun, however was awesome, with flakey pastry, tons of caramelized sugar on the outside and a slight citrus note (which could be heightened a bit, for my taste.) We also tried a blueberry almond scone, which was very good, especially because it was PACKED with blueberries. Yum. 

The space is open and airy. It feels a little unfinished, but I think once they've been around a while it'll get a more comfortable lived-in feel about it. I loved that the neighborhood really seems to be embracing the place. It was full of people each time I went in, with lots of young families taking advantage. I'd love to see the Milio's next door replaced by something that would really compliment 4&20."}
{"text":"Bright friendly place hidden behind Milo's place. Good to start your day fresh and happy"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some breakfast sandwiches before leaving Madison after seeing their good reviews on Yelp. Husband got tea, breakfast sandwich number 1 and a strawberry lemon pop tart. I got citrus iced black tea, breakfast sandwich number 2 and a blueberry raspberry scone. The scone and the \"pop tart\" we're good. This place is definitely a good bakery. Tea was ok. Nothing to write home about (but keep in mind we are tea snobs - to someone who just likes tea sometimes it might be great tea). 
The sandwiches were the really underwhelming part. We did not have to wait at all to order. Just walked in and went to the counter and ordered, place was full, but not stuffed. But it still took over 20 minutes to get 2 sandwiches. We could deal with that if the sandwiches were amazing, but they just weren't. Very greasy, with flat biscuits that crumbled apart (not in a good way). 
Overall, I would recommend them for their bakery items, but unless you like eating super greasy biscuits, try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I am glad my party chose this location for a brunch setting on our weekend getaway to Wisconsin. 

Their small but tasty menu choices are great. They serve breakfast here all day, including some delicious quiche. They also serve lunch after 11AM. I ordered the Classic BLT which was out of this world. Very moist, delicious and the aioli saice was phenomenal. They also serve it with a side of greens and veggies or a bag of organic chips. 

The others in my party ordered a nice delicious plate of biscuits and gravy with an egg on top, a veggie BLT lunch and the italian sandwich which too was mouthwatering. Aside from their mouthwatering meals, their homemade hot sauces are out of this world. I am pretty picky with hot sauces and rarely is there a time a hot sauce leaves a memorable impact on me. Their roasted garlic sauce is the best one in my opinion. Their chipotle sauce was a bit too much for me but I know theres others who'd appreciate the hot factor that sauce brings. Boy what a kick! In terms of drinks, they have mochas. espressos and coffees with amazing art on top, just like how they do in the commercials haha. They also have Sprecher craft soda, which I got the ginger ale but didn't like. It tasted smoky and ashy, the bottle says the ginger ale is fire brewed which I wish there was a way to see what the drinks look like. They don't have a soda dispenser either so I ended up throwing out the ginger ale and got a cup of fresh squeezed orange juice. 

Overall, this place is small, friendly and overall chill. If I am ever in the Madison area again I will surely be back to 4 and 20! Thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"You can tell that everything is homemade, including the bacon. The sausage and gravy breakfast was really good. They definitely have their biscuit recipe figured out. The baked goods were great, as was the smell that hits you in the face when you open the door. Good coffees, friendly staff. There are only 20 seats, so once this place takes off, plan on getting there early."}
{"text":"Cute cafe, but the #1 sandwich was a bit heavy and unbalanced in terms of flavor. Also all the seating options are metal chairs and not the most comfortable."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here, sausage biscuits and gravy had quite a spicy snap ! They were good. The menu is very small and the noise level is loud, it was hard to hear others even at your own table."}
{"text":"4&20 is a fantastic new cafe.  It's hard not to sound like a complete pretentious foodie hipster when talking about them, so I won't even try.  Pretentious Madison foodies, go here.  Go here now.

They make fantastic cappuccinos (8oz, don't scald the milk, flavorful espresso) and homemade baked goods.  The bakery items are so good you talk about them without remembering to qualify the restaurant as not being a pot-pun to your friends in your recommendation.  4&20 refers to the number of blackbirds baked in a pie in the old nursery rhyme, not a stoner pun despite its location back behind a high school next to the railroad tracks.  And the availability of made-from-scratch Pop Tarts with different daily fillings.  (Come on guys, you're not making this easy.)

Breakfast is served all day, and lunch sandwiches include porchetta and one with  goat cheese, fig, and arugula.  The latter was as good as it sounded- sweet, creamy, and peppery.  The restaurant uses a large amount of local, organic ingredients, and is rarely crowded."}
{"text":"Family breakfast and all were pleased. So while the menu seems a little limited, we all found something to enjoy. 

Some may complain (as my teenager did) that there's not enough food on the plate. I think this should be the new normal - good, thoughtfully sourced food served really well with just a fruit side. Because that's all there was my son even ate the orange! Yeah, healthy, no waste, and not gut busting big. 

Staff was great and very kind when our 7 year old spilled her hot chocolate, they cleaned up without complaint and even gave her a new hot chocolate. No tears.

Seating is limited as others noted but space is warm and friendly. Outside seating could be great."}
{"text":"I copied this from my Yelp Elite event review, because I'm suspecting not enough of you are reading my review on 4&20!!!!

Have you not been here yet? 4&20 is the my new favorite bakery/breakfast spot in town. 

Yes I have been here previously, but I have been lazy because this place was already POPULAR and busy 2 years ago. yes. they deserve to be busy.

What do you need most on a Sunday afternoon? Sweet pastries, lemonade and savory biscuit sandwich in a back to the childhood cutesy cafe. Evan is the most friendly chef I've met in a while. He had no qualms sharing the recipe for the house made vinaigrette with the hungry yelpers who hovered while he wrote the details down (yes, I was one of them). Btw, if you need more reason to visit, Evan was Tory Miller's sous chef in L'etoile before he started his own cafe!!

T and Zev kept refilling us with deilcious lemonade and coffee while we gobbled down the treats. And Evan made sure we took home ALL the remaining pastries, because he and his wife were so generous to bake enough for each of us to have 2 of each type.

Decorations were very cozy and kids friendly. Very happy and dream land like. Guys, if you wanna please a lady, bring her here! 

Food was amazing. you have to get the following:

Lemon Ricotta Muffins - ohhhh the sugar crusted top was nice and hard, inside was moist. Sweet but the cherry inside made it well-balanced. SO GOOD.
Nutella Pop tarts - house made nutella. what else do you want? the crust was so good. kinda like an empanada? thicker but good crust. not the flaky kind. 
Strawberry orange scone - nice and moist on the inside. not too sweet.
Strawberry pineapple lemonade - love it, no weird artificial aftertaste.
Biscuit sandwich - Evan, please put this on the menu!! Just use another type of cured meat because copa was kinda hard to chew apart :) Thank you!!
Salad - oh the vinegrette is AMAZING.

Evan has had ample experience catering for university groups and working within the university budget, so if you're looking for a special treat for your event, call up 4&20!! Also another reason to visit is that Evan and his wife have finally gotten permission to open up their patio! So summer hours will be longer in the evening and you can visit and hang out after work ;)

This has been the highlight of my weekend. The lovely food, service and wonderful people has shone light and brightened up this gloomy day. 

I'll be back very soon with my brunch buddies. Can't wait for more amazing pastries!!!"}
{"text":"Hip little place.  Biscuit on their breakfast sandwich was great but over powered the rest of the sandwich a bit.  Good cookies and the raspberry lemonade was very good."}
{"text":"Intriguing name.... at first I thought it refers to the magical powers of the brownies, but later discovered it was referring to the nursey rhyme.

The sandwich is tasty. I would put it as very good, but it was not like the best thing I had tasted. The selection of pastries is good. It's a little more sugary than other shops. The Moreo is definitely worth a try.

The cafe have only few tables and is not conducive to gathering place. This would probably be the biggest knock against this joint."}
{"text":"Easily the best biscuits I've had in my entire life! The staff was super friendly and the entire place felt charming. My friend and I really enjoyed our brunch."}
{"text":"Delicious baked goods, amazing pies, delicate touches make all the difference. Excellent service, seating inside and out. 
My last meal was yummy- yogurt and granola. Just sweet enough and beautiful.
Off the beaten path. Donor miss this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Great coffee (try a New Orleans coffee), great food, great staff, all of the things are great. Best biscuits and gravy in town. Best biscuits make it possible. Sandwiches are phenomenal- fresh quality ingredients. Staff is super cool in so many ways. I walked over one day when it was super cold out. The woman at the counter offered me a coffee while I wanted for my companion to arrive (not a free coffee mind you just a coffee that i could pay for with the rest of my order that I would have waited for if not having been asked) a much welcomed gesture showing kindness and attentiveness!

One change/addition I would like to see is a vegan option. My vegan bestie is my most frequent brunch companion and there are no food options for her here."}
{"text":"I've tried the quiche and biscuits/gravy ... they were awesome. You can tell that the cooks love their job and it shows in the quality of the food.  The dining area is definitely in need of some audio dampening and a few more things on the walls maybe. Overall, great place to dine or just have a coffee and snack."}
{"text":"4&20 cafe makes the best mochas in quite possibly the world. They use Valrhona chocolate and it's one of the most delicious hot beverages I've ever had!

Their dishes are pretty well portioned so you don't feel gorged after brunch, unless you end up ordering multiple plates to share because you can't decide on what you want to eat. I have loved everything I've tried here. I'm a huge fan of their biscuits, especially with the sausage gravy. Their yogurt and granola is great. The bread for their sandwiches is wonderful. I love how they use local ingredients, too! I was so excited the first time I went here and saw that they were using veggies from Butterbean Farms!!

The staff is friendly here, too. The cafe is adorable. Seating is sometimes difficult, but don't be scared to cozy up and share a table with strangers so you can sit down and enjoy your meal! This place is one of my favorite brunch spots."}
{"text":"We went with friends from out of town.  We stopped and had breakfast.  Coffee, juice, tea, hot chocolate and sandwiches.  Everything was delicious.  The only problem with the place is it's behind East High and doesn't have a lot of parking."}
{"text":"Try everything- this round we tried the Mango Key Limeade and Latte, along with the biscuits and gravy and breakfast sandwich #1.  I can tell you that you want to order a 1/2 order of the biscuits and gravy (yep...you can make it a special request) or at least share.  I can tell you that the havarti and the roasted pepper on the breafast sandwich was a very nice touch along with some spinach.  Very fresh and just the right size.  Fabulous!  Chef Evan came out to talk with us and give us our food as well.  We were able to meet is lovely and talented wife, Mandy who is a fantastic baker and just as awesome.  Now that we've tried a slice of breakfast, I need to go back and try some lunch!"}
{"text":"Fabulous biscuits!  Would definitely make this a regular place to stop for a Saturday/Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Oh wow.  I am afraid to review this place, on one hand I want them to do well and on the other I want it for myself.

I have had the biscuits and gravy and they were nicely spicy, not too heavy/greasy.  The biscuits are amazing, so often they are leaden pucks at other restaurants but the ones at 4&20 were even better than moms.

I also had one of their home made pop-tarts, and it was the best *expletive deleted* pop tart I have ever had, heck the best tart I have ever had.  Perfect crust, sweet but not too sweet filling and icing.  Amazing.

Wife has had the breakfast biscuit sandwich thing and loves it.

Pastries seemed well priced, some of the other cafes in the area are considerably higher for less quality.

Negatives.. tea was not the best?  It's too close to my house so I might eat there too much?  I really can't come up with anything.  There are only a few tables so if they take off I can imagine it being crowded on a weekend morning.  

Here's hoping they do well, they deserve it."}
{"text":"Had a delicious and beautifully decorated mocha and the breakfast sandwich #2 (egg, cheddar, biscuit) with squash. Great, quality ingredients. The WiFi is super fast here. Only downside is it's not super large and it's very open so no private, little nooks to hunker down in."}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwich - flaky biscuit and solid egg/red pepper combo.  For some reason, the peach that was included was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brunch place in Madison. This place has gotten super popular now that sometimes we have to wait for a few minutes to get a seat. I've tried the herb cheese sandwich, italian veggie sandwich, and their special of the day, and all came out delicious. As a hot sauce addict, I love the variety of hot sauce they offer and you can pick and choose which flavor you want at the self-service bar area. The side salad is always neatly prepared with garnished pickled vegetables. 

I also enjoyed their strong coffee or perfectly executed cup of latte with my meals. Don't forget to order a side of scone that is fluffy and not overly sweet. This cafe also offers 20% off if you have a Bicycle Benefits sticker. The friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere makes 4&20 a perfect brunch date spot."}
{"text":"The egg sandwiches on a fluffy biscuit are out if this world! Real food. Real good. Real cute decor. Service is great, too.

They serve Just Coffee. Decaf is made to order. 

I consider myself a biscuit aficionado, and I can say these compete with my grandma's. (But you can't beat grandma, right?) The biscuit has just the right amount of flakiness without crumbling in your hands whilst enjoying all the inners.

The egg is perfectly cooked. Not runny, but not dry and rubbery from being over cooked. How do they do this?

I like the #1 breakfast sandwich: Pearl Valley Farms egg, havarti, roasted red pepper and baby spinach on a buttermilk biscuit, served with a side of fruit.

I also add roasted summer squash from their add-on section of the menu. It's a wonderful breakfast that makes you want to savor every bite, rather than stuff your face as you hurriedly start your day.

There are a number of amazing-looking baked goods in the case that I must try over time, but I'm so stuck on this breakfast sandwich, I haven't tried anything else (yet)!"}
{"text":"Everything they make is perfect. Just go and eat anything they have. Try their baked goods. Ty their breakfast sandwiches. Try their Cuban sandwich. Try it all. It will blow your mind. 

A nice little place with a friendly staff and excellent food. And it's affordable, too."}
{"text":"Fabulous! I've been driving past this place for ages and kept meaning to stop -- today I finally did!  I was promptly greeted. My request for a sandwich on gluten free bread was accommodated (it came up on a yummy, toasted english muffin) and was hand delivered to me (to go) by the chef himself. I didn't try any of them, but the home made baked goods looks absolutely stunning.  My lunch was fresh and delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OMGoodness!! 

We pretty much picked this place out of a Madison food magazine in an attempt to go out to breakfast more often. 

It's a simple place with a simple and small menu, but by no means is the food simple! My husband got the biscuits and gravy. They were some of the best I've ever sampled and I don't even like gravy, at all! My son got the lemon something-or-other french toast with blueberries. I stole a bite and it was amazing!! It's the perfect amount of sweetness with tart so the sweetness is not completely overwhelming. I got a spinach, roasted red pepper and egg biscuit. I added some of the housemade spicy garlic sauce. I can't rave enough about how much we enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiches are amazing! I had egg, cheddar, ham, and kale, sandwiched by a tasty biscuit. Orange slices on the side. The New Orleans (espresso, chicory, milk) was really good iced. The one cup of coffee I had was just ok."}
{"text":"Small & quaint place; compact menu with plenty of choice. Breakfast or lunch sandwiches, bakery and espresso creations. Delicious, fresh, and unique. Bread and biscuits used for sandwiches are amazing! Kid friendly. Casual but foodie friendly!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and I love the espresso drinks here - some of my favorite in Madison! I used to work in the area and had always seen this place, but always thought it was some weird political-ish bakery related to the marijuana movement - it's not! Turns out 4&20 is part of a nursery rhyme, so I was thrilled that a friend had me meet her there for breakfast one morning. It is a great little local place that I now love to take people to. Even when I take people from Madison they have often never heard of it and love it! Staff is super nice. The reason 4&20 doesn't get 5 stars is because the service is exceedingly slow. This is not a place I can quickly pop into on my way to work. If there's a line, even a small one, your wait time increases dramatically, regardless of whether you're ordering drinks or food (food takes extra time, though). Also, like other Yelpers, I ADORE the #2 Breakfast Sandwich, but it is sooo oily you cannot call it a healthy breakfast. If it weren't for those two items, I would never make my own breakfast again and come here all the time (and just budget an extra 15-20 minutes into my commute). Still, this is a great shop and a total win if you're not short on time. Always lovely to support a small local store!"}
{"text":"We are from California & we are used to farm fresh food & this place is beyond fresh & home made.  I hate biscuits & gravy & I tried my fiancés & could not believe how good the gravy & sausage was!  I had the egg sandwich & it was just as good.  The place is also very cute & they make their own vanilla syrup?  Who does that?   Needless to say my vanilla late was outstanding 
Go Badgers"}
{"text":"I had a quiche, which was decent, though I wasn't crazy about it.  It came with a salad and pineapple (I love having a complete breakfast like this- protein, greens, fruit).  The salad and pineapple were excellently fresh.

I also had a cappuccino, which was too wet for my preference- it was more like a latte.  But that was fine, because it was also delicious.

I think I should have read reviews before I came, and tried something else."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is beyond friendly, the coffee is great, and the pastries are better. The nutella home-made pop-tart is one of a kind, as are all of their pop-tarts. In fact, I haven't had a pastry here that I didn't like. At times, the wait can be a bit long for food, but worth it. The team clearly puts a lot of thought and effort in their offerings. I Highly recommend visiting! The space is somewhat small though, so don't bring a small army with you."}
{"text":"4&20 is my neighbour on Madison's East Side,
When I found out they close at 2pm I nearly cried,
Their delicious pop tarts, biscuits and fresh food,
Are guaranteed to put you in a great mood,
As I walk by the smells fill me with Purgolder pride!

P.S. Bacon"}
{"text":"It's a granola/hipster kinda breakfast nook. (As if the name didn't give that away) my son and I ordered the breakfast sandwiches and my wife just had a Carmel latte. 

The sandwiches were fine...but not all world like many here are claiming. Little bit dry actually. They gave a few slices of peach in a little cup with the sandwiches and I loved them. Seriously some of the sweetest, juiciest peach slices ever. 

My wife's latte was good. Two biscuit sandwiches and a coffee cost $15. Tad high IMO but whatever. 

Place is tucked into a non-descript mini plaza/building...just like any hipster would find irresistible. I really believe it is an average place with above average hipster cred. 

I'd go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"I tried a soy latte and a chicken sandwich (I don't recall the actual name of it).  I  drink a lot of coffee, so I don't mean this lightly, but this was the best latte I've ever had.  The sandwich was awesome also.  The inside is really cute and clean as well, and the staff were super friendly.  This is my new favorite breakfast/lunch/brunch/coffee/everything spot on the weekends.  Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Biscuits and Gravy and Pop Tarts. Everything was great. Service was top notch. Will return."}
{"text":"4&20 is a wonderful Eastside hidden gem.  Tucked behind Milio's and East High School, this is not a vibrant shopping or eatery location but well worth going out of the way for and it's seclusion is part of it's charm.  A quiet neighborhood (not on school days), some nice outdoor seating, a warm and cozy dining area, with a small amount of coloring books and things to do for kids made this a great stop for my family for Saturday brunch.

I have provided a picture of the menu on the day we dined in the photo area but it seems this is subject to frequent change.  It is clear that everything you are served here is made fresh and in house - even the biscuits and quiche crust.  Not many places in town can claim this.  As such, it looks like menu items may change depending what is seasonal and what they can acquire locally.  For example, others have mentioned peaches served with their breakfast; mine was served with fresh watermelon.

The menu is small, but what they do, they do extremely well.  Hands down the best Chai we've had in the city and we have gone to pretty much every café this side of the Capital.  The Vanilla Café Latte was also extremely good - perfect blend of sweetness without burying the flavor of the coffee.  Quiche was a great balance of egg and other ingredients.  Most places overload the quiche so where you basically get a bunch of ingredients loosely held together by a little bit of egg.  4 & 20 allowed the egg to be focal point, flavored with fresh ingredients over a flakey, house-made crust.

Breakfast Sandwich #1 seems like the staple on the menu and is really solid.  The biscuit is house-made fresh and made me want to try their biscuits and gravy next time around.  The red-peppers and Havarti are a nice creamy and flavorful combo.

The star of the show, however, was the Brandied Cherry French Toast.  Absolutely amazing.  You just have to try it.  We had the toppings on the side for our kids. It is very sweet and it might be better to do it this way if you want to moderate the amount of brandied cherry syrup you put over the top.  The kids loved it and ate pretty much the whole thing.  Mom and I were fighting over the scraps!

All in all, this is place is an amazing find.  If you live on the Eastside, you pretty much have to go to Sun Prairie, the Atwood neighborhood, or downtown to find a great breakfast café.  That is, until now.  4&20 holds it's own against some of the more popular breakfast spots in the city.  And above and beyond that, their prices are reasonable.  Some of the other breakfast cafes are very delicious but overcharge for their food.  4&20 is currently the best value for your money breakfast in the city."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm! First of all, everything is house made and whoa is it good! Had the biscuits n gravy and a potato leek soup-- both were amazing. The biscuits were peppery and delicious-- though the portion was insanely large. The soup was perfectly creamy and filled with bacon, and cheese. Every baked good looked incredible as well, but I had no space left in my belly! Ps- the house-made chai was probably the best I've ever had!!!

Cute location. Small but warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Really chill little breakfast nook with good service and very tasty food. I did just as all the Yelpers advised and ordered up the #2. It was just as promised with a great biscuit and every element was done just right. The breakfast biscuit came with a side of oranges to try to counteract the unhealthiness of my sandwich. I also got a big mug of hot chocolate with my sandwich and everything was under $10 including tax & tip. 

Order up front, then they bring your food to the table. The place gets packed during different hours of the day so try to go in off hours if you can!

4&20 makes for a cheap but tasty breakfast, brunch or lunch in an adorabley laid-back atmosphere!"}
{"text":"So delicious. We stopped in for a quick carry-out pastry, everything looked so good we decided to stay for a soup. Glad we did - wow! Curried butternut squash soup with golden raisins, toasted pine nuts, & date molasses, a lovely toasty piece of cibatta on the side - what could be better on a cold day? Great coffee too. The space is minimal and sunny, which I like. The service is similarly casual, friendly, competent, also a win. Can't wait to try the sandwiches - JenEhr chicken & house-made items like mortadella, salami, cranberry compote - they are really targeting my tastes. So far so good, a great addition to the neighborhood.

Update - still love the 4&20, always great food, friendly & helpful staff, inviting space, seasonally delicious changing menu - I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! My friend and I wanted to try something new for brunch and we are happy we did. Their coffee was great as well as their food. My favorite thing was their homemade strawberry rhubarb pop tart. So delicious!!!! They are also very dog friendly, which is amazing."}
{"text":"Still the reigning king/queen of breakfast sammies! Underground Butcher comes in a close second."}
{"text":"Stopped by 4 & 20 on a roadtrip through Wisconsin and it was amazing. The place is a little hard to find, it's behind Milo's and if there was a sign out front we didn't see it. Walking into the cafe there's the bakery section and ordering counter straight ahead and a couple of tables to the left. Not much seating, especially if you have a larger party, and it was completely full by the time we left. Decorations are really cute, with wall decals, local art on the walls, and fresh flowers on the table. The menu is short and sweet and I was a little worried I wouldn't be able to find something I liked, but we ordered a couple different things and they were all good. The soup of the day was Tomato Gazpacho and it was delicious.  Obviously made from fresh tomatoes and paired with cashews, which I've never had in a soup before but gives it an interesting texture. The Veggie Italian sandwich was the real winner - roasted summer squash, marinated buffalo mozzarella, baby arugula, tomato & giardiniera on ciabatta. Fresh cheese, fresh vegetables, slightly crunchy ciabatta, with a slight kick from the giardiniera... it was amazing. And I don't even like squash. The drinks (pineapple lemonade!) were good as well, and top notch service (the guy at the counter patiently answered all our questions and didn't miss a beat when we continued to add things to our order). Almost makes me wish I lived closer to Madison, just so I could get breakfast/lunch here!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. 4&20 Bakery is a perfect example of simplicity executed very very well. I had an iced coconut latte that was not too sweet or overpowering, but was the perfect mix of coffee, milk, and their house made coconut syrup. The cinnamon roll was also fantastic, even to a non-cinnamon roll lover. It wasn't too sweet and had a great balance of roll, cinnamon, and something pleasantly orange-y. And then on to the sandwiches. I had the #2 with cheddar, bacon, and roasted red peppers. The eggs were perfectly fluffy and the biscuits were awesome. My husband described it as the world's best possible version of a McMuffin. Way to go 4&20 Bakery--I'm definitely a fan and will be back."}
{"text":"Hard to believe it's taken me until today to finally get here. Friends rave about this place, and coffee & breakfast are two of my favorite things. Anyhoo, I'm glad I am finally having brunch a 4&20. 

Today's meal was Breakfast Sandwich #2, the build your own option. You get several choices of fresh local ingredients to make the sandwich you desire. They are served on a fluffy homemade biscuit. 

The house coffee is a dark blend from local roaster Just Coffee, and you can also pick up a bag of beans to replenish the home supply. 

Staff is super friendly and service is great. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We almost didn't stay because it didn't look like much when we walked in. SO glad we stayed! I had the quiche and my husband had biscuits and gravy. Absolutely DELICIOUS and the portion of biscuits and gravy was HUGE! Seriously, this place is terrific."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and left both times feeling grateful to have been so lucky to have sampled their scrumptious wares. Sandwiches? Superb. Cold pressed coffee? Awesome. New favorite: ICED chai tea latte. It has to be house made because I've never tasted one like it. I love this new poptart craze that's sweeping the nation, and 4&20's blackberry concoction will leave you very satisfied. One of these days I will get to the biscuits and gravy that everyone (including the people inside when I last visited) is raving about! The best part? The staff is so freaking friendly!"}
{"text":"This is where I always end up when my favorite weekend brunch spot is overcrowded. I'm extremely satisfied with this occurrence, because this place has the bomb eats as well as great coffee. Their biscuits are transcendent (part of the breakfast sandwiches, as well as the biscuits and gravy). Cute artwork on the walls. Would be 5 stars if they could serve booze, a very solid 4 anyways."}
{"text":"This morning I enjoyed the best biscuits n gravy of my life.  Seriously!  With a perfectly egg over easy on top.  These soft moist biscuits coated with a spicy sausage gravy that you just can't improve on.  My wife got a breakfast cinnamon roll type muffin that was equally amazing and had the #1 breakfast sandwich which she enjoyed with the homemade habanero sauce they had on hand.  Great send off for us from this wonderful foodie town of Madison Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"Best biscuits and gravy in Madison, and they have a half order!!! Friendly staff, clean and great bakery and coffee too."}
{"text":"They have definitely earned their own Just Cofee roast \"reminds me of the first time I played excitebike on Nintendo\" I read aloud as I stalled while the devil on my shoulder wanting the apple strudel cofeecake argued with the sensible angel suggesting salad.  \" It was the first thing that came to my mind when I drank it\", the young barista replied, which attests to the youth vibe of the place both behind and in front of the counter and also how involved the staff are (both times I've gone there I've ordered my selection without meat and both times they've happily bounded back to the kitchen to ask how much less to charge).  Extra nice vegetarian-friendly points.
The vibe of the place makes me feel as energized as the deliciously chill gourmet food (i got both things.....choice is a difficult thing at 4&20)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Had the egg biscuit recommended on Yelp and it delivered. Everything tasted super fresh and the biscuit was clearly made from scratch. Top quality cheese. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Atmosphere was a bit dead around 9am, but it was a workday."}
{"text":"Cute little place with friendly staff. It was quite packed and they don't have a lot of seating, but we didn't have to wait for a table and our good came out fairly quickly. 

I got the banana bread French toast and my partner got the biscuits and gravy. 

The French toast was very good, although extremely sweet. I really like sweet things and even I thought it was a bit much. Almost like eating dessert for brunch. 
The biscuits and gravy were excellent! Slightly spicy, which is a good thing. 

The only thing I really didn't care for was the coffee. We both got their regular coffee and it was extremely strong and bitter to the point that neither of us could finish it. 

I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Wonderful bakery, the pop tart was well worth the calories and their scones were soft and flavorful. We had both breakfast biscuit sandwiches, very good especially after adding some hot sauce. The bacon was crispy, just how I like it! Coffee was was smooth, not too strong in flavor, which is fine for me. Overall enjoyable place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Today I went back and got a Moreo.  Still pretty tasty.

But one of the sandwich cookies was half-missing.  What kind of counter help gives you something that isn't all there?  I didn't notice 'til I was driving away, as it was ensconced in a bag, and I'm not going to drive back for half a cookie, but this bugs me.  Either it was put in the cookie jar this way -- unacceptable attention to detail -- or it broke when the counter help retrieved it -- similarly unacceptable.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever eaten here has been delicious, every friend I've brought (about 6 at this point) has said the same of their food, and their service is superb.

I've had their chicken posole, not a big soup/stew fan, but theirs was well flavored and had a good amount of meat, not watery and weak.  I've had their strawberry french toast with strawberry jelly and a lemon sauce that seriously tempted me to lick the plate.  Thankfully, one of the chefs saw me struggling and offered to simply add more in my to-go container.  I'm not a big egg fan, but their breakfast sandwhiches #1 & #2 (which feature an egg) are killer.  Love the biscuits they're on!  My brother got the Cuban Sandwhich and still talks about it a year after the fact.  Any of their baked goods (muffins, pop tarts, cookies, etc.) are awesome, too."}
{"text":"Yummy! 

4 & 20 is doing so many things right. They churn out fantastic baked goods (strawberry rhubarb poptarts, lemon blackberry ricotta muffins what upppppp) and a cute little shop with the kind of atmosphere that keeps you coming back. 

Ben and I went for brunch on Sunday around 10 AM and were thrilled to find it wasn't overrun with 5,000 people or hour long waits. We grabbed a spot by the window and snagged some coffee (GOOD, STRONG coffee). Housemade granola and the egg and cheese biscuit sandwich made us two happy campers. The portions are on the smaller side, which is a nice departure from some of the \"eat three meals in one to sop up last night's regrets\" brunch places. A charming spot the east side is lucky to have!"}
{"text":"Yummo! If you are looking for the best biscuits & gravy in Madison, it's definitely at 4&20 Bakery & Cafe. Rolled up with the boyfriend on our bikes this morning and placed our breakfast orders at the counter. They also make a bomber iced coffee, if that's your thing. Sat at one of the few small tables inside, and our food came out in about 15 min. My plate was taken up by 2 1/2 giant, fluffy biscuits smothered in gravy with chunks of tasty sausage (very generous portions, I had a hard time finishing all of it even though it was delish). They also have three housemade hot sauces (Thai Chile-super hot, only for the brave; Death By Chipotle-not very spicy but full of flavor; and Roasted Garlic-slightly spicy and full of delicious garlicky-ness) which go ah-mazing with the biscuits. The boyfriend had the quiche, which had Italian sausage, kale, and roasted pepper. I snuck a few bites and have to say, it is also a winner. 

In summary: biscuits and gravy, yum.

P.S. 4&20 offers a Bike Benefits discount of 20% off beverages with a food or bakery purchase."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Friendly staff, great coffee and their food is amazing."}
{"text":"Went to 4&20 today for a cup of coffee and a chat with friends before hitting the airport. 

Friendly staff, a great cappuccino, and the most delicious cherry pop tart (actually a cherry handpie) that my sweet tooth could have ever imagined. 

If you're in the neighborhood (or even if you are not) do yourself a favor and pay this place a visit. My dining companions were raving about the biscuits and gravy so I know what I'll be noshing on next time I visit."}
{"text":"The baked items are second to none, and the prices are reasonable, beating the coffee shops around town."}
{"text":"Had the #2 egg & cheese sandwich on a biscuit. It was fresh & the biscuit was light. I also ordered a double decaf dry cappuccino. Here is where 4 & 20 loses a star. The barista admittedly came over to tell me he was having a hard time getting it right and was continuing to try. Told him not to worry. When he did deliver it, there was no foam, and way too much milk. Also, it was not very hot, so it became lukewarm very quickly. Granted I'm picky about my espresso, but I order it dry because I don't like a lot of milk, but yet what I got was a very \"wet\" cap. I didn't send it back because I know the guy really tried, and I had a plane to catch to boot. The pastries in the glass display looked really good. I'll try one next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"AMAZING

Perfect biscuit breakfast sandwich with HOOKS CHEDDAR
Fresh squeezed orange juice
Delicious homemade \"pop tarts\"
Waits much better than most places downtown 

If you want a non-pretentious, friendly atmosphere with GREAT food, check out 4 and 20!"}
{"text":"What has happened? I waited about 5 minutes for the young woman at the counter to mix up someone's latte before she finally said \"it will be just a few minutes\". Yes, I thought, it has been. So I went to the bathroom. I got back and waited another few minutes before she finally took my order. Really, it's not just bad customer service, it was rude.

I ordered to-go quiche with a salad. I waited another 6 minutes for it to come out, carried by a much friendlier cook. The salad used to come with a garnish of radishes which I loved. Nix. And although the same raspberry vinaigrette was served alongside, the lettuce was giant and bitter. The quiche crust was so so. (It used to be tender and flakey). The quiche tasted ok, but I am not sure I will drive in from Monona any longer to get what was my favorite meal from them. 

Bummer, man."}
{"text":"This is a really great space, it was sunny and warm, with cute decor, without being too cute.  The food is fantastic, one of us had quiche and a wonderful salad, the other had an amazingly large plate of biscuits and gravy.  Amazing food, wonderful place, we couldn't get out the door without bakery to go home with us.

Just a really great place to hang out.  Wonderful weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Although I live only a few blocks away, I hadn't heard about 4&20 until a friend recommended it. It's easy to miss, as I drove past it for more than a year before realizing that it was right next to Milio's on Johnson. 

One weekend morning, I decided to swing by. I ordered a cup of coffee and one of their breakfast sandwiches. I had the \"Breakfast Sandwich #1\" with added mushrooms. It came with sliced fruit on the side. 

I admit it, I didn't have the highest expectations. The coffee and sandwich came to around $12 (including tip), which I thought was a bit much for what I ordered. I mean, how good could a breakfast sandwich really be? 

Also, the wait time for my sandwich was almost 15 minutes (I learned from watching others come in and pick up their to go orders that it would have made more sense to call ahead). 

So as I stood there, waiting for my order, I began to feel a small twinge of regret. In the back of my mind, I thought \"maybe I shouldn't have come here. I could make this at home. $12 is too much. It can't possibly be worth the wait.\" 

But any doubts, any concerns, any frustrations melted away once I got home and took a bite of my sandwich. 

Oh my. 

Oh! My. 

Wow!

It was so, SO good!

Everything was fresh. Everything was perfectly cooked. Everything came together wonderfully. And the fruit on the side was just the perfect compliment. 

Seriously, I was blown away. I still think it's a bit pricey, but it won't prevent me from going back from time to time. Except next time, I'll call ahead. :)"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Muffin and latte were average and sausage gravy was so spicy I could not eat it. It was also brought out ice cold and I had to have them microwave it. Chatty Cathy barista is the only employee visible taking orders and making all coffee drinks so waiting in line for a long time is expected if you go. Blah."}
{"text":"OK, I normally don't post a review after trying just one item from the menu, but I'm making the rare exception here because the morning buns at 4&20 Bakery are SO FREAKING INCREDIBLE!!!  We're talking heaven on a plate, the lovechild of croissant and cinnamon bun.  

You got your textural contrast between the crunch of the caramelized sugar on the exterior against the tender, flakey layers of the interior.  The sweetness of sugar and cinnamon is balanced out with a lingering note of citrus zestiness.  This morsel of heaven is loaded with buttery richness of a great croissant with absolutely no greasiness.  And if you listen real close, you can hear a choir of angels singing when you bite into this decadent treat.

I can't wait to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This is where I chose to go for my birthday breakfast.  I have been thinking of it ever since...may have been drooling about it ever since as well.

Their biscuits!!!  They motivated to try and actually bake biscuits.  Obviously they are going to be nowhere near 4&20 quality but may curb my cravings for them momentarily.  

I will have to go several times to try all the goodies they have.  I am thankful they have the little parking lot there so I can easy run in and run out and be on my happy self.  They have Just Coffee so I can fulfill my java addiction as well.  

Can I say that I love the artwork they have up?  Not necessarily a reason to go but it just made me happy and added to my food-buzz."}
{"text":"A cute & quaint little place with delicious muffins. 
However, I do recommend staying away during East high school's lunch hour."}
{"text":"I love the simplicity of their menu. The staff is amazing and so caring. I love getting my breakfast #2 and coffee here. If I can make it here every morning I would! Everything is made fresh even the baked goods! Their home made pop tarts are to die for! I normally try and buy them all at once. I'm in love with this little place of happiness and couldn't ask for more. If you live on the Eastside of madison this is a must go!"}
{"text":"After one visit, I'm sold that this is one of the best kept secrets in Madison. 

It's a small space behind Milio's and has a small, focused menu. However, it's bright and friendly, and they do everything well. There are probably 8? tables, so get there early on the weekends for breakfast. We were there at 9 am on a Sunday, and had plenty of seating options, but it was quickly filling up as we ate. There's also plenty of parking (a nice sized lot) and a bike rack. 

Drinks: They have a special blend of coffee from local roaster Just Coffee, and make espresso drinks, too. I didn't pay attention to other options.

Breakfast food: Don't miss the pastry case at the counter. Homemade \"poptarts\", huge delicious looking muffins and morning buns. We had a breakfast sandwich and biscuits and gravy. The breakfast sandwich was served on one of their delicious biscuits, and I had mine with egg, cheese and bacon. There are lots of toppings to choose from (e.g., spinach, roasted red peppers, havarti), but I was in the mood for a classic. It was hearty and filling, but not one of these odd monstrosities that seem to be common now. It all stayed together as I was eating it. It was served with really nice citrus wedges. The biscuits and gravy are the best! Hubby is a b&g snob...none of this \"gravy with a sausage patty\" or sysco will impress him. The serving is large (3 biscuits) and the gravy is so, so flavorful. Meaty, spicy, savory. Then we found the hot sauces (by the water/silverware), which appear to be homemade. We sprinkled on the smoked sauce and it was the perfect compliment. 

Service: The staff was super friendly, helpful and patient. 

I can't wait to go back! I'll have a pastry and he'll have those beautiful b&g again."}

So go! (And this is coming from the guy that would make love to Breakfast Sandwich #2. Imagine how hard it is to stray! So deliciously hard.)"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place when I was in the neighborhood waiting for my car to get repaired nearby. I got breakfast sandwich #2 and a vanilla latte. Very pleased with both! The breakfast sandwich came on a deliciously buttery biscuit and topped with hooks cheddar (yum). They guys behind the counter were also very friendly and welcoming. The space is somewhat small with only 6 tables but nicely decorated with fresh tulips at each table. Would definitely come back to try the homemade pop tarts and the biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"What a treat. On a motorcycle trip we were overwhelmed when making the mistake of trying to eat in the college area. This charming place was in more of a low key area. The breakfast sandwich was really unbelievable, one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"A must stop place every time I'm in Madison.  The pop tarts are a must and the breakfast sandwiches are always good too.  Please add Pour over coffee to the menu."}
{"text":"Given that I now visit 4 & 20 about once a week and have never had a bad item from their menu, I'm bumping them up to a very well deserved five stars.  Great food, great staff, all day breakfast.  My kind of place."}

With a return trip to Milwaukee set to land me at lunch by noon it was after another early morning run that I showered, packed my bags, and headed out into the suddenly rainy weather for the first of two breakfasts - my first stop at 4&20 Bakery & Café, the small shop on North 4th Street sprung from a duo of L'Etoile alumni. Cozy and clean with modern décor borrowing from the CB2 catalogue it was just as the doors unlocked at seven o'clock that I made my way in and with nearly every pastry still warm from the oven a sizable order was placed, one item requiring kitchen preparation while the some were started on at a small table with the rest saved for upcoming drive.  Obviously benefitted by an early morning arrival with a full selection of fresh pastry it was in a duo of scones that my tasting began and featuring a soft crumb far more \"American\" than most Brits would prefer I'll simply say that in this case I fully support the stars and stripes, each buttery bite only lightly sweetened with berries allowed to shine.  Moving on to a golden morning bun tightly wound about a springy center of cinnamon with more than enough sugar to spare and next to coffee cake that literally melted on the tongue it was finally here that my entrée arrived and with house-made raspberry bread rendered crisp by custard plus a hot pan my tastebuds swooned, a duo of fruits dueling for center stage while streusel added a bit of crunch.  Taking halves of each scone to the car along with chocolate wafers sandwiching smooth cream it was perhaps my lone regret that I did not order more - the \"World Peace\" cookie, Blueberry Pie, and Oat Fudge bar all appearing tempting as well."}
{"text":"Cosy cafe with great food. 
The pumpkin French toast is to die for, and the chai latte was so good we had to get another to go. The biscuits mad here are perfect. My only complaint was the sunshine reflecting off the parked cars outside through the big windows was bright."}
{"text":"Even though this has already been reviewed a ton, I feel like it is still almost a \"secret\" sort of place. 

Everything we ordered was packed with flavor, seemed exceptionally fresh, and made sense together. As far as individual items - the biscuits were fantastic, the bacon was perfect, and the homemade pop tarts were ridiculous. 

As others have mentioned, it is tiny. That being said, it didn't feel particularly packed or super loud even though it was full. I imagine that prime breakfast times it may be better to grab a sandwich or pastry to go as it would probably be quite a wait though. 

I'm pretty happy to have come across this place and can't wait to go back. I love it, but I keep forgetting it exists!"}
{"text":"Breakfast biscuit sandwiches are to die for! Biscuits are decadent and always fresh. Asparagus cooked perfectly. When you get it, it doesn't look like it'll fill you up, but it does. Only negative is the atmosphere. Very boring."}
{"text":"I moved literally 2 doors away from 4&20 and my only complaint is that it closes too early (2 pm)!  I feel pretty lucky that a place with friendly staff and food that is fresh and simple yet unique!   I came here once before I moved to Madison and it was great then.  Today I had the squash, mozzarella, eggplant and arugula sandwich, a piece  berry pie and a chocolate chip cookie...yes, I am full!   My Dad, who is not a café/sandwich eater type had no idea what anything was on the menu......but he later told me that he had one of the best sandwiches of his life. Now that's a compliment!"}
{"text":"The relaxed atmosphere masks relentless attention to detail in the food.  Ingredients, seasoning, and preparation all shine through in each meal.  So many coffee shops, brunch houses, and breakfast diners either pile on the starchy fillers or the sweet-and-fatty goo.  In contrast, 4&20 offers modest portions of real food that leave you sincerely satisfied and contented.  If you want couches, comfort food, and gentrified hippies, maybe Lazy Jane's is the place.  If you want great food in a smaller venue and a more up-and-coming vibe, 4&20 has a lot to offer."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch and we ordered a slice of strawberry/peach pie, quiche lorraine, and goat cheese & apple sandwich.
Pie: Good.  Fresh and not too much sugar added.  It was admittedly odd hearing the owner say \"they are huge, caricature pies!\" same as said in Isthmus/Cap Times reviews 2x (is that their slogan?)  The pie was tasty and did have a sufficient amount of fresh fruit flavor.
Quiche Lorraine:  Served with clementine slices, good, not particularly notable.  La Brioche has better quiche.
Sandwich: Herbed goat cheese, Granny Smith slices, fig jam, and pecans on a ciabatta style bun.  Essentially a sweet sandwich--my SO liked it enough that he bought ingredients to replicate at home and make for lunches at work.
I give this restaurant 4 stars because I can't identify anything wrong with it, but it doesn't quite qualify as \"best restaurant ever!\" either."}
{"text":"A very nice small cafe. The ingredients are always so fresh, so as the coffee. This place never disappoints me."}
{"text":"Got here within three minutes of closing and they were very nice and encouraged me to stay and eat. So I did. Ordered the biscuits and gravy, with an egg on top of course. The portion was huge and so was the flavor. I've had my fair share of biscuits and gravy in my life and this one was up there in my ranking. Thank you and I will definitely come back to try more of the menu next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I was so glad to find out that the food is delicious, reasonably priced, and interesting. The location is terrific for my wife and I, right across from East High (behind Milio's), so that was the only thing that could have kept this place from becoming our new favorite local cafe. Corona's Cafe in Florence will always be our #1 in the World. The breakfast sandwiches were ready quickly, tasted great- nice spice and terrific, local ingredients. Their pastries are really nice too, with a decent variety to choose from.
Check out www.facebook.com/semperpie for daily updates to the menu and space."}
{"text":"Everything I like in a local eatery comes together in this little bakery.  It's a great addition to the neighborhood, with friendly staff and homemade treats and meals.  I had a really good orange scone, yummy coffee, and a yogurt mixed with blueberries and topped with amazing homemade granola.  4 & 20 is awesome for breakfast, so I can't wait to try out their lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Scott & his team hosted a fabulous bridal shower for my dear friend. They provided a lemonade bar (with delish, unique flavors), and an incredible menu with soup, salad, and great sandwiches. And, of course, a homemade cake with a beautiful decoration. Overall, Scott & his team were accommodating, & generous. All the girls couldn't stop raving about it!!!"}
{"text":"It is a serious misfortune for those who have not yet experienced the #2 breakfast sandwich at 4&20. 

If Shakespeare were alive to compose another play, it would no doubt document the intense emotions and frustrations of individuals who are barred from experiencing this sandwich in all its glory. 

It all starts with a buttermilk biscuit. Made from scratch, this biscuit is fan-freaking-fluff-tastic. Think of a pillow that tastes like butter. This is the biscuit. Now top this with scrambled eggs, crisp bacon, tons of melted Hook's cheddar cheese and, here goes, some roasted squash. You've got a winner. The roasted squash adds a delicate sweetness to what would otherwise be overwhelmingly savory from the cheddar and bacon. What's more, it provides a moist texture that compliments the breadiness of the flaky biscuit. 

To call this sandwich beautiful would be an understatement.

Also, don't leave without grabbing a morning bun. It's the mother of all morning buns and it will change your life. For better or for worse. I say better."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped by here while we were in the neighborhood. It was a great experience! Their food menu had a lot of great options but we were there for the biscuit sandwich. There were a number of add-ons available for sandwiches that let us customize our meal. It was nice to see the prices for additional items clearly listed on the menu. As for coffee, I liked their simple offerings. My latte was delicious! It's relieving to find a spot that won't pump your coffee full or sugar or make a sandwich with overly processed ingredients. Also, the prices were very reasonable considering the sourcing and quality of the food and coffee. Thanks for a phenomenal breakfast!"}
{"text":"The fruit pop-tarts are soooo good. Real fruity fillings and sweet buttery crusts, almost like a light shortbread. 
I had the seasonal quiche today and it was scrumptious--cheese, corn, and jalapeños (but not too much for my tender Midwestern palate), and with a side of fruit and small green salad."}
{"text":"So cute - total hole in the wall. Great for literally anyone to stop in and have great coffee or delicious breakfast food. Haven't tried lunch or baked goods, but I'll definitely be back to check it out!"}
{"text":"Biscuit #2 with grilled summer squash, bacon, egg and cheddar = perfection! Vanilla latte and citrus black iced tea are both delicious. Great service."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  It was fun to visit, but it is not a place where you can sit for a long time, not without feeling guilty for taking a up a seat, which makes doing the crossword sort of hard. Word to the wise, if, for some reason, you need to need while you visit their bathroom, the toilets bubble violently when the another bathroom flushes...it's the kind of service you don't want seconds on!  It's a little tight and not all that warm (neither temperature or atmosphere wise) but it has a nice, independent vibe and good food.  We both got the breakfast sandwich on a biscuit.  I'm from the South, so I have a pretty fixed idea of what a biscuit should be and this did not quite live up...not that it tasted bad or anything, I just wouldn't call it a \"biscuit.\"  In any case, I wish I could get out there more often!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop that I was able to get some work done in for a couple of hours.  Their house made granola and yogurt has good flavor and hits the spot.  The coffee is also quite delicious (2 cappuccino cups were had)."}
{"text":"Try the Cuban. By far one of the best Cubans I have ever had and l'm from Florida!! The service and atmosphere is near perfect. Will definitely keep coming back!"}
