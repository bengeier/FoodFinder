{"text":"Come here for a perfect cocktail. No syrupy mixes, no bottled lime juice, no over-sugared blue-tinis.

The service is good, although you might have to wait for your drink. On the one rare occasion when the server forgot about our table for a while, she paid for our drinks before we even had a chance to complain (not that we were even going to complain).

Nice gluten-free appetizers, too. Maybe don't come here for a meal, but try the food with your drinks."}
{"text":"I love their drink menu!  Full descriptions so I know what I'm getting into.  The drinks cost a lot on paper, but there is a lot of fancy booze that went into that glass. So to me totally worth it. 

I've been a couple of times - the place is always packed on weekends, yet the hot hot server is insanely competent and always gets our drinks right. She is a gem. 

Sure you can buy glutino pretzels at superstore for a fraction, but you aren't going to get this fun-times atmosphere in your living room."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are fans of REAL Long Island Iced Teas, so we thought we'd check out what Avenue Magazine tagged as Calgary's \"Best Cocktail\" over at Milk Tiger Lounge.  The atmosphere was really mellow, dim lighting, and there was good tune-age.  After confirming with the friendly bartender if their Long Islands were the real deal, we sat in the corner and awaited our drinks.

The Hardy Boy book cover menus were rad, and I just LOVED how they had the little paper pocket inside the \"book\" which held a card with their drink and soup feature.  Resembled that of an old school library book you'd sign out from elementary, except the contents were much more riveting (Gimlet, Harvey Wallbanger, Old Fashioned, etc).  

I could have done without the obnoxiously ear piercing laughter from the girls beside us, and the prices were a little steep, but it's definitely a great stop for a fancy cocktail night out on pay day.  

The DJ was really good, my boyfriend pointed out a Kurt Vile remix, which is always impressive. 

As for the Long Islands, we enjoyed them but found a lot of sugar settled at the bottom, which made our last sip a little unpleasant."}
{"text":"We usually end up here on a Friday evening. The drinks here are unbeatable. There's a cocktail for every taste. The atmosphere is great with the music and the cool or quirky artwork on the walls."}
{"text":"Absolute love!!! Their cocktail selection is mind blowing, and they don't skimp on hard to find ingredients. My friend was super happy to find out they're totally gluten free.

I found out about this place through a cocktail blog when I was trying to track down a bottle of creme de violette - it was popular back in the 1920's, but it's almost impossible to get today. I think there's only one liquor store in town who manages to bring in 6 bottles a year, not only do they never see the shelf but they only sell it to bartenders they respect and like.

Even if you don't like 'cocktails', there will be something here that will blow your mind and make you feel like dancing like Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald. The bartender REALLY knows his stuff, and that only comes from experience so ask for a suggestion if you are a cocktail newbie. I am sure you will fall in love."}
{"text":"No tvs make this a destination for me on a Friday or Saturday night, especially because it's in my neighbourhood. Excellent bartenders and menu. Drinks \"seem\" expensive but remember they are doubles, people! Good music/djs. All in all a standout in the Calgary cocktail bar scene. Ming?? what's that? 

Gets loud after 8pm.

Menu is ENTIRELY gluten free and extremely yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This is a neat place that I have definitely walked past many times without knowing what it was. My friend and I wanted to get dressed up and catch up over cocktails so we arrived at 7pm. A good time to get there to avoid having to yell over the noise as the place gets quite loud nearing 10pm. Or at least it did on the Monday night we were there, so I can only imagine what the weekends are like. We'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Calgary is becoming such a bore with the same old spots, so when I learned from an insider of this place I was sold. A purely cocktail bar, genius! Its tucked away on 4th, so you have to look out for it, but it is worth the search. 

I went with a friend and grabbed a seat at the bar. The lounge is dark, really quaint, and plays some trendy tunes. It has a real NYC feel to it, and the decor is simple yet conversational. In terms of atmosphere, I wouldn't say hipster, because I've been to Analog on 17th and lets be real I don't think the Calgary \"hipsters\" every leave that spot. Its just a cooler, more industry crowd at MTL. 

The cocktail list is nothing short of unreal. They have tons of drinks for every type of liquor you like. I just asked the bartender for one of his favs, and it was amazing. If only I actually remembered what it was called. It was an orange, type martini. Unreal, and I am not a huge cocktail drinker because I find them all to be too sweet or too strong. But this drink was a great balance, and created the right amount of buzz (also note, lightweight). Drinks are expensive so it's a great place if you are just looking for a few and a cool spot to hang. I didn't try the food, but I will be back and try something on that list, ie. cheese platter) 

The staff is super friendly too, and I am sure could conjure up any sort of crazy concoction you wanted! The people were friendly too, randomly chatted to a few guys beside us and they were telling us about some other hidden gems in the city. (ie where to meet hot single guys that don't only want to hang out at National).

This is a must stop in Calgary, but I do hope it doesn't get too popular because I think the charm is that not too many people know about it. Apparently they do not advertise at all, and its been around for 4 years, pretty decent for the turnover this city sees. Great spot, for sure. Do note, I am rebounding because Classic Jacks (don't judge we all love this place) really seems like it's gone for good (sigh)."}
{"text":"When you're on the prowl for something a little different from Calgary's lounge scene...something a little less typical, a little more sophisticated, something that still feels intimate and comfortable, fresh....check out the Milk Tiger Lounge.

You may miss it when you look for it. It's a concrete wall with graffiti tag art beckoning you to come look within. But if you knew the old Bar Named Sue location, you'll know where to look.

The owners are friends with experience on the scene. They're savvy and they want you to enjoy your evening, hipster New York indie style. The decor doesn't get in your face; it's woodsy, sheik, monochromatic and has masculine art & fixtures that women will raise an eyebrow at. You'll wish for more colour but you'll fit right in if you love wearing neutrals. Wallflowers beware: don't wear red! And some of you will wish you wore that fedora you don't know what to do with as you croon over everything from indie to lounge to jazz. The sounds are revitalizing in their old-school approach. You'll definitely purr.

They work hard behind the bar to bring you drinks that challenge your usual experiences with a little bite. Expand your repertoire with classics like Tom Collins or a Pimm's Cup, tickle your fancy with a Champagne Cocktail or stick to the small but particularly chosen beer menu. Offering food up til 11 pm, this is quality for a trendy tongue with cheese, meat & crostini platters, perfect with wine. Or be a lil French and try the a la carte selections of Petites Bouchees (little mouthfuls) like bocconcini wrapped with prosciutto or spaghetti & meatball on a stick.

You won't be disappointed with Milk Tiger if you're looking to join up with a friend or two (best kept to smaller numbers as space is very limited) for good conversation and sophisticated but unpretentious tastings. I even got asked out on a date while patronizing. Yes, dreams can come true. 

Oh, and don't be shocked when you find the bathroom is somewhat co-ed. We can all be friends at Milk Tiger. Meowwww."}
{"text":"Small, crowded, and stunk of hipsters.

The cocktail list reads like a bartender's guide - not a single innovative cocktail on the whole thing, just the standards - and all the cocktails are made with well liquor instead of premium. I guarantee I do not want a gin gimlet made with Beefeater for $14. The caipirinha, allegedly cachaca, was definitely spiced rum and lime juice from a plastic squeeze bottle. 

Avoid!"}
{"text":"With the huge influx of pubs popping up around Calgary, and beer isn't your thing but cocktails are, where do you go? Milk Tiger!

I've been on a secret mission to find an enjoyable Pimm's Cup, and I believe I've found it here! I'm not one for ginger beer, but Milk Tiger does a good job balancing the flavors that the ginger isn't overwhelming. 

Take a step up to a more sophisticated rum & ginger, and order a Dark & Stormy.

I think mixology is an art, and the bartenders here have definitely mastered that art."}
{"text":"Gluten Free MeatBall Sandwich! Yum! Great drink selection. My stomach was upset, so the waitress recommended a ginger ale & bitters, and my nausea went away before I left. fabulous stomach ache an hangover tip."}
{"text":"I happen to have been at Milk Tiger twice within two weeks, like I'm some kind of regular or something... wait, why aren't I a regular or something? 

Milk Tiger is a little lounge that if you didn't know it was there, would probably miss. There's little to no signage save for a small, white, stylized tiger over an inset door beside a closed in balcony. Make sure you look hard when you're headed there or you'll be liable to miss a great little spot with a wonderful cheese tray!

I have become addicted to the French 125 which is 5 ounces of wonderful mixed with champagne. (They do however, need to work on their pims.)

Although Milk Tiger has made it's name on it's classic and unique cocktail list, I have to say the TSN turning point for me is the food. Pleasantly, the menu is gluten-free without being snobby about it; it's just a good menu that pays attention to taste and variety. The cheese platter is excellent, the tacos very good and the salads quite nice. I would have liked a bit more spice on my nuts, but let's be fair, who doesn't like spicier nuts?

The staff are super friendly and know their menu well, making the experience at Milk Tiger one that keeps me coming back; apparently weekly.

{"text":"On a ridiculously hot day in Calgary we stopped into Milk Tiger (What's with Milk being so ubiquitous in Calgary?) for some cocktails. With temperatures over one hundred degrees fahrenheit, every patron was on the patio melting in the sun. We shook our heads, marveling at Calgarian's need for heat, and walked into the empty interior of the bar, nestling into a couple of bar stools. The bartender greeted us with a smile, and we ordered two Pimms, the perfect compliment to a hot day. The bartender's name was Christine, and she was wonderfully engaging, informative, and entertaining. We had a great time, and Milk Tiger seemed to be the epitome of a great Calgary bar; no pretense, good drinks and friendly, happy conversation.  We soon forgot about the heat."}
{"text":"Awesome, go here see it for yourself . The first to do the speak easy and only one to do it justice . They make their own bitter for ch*st sake . Check it out"}
{"text":"It's Quaint, Quiet and conversational.  The drinks, at first glance appear to be expensive but they are all doubles, and premium ones at that. Despite my lack of dentures, a hearing aid or a chrysler Concorde...I do enjoy a fine scotch from time to time. I had my finest here and have been back a few times when im in the area. I think that it's a perfect lil joint for a birthday party or small work gathering, a date, a barmitzvah or a briss. The staff were friendly, the MUSIC WAS SUPERB, location is walkable. 
It can be a wee bit non-descript due to lack of signage, which is also very esthetically pleasing

chiggy check it"}
{"text":"After years of walking by and meaning to go in, I've ended up at Milk Tiger twice in recent weeks. Both times were awesome. This is a very, very dark bar, and a little cramped, but it's cool spot. I'm not sure what I was expecting -- the unmarked door with only a white wooden tiger above it makes it seem secretive and ambiguous, but it's a surprisingly casual place. The cocktails they serve are incredibly delicious, and the service is awesome. I've been here both to get the night going, and to wind down after already rowdy ride. An excellent stop on both occasions. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I like that this bar doesn't display their name in front of their establishment. You gotta be in to know this lounge.

They serve unique drinks. The price is slightly steep. But their drinks have a nice punch to it (taste and alcohol hit). 

I was with a group of 10 people, and we took over their outdoor patio. Small, but did the job. 

I would definitely come back. A nice mix up from drinking beer and to the usual National/Craft outing."}
{"text":"In the past I've only ever been to Milk Tiger for cocktails - and it's been great.  To go tonight and learn that they have an ENTIRELY gluten-free menu was a dream come true.  The food was delish and the staff was super knowledgeable.  For sure, it's my new go-to place!"}
{"text":"I'm a soul music lover, so imagine my delight when I walked in to soulful music being played at Milk Tiger Lounge. I was in heaven instantaneously.

The space may be a little humble with small tables, however the bar is long and the cocktail menu is most impressive. The best part for me personally is their incredible selection of gluten-free food! I had NO idea that they even served gluten-free options and when I saw that almost everything on their menu IS gluten-free, I was sold for life!

The bartenders and staff are exceptional and make great conversation.

It's official - I am a fan of Milk Tiger Lounge. Old soul, delicious food and great conversation. What else can you ask for?!??!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Milk Tiger, I didnt particularly like it. It smelled funny and everything seemed dreary. But the second time was very enjoyable. 

I'll admit it, I'm not a cocktail person. Maybe some mojitos once in a while, but majority of the time I like sipping on wine. And occasionally beer or an aperitif, depending on my mood.

So the huge cocktail list at Milk Tiger is never a draw for me. But the atmosphere is really nice. It is always packed, usually with good-looking, well-dressed people. (Seriously Calgary, it wont hurt to dress up when heading out for a change!) So I feel at ease when I walk in in a dress or heels or anything fancy. 

Last time I went, I was very particular and asked for an amontillado sherry. They didnt have anything like that on their drinks list but the bartender found an Alvear sherry for me and I highly enjoyed it. The cheese plate was a very good accompaniment too. 

Very chill, trendy place for drinks in Calgary. The tiny, almost non-existent signage outside makes it hard to find and that adds a touch of cool."}
{"text":"Awesome Lounge.

The folks who run it are solid, and pay attention to detail.  They also really know their liquor and wines, so don't be afraid to ask for a recommendation.

The cocktails can be expensive, but are always fantastic and they have some excellent and hard-to-find beers on the menu.

It may be crowded, but I find this more of a great small lounge in San Francisco type of crowded than an annoying these people suck crowded.  You're sure to bump into interesting people.

Great place to start or end an evening."}
{"text":"Friday night drinks! I liked the atmosphere inside and the cute little patio outside.

The drink menu is extensive, sophisticated and well organized. 
I like the jumbo ice cubes / \"rocks\" they use so that your drink keeps cold without getting too watered down. 

Drinks are quite pricey (-1 for value), but if they were much cheaper I suppose the place would overflow with business, and who wants that?!"}
{"text":"30/30

Okay. How much do I love the gutted Hardy Boy books as menus? I never went here when it was A Bar Named Sue, but the contemporary, if not overtly hipster-ish changes - i.e., the aforementioned menus, sleek design, bartender with ironic facial hair, Splashdown on the stereo and the name itself, all they're missing is a bear trap - yeah the changes aren't so bad, they just look like they were made based on Tumblr suggestions. 

It was around 6pm and quiet when I was there both times. None of the clientele that the lounge seems to want to attract - just yet. Mushroom and Red Pepper Bruschetta came out pretty quickly and was delicious. Another time I was here, my friend ordered the Taquitos and said they were good. Came out pretty quickly too. I appreciate the fact that the menu is Gluten Free; I can come here with the two people I know that suffer from Celiac's. Don't come here if you're starving though, the portions are pretty small. Which is great if all you want is something to soak up the cocktails you're swigging, but not so great if you've got dinner pangs. 

This is a place I would have no problem coming back to, but it's not exactly a place I would deliberately seek out. The service is good, the food is good, and the cocktails are good... but too much surrounding competition and not enough to entice me to come back."}
{"text":"I like this bar, it's quaint, great for intimate conversations with friends. Drinks are really good.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing. great drinks and vibe..What a Calgary staple/must experience!!"}
{"text":"My 200th review! And I wanted to save it for a place I'd been dying to try forever! 

It's actually a 4.5, but the price is a little steep. I knew where it was, as I used to go there when it was a bar named Sue. But I will admit, if you don't know where it is, it's going to suck. All they have is a black and white tiger above the door. 

I was meeting up with Stephanie S. and the hubs and I got here first. Very small inside, but I already knew that. I did love the fact the entire place is GF! But $4 for pretzels that I have at home, little much. And $8 for vodka orange juice, come on. other than that it was good and I would love to come back and try more food."}
{"text":"Nearly every time I planned or dragged people to Milk Tiger, this place was always packed. Makes sense considering how small the place was.

But since my sojourn to New York I've been dying to go to libation spots like these that give that hidden spot feeling. Finding this place already matches the experience of walking around Greenwich village, just stumble off 17th and look for a tiny white tiger hovering above a near-hidden entrance.

For a consistent 10$ you can get cocktails whipped up for you. It's cheap compared to all the other places in Calgary. The only place I've been to was Beatniqs and I'm not sure it's reincarnated Wine-Ohs would reprise their $10 cocktails. The last time I was here, I loaded up on their Hemingway Daiquiris...Papa always knows best.

I haven't extensively tried their food menu but I had this risotto thing that was deepfried into a pizza pocket. It was gooey and did not taste bad and ruin my night. Jesus what an amateur way to describe something I just ate. I'd check Milk Tiger's website but whats up Milktigerlounge.com? \"Das Wichtigste zuerst\"?"}
{"text":"\"Everyone\" knows about Milk Tiger. Who's \"everyone\"? I've been asking myself that for years and I still don't know. One thing I've learned for certain is \"everyone\" is definitely not everyone. But I am pretty sure \"everyone\" goes to Milk Tiger.

Why are they so cool? For me it's their incredible cocktails. Pricey, but with the level of attention to detail, quality (and amount) of booze they put in, they're well worth it. The bartenders there really know their stuff. For this crew, \"mixologist\" is probably a better term than bartender - their passion for drinks is both palpable and deliciously palatable. 

But when you're one of the cocktail elite, it's just a tiny step sideways to become one of the cocktail elitist, to move across the line from passion to pretension. Milk Tiger sometimes pushes this line a bit much for my liking and as a result I always feel a little awkward hanging out there. Instead of spending a whole evening catching up with friends, it has always turned into a \"stop in for a drink, then go somewhere else\" kind of place.

I think this might be the deal... Could you imagine if you had to deal directly with a 5-star, world renowned chef when placing your order, had a special request, or god forbid you didn't like something you were served? Could you handle the heat?! Thank goodness you have a server there to be your middle man! But when you're dealing directly with savant level cocktail bartenders and one of the people in your group asks for a good glass of wine, don't be surprised if you get told that they don't have any good wine, because it's wine, and none of it is good... Serious? The revered for thousands of years as the nectar of the gods isn't good enough? In this case, I'm not too sure if this was intended to be cheeky fun, as its definitely a cocktails first type of joint, but it made the whole group feel quite a bit less welcome.

It's the cool kid's cocktail clubhouse - to know about it, you gotta know about it. To find it you gotta know where it is. Don't worry, I can tell you - you're on Yelp so I know you're a cool kid. :) Park your car near where it shows on the map and look for the tiny tiger. If you try and spot it while doing drive-by's there's a good chance you'll miss it. Get out of the car, have a look around and you'll be there in no time!"}
{"text":"Jordan mixing it up in Calgary!  If your interested in unique drinks give this place a visit, you won't be disappointed.  Whether you are into old fashioned or Margarita, stop on in..."}
{"text":"I was told this is a great place to have a bartender makes some complex cocktails and was left with a crappy margarita."}
{"text":"Brings me home to NYC. This hits home for me!

I am a speakeasy-esque guy. If you read my reviews, you'll probably see that term 5 or 6 times. This place is the bomb for craft cocktails. I love places that have \"mixologists\" that really take the time to consider palates, flavours, textures, body, etc in cocktails. With that, their menu is great. Lots of thought and consideration has gone into it.

This is definitely a bar for their specialty cocktails. While they do have beer and wine, why would you waste your time coming to a place like this? If a six ingredient cocktail doesn't sound pleasant to you, then this probably is not the place for you.

With our drinks, we had a charcuterie board which was delicious. I think I remember house made pickles? YUM. 

Between the three of us catching up, we had about 3 drinks each. All were delicious. 

This is definitely my swanky, go-to!"}
{"text":"I'm a new yorker. So i have an idea of what a good cocktail bar is.  And this is it. Dont miss your opportunity to stop in!!!!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place to get drinks!

I hesitated to review Milk Tiger because one of the reasons I like it so much is the lack of a crowd. It's definitely a hipstery cocktail bar that wouldn't prove interesting to those looking for a cheap beer though (although they have a couple). Milk Tiger serves some of the best cocktails in the city with a great menu to choose from. As they are cocktails you know they won't be cheap, but that's not why you go! You go for the ambiance and the pleasure of a great drink. They do have a small selection of bites (because they're required to) but I have never gotten any as that's not why I'm there. Entertainingly, one of the options is a Hungry Man brand frozen dinner.

A unique cocktail bar with its own style and great drinks."}
{"text":"A great place to experience good food and exquisite drinks. 
It's pricey but it's worth what you pay. The service, the atmosphere, the food, the drinks, the clientele, everything is classy and exciting."}
{"text":"We met some friends here on the weekend, giving me a chance to finally see what all the hype is about. It was a little hard to find, due to the lack of signage, but I did eventually see that little tiger hanging above the door. The space is A LOT smaller than I imagined, but it was bumpin'...luckily Missy D. was already there and had claimed a table! They had also ordered the pretzels, which were actually really delicious, especially with the mustard that came on the side. I ended up ordering the 'Sweet Tart' cocktail which was DEFINITELY sweet, but actually tasted like a sweet tart candy and was NOT shy on the booze. I really liked how trendy this place was, almost like a hidden gem that only the cool kids know about. We only stayed for one drink as we had dancing to do, but I'm looking forward to returning and seeing more of what Milk Tiger is about!"}
{"text":"I have been pleasantly surprised every time I went to Milk Tiger. Their service, quality of drinks and environment is the best. Not only it is the best cocktail place in Calgary, I believe they can easily compete at world class."}
{"text":"Milk Tiger, you rock my cocktail world. And you rocked my best friend's gluten-free world too. She was so very excited to be able to eat an actual grilled cheese sandwich again! And not only that, it was a fancy grill cheese sandwich with pesto and gouda cheese and everything.

I filled myself up with the cider pulled pork tacos. Three little taco shells filled with yummy pulled pork, a side of nicely diced of veggies for me to sprinkle on at my leisure, and a delicious potato salad were just the right size of meal for my Friday night. The potato salad was especially awesome-baby potatoes coated in a balsamic vinaigrette with feta cheese. *Drool*

Milk Tiger's also got an impressive cocktail list. I might have to make my own passport to try them all. Last night I sipped on a Suffering Bastard to start. When I asked for something made with whisky and that was particularly boozy, MTL made me a Vieux Carre. Boozy it was, just what I ordered. Ooooo, did that ever hit the spot.

We also enjoyed the cardboard deer head mounted on the wall. Nice touch! The rest of the interior is dimly lit, with a couple of tables that work well for groups of 3-8 and also a couple of corner spots that seemed to make for some very cozy dates ;).

I also feel like the bathrooms cannot go without a mention. They're at the back of the restaurant, and there are four doors in a row. Two men's doors and two women's doors. There's a full wall between the middle men's and women's stalls, but only a partial wall between the two women's stalls. The sinks are shared and out in the open. Don't forget to wash your hands. Every one else in the bar will see you if you don't! (And can I just saw EEWWWW!!! if that's the case?)

MTL deserves 5 stars in my books. The service, the choices, everything was wonderful. So why only 4? It's another spot that doesn't seem to take debit, even though they accept credit. There's a cash machine back by the washrooms instead. That point on its own downgrades even the best of places by a star point. *le sigh*"}
{"text":"Tucked away mischievous little joint with creative cocktails like the \"meat hook\" which is a diabolical blend of Woodford reserve, scotch and I can't recall because the room started spinning. Oh ya also tried the lime Marg on the rocks with their own twist which tasted like cancun at 4 am- nothing beats that."}
{"text":"The place feels under staffed with rare visits. I sat on the patio and as an average weight guy went through the chair while on a date having to replace my chair. Funny but pretty ridiculous that the chairs were so trashy. Drinks were what to expect from it but avoid the drink called penicillin at the recommendation of the waitress. It tastes like a burp mixed with a plank of oak. There's really not much seating here and for whatever reason the bathroom layout is all kinds of ridiculous open air to the bar lol. Fortunately, I was on the patio a long way away and the bathroom was clean.The venue itself is pretty boring and has a lot to be desired. As others have mentioned the pricing for them is for sure on the higher side so if you plan to have a night out it's going to cost you."}
{"text":"Did you know that Milk Tiger is almost completely gluten-free? You can get a good looking sandwich there (haven't tried, obviously), but if you can't eat wheat, you'll want to check this place out. They don't market themselves as gluten-free, as I doubt anyone could taste the difference. 

The waffles are good, hold up to the ice cream, but don't feel like bricks. The meatballs with rice pasta are meaty, with a nice slightly spicy tomato sauce. They've come up with interesting ideas, like little \"tarts\" on rice crackers, that I've started doing at home. Finally, the gluten free brownie is a chocolate bite of goodness. 

I would recommend the food to everyone, because it was so good, but if you have to eat gluten-free, I would recommend GOING RIGHT NOW. Bonus: their kitchen is open past Calgary's standard \"only 'til 8pm\" so you can eat great, late (sorry for the lame rhyming).

Drinks: they aren't cheap, but they are quality. There are some great cocktails on the list, so think proper-lounge as opposed to let's-get-effing-wasted (I can see why this wouldn't be appropriate for a hen party).  I say worth it, as not too many places have a good French75 in town."}
{"text":"Dark, loud, too many of them young kids, and the drinks are expensive. Also, they don't really make a real Long Island Iced Tea, at least when I asked the bartender. Maybe I'm just funny-lookin'. 

Anyway, pretty stannnndard lounge. None of them duelin' pianos or anything. Too much cutesy too. From the Hardy Boys menus (I loved the Hardy Boys when I was a lad) to the weird washroom set-up. I went once for a couple drinks and never went back."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and decorations in here. My friend and I were excited to check this place out but were surprised when the sign outside said 21 and over? We went in with no issue though so we figured it was to make sure no rowdy kids found their way in. Definitely a more sophisticated vibe! It was an awesome experience. Check out the neat cross stitched sign outside the washrooms."}
{"text":"It's soo hipster in here. Of course I'm not hipster, but I actually do like the environment. The drinks are fab and the snacks are pretty darn good. I would definitely order a cocktail if you are planning to visit. Mind you, they do also have quite the beer selection. Perfect spot to just chill out and go for drinks. Their patio is small and cute, you'd be lucky to get a seat out there though."}
{"text":"Great cocktails!! ... They made delicious cocktails... Probably one of the best cocktails for a bar in town ... Other than that is a small place with an ok ambience... Good to go for drinks!!"}
{"text":"Milk Tiger was recommended by a friend of a friend for my trip to Calgary. I went on a very slow/cold Monday night. Milk Tiger has really fantastic drinks, and great service! I was able to try some drinks that I never thought I would like (The Dirty Pigeon). I would highly recommend Milk Tiger for a casual drink!"}
{"text":"One of my friends had her bachelorette party at Milk Tiger a few weeks back.  Even though the party was a huge success and everyone had a pretty good time, I just don't think Milk Tiger was my favourite place to hang out.

I found the place to be too cramped for my liking.  Every time I wanted to go outside or to the other side, I had to ask half a dozen people to move out of the way.  There were bodies everywhere, crowding everything.

I found the drinks to be quite expensive too.  I mean, I had to spend a bit on some shots and whatnot (for the bride-to-be) and it seemed to rack up quite a bill.  Even the beer was a bit pricey.  It was just a bit too expensive for me.

I do really like the exterior of the place.  I had a hard time finding it at first because the exterior signage is spray painted on.  I just thought it was pretty cool.

So I had tons of fun at Milk Tiger, but mostly because it was a special occasion.  On any other occasion, I wouldn't suggest Milk Tiger as a great venue."}
{"text":"We found the Tiger based on some other yelpers suggestions.  So thankful they shared.  What a gem.  If you enjoy a good cocktail I do not believe there to be another option.  The staff or owners that work here clearly do it because they are looking to push, challenge, and enhance there own skills.  These folks are really mixologist who from what I could tell take a great pride in their craft.   

The drink options are from another era.  Some are the old classics with a modern twist.  From days when horse racing was a family event.  Others I have no idea how they found them.  But I loved them for it.  The options went on for page after page.  

When you order one they set to work on preparing it.  Selecting from a wide array of high end bitters, liquors, herbs and lab equipment.  All without the pretentious overhead of some high end bar.  I do not recall any of the staff so much as glancing at a cheat sheet on how make any of the drinks.

I got the sense that anyone that worked there was a very seasoned bar keep that was tired of filling pint glasses and making old fashions, classic martinis, and Manhattans.  They folks wanted more and that is exactly what you will receive at the Tiger Lounge.  

Go there.  Experience a drink or two made by a real professional.  I don't recall what we spent but it was worth every dollar for that level of service and talent."}
{"text":"Enjoyed coming here on a Saturday night to chill and have some cocktails post dinner.  Surprised to find it not too packed at 11 p.m., easily got a table next to the bar.  Waitress was awesome, suggesting drinks in a methodical way (by booze you liked or if you prefer sweet/sour).  It's not cheap, but the value is their for the quality of cocktails - had 4 and with tip I think it was $50.

Must say, whomever is in control of the music in this place is an ace.  They were rocking some great hip-hop that is not super mainstream, cheers to you DJ!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love. This place. The entire menu is gf and very tasty! I was so excited to see they make aviations.. my favorite old school cocktail."}
{"text":"I love going out with friends, having a few drinks, catching up on what is what, but a plague in most Canadian pubs and bars are the televisions! Flashing sports updates and commercials, you try to tell your friend this ridiculous thing you overheard someone say but are interrupted as you watch their eyes glaze over and their gaze float above your head. You are now fighting for their attention with the television.

Hey guess what, no TVs at Milk Tiger! And I may want to cuddle with their logo, just a little.

Not only are there no TVs, but booze ahoy with a delectable menu. I recommend the Blood and Sand, Suffering Bastard and the Dark and Stormy cocktails. I went to Milk Tiger on a Saturday night and watched as it went from being near deserted at 9:00 pm to mosh pit packed from 9:40 - 10:30  then back to spacious and then full again while listening to the DJ spin some LPs.
This hipster haven will class you up, sass you up and feed you some gluten free eats (I had one smoked salmon nacho and it played real nice with my tongue).

You a lumberjack, Paul Bunyan reincarnated? The waitress brought my most hetero friend his drink in a long stemmed glass, as she put it down she looked at him, went, 'I will go get you a manly glass and not make that mistake again', brought it back in a tumbler with an ice cube that could of sunk the Titanic. Needless to say my friend was pleased.

I will be back, hopefully at a less happening time so I can enjoy the food menu and more drinks."}
