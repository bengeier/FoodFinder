{"text":"I've driven past Le Chien Chaud many times, but had never gone before. One of the best things about it - it's really fast! I went there with my 2 year old and my mother-in-law right when it opened at 11. We had barely settled in at our table when our food was brought out. This was great as my little guy was starving!   He ate the kids dog which is the same as a regular sized hot dog cut lengthwise with toppings of your choice. I got the chicago dog with I loved - all the vegetables makes the hotdog almost seem good for you. My mother-in-law tried the breakfast dog, which she said was delicious.  The restaurant has a bright and fresh look. It has a few tables (more than I had expected seeing it from the outside. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"wanted to do a food weekend and this place was on my list, had my family whit me in toe. I ordered the cony island dog, it was good great taste and fresh full of flavor.  my wife and son ordered a kids dog, simple dog and mustered.   my dog was worth the price but the kids dogs were over priced for a dog, it was good but i could not justify the price."}
{"text":"I didn't try the food and let me explain why.  I was with a group of friends waiting to be served and there were 3 people in front of me. We waited there for 5 minutes and the line stood still.  Only 1 person is working doing everything.  That means service will be unbelievably slow.  I eventually walked out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally tried Fat City Franks, the food was good, a little pricey for a meal of hot dogs. $37 for the two of us. Next time I would skip the sides, I didn't think the potato salad was anything special despite being featured on \"you gotta eat here.\" The Chillean was good but had a bit much cilantro on it. The Mediterranean was really good and the milkshakes were pretty good as well. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"You look at my two star rating and think, Arc how dare you decimate a mission staple! Sure, I get the fact that it is important to support our independent restaurants, but I wouldn't have integrity if I didn't give you my sincere thoughts. My two star rating has nothing to do with the decor of the place. Dig that 50s/60s diner look. The service is a little slow, it appears that only one person was on duty though it was a busy Saturday for them. Also, I am of the opnion that the most important part of a hot dog is the dog. Drown it in whip cream if you want (now there are some fun connotations) or in my case feta cheese, hummas, olives and one sprig of parsley (when the picture clearly covers the dog in parsley), but what's going to take it to another place is a flavorful, juicy, I-can't-get-it-anywhere dog. Sadly, the dog isn't up to snuff in my opinion. It feels like something I can purchase in Safeway versus something from a local butcher shop. The price I pay justifies demanding the lather.   It's a good location so no doubt they will continue to sell, but I likely won't be here often. I had the Buffalo Mediterranean dog with Boylan's root beer for $10.76. I am sure most will disagree with me, but this place makes me want to stay home and make my own dogs."}
{"text":"I went here, because of the glowing reviews. I have to say I was a little disappointed. I tried the dog with quacamole, cilantro, and  your regular stuff and I have to say $6.00 for a hotdog that's not even grilled ?   My four year old, that also had a plain hotdog with nothing on it (just a weiner) also paid $6.00    $24.00 for four hotdogs is a lot of money. The restaurant itself is small, with only a handful of tables. They do have two tables in which you are able to seat 4 people. When I was there, one table for four had a couple sitting at it and the other table had just 1 person sitting at it. I was stuck eating at one of two of the higher tables with my kids. They also have a hotdog like cart to the right as you enter. It has extra toppings like relish mustard and ketchup. The same sort of stuff you would get on a golf course at the halfway house. I don't think I will come back here, nothing really said \"wow\" that was awesome !  To be honest the hotdogs are better at Tubby Dogs IMHO."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, really good food and great location.  I had the French Hot Dog, delicious mushrooms and gruyere cheese. Loved the taste. I experimented putting a bit of pineapple curry chutney on the side and it blew me away. Friendly staff, clean premises. The only down side - not enough options for soft drinks, besides some 'weird' ones. I would love to see some plain old cans of Coke or Fanta...."}
{"text":"I had walked by a few times and never paid much attention but when an out of nowhere hot dog craving hit, Fat City popped into my head. I am so glad it did because it was outrageously good. It's a hot dog, how good could it be? I love hot dogs as much as the next person but its a tube of meat on a bun. Well not here it's not. You have an assortment of meats to choose from, I went with the basic hot dog. It was juicy and tender, probably the most perfect hot dog I've ever eaten outside of Costco (what's up with Costco hotdogs? Those things are incredible). Then the assortment of flavors, I went with the French. It had sautéed mushrooms, gruyere cheese and Dijon. What a treat. Our party also ordered the German and the Coney Island with the '1/2 pound of meat' farmer sausage. All dogs got a huge thumbs up. Now I've got a pretty hearty appetite and really wanted to try another dog but knew I wouldn't get all the way through it. I couldn't talk one if the guys into splitting it with me and the thought of even a bite being wasted was enough to make me shed a tear. Great place, great food."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Winnipeg, a city known for its many classic hot dog eateries going back 80 years or more. Sadly when I moved to Calgary, there wasn't one to be found until maybe15 years ago. I've always found that a bit strange.  Fat City Franks doesn't serve the classic style hot dog, but rather a jazzed up version on steroids...make that several versions.  I've been coming here since they were known as La Chien Chaud nearly 10 years ago. I understand why they changed their name...probably got tired of people asking; \"what does La Chien Chaud mean?\"  My favourites are The German (sauerkraut, mustard & caraway), and The French (sautéed mushrooms, herbes,  gruyere cheese.& dijon mustard). The imported Boylan's soda pop is a nice change too...especially if you're getting bored with the same 'ol Coke and Pepsi products sold by most establishments.  The price might scare some people away (now over $6 each), but they are quite filling...as I stated at the beginning of my review, \"not the classic style hot dog\", and this refers not only to the variety of ingredients, but to their massive size as well.  One suggestion; French fries!!!...but I suppose the hot dogs are a meal unto their own, right?  Oh yeah, the staff and owners are very friendly!"}
{"text":"What an adorable hot dog diner!  They've been here for 9 years, and today marked my first journey into Fat City Franks.  Let's face it, the hot dog is a brilliant invention. It has has a texture and flavour of basically, well, nothing! This makes it the perfect vehicle for whatever you you want to dress it up with, and Fat City Franks has a full hot dog wardrobe!  You can go with the classic all American ball park dog, or dress it up with toppings from around the globe. Mexican dogs, Chilean dogs, French dogs, all the dogs! I went for a Mediterranean dog sporting artichoke hearts, olives, and hummus! It was... Well it was interesting. All the ingredients were fantastic, but somewhere deep down inside I think I wound up longing for a chili cheese dog. Which given the fine quality of my weirdo olive hummus dog, the chili dog Is bound to be top notch. I'll be back to try it, as long as my sense of adventure doesn't get in the way and I order that delicious sounding Taco dog."}
{"text":"Another great hot dog joint. A little healthier (as far as hotdog places go), if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Good-bye Fat City Franks.  The owners have retired and packed up shop.  For those that will miss this place as much as I will.... they plan to keep doing the stampede grand stand so you can get your fix 10 days a year."}
{"text":"If they're on that tv show, \" You gotta eat this\", it's gotta be good...but after all the eating, I mustered enough room for that \"vintage milkshake\" as listed on their menu.  Ordered the chocolate, it's good, but not worth close to $7.  I'll be more than happy to pay that @ Boogies ;)  Good sized place run by the husband/wife team.  no amex."}
{"text":"Where can you find a hot dog piled high with creamy hummus, artichoke hearts, tangy olives, feta cheese and fresh parsley?  How about rich and creamy guacamole, mayo, chopped tomato and onion, aji sauce and fresh cilantro? Or even one with potato and cheddar perogy filling, sauteed onions, sour cream and bacon?  At Le Chien Chaud.  My friends and I wolfed down the above, also known as the Mediterranean, the Chilean and the Ukrainian (in that order) along with a couple of malt milkshakes (chocolate and strawberry).   At just under $6 a dog, make sure you show up with an appetite in tow. By the time we were done we were mighty full, but mighty satisfied.   I'd be doing Le Chien Chaud an injustice if I didn't mention the small town diner service with a smile. Remembrance Day proved to be a great time to show up, we were the only ones in the joint and well taken care of.  Next time I'm going for breakfast (cream cheese & chive, scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and bacon)."}
{"text":"I had the Canadian dog and it was sooo good. Juicy dog, fresh buns and generous toppings! The coney island is just as yum! The meat sauce on top was so delicious!   Don't forget to order the milkshake too :)"}
{"text":"The dog was juicy and hot fresh, I would not stop in now with out getting the potato salad, simple, fresh, tasty. I was down to a bite of each and the potato salad was the one I wished a had a couple of bites left. nice simple lunch."}
