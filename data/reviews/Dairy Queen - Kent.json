{"text":"Yea worst service ever and consistently the worst, but I guess they are consistent at least.   The staff is disinterested ans seem overwhelmed though they aren't busy. There is barely any acknowledgement of your existence let alone any appreciation.   I usually only stop in for a Julius....not sure I would trust them with much more."}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen's service is terrible, the young lady that took our order was nice enough but the long haired kid in the back had no manners bringing out the orders, he walked up, hat on brought down on his face, & basically dropped the food in front of us and walked away. Even when we said thank you he wouldn't acknowledge us. Not that you expect awesome customer service from a fast food chain, but this was over the top."}
{"text":"Hmmm, I think this place needs more reviews because they've gotta have a ton of happy customers; it's always busy!! I bet we get take out here almost weekly since they've opened (picky kids that just want chicken fingers). And we've eaten inside or on the patio more times than I can recall. All in all it's a great DQ! The food is what one should expect from any DQ. And they've expanded their menu over the years, my kids love the $2 pretzel sticks. The fresh sandwiches are decent and who doesn't love a good blizzard with a ton of mix ins!!"}
{"text":"Not the best ice cream shop around but far from the worst either. I personally don't care for any Dairy Queen's ice cream as it is too gritty & flavorless for me. This time around I tried a coffee mocha flurry and found it flavorless and disgusting. I ended up throwing it out about half way through...it made my stomach feel like crap for the rest of the night.    The location itself is clean though & they are adding a fireplace & living room like atmosphere so I'd be willing to give them another chance but maybe try their pretzel sticks this time around. Staff wise, their all teenagers....their only going to be so attentive/knowledgeable; they were quick to take my order but not quick in making it. Again, not terrible just not worth going out of your way for."}
