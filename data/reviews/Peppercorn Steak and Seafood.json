{"text":"came here with my family of 11. The places inside is really nice and cozy
We ordered some chicken dishes and it was tasty but the portions were so small that my husband had to eat again when we got home. We also ordered two different kinds of pastas and they were both really bad, couldn't finish it. Also got salmon which wasn't that good. i have to say their dessert was thr worst. It says on the menu its a chocolate mousse cake but when it came to our table it was just store bought chocolate cake.
very disappointed,  would definitely not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Server was extremely helpful with suggestions. Tried their signature halal peppercorn steak with Cesar salad. My buddy had the same with mash potatoes instead of fries. Steak was ok, a bit more rare than medium (I had asked for medium rare). Didn't have enough peppercorn! The classic retro glass coke bottles were a nice touch. Place was quite packed even at 9pm!

Mash potatoes and fries were bland as were the Caesar salad, but I wasn't obviously going there for sides; strictly for halal steaks! Given the increase in halal alternative restaurants in the area, one visit is enough."}
{"text":"This place has great food and reasonable prices.  The ribs are amazing!  Service is great as well.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a cute family run restaurant. Lots of seating available for big parties. We were attended to quickly, and explained the menu where needed. The food was not only visually appetizing, it tasted great as well. We ordered the chicken cordon blue and chicken parmigiana. They were both warm, flavourful, and juicy. I would recommend the chicken parmigiana more. Our server was really nice and kept coming back to ask if we needed anything. The overall experience was nice and we will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"My first time here tonight with my daughter. Food was deliciously Devine.  Wings was awesome; steak was surprisingly tender and juicy; we were welcomed with a very nice appetizers. Tried different beverages. 

The service was amazing, very warm and welcoming from the time we stepped foot into the restaurant.

{"text":"I ordered the 7 oz steak medium well with Ceasar salad and steamed veggies. 

Meat came raw with blood in my plate. 

Garlic bread was cold. 

I sent the steak back -- the chef cooked it and returned it with the wrong sides. 

Extremely rudeness
Food was bleh 
Meat raw
After we paid we were asked to leave immediately 
Rude and angry chef

I was very upset at his unprofessional and rude manner.

This place needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"Went with friends for a late nite bite. Ordered the 12oz peppercorn. Its a casual and halal version of keg. Service is great. Food is on par. 
The only problem we had was with payment... you have to stand in line at the cashier to pay once you are done. 
Besides that.. definitely a place i will visit again."}
{"text":"Okay so this place needs serious work. 

We ordered a chipotle beef burger and a steak on the bun. 

The server did not ask how we wanted the steak, and responded that 'we make it well done always'. We requested for it to be a medium which still came out as a chewy well-done. 

Fries were extra oily. Meat on the burger was over-cooked and did not deem 'chipotle' at all. 

I asked the server why there is no music playing, and they responded by saying \"music?\" :/ They dont play music. The next time they came back to check on us was when we asked for the bill. 

To top it off, I felt embarassed when the server announced the amount of our bill half way across the restaurant. And while making the payment, we were invited by the server to come back and try their signature peppercorn steak. Being a steak lover, we asked the server what kind of cut it is. Sadly, they didn't know the answer and told us to check with the chef. 

Nothing peppercorn about this place. Notttt going back!"}
