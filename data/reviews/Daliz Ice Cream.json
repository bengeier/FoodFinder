{"text":"I've been here twice before and both those times were better. Recently I went for the 3rd time and was really unhappy. We ordered a burrito, nachos and hot dog to go. We were waiting when about 3 families came in for ice cream. All 3 employees were running to help them which is fine we didn't mind waiting at all but come to find out our food was left cooking that whole time and dried out terribly. The burrito was so dry when they rolled it, it literally crumbled and crunched. Why didn't they just heat up another tortilla and redo it?? I don't know but it was like eating a giant pile of chips. The filling was dry too, rice and beans and meat were all over done. Nachos were soaked with chile and toppings so once we ate the few solid bites they turned into enchiladas. The hot dog was OK but again, left on the grill so one side of the bun was burnt and crispy and the other just warmed. I will return to give them another chance but PLEASE take your time if the customer says they don't mind waiting and sit down to wait patiently please make their food to the standards you used to. Very disappointed but will give them another chance."}
{"text":"This place has all your munchies taken care off!! I recommend The Torta cubana and la chilindrina"}
{"text":"So put donuts and mexican food and you get this excellent establishment. Sounds strange but PLEASE NOTE that they are each their own entity. It used to be just the mexican side and then somehow they merged. I only ever had their donuts,coffee and donut side drunks nothing on the mexican aide.  DONUTS - they are the best. Rainbow or Bosa don't compare. These are fluffy yet soft. Bosa and Rainbow sometimes are flat or lack flavor. But These guys know how to make donuts. My favorite is the Tiger Tail and butterfly. They are the fancy kind but worth it. No one else makes them like these guys. Try it and trust me you will like them. However all their other donuts are quite delicious. I try other places and always come back to comparing to this establishment. They got the perfect formula going.  Coffee - it's actually excellent. Don't know what brand they use but its fresh ground and its tasty.  Boba - nothing negative about it.  Customer Service - its a Cambodian couple who are very humble and nice. The woman is jumpy and talks to you and appreciates your business like no other place.  Like i said i cant speak for the Mexican offerings but trust me try their donuts and you will be hooked and willing to make the drive."}

{"text":"Ice cream was good.  My kids enjoyed it.  The two ladies behind the counter struggled to understand my order.  It was two strawberry and two hot fudge sundaes.  They gave us two with vanilla and two with strawberry ice cream and all 4 had strawberries and chocolate sauce on each one."}
