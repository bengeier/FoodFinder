{"text":"Customer service was not good (nobody was friendly) and our almond milk lattes were not hot. Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"In a word: neat.  The person I was meeting was late, which gave me a chance to peruse the wall-o-wine.  Good coffee, parking kinda stinks, but overall nice little hang out.  It makes me want to show up with my laptop so I can look like I'm doing something important while quaffing top-rate coffee.    Okay...Yelping."}
{"text":"This Barrique's location (the newest of 7) is standard for the local chain - good lunch fare, good pastries, good selection of wine, comfortable space with a variety of seating options and spaces. And the location on the prominent corner of  Atwood Ave. and Dunning St. is a recognition that this area of Madison is getting recognizably cooler.  It's relatively new - they've been open about two months - and it seems like they have the bugs worked out. Service is adequate, fireplace is cozy, and not awkward. The atmosphere feels like new construction, and hasn't been seasoned like a great Third Place, though it has the potential to become that. It would just take a little more thoughtful build-out, instead of so much plain wall.   I'm already a regular, but the one thing they need to address for regular customers is the music playlist. It's been the same 30-40 songs for a couple of weeks - 70s, 80s, 90s pop, which is fine in doses, but in the age of Spotify and XM it's kind of an oversight.  Bottom line - its not the BEST coffee shop of the 5 in the area - that depends on what you're looking for, but it's the best mix of comfort, atmosphere, service, and tasty."}
{"text":"Decent coffee and food and they're not one of the annoying cafes that refuse to offer a 20 oz cup to go. There were a couple nice people there awhile back but too many snooty attitudes now. Cargo Coffee is friendlier but it's a good second choice for when Cargo Coffee is closed."}
{"text":"We had a cinnamon bun that tasted like it came from the three day old cart at Walmart.  The wrap we had was mostly spinach with a little bit of egg.  There was a miniscule amount of cheese on one part. On the other end was some sort of green mush, that I can only assume was the advertised avocado. I do not struggle with hipster-ism so the industrial type decor did not resonate with me, however it was done well so I had to give the second star.  If your looking for breakfast and you don't need the artistic atmosphere, then go to McDonald's and ask them to microwave a salad... It would probably taste similar."}
{"text":"pleasant location w/ good places to sit and enjoy your coffee or your wine/drink.  various small rooms so a measure of privacy.  the coffee drinks are excellent, as are the pastries. very cordial staff; i have never had the problem w/ waiting others describe.   however, the sandwich i ordered - grilled cheese - was truly awful.  i could not get it down and had to throw most of it away.  one tiny strip of cheese on the bread - toasted w/ no butter.  in other words, two slices of bread toasted on the outside.  skip the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and coffee! They also have a nice selection of moderately priced wines. I like the little study area. It tends to stay fairly quiet for studying."}
{"text":"So happy since this moved to the Atwood neighborhood. Great service, very friendly staff. Plenty of wine tasting events. Enough space to sit. Definitely my favorite Barriques!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place for coffee, spirits, wine and chocolate in Dane county.  The quality of coffee and great service are consistent. Always a pleasure to work, have a meeting during the day or simply hang out."}
{"text":"You will really like Barriques if you go on a good day. Otherwise, you might not be impressed. I have been there enough times to see both, so the inconsistency is why I am giving this place 3 stars.  Wine, Coffe, Bakery and small menu sounds great, right?  Their coffee is usually pretty great. They have some delicious wine choices as well. However, it takes an inordinate amount of time to get food considering what they serve (soup, salad, sandwich). The food is usually pretty good, but not work waiting 30 minutes for a salad, I feel. The bakery is hit or miss. I just had an incredibly good chocolate raspberry cupcake that I HIGHLY recommend, but their scones are sometimes burnt.   Overall, Barriques is a 4-5 on a good day and a 2 on a bad one. If they sped up service and became a little more consistent, it could be really great."}
{"text":"I got the June special caramelo cooler and wife got the iced chi tea. Bother were great."}
{"text":"This Barriques would get 4 stars like what I would give to the 2 other Barrique's I sometimes frequent. The food and drink is comparable to other Barrique's. The service is actually better than the service on Park Street. The major problem is the temperature. IT'S A SAUNA! They obviously need an HVAC person to come in and fix it. I spoke w/ the manager and it is a fundamental problem w/ the system, not just an isolated incident."}
{"text":"I end up at this Barriques bi weekly for an amazing iced almond milk latte and treats. But something has happened recently and their sandwich game is terrible. My friend got the saddest grilled cheese sandwich (it looked like they buttered it with a cheese spread) and tomato basil soup (which tasted like a chunky marinara sauce). And the following day I purchased the turkey club sandwich which promises avocado and applewood smoked bacon  for $8.50. I received neither on my sandwich. What I saw instead was a slim amount of what I would call an avocado spread and one very pitiful piece of normal bacon. I will attach a photo and you can decide if this is in fact false advertising! Fix your sandwich game Barriques Park St! The Monroe St. location seemed fine the last time I was there. And the employees and iced almond milk lattes are always on point! 5 stars for the employees!"}
{"text":"Still a 2-star joint. The coffee is ok, the pasties unmemorable. But the food is really a problem. I tried an avocado wrap today. If I had known it was prepared at some point some time ago and then microwaved, I would not have bothered. It was warm and rather filling, but that's it. The avocado and tomatoes had absolutely no flavor, but the wrap itself had an unpleasant aftertaste that lingered an hour or two.   An ok place for coffee, altho it is cramped and poorly laid out."}
{"text":"Great, sunlit place where you can stay as long as you like! They also have a cave-like seating area with warm incandescent lighting if you prefer. Their drip coffee is strong enough to be gourmet, but somehow the way they brew makes it not quite as strong as I like. (I prefer their espresso drinks.) Delicious wraps and interesting wines, if you're into that. Hassle-free parking compared to the location on West Washington!"}
{"text":"The staff here is always exceptionally kind to me, even when I have to stare at the menu to figure our what I want.   I tried the German chocolate cake specialty drink and it was delicious, rich chocolate, coconut, and expresso is a very good combination.   The breakfast sandwich was about fist sized, so a bit small, but the egg was just right and toasty. I would have liked more cheese though. But I always want more cheese!"}
{"text":"Great coffee! Love the belly card! The set up isn't the best though. Requires sunglasses in one room with a lot of wobbly tables...other room is comfy but too dark. Staff is great and I love having a local barriques..but other locations have better vibes than here"}
{"text":"Stood in line (if you can call it that) - one person in front of me. Three employees behind the counter. Waiting... waiting... waiting... ... ... waiting. The person ahead of me ordered one (1) coffee drink. Their transaction was complete. Three employees behind the counter still. I'm still waiting... waiting... waiting... & waiting. At this point I'm about to say fuck it & walk out.  Suddenly one of the three employees sees me & offers a lame excuse (thought I was with the person ahead of me, who only ordered one drink). In all, I was waiting just about 7 minutes at this point. So the ordering & transaction were fairly normal until I went to pay. Apparently, they're not taking debit - a generally accepted currency these days at most normal low to moderate volume businesses. They do take credit however (cuz I want to pay interest on a cup of coffee for the next two years). Luckily, I had cash. Unluckily, Barriques did not. I got a few fives & a shit ton of quarters back for change. I was offered an apology, but I didn't accept it. I won't be going back. I believe, for one cup of coffee, I waited over 10 minutes. Unacceptable.  The coffee was terrible. My wife & I are coffee fanatics - so we know what's good. This tasted like the nasty drip coffee at her 90-year-old parents' place.   Starbucks in Monona never failed me, so I will gladly drive to a place, where even when there's a huge line - I'm served faster than when there's one person ahead of me at Barriques."}
{"text":"I am sitting here right now waiting for a hummus wrap. They called our name and only gave us half of our order (my partner also got a wrap). The only good thing about this is the location and space. Lots of places to work - different rooms, fireplace, strong wifi, large, etc. However, this is my third time here, and I don't think I'll be going back. The service is super slow - as in it took about 15 minutes for crab dip. The food is NOT good. I don't think you should offer food if it's that bad. Just stick with the coffee and pastries. Seriously - the crab dip was dry with big chunks and horrible crackers. The egg sandwich leaves something to be desired - one lonely egg on a 1.5 inch diameter dinner roll. I could have eaten 5 of them and still been hungry. It also took another 15 minutes for an egg nog latte - a latte. My friend had been here before and said the service is really slow. It's not that hard to speed up service - I used to be a barista. It's all about who you hire. Really a shame since it's in a great location in Atwood, but I will be going to Zoma and Chocolaterian instead."}
{"text":"I love this place been here a couple of times best Mexican hot chocolate ever at least in Wisconsin that I know of the girls that were working that day were really friendly and fun"}
{"text":"We have been customers of barriques for years, going back to when it was just on Monroe street and mostly focused on wine.  As it's transitioned to more of a coffee house and expanded across the city we have followed it, visiting many of its locations.  Coffee is consistent.  We visit them more as a family and less as a date night now.  The disappointment comes from the change of the yogurt parfait.  My 10 year old has been eating them for a good 8 years but recently (in the past few months) the parfaits have changed into a sugary mess and downsized considerably.  We don't visit barriques as frequently anymore because of this change.  We would like to see the old parfaits come back!"}
{"text":"SOOO barriques. As some of you may know... I FREAKIN LOVE BARRIQUES. I must hold down my excitement to review this particular location though. Barriques coffee, tea, and treats? EXCELLENT  This particular location has a lot going for it and some not so much. The things I like most about it, is the location and the interior. This location is found right smack dab on the corner of Fish Hatchery Road and Park Street which is a HUGELY traveled intersection near downtown Madison. Plenty of sitting space, some comfy chairs and even a darkened area that seems... I don't know, quaint. It isn't super busy every time I have been here but it isn't dead either. Staff has been sometimes inattentive and once or twice downright rude but it only happened once or twice so I won't hold it against them. They also have an internet area in the back I think. I tend to stay toward the front of the store so I am not sure but I thought that was a really nice addition. 9 out of 10 times the store is spotless and finally it isn't cramped.  Now onto some not so nice things (Sad Face). So the things I dislike most about this location are 1. the bathroom, and yes I know it seems mundane but if you read some of my other reviews this can make or break it. It isn't always as clean as it could be to put it nicely.   Another issue I have, Ironically enough, is the location. I know I said I enjoy the location and I do but it is right on the main drag so if you are there on a nice summers day or around 8:00, 12:00, or 4-6:00, all you will see is bustling traffic. Which, if you are trying to relax, is not the first thing that springs to mind. The other issue is that it doesn't seem to be as busy as it should be for being where it is. Why isn't that place packed all day! The reason I have found for this is that there is not much parking without walking a bit, which is great in the summer maybe or if your younger, but not so much in the winter. There is street parking but it is regulated so much that you would end up moving your car anyway. They have about 6 spots along the back of store but thats it.  So because I love their coffee and atmosphere so much this place gets a difficult 5 stars. The reason if because I don't want to have to park on a greatly busy street and cleanliness of the bathroom. Otherwise? Great staff, Free WiFi, Great coffee, Great Decor, Great Food, And Great Coffee... Oh did I say they had Great coffee too?"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and people are friendly, but the food delivery system is very inefficient.   When orders are complete, the type of food or patron's name is called.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is very loud.  I have seen food sit on the counter for as long as 10 minutes with no attempt made by staff to find the customer that ordered the food."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee shop in the Atwood area right off the Capital City Bike Loop. The baristas are super friendly and the coffee is nicely roasted. My go to is either a drip or americano, two drinks that are hard to mess up, but two drinks that can taste awful if the coffee is bad.   Barriques also has wine and beer of that suits your fancy. They have a wall of 100 wines with the customer favorites ranked. A neat idea that sets it apart from other more traditional coffee shops."}
{"text":"Parking is a bit of a nightmare, but I can see why the place was packed with locals mid-afternoon on a Saturday. The baristas were friendly, there's delicious looking baked goods, they have beer on tap and a quaint, quiet but fun atmosphere. My iced coffee was delicious. Not sure what else you could want. I'll definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"I will give credit where credit is due and Barriques has improved since my previous rant about their frequent kinks in reserving their semi-private space. Whew! So that's been a relief, they have been pretty consistent about posting signs and helping politely advise other patrons that the space is reserved when they are sitting in the room.   I still love the light-filled atmosphere but this place still remains pretty darn s.l.ooooo.w with the food/beverage service on most days I'm in there so I stand by the rest of my prior review! Regardless, I'll keep heading back because it's right around the corner. I'm a sucker for proximity."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee shop, my favorite in Madison, even more than Collectivo. I like this location the best, even though all are good. I go NUTS when they serve lobster bisque YMMM"}
{"text":"This is a great place to read, meet with somebody, or just relax with some great coffee. I'd recommend their Miel and their drip coffee."}
{"text":"Barriques - Overall, I've been loyal for years. 6 or so? You do coffee so well, 90% of the time. Your food is great, I love the menu, but the end product isn't always so consistent or appealing.  The staff is fun and seems to have fun with the work.Thanks for always being so nice to me, and (seemingly) genuinely chatting about my day and being willing to talk about yours.   Whether it's a morning pick-me-up, post-work doppio to prepare myself for an evening of activity, a work meeting, stopping in on a Friday for a bottle/glass of wine, or just a rainy afternoon, Barriques can hit the spot. I just don't have anything overly critical or bad to say.   I owe a lot to Atwood Barriques:  Morning walk commutes to work, coffee and breakfast sandwich to-go  can be a real lifesaver!!"}
{"text":"Caffeine- YES, Same great business- YES! Character- YES! Convenient location- YES! I am a fan of all of the Barriques and I love that each one has its own character. This one is in a fun spot right on the corner of Park and Fish Hatchery Road.   Love all the fine visual details they put into this building.  Tons of industrial elements; wood accent walls, gears, metal, and glass give this location a cozy feel without being too hipster.  It has two main areas to sit, the wide open main area and a cozy nook that will make you feel like you are sitting in a big tree house.  Yep, it's your own club house for people that like caffeine.   As always, the coffee is spectacular and consistent.   They have some of their yummy food options here too, which is great for on the go or grabbing a bite to stay the afternoon. They have parking spots, around 8 or so max.  That's the only problem if the lot is full, otherwise I have nothing but great things to say about my favorite local coffee chain."}
{"text":"I love Barriques but this is my first time at this location. They have two rooms, one with natural light, and one with great ambience and warm lighting. Tables are around the edges of the room with outlets, which I love as my laptop dies quickly. Lots of room and a decently sized parking lot for the location."}
{"text":"I needed a spot to do some work and Barriques was conveniently near by. It's a nice little spot to get some coffee or tea and a light meal.  The store is divided into three rooms.  The main room where there's the coffee bar and order your drinks, and it had booths to sit in. A small separate room with tables and chairs, and some board games to play.  The third room had an open garage door so you could get some fresh summer air and the sounds of traffic.    It was oddly quiet in there as most people were sitting there doing work on their computers.  Even the people there just having a conversation were fairly quiet.    I ordered a tea, and the pork quesadillas.  The food was great.  The real money maker was adding the chipotle sauce to dip the quesadillas in, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum."}
{"text":"Barriques is my go to coffee shop before work in the morning, or to bop around in if I have a few hours to myself. I love the recent menu revamp with the grain bowls they added, and service/coffee/atmosphere has always been great.  I recently met with Jesse at this location to talk about renting a room for an upcoming bridal shower I'm throwing, and he was very helpful and accommodating (plus the room rental rate is a steal!)."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today with my sister and absolutely loved it! It's so cute and funky and has something for every coffee and tea lover alike. An absolute cherry on top was the wide selection of gluten free options for my sister who is celiac. Absolutely love the wall of wine and defiantly plan on coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have an excellent tea selection and the atmosphere is phenomenal. Great prices, friendly staff! I hate the parking at this location but it's worth the hassle!"}
{"text":"I am not sure about this location yet...  The atmosphere & ambiance is nice. So is the location near the bike trail. I found the food to be only\"so, so\"  but to be fair, they were out of the main ingredient.... scrambled eggs.  Not sure how you offer a breakfast wrap featuring scrambled eggs, and be out of scrambled eggs... they suggested substituting a fried egg round In it's place... Just wasn't the same.  Maybe I will give them another chance some time... but for now, based on this visit... 4 stars for décor and the ambiance vibe, 1 star for the food... ?? For the service...one was nice, one was a little condescending & not quite as helpful..."}
{"text":"We tried Barriques this past Friday because my wife and I like to talk on our date nights. The place we normally frequent (on east Wash) has taken to playing loud music. I found the service to be somewhat perfunctory, but chalked that up to overzealous expectations from our prior establishment. We felt the environment to be warm and inviting. The coffee (I had a magnum latte) was exquisitely decorated, and tasted delicious.   We will be back."}
{"text":"In the two days that this Barriques has been open, I've visited twice. It truly fits the atwood feel with its open concept, warm feel and welcoming fireplace. There is plenty of booth space, plus lots of tables, a bar, a separate room that can be reserved for small groups, and a a very open, bright, warm atmosphere. There is a state of the art espresso machine that makes your coffee come out perfectly, with the help of a very talented team of baristas. There are some grab and go sandwiches, along with made to order options. There is also a wide selection of baked goods that are baked fresh every morning. This is easily one of my newest favorite cafés, and I cannot wait to come back often for study sessions, hanging with friends, or relaxing after a very long day with a craft beer or glass of wine. Way to go, Barriques Atwood!"}
{"text":"Barriques has been my favorite coffee and wine shop in Madison for years, and I was thrilled to have a new branch open a block from my house. I'm a teacher, and I've spent a lot of my summer down time reading and working at the Atwood Barriques. The staff are friendly, the iced coffee is delicious, and the food is tasty. And the wine selection is great, as well. What's not to like? Only the fact that every so often there aren't any seats available!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've always had good experiences at the McKee Rd. location. This review is specific to this location.  The cashier was apparently new and managed to enter one of our orders incorrectly.  The barista not only took fifteen minutes to make two lattes, they also made them completely wrong, and licked their fingers while making the drinks. This was such a disgusting lapse in basic food hygiene that I will probably never come back."}
{"text":"Found a new hang out place when I'm in town! I passed this place a whole lot of time in the past but I finally decided to stop in. I needed a place to park myself and do some work, and I thought of it almost immediately.  When I came in, I saw a very attractive blonde gorgeous lady cop getting an iced tea. I am no lesbian but I could see her being in some guys' fantasy. Cuff me, officer. Cuff me now.   I digress..  I don't usually pay appreciation to the same sex beauty but I guess it was one of those days. That's why my reviews are solid as I give credit when credit is due.  The place was cute and first thing I looked for was electrical plugs. I saw a bunch and I felt instantly at ease. I ordered my cappuccino. I was disappointed they didn't ask me if I wanted a real cup or to go as they gave me a to go cup. I wanted a real mug and planted myself there for at least a couple hours.  It wasn't a big deal though. The coffee was delicious! I was more than ecstatic over it. The place was great for people watching too. They had all kinds of activities. There were two older women reunited after years not seeing each other. There was a job interview going on right in front of me and this lady teacher that had red hair and freckles are teaching salsa dancing. There was a cute guy dressing like he rode his bike there, and he's all alone. I was hoping he made eye contact until his less attractive girlfriend showed up. There were students studying, people on dates drinking wine. There's a lady in a lululemon sweatshirt that I wanted and she ordered a breakfast dish that smelled so good. There was a girl with a huge braid made of tiny strands of more braided hair.  I had some stuff done but it could have been a lot more if I didn't get distracted with the interesting stuff around me.  I checked out their wine selections and it was pretty cool. I even picked up a bottle of Viognier to go.  Low points were they had a dingy filtered water dispenser that need to be replaced. They didn't have Stevia for sweeteners, and though I was grateful they had parkings, I was worried sick if I would curb it and scratch my wheels. It was so cramped and tiny. But all was fine. Lastly, it was rather hot inside. I didn't know why they didn't keep it cool and comfy. I also got bitten by mosquitos inside.  So drank coffee, people watching, work, and trying to kill mosquito and scratched my legs half of the time. I'll come back in a heartbeat!!"}
{"text":"I love Barriques. They have good coffee, wonderful ambiance, free wi-fi and tasty food. Plus you can always grab a bottle of wine and some cool funky home decorations while you are there, talk about multi-tasking. Even my hubby who doesn't normally drink coffee will do an iced coffee when we go. Hmm, just writing this review is making me think that I should head there soon and work from there today!"}
{"text":"Not my absolute favorite Barriques - of the few I've been to I think the Fitchburg and Monroe St locations are a bit more refined and carry a wider variety of goods for sale. The basics remain the same: coffee,  wine, food - just not as many varieties at this particular spot.   However, as a cafe, the Atwood Barriques does just fine. There are a lot of tables and three different seating areas. It is an especially good cafe to study at or get work done, because it is fairly quiet, has free wifi, room so as not to feel cramped,  with the added bonus of hot sandwiches and coffee.   While I haven't tried them personally, some of my friends are obsessed with their breakfast sandwiches to the point of buying them almost every morning.   Interior is designed along an industrial, raw exposure theme, sort of like the original Colectivo cafes in Milwaukee. The accents and light fixtures are cute and kind of funky, featuring gears and caged light bulbs.   In short,  what really matters is that they are open late and are a convenient place for laptop work."}
{"text":"Barriques has these bangin' to-go boxes that fit a whole lotta food into one small brown contraption...    I was discombobulated and in a bit of a rush walking into Barriques for the first time ever.. I was on a quick break from work and had to be back ASAP....  I'd never laid eyes on their menu before and I was a bit lost, I admit... I may have been a tad annoying as I was so obviously not familiar and at the register trying to figure out my order in about 2.5 seconds....    I had the grilled cheese with french onion soup, chips, and can of soda to go.  The food was yummy, and I will definitely return for more of that goodness - but they get three stars for now because the girl at the register had crap customer service.  She was not trying to help me, instead she was very obviously annoyed... and maybe she enjoyed that I was lost... Instead of telling me what kind of chips they had or telling me about them, she simply pointed and stared blankly at me....    C'mon dude!!  I wasn't trying to be a pain, I was slow because I'd never been before....  It was a good opportunity for customer service and it was lost."}
{"text":"I love coming here. Tasty coffee, calming atmosphere  and always great with friends who don't mind you drinking their coffee. I'm just assisting you."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Barrique's.    Madison has no shortage of coffee shops with free wifi.  Most coffee shops in Madison are friendly to students, accommodating with outlets and Barrique's is no exception.  What makes Barrique's my regular haunt over other coffee shops though is their tea.    I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to good tea.  It's difficult not to be a snob when my dad is also a tea enthusiast and I've grown up drinking tea he personally selected and brings back on his trips to China and Taiwan.  I really can't fault coffee shops for serving tea not to my standards.  They are, after all, COFFEE shops, but when they do offer tea that I enjoy, I can't help but become a regular.  Their Jasmine Pearl tea is what I most often go for.  I enjoy the Park Street location because it's well lit, with beautiful windows."}
{"text":"I've only ever had the whole milk latte at the West Wash location and they do a nice job with it! I've met up with out-of-town friends here because of the hipster vibe and fun location (Sunday AMs are fab because of the ease for parking!!!). The handful of times I've been here, service has been prompt and good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops in Madison. Good food and coffee.  Sometimes too busy, but usually a good place to study and drink coffee. Typically excellent service."}
{"text":"I asked the hippy looking girl working the register the same question 3 times. She refused to answer a simple question regarding one of their sandwiches so I just ended up going to Subway. This place is filled with low IQ scores."}
{"text":"The new frequent buyer system is SO bad. And the barista who waited on me yesterday was rude when discussing it. When I told her she was speaking to me in an inappropriate fashion, she then argued that she wasn't."}
{"text":"I like this place a little more than most coffee shops in Madison...they have a good variety of soups/sandwich selection and their tea selection is a notch above the rest. Two things have me holding back on the 5th star: parking and clientele. Parking can be overlooked, except that the clients seem to come in and sit for hours. Many bike here, but too many do not. Also - they really have some loud, verging on rude, conversations. The hipster element is a little too much at times."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops in town, love their alcohol infused drinks. Nice and neat ambience, have multiple rooms which is good for studying or hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Perfectly adequate is a good description for my one visit  I ordered a cappuccino and a breakfast sandwich (on a Saturday at about 9am).  Let's talk about the cappuccino: It was extremely burnt tasting. I don't want to judge it too harshly because, it was the first and only time I've been there, but I it was unexpected.  Breakfast Sandwich: This was great! It was very simple, just an egg with really good cheddar on a roll. And it was less than $3. Better than an egg McMuffin to say the least :)  It was not busy at all when I went, but there is lots of seating, so it would have to get very busy before that would be an issue."}
{"text":"I keep wanting to like this place and waiting for things to improve, but location is only thing going for it. Food doesn't seem up to par with other Barriques, they seem understaffed, and for some reason they don't like opening the garage door on nice days. :/"}
{"text":"So I specifically go into this Barriques because I get a notification from their frequent buyer card that I can get a free cookie. Great, I think - I'll go here instead of another place - their promotion worked! I get coffee and request their gluten free cookie. No, says the staff, you can only use that for the regular cookies. So I verify - I can use this coupon for the cookie that is $2.65, but not the gluten free cookie that is $2.20, even though it though it says nothing about that on the coupon? Yep, they say. If you choose to have a special specifically geared toward getting customers who haven't visited back IN your store, why would you send them away? Because that is exactly what this did for me."}
{"text":"I like Barriques in general but this location has not impressed me. Slooowwwwwww service, even at hours where a quick in and out is important for most people (I was ordering in, and my drink took 10 minutes and sandwich 20; I saw another woman in line have to wait 10 minutes for regular coffee she could've dispensed herself, though!) The HVAC system makes aggressively loud noises when they're roasting coffee, presumably because it's sort of a warehouse feel and so it's not well insulated - it sounds like you're sitting under a jet taking off. Delicious as ever, but the ambience and service here? No thanks."}
{"text":"I like Barriques ok...I usually stop here when I'm hungry, low on caffeine, and have some extra time. Or if it's 8:50p and I really need wine. Ya know. Pros: their food is really pretty good. My favs are the breakfast wraps and the pulled pork quesadilla (just don't bother with the grilled cheese). And, you can get food with a nice side of greens! Their drinks are pretty good (could be stronger). Also, there's good wifi and tons of electrical outlets. Cons: food always seems to take a lot longer than it should (I'll admit I'm usually hungry when I'm here). The other big con I have here is how they tend to shout out your name when your food is ready. I get it, they have to let you know somehow, but I can think of a few other options. Overall, service is good but not great.   I'm really between 3 and 4 stars here...but today was a 4 star day (the girl behind the counter was especially nice), so 4 it is!"}
{"text":"This place is fine is you want beans or a bottle of wine but if you need the staff to make something, you might leave disappointed. This location is so close to home I've tried it a couple of times. The first time was so slow I left before ordering. Today I ordered a Mexican Hot Chocolate - an order that was first screwed up (and had to be remade) and finally unsatisfactory. It just tasted like hot chocolate. I think it will get better as the training of the staff has more time and improves. Lastly, the design of the space has several cool spots to sit and read/talk/drink but the check out is crowded and confusing."}
{"text":"Solid local Madison coffee shop chain. Go-to spot for coffee and wine, have always had a pleasant, professional, and friendly experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee and a delicious cinnamon roll! A great way to start the morning or kill time in advance of an appointment. Barriques never disappoints."}
{"text":"The same old, the same old - why does the barrique service so slow during 80% of my visit? That coupled with unenthusiastic cashier always makes me a sad panda. The redeeming part of barrique is that they are open until 9pm. That I can appreciate. This one on the Park St also opens at 6:30 on Saturday, and I appreciate that, too. But other than that, why would I come here when I can go to Cargo."}
{"text":"After not being at a Barriques for a very long time we decided to give this location a try. I like it very much. The decor is nice and inviting. We received good service, the internet was good, and the people watching fun. I had a frappe and a slice of lemon poppy seed bread. Both were really yummy. The music is nice, not too loud. Parking could be better but that would be my only complaint."}
{"text":"Barriques has reliably good coffee, rich and well brewed. They have honey and real spoons at the fixings stand, a big plus for those of us picky people who can't stand defiling coffee with sugar or wooden stir sticks. Their lunchtime offerings are surprisingly good, as well. An extensive wine collection pretty much covers one wall. I don't know of any other place in town that carries Zapp's potato chips, a treat from New Orleans. Nice place to hang out, and it works for business meetings, too. Solid 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"really bad coffee that sits out all day. very expensive for what it is, employees don't care. corey is very rude and literally lies to customers"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. They have a whole salad menu with several types of salad. I ordered the waubesa with mixed greens and lots of yummy stuff, and added some chicken breast. The salad was super fantastic. I've been here for coffee, which is also good."}
{"text":"Well doesn't this Barrique's location have just the best customer service EVER! If you know me well, you know I drink cold brew 365, so when cafes stop carrying during the months it's obscene to sip something cold, I make it at home, using a pound of Full Bore from Barrique's, 10 cups of water, and two-ish days steeping in a dark corner. I'll cut that 50/50 with water and that pretty much fuels me from December until May. Here's the thing, on my last visit, the machine mutilated my beans, whereas almost every other time I've picked up a bag the ground has been a tad course. I pointed it out to the barista, she showed her manager, and within minutes they were grinding another pound on a different machine. They explained that although the machines get pretty regularly services, sometimes things can be out of whack. I was appreciative they were willing to give me a do over, a level of service and attention that'll keep me coming back! (Now if they could only brighten up that dark little room. When tables up front are full I go into full sleep mode pulling up a chair in the darker of the two spaces.)"}
{"text":"I was very excited to see the east side was getting a Barriques.  Despite having a few cafes nearby (Zoma, Victory) there just seemed to be something missing; namely a good place to grab a drink and a breakfast sandwich, and sit down to read or do some work.    The newest Barriques will be pretty familiar to anyone who has been to one of their other locations.  Same menu, similar look and feel.  In addition to food you can shop a small selection of coffee & wine themed gift items and their wall of wines. If you're new to Barriques, sign up with Belly, their rewards program (also good at a number of other Madison businesses).  Where things are hit and miss right now is the staff/customer service.  Despite always having a number of people behind the counter, service is SLOW, and if they're working on another order good luck getting the staff to even acknowledge you.  I walked out a couple of days ago after waiting a few minutes with a steadily growing line behind me without having a single employee look up from their tasks or greet us.  I'm hoping this is just growing pains and the customer experience will improve."}
{"text":"Just awful. Middleton store isn't bad at all.  East side the employees are apathetic and piss poor baristas.  First visit, I stood at the counter for just over two minutes while two employees talked in the back. I made several attempts at getting their attention to no avail.  Finally, an employee comes out of the bathroom. She approached me and asked me what I wanted. She did not wash her hands in my view so I have no idea what was going on there.  I responded no thank you and left.  To the owners , I'm sure she washed her hands in the bathroom but regardless she should wash again in view of the customers,service 101.  I was really grossed out.  Next visit the barista could not make a proper cappuccino, I won't go into details but I told her this wasn't what I ordered. She offered to remake it but I felt it would be wasteful. As I was leaving I changed my mind because it tasted terrible.  I went back and told her I wanted it remade. She got angry and turned around and walked into the back.  someone else came out and remade the cappuccino but it was still incorrect.  Please Teach your baristas The difference between a cappuccino and a latte.   I will say they have good cookies and a fantastic wine and liquor selection but I will never go there again for coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent flavor to my latte with only half the vanilla pumps.  I ordered a vanilla latte and a cinnamon roll. As with all cinnamon rolls, the flavor improved as I ate towards the center.  My latte had just the right amount of vanilla so I could enjoy the coffee flavor and not feel that my drink was just sweetened milk. It was served in a coffee cup, rather than a to-go cup, which always seems to enhance the flavor.  The breakfast food choices were posted on a large menu above the register. The pastries are placed in front of you to tempt you if you are hungry.  If you come for lunch, you have a good variety of sandwich-type foods to choose from.   This coffee shop has a lot of tables where you can sit and work or hold an afternoon gathering or a quick morning meeting.   Thumbs up to this pleasant local coffee house."}
{"text":"Barriques is a go-to for me as someone who walks from home to school every day during the work week and stops off for a quick Mocha to go most every school day. Speed is of the essence for me and the barista's(who for the most part now know my order in advance) have me in and out in 3-4 minutes which I really appreciate.  The reason I can't give 5 stars come down to the hallmark of any frequent flyer(100+ visits) such as myself, the loyalty/rewards system. Before March 1st of this year Barriques used Belly as their rewards program with the ability to claim your reward on the iPad show it to the barista and be on your way. Now its more complicated. They now use Revel POS as their rewards system. It requires that I tap \"Add Rewards Card\" then enter my phone number on the iPad then its approved by the barista then I select that I want to use a reward, THEN I select which reward I want to redeem. Yes I get that from a business side of things you want POS and Loyalty under one system(Revel) but from a consumer side of things it's a lot of steps to earn and then redeem each \"visit\".  My menu shortlist:  1. Medium Mocha, 2% with whip 2. Medium Baby Grasshopper 3. Mexican Hot Chocolate"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Probably any meal but I've only been here for breakfast.  I had the avocado jack breakfast sandwich and a cafe míel for breakfast and it was fantastic. The avocado jack breakfast wrap had tomatoes, spinach, pepper jack cheese, eggs and of course avocado. You can add bacon for an extra 1.25 which I highly suggest.  My boyfriend had the breakfast sandwich which was also awesome and under $3.  I loved the seating also by the big windows.  Great place to come read and study (a little noisy sometimes) but nice."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Locally owned. Typically stop in for coffee or tea Before work. This week, took my in laws for light breakfast. They've stepped up their service here with speed and better organization. The credit card proceed is still too many steps but smoother than previously. I cannot resist the breakfast sandwich with nueskes bacon. The buns for this have also improved at this location--fresher and lighter. The earl grey tea is devine--enough bergamot but not overdone. Maple nut scones---yum!!  Crumbly yet not dry. I hope they remain in neighborhood."}
{"text":"I like this cafe's cozy interior and tasty food but the occasional roasting sounds can drive you nuts.  Beverages: All the coffeehouse options you would expect, although I think they don't have the superfancy coffeeoptions (Aeropress, Chemex, what have you)  Barriques offers enough food options for you to truly get a meal here--mostly wraps and sandwiches.  Sandwich options are chips, potato salad, or greens.  Salads come with a roll.  Pastries of the scone&cookie variety are also good options. The breakfast egg sandwich is a deal--less than $3 !  The exterior offers  integrated  bike racks into the building and the interior has the famous wall of wine--100 cheap wines! Much of the building remodel used recycled materials.  All the beans for Barriques and a few select restaurants in Madison are roasted at the back of the coffeeshop and there is not significant sound isolation (the dividing walls don't even go all the way up to the ceiling. Roasting occurs five days a week, so there's a good chance you'll hear the noise of the drum roaster.  The noise is really the only significant deterrent against sitting in this coffeeshop for me, but it's significant.  When the drum roaster is at full speed it's VERY loud."}
{"text":"Located right off Park st.....don't blink, you will miss it.  Parking is very scare, so be ready to park down the street.  We parked by the water.  I am not a coffee person, so i was there for the food.  Interesting and cozy atmosphere.   We did sandwiches..they both were great, but a little pricey.  Wife loves their coffees....Everything is fresh.  You can taste it.    Over all, great staff and consumables.  Great atmosphere and free wi-fi."}
{"text":"I had their avocado jack wrap for my hangover cure and all it did was disappoint. Took a good 20 minutes to make and yet still was uninspiring to say the least. There was absolutely no seasoning to the wrap and it was wrapped in a cold tortilla. Coffee was okay."}
{"text":"I loved their intricate coffee types and decor that looked very eco friendly. I wish I had known that this location was so close to the lake earlier on during the summer so I could have enjoyed it but nonetheless I will definitely be grabbing a cup of coffee to go, bundling up and walking along the lake!"}
{"text":"I'm usually a big fan of Barriques, but this location has one problem that is the reason for the two-star rating and why I won't go back. The coffee shop doesn't ventilate properly, so I leave the shop smelling like smoky bacon and have to change my clothes and shower so I can bear myself. I really hope this gets fixed so I can return, but for now I'll go to their other locations."}
{"text":"Great place for a first date when you don't want to spend too much.  It's a great atmosphere that offers both coffee for a brunch date or beer if you're having lunch.  The prices were affordable, with excellent food to top it off.  Maybe the cashier was new, but it took her a while to get our order correct, which is why they are getting 4 stars.    Check them out though, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This was the best coffee experience I've had in a long time. I had a specialty drink; it was obviously made with care. I think it was called a mini grasshopper; it was full of chocolate and mint and was delicious. The internet didn't have a hitch for the two hours I was there, and the parking was a breeze compared to some of the other places I visited in Madison. I'll definitely visit here the next time I need a coffee fix in Madison, whether I have to work or not."}
