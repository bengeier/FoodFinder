{"text":"I took my girlfriend out to dinner on Thursday Night and we were looking for something to do afterwards. We saw some advertisements on facebook so we decided to try out this lounge in uptown and I am so glad we did. It's cool spot to hang out and have a few drinks. They had a live band performing and a Dj afterwards. The staff was nice and our drinks were really good. I finished the night off with a shrimp taco which was the best shrimp taco I have ever had. I will be back everything was awesome."}
{"text":"Great place! The owners Clarence and Rodney are awesome and their staff is too! They always have great DJs playing music especially when DJ PhalseID and DJ Corleone are there! I love going here with a few friends and partying on a Thursday or Friday night."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting over Memorial day weekend & decided to go to a day party that was hosted at this venue. The atmosphere was laid black & cozy. All the girls  were really nice & checked on us to see if we needed anything. The music was rap & wasn't too loud.  We ended up ordering the shrimp basket & it was amazing , I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is great, the music, food, vibration!!!! So refreshing,  I heard a patio has been added can't wait to check it out."}
{"text":"I would've never known this place existed if it wasn't for Herb & Felicia Gray sending out a invitation for the Grand Opening DayParty last month. 
The place is very small and cute, there is a lot of potential here I like the look and feel as if currently is. I may be bias because I attended a Grays event and the crowd for one of their events is 95% my type of crowd which is Grown and Sexy. My review is based on this experience only as I haven't returned since but would like to as the service was great the music was great and the crowd was great. Again it was a Grays event so the crowd was based on the Grown and Sexy, the DJ was a Grays DJ and the staff were aware. If the atmosphere and crowd is the same/similar or better I'll be sure to update my review noting that I returned and had the same impression.
I didn't try food, I only had a Cider on tap which was tasty  .
I'll check back soon to experience this place on a none event day."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! High scale bar & lounge with great drinks, food, music(dj or band) and hookah. Indoor and outdoor seating and bottle service at a reasonable price, especially for the experience. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place has loads of potential. Its pretty close to downtown Charlotte and the layout is really nice. The fire torches at the entrance are a cool touch although not exactly necessary on a really hot night such as the one I attended. The bar area has these cool swings you can sit on and they have a nice outdoor patio that you can smoke hookah on.

We came here to celebrate a friends birthday. She ordered bottles and a section which included two couches. We got a few hookahs for the table. There were two fairly small tables for everything that we had. I think that there should be a designated table for hookah alone .The connectors kept swinging all over the place and knocking down drinks left and right. Not very manageable once the night goes on and people become intoxicated. The liquor being locked up in the case was quite strange to me as an out of Towner but more annoying if the waitress isn't at the table every 5 minutes or so to pour a drink for someone. Waiting on a drink when you have bottle service is definitely a buzz kill. 

The atmosphere was nice it was a mature crowd. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review was he DJ. She just could not read the crowd. She was playing waaaaaay to much \"trap\" music aka new young hip hop for the young folks. Since there wasn't that type of crowd in there I am not sure her motivation for that. Everyone appeared to be 30 and up and would have appreciated a few more throwback. Even after multiple requests she didn't change the music almost as if she had a playlist and couldn't steer from it. I don't know but that ruined the night for some and had us wishing we went to another venue. 

Would I come here again yes because as I said it has potential I just hope they can work out the music."}
{"text":"This place was terrible!!! I'm only giving it one star because I have to. My friend and I sat there for twenty minutes and then decided to get up and get our own drinks. The menu featured top shelf drinks with top shelf prices in and bottom shelf atmosphere. The staff dawned stripper attire with Keds. Keds, though?

In their defense, I was never served a drink or asked if I wanted a hookah. There were no men there so I guess for guys this might work."}
{"text":"This spot was LIT! I'm from Jersey and was in town for a Wedding. A group of us decided to come here on a Friday night. Best decision we could have made. Service was excellent, music was poppin and the hookah & drinks were on point! Small but cozy. Most of the crowd seemed like they're there weekly so they're all cool. One thing they do that I've never seen anywhere else is when you order bottle service, they lock up the bottle. The bottle girl would have to come by and open up the container and make our drinks repeatedly. Wasn't a problem though since she was always checking up on us. The reason they do that is so no one person in the crew hogs the bottle, all get equal amounts. Great night!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went in on comedy night! It was funny. If we couldn't sit down at first and then it took forever to get a drink! The atmosphere was fun and I like the music and so did my husband !"}
{"text":"Cool vibe. Good DJ, drinks, and hookah. Very low key hangout spot. Only hesitation is it is kinda small. Can't wait to try the food here. They have happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"I fell I love with Fire House Bar & Lounge in Charolette. When my sister and friends suggested hookah, I didn't know what to expect. But..... It was such a dope spot. Great atmosphere. And the highlight...... the bar had swings. Best night ever. Of course we munched on wings and fries. Which were delish. And my sister had the shrimp tacos! People were great. The music was great. I loved the vibe of the whole place. I shall return!!!"}
{"text":"Rodney, who is part owner is extremely rude to the customers. I have witnessed first hand how he belittles the staff and customers. He is racist and forgets that the people he talks down too are paying his bills."}
{"text":"I was here for an event a friend of mine was hosting to celebrate the 5 year anniversary of her business. There was also a day party being hosted at the same time. I like the fact that the had a separate event space from the main bar area.

Our servers were attentive and kept the drinks flowing. I spent most of my time in the event space but the main bar area had a really nice ambiance and there are even swings at the bar. I'm from Miami and heard the owner is as well. He definitely did a great job trying to bring that sexy Miami feel to Charlotte. 

I'm excited to come back hang out have a drink from the bar instead of bottle service. Also want to come chill and have a hookah. Also excited to try one of these shrimp tacos I keep hearing about. Really nice chill lounge."}
{"text":"I said I wouldn't come back...I lied. 

I came back per friends request, and it was excellent. It's safe to say they had a good talk about their customer service, because the waitresses were very attentive. We tipped our waitress double time because of how good she was. Going above and beyond really makes a difference!"}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting Firehouse Bar & Lounge. I appreciate the laid back atmosphere compared to all the madness uptown. 

Food: 
The menus is small, everything is freshly made. The Shrimp tacos are a hit! This dish comes with a side of fries. The tacos are topped with a house sauce and pineapple salsa! Best Tacos in Charlotte!!! Hands down! I almost ordered a ToGo plate. 

Parking:
Somewhat limited. There's a small area beside the building along with others street parking.

So apparently Firehouse opened five weeks ago. Seems to be going well. I look forward to the growth and success of this business. I can't wait to try the Fried Lobster and shrimp!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to just get away!!! The staff was nice and the food was great! Besides the constant doors opening bringing in the flies the atmosphere, hookah, and bartenders were amazing! They always have events going on and this is great place to catch up with friends without spending a fortune!"}
{"text":"This place was really interesting! I loved the swings in the place ! The music was great and it was pretty chill. They had many hookah flavors and the servers were on point. They do have sit down areas but there is an open floor so I'm sure it becomes packed on the weekends. I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go with a group of friends to grab a drink and to hookah. Pretty chill place."}
{"text":"Great time ! Dj was excellent and service was outstanding! One of the best spot I have been too in Charlotte.."}
{"text":"A couple friends and myself came here one night just to relax. the menu can seem a little pricey but the wait staff are great with telling what's really worth it and what's not. The drinks were really good and so was the music. I like the ambiance. The place is super big but everyone was ok with the space we did have. I love the swings at the bar."}
{"text":"Good chill spot for a drink and hookah. Somewhat small and I didn't try the food which it seems is served out of a firetruck which is pretty cool. I went on a Saturday night and they had a DJ playing current hip hop. They had swings at the bar which was fun and somewhat interesting (warning don't hurt yourself). Definitely more of your second course for the night not your main attraction in terms of hangout spots.  Age group 30 and up."}
{"text":"Great food, great hookahs, very easy to find only issue is the music is really loud. Don't go here on a first date."}
{"text":"Had a blast here at this spot. We went for the Saturday day party, and this had to be the most hype place to be in Charlotte. The Dj was great and played nothing but hot music the entire time. The hookah was very strong and the drinks were good. The female bartenders were friendly and all very attractive. Being here reminded me of being at a day party in my city Atlanta. The only thing I could barely complain about was the fact that it was sweltering hot in this place. I was actually surprised at how hot it was in there. In the summer, you absolutely HAVE to have some type of air circulating in your establishment if you want people to stay there a long time. We actually decided to leave early b/c of the heat. 

But we had an amazing time here. Everyone was super friendly, even to us out of towners that didn't know anyone there. This is definitely a spot that I will hit each time I go to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Omg I love love love Firehouse Bar & Grill. If you want to listen to good music, smoke hookah, and enjoy strong drinks....def make your way here! A group of us, like 7, all met up at Firehouse and had a blast.  All the guys were able to find a spot at the bar while the girls were able to snag their famous swinging chairs ... so cute! Lol. I want a swing in my room now; it was so adorable! It's a small place but we were all able to have space and enjoy ourselves while here. The music selection was great, perfect volume (so you can still have a convo), and the DJ mixed well. We also ended up grabbing food here too, I got the shrimp tacos with fries, & surprisingly it was pretty good! The furniture and décor is beautiful, as well! Ambiance is key! Just overall a good experience. Not much else to say but if you want a good night out with your friends, definitely come here! You won't be disappointed!

Favs: Everything!

Would Change: Not.A.Thing :D"}
