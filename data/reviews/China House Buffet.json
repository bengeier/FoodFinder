{"text":"Did not enjoy.  Limited selection and it wasn't that good.  I too was hoping for the mexican / chinese buffet and missed the boat.  If it was cheaper I might add it my rotation but there are other places in the area that are much better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food. I go often for take out. It is easy and convenient for those in central phoenix. I have had times where some of the food is great and other times it was bad. Support local restaurants, this beats panda express!"}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't exist anymore. It was replaced by another Chinese restaurant and there is no buffet (all-you-can-eat) option."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to try a Mexican /  Chinese buffet but it looks like we were too late to the party.   Enter the door and you will be inside a dimly lit place with booth and a 2nd room with some large tables.  There a few a few buffet rows and another along the wall with condiments and deserts.  From a veg point of view this place is ok. There was a bean sprout heavy vegetable mix, a mushrooms and peppers dish, and veggie noodles that had a unearthly color, egg fu yong and rice.    As expected everything was greasy but decent, the mushroom dish could have used a bit more cooking.  I was glad to see the chilli oil with lots of chilli in it on the condiment line.  For you meat eaters theres a large array of meat items and even some craw fish and shrimp ones.  With out or tip it was about $7 which was not a great deal for a place as sketchy as this.  If you are near by and must have AYCE Chinese then maybe stop in."}
