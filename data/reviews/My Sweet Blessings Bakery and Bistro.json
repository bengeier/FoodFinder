{"text":"I am not usually a fan of burritos, but wow I am obsessed with their breakfast burrito and all of their pastries are fantastic. I've definitely found my favorite place to grab breakfast or lunch or just a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had lunch here for the first time.  Everything is fresh and made from scratch.  Amazing food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with the whole family...  Coffee is amazing, pastries are all fresh and delicious, and of all the breakfast items we ordered I couldn't pick a favorite because they were all so good!  The staff also couldn't be nicer.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good food, but I've made 3 trips here when they've said they were open, & they were closed. They even have signs on the road at times when they are closed. If they posted current business hours I would give them 5/5, but I've wasted a lot of time due to this, hence the 2/5"}
{"text":"Our lunch here was truly embarrassing.  I ordered the Italian grinder and my wife ordered the turkey sage sandwich.  I had a \"fresh squeezed\" lemonade.  Each sandwich was roughly $13 and the lemonade was $3.  When we were served, we both got a tiny sandwich and a few chips.  When we looked at the sandwiches, both were missing ingredients listed on the menu.  In my case, it was capicola and pepperoncini and in my wife's case, it was bacon.  Plus, whatever was in the lemonade, the first or second ingredient wasn't lemon.  Sugar and some kind of fruit flavor.  To say we were unhappy is an understatement.  To pay $38 and get two truly crappy sandwiches defies description.  We can't believe that a restaurant can survive being that indifferent to their customers.  This place is awful."}
{"text":"Best lemon bars EVER. The bakery recently made cupcakes for my daughters birthday and they were a hit: moist and light with sweet and fluffy frosting. Everyone at the party was asking about them. One of my current local faves!"}
{"text":"Baked goodies are the best! Salads, Sammies, Soups yumm! Grab a quick delicious meal you won't be disappointed. MSBB  works overtime to please. Just a little trickey to find."}
{"text":"I have heard that Sweet Blessings has reopened for business on 60th Street near the Desert Foothills YMCA and Paradise Valley Community College. I am looking forward to trying out the new location. My prior one star was based on the disappointment that they were out of business and closed at their prior location and not based on prior experience, therefore, I will rate my prior experience as four stars and provide update when we visit the new location after we return from our summer home in October."}
{"text":"I would like to take a moment to say farewell to all of the other breakfast burritos in AZ. We had some good times and I will treasure the memories, but I've found a new love. Her name is My Sweet Blessing's Classic Breakfast Burrito.    They have amazing baked goods. The employees were extremely friendly, and the service was very prompt. We just found our new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"We ordered sandwiches, salad, and chips for 9 for a business retreat. The food arrived on time, just as we had ordered. We had the toasted cheese and chicken salad sandwich with kale salad. everything tasted really fresh and delicious. One of our students is still talking about the kale salad and how wonderful it was. We would definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"This family-owned and operated cafe is a local gem! We had a delicious breakfast of quiche and an omelette (which wasn't on the menu but in hearing one of us doesn't eat bread products, Theresa generously offered to make him one. Great customer service!). I couldn't resist taking home a cinnamon roll muffin and it was mind-blowingly good). Highly recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Family owned and operated.  Everyone is very nice.  The pastries are home made each day.  I love the sandwiches and salad especially.  I am there a few times a week. Love it."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was here but I'm so happy I ventured out and found it!Breakfast burrito I shared was awesome. And don't forget dessert! Everything made on site daily. I will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This place in one word is Amazing. Absolutely amazing food! Everything is scratch made fresh every morning and family owned and operated! So delicious. Hands down best pastries I've ever had and their sandwiches and salads are just as delicious! Everything is HUGE! My favorite place...there is no competition... Sweetest staff, best food!"}

{"text":"This place is delicious!  The turkey Brie sandwich is amazing!  Very friendly service every time we stop in. Will be back here a lot!"}
{"text":"Great place for sweets, breakfast, and lunch. I love the poblano and roasted corn breakfast Brito. Croissants are tremendously awesome as well. We will be getting our Thanksgiving pies here this year. They are open during the week and on Saturday from I think 8 to 2 or so."}
{"text":"I sought out a bakery for our gender reveal and Teresa was so nice and accommodating. She was easy to get in touch with by phone and email going over details of the cake and even was accommodating when I changed some details around. The end result was a beautiful cake and a dozen cupcakes that were not only beautiful to look at, but super delicious inside! Thank you Teresa for making our gender reveal so memorable!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food from this place. Best bagel sandwich I've ever had and the burritos are amazing too! Wish they had more locations"}

{"text":"Amazing breakfast sandwich all freshly made ingredients. The ham egg and cheese croissant was the best I have tasted. The staff was very pleasant"}
{"text":"I have found my new favorite place. And based on my reviews you know that is not easy for me! An adorable little caf√© nestled in the beautiful Cave Creek area on 60th St. and Carefree highway. Conveniently located right next to where I work out at the gorgeous Desert foothills ymca. Once inside you will think you are in Paris in a quaint little charming bistro. The sous chef who is part of the family who owns it took my order. I got the special of the day fresh made quiche with a mixed green salad, balsamic vinaigrette. The dressing was a perfect mix of sweet & tangy & was not too heavy just the right amount delicately sprinkled. The lettuce was crisp & fresh. The quiche crust seems to have a multi grain base which is great since I just got done with my workout and don't want to completely destroy it! The quiche egg was fluffy and cooked it the way it should be not underdone not overdone. Freshly grated Parmesan (not from a tin or even a package from a bar of real Parmesan ) complemented the top of the quiche and salad. And now for my favorite part which you might find a bit silly. I have yet to be Phoenix restaurant that serves freshly squeezed lemonade. In another review I criticize a very high-end Italian restaurant for serving my kids what was clearly Country Time lemonade. I mean I am even OK with serving the Simply Lemonade brand from Fry's. But nope this place is the real deal they squeeze their own lemons and add just the right amount of REAL sugar not sweet and low or whatever but it's very mild and it's just the right amount, served with finely crushed ice. So basically I just had one of the best meals I've had in probably a year. The rest of Phoenix you could learn a thing or two from this darling little bistro that is a foodie's paradise and I haven't even had one of their signature dessert bars yet, but I will...."}
{"text":"We ordered a luau themed birthday cake and cookies for our daughter's party. Everything was gorgeous and the pina colada flavored cake was extremely moist and delicious.  I am so happy I found this bakery for future celebrations!"}
{"text":"A unique and casual place where the food is excellent.  Fresh and homemade.  A big plus for me was the attitude of all who work in this sweet, small cafe.  Where do you get good food and happy workers? THIS CAFE!!!"}
{"text":"The grilled cheese here  I work across the st from here the office frequently orders from here for sure recommend the grilled cheese!!! Iv also had the tuna sandwich great sandwich as well!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here often.  The food is fresh and the pastries are heaven. If you can talk Teresa into making you a pie you will be in heaven!"}
{"text":"Everything homemade, from scratch. Great cheddar biscuit and Kona coffee, sweet little cafe"}
{"text":"Friendly service, but just had coffee and pastry. Wasn't impressed and it's a little outta the way to find it.  My complaint is mostly a street sign on the highway and then you had to work to find it . Someday I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of having breakfast here this week. The service is excellent and so friendly. The kona mon coffee is delicious. Had a difficult time deciding but went with the quiche that came with a fresh green salad with balsamic dressing. The quiche is the best I have had in my life! Not to be missed. Looking forward to ordering quiches and pies to share with my friends and family for the holidays."}
{"text":"Came in after 12pm with my big bunch! 7 of us and we were looking for breakfast. Asked the gal if we could do breakfast and she said yes we would love too. Food & service was amazing! Pastries and coffee are amazing. Great place for an afternoon pick me up or breakfast & lunch. Thanks for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"We went in the early afternoon and there wasn't much left. :( the cookies we got were very tasty though. It is located on the campus, so don't be discouraged. Was hoping for more options, maybe earlier in the morning."}
{"text":"Do not miss this little gem on the desert. Tucked away near the Desert Foothills Theater and YMCA, the food is spectacular and more than a soup or sandwich. Think five star restaurant in a little bistro. Breakfast and lunch service. Unique and quality ingredients, friendly staff and cute, casual location"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place for breakfast on our way to Cave Creek. It is attached to a cute community center with plenty of seating. The staff was so welcoming and friendly- a really friendly, small town feel. We ordered an orange and chocolate scone, the sausage and cheese quiche, and the southwestern breakfast burrito. Everything was delicious. Homemade, fresh, perfect! One of the best breakfasts we've had since being in Arizona! Stop by this place to fuel up for your hike"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast and lunch. It's family owned and because they are such great people they are quickly becoming my extended family ! For breakfast I consistently get the burritos (classic is my favorite but wife's favorite is the southwest), quesadilla, and quiche.. All are do die for. For lunch the BFLT, turkey Brie, croissant, and bagel sandwiches are all awesome ! Love their vanilla coffee too. Only had their sweets a few times, but they were dynamite. Dangerous stuff watch out don't get addicted !"}
{"text":"What a terrific addition to the area. Real scones. Beautiful pastries. Great soup. The chef made me olive rosemary loaves special order. Just fantastic."}
