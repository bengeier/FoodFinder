{"text":"Looking for a place to hang with friends? This is the place.  Looking to grab a beer and watch the scenery alone? This is the place.  Looking to grab something to eat? This is the place.  No matter what time my friends and I stop by, the bartenders are friendly and the food is good.  We have eaten everything from the appetizers, to the delicious cheese tortellini (that could rival many of the high priced strip restaurants)."}
{"text":"Locals love Hat Rod Grille.  The food is very good--wonderful breakfasts, sandwiches and a pretty extensive menu.   The atmosphere is very trendy--really neat car memorabilia, actual cars  and TVs everywhere.  The help is most friendly.  It's a nice place to bring the family.  There's a fun upstairs also.  Downstairs has a room that groups use. It's quite private.  I've had lots of events there and we ordered off the menu.  Everyone was very satisfied.  Hot Rod Grille is a clean, fun, comfortable place to eat."}
{"text":"Average everyday bar, with a ton of car parts and pictures around. The staff was friendly, and they have a cool little game room area upstairs with couches and bar games. The food I had was your typical bar food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day because my car broke down and I had to get it fixed at the car shop next door!

The place is crowded with race car/motorcycle memorabilias! Their burgers were good...the fries were good...kinda typical bar and grill place...like Dennys...maybe better but not as great as Chilis!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time here. Another food trip inspired by a restaurant.com $25 gift certificate.

We arrived at 7pm Friday night and the parking lot was fairly full but once we entered the dining room was empty-everyone was in the bar.

We asked to sit upstairs in the game room and it was empty to. We had it all to ourselves....or so we thought.

They have 2 pool tables,fooseball,pinball, racing,hunting and a jukebox plus a big screen with 3 couches to lounge and a 100\"+ projection screen for events,etc.

There's also a small bar upstairs but the waitresses do have to run up & down the stairs for soft drinks & food.

We ordered drinks & some cheeseburger sliders for an appetizer. Then we all ordered sandwiches and a steak.

My son got the Teriyaki Swiss burger with fries, my wife got the Turkey Bacon Club and I got the  Mustang Melt-an 8oz New York with bleu cheese and bacon bits.

Before the food arrived a group of 10-12 kids and their parents arrived to add some life to the place. The kids were all well-behaved and excitedly enjoying all the games.

The service was great, the food however was just ok. The hamburger taste like frozen patties flavorless & dry -not at all good. The turkey club was great and the steak was enjoyable but the bleu cheese & bacon wasn't necessary the steak would have been better without it.

I was a little disappointed they didn't have the california-style  tuna melt that used to be on the menu (http://www.menusearch.net/lasvegas/restaurant.php?name=570)

I will buy another GC @ restaurant.com but I will stay away from the burgers and stick to the pork tenderloin."}
{"text":"+1 for the restaurant.com-inspired visit, same as prior reviewer.

We took some friends here for a bite to eat.  The dinner salads were nothing to order again, but the rueben was quite good.  You have to know what to order at a place like this.  You can't ask too much, because it's basically a bar that also has a restaurant attached.  

It's weird inside - lots of car parts & all patrons are in the glassed-off bar portion.  You will be the only party eating.  On the upside, even a very limited waitperson can take care of 1 table quite competently.

I have nothing bad to say about this place, but the 4-star rating takes the discounted price into consideration."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I've never sat in the restaurant section of this place.  However, I can attest to the view from the inside of the bar!  Hot Rods has quickly become my favorite place to go after work with collegues and friends alike to de-stress from the day and get a little blitz'd.  Happy Hour from 4 to 7pm makes for a good time.  Finger foods half off, cheap beer and discounted shots are all on the menu.

The bartenders are pretty good eye candy for men and women alike.  They're friendly, will make you some wild-ass shots and are attentive.

Word of warning to the non-smokers out there...if you can't hang with the smell, stay out of the bar.  I smoke off and on, and it doesn't bother me, but it seems like there isn't a soul in the bar that doesn't smoke, so prepare to walk into the cloud and leave smelling like a Marlboro factory reject.

Best part about this place?!?!?  IT'S A CHARGER BAR!!!!  woo hoo!  I'm in love."}
