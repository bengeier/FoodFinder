{"text":"I gotta say, I had my doubts when first coming here. I simply though this would be your average sandwich shop and would be just a clone of Panera. In retrospect, I was wrong.   The reason to come to Loafers is the bread. The bread is what will keep you coming back. Their is so many different grains and flavors used in their bread, plus they change occasionally. Their is also a decent range of side dishes from potato salad to soup. The sandwiches are fresh and full of flavor, so your tastebuds will be satisfied. But this is only for lunch and dinner.    For breakfast, I have mixed emotions. They have divine muffins and coffee cake. Believe me, they have at least one sweet treat that you will get addicted to. But as for sandwiches, they only have one type. As for me, I love variety. So only having one type of breakfast sandwich is a real letdown. Couldn't they make it like McDonald's and use English Muffins or Croissants and not just bread? I don't know, maybe it is just me,  but they lost some points for that.   One last thing, you could also buy straight-up loaves of bread. I can't praise the bread enough. All in all, Loafers is perfect for those  for want something sweet for breakfast and fine quality bread for a sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to come for a heathy fresh meal! This is the perfect place to go whether your meeting friends for lunch or eating alone! It's a casual relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere. Genuinely happy and helpful staff. Family owned farm/business. Fresh flour daily. Great selections of freshly made breads and other baked goods. Challah, Laurel Mountain Herb and Cinnamon raisin walnut were a few of the choices during my visit. I can't imagine you'd visit on a day where a delicious variety was not available. The sandwiches were perfect and made to order. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great family owned business. I love that they mill their own wheat; it's evident in the quality of their breads. It's a nice place to grab lunch all while knowing that the ingredients are fresh and local!"}
{"text":"My first time here, really good roast beef sandwich, but they need to take care of the fly problem in the dining room, it's gross. I will be back though, But I think I'll sit outside & eat."}
{"text":"It's so cool that this place mills its own flour!  Cooking and baking is such a lost art sometimes and I was glad to hear that they do this."}
{"text":"Fresh deli sandwiches on homemade bread and delicious soup!  Will be back."}
{"text":"This place has some really unique breads and the selections change daily. They also have samples of some of there breads available. I got the Laurel Mountain herb. Yummy!  Other examples include German Stout available on Mondays, Montana Multi-Grain on Tuesday, cherry apple on Wednesday, Blueberry pineapple on Thursday, English muffin on Friday, and Sunflower Whole wheat on Saturday.  They also have other items like lemon blueberry pound cake and banana bread.  If you are familiar with the great harvest bread company it is very similar. It is nothing like Panera  They offer only round unsliced loaves the way bread was sold until the early 1900s. Because there are no artificial preservatives, a sliced loaf would go stale too fast. Nutritional information is available for all the bread  They offer free delivery for 7 or more box lunches"}
{"text":"I always walk in for a sandwich and walk out with a loaf of bread and cookies.  Everything is always made fresh.  The bread really makes the sandwiches.  They even serve basic PB&J!  They have homemade granola.  The lemon blueberry loaf is excellent.  I like the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and the cinnamon rolls.  Who am I kidding?  I like everything they serve!"}
{"text":"Being a bread lover this place is a paradise for me! A nice variety of bread types to choose from and all look and (in fact) taste amazing.  The challah bread is my absolute favorite and close enough is the cinnamon bread.  You should also totally try the cinnamon sugar covered nuts! In some sense I am glad I live 30 minutes from Loafers because otherwise I would eat on loaf of bread every day!   Their lunch sandwiches also seems great and I will definitely have to try them next time!"}
{"text":"The MOST awesome Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies not baked by my Grandmother! Food is definitely homemade.  Unique and definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Same idea as Panera, but with a smaller and more local feel. I can recommend the garden veggie sandwich. Reasonably priced sandwiches, salads, soups, breads, and muffins. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Everything is baked at this site and some bread goes out to the Cranberry and Fox Chapel locations.  They use natural ingredients and Artisan baking methods.  They have a dining room that is a little like Panera, but with better food.  The staff was very friendly.  If you are buying bread, get there a little earlier, as they sometimes sell out of inventory.  Everything is made fresh, so I can completely understand."}
{"text":"Yum!! What a great option for lunch?! I usually do Panera or Zuppas but, today,I wanted to try something new. They have a ton of bread (duh!), sandwiches and salads. I had the pick two combo... you get half of a sandwich and a cup of soup or small salad for $6.59. That's really affordable for delicious food! The ladies here were super friendly and got my food put together within 2 minutes. There are enough eating for 50 people, about 10 outside and 40 inside. Today, I got the turkey/bacon club and a cup of chicken gumbo. The gumbo was not spicy at all but very flavorable. The club was pretty good - turkey was thinly sliced and toppings were high quality. I, also, got the lemon blueberry pound cake for the team and that was really good (especially when paired with coffee). I'll have to add this joint to my weekly lunch routine!"}
{"text":"I usually stop at this location every Tuesday for lunch between jobs.   It's convenient to the Wexford and mccandless area. The business is local and known for their amazing bread.  They serve soup, salads and sandwiches at a reasonable cost.  The staff is always friendly.  There is plenty of seating for the lunch time crew.  They could be a little more diligent in cleaning up tables after customers leave but otherwise a great place to stop for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Tried Loafers for the first time last night. I have some good news and some bad news. Let's get the bad out of the way. We stopped in around 5:45 PM and interrupted someone mopping up the floors. They close at 7 PM. I'm all for getting your closing work done early, but over an hour early seems like a bit much. Not only that, the same worker went on to make one of our sandwiches, which felt a little gross.   That being said, I have no complaints about the food. My sandwich was delicious. They don't have many pre-designed options, so it took a while for me to order, but it was great. My husband and I had soup as well, and it tasted homemade...certainly not microwaved or frozen like at other restaurants. The staff was friendly and helpful.   I don't know that we'll go out of our way to go back, but if we're passing by we definitely might drop in again."}
{"text":"Amazing how great bread can make a sandwich excellent! Wonderful service & really reasonable prices when we had lunch there today. Ended up purchasing a challah and a cinnamon swirl loaf to go & I'm not sure we'll have any left by tomorrow.  We were visiting from out of town but will definitely stop here on our next visit."}
{"text":"Loafers has the very best bread I have ever had anywhere!!!  It is unheard of to find so many breads in one place that are made without preservatives, gmo's, and processed sugars.  Clearly they are doing something right, what with 3 locations.  As all natural foods are touted more and more as the key to healthy and longer lives, I see places like Loafers that offer the same types of products we are used to eating but in a healthier way going far.  I would love to see them expand... Philly and New York next please!"}
{"text":"I walked in at 10:45, and despite the sign that said they had breakfast sandwiches, I couldn't get one because it was after 10:30. (The restaurant was empty and making an egg takes 5 minutes.) After they said no to that, I asked if they would make a Caesar salad wrap or sandwich, and again, no. I got the veggie sandwich, which was quite good. They also didn't have honey for tea. The sandwich shop side of the business seems not accommodating and poorly equipped."}
{"text":"Drove out to Wexford today with my father, specifically to go to Loafers.  We'd tried their cinnamon swirl bread at a farmer's market locally and hoped the hour drive to pickup another loaf would be worth it.  #spoileralert...SO WORTH IT!!!  The restaurant was so clean, the small staff was incredibly inviting.  There were only three women working behind the counter but they were efficient and helpful with yummy recommendations.  They greeted many customers by name and you get a real sense of community and pride while inside Loafers.  I had half a turkey sandwich with pesto mayo, lettuce and bacon on it.  I elected to have the combo and added a cup of cheesy cauliflower soup.  Both were amazing.  The soup was rich, cheesy as promised and alone worth the hour drive.  Dad had pulled pork and chips and loved every bite.  We left with a loaf of the previously mentioned scrumptious cinnamon swirl bread and an unanticipated chai spiced pound cake.  (I'd tried a sample of the pound cake and it is EPIC)  However long it takes you to get to Loafers...do it.  Make the trip, eat something whilst you're there and continue supporting such underrated local gems!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Super fresh sandwiches and salads. The bread and pies are amazing. A smaller menu then panera but a gazillion times better with taste and quality."}
{"text":"We have been in the area a few times in the last couple weeks and have stopped into Loafers every time we were.   Not only is everything delicious, but the employees are so friendly.   We have use the PA Dutch loaf to make grilled stickies, we have had the rosemary olive bread which was so good with pasta, the tomato basil which was equally good with pasta, the sunflower bread made amazing sandwiches, the cheddar loaf was eaten plain by the chunk (tasted like pepperoni bread with the pepperoni), dozens of cookies and cinnamon rolls and even had their scones.   You literally can't go wrong. Everything is absolutely delicious. The place is super clean and the service is awesome.   I have a feeling we will be coming back just for the bread even when we are not in the area..."}
{"text":"So glad to stumble upon this bakery! Delicious bread! I was also delighted to learn that they mill their own flour too! I will be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"Yummy bread and made to order sandwiches. Busy but the line keeps moving. Like their cookies and all of their salads too (potato salad is delicious). They have a punch card. Buy so many loaves and get one free. :) awesome perk!"}
{"text":"Not as good as they used to be. The employees are just not as quick or on top of it anymore."}
{"text":"Loafers is a locally owned bakery/cafe.  Their loaves of bread are made fresh daily.  I haven't had a bad sandwich at this place, but my fave is their meatball sandwich.  I think unlike before, they are only sold on certain days (mon and sat?).  I usually check their twitter to see the daily sandwich and soup menu.  I've only had their chicken cesar salad but my husband recommends the chef's salad w/ chicken.  I trust him as he has lunch at Loafers almost everyday.  The portions are big and definitely filling.  They have a half and half option where you can get half a sandwich with soup or salad.    My other faves at loafers are their challah bread and pumpkin choc chip bread.  They also sell natrona bottled sodas. Workers are usually friendly.  A little disappointed that the workers don't ask for your loafers dozen club card or offer it.  Dave is the only one who seems to remember and he's really nice."}
