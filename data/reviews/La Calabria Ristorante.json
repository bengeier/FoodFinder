{"text":"I'm not sure if these people that rated this place poorly were just having a bad day or what, but I had a hot chicken parmigiana ciabatta and it was amazing! Everything is homemade and their slogan is \"Even the chef is imported\". which is very clever! My water was refilled even if it didn't really need to be and I was able to meet the chef and his wife! I had a very pleasant time! 6 bucks for a homemade lunch? Yes, please!! I will definitely be back often!"}
{"text":"I recently went to La Calabria and the food was fabulous. I was watching Channel 3 News and saw a feature about them so I decided to try it out. The atmosphere makes you feel you are in Italy. Right away we were greeted by Clara, one of the owners. She was very friendly. Her husband is from Calabria and makes all the food. I had the Butternut Squash, which is their special of the month, and it was delicious! All of the food is homemade including the desserts. I highly reccomend La Calabria!!"}
{"text":"I'm am giving 3 stars for a combination of things. The food I would probably give a 4 and the service a 2. We had two pasta dishes both were very good. I asked to see the dessert menu before our dinner came out and our server said, \"we usually bring that out after your meal\" I said ok. After the meal she brought the dessert menu and I was full at this point. Then she said \"well you said you wanted dessert earlier\", almost mad I didn't want anything. I will probably give this place another chance and hope I get a different server."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! Had the cheese ravioli and it was flavorful. Husband had the lasagna and it was amazing too. Bring you're appetite portions are a good size. The owner was our waitress and she is a wonderful woman! This a must try place for Italian food. I loved the bread with their Italian Olive oil dipping concoction, absolutely amazing! You must try this place!"}
{"text":"We went here as a group of six and sat right down at 420pm on fathers day. The place is well hidden but easy to find. I picked this place because the yelp reviews were 4-5's. We were definitely pleased with the choice, it is the best Italian food we have ever had. The black linguini with seafood was awesome, lasagna was great, veal was some off the best, and the kids were very happy with theirs. The wait staff was great fast and attentive. There was 3-4 helping at every table, granted it's a small place but it got busy after we got there. Never had to find the waiter or waitress they were there ready to help when we thought of something we needed. This will become a regular place for us, though a little pricy. Four adults and two kids for $110 and we only had entrees and 3 soft drinks. But it's that good! Thanks yelp reviewer's never would have found this place otherwise."}
{"text":"I love this place... the food is always great! You can never go wrong with the specials.  The pastas and the sauces are so good. As others have stated the ambiance is a little lack luster.... but when a beautiful plate comes to the table.... who is looking at the walls? !   I had my head buried in a plate of stuffed artichokes 12/31/17  Yummy!  Love to support family owned places.  Glad you are back."}
{"text":"A great app. And glass of wine to top off a beautiful day here in Az! Salmon with asparagus drizzled with a pesto sauce. The asparagus was cooked to perfection. This is my favorite dinner or drink and light bite at the bar place.  You can never go wrong with the specials and Clara, Giovanni and staff always make you feel welcome and at home. I love to see the support this local mom & pop place is getting from the neighborhood. **** I would recommend reservations on the weekends.  There is something on the menu sure to please everyone in your party."}
{"text":"Havent been there in awhile...I remember it wasn't as good as the initial visits."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat out! Great food and friendly owner. Family-friendly place that offers good food (parents know how rare that is!). It is sad that they are closing at their current location, but looking forward to visiting them at their new location."}
{"text":"This is such a truly nice place with very nice people.  Started with a cup of coffee.  Asked if the coffee was good, and the server offered to make fresh.  It was truly delicious, not bitter, just delicious and fresh.  Italian bread with olive oil (sweet, mellow, delicious olive oil) with added herbs and sun dried tomatoes and garlic.  Could make a meal of this if not careful.  Ordered the Sea Bass as an entree and asked to substitute soup for the salad.  The soup was the most delicious have had in a long while. Good to the last drop.  Obviously home made with care.  The sea bass was also delicious, cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly.  Served on a bed of delicious pasta and skillfully sprinkled with cheese by one of the young servers.  The servers are very attentive while not obtrusive.  There are some young people who keep an eye out to see if there is anything anyone needs.  These young people add a very refreshing touch.  Ended with homemade cheesecake.  Melts in the mounth.    the best ever.  All in all a wonderful meal.   This will be my favorite place. Can't wait to bring my family here."}
{"text":"Memorandum  Date: August 27 2013  To: People Interested in Fine Dining  From: Zac R.  Subject: La Calabria Ristorante    Here is a little background on La Calabria Ristorante. Before arriving to the restaurant, I did some research online, and figured out that this place is family and locally owned in Gilbert. The owner Giovanni is originally from Calabria, Italy, and he moved to the United States in his thirties. Since the owner is from Italy, I made the assumption that this place would be quite authentic and delicious.   When I entered the restaurant I realized it was fine dining. The place was decorated as if it was a part of Italy, having numerous maps of Italy all over the restaurant and bottles of wine everywhere. Having traveled to Italy, the atmosphere was extremely reminiscent of being in Italy. The servers make you feel like part of the family, almost as if they knew you previously. There is a faint sound of Italian music in the background such as the great Andrea Bocelli. Before ordering or receiving any food, this restaurant deserves an A for service and atmosphere.  The menu has a wide variety of authentic Italian food dishes ranging from seafood to veil. I ordered the Linguine Rusticana which was a seafood dish composed of shrimp and linguine noodles in a white wine sauce with mushrooms and spinach. The shrimp was cooked to perfection, and practically melted in your mouth with every chew. Overall, this restaurant is a full cultural experience into the Italian cuisine and deserves every person to dine at."}
{"text":"This was Valentine's Day 2015.  I am a New Yorker who is on a constant search for good Italian food. La Calabria isn't a place for atmosphere. BUT the food and service makes you forget about it. All their pasta is homemade. The four of us loved our meals. You gotta have their homemade cheesecake. Second only to Capri's when it was still open on Coney Island Ave and Ave M in Brooklyn. They lost a star for charging $3 to add pasta to your meal. It ain't Italian without it. If there is four of you, order the rigatoni  ala vodka sauce for $16 and share it. Its worth it. We drove 55 miles to get there, and it was worth it."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent! Great service and friendly staff. Great authentic Italian food, I will definitely be back.  We stared with the antipasto with imported cheese and meats. I had the cantiloni which was amazing!"}
{"text":"In an unassuming strip mall is the most fantastic Italian restaurant.  I have been many times and it is always excellent.  This is true Italian food and the food and service is always great.  You feel like you're in Italy.  Don't forget the desserts!!"}
{"text":"The place was awesome! All the food was right on point. We ordered appetizers, and dinner, each meal was perfectly spaced out. Even the side salad was delicious. You can really see how much the owners are involved and care about their business! Way better than a boring chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Fresh authentic Italian food at a good price and excellent service."}
{"text":"Love having La Calabria back in action.  Great food, great service, great people!  We have yet to find anything on the menu we haven't enjoyed.  Most recently it was the lobster ravioli, cheese and meat tortellini and veal.  We need to head back soon and try the pizza that's been added to the menu.  Keep room for the Tiramisu!"}
{"text":"I hardly ever give 5 stars. This is well beyond deserved. Some of the best Southern Italian  food I have ever had. In Italy, SF, Chicago, London, or New York. Sure it's located inside a strip mall some of the best restaurants I've had the pleasure dining at have been. It's Mom And Pop and I appreciate that.  Service: excellent. Very welcoming, informed, and they are kid friendly.  Food: we had the calamari and Burrata caprese to start. Both were superb. The Burrata was house made with fresh tomatoes, basil, arugula. Yum!  Meatballs: my son had his first meatball loved it. The marinara was perfect. Bright not too sweet.  Chicken Marsala: best Marsala I've ever had.  Fettuccine La Calabria: house made pasta. Cooked perfectly. Shrimp, peas, . prosciutto tomatoes, mushrooms white wine and garlic! OMG. I'll dream about this!  Desserts: some are made in house and some are not. We got the chocolate cannoli in the cheesecake both made in house. Both Fantastic. We will be back."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Except I am so excited they have reopened. We went here for my birthday dinner and I was looking forward to having their Gnocchi. It wasn't on the menu.The chef heard it was my birthday and made me an order in a to die for spicy cream sauce. I could have licked the plate. The Calamari was excellent. And the piece of Tiramisu they brought, one of the best I have had.  Our waitress, Nektaria(?) was so sweet and attentive.  We will definitely be going back again. And if they Gnocchi isn't in the menu yet I will shed a small tear but that just means I get to try something else."}
{"text":"The food was good, but it wasn't anything to write home about. Some of the food was very yummy and some of it was rather bland. I could come back, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"the internet reviews rated this restaurant 5 stars, so we decided to try it out.  we weren't disappointed.  our meal was chicken w/tomatoe & artichoke in a great sauce, cabbage&carrots was  amazing..and potatoes...i don't know what seasoning they used on it all...but we so enjoyed it...and then dessert went w/ and ooh la la it was a magnifico presentation...the friendly service and attention made us feel like we were wisked away to a charming location in italy...you have got to try it!! we are going back to try many different dishes."}
{"text":"La Calabria strives to fill the void of \"authentic\" Italian food in the East Valley.  Does it succeed?  So-so.   Most of the dishes are served with a salad, which is on the bland side.  The bread before the meal was also stale (what gives?!).  The main event did somewhat redeem the dinner, however.  We tried the linguine rusticana and the veal scaloppine principessa.  Both were fairly good!  The linguine dish had nice flavor, and the shrimp was perfectly cooked.  Unlike most american italian restaurants, La Calabria highlights the pasta itself rather than coating it with way too much sauce.  The veal was also nice with good portion size, though it was a little heavy on the olive oil.  Price is high.  I usually expect Italian to be a bit spendy.  However, part of that high price comes with what's usually an above-average ambience.  La Calabria is lacking in that department.  It's in a strip mall, which isn't a big deal, but you would expect the inside decor to be fixed up a bit more for that price.  It isn't exactly dumpy, but it's rather plain.  Service was friendly but slow.  It took a while to get the food, and similarly a long delay for the check once we were done eating.  I don't know if it was an off-night.  3.5-stars earned for the main dishes (which is why you're here really).  The other aspects of the meal (see above) bring it to a 3."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday night in lieu of all my normal restaurants were booked/crowded. Found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I was tentative of trying a Ristorante because most places are non-traditional and make more of \"fusion\" dishes.  This place is as authentic as it gets without going to an Italian community or Italy itself.    The Chicken Amalfitano was honestly, \"TO DIE FOR\".  All ingredients were fresh, prepared perfectly, and the side of potatoes and green beans were matched well with the dish.  The demi glace tied the whole dish together.  Calimari was cooked perfectly as well.  Lightly breaded to highlight the squid.  You will not find Tartar sauce or Cocktail sauce in this restaurant!  They make a fresh tomato and garlic tip that I can almost eat by itself.  Dessert was just as good as the appetizer and main course.  I had a mascarpone gelato & a pistachio gelato.    One thing I care more than good food is service.  Clara (I believe she is the co-owner), came by at least 3 times to check up on us.  The server and staff ensured that our drinks were always filled, our mouths were stuffed, and that we were always satisfied.  When you get great service with outstanding food, you get a 5-star rating.  Adding this restaurant on my top 5 list for Arizona."}
{"text":"This is our go to place when visiting family. Service:  The service is wonderful, the wait staff is very helpful and the chef will make things to order. We were seated quickly and did not have to wait long before our meals came out. Place: the place is very clean. The decor is a little dated but that is just my humble opinion. Food: Food is very good for the west coast. Nothing like when I used to live in NYC but as most natives can tell you from moving east to west the Italian food is usually Olive Garden quality at the best. This place is much better than an Olive Garden and one of my faves away from where I grew up. Back home it would barely rate but after 13 years in WA, AZ area this is some of the best in the west. The calamari is very good and you can't go wrong with their pasta dishes, they taste homemade. The salads are a real let down though. Plain and soggy seems like an afterthought, avoid the salad and save room for the main meal. Drinks are really good too, some interesting ones that I haven't see elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this mom and pop restaurant for years. There is nothing better than knowing the owners by name and enjoying dinner over a bottle of wine and good food.   While I agree that the ambience could improve, which would drive up sales, there is no mistaking that this is a gem of Gilbert.   The calamari is always a go-to. The marinara sauce is fantastic. Their pasta dishes are great. Freshly made pasta. I always suggest trying their special of the day. You can't go wrong.   Speaking of not going wrong, the cheesecake is none like any you will try. I think the prices are extremely reasonable for good Italian food."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there and ordered two pasta dishes-- total bill was about $40.00 (no alcohol, dessert, or appetizer ordered).    Positive: Service was great and we were seated immediately.   Negative: Overall, the food was mediocre and the portion sizes were extremely small for the price. Dinner came with a side salad which was okay, but small. Bread was provided upon request."}
{"text":"I love this place. After moving from CA to AZ this summer, we finally found a new favorite that we have been missing!  The food is amazing."}
{"text":"This is a hidden little gem in our neighborhood in Gilbert. I had heard about it, and have wanted to try, so my parents' visit was the perfect opportunity. The staff was very attentive, the older Italian gentleman who was our waiter was very charming, and the food was excellent. The calamari fritti was light and tender, the melon and prosciutto appetizer was out of this world, and the shrimp scampi, linguine and clams, and tuna special were delicious. They do it in the classic Italian style: unhurried and relaxed. The location is kind of hidden, which is a shame, because you can't see it from the street very well. It's not fancy, but it's homey and family friendly. The prices are very reasonable, too (always a bonus). We will go back, for sure."}
{"text":"Food wasn't anything special, and no diaper changing stations in the bathrooms. The staff is very friendly though."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! The food is authentic Italian... the best I've ever had. So glad we found this place! I've been two times so far and the vodka sauce was incredible! And... the prices are surprisingly inexpensive."}
{"text":"LOVE this place, it is our go-to spot for date night! We are now greeted like family haha. The chef/owner is always coming out and talking to guests or serving food. I feel like I am eating at grandma's house, good food and homey atmosphere. The food is very good, I have not had something I do not like there. I would recommend the specials though, the chef makes the pasta for them himself, delish!  *be prepared to spend awhile here, not a good place for a quick dinner! Relax and enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian Restaurants in Arizona. Not to be missed. Chef is off the boat from Calabria. Food is extremely authentic. They have regular specials. Home made ricotta cheese cake is a must. Food cooked to order. Never a bad meal. Brett Russo."}
{"text":"Wow, great food, great service, fair prices.  This is a great place. This is a wonderful alternative to eating in a chain restaraunt."}
{"text":"Lived in NY and NJ for ten years and this is authentic Italian.  Owner/chef is always in the dining room making sure you are  enjoying the food. The deserts are Unreal!"}
{"text":"Super cute, authentic Italian food with great service and fantastic food! Would recommend it to anyone-first good Italian place I've been to since moving to Arizona 5 years ago :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Gilbert, really great pasta. The creme brulee desert is amazing. The people working there are great as well, we loved the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had date night with the wife tonight and went to an old go to when they were located off of Ray rd. Love the new location. Nice and quaint. Service was exceptional and the food was good. I remember the marina having a little more spice and tang to it but the food was still great. Wife had the eggplant parmigiana and it was easily a 5 Star meal. I had spaghetti and meatballs which I get wherever I go. It was 4 Star. We will definitely be back. Enjoy the staff and the family business atmosphere. You won't go wrong here. Good date spot."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic that La Calabria reopened in Gilbert! Their lasagna is the best, and we just love the owners. The food is reasonably priced, and drinks aren't expensive. One of our favorites, and I'm so happy they're back!"}
{"text":"We loved what we ate: two kind of fish specialities, the crispy calamari appetizer and of course real tiramisu and a very good vanilla cannoli. The taste was Italian authentic. We'll be back here."}
{"text":"While visiting from Chicago, we took my Mom to dinner before we left. I'm so glad we found this place! I'd have rated this higher if it were possible. Although Diane is correct, the atmosphere isn't linen tablecloths and napkins - the food and service were as good as it gets! And I'd take food and service over table cloths any day! Clara and Giovanni make a fantastic team. We had a smoked salmon appetizer that was to die for. And the vodka cream sauce was supreme. The portions are big - but save room for tiramisu for dessert! We will definitely be back. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Food was just average. Price was high. Decor is below average. service was very good. Wouldn't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Amazing! Being from the NJ/NY, this place is by far the closest thing you will find to AUTHENTIC Italian food in Arizona. The owners are there and make sure that your experience is nothing short of incredible. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food may good, but I wouldn't know.  We were rudely greeted after standing at the counter for 10 minutes.  Once we were seated we waited another 15 and were not even spoken to or provided with water.  I got the feeling they were annoyed my wife an I had the audacity to patronize their restaurant.  Maybe they just had a bad night and were short staffed, who knows because no one ever communicated.  We won't be going back, on the positive side the place we went to after they drove us away was awesome!"}
{"text":"Normally whenever I have entered an Italian restaurant, the wonderful smells of garlic and other spice permeate the entire place!  Entering your place no odor, \"Nothing\"  no odor of any kind. The ambiance of your place is nil, it doesn't look Italian, no warmth more like a cafeteria, white table cloths are nice, in an Italian place without color \"is like a day without sunshine.\" The hostess was nice, but wanted to push drinks, \"we don't drink\" and that little display turned me off. We waited for 10 minutes to get bread, which seemed it was served before to another customer, and rewrapped for presentation a new customer. The bread had a hard finish, as though it had dried out from exposures' to the air, was not warm, the butter could not be spread because it was so cold. Can't forget the drink, I did buy a drink I think you need a new bartender, it was poorly mixed, $7.00 was too much. The salad was OK,  it tasted as though it was from a bag, processed in a factory. The main course, had no flavor, although the chicken was tender, the gravy had no flavor, it was suppose to have a lemon taste, it was not very good. The $75.00 was an expensive dinner that did taste poorly, Although the plating was done well!, I sat and watched the line cooks, a particular one took his hat off and scratched his head,  replaced his cap  and then went on cooking. Well, my friend's once is enough, you won't see me there again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been several times with a friend for lunch. She gets the La Calabria salad and i get the eggplant parmesan sandwich. The salad is light n greens but rich in mozzarella, grilled chicken, roasted peppers and tomatoes. The sandwich is on a delicious roll.  Thinly sliced eggplant with a light breading in a tasty sauce. This has got to be the best Italian in the east valley."}
{"text":"Great potential!  Plan to return soon.  This newly opened neighborhood gem was buzzing on the night we tried.  While they are working the kinks out, the food was great.   The treated my grandmother and young twins special and worked to meet our unique needs.  While the food was outstanding, a broader wine selection would serve them well.  They were very busy and stopped by often to provide updates on this busy night."}
{"text":"Excellent!!  Reasonable prices, pasta made fresh every day and you can tell, delicious. Nice little bar. Food was tasty. Thank you and welcome to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"We found La Calabria when we first moved here 7 years ago. We were so sad when it closed and so HAPPY when it reopened! Giovanni and Clara greet us as if we are old friends and Giovanni is truly a gifted chef. The lasagna is my favorite, the arancini are delicious, the garlic bread is awesome, and the marinara sauce is so fresh! I am surprised about the negative comments about the quality of the food and the portions. We have not found a better Italian restaurant in the area and the portions are always more than I can eat, and I like to eat a lot! I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for high-quality, delicious Italian food."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food, and service, really really good!!!!! We stumbled on this nice Italian place hidden behind a tire store, but, the location is the only negative and who really cares about that anyway. Started with the arrancini as an appetizer amazing, almost ordered more to make a meal of it, but glad we didn't and moved on to the main course. Wife and I both had veal dishes, she the veal piccata, me the sorrentino, both tender, flavorful, and very generous portions. Sautéed broccoli with it cooked perfect, and, the pasta, homemade with bolognaise sauce, just like homemade, so good. The chef Giovanni stopped by to see how we were doing, very classy.  We will definitely eat here again next time we visit the area."}
{"text":"We took our daughter out to celebrate her 1st day of school and she wanted pizza. We had heard about La Calabria and went there. They do NOT serve pizza, but the hostess (I think it was the owner as well) convinced her that pasta and meatballs would be just as yummy and thankfully, today our 3 year old wasn't her typical stubborn self and  went for it...much to our delight as we had been wanting to try this place. THANKS GOODNESS!!! It turned out to be an incredible find for Italian food, locally owned 'mom and pop' type of place so close to our home.  We had some wine which was very good and reasonably priced. They brought out some soft and fresh Italian bread with some of the most delish olive oil/seasonings dip I've ever had.  The chef (maybe the other owner?) came out personally to serve our daughter her meal. He offered her the parm sprinkled on her dinner, after the 3rd \"yes\" of offering her more, he asked if she just wanted the whole bowl, which made her very happy. Us too, it was some of the best parmesean cheese I've ever tasted. So fresh and tasty. She loved the meatballs, said they were as good as Nona's (her Italian grandma) so that says a lot right there!  My husband and I shared one of the daily specials, a penne with a sausage and mushroom sauce. It was a cross between a red and a white sauce, sort of like a vodka sauce but not exactly. I don't think they make their pasta from scratch, but my oh my, you couldn't cook prepared pasta any better! It was done perfectly al dente and the sauce was simply INCREDIBLE, if I had just one word to choose. I'm sure it was more calories/fat than I would care to know...but it was so good I didn't care. It was also great that for a small fee of $5 they let us share, giving us both our own salad. The pasta portions were still very big, we each came home with leftovers.  We decided to go for it all and end the night with cappuccino and dessert. The cappuccino was perfect, nice and large with a wonderful foam. They have 4 or 5 homemade in-house desserts but the gelato menu spoke to us. We got the bananas foster gelato which was just delectable. Perfect banana flavor, not too powerful, served a little more frozen than usual, so it stayed in a wedge shape, and half of it was dipped in Italian chocolate and nuts. My mouth is watering just remembering it.   If you live in Gilbert, or nearby Chandler and are looking for a family run restaurant, with a casual atmosphere and wonderful food, give this place a try...my guess is you'll be hooked. We can't wait to go back. Prices are about the same as Olive Garden or the like...not cheap but not expensive...pretty much what you'd expect. Oh and the kids meal was a deal at $5 with about 2 to 3 servings for the average child, and comes with a 'surprise' which was ice cream and made our daughter very happy, a great ending to a milestone day for her...and us!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Gilbert for 25 years and unfortunately, there are not many top level italian restaurants in the area ... until I discovered La Calabria last night dining with a friend.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals, she had the vodka penne pasta and I had the chicken parmigana.  Everything was excellent, from the bread, salad and entrees.  The service was prompt and friendly as we were waited on by the owner.  We will both definitely make La Calabria one of our \"go to\" places locally."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED. One of the things that shows a sign of bad management is to post hours of service and not honor them.  I was truly looking forward to eating here but I can only wonder about the quality of this establishment\"s food as I was turned away 45 minutes prior to closing. We were told it was because the chef decided to shut down the kitchen early. I hope the chef is the owner since he or she is making decisions that affect the bottom line. The only word that comes to mind is UNPROFESSIONAL."}
{"text":"Came here the other night after having been to the old location and wanted to support the owners at their new place. Both my grandma and I ordered the spaghetti bolognese, one gluten free and one regular. The flavor of the dish was so awful after the first bite we both looked at each other and said, \"dog food?\". I seriously couldn't not eat the pasta without gagging from the overwhelming taste of dog food with no tomato flavor whatsoever. I wasn't going to say anything, Ive never been one to send food back, so I just began eating the spinach pasta my mom had ordered, which was pretty good! As this was happening, our waitress came over and asked me if I hadn't liked my meal and if I would like them to make something else. I wasn't going to say anything but it was obvious that I wasn't eating what I had ordered so I said \"yeah I wasn't a fan of it, but no worries I'm sharing this one!\" At this point the female owner comes to the table and starts interrogating me on \"what specifically\" I didn't like. So I said, \"I just didn't really like the flavor, it just tasted like meat to me\" and in the most rude and condescending voice you've ever heard she says, \"Dear, do you even know what bolognese is..?\" One bad food dish wasn't enough to cause me to not go back to this place, but the rudeness of the owners is unacceptable. I felt so uncomfortable just sitting in there. My grandma eventually asked for a to-go box to throw her food away in the garbage outside the restaurant, because she didn't want \"a lecture with her meal\". It is easy to say that no one in my family will ever be back."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Italian menu.  Great service...feels like you are being welcomed to their home. Food was very good but pricey.  Definitely some of the best Italian in the area, but will likely reserve for special occasions."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new restaurant to try in our area and came across La Calabria on Yelp.  It was in a strip mall so not very impressive from the outside but the decor is nice, the waitstaff was incredibly friendly and helpful and the food was terrific!  My husband had one of the specials and I had a pasta off of the menu and we both cleaned our plates!  We can't wait to go back.    Added bonus - We have a 2 year old so are always looking for a nice restaurant that is accepting of children.  It was definitely an \"adult\" place but did have a children's menu and crayons.  It was very child friendly although there was only one other child there during our meal.  Great find!"}
{"text":"I visited La Calabria with high hopes of finding my \"go to\" italian restaurant, but I can now cross it off my lisit of places to dine. I did so based off the countless high reviews it had been given on yelp and google.  I started my night off by ordering the beef carpaccio however what arrived was battered fried cheese with a bowl of canned tomato sauce.   I decided to eat this concoction because our waiter was new and clearly nervous.  The appetizer tasted about as good as it looked which i would rate as average at best.   Next we were served out salads, the house and caesar.  Both salads followed right in line with our appetizer, average but severly overdressed.   Our main course consisted of the Linguini ai Frutti di Mare and Meat Ravioli, which our server recommended.  The ravioli was what i would expect from an Olive Garden caliber restaurant.  The Ligunie is where I took offense.  The basic concepts of cooking this dish were missing.  This is my favoite dish and something I consider a staple of a good Italian restaurant.  The pasta was overcooked to a mushy consistency.  The Seafood was generous however was also overcooked.  All of this was served in what appeared to be a tomatoy soup that was filled to the brim of the bowl.  I ate the entire meal with fear I would have this red water in my lap or all over the table.  I am confused by the numerous high ratings for La Calabria.  I have grown up eating great italian and recently moved to Phoenix.  If my only experience of italian food  was eating Chuck E Cheese I might be more inclined to give 3 stars.   If you are looking for a great Italian meal look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I went for dinner at the new location and it was quite a disappointment. The first thing that I did not like  I was not greeted when I walked in, the owner and a waitress were talking and it was not until they were done that I was greeted and seated. Next we were brought a glass of water with no ice. After that we were brought a basket of sliced bread, (two slices) and a couple packs of butter, maybe they thought I wanted to make a sandwich. We ordered an appetizer, calamari for $14.00 which was a good portion but it had no taste and was like chewing rubber, it was either cooked to long or to short. For the main course my wife had lasagna which was very old and dried out with no taste but was a good portion. I had linguini with shrimp, clams, mussles, scallops and calamari. Again it was a good portion but everything was very bland and the calamari was like eating rubber. Probably what set the tone for this negative review was the glass of water with no ice and most of all the bread. I have never been to a restaurant that did not give either garlic bread or Italian bread with oil, cheese and pepper for dipping. This is an American restaurant trying to be Italian. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I understand La Calabria Restaurant has closed!  Can anyone tell me why?  I had heard so many good things about them!!  Bummer!!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible!  The service is perfect with the husband-and-wife welcoming you as soon as you open the doors. I am in the service business and was blown away here...this is what is missing In your dinner rotation. If you want kids serving you, go to Olive Garden...if you want professionals come here.   The waiters and waitresses are amazing and the food is terrific! I can highly recommend getting the special.s as they are NOT what the chef / owner wants to get rid of...they are the best food on the menu.  Tonight it was the crab and lobster ravioli in Alfredo sauce. Almost to die for...seriously the best seafood Alfredo I have ever had! The waiter even made a joke that they have dishwashers as I sopped up the last Alfredo sauce with a piece of bread! My wife had the mushroom risotto and She absolutely enjoyed it! We got a slice of cheesecake to go home for dessert and we absolutely will be back!   Get here now and you'll never \"forget about it\" (worst DeNiro accent I can do)!"}
{"text":"Came here this evening for the first time.  We were greeted right away by the hostess and seated promptly. I had the Ciopinno and my husband had the pork tenderloin Marsala. Both items were some of the specials that evening. Both entrees were magnificent. The ciopinno had plenty of fresh fish and seafood and the pasta was just perfect. My husbands said his pork was fabulous. I can't say enough great things about LaCalabria. I am just thinking about when I can come back. Oh, the cheesecake was out of this world! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"If I was to rate La Calabria purely on food? Well beyond 5 stars. I'm a North Jersey native and when it comes to that heavenly, authentic homestyle Italian I crave so much... this place NAILS IT! Fresh, high quality ingredients, incredible marinara, homemade everything... there's love on that plate.  The ONLY reason I sit on the fence sometimes when we're looking for a night out is the atmosphere. The lovely couple who owns the place really do their best to make it comfortable and I can get over the strip mall vibe (this is AZ after all), but in order to make it a perfect experience I would LOVE for them to move to a stand-alone little place with more coziness, maybe some outdoor seating.   Overall, La Calabria is well worth trying if you haven't. If you have, then you know it's a gem (in a strip mall)."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here, last night, for our 10 year anniversary. It was pretty good. The service was slow except for the busboy who was excellent at refilling our water glasses. The restaurant had the bare minimum in decor and atmosphere which is annoying because the prices here are high and should be accompanied with excellent atmosphere. My husband got the Spinach Fettucine meal and it was just ok... the sauce wasn't very tasteful and it was presented on a plate. Which would be fine except the sauce was so liquidity that it was a poor choice of plating because you couldn't really enjoy the whole meal together. I got the Chicken Balsamico which was absolutely delicious! I recommend it! Also, the menu says homemade pasta but I wouldn't have been able to tell it was actually homemade if I wasn't told it was. I have had homemade pasta before and this was just eh. Our server was nice but she took about 25 minutes to bring us our check as she was preoccupied with other tables and being in the back. Anyways.... I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic meal! We started off with a couple of appetizers  and then had stuffed peppers, the special! Our waiter was fantastic and recommended great food for us! Clara, the owner, was out to greet us and really welcomed us to her restaurant! For certain, we will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but waaaaaaay overpriced, and small portions.  Maybe this just isn't the place for take out?  Not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"I was told about this restaurant by a co-worker and then she gave me a gift certificate there for my birthday. It is tucked away in  a strip mall. Not the best location for visibility which makes it difficult for any restaurant to succeed. I am not a big Italian food fan but because she highly recommended it and gave me a gift certificate my husband and I went. The decor is about the best you can do in a strip mall, but that is not what is important to me. It is the taste of the food. I asked our server (the wife of the chef) what was best to order in their restaurant. She said lasagna. I don't like lasagna. But, if she recommended it then I wanted to try it. She also recommended a wine with it and since I am not much of a wine drinker, she offered to bring me 3 different ones to try first so that I ordered one that I liked. I thought that was great! When the lasagna came out to our table, I was delighted it was a nice size serving since my husband is a big eater and he always finishes my meal for me. I took the first bit and immediately noticed how it just melted in my mouth. The noodles are so buttery thin that you it does not overpower the flavors of the sauce and cheese. I was hooked! This is the best lasagna I have ever tasted and I have eaten in Little Italy in NYC over 25 times and this was much better! My husband had the ravioli which was also delicious. By the way, the olive oil for dipping the bread in is the freshest and best flavor I have ever had. I asked if they sold it because I wanted to take it home with me. They get it from Italy and so do not sell it. At the end of my meal, she brought me out a to-go container full of their olive oil. How is that for service?!! This is my go to restaurant for Italian food!"}
{"text":"What a gem this place is, from the look of the restaurant, the wait staff and the food!!  My family and I went there yesterday for a birthday party.   We were the first to be seated for Sunday dinner.   Their wait staff is superb, giving us plenty of time to order, bringing crayons and pages to color for the kids, splitting checks, whatever you need!  Everyone in our eleven person party loved their entree.  They have the best lobster ravioli....complete with fresh cheese if you want it, scallops and shrimp in the sauce.   My husband had a lobster  spaghetti special, with a half lobster, mussels and clams on their shells, shirimp and scallops.  Everything was scrumptious, hot and perfectly prepared.  And did I mention that Italian is NEVER my first choice when we go out.  This restaurant will definitely be on my short list of favorite places to dine after last night!   Do yourself a favor and check out this little hole in the wall place, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Walked in... made eye contact with a couple servers and the hostess and hung out for awhile, and was finally seated after about 3 min of awkwardly standing there. Couldn't really understand the majority of the mumbling coming out of our servers mouth. Had a black curly hair in my salad. Dinner was mediocre at best... not impressed with the quality of the food for the price. Wish I would've went to the Chinese place next door."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I got surprised big time tonight.  I've been to La Calabria a few times before with family and they have always been good.  Tonight they blew me away.  I've only had two Italian restaurants blow me away before, tonight at La Calabria and another night at Cucina Urbana in San Diego..  I had the linguini with white clam sauce and my wife had the Pappadelle with mushroom sauce.  Both were made to perfection.  The pasta was al dente and homemade making such a difference.  My clam sauce dish came with a ring of wonderfully sweat clams surrounding the top of the pasta.  The chucks of garlic were large and perfect sized so not to overwhelm the dish.   So many places get this wrong and smash up garlic and overpowering a dish but this was perfect.    The bread was rustic and hard crusted and served with a seasoned Olive OIl that had sun dried tomatoes and herbs.  I used the last of it to sop up the clam sauce that escaped my pasta leaving only a slight indication my plate ever had food on it.    The service was great and the owners were both around to make sure everything was great.    My wife is a first generation Italian and between her and the family, I have always been kept well satisfied with homemade Italian food.  They hold this place in very high regard and now I fully understand why.  They are the ultimate food critics particularly when it comes to Italian and La Calabria gets the nod  every time. .    A tip you may want to consider is to order Gaetano Sambuca with a side of espresso to end the evening. The Sambuca is a lower-proof version and has a perfect mellow flavor to it."}
{"text":"A great Italian dinner ... great food and gracious services... a favorite ... good time ... wine and stuffed salmon tonight"}
{"text":"We didn't get to try the food. I read the reviews and thought that there was no way that they would charge $8.00 if you are sharing your plate with someone else, but they really do! The waitress was an older lady and extremely rude when she sat us like we were burdening her. Then when we ordered 2 entres for 3 of us to split she said \"get another order and take it home or they will charge you $8.00\". My husband said that he just wouldn't eat. Then the guy comes from the back and tells us the same thing, if we didn't order another plate, he would charge us 8.00! It was the rudest thing I have ever heard. I'm Italian and Italians share! It's just what we do! We got up and left. The prices are pretty high anyway and then to charge a large amount just because you aren't hungry is ridiculous! I won't go back. I don't believe this restaurant will be in business for very much longer. No one wants bad service. We are a friendly town and when people come in that are rude like this no one wants to patronize there."}
{"text":"Food here was very authentic and i was impressed since I am Italiano from Chicago and LA....Very good food."}
{"text":"La Calabria is a cute little restaurant tucked away from the street in Gilbert. You walk in and are instantly greeted by the Italian owner with his hairy chest and giant gold cross around his neck. The restaurant is fairly small but it's warm and inviting.  The food was magnificent! We ordered the ravioli and lasagna. The ravioli was in a refreshing tomato sauce that tasted like it was ACTUALLY made from fresh tomatoes! And don't get me started on the lasagna! It was out of this world!!!!!! The cheese had so much flavor and the sauce was the same fresh tomato sauce as the ravioli and it came out hot and steamy. Both came with a side salad which had more than just lettuce (onion, olives, tomato and cucumber) plus it came with a light and delicious balsamic dressing.  We didn't try the wine, we pregammed at home to avoid extra cost. But the wine list was a fair size with reasonable prices. Overall our meal costs about $32, which is a bit more than we would have liked but it won't keep us from going back! Definetly will return for the lasagna!"}
{"text":"Lovely. I sought this out during a business trip as I was in an Italian mood. So good I went back 2 nights later.  On the first night, I had the arrancini (delicious risotto balls with meat, in a tomato-based sauce.)  The arrancini were crisp and flavorful. Only issue was that the very center were still chilly.  Didn't stop me from scarfing every delicious bite down.  The pasta special that evening was mafaldine with thinly sliced Italian sausage in a tomato-based sauce finished with a touch of cream. This was heavenly. I had never had mafaldine before...think the rippled edge of a lasagne noodle, but in single long thin strands like fettucine. The pasta was perfectly chewy, and a great shape for clinging to the thick sauce. Owners are the chef and his wife who took care of me both visits. She asked if I wanted a little heat in the dish, so they added the perfect amount of fire...maybe red pepper flakes?  Not sure. The pasta and sausage were copious. The accompanying free salad was basic. I was too full for dessert.  On the 2nd visit I skipped an appetizer and ordered the meat tortellini.  I love tortellini with peas and they were accomodating to add them for me. The meal was lovely, and again, bountiful. Only complaint here was the pasta was a wee overcooked. I wish the tortellina had the perfect chew of the malfadine on my first visit.  Their cheesecake has been rated one of the best in the Phoenix valley.  This is not a typical NY style cream cheese cake. Rather it's ricotta-based, with subtle citrus flavors. These are scratch made in house along with several other dessert options. It was different, and fantastic. Light, but with rich texture like you want in a cheesecake.  I like that they specify on their dessert menu which items they make in the restaurant, vs. those which are outsourced.  Wines were a small but well-edited selection of reasonable options, all Italian. All available by the glass.  Who serves Barbera by the glass??  that was so nice.  Ambiance is that of a simple family owned spot in a strip mall. Spotlessly clean and modest. Not formal by any means.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if half stars were an option."}
{"text":"We have been to La Calabria a couple of times and the food has been excellent. The butternut squash ravioli is fantastic. Service is a little overwhelming. Give me some time to read the menu please.  A little pricey for what you get. Made the mistake of having the house chianti. We did not care for it."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade pasta.  The veal was excellent also.  The calamari and stuffed mushroom appetizers were great."}
{"text":"The food and service is tremendous!  The \"gravy\" is to die for.  Wish I could give La Calabria a higher score than a 5!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this restaurant while out Christmas shopping this evening. What a pleasant surprise it was to find this gem in Gilbert. I don't think I've ever been to a more authentic Italian restaurant, everything was amazing from the staff to the food!! The calamari was the best I've had in years and our entrées were out of this world, we were so full we took Tiramisu to go and it was amazing!! We will definitely be back and next time make a reservation, we were so lucky we happened to get in as a walk in tonight!!"}
{"text":"The salad that comes with the meal was nice.  Different kinds of lettuce, it was nice and fresh.   I had the linguini with clam red sauce, it was very tasty. For desert I had the pistachio gelato, that was really good too. Everything was really exceptional.  I would go back for more."}
{"text":"This is our first visit . . . First impression: food is above average but service can be improved. I think because they just relocated to this location, the staff spend way too much time mingling with old a customers and ignored new guests."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars, except for a couple of things that really impacted our experience: the hostess was very slow-extreeeemly slow- in seating us. The waiter was also very, very slow in retrieving our drinks, taking our order, and following up. Customer service has to be #1 if you are adjacent to another (potentially competitive) seafood restaraunt. That being said, the Lobster ravioli was amazing! It also had scallops, shrimp, & crabmeat in the sauce. Amazing. The veal with proscuitto was awesome, and the cheesecake was the best i havs ever had. This place is like an honors student with behavioral issues. It could easily be a 5/5 if they were more attentive to their customers and managed efficiency better."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this for the first time. The service was great, the food was delicious. I had the Ai Fungi and my husband had the lobster and shrimp ravioli special. We will absolutely be back and we can't wait bring our family and friends."}
{"text":"I ate here with my wife for our anniversary, it was some of the best traditional Italian food we've had!   Not only is the food much more authentic than Olive Garden of some other bigger franchises, they actually serve it in the authentic manner- meaning that each course is prepared only when you are finished with the current one. All the individual foods and desserts are literally freshly made.   If you are looking for a cost-efficient, authentic Italian dinner and have an hour or two to enjoy it, this is the place."}
{"text":"Best and most authentic Italian food we've had in Arizona! It's a fairly small location, but was absolutely packed when we got there (always a good sign!).   I ordered the mushroom risotto, which was much better than I anticipated, and my husband got the bucatini carbonara. Both dishes were made to perfection and I know we will be back on our next date night!   Another \"plus\" of this restaurant is that they make all of their own pasta in house, and it's served al dente (the way it should be)."}
{"text":"After seeing such great reviews on Yelp, I decided to take the gf to this little Italian place in Gilbert. I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this place, and the owner was really nice. But.....all I can muster up was a meh. First, the decore just doesn't seem to fit the restaurant name. The name says to me, nice Italian restaurant. We walked in, it seemed....sparten. There's just something missing that makes it feel Italian. Anything...some rustic decoration? Idk. I really think the ambiance can be much better if they did something.... It was mostly just plain walls with some murals. Anyhow, I'm not here to eat the food, not the wall decore. We ordered some Clams Casino s for appetizer. The gf ordered Chicken Campagnola and I ordered Veal Scaloppine Principessa. So the clams.... Cardinal sin #1, you never ever serve sandy clams. You must soak the clams in fresh water for at least 20 minutes to rid of the salt and sand. Well, the gf and I tried 2 clams each and every single one of them were sandy. Crunch crunch crunch. Uck. I am grateful that that item was taken off our bill. Just for that I think they deserve half a star more. On to the entrees. While the flavors were not bad, I do feel like the food is towards average than good. My veal was slightly over cooked but fairly tasty with the sauce on top. It just didn't give me the vibe of this is so good I want it again. My gf's chicken was definitely way overcooked. It was tough and the sauce was on the salty side (and I'm a salt junkie). Overall, I dare say I've had better food at certain Macaroni Grill chains so..... I do really want to like this place because it's so close to where we live..... But for the food they serve, I think they can be $3-4 less. I would've gladly pay the price if the food had impressed me. Alas, the search for a great Italian restaurant with reasonable price continues....."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Gilbert/Chandler area. Been here 4 times and the food has been amazing each time. The Lobster Ravioli is a favorite. Also, best chicken Marsala I have had."}
{"text":"They're back! Love this place! Outstanding food and friendly service. Best Italian food in the valley."}
{"text":"I tried to eat here one day and when I walked up to the door DURING BUSINESS hours and tried to open it the woman rudely told me that they were 'clearly not open' because they were having a meeting. I live right around the corner from you guys and you certainly won't be getting my business!"}
{"text":"Friendly. Casual. Quality Italian meal. Owners present and attentive. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to La Calabria and it was a delightful experience from beginning to end.   I was seated promptly and my drink order taken while waiting for my dining companion. I got a nice, reasonably priced, glass of Nero D'aviloa, and Italian bread and olive oil flavored with a chiffonade of fresh basil and some chopped sun dried tomato for drizzling. The basil was a nice, fresh touch.  Our knowledgeable server answered menu questions and took us through the extensive list of daily specials. I ended up with a gnochi, which was a plate full of potato pillows of cheesy heaven in a tomato vodka sauce. It was served with a salad with a house balsamic dressing which was well balanced and delicious.   My companion also had one of the daily special dishes, chicken picata, served with roasted potatoes and broccoli rabe. She said it was delicious.  Pacing throughout the meal was unrushed and good. My questions regarding the vegetarian-or-not properties of the meal were handled graciously.   Ambiance was unremarkable but nice enough for a strip-mall restaurant.   I would definitely recommend this little hidden gem to anyone. I will be back."}
{"text":"Friends really like this place. We were here before and not impressed but it was worse this time.  We ordered martinis...they were tiny. I complained and the second was a little bigger but not $12 worth. My wife did not enjoy her lasagna.  I had clam spaghetti which was not memorable.  My Italian Chardonnay was the best thing I had."}
{"text":"Cute little place in a strip mall. I have passed that intersection hundreds of times and never knew this place was back there! It is on the pricey side for a family dinner out, but for a date night or night out with friends this would be worth it! Overall they had good food, yummy desserts, and homemade pasta - while supporting a local ma and pa restaurant - makes  it that much better!"}
{"text":"First time back since they re-opened and did not disappoint. Good service, excellent food that is true Italian. They were gracious in any request we had. Only comment is that the red wine was a bit on the warm side. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food, service, ambiance -- that's why I go to a restaurant. I suspect I am not alone.  La Calabria *nails* in on two of those three criteria. The food was fantastic. I had the Cannelloni - a simple dish, but done wrong it can be a miserable experience. La Calabria did it right. Way right.   My lovely bride had the Chicken Marsala. Given how she fended off my reaching fork, I'd say it was also outstanding.   Service was superior. And friendly. The owner stopped by twice just to make sure things were right. Our party of seven just mumbled and nodded our heads because our mouths were stuffed full of Italian goodness.  The only place La Calabria is lacking is in ambiance. They've done about everything they can with the space but it's not real warm and cozy. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, just not as perfect as the food and service.   Yelp needs to allow half-stars, because La Calabria really is a 4.5 star kind of place.   Go. Eat. Be Merry."}
{"text":"Our friends who live in Gilbert really like this restaurant. They have talked of it often. We dined there recently at our request. This is a mom and pop operation which operates in a space in a strip mall. The location doesn't concern me. Many fine restaurants are to be found in a mall setting. The problem we faced this visit was that the owner who runs the front was home sick. She normally takes care of our friends and service suffered. Service wasn't awful but our friends could tell the difference. The food was good but not five star.  The prices were on the high end but not extreme.  My clam linguine was decent but I have had better elsewhere. My wife was happier with her tortellini in cream sauce. The salad that is included was good. We didn't have dessert. If our friends suggest it, we would be willing to try it again."}
{"text":"Average in every way. The atmosphere is non existent, real table cloths and napkins totally clash with the office type lighting leaving you feel somewhere between a school cafeteria and a cheap Chinese buffet.   The service was good, can't complain there. The food was meh. The stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer were decent but the seafood \"risotto\" was not good. First of all, it wasn't a risotto, it was rice with seafood, they completely missed the risotto taste and texture, the clams were chewy and rubbery, and the overall taste was bland. Disappointing.   Maybe we ordered the wrong entrees but I certainly don't understand people raving about this place and it's definitely not the best Italian place I've been to. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Food delicious and made to order.  Complex, delicious, and one of the best Italian experiences we have ever had.  The chef was out and about discussing wine and food.  The service is knowledgable, personable, and prompt.  The Grouper Cioppino was delightfully spicy (optional without all the spice).  The mozzy bread with marinara is possibly my favorite app in years.  Wife had the beef ravioli, dad the lasagna, mom the chicken piccata and it was universally lauded as their favorite Italian in years.  We came from Iowa so won't be back for a while, but the parents plan on making it a regular haunt. Go get all the food.  You are welcome."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food tastes just like nonna's, pasta made in house, and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food is so good and I would give 5 stars if the service wasn't so horrid. The woman at the front always seems confused.  The waitresses seem to be lacking common server skills...like reaching in front of you to put the plate down for the person next to you. Have to ask for water refills. I realize it is a family business but they need to have professional wait staff.  Training is in order. Food is fabulous."}
{"text":"Wow - An authentic Italian restaurant!  We lived in Italy for a year and know the difference between Olive Garden and the real thing.  I've eaten at La Calabria 5 or 6 times and have always been pleased.  Every meal is served hot,  and every entree we've tried has been exquisite.  My favorite is the eggplant rollatine; the smooth and creamy ricotta-based filling is so satisfying.  My husband likes the chicken marsala.  But the penne alla vodka is heavenly too.  Last week I had a luncheon at my house for 20 VIPs, and asked Giovanni to prepare the entire meal.  The guests raved and I was thrilled that the food was (1) ready on time, (2) delicious, (3) ample, and (4) very affordable.  Clara's fluffy Italian cheesecake topped the meal off wonderfully.   Do yourself a favor -- take a friend and go there NOW.  We all need to support GOOD independent restaurants, and this one is better than good."}
{"text":"So glad Gilbert has authentic Italian restaurant! The lobster ravioli is absolutely delicious, it was so hard to chose what to get because there were so many great options. I ended up going with the Sunday Spacial, which was a insane portion of 4 different types of meat cooked in a red sauce on top of penne noodles, worth making a reservation for! Personal service and very attentive staff."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, awesome service and nice specials!  Everything I want in an Italian restuarant and it's right next door!"}
{"text":"Third time here and haven't been disappointed yet.  The seafood is fresh, the veal was nice, and service is very good.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I need to put out a couple \"qualifiers\" before I get into the details of our dinner at La Calabria this evening...  First, this 4-star rating is the combination of my bride's 4.5-Star rating and my own 3.5-Star rating.  Secondly, I speak with the background of a Chicago boy of Calabrese Italian descent, with 50+ years living in Chicago.  So I suppose the bar was set pretty high.  That said, let's cover all the Pro's:  Even though the place was pretty busy when we walked in at 7:00, the hostess - Clara - was thoughtful and attentive. She made a \"party of 2\"  table for us within several minutes. Nicely done!  Water, bread & oil (good, hearty bread) came promptly.  The Italian-accented waiter graciously apoligized for his delay (quite unnecessary) and took our appetizer, wine & entree order promptly.  Fried Calamari was lightly breaded, plentiful and decent; not too chewy. Thumbs up!  Salads were mixture of Romaine and Iceberg, with cucumbers, Italian olives, radish and tomato slice. OK, that too was fine.  The bride had Risoto Quatro Formaggio, which even though looked a little runny, she said it tasted just perfect!  She ordered a glass of merlot and she enjoyed that as well.  Here's the Con's: I ordered a dish not on the menu, so I cannot be too critical-- Penne (with vodka sauce) with mozzarella baked on top.  It could've used a LOT more cheese... and I should've requested the vodka sauce be omitted (but that's my fault, not their's).  2nd Con: their pricing was definately of \"linen tablecloth\" caliber, yet there was no linen.  I feel that if you're going to charge those prices, offer that extra \"ambiance\"- even if you're proud of your casual atmosphere. You shouldn't have it both ways.  The check came promptly, as we passed on the dessert (although their dessert menu looked top-notch and truly authentic Italian).  So the service was very good; very attentive. Our waiter also asked how the food tasted.  I would make one final suggestion that their wait staff INTRODUCE themselves to the patrons.  We would go back. I think the place has plenty of positives... And the bride liked it, and we men know how much that matters.  Happy wife, hapy life!"}
{"text":"Just came back from dinner there. Let me preface by saying I had a gift certificate and without it am not sure I would have gone. Regardless. I'm not sure if I can write an essay but there are a number of things that jumped out at me. First and foremost, how friendly the owners are. Both husband and wife came to our table separately to chat. The other wait staff was ok, friendly but not out of the ordinary. Since bread usually comes first ... I have to say I was a bit disappointed being used to the piping hot loaves at Carabbas, or or other places that have a variety of rolls. These were like ordinary sliced white bread without much flavor. The specials sounded good but the server didn't give the prices till I asked specifically. MH was surprised not to see Corona in the beer selections. He also wanted the filet mignon which they were out of. He settled for the sole (which was good he said) and I had the Chicken Caprese special, but I had to make a special request to get basil included. Which seemed a bit counter intuitive but anyway. I wasn't crazy about it, or the wine sauce it came in. What I really wish had been different was the fact that it didn't come with pasta, but potatoes and vegetables. Not what I'd expect at an Italian restaurant. Sure, if it was a choice ... but it wasn't. Oh, and I didn't see pesto or alfredo sauce anywhere in the menu. Suffice it to say the owners are very nice but even that may not be enough to get me back. I like being excited over leftovers and tonight I'm just not. I did get a piece of cheesecake to bring home. Since it's going to be consumed in the next half hour I may have something to add ..."}
{"text":"I've been to La Calabria numerous times. For me, I enjoy stopping by later in the evening on a Friday, around 8:30 or so. The service is always good and I typically ask Giovanni what he recommends that day. I've never been disappointed and will continue to go back and support this local restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here again with friends over the weekend, being their first time here. They were impressed to say the least! Had a great meal...service was exceptional as always. They had a seafood dish...of Salmon, Muscles,Clams & Shrimp in a marinara sauce, on a bed of pasta. The seafood was cooked perfectly, and the Salmon obviously very fresh. The specialty garlic bread costs extra, but more then worth it if your garlic lover. My wife had a Talapia dish that she said was excellent!  I just hope they maintain the consistency with the quality of their food!!!"}
{"text":"The most amazing lasagna I've eaten that isn't my own!! Cheesy, baked to perfection and the sauce is so flavorful. The pasta is handmade and incredible. This is a MUST go to for me when I want good lasagna that I don't have to make!"}
{"text":"Out running errands and ran into a GEM of a find for lunch.  La Calabria is a quaint but wonderful surprise.  My husband and I are always looking for restaurants with authentic home cooked food. I feel like we walked into Mama's kitchen.  The Chicken Parmigiana was the best I've had in years.  The chicken was tender, pasta homemade and the sauce was remarkably fresh.  We found the staff delightful and the price to be fair.  One visit and I think you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"My wife and I were so happy to see this restaurant reopen in a much better location than they had. As an added bonus, they added a wood fired pizza oven so being one of my favorite things to eat I ordered one. It. Was. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is outstanding food.  We were there last night for my wife's birthday.  Dining out is often a stressful experience due to our 2 kids (3 and 7).  Kids drinks were filled quickly, and their food came out with our salads, which shows an experienced and smart waitstaff.  I had risotto and the wife had the Spinach Fettucini Rusticana.  Food was excellent.  Service was knowledgeable and friendly.  The wine list is sold (though not huge) and we had a couple of glasses of good Chianti.    Decor reminds me of a Tempe favorite Papa Razzini's.  Sparse, one big dining room, but comfortable.  There could be more ambiance, but I couldn't figure out how."}
{"text":"I wish I would have taken a picture of the two very delicious dishes we had tonight. We were fighting over the butternut ravioli to die for and the pork tenderloin in a fluffy pastry with porcini mushroom sauce, yummy!! Sooooo authentic and hands down the best Italian food in town!! I almost hate to tell the whole east valley about this little gem because I want to be sure I can get in as often as I would like, but it's to good not to brag about."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this truly authentic Italian food! It's as good as it gets! I have dined here many times now, and am even comfortable enough to just ask Giovanni (the owner and chef) to make me whatever he feels is best or special for the evening.  I have never once been disappointed. We have even used the restaurant for special events and had them provide a nice lunch or dinner for larger parties (grads, birthdays, proms, anniversaries, etc). You can't find a more honest relationship between you and your Italian food than with our own locals, Giovanni and Clara, owners of La Calabria, who are both so passionate about it too. Skip the chains and support our own local 5-star \"diamond ristorante italiano.\""}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've ever had, owners are very friendly. The food is very fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!! The owner grabbed the arm of and SCREAMED at our waiter and \"made an example\" out of him because I thought there was too much dressing on the salad.....WHAT THE HECK!!! I was physically terrified because the owner was so close that I thought he might assault me like he did his employee. The wife/owner apologized for her husband's violent aggressive outburst and horrific punishment of the employee while we were trying to eat. Honestly, I'm afraid what happened to that poor boy serving us our lunch after we left. So I guess my advice is that if you happen to choose to go to this place and you don't like how your food tastes, DO NOT COMPLAIN or some employee may be hurt/humiliated and/or fired."}
{"text":"Good size dinner salad that comes with your entree.  Big portions.  Delicious food."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave them 2 stars (see last paragraph) is that my children loved their food. We arrived at the restaurant and about half of the tables were full. We were seated and given water within 10 minutes. We waited another 15 minutes to place our drink order. The waiter was rude and condescending to my 11-year old daughter when she asked what the Italian soda tasted like. His reply? \"It tastes like Italian soda, what do you think?\" Then asked if that's what she wanted.  When my husband asked for ranch dressing on his salad he says \"all the kids want ranch nowadays.\" My husband is 37.   After waiting another 15 minutes to order food, my husband and I each ordered a different special. My iced tea was empty at this point and remained that way until we left.   I watched as a table that had just ordered received their food, which was exactly what we ordered. Only when the man complained that his food was wrong did our waiter apologize to THEM for giving them another tables food, ours.  They rushed his correct plate, while after 35 minutes we were still waiting. No apologies, we had to ask to be brought bread that every other table was given upon sitting. 3 tables were seated and done while we sat there. Far too expensive to ever go back again. Food was tasteless and bland. So disappointed I'm changing my rating to one star."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian place. Food is authentic and fresh.  Excellent menu with even better specials. Vast wine selection to match the food. They wine dinner nights are a great way to enjoy time with friends and family over a multi course meal."}
{"text":"Went with my family last friday for the first time and the food was fantastic. I liked that it was casual and that you aren't rushed out.   I had the salmon, and it was scrumptious. I plan to go back because the true test will be the chicken marsala. One of my favourite italian foods and hard to find done well. Will post later.  Expect to sit back and relax, because the service is slower. I like that pace so it's not a negative. Have a glass of wine and enjoy the simplicity of the place."}
{"text":"Once we were seated, service was good. The restaurant was a little warm though. The food was just ... okay. The calamari was cooked well but so bland - no salt or spice at all. There is the marinara but I shouldn't have to drown my food in sauce for flavor. We had the Gorgonzola Chicken and Frutti DiMare. The chicken was two thin cutlets that maybe were poached and in the cheese sauce and served with green and yellow squash. It tasted fine, but reminded me of what you would be served at a wedding. Kinda boring. I got a side of pasta with Vodka sauce. That pasta did not taste homemade to me, but what do I know? The Frutti Di Mare was also just okay. Again - the food isn't bad, just very underwhelming when you spend $90 for two. Maybe it's what we chose from the menu - because I really can't believe these 5 star reviews for the meal we had. Still, I wish them well and lots of people seem to like it - but we won't be back."}
{"text":"It was OK, not 4 stars.  Authentic Italian to me is walking in the door and being overwhelmed by the smell of garlic, fresh baked Italian bread and hearing Italian music being played softly throughout the establishment.  I've had the $30.00, family style, 5 course meal at Maggiano's that blew this place away.  Our meal was over $ 100 at La Calabria. (including tip)  I am an Italian from the East Coast, so I am a snob when it comes to Italian food.  I did LOVE the ricotta pie we had for dessert and they do make an excellent cappuccino.  Some suggestions for La Calabria... dimmer lighting, maybe a candle on the table for a little ambience, lower prices and a more cheerful wait staff."}
{"text":"I love La Calabria.  It is a locally owned restaurant and right away that is a nice change from the chain food haven we live in here in AZ.  La Calabria's head chef is actually the owner who was born and raised in Italy so you can't get more authentic than that.  The owners are very friendly and they will remember you if you take the time to talk to them.   The ambiance is simple and reminds me of a lot of restaurants I was raised on on the East Coast.  The sauce is just the way I like and that is not an easy task as I somewhat consider myself an Italian food snob.  I love the Veal Parmigiana as it, again, is just what I am used to.    In this day of chain restaurants, it is nice to see a mom and pop establishment make it through.  I hope they will be around for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Wonderful place i went there with my brother and friend and his wife and daughter. Service was great and food was wonderful. We shared the Fried Calamari and I had the Penne Alla vodka and a Cannoli.  I will be coming back for sure. Waitress was one of the owners she was very friendly and is from NY so it was great knowing a fellow Ny'er owned it, the bus boy was on point when our drinks were almost done he was there with a new one and refilled  our bread as soon as it was requested. TY to my friend Rob for this suggestion."}
{"text":"Wow, came with friends for the first time and we will be back with husbands.   Amazing flavors, great portions, friendly staff.   Wish I took pictures before but this is all that's left"}
{"text":"33 months ago we celebrated my birthday with dinner at La Calabria's previous location.  Our visit, and the meal were memorable, romantic and beyond delicious!  So I thought, why not go back for our 39th wedding anniversary; perhaps a fatal mistake!  This new location is rather stark and noisy due to no carpeting, curtains or soft wall hangings, just paper posters, and an open kitchen.  There were cloth tablecloths that helped a bit.  When I called for a reservation I told the hostess that it was our anniversary.  Apparently this was overlooked.  For my birthday they sang to us and presented a slice of delicious chocatate cake with lit candle!  For our anniversary, it was completely ignored.  We ordered the exact same meal expecting the exact same wonderful result.  Not this time.  The Calamari Friti was pale, had an \"off\" taste and was chewy and obviously not fried enough.  The accompanying maranara sauce needed lemon and salt to give it some flavor.  My Chicken Amalfitano (Chicken breast topped with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, red wine, demi glace, fresh mushrooms and fresh herbs with a side of steamed broccoli, and potatoes).  The veggies were very good, the sauce as well, but the chicken was overcooked.  I guess that averaged out with the calamari.  My wife's Salmone Livornese, covered with red onions, capers, and olives with plum tomatoes, and accompanied by the same wonderful veggies, was perfect.  It was a very large and thick chunk of ocean fresh, perfectly cooked, moist, nary a bone, fat or piece of skin present salmon.We had a little bowl of pasta with the same tastless marinara sauce.  Neither one of us finished it.  Her iced tea was excellent.  For dessert we split a creme brulee, average at best.  The old place was behind a discount tire shop but certainly delivered a fab meal.  We were sorry we didn't eat elsewhere!"}
{"text":"A little piece of Italy hidden in Gilbert, AZ! Thank you YELP for helping us find this delight of a restaurant.  People say things like \"best food I ever ate\" and I never thought I would be using such a trite expression.  But here it is, dish after dish served with greatness, flavorful, clean and fresh, made by a kitchen master!  Were the portions small? NONE were!  Was the food presented attractively?  YES, like a master's painting!  Was the food cooked properly?  Fresh where it needed to be, tender, never overcooked! We started our meal in this attractive two dozen table restaurant with Mom out front and Pop cooking in the back, with Calamari Fritti, abundant, fabulous taste, crunchy and tender, accompanied with a Marinara Sauce that would be great on any pasta!  Next a Caesar Salad, followed by Chicken Amalfitano (Chicken breast topped with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, red wine, demi glace, fresh mushrooms and fresh herbs) with a side of steamed broccoli with a hint of garlic.  Salmone Livornese,  covered with red onions, capers, and olives with plum tomatoes, and accompanied by the same wonderful broccoli.  A very large and thick chunk of ocean fresh, perfectly cooked, moist, nary a bone, fat or piece of skin present salmon.  We hummed as we ate if you know what I mean.  At the end I was brought a lovely slice of chocolate cake with a lit birthday candle in it and a few staff members sang Happy Birthday to me.   I want to mention that I lived in Italy for ten years and La Calabria Ristorante took me back to the best of the best!!!  As my wife proclaimed, \"this is my new favorite restaurant.\"  Don't miss out just because it's hidden behind a Discount Tire shop in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Always great food. Small intimate authentic restaurant. If you want Olive Garden, go there. If you want real Italian food, this is your place. Friendly, personal service. Like eating with family!  I go every week."}
{"text":"Tonight was a night to celebrate.  We knew we wanted two things something new and something pasta.  Giovanni and Clara were welcoming and hospitable.  We had the Fettuchini la Calabria and a request to make something with sausage and vodka sauce.  The meal that appeared before me was beyond what I expected.  Delicious was a mild description.  Clara also selected a wonderful Chianti that complimented the meal perfectly.  This meal was so tasty that I couldn't stop.  Clara and Giovanni talked with us and share their story with us and us with them.  They made our experience tonight one we will remember with nice conversation and a great dinner.  We will return to La Calabria Ristorante soon to our new friends.  Thank you Giovanni and Clara."}
{"text":"Excellent food and personal service. A great value as well, you can't get fresh, homemade Italian food at a better price. Everything we have tried so far is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Heard some great things about this place from a couple of friends. Thought I'd give it a try. I was a little disappointed. The food wasn't disgusting but it wasn't too notch either. We started with the Calamari. The squid was decent, a little rubbery. What surprised me was the lack of seasoning. The batter although flaky was bland. The marinara sauce was also bland. It tasted like it was a can of crushed tomato, heated with some fresh basil. And that's it. Also ordered a couple of entrees. My wife ordered the fettuccini with shrimp and prosciutto. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. I will share that the homemade pasta was great. Cooked al dente and was solid. My wife's dish was bland. It lacked seasoning and the robust flavors you would expect from an Italian restaurant. My spaghetti and meatballs were the same. The meatballs were cooked perfectly but lacked any depth. It was like a ball of beef roasted in a pan. No garlic, no salt, no pepper, no basil. The sauce was the same they used for the Calamari dip. Bland. I know I have used that word quite a bit but it ultimately sums up my experience.  I wouldn't go back and I don't recommend. What a shame, it had great potential!"}
{"text":"Amazing homemade Italian food!!! House made pasta! Best Italian food we've found since moving here 5 years ago!!! Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"First time visit tonight. We moved to area about a year ago, been searching for our neighborhood Italian joint and finally found it! Great food (I had the Vongole in white sauce, he had the lasagna). Loved both. Very friendly service. Traditional ricotta cheesecake, made on the premises was absolutely the best. If you haven't been, you just must!"}
{"text":"**UPDATE**          Yes La Calabria!!! This is what I've been missing! Gladly came back in for a second visit today and so happy that I did. Yes, it's not the prettiest restaurant in the world but we're there to eat not stare at the decor, right? I'd eat food like this in a dark alley if I had to. So, honestly can't complain.      We started with the calamari appetizer. It was lightly breaded and complemented the marinara sauce perfectly. Most places bring you a tiny plate of calamari but not here... La Calabria brings you a gigantic bowl full of fried delicious goodness. So worth it and absolutely recommend.     I'm a sucker for tortellini and their cream sauce is divine so you best believe I ordered it the second time. Although, I really want to muster the courage to order the lobster ravioli because it looks amazing. But always, always, save room for dessert. We ordered the limoncello cake and I wish I didn't get it to share... It was outstanding! If you love simple, elegant Italian food, come here!        When I heard La Calabria reopened I was overjoyed!Finally came into their new location recently with high hopes. This location doesn't seem to have as much heart in it as their first. The decor is hung up posters and the restaurant is awkwardly silent, with the only noise coming from the banging of pots & pans in the kitchen. Some music and improved ambiance would really lighten the mood.     We started off our meal with clams in a white sauce. It was very bland and tasted more like chicken broth than anything else. But the sourdough bread they provided made it a little better. I'd probably skip that next visit though. The menu had lots of fascinating drink selections but unfortunately we weren't able to try anything because they didn't have a bartender that night. Our entree was the meat tortellini panna & prosciutto, which I HIGHLY recommend! It is what made me fall in love with this place & taste just how I remember.     In conclusion, I'll without a doubt be back. Everyone has off days and Calabria may need a little more time to find that passion again. A little decor, music and being able to offer take out would be an amazing improvement. Hopefully I'll get to update this review with better results soon."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Housemade Lasagna*Made with Bolognese and Besciamella  The owners are friendly."}
{"text":"The dinner special delicious. I highly recommend this place.  From the owners: Most of you know that we are at the end of our lease as of September 30th.  We have been negotiating to stay for some time now, but without success.  As of this writing, we have had no offer extended.  After 7 years of being a \"Hidden Gem\" at 1534 E Ray Road, Gilbert, AZ.. the doors of La Calabria will be closed.  BUT... We have \"something cooking\"! ***** WATCH FOR EMAIL UPDATES *****   SO.... We are NOT saying Good-Bye...  We ARE saying \"Till We Meet Again\"!  Please save your gift certificates for the new location!  Stay Hungry! Clara & Giovanni     480-726-3537"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last Saturday. The place is clean and friendly but the decor and ambiance could use a little more attention. The wait staff were very good and did a nice job. Started off ordering an iced tea, but they were out. Evidently something happened while brewing it or it spilled....can't remember the exact answer but they were out. We ordered wine and it was good, but I could have used a nice dose of tea as well. We ordered the calamari for our appetizer and it looked like average run of the mill, standard calamari but it was cooked to perfection!! Crisp and hot crust and the interior was hot but tender! No chewy, rubbery pieces to be found. I've tried a lot of calamari and this is the best job on cooking this dish hands down. Should have left the chef a compliment for that one. Our main courses were the pasta with vodka sauce and a chicken dish with cheese? I can't recall the name of the chicken dish but that pretty much explains that dish, to me. It was good but not so spectacular that it was memorable but the pasta was another hit. The pasta was delicious and the vodka sauce was even better. I will be back for the calamari and the pasta. Definitely good food, not fancy and very nice staff."}
{"text":"A friend and I dined at La Calabria yesterday for the first time.  It certainly will not be our last!  The food and service were absolutely first rate.  Our server, Kayla, was very knowledgeable about the menu and the evening's specials, and she was able to answer any and all of our questions.  Kayla was professional, friendly and very efficient -- excellent server.  We started with the special appetizer of fresh asparagus wrapped in prosciutto, lightly breaded and sauteed.  The asparagus was cooked to perfection, still slightly crunchy and very flavorful.  It was the perfect start to a totally delicious meal.  I had the lobster ravioli which was out of this world perfection.  The ravioli were topped with 2 sea scallops, cooked just right to avoid tough/rubbery texture, and a shrimp.  The sauce was very rich but at the same time very light.  The whole dish was outstanding.  My friend had the veal chop special.  It was cooked perfectly and had delicious flavor.  Like the ravioli dish, the portion as very generous.  Half the veal chop went home with my friend to make a perfect 2nd meal today.  I am not giving La Calabria 5 stars because the decor/atmosphere is a little bare bones for me.  This is a minor quibble, and it should be noted that the excellent food and service compensate for the plain decor."}
{"text":"Little ambiance (if any) and pricing that is definitely $$+, but the food is not pretentious, is prepared well and tastes excellent.  This is not an over-the-top sauce type of place like a chain Italian, rather a small family run business (which I like), that prepares excellent tasting meals...  If you're looking for the combination of a nice date night ambiance with some romance potential, then this is not going to do the trick, but if you want a very nice meal with excellent flavor from people who love to cook, then this is a great option..."}
{"text":"Food = delicious Ambiance = meh Service = meh Value = meh  Started with the arancini (Italian rice balls) - this was our first time and they were delicious.  For the main course we each got the veal (the lady got the picatta - which was served with capers and a heap o' brocolli, I got the parmesan, which was yum-tastic and served with penne and their fresh marinara).  The ambiance felt a little tacky - with the exception of some very unique posters advertising some of their specials and promotions.  The service started off okay, a nice older gentleman who had the coolest Italian accent.  More than a couple times we went thirsty with empty glasses, but the weirdest part came at the end of the night.  When you dine with other couples, it's not out of the ordinary for said couples to pay individually.  This only becomes a problem when the bill comes hand-written and the waiter can't read his own chicken scratch.  It's not good to end the evening making the customer feel like they're putting you out trying to separate things.  So a few drinks, an appetizer and two main courses came to $80 with tip - it's just a shame that it ended on a somewhat sour note."}
{"text":"First time going & the food was great it made me feel like I was back in my Nonie's kitchen and at home. The hospitality made it feel even more special & welcoming.  The House made Cheese Cake with Strawberry Drizzle was really great finish to a wonderful dinner.  I would definitely go there again, and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great Italian Restaurant to bring the family to, and they even have a Kids menu!!  I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place on New Year's Eve, with no reservations, nonetheless. We originally headed to a chain but decided not to wait the 1 hour and 45 minute wait time. I had read a review in a local paper that day so we decided to give it a try.   The place is in a little strip mall and is a little hard to find. The staff was pleasant and apologized for not being able to get us in right away (we waited about 5-7 minutes). The ambiance isn't anything great and the tables were pretty close together. (Hence the 4 starts not 5).   But let me tell you about the food.... mmmmmm.....  I'll preface by saying I'm Italian. And Italian food is by far my favorite. I ordered the lasagna. The sauce was magnificent. I could have eaten an entire additional portion, it was that good. My husband had some type of penne dish in a wine sauce. Equally as good. The house wine was also very good.   But let me tell you about the dessert. OMG. I have never been a huge tiramisu fan but read that it was good so we tried it. I have been dreaming about it ever since. I could eat a 9x13 pan for breakfast- every day it was that good. A little too much cocoa on top, but otherwise heavenly. We also had the cheesecake, which was also amazing.  If you are looking for great food, but maybe not a romantic atmosphere, you have to try this place."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of the finest restaurant there is. Everything is freshly prepared and served to perfection. The staff is friendly and competent. Never have been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Thank you for a wonderful dining experience. We were sincerely greeted upon entering. The staff was so nice and answered all questions. Everything sounded so delicious, it was difficult to make a choice. The food was amazing. Will most definitely be returning. Thanks for not overpricing the entrees."}
{"text":"Caprese 'special' app - I make a better one at home...too much olive oil and no flavor.   Calamari - bland and boring   Fruti De Mari - big fat messy clump   That's $140 and two hours of my life I'll never get back...   Tortolinni w meat did have an amazing sauce... very rich"}
{"text":"I love this hidden gem located on the NW corner of Val Vista and Ray. It's a family owned business who make everything from scratch. If you like simple yet sophisticated without a lot of fanfare, this is your place.  Garlic lovers unite!  Occasionally I consider trying different Italian restaurants but decide it's not worth the financial risk.  La Calabria always impresses and the daily specials keep the delicious variety flowing!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant with friends to celebrate my birthday. The food was amazing!  From the arancini, to the calamari the appetizers were great.  The pasta is made fresh and you can certainly tell. I'll definitely go back again and it was worth the drive from Phoenix. Make sure and make reservations because this place is busy because the food is so good."}
{"text":"Prompt service when we arrived about 5 on a Thursday. Our food experience was ok, not memorable; it was served hot. Extra fee for Gluten free penne and meal splitting. Poster decor from past wine dinners (with date, no year) prompted us to ask about future events but none are planned."}
{"text":"We don't go out for Italian very often, my wife isn't usually a fan. We were looking for somewhere near our place to grab a bite after a long weekend road trip. We decided to try la Calabria. We weren't disappointed. The authentic food was amazing and the service was impeccable. You can definitely sense that it is family owned and operated. My wife said that her Seafood ravioli was the best pasta she's ever had. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the staff was friendly. It was one of those nights that we were out with the kids and didn't know what was for dinner. The man decided he wanted Italian and that we were going here.   We arrived about 45 minutes before close and the place was pretty empty. It was also a surprise that this spot is located in the strip mall. Each of the kids ordered from the kids menu, chicken strips and fries.... they make the \"strips\" themselves, they've got to because they're more like battered chicken breasts. Much better quality than any of us were expecting. I got one of the specials, a gorgonzola, sausage and pepperoncinis pasta. It was creamy and delicious. The man got a veal dish (poor baby cow) which he absolutely loved.   I will say, I found it to be a bit pricey. Though it wasn't my choice and I wasn't paying so I really shouldn't complain. The food was definitely good quality and since it's a local spot we want to support it. I think it would be worth checking out again earlier in the eve just to see if there are any differences."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service.   I'll just add that anyone visiting a restaurant during their first week in business needs to relax and enjoy the company of their dinner date and not get too bent out of shape on service.   La Calabria rocks. Period."}
{"text":"Just visited again tonight.  This has been on our rotation of restaurants for a while, but it's a 25+ minute drive for us, so we don't get there as often as we'd like.  Tonight was the first time I think I ordered from the regular menu.  Chicken with eggplant, red pepper, mozzarella, peas and artichokes.  Delicious!  And huge - even enough for take home and lunch tomorrow.    I had the side of Penne with Vodka sauce.  While it was a bit heavy, I loved the creamy texture bursting with cheese flavor.  The tiramisu continues to impress for dessert.  I love this place, but I'm afraid it doesn't get the visits it needs to survive.  If you like local, family owned restaurants, check this place out.  Great good, reasonable wines prices and a friendly, Italian-born chef that visits every table.  Classic old school.    Avoid the chains and check this place out.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"After convincing my wife and kids to go out to dinner on Mother's Day, the question became \"where?\"  After reading reviews on Yelp, we decided to try La Calabria Ristorante.  I am not allowed to pick restaurants anymore.  The food was mediocre and bland.   Salads were a 1/4 cup of iceberg lettuce with paper thin slices of carrots and radishes.   The fillet wrapped in puff pastry crust was tender, but overpowered by the mushroom sauce/gravy.  The broccoli was mush and very bland.  My wife had the seafood linguine which was simply \"ok.\" the same for my daughter's ricotta stuffed gnocchi, just \"ok.\"    Desserts were decent with the exception of the tiramisu and cheesecake, both lackluster.  The cheesecake was not creamy or smooth, just grainy.  The flourless cake was good, wish we all ordered that.    Service was fair considering it was Mother's Day, but another server or two could not have hurt.  They do serve alcohol, but there is not a bartender on staff.  If it comes out of a bottle, you are good, otherwise, think \"flask\"  :)  So much for a lemon-drop martini.  Perhaps being from Chicago and growing up in northern Italy, I am too critical, but not our \"go-to\" choice for Italian."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in the valley. BEST Italian food I have had anywhere outside of Italy, and even better than most in Italy. We were frequent customers of La Calabria prior to the temporary closure and move to the new location. We kept checking the web to see when the reopening would occur (seriously jonesing for Giovanni's fresh made pasta). The food is fabulous! My personal favorite is the squid ink tagliolini ai frutti di mare with a lobster tail - BEYOND DELICIOUS! The grana e pere antipasti is great as is the limoncello cake, frankly everything on the menu is awesome! Portion sizes are perfect - we always take home leftovers. Besides the wonderful food Giovanni and Clara are very friendly and just lovely people. We are so excited to have our favorite Italian restaurant back in business."}
{"text":"Bland food, okay service, lack luster ambiance and generic wine. Nothing special enough to make me want to return. Those who rated this place a 5, must have grown up eating Spaghetti-O's."}
{"text":"BEST ITALIAN FOOD IN THE VALLEY! I am a frequent diner and have never been disappointed. Whatever is on special that night is always incredible. I'm from New York, and I've been to Italy, and this food is definitely comparable."}
{"text":"Our first time at this place and we were more than satisfied.  I will agree that the setup and decor is lackluster. However, the service we received and the meals for our party 4 were great!  The prices are what you'd expect for freshly made pasta and sauces."}
{"text":"I went there last night and I ordered the calamari. It had no taste and was very expensive. And the service was not very good. I will not be back"}
{"text":"Visited this place at 6 pm on Friday night.  I was expecting more people, but almost half tables were empty.  This has NOTHING to do with the food, it's just a hidden location.  The food was EXCELLENT.  We had a daily special pasta with seafood, and tiramisu for dessert.  I was very very impressed with both dishes.  This is definitely my favorite place now."}
{"text":"Let me qualify this rating by saying the food was five stars! Great sauce and everyone enjoyed their meal. The only reason I gave three stars was the service. We were halfway through our meal when a bus boy asked if he could package the rest up for us. We were asked if we wanted desert and before we could make a decision she was back with our checks. We did ask to speak to a manager and along with praising the food we commented on how being hurried hurt our dining experience. We were told the wait staff is expected to do that. I will return but will make it clear that I don't expect to be rushed. Yes, the food was that good!"}
{"text":"We were recommended this restaurant from a regular customer. My wife and I went hoping it would be ok! This is a Great Real Italian restaurant! The owner waited on us and our food came fast and fresh. Great sauces. I will return. Kind of hard to find so google it and you will find it. The recipes are really from Italy. Lasagna was very different but good! Chicken Marsala hard the best sauce I had. The cheese cake and strawberry sauce!!! Made from Ricotta and really perfectly sweet. The sauces are the best and mostly different. Try it, great food and service."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon La Calabria Ristorante last month and unfortunately, it was a Monday (closed on Mondays). Lo & behold, once again when we thought of going there last week, it was on another Monday. FINALLY last night, we made it there and SO GLAD we did! The staff was professional and very attentive, yet very friendly & fun as well! The cook even came out and chatted with us and answered questions we had on the menu. The food? No words, other than \"Hands down, THE BEST Italian food we've ever had!\" The deserts? TO DIE FOR! Prices? Excellent. We will be back soon and will be telling our friends & family!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from a few people...all who loved it. I didn't want to review it after my first dinner there because I was sure it was a fluke. After the second visit I realized there wouldn't be a third visit.  The first time they were short handed in the kitchen. The food took a long time. But it was good, the risotto- fantastic. Also, the service was okay...nothing spectacular but not the worst I've had.  The second time they were short handed in the front of house. The service was appalling. My water only refilled once...we could never catch our server to get another glass of wine. Only 1 employee...a busboy...showed any desire to be at work. At one point the hostess was chatting with the people at the next table and then showed off her newest tattoo on the shoulder blade. The food was mediocre. Oh and the fabulous risotto? It is only offered with the special.  Oh and don't plan on spending less than 2.5 hours for dinner with no dessert."}
{"text":"My parents are from italy and we take them every time they come to AZ.  The food is from their province in Italy and they love it!  In fact, my parents will not eat at Italian restaraunts normally because they are usually disappointed - not here.  We are going tonight!"}
{"text":"Top quality Italian food in a restaurant with one owner as chef and the other running the dining room. It's no accident this place has plenty of business. My wife had eaten there several times and had great things to say so for Mother's Day Eve, we struck and it was all she had said. The house Fettucini Calabria was delightful. Our guest got a seafood medley over 'bata?' noodles that was superb. The difference in seafood cooked by someone who knows what they are doing compared with the usual fare most places is pretty amazing. Clare, the hostess, told us they go out of their way to obtain fresh seafood. Maybe that is the difference.  I'll go out on a limb here and propose that the item that maybe best typifies this restaurant is their signature martini - I think called a Calabratini. Raspberry liquor and shaved chocolate in the bottom of the glass and then vanilla vodka, Irish Creme, and espresso poured from a height out of ice cold metal shakers. Hello. I am a bit of a martini snob. And not really much of a sweet drinks guy. This martini is like a martini candy bar seducing a throbbing young nubile virgin. Slides down like a sneaking Don Juan and then 'Pow. Hello there different world.' Drivers: I'd suggest only one.  If you want to see how to run a restaurant right, check out La Calabria Ristorante. We'll be back. More than once. Enjoy."}
{"text":"What a cute place! We came in here for dinner and were pleasantly surprised! This is a definite family feeling environment, the service was really friendly and welcoming. We had told the hostess (who I think is part owner) that it was our first time and she came over a few times throughout our dinner to ask how everything was and offer suggestions. She also provided us with free drinks on the house to end our superb meal.  The Balsamic Chicken is AMAZING and the Pear Salad was a little piece of fresh heaven. Great combination of flavors and dressing.  You will definitely enjoy a visit here...slightly overpriced, but the service and environment make up for all of that!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations based on the reviews. Unfortunately, we were not impressed at all with the food or the service.  The appetizer was good (crepes with mushrooms and pancetta), the bread was hard and had no flavor, the chicken marsala tasted like cheap frozen chicken breasts with and the sauce was sweet and had a maple syrup taste to it. Yuck! The rigatoni with vodka sauce had a very good sauce, but the rigatoni was not homemade and it was too firm. The tiramisu was excellent. Oh, also no brewed iced tea, just the fountain stuff. Very disappointed :("}
{"text":"Dinner plans changed the night before my family was to leave town after my graduation. It was a Saturday night at 6pm and we suddenly didn't have dinner plans.   I did a quick survey and found that everyone wanted Italian. A quick google search led me to La Calabria - a place I had neither heard of or dined at before. I checked Yelp and the reviews were good so on we went - sans reservations - to try something new.   I must say that both my wife and step-mom wanted to go to Olive Garden but I just hate chains and was willing to chance a great meal over a mediocre one I could trust. I'm glad I pressed on!  The service was excellent, almost as good as the food which was spectacular. The setting wasn't exactly what I'd imagine with such great service and food. They would really be helped by being in a fancier building. Being in a strip-mall must certainly limit their patrons but I guess that doesn't matter because the place was packed by what looked and sounded like a strong group of regulars. Always a good sign - when the owner comes around and is clearly greeted by people he has met before.   Will we go back? Of course! Everything was absolutely great. Some of the highlights:  1. They brought my 5 year old son's meal out first so he could get started. They obviously know a 5 year old eats slowly. He said it was the best chicken fingers he has ever had (of course he says that a lot).   2. We asked how big the portions were and were told they were size-able. My wife and I ended up splitting a meal and are glad we did. They give us each a full sized dinner salad and to be honest the plates we got each looked like full sized meals.   3. The wine they recommended was excellent and a perfect fit for our group.   4. When the server found out we were celebrating my graduation the restaurant bought us a round of sambuca shots and me a free desert. What a great touch!   5. The owner greeted us personally twice and chatted with us for a few minutes.   6. The after-dinner cappachino was just like I remember from Italy! perfecto!"}
{"text":"Great service. Family atmosphere. Authentic. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying, I give this restaurant five stars for their outstanding food. The food tastes so fresh, delicious and is well executed. Their sauces are wonderful! I grew up in a big Italian family and my parents owned a restaurant for 25 years. Here's my issue with this restaurant: the ambiance is dreadful. There is no feeling of a homey, cozy, warm atmosphere, which is akin with the Italian culture. Instead, you are met with a cold and sterile environment. My husband and I went for dinner and we felt like we were in the hospital cafeteria. Lights too bright, nothing intimate or artful on the walls. That being said, we will return for take-out, but hope that the owners read this review, from one Italian to another, and implement some atmosphere change. Thanks for the great food! Yum!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings. .. staff awesome. .. decor clean but odd... food was great but... my caprese salad (9$) had 5 wedges but only 2 basil leaves... and no balsamic... then my awesome veal sorrentino layered with eggplant and cheese ($22) was served with raw broccoli. .. it was so good I'll be back just not sure why it wasn't better"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Italian food. They also do occasional wine dinners, which are fantastic and a lot of fun. The owners take the time to check on customers and stop by the table to chat. The food reminds me of Sunday dinners with my Italian grandmother!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a place like this since moving to the east side several years ago. Excellent homemade Italian food from an authentic family owned restaurant. They make you feel like family.   The people who complain about the wait on their food have clearly never been outside the chain restaurants. Quality Italian food, or any food for that matter, takes time.  Stuffed mushrooms were good, the lobster ravioli was amazing and the cheesecake and tiramisu is some if the best."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Met both the husband and wife team. Very friendly. The food was good, and the service was great. I will eat there again."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!  The wait staff were each so unique and very doting. Each of us ordered from the specials because we couldn't see beyond that. Wonderful cioppino with halibut. To die for!!!!  Excellent wine choices. The restaurant filled up quickly on a Friday evening. Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Food was nothing to get excited about. I personally make way better marinara sauce than what I was served. The kid's pasta tasted like it was dumped right out of a can. My linguine rusticana had good garlic flavor and the portabella mushrooms were tasty, but it was just average. My husband had the veal parmesan and said he would not get it again. The bread before the meal was dry and cold.  It was pricey. The wait staff was patient with our kiddos, thank you! Overall I would most likely not return as I was not blown away by the value, taste, or atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that this '5' Star rating is mainly because of their crazy amazing food!  Their pasta is made on-site and you can tell it's FRESH!  This restaurant has climbed to the top of my favorite Italian restaurant list.   I must say that the quality of food doesn't 'match' the ambiance.  I believe this is a family owned restaurant but I'm telling you their food outdoes many of the boujee italian restaurants in the East Valley, maybe all of Phoenix.  The decor is simple, and the service is not bad, yet not spectacular.  Once again, because of the bomb.com food, I'm giving them a pass on the service.    My youngest daughter absolutely loves it here and I'll be introducing it to the rest of the family soon. Prices are a little steep but because of the freshness and taste, I personally would pay it, no problem."}
{"text":"I really like this place, good food and friendly staff. Everything i tryed  i enjoyed.   Its  nice to have a family run Italian  restaurant  close by.  Loved the atmosphere.   I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"The meal was delicious! I got chicken Marsala and it was hands down THE best chicken Marsala I have ever had! It had the nuttiest flavor! We also had a bottle of the Puccini Chianti. It was excellent. My husband had the special of the night a prosciutto stuffed chicken dish. It was also excellent! The bread was wonderful. Not a fan of the ice burg lettuce salad but everything else was on point!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. It is the kind of mom and pop place you find in Jersey.  the chef, Giovanni, comes from Italy and his food is what i grew up with as a kid.  The opening salad is simple but I really enjoy his fresh made dressing.  My favorite is the Zupa de Pesce especially when I can get it with his Black Pasta.  We have eaten here many times and the specials are usually the way to go as they are inspired by the fresh ingredients he gets.  His wife, Clara (and the hostess), makes this awesome cheesecake that is light and delicious.  Always a good meal."}
{"text":"Best Italian in AZ! Great low key family environment. Perfect of a date or family night!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday afternoon since it's right next to our house and we've always see it when we shop next door at sprouts.   So first off when we walked in there was four people at the bar and two tables of people... so not busy at all... and the hostess was busy doing something that didn't seemed like she needed to be doing since they were not busy at all lol and we stood for about two minutes and finally the Chef (possibly owner?) told her to come seat us. Since we had so much time when we walked we tried to read the specials board but couldn't read the poor handwriting.   Once we got sat I tried to ask the hostess what the specials were since we couldn't read them and she just grimly replied that the server would explain. Server came and explained everything she was decent at her job.   We didn't know they serve bread and when it came out it was cold :( we ordered this cheese appetizer that said it was bread and cheese and it came out as pretty much flavor less fried cheese, highly disappointing and bland.  Ordered shrimp pasta in white wine and lasagna and it came with house salad. They had blue cheese and ranch but no Italian dressing? That was off for an Italian restaurant. Salad came and it was bland as well, only thing that had flavor so far was the olive :(  At this point the only saving grace can be the main course and they both disappointed. The lasagna was decent but not a saving grace :( the shrimp pasta was also bland.   PS during our time there three groups came in and left before they ordered  Overall we came and we tried it and we wouldn't be back unless they made some pretty drastic changes"}
{"text":"Easily best Italian food in 70 mile radius.    Absolutely one of my favorites.  It is very unassuming from the outside as its in a strip mall behind Discount Tire, but it packs a punch.  Its a small local business the wife is one of the servers and is the sweetest lady ever.  I have been here a few times and the service is always excellent.    For the food:  it is pricey so it's not an every day place, but worth the splurge on a date night or special occasion.  Everything taste fresh with high quality ingredients.  The dinner specials are always different and well put together to fuse food, flavor, and overall dining experience.  Please start off with the mussels with white sauce. They are some of the best I've ever had.  As soon as you taste the pasta you can tell its cooked Al Dente which is so much better. .    I encourage everyone to go here to not only support a local business, but to experience excellent cuisine."}
{"text":"Hidden away but worth the effort to find it. Service was excellent and the food was above average."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to return after 6+ years away.  Found their new location.  Was SOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed they no longer served their wonderful bread dipping oil.  It was fabulous and filled with fresh herbs.  Now -- just a pat of butter - so not original.  My friend ordered a gin and tonic and the tonic was flat!.  Waitress checked to make sure tonic wasn't empty from gun and said it was set to flat!  Who servers a carbonated drink flat???  Food was bland.  No staff seemed to be smiling.   The owners are a husband/wife team.  He does the kitchen and she the dining room.  When leaving talked to the husband about the flat tonic.  He said he doesn't drink tonic and has no idea.  Then told him the food was rather bland and he said he had someone new in kitchen. The man didn't seem to care at all about my concerns. We should have left after we found out they now just serve butter with bread!!!  Will NOT return."}
{"text":"Decor was minimal. Service non-existant, they ran out of butter for the chewy bread, the 'waiter' finally took our order and forgot the extra dressing and came by once. Food was very bland.... dont waste your time"}
{"text":"Probably the best chicken Marsala ever.....cute little place... awesome food!  The specials aren't on the menu and the lights were a little bright.  By far the best Italian restaurant in Gilbert...."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. While the ambience was not what we expected, it was quite charming and very welcoming. Dinner was amazing. I had the tortellini and my boyfriend had a seafood pasta. The portions were very very good sized, especially for the money.  The food was amazing. The service was great. Well worth the visit! We also had the best dessert...possibly the best dessert I have ever had. Apparently it was their special and sadly not regularly offered on the menu. It was their flourless hazelnut dessert and if you go and they offer it...you MUST try it. I will covet it in my mind for times to come..."}
{"text":"how did the best Italian food in Arizona end up deep in Gilbert? Growing up as an Italian-American in New York, I know my Italian food. This place is superb. The owners, husband as the chef, wife as the m'aitre d, keep it simple and focused on the food. The Frutti Di Mare is the best I've had since grandmas kitchen. Thank you for an unexpectedly positive experience!"}
{"text":"La Calabria is very unassuming, modest and no frills in its outward appearance so we were completely surprised by the incredible food and service.  Kayla, our server was so professional and knowledgeable and rattled off quite a few daily specials with all the complicated ingredients all from memory.  We ordered one of the appetizer specials - fresh asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and parmesan - out of this world delicious!  Our main dishes were so expertly prepared and the sauces were so, so flavorful and rich without being heavy.  They have a good selection of cocktails and beer and wine.  The menu is pricy but worth every dollar!  Will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"Outstanding the butternut squash ravioli and grouper, clams and scallops simply the best meal we have had in quite awhile!!!!"}
{"text":"This family owned restaurant is very friendly but obviously \"family operated\"! It took several minutes for anyone to notice we were there, we were the only people in the restaurant & it took the waitress (owner I think) 10 min to get us menus, 10 min to take our drink order, and another 10 min to take our order. She was busy on her phone & computer the entire time we were there. The food took another 20 min & was not very good. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! It is so hard to find authentic and fantastic Italian food. I will admit it took us a couple drive-by's before we hit it up but now we will go all the time. It is really a special place. Take a date or your family and have a great time!"}
{"text":"I had an interesting experience here. After an exhausting week, I didn't want to do the drive down to Scottsdale so I decided to consult Yelp for a nice local dining experience for my 25th birthday dinner. I ended up finding this place and was also recommended it by my hair stylist. Perhaps I didn't do my research because the setting is not at all what I expected. I was excited to use this dinner as an opportunity to dress up and have a meal in a more formal setting for a reservation with 12 people. Mistake one. If this is your intention, do not come here. To be fair, they accommodated our group of 12 nicely but seemed a bit frustrated the entire time.   Ambiance-- pretty casual. Would not come here for any type of formal dinner. The pics are somewhat misleading of this place. They have formal fabric tablecloths but bright lighting that you'd expect in a restroom. Overall, just an unattractive place. I would recommend this place for a quick dinner or a casual outing with friends. It had an odd senior citizens center cafeteria-like setting. When I see a fancy pancy Italian restaurant name with fabric tablecloths in their photos, I expect it to be a little classy. Perhaps, this was presumptuous of me. To be clear, I wouldn't take even my grandparents here. Secondly, there was a gross grasshopper that either flew on the table or came out of my salad. Our table was farthest from the entrance door, which grossed me or 10x more. Now I understand this probably wasn't the restaurants fault but I didn't expect such nonchalance out of them. I mean I feel like they should've removed the grasshopper and gave me new silverware instead of just leaving the grasshopper to hop under my feet...Perhaps this is a normal occurrence for them.    Service- Now we were a large party and it was a Sat night so I can understand the stress...but the service was a bit wonky. Incident 1-the grasshopper moment. Incident 2- waiter was not happy about us splitting checks (now this is deff annoying of us but you said you could accommodate us on the phone when I called beforehand  so ya best deal with it nicely). Incident 3- the most awk manager vs customer experience I've encountered. So my friend didn't enjoy her dish as it was \"watery and flavorless\" I understand it stinks to hear a customer didn't relish your the meal at your establishment, but I don't think that should mean you embarrass her. Basically my friend expressed her disappointment in the meal and I think requested a new dish to the manager. The manager then proceeded to talk to her in a condescending manner, making pretty harsh statements. Ufffff, this was uncomfortable. Eventually, they didn't charge her for her meal and offered her a replacement meal but she was not happy about the encounter so she didn't order anything else. Incident 4- as the birthday girl, I was not aware of this or present for this but my friend asked the manager if they did anything special for birthdays. In other words, she was asking if they could get me a special treat with a lit candle. I feel this is a fairly normal request as I've done this at multiple restaurants before but once again, it was met with some uncomfortable remarks by the owner/manager.   Food- I got the chicken Marsala which was delicious! A photo of it is attached. As for the price, it was pretty standard but I feel like you could pay about the same at another restaurant with far better ambiance and an overall better dining experience.   By the way, there is a 5$ charge to share an entree. This isn't a big deal as I feel you could finish the entree by yourself....just maybe in two sittings. Pretty fair portion size.   Overall- I got a good meal out of it but had an overall disappointing dining experience. I guess it's just not what I anticipated nor what I wanted at all for my birthday dinner. Normally I wouldn't mind, but it's the one time off of school that I was able to enjoy some time with friends so this was just a total bummer. Guess I will have to head to Scottsdale next time for a better dining experience  :D"}
{"text":"Food gets 5 Stars. Service is definitely to be desired for. Do NOT go there unless you plan to spend a couple of hours there. The attentiveness of the staff is less than stellar at best. I went on a Friday night so was expecting it to be busy, but 2 hours is just plain ridiculous. Again, I have zero complaints about the food, I thought every dish we ordered was amazing, but not really a fair trade-off for that length of time. In addition, it was extremely hot inside the restaurant causing even more grief. I don't normally give poor reviews, but patrons need to be made aware of what they're getting themselves into when deciding to dine here."}
{"text":"Yay they are back. Didn't miss a beat. Clara and Giovanni recognized us and greeted us like family. Food was delicious!  Had the specials as usual- we don't even look at the menu."}
{"text":"I wanted to LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and be dying to come back, but i'm really not unfortunately. I must say, the food was better than Olive Garden, Carraba's, ect for sure. Got a seafood pasta dish with white/garlic sauce instead of the red. It was a tad watery and bland. I guess I just expected more flavor. The people are very nice that work there, but service is slow. They don't come back to often to see if you want another glass of wine, ect. The bill took quite a bit to get to us as well. We may come back, but i'm not counting the days to return."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and both my wife and I were very impressed.  I had the Cod, my wife the Ahi, both were cooked perfectly and the sauces augmented the flavor.  A little pricey but the food did not disappoint. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best Italian restaurant around!   Their marinara sauce is to die for!  Everything is made in house and you feel like your eating at your Italian grandmother's house.  Highly recommended, I'm so glad they have reopened."}
{"text":"The best Italian food ever!  We love this place.  The marinara sauce is incredible!  Everything tastes so fresh and home cooked.  We have always had good service.  One time I ordered mussels and they did not taste good at all.  The male owner saw that I wasn't eating them and asked me what was wrong.  When I told him the mussels tasted fishy and old he thanked me profusely for letting him know.  I've had the mussels prior to and after this one incident and they are excellent.   You can tell the minute you walk in the door that the owners take great pride in this restaurant.  I highly recommend this place if you want divine Italian food!"}
{"text":"Best. restaurant. ever.  I LOVE this place. I want to eat here every day.   Cheesecake is amazing.  Bolognese sauce is spectacular.  Mozzarella appetizer is so good."}
{"text":"Wonderful!  Grew up in New York, spent time in Italy and this is some of the best Italian cuisine you will ever taste."}
{"text":"Ok.. Am I prejudiced? Yes, I am. I believe that the best Italian food needs a little less commercial structure and a little more heart and soul.I know the Olive Garden chefs are all trained in Italy because I saw the commercial. PLEASE! Five minutes in the door at La Calabria and Giovanni pops out of the kitchen and he's ready to talk about what's best that night. Tonight it was Osso Buco over risotto. Excellent! Even a little fork to force the delicious marrow out of the bone. The simple dishes, chicken parm, veal parm, pasta Alfredo.. All done simply and well. Next time you want Italian food done right let one of my favorite Italians do it for you. I really like my dinner cooked to order by the man in the kitchen and not the chef at headquarters. La Calabria does Italian right."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden jewel! We did not expect to find Italian food this good in Gilbert - what a wonderful surprise. I was a little disappointed that they were out of the risotto, but the Chicken Gorgonzola was delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time on a whim with my husband.  Megan at the bar was a wonderful host and offered good advice, which was supported by the owner/chef who came to introduce himself, then later stopped by to check in (nice touch).   We decided on bruschetta to start and then had lobster ravioli and spinach fettuccine.  All was exceptional.  Fresh ingredients and well prepared.  We're too full to eat desert but ordered some to go because it sounded so good.  We will be back for sure. ( food was devoured to quickly for photos so here's out to-go desserts)"}
{"text":"Every 6 months when I come to Mesa to visit my parents, I wonder if I will have a good dinner. This is easily the best meal I have ever had in the Phoenix area.   To be frank, I've never understood restaurants here. I have no issue with the Macaroni Grills and P.F. Chang's and other chains that seem to be the staple of eating out here; they are reliable and have good enough food. But every time I go there and see wait times of 45 minutes, I just wonder: is this really the only choice? Is good food so hard to come by here that we all have no choice but to endlessly wait to be served acceptable food in a frenzied atmosphere?  All of that has changed since we found La Calabria. Lurking in a strip mall in Gilbert is a place serving truly excellent food. After we lingered over amazing lasagna, delectable cheesecake, and great house wine for 2 hours, we left quite happy. It is true that the restaurant has the misfortune of being in a strip mall and that the ambiance suffers as a result. But the food made up for that, and the warm service (including from Clara, the owner and chef's wife) meant the most pleasant 2 hours I've ever spent eating in the area.  I guess it is quite possible that there is some amazing dining in Phoenix of which I am unaware; maybe there are other gems like this around. I tend to doubt it though; if this place were in my neighborhood of Greenwich Village in NYC, it would also be among the best in the area, and I'd be there every week."}
{"text":"The food isn't very good, I'm afraid. I wish it was because we live around the corner.  The chicken was \"sticky\" and I had to pull my mouth apart to continue chewing because my teeth were temporarily stuck together with each bite. Calamari was tough and extraordinarily bland. Salad was small, but ok.  The marinara sauce was pretty good. The service was mediocre but polite. The ambience is lacking. At $20 a plate I was thoroughly unimpressed. The kids didn't eat much of their meals.  I hate to say that I would have rather went to a chain restaurant, because that's not my usual way, but a chain would have kicked Calabria's butt the night we went. I'm sorry to leave a poor review because I usually want family businesses to succeed. Maybe we just ordered the wrong 5 dishes and caught them on a bad night but we're not eager to return."}
{"text":"Last night we had a birthday celebration for two family members at this restaurant. It was our first time there , we were a party of 7 . Our server was Clara and she couldn't have been nicer plus she was so efficient !! Our meals from the appetizers to the salads and the entrees were absolutely perfection !! Our dessert, the Ricotta Cheesecake was to die for !! Everyone had a great meal and we all left happily full , even had to take some food home as the portions were very generous . Their wine selection is excellent too ! We will certainly be going back to La Calabria! So many great things on the menu to try next !!"}
{"text":"We love La Calabria. The food is so delicious, BEST Italian we've had out this way. The owner is so friendly and helpful. We will likely miss their first Wine Dinner as we'll be in Italy. So disappointed to miss it! We highly recommend La Calabria."}
{"text":"Decided to try the new location.  The restaurant decor looks very cheap inside and the food was just okay. Nothing was really bad, but, nothing was really good either. With no ambiance, I'd think the food should make up for no ambiance; it did not.  The pasta was good, the sauce okay, the salad was small and simple, and the bread seemed store bought with tacky individual plastic container butter.  It felt like eating at a cheap banquet.  The portion sizes are small for the price, which would be fine if the food was amazing.  The service was good and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"Great calamari-  I'm from NJ so I know Italian food.  Good sauce.  I recommend going for lunch.  Good lunch menu and reasonable."}
{"text":"You can tell that these are old family recipes prepared by a chef with a passion for cooking. I had the Lobster Ravioli mmm... just perfection!!! The pasta is made fresh in house daily (no one does this anymore). The immaculate kitchen is open so all the smells and sounds of the chefs cooking roll into the restaurant. great casual date night."}
{"text":"It was that time of the year again; Anniversary!  The food at this place was recommended by a friend of a friend so I decided to check it out.  I went to the website and loved the Italian music that played while I checked out the menu.  The items looked very interesting so I decided to make that our celebration destination for that year.  I called and spoke with a very nice sounding lady and made a reservation for 7.  I informed her it was our anniversary dinner and she replied with \"Come hungry and thirsty!\".  Upon arriving, we were a little thrown off by what we saw.  We weren't expecting a fully floodlight lit rectangular room with a full glass wall to the parking lot packed with both low and high(!) tables and a 5 seat bar area.    We walked up to the desk and were greeted with \"EVERYONE wants Italian tonight...\" as she was frantically moving through papers, receipts and other items.  \"Do you mind a high table?\" she asked.  My wife and I just looked at each other.  \"If that's all you have for our reservation I guess that will have do.\" I said.  RED FLAG ONE!  The table was dirty so we stood next to it while 3 people came over to clean it off.  We sat down and realized no one had wiped the table so when the waitress came over to put the uh...  paper... place mats down we asked for someone to wipe it, which someone did.  The paper was put down on the wet surface and immediately soaked through.  ~sigh~  We were handed our menus.  I had to put mine down three times to accommodate all of the arms in front of me putting down glasses and apparently there was some OJT going on with respect to how the silverware is supposed to be placed on the table so it took some time.  I snickered to myself as the waitress explained that the salad fork goes to the left of the main fork... (both forks were identical).  But I digress.  My wife had an odd expression on her face.  I had to almost shout over the cacophony  (many tables with loud children/bad parents).  RED FLAG TWO!  I queried:  \"See anything you like?\"    The look that was returned said it all. RED FLAG THREE!   We got up and left and went to Anzio's Landing in Mesa and had a wonderful quiet time in a cozy booth with nice mood lighting.  Perhaps someday I will try the food."}
{"text":"Had a great Fathers Day meal last night at Calabrias.   We started off with fried calamari- cooked to perfection. My husband ordered the pasta  special - homemade fettucini with crab meat and spinach.  He LOVED it!  I had the veal piccata which was Delicious!  We also order a white wine by the glass Pio ? - $10 per glass and it was wonderful!   Capped the evening off with a shared tiramisu ( the best we ever had) which was homemade, an espresso & cappuccino.  What a great way to celebrate a wonderful father and husband at a very low key restaurant! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place offer one of the best Italian food that I ever tasted.  It is better than many places in Milan and Rome.  The garlic were cut into bite size where yet it is not over powering which your date might detest later.  The clam with white wine sauce appetizer were excellent without many places that overly spiced like majority of true Italian restaurants.  The liguini de Mare (seafood) were cooked with just the right flavor.  We even saved room for a great creme brulee at the end.  The meal cost $70 dollars which is a little high for the neighborhood but every penny was worth it.  Friendly service"}
{"text":"Family owned, very fresh food and great staff! Great place to slow down and enjoy a delicious meal. Daily specials offerred that are not found on the regular menu...try them! The atmosphere could use a little touch up to provide more comfort feeling but once the food came....didn't care about the atomosphere. The flavor of the foods just popped. I had a dish called chicken principessa, chicken breast with eggplant, roasted peppers,mozerella cheese, artichoke hearts and peas with a white wine/maranara sauce....loved all the vegetables and the sauce was light and brusting with flavor! Already planning a trip back to take my mom, soon. The chef is the owner and visits the dinning room often to speak with the guest on how the food taste."}

{"text":"La Calabria came highly recommended, so we gave it a try on Saturday.  Coming from NY, we know great Italian food and the Olive Garden does not cut it for us.   The ambiance was very inviting as were the staff and owners.   I have to say, it was one of the best Italian restaurants we've been to in years.   We can always judge a good Italian restaurant by their Fried Calamari and. I have to say, it was by far one of the best around.  For the entrees, we ordered the Linguine di Mare (Seafood dish) that had an ample amount of seafood and the taste was absolutely delicious.   My husband had the Chicken Rollatini which was probably one of the best we've had.   The desserts are homemade.  You've got to try the Cheesecake and the Tiramisu which was perfectly made.   We loved the food, the atmosphere and the entire staff made us feel as if we were family.   Five days later, we went back again last night w/friends and we all left very satisfied.  I know this is going to be one of our favorite weekly hangouts.     Thank you for choosing Gilbert, Giovanni and Clara!!!"}
{"text":"I love the owners, Claire and Giovanni are so friendly.  They really care that your meal is enjoyable and that you leave happy. This restaurant is a favorite and a staple we go there least once a month. Yesterday for Valentine's Day they appreciate that return to much and we got free chocolate covered strawberries. We have never been disappointed with the many items that we have order off the menu. I love that Giovanni custom makes my dishes when I request it. If you are looking for true authentic Italian food this is your place"}
{"text":"The best thing about avoiding the big bad chain 'establishments' is finding the Mom & Pop places like this that make their own pasta fresh everyday.  The bar is small but fitting enough for a martini or two.  I love it when the bartender or server knows that extra olives means 3 or MORE.   We went with the special of stuffed mushrooms.  YUM!  the dressing on the salads was a little heavy handed but tasty.  I had the chicken gorgonzola  which was devine!  melted in my mouth.   My daughter inhaled her ravioli... ALL of them.  We split the lemonchello dessert.  I go back just for that! SADLY it was a special. I loved the small atmosphere and that the Wife runs the front of the house while the husband runs the kitchen.  There is a large wind from the dining room that you can watch your meal being prepared.  When the kitchen slowed he came out personally to check on the tables... I LOVE THIS. So thankful this place is close enough to bike to, as we will need to burn off the calories that we will be ingesting.    Can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Most Americans think Italian food is what you get at some chain restaurant.  Let me help you, nothing you get at a chain restaurant remotely approximates Italian food..  Having said that, La Calabria comes pretty dog gone close.  I've eaten here several tomes not and everything has been outstanding.  Actually, let me step back from that for a second...the salad that comes with the meal is a salad.  Not spectacular not bad, just a salad.  But what do you expect from lettuce?  A few other observations....  - its a store front restaurant.  Personally I don't care about things like that.  I learned a long time ago, you can't eat ambiance.  - I believe they bring the bread in.  Some days it's good other days it's good but a bit stale.  Notwithstanding anything even remotely negative here, the food still remains outstanding and at the end of the day, it's always about the food."}
