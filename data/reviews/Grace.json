{"text":"Not sure Grace needs another review but I haven't done one in a while so what the hey (or is that hay).   As everyone has said, the food at grace is scrumptious. This though was not apparent at first, as I was left wanting with our appetizers. My table shared the lobster ceviche and the the pork belly. The lemon and jalapenos in the ceviche overpowered everything; you couldn't taste the lobster. The pork belly was tasty, but I needed more of it to truly enjoy it (one order amongst three was not working....). Then our mains came and I was blown away.   I ordered the striploin and it was ridiculous. The sauce had so much depth and taste that I was discovering different flavours on every bite. Must had had something to do with the fois gras and chocolate in it.... My friend ordered the ricotta with mushrooms. They lightly dust the cheese in semolina flour and use it as a substitute for pasta. It was delicious. Like little pillows of goodness that burst in your mouth. If this dish is still on the menu when you go, I highly recommend it as its something completely different.   2 apps, 3 mains (2 of them were the striploin, the most expensive thing on the menu for $38), 3 house cocktails, 1 express and it all came out to $60 a head (with tip and tax). For what we had I'd say it's a pretty good deal. I do agree with Chris though, the restaurant was quite tamed, almost dead. If you want something a little more livelier, try cinq 01 next door. I admit the food is not on par, but it has a lot more character..."}
{"text":"Went to Grace for my friend's Birthday. We arrived 5 min early and asked if our table was ready. The hostess told us that they were in the process of clearing it. We asked if we could wait by the bar upstairs, but she told us that there was a private function going on, so we had to wait at the entrance. About 10 min later, she came to get us and showed us to our table. We reserved a table for 4 at the back of the restaurant. The area was really cute and it felt like we were sitting outside because the roof was raised, so the fresh, warm air was nice. The restaurant itself is very cute and welcoming inside. Our waitress seemed to be in a world of her own (since it was a late dinner, she might have been tired or who knows, but every time we asked a question or something, she seemed distracted). She was nice though! We ordered a bottle of wine and 2 appetizers to share: lobster civiche & proscuto, melon, & ricotta salata salad. Both were tasty and the presentation was great. My 2 friends ordered lobster ravioli and the waitress told us that they ran out. Not a good sign! So my friends had to change our order. While waiting for our appetizers to arrive, we asked for some bread, which was very fresh, crusty and warm, yum! However, 30 min later our appetizers still havent arrived. We asked what was taking so long and the waitress kept going into the kitchen to check. Maybe because of the private function, the service was very slow. We finally got our appetizers and then had to wait an 1 for our mains! Once they arrived they looked really good. We ordered gnudi with cherry tomatoes, which looked and tasted delicious! Best gnudi i have ever tried so far, so I will definitely would like to come back to try them them again. We also ordered lamb pasta, which was tasty, but they went wild on black pepper! It was overpowering and it felt like I was biting into black pepper with every bite. Overall, the place is very cute, not too loud, with a romantic atmosphere. The food is good, and the prices are reasonable. Oh and another thing, we brought our own cake for my friend's Birthday, and they told us that they would charge us $4 each for our own cake, but since we waited so long for our food, they took that charge off."}
{"text":"What has happened to Grace?  I have had dinner at Grace a half dozen times...the 1st 4 times were terrific (imaginative, very tasty good, good service) and the last 2 times in 2011 very very disappointing.  We chalked up the 2nd last experience to an \"off\" night in the kitchen...food was bland with little taste.  The last time...and this will definately be my last time going there for good....not only was the food mediocre (sweet pea & lobster ravioli, short ribs, salad), nothing standing out at all, but our waitress seemed completely uninterested in actually waiting on us.  She didn't ask if we wanted another drink when she saw our wine glasses were empty, requests for refills of water fell on deaf ears, we sat with dirty plates in front of us after finishing our entrees for quite some time.  When our waitress finally made an appearance, we asked her to recommend a dessert. Big mistake. She strongly recommended the ice cream sandwich which was nearly impossible to eat as it was completely frozen and had a terrible taste after we sat and let it soften.   I have been terribly disappointed in Grace the past 2 visits and will not be returning. If you want a better dining experience in the area, go to Acadia or Frank's Kitchen instead."}
{"text":"Great food and service always but the Sunday brunch truly stood out as the best in the city. Both the pancakes and the pork belly Benny are out of this world! To bad they cancelled brunch ... again."}
{"text":"This place was awesome great service, great wine, wonderful food, the best deserts. Try the homemade mint ice cream!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come to Grace for awhile now since I've heard good things about it and Gallagher from Top Chef is the exec chef.  I didn't have reservations but the front patio was open so my friend and I were seated there.   The waiter was attentive and took the time to answer questions we had about the menu.  We shared:  Stuffed quail with seared foie gras ($36) - I tend to order quail if I see it on a menu since it's not a usual item and well, I love foie gras.  The quail's stuffing reminded me of a turkey dinner's stuffing.  It was great - had a homey feel to it. The quail was delicious with its slightly crispy skin and moist meat.  The foie gras...oh I love foie gras. Did I mention that already?  Seared with minimal seasoning - mmm...melt in your mouth.   Lamb pappardelle with charred eggplant & mustard greens - the pasta was a bit thinner than pasta I usually have at restaurants.  It was good but I prefer pasta that's a bit thicker (I am a carb lover after all).  Large chunks of fall apart lamb deliciousness that was not gamey at all.  Didn't taste much of the eggplant but eggplant tends to absorb whatever it's in anyway.  Great dish but having started with the quail, it pales in comparison.   This place didn't disappoint at all."}
{"text":"I'm going to try a new point form review for speed and funness.   PROS: - Great atmosphere - Patio - Rear mini garden / patio (so nice!) - Super nice staff. They are also attractive. It helps. - I went in shorts and flip flops. I felt a little underdressed but the staff certainly did not make me feel it.  - Good food, although it could have been served a little hotter for my taste. - Super desserts / cheeses. Yum yum!  - Wine by the glass, 1/2 glass or bottle. They offer around 30 - 40 different wines if I remember correctly. - Offer vegetarian choices  CONS: - Back garden patio is always full / reserved. Book a table. - Tables fill up if you're a late dinner type of person. (although that might be a good thing. Would you really eat at an empty restaurant?) - Price is high, but not insane.  Would I go back? Yes. Would I suggest my friends go? Yes. Did I enjoy the duck? Yes."}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite meals I've had in a while. I've been wanting to go to Grace for a while because I was a huge fan of Dustin on Top Chef Canada and I finally got a chance when a friend from New York was in town for the weekend.  First, let's get a few negatives out of the way (which lost them a star).   1) We got there right on time for our reservation, but our table wasn't ready. There isn't much room to wait so the waitress mentioned we could go to the bar next door for a drink. We opted to wait for the rest of our party first and they arrived in a few minutes. When we told her we were going next door, as she suggested, she acted as if we would never return and made sure to remind is several times that our table would be ready soon.  2) They set up the 11-person table with 1 on the end, 6 on the booth, and 4 chairs. I suggested adding a fifth chair because the people along the booth were going to be crunched. She reluctantly agreed and brought over an uncomfortable wicker chair. When she wasn't looking we swapped it for a chair that matched the rest.  But despite that, I loved the place. Maybe the server was having a bad day, but the chef wasn't. The food was incredible.  My main was braised lamb maltagliati with confit shallots, roast endive and mustard sauce (yes, I have the menu open online). The pasta was perfectly cooked (tender, but not mushy), the lamb was perfectly cooked (rare and full of flavour), and the whole dish came together like a symphony in my mouth.  I also got to try a little of the duck confit, butter poached lobster, and beef wellington. All were excellent. Our side of the table couldn't stop raving about the food all night.  Finally, my date and I tried the sticky toffee pudding with pouring cream for dessert. It was delicious, not too sweet, and really fun to eat!  This is a restaurant I would definitely return to and a great place to bring someone from out of town to show off Toronto's subtle, but unique food scene."}
{"text":"Rarely do I feel compelled to write any sort of review, but after a recent visit to Grace I simply can't resist.  The food at Grace is lovely. It is not however earth-shatteringly clever, nor is it at the leading edge of trend. It is neither cheap nor expensive, but rather well and lovingly made, balanced, adroit and (somewhat) modern bistro fare. As it should be and, I'm guessing here, as the owners intended.  Likewise, the room presents itself with similar ease, the kind of place begging to be used as a second home by it's clientele to celebrate the mundane and special alike. Lighting is soft, the decor tasteful, unobtrusive; in a word, lovely. So far, so bistro.  Unfortunately, the spell is irrevocabley snuffed after our waiter pays us a first visit. In a flurry of \"pardon me\" and \"sir\" and \"excuse my reach\" and \"might this be of interest to you\" it becomes abundantly clear that this little restaurant takes itself rather seriously. Perhaps far too seriously. Things continue in much the same obsequious manner over the course of our two hour dinner, and it soon becomes apparent that this seriousness has had a rather deadening effect on the room. There wasn't a smiling face in the room.  Of course this isn't the first time I've experienced such a disconnect while eating out in Toronto. Batifole and Loire both have rooms filled with reverential people, waiters and clients alike, people for whom this supper must be a terribly big deal. I once sat beside a women wearing a very large fur coat and carrying a golden clutch at one of these restaurants.   Perhaps in another place, in another town, Grace would be fun: a smart little bistro with lovely, comforting food where, you can bet, neighbors and friends would gather a couple of times a week to drink wine and talk,  laugh and catch-up. Instead, Grace is a place with deeply bowing waiters,  a host in a dinner jacket, a decibel level similar to that of a library, and  customers for whom this means something.   Regrettably Grace belongs to a family, along with the two previously mentioned bistros, of painfully self-conscious restaurants that, while full, will never be fun."}
{"text":"I took my parents here a few weeks ago and I can honestly say that this is one of the the best meals I've had in 2009.  The restaurant itself is very nice (more casual than some but still nice) and open. One thing that pleased me is that the tables were an adequate distance apart from each other to give some privacy. The service here was fantastic. My mom usually asks a tonne of questions about how dishes are prepared and where the ingredients are from. The server we had was very friendly, patient, not pretentious at all and above all very knowledgeable.  Another thing I liked about this place was that the drinks were reasonably priced. Each of us had a few drinks and then a bottle of wine, and the bill was still very reasonable. Also, my mom had a cocktail (I believe it was a shot of vodka in a fruli with fresh blueberries) which she ordered on the server's recommendation and really enjoyed!  Of course, the best thing about this place is the food. We split the chicken liver pate as an appetizer which was insanely delicious and surprislingly just enough for three people (though it could easily be split between two). As a main I had the gnocchi, which is hands down the best I've ever had. The portions are small, however they are very filling and even more delicious. My mom had the port steak and my dad a pasta dish. I tried both, and they were great (but not as good as the gnocchi!). For desert we split a slice of rhubarb pie - for the record, I don't usually like pie - which was fresh and not too sweet.  All in all, a fantastic experience. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Grace is one of the best restaurants in Toronto right now. Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable and intuitive. The service here, in general, is impeccable. Our wine glasses were never empty and we were made to feel very welcome. Great wine list, too!  On to the food. My clam chowder was incredible. Rather than the usual heavy creaminess, this one is foamed up to create something unexpectedly light and heavenly. The roast duck is also delicious, accompanied by very thinly sliced potatoes which are fried to a crisp in duck fat. I finished with a lemon tart that cut through all the fatty goodness I just finished eating. I'd like to tell you what my girlfriend had but I was completely consumed by my food.  It's worth mentioning that they have a room upstairs, too, that is far more relaxed - they do a TV Dinner night on Thursdays. This is an absolutely fantastic restaurant that is doing everything right!"}
{"text":"I just received an email through Open Table stating that Grace cancelled my reservation for Saturday. I called to find out what the issue was and received a completely unhelpful response from the hostess who had no idea why the reservation was cancelled and told me they no longer had space.  I would expect her to at least be apologetic even if she could not accommodate me at the original time (even though only 3 hours had passed since the cancellation) or to offer to reschedule. Her attitude instead was basically, \"not my problem\". The reservation was to celebrate Valentine's Day as well as my anniversary."}
{"text":"I simply had to write a positive review about Grace upon seeing the poor ones that are offered here. I certainly feel for the patrons who had what looks to be a genuinely unsatsifying meal, but I have to say that this dining experience was perhaps my best of 2008!  We had a reservation and our table was set and ready to go despite our arriving a few minutes earlier. We were settled in and from the minute we were seated our server arrived to welcome us, and like the atmosphere, was all things friendly, warm, and anything but stuffy. A deliciously intimate setting warmed with subtle lighting and simple decor made it feel warm, relaxed, and just like we were at Jerry Seinfeld's farmhouse (that is, if he were to have a farmhouse, and more importantly, if I were to be invited to said farmhouse).   We started with a dozen osyters on the 1/2 shell to share, which were cool, smooth, and with the dressings, had a perfectly satisfying kick. And I don't even like oysters that much. But what can I say, the blissful mood of my surroundings turned me all gastro-'daredevil'.   For mains, we were presented with the halibut (for myself) and the beef steak for my dining partner. Nicely presented - modern, but without that whole contemporary-art-on-a-plate snobbery. What can I say? Everything was divine. Just imagine how good it could be, and it is. Chef Dustin does his work wonderfully here.  The real treat of the evening is the dessert, where the idea of \"simple country goes uptown\" comes full-circle. We went with the highly recommended cookies and milk (by our attentive server, of course), and it was a delight to watch as he poured organic Harmony milk out of its quaint country-style bottle and into a glass for us. From here on in, it was all about dunking and savouring the oven fresh, melt-in-your-mouth cookies. Bliss.  Thus, while I can completely sympathize with my fine fellow Yelpers, I suggest giving this place a shot. If your experience is anything like mine, it will be a dining experience you shall be smiling back on for a long time."}
{"text":"This was one of the most solid meals I've had in a while. It is very cosy and classy and they were very accommodating and quick considering there were 8 of us for a birthday party here.  I was so impressed with both my appetizer and main course. I ordered the half portion of gnocchi with wild mushrooms. It was the best gnocchi I've ever had - it felt light with the right textures and flavours. Yes...light was how I'd describe it which is odd thing for something traditionally potato-y/carb-y. There was also plenty of mushrooms to make me happy.  The main course was rabbit with fiddleheads and things I couldn't identify or recognize easily. But also such a solidly prepared dish. They sure didn't skimp out, I was happily full, enjoying every bite. I did try some of my friend's fish and it was delicious too.  Everything was quick, the service was really on the ball, I can't think of any complaints. I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a 1 star if not for the fact that I came there during winterlicious. I was blown away by the picture on yelp, but I don't see that when I had my meal there. I was expecting a homey food and experience.  1. They sat me close to the window and this is winter in Toronto, so of course I got a lot of wind blowing to me whenever people open the door.  2. No butter knife, so I had to re-use the knife to cut my main course  3. The service makes me feel like I'm eating at a fast food place (literally). The appetizer came right after I decided what to eat. There was no time to sit down and just enjoy my drinks. I feel that this might only occur during winterlicious because I've never been there during regular days.  4. When I ate my dessert, I moved the plate a little bit towards me. I felt something sticky on my finger. It might be chocolate, but I wasn't sure. This just screams disgusting. Seriously? A restaurant that can't even keep their plate clean is just disgusting.  5. Automatic 18% gratuity. Grace, your service is sloppy and you get to have the last word and say that you reserve an 18% gratuity? This makes me feel that you're only into my money (and it certainly did with how fast you want me out)  Now, let's get onto the food, shall we?  1. Ordered the bison carpaccio. The meat was thin and tender. It tasted fantastic except for the fact that, one side was saltier than the other.  2. Had the braised beef. The beef was braised okay. It had what seemed like a blanched kale and lumpy boiled potatoes. The potatoes was awful. Sometimes it was soft, but sometimes it was hard. This just proved that you can't boil potatoes right. The kale could be cut smaller so that it would have more surface area to absorb the sauce.  3. Warm sticky date square. Apart from the dirty place, I actually love the taste. It was sweet, but not too sweet. The oatmeal did a great job balancing the sweetness. I think this would taste better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to balance the warm temperature, but this might just be my preference.  Overall, I wouldn't come here during winterlicious. Save your money for some place like auberge du pommier."}
{"text":"There's something in the air at Grace. You walk into a cute restaurant, just West of Bathurst, and immediately you know they mean business. The colours are soothing, everyone's plates look like Food Network perfection, and the servers walk around with white tees and aprons, like they just stepped out of the kitchen to escort you through this journey. You just get an exciting feeling that good food is happening here. Everyone knows.    There was an amazing Fall deal going on, two courses for $20. First comes sourdough bread in an apple basket with butter. The smell was unreal but I could have been more impressed if the bread were warm. I started with bison carpaccio. The dish was incredibly unique and stunning in presentation. The rare meat was slightly seared on the outside, cut expertly thin. There was truffle oil, little sprouts and apple. It was a delicate dish that I finished quickly, hungry for what was to come.   The choice of main was pork, catch of the day and a vegetarian orzo pasta. Enjoy, vegetarians! You are safe here. I ordered the catch of the day, irresistible haddock. The fish came with a crispy crust laid overtop vegetables like eggplant, ribbons of zucchini, diced pepper, onion, sprouts and leek. The slabs of eggplant felt undercooked but otherwise, the vegetables were well seasoned and tender. I loved getting a sliver of leek here and there. To the pesto and pesto oil that dotted the plate, while not the most original choice, did have great flavour adding a Mediterranean feel. A swipe of a red pepper sauce was creamy in texture, but still fresh addition. I loved that there was a zip of lemon stinging throughout.   Our service was unintrusive but very present in the dining experience. The glasses of cucumber water were always full to the brim. Those were some amazing plates of food for a great value. Can it be $20 for two dishes every day?"}
{"text":"A few close friends of mine swear by this restaurant, which is always nicer than swearing about the restaurant. Upon looking it up online, I was immediately intrigued when I read that it is \"inspired by family gatherings and Sunday dinners.\" That line sold me and it wasn't hard to twist a few rubber arms in order to get a small gathering of friends to join me.  Grace is cosy and classy, which is always a winning combo in my books. The walls are decorated simply and it has a comforting type of farmhouse feel to it. It's the type of place where you want to enjoy a nice meal and then lay down for a comfy nap.   As for the food, well it's not only cooked by a well-known and televised chef, it's also straight up delectable. The beef wellington with parsnip puree is pure (or should I say puree?) genius and the warm mushroom salad was enough to make my eyeballs roll back in my head. Simply delicious and cooked to perfection. The menu isn't extensive by any means, but you won't be hard pressed to find a meat or seafood dish that will send your taste buds into a tizzy. Scout's honor.  I would definitely return to Grace, but I'll have to remember to bring my blanket for that nap I told you I'll need to take after that last bite has disappeared. Sweet dreams."}
{"text":"Went to Grace at the last minute and thankfully they weren't too busy on a thursday night. The space is bright and light and airy, with a good number of tables that they've arranged to keep a nice amount of space in between. Our server was friendly and prompt without being too noticeable, plates were whisked away and fresh cucumber water refilled consistently.  They were doing a special where your main and desert were only $20, which was too good a deal to pass up. Myself and one other party ordered the daily catch (which ended up being halibut/haddock? I dont remember) in a light cream sauce with wild mushrooms, sliced potato fingerlings and sweet corn. It was delicious and I barely resisted licking my bowl. For desert they had a homemade ice cream that was a lemony flavour with a graham cracker base and chunks throughout. Again, delicious. I ordered a drink special that was described as 'autumn in a glass'. Apple cidery, with ginger and lemon tang.  Have to visit again to try out their brunch menu, if its anything like their dinner I might have a new favourite."}
{"text":"I went back to Grace after a year last week and a lot more than the menu had changed. I was meeting my friend's bf for the first time and I wanted the venue to be great. It turned out to be the most tedious evening ever. The difficulty in getting a table should have been an indication - I was told that I could get a table at 7:30pm and they need to turn it around at 9:30pm. I understand that restaurants need to make money but being this up front about it makes one feel very unwelcome. Once we arrived, we were seated between two crowded tables and barely had any elbow room. No sooner had we been seated the host came by to ask us for our wine order and kept coming back every five minutes till we finally ordered. We felt rushed and bullied. Once we started ordering we realized the menu had completely and all the comfort food Grace is known such as the corn chowder with crab fitters for was MIA. When I asked about it I was snarkily told off. What was even more surprising was that half the stuff on the current menu was not available either and they had substitutes that didn't sound great. I ordered the lobster and at $39 it was the most expensive dish on the menu. It tasted ok but the portion was small and the lobster was definitely overdone.   Grace's key differentiator was the warmth in it's food an ambience. Unfortunately it no longer has that on it's menu or in the host. Time to move on - adieu Grace."}
{"text":"Grace is quite possibly one of my favorite local restaurants! I've been three times, and I've found the wait staff to be friendly, and knowledgeable; the décor to be clean and romantic; and the food to be delicious and in-season.   The menu varies with each season, so it's easy to visit more then once. The portions can be on the smaller side, so be sure to ask the waiter if you're concerned.  I highly recommend making a reservation, as the restaurant does fill-up fast. If it's warm out, ask to be seated in their courtyard; if it's winter, ask to be seated by their corner window! Great place to impress a loved one- Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were seen canoodling here last Summer, pre-breakup.   If you're a big group, reserve their upstairs room- it's perfect for an intimate group dinner."}
{"text":"My 300th review! Schweeeet.   Me, my husband and two other dining companions stumbled into Grace on a Friday evening, where they'd been able to grace-fully take us on super-short notice (Sidecar, our intended dining destination, had some sort of emergency which closed down the kitchen  -- boo hoo!). The restaurant was full, and the first thing I noticed was the noise. It really bounces around in there when the house is full, so it's a little hard to have conversation. The decor, however, is cute -- modern shabby chic. It reminded me a lot of Dinette, one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle.   Anyway! On to the nomz. I started with the bufala mozzarella and charred radicchio salad, which I really enjoyed despite usually being down on radicchio. Charring it brings out a nice sweetness to it. Delish. For my main, I had the braised beef cheeks, which was a giganormo portion. Huge, but delicious: super tender, with melty and unctuous fattiness. YUM. For my taste, it could have used a more substantial starch than the little hash it came with; something to soak up the juices would have been lovely. Still, it was awesome.  Service was good, though due to the noise it was hard to hear the relatively soft-spoken server.   I definitely wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"Grace is going on my 'best of Toronto' list-I had an outstanding dining experience.  First of all the pictures on their website do not give Grace justice. The restaurant is better dressed than the casual photos on the website. It has a MadMen feel, with wooden and leather chairs. Very classic. The dining spaces are extremely roomy, I almost felt like half of my dining party was too far away at the other end of the table :).   Service is impecable. The waitress knew the menu well and was able to make wine suggestions. We came here for winterlicious-highly recommend taking advantage of this menu. I had their mixed greens salad with tingly sweet, but still light flavoured dressing. Followed by buttery soft haddock in bed of white beans, and small canning jar full of sumptuous creamy chocolate pudding for dessert. Oh my it was mouth-watering, amazing food! And for $35 a great price.  Well done Grace, I will return for your regular menu :)."}
{"text":"A very nice treat!  Met with another couple here for an enjoyable meal.  For appetizers, I had the hen egg salad which had a really intricate taste owing to the blue cheese garnish, while Abby tried the squash soup which she raved about.  I had the pork belly duo for my main and Abby had the roast duck which she completely devoured.  Overall, we were all quite pleased with our meal and the excellent explanations provided by our server.  The ambiance was relaxed, with ample table space and enough room between us and other diners for us to actually be able to enjoy our conversation.  For dessert, we split the brownie sponge with peanut brittle.  It came off as a slightly inferior version of the famous molten chocolate cake dessert (and the peanut butter brittle was a little too hard for my liking).  Total came to about $75/person including tax & tip, which included about two drinks each.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Yay!  I was so pleasantly surprised last night to have a great meal in their upstairs lounge at the bar.  It was around 8 PM and we did not have a reservation for 2.  Instead, we went up to the bar, where it was not noisy or crowded and was able to order the full menu.  We had the fish chowder which was delectable.  A creamy broth and 3 beautiful dumplings that had fish and I think, green peas.  We both also had the make-shift special (apparently, the kitchen will come up with new dishes not on their petite menu when something on their petite menu sells out).  It was a beef ragu on pappardelle.  I did not expect the beef ragu to be tender pieces of braised beef and for such a good bounty of pappardelle in a tomato based sauce.  The pleasant surprise I got from an early bite was the garlic - they used whole cloves of garlic that were boiled or something first and then added to the sauce and they delivered such a nice sweetness and non-bitter-tang that garlic can bring.  For dessert, I had the cookies with milk - I can't resist a good cookie and there were 3 kinds of cookies, 2 each!  A half a dozen all for me!  And my husband ordered the coconut lime cream pie which was also very well crafted.  We had alcohol with our meal and with tip and tax we were just under $150 for the whole meal.  It was great and I'd definitely go back to sit up at the lounge.  The actual restaurant is small and crowded and definitely noisy."}
{"text":"I cannot resist a play on words here: Grace delivers on its moniker and is the embodiment of elegance and grace. Focused on homestyle cooking in a light and airy setting, it is all comfort and charm. However, the food is much better and a little more stylized than what I have come to expect in my own home.  Both times I have visited Grace I have done so in their upstairs private room, which can be booked for both cocktail receptions and private dining. I have been lucky enough to experience the former and the latter, and was dually impressed. If you commit to a minimum spend of $1000 you too can book the private room which boasts a communal lounge area, its own bar and the appropriate setup for either cocktails or sit-down dinner.  At dinner we feasted on a pumpkin-squash cream soup, tender bison steak, rosemary roasted potatoes and an assortment of roasted green vegetables, aptly followed by an apple pie (called something more fanciful). It was all served up \"family-style\" and shared amongst the group, adding to the communal atmosphere. It was such a charming experience in a city sometimes lacking in such character.  I'll be back for a deux-a-deux more intimate dining experience."}
{"text":"I went to Grace for the first time with a rather large group (12 people) and the dinner was much better then expected.  The decor of the restaurant is mcuh niced than I expected and the restaurant a little more formal than what the neighbourhood would suggest.  Jeans and a golf shirt felt a bit out of place here.  Started off with a great cocktail (the \"southern gentleman\" i believe), bourbon and peach and smoked strawberries and some other ingredients that I can't recall.  But it was good.  Really good.  I had the special ap of the day - crispy lobster, and man, was it amazing.  So good.  Better then the famous rock shrimp dish at Nobu (at least I thought so).  Other I was dining with had the pork belly which wasn't bad.  For mains I was able to try the Gnudi (ok, a little disappointing after tasting everything else), chicken pot pie (amazing), cocoa and cayenne (i think) rubber tenderloin in foie gras sauce (amazing), the pork chop (amazing) lamb linguine (not that special).    Desserts were so-so but I am not that much of a dessert person.  People at teh table loved the banana cake  Service was pretty good (i loved the tap water with cucumber slices, so simple but the subtle flavour difference was great), but our server didn't seem to know the menu very well or the ingredients in certain dishes.  It was also weird how they told us we had to give up the table by 9:00 to find the resturant still half empty when 9 struck.  We ended up staying past 10.  All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Went for the first time a few days ago. I had read lots of glowing reviews and Grace did not disappoint. The space is small and warm, simply decorated with some old photos. Our waitress informed us of several changes to the menu, as the chef was \"inspired by the nice weather\". I opted for the ricotta gnudi. Portion was a bit on the small side, but probably better that way as the dish was quite rich. Gnudi is similar to gnocchi but with less potato/pasta and more cheese. Pure, melt-in-your-mouth goodness... For dessert, I had the banana cake which was moist and drizzled with chocolate sauce and served with chocolate ice cream.  My friends were also happy with their meals, except one ordered the crispy pork belly appetizer and did not realize that it would mostly be fatty meat. My other friend had the daily special, large prawns with avocado and mango salsa. Delicious! For mains, they had the Halibut (pretty large piece, actually) and Pork Chops with apple terrine.  Service was attentive, although timing was a bit off (brought our appetizers very quickly and then a very looooong wait for our mains). Another thing I noticed is that they serve wine by the 1/2 glass, glass, or bottle. With three people who don't drink that much, I usually like to get a half litre and wished they had that option. All in all, a very pleasant meal though."}
{"text":"It was a rainy, dreary, almost miserable night in Toronto.  My local friends/coworkers made reservations at this establishment called \"Grace\", located on a busy street with diverse pubs and shops.  We got out of the cold and wet and into a wide, comfortable booth.  The atmosphere in Grace is refreshing.  There is ample space between tables, and for what dimensionally is probably a small and skinny room, it's very airy and bright.  The perfect environs to sit back and then dive in to superbly crafted food and drink.  And so we did...  The menu items are composed of simple ingredients.  I think the description I've read is \"Farmhouse Cuisine\".  I imagine that's accurate because the meats are seasoned very simply, and at the same time are almost unrealistically flavorful, bold, and juicy.  My girlfriend ordered a dish that included beef cheeks - which was some of the most succulent tasting beef I've ever had.  I actually cannot even remember my own appetizer - probably a halibut that was also tender and delicious - but the beef cheeks I just can't get out of my head.  We had a very enjoyable meal and the portion size with our small plates (beautiful salads) and entrees was such that there was no room for dessert.  Service was perfect - not overbearing, but always with polite suggestions and nicely timed water refills.  They also allowed us to split the bill 3 ways for a party of 4, and we were very appreciative of that.  Price is high, but this is the kind of restaurant that demands the cost of luxury.  It was a disappointment to exit Grace and stumble back into the rainy street.  If I had another bottle of wine I could have slept in the booth.  But alas, all good things must come to an end."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant!  The decor reminds me of an intimate, cozy Soho restaurant, with soft turquoise walls, dim lighting and waitresses dressed in pure white shirts.  The food is great - I haven't had a single dish here I didn't like. And they consistently manage to impress me with their slightly different take on classics - the clam chowder is light and foamy, and the gnocchi is light and fluffy. I find their food fresh, original and tasty!  My favourite has got to be the duck -- so tender, juicy and flavourful! The potatoes on the side are crispy and taste like chips.  I also find the portions generous, especially their appetizers. The clam chowder and crispy pork belly is almost big enough to be a meal in itself. However, I do have to admit I don't eat that much. I'm always stuffed and don't have room for dessert - which is too bad, because I've heard their desserts are also great!  It's a bit pricey, with the meat mains around $32, and appetizers around $12. So it's not an everyday restaurant, but great place to impress a date or for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Grace is a cute little restaurant located in Toronto's Little Italy neighborhood.  We went here for a friend's birthday and the food and experience was just exquisite.  Every single dish that came out of the kitchen was on point.  I had the succulent short ribs and iron grilled steak as the entree and it was so tender that they don't even bother bringing out a steak knife.  The dishes were not too large allowing me to eat a proper starter, entree and dessert.  Usually I rarely make it to dessert so the flourless chocolate cake was such a treat for me and I highly recommend it for chocolate lovers.  The feel of the restaurant is cute, romantic and classy.  One of my friends from the party was so impressed with the restaurant that he immediately made a reservation to take one of his clients and another said that he would take his date to Grace."}
{"text":"There are two things I expect in a restaurant when I dine: 1) when I make a reservation I want my table ready on time 2) I want good food.  On both fronts Grace, despite its divine leaning name, fell short.  My friends and I waited for 40 minutes for our table and when we finally got seated the waitress said we weren't allowed to order our appetizers and mains at different times because the kitchen was too busy.  Oh I 'm sorry, I guess the kitchen assumed that it would be dead on a Saturday night, in the new hot spot in town.   Because the food was not exactly exciting, my table decided to make our own fun but apparently this establishment's clientele does not abide a group of girls having a gay old time.  Rather, every time a giggle or squeak came from our table we were leered at by the not so yummy mommies next door.  IN OTHER WORDS:  Unless you are an aging divorcee looking to embitter yourself by waiting for a table, eating mediocre food, and finally topping off your evening by intimidating the younger girls at the table adjacent to you, this is not the place for you.  If you fit into any other category of the human race then I suggest you park your tighter, happier and smaller behind some place else."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews about Grace, I headed to the restaurant before catching a concert at the Mod Club.  Grace blew away my expectations. The environment is small, with neutral colours, ambient lighting and attentive staff. I swear, my glass of water was always filled, and the waiters that served my guest and I were always making suggestions and helping us order our meals.   I ended up choosing the red snapper off the dinner menu, and then got a strawberry mojito on the side. The snapper was delicious, however I kind of wish the salad portion of the meal was a bit bigger, and the mojito was a perfect touch to a hot summer day.  Meanwhile, I kind of splurged and got the butterscotch pudding for dessert which was OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING. I swear, the dessert was the real show stealer for me.  Would I return? Of course! The price is a bit high, but when your getting amazing service and good food, it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"I'd heard so much about this place, and decided to finally check it out one night. It took more than 5 minutes to be greeted by a host at the door, as she was busy serving as well. The waiter we had, told us about the specials, but mixed up details, so when we ordered one of the specials that he said came with scallops, it showed up with clams instead.   The appetizer, which was chicken pate, was good, but the presentation was poor, and the crisps were not suitable for it, with massive holes in the centre of each from poor baking and limited actual spreading surface. We also had the gnocchi and the seafood linguini. The gnocchi was over-run with rosemary, and the portion was very small.  Again, presentation lacking. The linguini was under-flavoured, and came with 3 shrimp and a few clams, which on their own seemed to have not been seasoned what-so-ever. The linguini noodles themselves were light and delicate, but the sauce was nothing special (I've had better at East Side Mario's), and again, the portions were very small. Had they offered a 5 course menu, the portions would have made sense to me, from what I've experienced at other restaurants of this nature.   We ended up being served by THREE different waiters by the end of the evening, which I've never had happen in a restaurant of this level before. Not once were we made to feel special that evening. We didn't even want to order dessert, which we'd been initially looking forward to, because we were so put off by the experience. We had heard this place was all about charm, but there was nothing charming about our dinner experience at Grace.  (Review X-Posted from Martiniboys.com)"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday night this past February per our friends' suggestion. So glad we did. Loved the atmosphere--it's clean, warm and romantic. Our server was very good."}
{"text":"The service was really good, the food was great, we sat in the teeny back patio, which was jam packed while the main restaurant was completely empty. It's as good as it looks. $140.00 plus tip for two without dessert though..."}
{"text":"Had a really wonderful experience at Grace last weekend. As soon as I stepped through the door, everything from the service to the food was excellent. The ambiance is elegant but homey at the same time, with clean white walls and rustic accent pieces.  To eat, I had the winter greens salad to start (which had a seriously addictive spiced almond pulse sprinkled on top -- highly recommended), the vegetable fricassee as my main, and cookies and ice cream for dessert. Portion sizes were perfect, ingredients were fresh and seasonal, and paired with a nice glass of Pinot Grigio and good conversation, the evening positively flew by.   My only complaint was that it felt a bit drafty in the restaurant -- so dress warmly in the winter. Given the evolving seasonal nature of the menu, I will definitely be back to experience more of what Grace has to offer!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.... I can describe the food as safe, tasty and straight forward.  Food by Canada's next top chef nominee was good. The quail was delicious and the salads were spot on I enjoy the ambiance and food at Grace. My second time here, I spent considerable more this time $185 for 2 cocktails, 3 apps and 2 mains. The service was prompt and friendly but our waitress did not have enough loudness when taking out order; quiet or shy. The roast beef was not warm enough and the meet did not blow me away. I will give four stars only because this location always gets me a spot with the ladies. Bring your lover to be and she will see."}
{"text":"I would give this 3.5 stars if I could, but given I'm feeling stingy with my stars today, I am erring on the low side.  Grace did nothing wrong. The service was friendly, the room is very warm and comfortable, and the food was good. That said, it was also completely safe and uninteresting. Not boring -- the worst of all restaurant sins -- but not particularly *memorable*. I would recommend and I'd also return, but there's a few other places I'll have to get around to first."}
{"text":"As an avid top chef fan, I'm on a quest to try out all the restaurants owned by the contestant. First on my list is Grace Restaurant, because the executive chef here is one of my favourite contestants (go Dustin!)  First of all, I love the simple and rustically charming décor. The use of pale, muted tones help to create a very relaxing dining atmosphere.  The menu here is described as \"contemporary farmhouse cuisine\". After a lengthy debate, I decided on the pork chop with braised dandelion, creamed corn, corn bread and homemade BBQ sauce, mainly because all the sides sounded so comforting and delicious. And delicious they were!  I also greatly enjoyed the bacon wrapped carrots that sat atop the pork chop. However, what didn't impress me was the protein itself. Although the BBQ sauce was quite nice, I couldn't get past the tough and dry meat.   My companion ordered the veal tourtière with rhubard raisin relish. It reminded me of a shepherd's pie, which can never be a bad thing. The rhubard raisin relish was very tasty when paired with the pie. I wished that we were given more relish! On a side note, I loved the rustic presentation on the wooden chopping board.  As usual, I couldn't resist ordering dessert. It was a difficult decision, but in the end, I opted for the chocolate hazelnut tart with salted caramel ice cream. The tart reminded me of a mashed up Ferrero Rocher. It was very rich, but luckily I was sharing the dessert so it wasn't too overwhelming.   All in all, I enjoyed my meal at Grace, but regretted my entrée choice."}
