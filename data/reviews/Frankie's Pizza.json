{"text":"A true back east pizza joint. Family run and you can tell, the pizza is delicious and their is something for any of your back home cravings, plus the service is outstanding. If your from the East Coast and you know good pizza then you MUST GO to Frankie's. NYC PIZZA IN VEGAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!!! Fabulous lunch specials, great prices, quality service!! Everyone is always super friendly from the moment you walk in until you leave!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. It's a little tasty reminder for us of NY. I think so far my favorite is the homemade raviolis and their white balsamic salads. Their pizzas are also very good. My husband likes crunchy thin crusts & I like soft but their pizzas meet in the middle of crunchy & soft so we both can enjoy it :) so glad we found this place & it's super close to our house!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, quality ingredients. Will be ordering from them again for sure. Great garlic knots."}
{"text":"First I want to start off by saying it's great to see a family who appreciates & works well with each other. It shows in the excellent quality and preparation in the food. I would definitely recommend Frankie's Pizza if you are looking for homemade authentic Italian food and great service."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick slice was surprised at how good it was and the garlic knot was amazing too as well as the sauce, definitely looking forward to trying some of their dinner items"}
{"text":"My friend at the sign company told me about this place... He was right.... GREAT FOOD and great family running the business... Try the garlic knots."}
{"text":"I love this place the atomosphere is great the staff is so friendly prices are perfect"}
{"text":"I love this food from this place ! I had the meatball sandwich, chicken sandwich, anti pasta and tonight we're trying the pizza.  Friendly People !  A Family owns it."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Stopped in for a slice at lunch and was impressed.   Looked over the full menu an am definitely going back for dinner.  The sauce on the pizza was delicious.  Friendly service, great soda , complimentary garlic knots, pleasant room."}
{"text":"We just ordered pizza last night from Frankie's and it was really really really good. Here is what My grandson thinks \"It's 10 a out of 10\" my other grandson Really loved it too .. and that's coming from a four-year.  I am not even sure where it is located but we will surely stop in sometime.   Prices were good too actually! Hard to find good pizza in the Silverado Ranch area  One more thing, they actually cook the pizza thoroughly and well done unlike everyone else Who seem to think raw pizza  is a good thing???"}
{"text":"You want to try real pizza then you must stop by Frankie's Pizza. Their pizza is fantastic. Made to perfection. It's a family owned establishment. A warm and inviting atmosphere when you walk in. So friendly. Heros, subs, chicken wings are delicious. Dinner specials are great and the prices are affordable. If you want delicious food I highly recommend you come to Frankie's. Trust me you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Family owned with delicious homemade food. Formerly Vito's. Pizza and garlic knots are great-the sauce is delicious. Had the calzone today & it was filled with ricotta cheese. You owe it to yourself to check this place out. Great food at a great price. I guarantee you'll come back."}
{"text":"Tried Frankie's because they were on UberEATS. Not disappointed! Loved the pizza, garlic knots, and especially the pinwheels! Garlic goodness! Will be trying again."}
{"text":"Frankie's Pizza is so delicious ! Best pizza in town!! It's ran by a cute family that make everything from scratch. The Balsamic dressing is the best!!! Garlic Knots, salad, pasta, everything is so delicious. Everyone is inviting and the pizzeria has great vibes. I recommend this place over ANY pizza joint!!!. Best of luck to the business!"}
{"text":"Mouth watering yummy pizza. It was so good my little one was devouring it as well...hes 1. My husband also loved it. Great price for great pizza and delivery"}
{"text":"I'm from Jersey so when I came across this place for the first time, I could tell this would be Authentic. I got the stromboli and the lady said we could add more to it! We added mushrooms and broccoli. It was so delectable! I took this photo, but probably shouldve taken a close up. I couldn't wait to eat so here's my hasty photo. I highly recommend this place especially if youre from NY & NJ. You wont be disappointed!!! This is going to be my new spot"}
{"text":"This restaurant opened about 2 months ago and I am so happy we found it! Please please try this place! Great service and the food is delicious :) They have yummy lunch specials - the eggplant parm sandwich and the pizza were both perfectly cooked and not too salty.  The marinara sauce is fresh and perfectly seasoned as well.  Oh and try the garlic knots! Great place and can't wait to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place, and it's not even close! The pizza was great, the garlic knots were great, the Family was awesome."}
{"text":"Pizza is good.  Stromboli was solid.  Meatball sliders were great.  Service with a smile.  I look forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!! We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, chicken wings, and garlic knots. The crust on the pizza was cooked perfectly. One of my pet peeves is when oil soaks through the crust, this was not an issue at all with Frankie's Pizza. Even reheated the next day the pizza retained the flavor! The garlic knots were huge and came with marinara dipping sauce (quite delicious). They do not offer boneless chicken wings but the wings were decent. Will definitely make Frankie's my go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Not much good to say here. I gave it a try because it was cheap pizza with decent reviews. In my opinion It's no better than Pizza Hut. 2 Employees were fighting in back...cussing each other out with customers listening in the dining room.pizza came out soggy and soda was flat. Save your money and go somewhere else for real New York pizza because these guys are peddling some fake made up version of New York pizza."}
{"text":"Words can't even explain how good the food is here. Service is great and you can feel the family owned atmosphere. I can't wait to come back and grab another pizza"}
{"text":"This is a gem! The garlic knot is great! Crunchy on the outside, but soft in the inside! The meatball slider is superb! The best I've had! The meatball is very tasty and the cheese is a high quality cheese!  The pizza dough is superb as well! A wonderful Italian restaurant & pizza joint!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! They have such a great menu. I had the antipasto salad, which was so good! My husband got the margarita pizza and we of course had to have the garlic knots. I highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pizza was cooked well and it was tasty. It honestly wasn't the best pizza in Las Vegas. But I would definitely return when I'm in the area. Delivered hot and fresh.  The pepperoni was much better than the veggie it was just lacking in the vegetable quantity to be considered one of their specialty pizzas. I would give them another try but would probably stick to regular pizzas."}
{"text":"If you are reading this, then perhaps you are like me. A neighborhood local who happened to catch a glimpse of the Frankie's sign through the trees as you were driving by, or while waiting for the light to change and wondered to yourself, \"What the heck is Frankie's?\" Then perhaps you also looked them up on Yelp, only to wonder again, \"What the... They have 5 stars?!\" Well I may not be a Foodie who dresses like a lumberjack, or have 500 Yelp friends and 800,000 reviews. But I tell you hwut, this is some good friggin pizza! It may cost a little bit of money, but I left with no regrets and will go back happily knowing that I am supporting a local business putting out quality product. Friendly staff with genuine smiles, clean shop, delicious food. What more could you ask for?  And if you want something different, try their entrées. We ordered a variety of menu items just for fun and it was all good :) Thank you Frankie's, for being close to home and for making my family happy. We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast and this pizza reminds me of home. The workers were extremely nice. My only complaint is they are not open more."}
{"text":"Update review: 4.13.18  Once again Frankie's pizza does not disappoint. We ordered something new philly chz steak & it was ONO...   Of course (moms) eggplant parmesan WOW! I will miss this once we move to Reno :(   Kristy we miss you girl, GW and Victoria congrats"}
{"text":"Pizza was good.  Waitress gave us a sample of garlic knots that were very good, especially since they were right out of the oven.  A distance away from the strip, but my husband and I like trying food places away from the crowds."}
{"text":"Pizza is life. So, when I found myself needing sustenance for a very long day, I turned to pizza to pull me through.  I decided to test out Frankie's, since it was very convenient.  We ordered a slice of pizza with Italian sausage, a Stromboli, and a pepperoni roll.   The pizza was not great. It lacked flavor, and the crust was tough.  The Stromboli was huge! You certainly get your money's worth here. I enjoyed it, but it could use a touch more flavor. It has just the right amount of meat.  The pepperoni roll was also good. This was the doughiest product, but I like that.   The sauce here is acidic and a bit oily. It's lighter in color than elsewhere and definitely has a distinct taste.   Overall, Frankie's is a solid choice for a NY style pizza spot."}
{"text":"Just ordered for the first time. Seriously it's delicious!!! I'll be a regular customer from now on."}
{"text":"Salad was fresh. Delivery was easy, but the calzone was all ricotta. So much ricotta that you couldn't eat it. Literally a 1 inch think layer of nothing but ricotta and a sprinkle of mozzarella. Inedible.  Sodas: ordered delivery. Thought I ordered bottles. Nope. Cups of melted ice and fountain soda. Don't order the soda.  Pizza was ok. Nondescript."}
{"text":"This was one of the first pizza places I tried and it is really good. The prices are great, portion sizes are great, and it isn't overly messy and greasy like you often find with places. A great place for family when you are in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"You can't beat their lunch specials. The pizza is sooo good & their garlic knots are amazing!  Staff are so friendly.  We will come back. I highly recommend Frankie's!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian style restaurant!  Everything I've eaten here has been fabulous, especially the traditional NY style pizzas. It's so rare to see such a great family working together to provide such excellent service and food. I now find myself craving this place for lunch and dinner, especially the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Frankie's Pizza for the first tonight.  The meat lovers pizza was excellent and the dinner salads with the white balsamic dressing was bomb! The cashier that waited on us was friendly and super accommodating!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop pizza eatery. Greeted with a friendly smile. Food was done quickly. Ordered a personal pepperoni pizza, penne with meat sauce, and ravioli. We also tried the garlic knots, sooo yummy!! Salad was fresh! Food was delicious, can't go wrong with any of these items. Whenever we are in LV, we'll be sure to stop in for great eats and service."}
{"text":"Let's put it this way, live in the NW but will drive across town for Frankie's.  Staff is friendly, but most importantly the food is authentic & tasty. Salad was fresh,  garlic knots & pizza are great.  Flavors & texture are just right. Highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Was recommended by my neighbor. I can say this will be one my favorite pizza places. We walked in and was greeted by the hostess. We read the specials and decided on multiple things. We order the pizza by  the slice special, meatball sliders and a chicken parm. First came the garlic knots omg they were so good. It was fresh and hot and the gravy was spot on.. the meatball sliders WOW were good. So moist and juicy. The pizza was good it was hot and very flavorful. Now the chicken parm was not like any other I have had before the chicken was juicy and it wasn't just one piece it was like three pieces and the bread wasn't dry or stale. The hostess/ waitress was very good and she can handle the stress of answering the phone, filling orders and serving our party. I will be back next week. Thank you for making my Saturday enjoyable"}
{"text":"Ate food from here a few times. Work across the street and our office has ordered here and their garlic knots are delicious. My coworker who's gone in to get our food said they would be more than happy to deliver to our office anytime. I thought that was pretty nice of them to offer."}
{"text":"I tried just a plain old pepperoni and mushroom pizza, they do make a good pizza, I will be back to try other food off their menu. The workers here were friendly both times I have been in the place.    The only downside is on-line ordering with this place, twice they have taken my order when Yelp said they were open and they were actually closed.  If I do order from them in the future it will be with a phone call and not on-line as I do not want another screw-up on my order."}
{"text":"Excellent New York-style pizza. Family owned, friendly service. I will definitely go back again and again!"}
{"text":"This pizza is SUPER DELICIOUS! The pizza also arrived Hot! This will be my go to for pizza from now on! Can't wait to try other items! Please send some coupons out so I can eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"I'm always searching for great NY style pizza. This is IT. The staff is always welcoming and friendly. Real family style restaurant. Super clean and organized. But let's talk about the delicious pizza and those amazing garlic knots... and the cannoli! Frankie's has become a weekly stop for us. Quality service, delicious food, and family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here twice since they opened and both times i had great food and service!  This is a family owned restaurant. It feels like I'm entering their home...you definitely feel the family atmosphere and all the love that goes into this place.   I think it's so sweet hearing their children calling back orders to their parents all with Italian accents from NY or something lol. I look back to the kitchen and see their \"Ma\" smiling as if to greet me and assure her son that she heard the order! It's the sweetest! Nice family for sure!"}
{"text":"Frankie's is a small family-run pizza joint slightly north of the Eastern-215 area. The service is super friendly and the newly-remodeled interior was decorated festively for the holiday season. A friend recommended this spot for a grab and go slice option, but I changed my order up on seeing the meatball sliders on the menu.   Garlic knots plus meatballs equals amazing. Fact. Frankie's version is bomb, with an entire halved ball on each of two thick, garlicky knots, covered with melty cheese and served with a cup of extra sauce for dipping. There's so much love and flavor in those two little sliders and they make a perfect lunch or a shared app. Eventually I'll try the actual pizza, but for now the sliders have my heart."}
{"text":"Ordered a hot sub, a sliced pizza and 10pcs wing. Took about 40min for delivery so I give 3 stars for fast service. Food was ok.. just ok. like samsclub/costco pizza and wings... Philly steak was really salty."}
{"text":"PS:  Review is for Frankies....... but I digress......I had tried \"Avanti pizza\" after reading all these great reviews about them...... no, not that great!  I should have known!  Avanti (a car maker name) needs to stick to making ugly cars, not pizza!  lol  So today, I was driving to the store, at the light on Wigwam, waiting to take a left onto Eastern and noticed Frankies Pizza sign staring me in the face across the street, as if to say, (said in an italian New York accent) \"Yo, whats-a-madda-you?  Why doncha try some real pizza?  Other pizza? ...Forgetta 'bout it!\"  So I was like okay THIS time I will try ONE piece and not buy a whole pizza just in case... Well I can tell you... I am SOOOOO GETTING THIS PIZZA FOR DINNER TONIGHT!!!  Its a really nice place with friendly people!   With all the \"New York\" friendliness, I had to check my location on my phone to make sure I was still in VEGAS!!!  It's like walking into a pizza place in New York.... I think.... I never have, but I am guessing it's like this!   The butchers back east in NE Ohio were very \"Italian\" friendly and I got this same great feel here!   (Sorry ADD moment) Yes, the knots are great!!!  While Grimaldis rocks, by the time you get a take out home its cold..... NOT Frankies!  I was also offered a water without asking.... cut IT'S HOT OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW  lol"}
{"text":"This was the first time we ordered from here and they didn't disappoint. The pizza was delicious and so was the wings and cheesesteak. The service was impeccable and we will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Great local spot to grab a pizza- I live right around The corner and can always rely on this pizza joint for a great pie whenever I'm in The mood for a great pizza!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Delivery was on time what a fantastic pizza.we will return. And let our friends  know about this place."}
{"text":"Ordered catering for my son's graduation party. Everything was hot and ready at the designated time...chicken parm, meatballs, salad, penne and garlic knots. The food was all delicious! All of our guests stuffed themselves silly.  Thank you for a fabulous feast!"}
{"text":"Brand new family owned I felt welcomed as soon as I came in. We had pizza, calzone,  meatballs and garlic knots. The flavor of the sauce was amazing, the calzone for 7.95 fed 2 people. Everything was excellent"}
{"text":"Food is average, but great value for the price! Awesome specials! Cute place with friendly service! Great spot for lunch, not very crowded, fast service and I'm able to dine in without rushing on my lunch break!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place!  The garlic knots are so tasty and the abundant dipping sauce is flavorful. The best part about the food is the cheese. They don't use the cheap mozzarella like you get at most pizza shops. This is that ooey gooey good stuff. Try a pinwheel too!  The family that owns this makes you feel at home. They always remember us!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Chewy but light crust. The wings were good. I was expecting more of a buffalo style wing, but these tasted more like they were in a marinara sauce, but I'm not complaining. They were delish! Will definitely be ordering from here again!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Pizza is very tasty.  Garlic knots are the bomb.  Must try locally owed establishment!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place after reading all the rave reviews. Nothing special. Pizza is way too greasy, soggy, and lacking flavor. The garlic knots our way to plane, and could use at on more flavor. The meatball sliders were the saving grace. Delicious, cheesy, and the only good part of the meal. Now we know. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Good quality and cheap pizza. My favorite things about this place are the Garlic Knots and the simple fact that they sell single slices all throughout the day and not just during the average business lunch rush. I'm glad I ate here instead of some over priced pizza on the las vegas strip."}
{"text":"So good! We ordered on uber eats and it was seriously perfect! Marg pizza was full of garlic and firm fresh flour dough! Must have this again!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys quality service and Great food. If your reading this review I wouldn't waste anymore time reading this and get right over there to enjoy the delicious food."}
{"text":"This place is family owned, family run, and has a great comforting family feel. Everything about this place is inviting. Real, AUTHENTIC, New York food complete with real authentic New York flair.   The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and the staff is even better. Highly recommend. Best pizza and Italian food around.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery though the Yelp app.  After an hour and a half, the driver somehow goes to the wrong address. You know, not the one I typed into the app to order my food with. Just some other address, not mine.  Look guys, I know it's 4/20 and you want to celebrate, but do not smoke and drive."}
{"text":"Want pizza?? Want real flavor ?? Go to Frankie's !! The pizza is amazing here . All the from the dough to the cheese to the toppings!! And to top it off the service is great . The employees here are all family I think . It's the mom and pops family pizzeria where the flavor comes from family history cook books lol."}
{"text":"I've never ordered from their site directly, but from the app \"EAT24\". I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT! The food is always on point, and gets here so quickly. Tonight I ordered at 7:08 and it was delivered at 7:35. Thanks, Frankie's Pizza!!"}
{"text":"Good food for the price. Everything we ordered was good - marghareta pizza, chicken alfredo, and eggplant parmesan. The stromboli how ever was too salty for my liking.  Our pick up order was late 10 mins. No biggie though we'll still come back"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant by a lucky happenstance.food is home cooked and prepared with each order. Without a doubt the best Italian food. The owners and staff are friendly and this is a must stop for me and my crew with every Vegas trip"}
{"text":"I LOVE Frankies Pizza! It is such a cute pizzeria and has a very close family feel. When you go in, they immediately greet you and the menu is clean and simple but has a great selection! I love their pizza because the bottom never gets soggy. Sometimes when I go to a pizza place, the grease and cheese makes the pizza slimy on the bottom and everything slides off when I eat it. Here the pizza stays just as fresh when you eat it as it did when it came out of the oven! They also have the best Italian sandwich! I don't know what it is, but it is delish!  They make sure you are always taken care of and enjoy your meal. They are an authentic pizzeria and you can taste the love for cooking in everything you eat!  OH! AND THEIR CANOLIS! How could I forget!? They make them from scratch and MMM MMM MMM! I eat here about 1-2 times a month. What can I say, it's really good!"}
{"text":"Wasn't crazy about this pizza.  The taste was good and the ingredients seemed to be quality.  However I've had a lot of New York pizza and the crust on this was chewy."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, hands down BEST pizza, meat ball garlic knot's, I eat here so often. Thank you Frankie's for being so close to my apartment for fast delivery!"}
{"text":"Really great Pizza. NY style. This is an authentic Italian family owned pizza place.  They're always really nice and everything I've ordered has been delicious."}
{"text":"Did my daughters birthday yesterday. Great job on time.  Always good food at a great price.  The owner is involved and that means a good product"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Frankie's Pizza for lunch. The girl at the counter was very friendly and helpful. The business is run by a family so they really care about your experience. The food is so fresh and flavorful I wished we could go back now! The next time we are in the area we will be visiting this place again. Tasty food, large portions and nice, energetic staff. You can't go wrong. Oh... I forgot the garlic knots! Soooooooo yummy!"}
{"text":"From the garlic knots, pizza, and hot subs. Absolutely everything was amazing, hot and fresh. The garlic knots were so delicious. The eggplant sandwich was one of the best I have ever had. The meatball sub was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Love their pizza and wings. Best I've had in a long time! Our new favorite place!! Strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Overdue review here. My friends are huge fans of Frankie's and they wanted me to try it out for myself. I am very happy that I did - their pizza and especially their calzones really hit the spot. It was delivered to us and the delivery fee was free, which was awesome. Will definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Fantastic! So delicious and everything is homemade! The service is fast and friendly and the food is unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is the best NY pizza and pasta shop I've found in the entire valley. Their penne vodka is better than what I've had at any 5 star restaurant. Everything is homemade and consistently delicious. And its family ran, which I love! Great spot for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new Italian spot & I found it!!!! Family owned & operated, simple home cooked Italian, great sauce & amazing cannolis!! Probably the best chicken parm sandwich ever! I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This pizza was amazing!! I am a pizza fanatic I will absolutely return to Frankie's. We also shared the garlic knots as an appetizer, they were excellent marinara had great flavor! This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"So impressed with the little things. First off. Didn't get nickeled and dimed for a side of ranch. Our special came with a garlic knot and marinara. Upon asking for a refill I noticed they poured my root beer from a bottle. Apparently the dispenser was out of root beer. Most businesses would simply say \"sorry we're out of root beer today\" but someone here cared enough to go buy some 2 liters to make sure their customers were served. It's the little things that add up.  Oh. The pizza. Top notch. Highly recommended New York style pizza. Not sure what else you need to read to give this place a shot.   Also, if supporting local businesses is your thing, the Mom, Dad, 2 daughters and the brother all work here. Living the American dream!"}
{"text":"Saw this on yelp and was in the neighborhood so obviously I had to try it. Pizza was really good! Great family owned business friendly staff. They didn't kill you with the prices either. I definitely will be back and recommended it to my friends!"}
{"text":"At the advice of a co-worker from New York I called Frankies when I left work and placed an order to go. Antipasta salad, garlic knots, cheese pizza and cannoli. It was just being boxed when I got there 20 minutes later. The girl on the phone was friendly and so was the girl that rang up my order. Salad, garlic knots and cannoli were 5 stars! Pizza was 4. Needed a bit more garlic in the sauce. I am looking forward to trying the dinners. Prices are affordable. Love supporting local businesses especially family owned. Definitely will go back! Probably this weekend.  Went back on 7/10. My son had baked ziti and I had eggplant parmigiana. We shared garlic knots. So happy wil the dinners too! Portions were large. Price was great. This will be our new go to place"}
{"text":"Frankie's is the best little pizza place in town! You feel like you are home with the excellent hospitality and amazing customer service. Everything is homemade and absolutely delicious!! You will definitely leave with a full, happy belly!! I LOVE FRANKIE'S PIZZA!!"}
{"text":"I lived in New York for the last 15 years. What do I miss most? The pizza. I heard this place was run by a NY family and made it a point to go. The family is great. I got my 10 inch cheese home (the true test) and  just to make it crazy hard, I also got a pinwheel. The pizza was perfect, just like my favorite spot on the UES and the pinwheel was so good I didn't want to eat it! Brought me right back to Brooklyn. Amazing. The garlic knots were so fresh and not dense like others I have had here. I can't wait to try the pastas and the meatballs. P.S. I have never felt compelled to write a review before. P.P.S. I can't stop thinking about that pinwheel. This isn't New York \"Style\" pizza. It's the great slice from every neighborhood I lived in."}
{"text":"new update  Tried the grandma's pizza, garlic knots, something different from last time. And this what I can say.....EXCELLENT!!! This place never disappoints"}
{"text":"Was here a week ago and we r back again. Mom and pop style kind of joint. The food was bomb, the service was on point. Will be comin back more often. Oh and their cannoli so good!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever & I love the garlic knots are amazing wish they gave out more & soup was delicious as well ! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Frankie's pizza is great! first time.getting it and they didn't disappoint. The pizza isn't greasy, it's easy to cut and not chewy; it's perfect ! thank you!"}
{"text":"I have tried many pizza places around Vegas and Italy. I think this restaurant is very authentic. I love their pizza. It reminds me of the pizza I had in Italy. I highly recommend this place if your looking for really good authentic food."}
{"text":"Wow! was looking for a place beside Verrazanos pizza for meatball sub which there's are ok, but wanted a change,well started reading reviews and came across a place with great reviews and closer to my home, so we decide to try it. So so glad we did even had there pizza and glad we did the flavor of there meatballs are amazing and there pizza is so so good n not greasy at all so glad we found this place will definitely be going back . Bye Verrazanos!; ("}
{"text":"if you like cheese, this place has got to be the cheesiest pizza parlor of them all! i ordered a personal pizza with added extra cheese, mushrooms, and pepperoni! quality of the pizza was definitely good and reminded me of new york style pizzas! however, i noticed the mushroom topping, unlike the cheese was a little skimpy. few mushrooms on the whole thing, but the crust and overall texture of the pizza was good. i ordered the garlic knot meatball sliders! the garlic knots were good. i liked the house made marinara. the knots were soft inside and flakey outside. i didn't care too much for the meatballs because they were too salty for my preferential tastes. but, i didn't regret getting them.   the delivery service was very quick & the young delivery boy was friendly. i did ask for a side of ranch and did not get it, so that was slightly disappointing. i'm gonna give this spot 4 stars for my first try. i think i'd definitely try it again sometime with my boyfriend or besties."}
{"text":"We stopped in for takeout. The girl who works behind the counter was super nice! It was around 3pm and there were quite a bit of people going in and out of this restaurant  (good sign!) We ordered 2 slices of pizza, pasta fagioli soup and a meatball parmigiana sub. Everything was good. Love that they sell pizza by the slice! I will return to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Just had the Pizza.. honestly it was nothing special. Im from NY and for them to represent NY pizza I expect it to be good but the flavor was ok but the dough part was not crispy at all. When you take a bite out of pizza you wanna feel a crunch on the bottom and I didn't feel it. I got a garlic knot with my order and that was actually really good. I guess the water really does make a difference when it comes to pizza"}
{"text":"One word...delicious. Service was attentative and great. I only wish I lived closer. Prices are really reasonable too."}
{"text":"Wow stopped while I was waiting for a script and really good pizza. The knots are awesome. Will stop in again"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and subs!!! Their lunch special is the best, half sub and a salad with garlic knots for under $6.00!! Family run business is very welcoming!!! I'm glad I live around the corner!!!"}
{"text":"I kept looking for good pizza, not common, or store bought pizza and my family and I found Frankie's!!! Is delicious ! I can't believe it tasted so good and the slices are so big!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, got two slices and a few knots. Knots were very good. Pizza by the slice is added toppings to a slice of pre cooked hand tossed cheese pizza. Tossed it in the oven and off we went. Pizza was pretty good and I would go back, if in the neighborhood. Think location kills this place, put it south of 215 and they would be crazy busy in my opinion. Going to have to try a whole fresh pie next time."}
{"text":"I initially tried Frankie's because it's walking distance from my house; I keep coming back to Frankie's because their food is soooooo gooooood.   My go to order is a Vegetable Pizza. I can smell it from upstairs the second it gets delivered to my house, and I come running down to have a slice while it's still hot. The fresh toppings make me almost feel like I'm eating healthy, but it's so delicious that it's definitely a treat.  My last order I went in the opposite direction because I had company and he's a Meat Lover's guy. But once again, the pie didn't disappoint. I even snuck the last pieces the next day before everyone got up, lol.  Long story short, you won't regret going here. The food is fresh, the quality is great, and you will definitely want more."}
{"text":"Ordered a cheese pizza. Perfect amount of cheese and sauce. Great taste! Also ordered a chicken parm sandwich. Excellent. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"So where my me and my wife are deciding what pizza place to stop by today and we decided to stop by Frankie's we lived in the area for more than 10 years yet never visited this pizza place. Truly are mistake, we arrived at 5:45 by 5:50 we had our order taken will simple pepperoni pizza the young lady behind the counter stated it would be 25 minutes. 15 minutes later we're walking out with a pizza. Get home pop open the pizza boz and taste, yeah we regret not visiting them earlier, really, really good pizza."}
{"text":"Food is good old Italian grub. Ordered a variety of stuff from their menu and they were all great. The messy hot subs are just outstanding - the sausage and peppers and the Philly cheese steak are winners. The pasta is also excellent - spaghetti and meatballs and baked ziti are . Also love the garlic knots. Next time we'll try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Very tasty for fast pizza!  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish they delivered to Inspirada and I didn't have to drive to go get it.  The places that do deliver to Inspirada are definitely not as good as Frankie's.  The Meat Lover's is delish!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and must say that I love the big size serving of their pizza and LOVE LOVE THEIR GARLIC KNOTS! Awesome service and love the staff! My new FAV pizza spot."}
{"text":"This place I discovered on a lunch break right down the street from my hospital. I cannot tell you how obsessed i am! The atmosphere is very Italian east coast pizzeria. Meaning, they get loud with each-other, talk loud.. and its absolutely amazing! This is one of the only places i've found in LV that sells pizza by the slice. Very family oriented place. Please do not be discouraged by walking in and hearing a little \"bickering\" just laugh it off and enjoy the wonderful food!   Ps: try the pinwheel! Its a great price at $3.00  Also the garlic knots...  Know what... just try the whole menu, i promise you that you will come back religiously & tell everyone about it as i do..."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were immediately greeted, very friendly cashier. The atmosphere was very inviting. We ordered the Philly Cheese Steak, Meatball sliders, and garlic knots. They were wonderful. Been going their ever since."}
{"text":"My fiancé & I LOVE this restaurant! The pizza, salads & garlic knots are always great!! We used to eat here all the time before we moved away from this side of town. It's a nice, really well run family restaurant, and the service is always Awesome. Victoria is an amazing employee, she is always very sweet & makes sure your order is perfect. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The best New York pizza I've ever had on the West Coast. Fantastically good tasting crisp thin and authentic. Very affordable as well I got a large pizza with a whole bunch of stuff on it and it cost me $20 delivered and I believe I even got a soda pop 2 liter with it."}
{"text":"Ok so my parents invited my husband and I for dinner was there for the first time this evening , dine in , my parents ranting about the pizza  and Stromboli that it's delicious and a must have , well they are indeed correct. Will be back for more ."}
{"text":"I so so wanted to rate his place a 5 like the 5 stars I saw in their overall review, especially after the pleasant phone conversation I had ordering my pick up,  but my foodie conscious could not sadly. There is soooo much potential there though, I must say. I ordered a margarita pizza, garlic knots, and penne marinara to go. There was a little wait but no big deal, I was taking in the environment since it was my first time trying this place. The vibe was very warm and welcoming, and the place (I assume) is family owned because it has that little something extra that bigger restaurants can't replicate. The food I ordered was not bad by any means, but it came in under my expectations. The marinara sauce was a little runny with the (perfectly cooked) penne and garlic knots needed a little more seasoning-even for me and I usually do very light seasoning if any. The margarita pizza crust was amazing though! So crispy and not soggy, thin like NY pizza. (Could have used much more basil but that's me). If that sauce was a little heartier, I thing that pizza would have been superb. Definitely will come back and try again maybe a couple months down the road. 4 stars because of that \"little something extra\" this place possesses."}
{"text":"My husband and I were trying to find a good pizza place to eat we were coming from California and looked on Yelp and it had good reviews . So we stopped at Frankies Pizza and it was delicious! The pizza was cooked perfectly and so were the garlic knots. The staff was very friendly and funny. Good job to Frankies Pizza when I come back to Vegas I will be sure to stop by and grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"just moved to the area. came here because my yelp app told me to. i trust a 5 star review average. ordered the veggie pizza and a couple of slices of cheese pizza for my daughter. enjoyed a garlic knot while i was waiting.  loved the sign that said:  *****beware*****  real italian cooking is going on in this kitchen. at any moment, screaming, arguing, yelling, cursing and other normal activities associated with italian cooking could break out. please just sit back, relax and most importantly, enjoy the food!  which we did and i will be back as i need to try the white pizza and the eggplant rollatini."}
{"text":"The pies are really good here.  Lot's to choose from.  The meatball sliders are freakin' amazing!  A little on the pricier side for pizza but you do get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I too am a neighborhood local. After reading the reviews, we decided to try Frankie's. We ordered take out on a Friday night. We ordered pizza, of course, meatball sliders and a cannoli. Everything was sooo delicious!!! I cannot wait to go back to try more of the menu. We definitely found our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a few times. The pizza is ok but nice and cheap. The wings are strange. They don't resemble the usual hot wings."}
{"text":"$5.99 for a New York slice, a considerably large side salad, soda, AND a bonus garlic knot? Can't be right...  Not only is it right, it's pretty darn good. Wouldn't say it's anywhere near the best pizza I've ever had, especially by NY standards, but it sure hits the spot when you're hangry. Plus the value of that special is just cray.  Gotta say this will be one of my neighborhood staples when I really can't decide. Family vibe atmosphere with super nice staff who give great service, especially when you opt to dine in. Glad Frankie and the crew are nearby."}
{"text":"Amazing! Being East Coasters... My wife & I are completely burned out from looking & trying these \"NY STYLE\" pizza joints.   We search NO MORE! The search is OVER! We are home again! Amazing service, food, portions, quality, atmosphere, etc.   They're even child friendly. Balls of pizza dough for them to play with!   The cook \"Frankie\".... 2 words... AMAZING COOK! Knows NY crust & cooks it VERY well. And his chicken parmesan was killer too!   WILL DEFINITELY BE RETURNING FOR MORE!!"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous!!! The Margarita pizza was awesome. The crust was perfectly made and cooked!!! The authentic ricotta cannoli were so delicious!!! Will definitely be order again... soon!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for homemade Italian food, Frankie's Pizza is the place to go. From their antipasta salad to their cannoli's you won't be disappointed! Chicken wings - amazing. Garlic knots - yummy. Stromboli - REALLY good... and enough for 2 at a GREAT price. Pizza - perfectly made and so many toppings to chose from. Baked Penne - so good. Chicken Parmesan Dinner - awesome. So much more to try and we will definitely be back! Give them a try."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Town!!!! I tried the Margherita Pizza and the Baked Penne Pasta. Both were very delicious and they tasted authentic."}
{"text":"amazing!!!!!! We ordered  pizza garlic knots and veggie wrap everything was so good. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. We will for sure be back. This is definitely not your average pizza place it's so much more  if you haven't tried this place it's a must!!!!"}
{"text":"Best local pizza joint in Henderson, everything is fresh and quickly made. Everyone here is super friendly and tentative. My top picks is the margarita and great white pizza but you really cant go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Cozy spot, good smells from the kitchen and the pizza is great. Toothsome and tasty. None of that high brow so popular today just good food for watching a game or a movie."}
{"text":"I have been searching tirelessly for GOOD NY pizza here in the desert. I do believe that the search is over. First of all the place is owned by NEW YORKERS!!! Italian NYers at that. And it's family run. We were warmly greeted when we came in by Victoria. She is friendly and answered questions about the menu. My hubby and I each got one of the specials: I got the slice, salad, & drink, hubs got the 2 slices and a drink. The salad was perfect in size and not just ice burg lettuce and a few cherry tomatoes, nope, romaine cukes, olives and cut up tomatoes. The ranch dressing was thick and creamy. Now for the pizza...where do I start? I could tell by looking at it that it was perfect. The problem with pizza here is that it's limp. The crust tends to be, well, soggy. NOT here! The crust is thin & crisp. The sauce is perfectly seasoned, not over powering and the cheese was perfectly melted. Let's not forget the oil. Good NY pizza has a crunch and drips with olive oil. This has it in spades. Hubby got pepperoni, mine was plain cheese. The icing on the cake were the complimentary garlic knots! Baled to perfection and served on a nifty tin bucket with a side of marinara. Victoria chatted with us and made us few right at home. The hubby made a point of telling the guys making the food how great everything was. Perfecto & delicioso!! Frankie's Pizza is an amazing gem in the Silverado Ranch neighborhood. I am looking forward to going back and trying the Vodka Penne and the cannoli. And they deliver!!! But go in! I promise, you won't be disappointed. Especially if you're from NY, NJ, or Boston. This place is the real deal. And their menu is now on my fridge, not in a drawer. MANGÉ!!"}
{"text":"Frankie's refused to honor this coupon. First, they claimed it was printed by accident and wasn't supposed to be distributed. I told them that I live around the corner and am looking for a neighborhood pizza place, would love to give them a try. They continued to refuse, and claimed that the coupon must be expired, because they stopped distributing the offer after early July. As printed, the coupon is clearly good through October.   Wish I could eat here because everyone seems to rave about the food, but when a business has a chance to earn a new customer and chooses to be dishonest and uncompromising, I refuse to support that business."}
{"text":"Looked for pizza delivery on a Friday night for my daughter and her friends. Not wanting Dominos, I noticed Frankie's was 5 out of 5 stars, pretty impressive. I called and was greeted with a chipper female who was friendly and explained different pizza options.  I wanted delivery and it being a Friday night, the time for delivery st my door would have been about an hour. I decided to drive over in the 25 minutes she said it'd be to prepare the pizzas and pick them up. I drove over and arrived 25 minutes after my call, pizza were hot and ready. Total for a large cheese and a medium BBQ chicken was $23.  Interior is small, only a handful of tables, but looks newly remodeled with black tiled counter and wall. Pizza, calzone, stromboli, salads and pastas are available.  Arriving home and the kids happy to eat, I sampled a bite of each, both were very good.  Think I may have found our new pizza place."}
{"text":"We were really craving some pizza. Just cheese sounded like just the right thing. The reviews here look great. NY style is one of the best ever, and it seemed like this was just the place. Pictures look great.   Ordered pickup and it was ready right on time. The interior looks great. Smells wonderful in here too. Everyone was friendly. There were garlic knots on display, and they did look tempting. But I hate to say it...I have never had a garlic knot. Maybe one day.   Took our pizza home and dug in. Very underwhelming. We both really wanted to love this pizza, but just couldn't. The crust was thin, but not thin enough. There was no 'grease' sitting on top of the cheese. Yeah, that is a thing, and it was missing. And the sauce was boring. There was no tanginess to it, no depth of flavor.   Although the staff was great, the place looked nice and clean, it is close to home...will not be coming back for their pizza. I am sad."}
{"text":"Family Owned and operated as the only way to do a business right in my personal opinion, this family is top notch and the food that they create is amazing! Stop by and say Hi to Vito, Paula, Frankie and the girls, you won't be disappointed... Garlic knots are the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza and wonderful service. The calzones are the absolute best in Vegas! Reminds me of the family pizza places back in NY. They also have great specials."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great price. Lunch special is good. Family owned and ran. We really enjoyed the food and service. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the neighborhood. Costs me extra to get it through Grub Hub, but it's worth it. Better cheese, better pepperoni, better sauce, good crust that I actually want to eat. I have also tried the Philly cheesesteak sandwich. It is a quality roast beef sandwich on quality bread, but it didn't really register as a \"Philly.\" Just a roast beef sandwich. So I don't bother with the sandwiches. I only get the pizza."}
{"text":"One of my good friends introduced me to Frankie's Pizza now I'm hooked the  food is delicious everything tastes fresh I'm so glad I finally found a place that the food tastes like back home in New York . The garlic knots are not overpowering with garlic, the food is made just right not too much salt or pepper . I was talking to the owner he told me if you call a head of time they can even make Grandma Pizza and they can make  Sicilian. I can't wait to go back and try The Garlic Knot meatball sliders and the eggplant rollatini. And let's not forget the chocolate cake and their cannolis."}
{"text":"My girlfriend visited this restaurant with our three kids today. She stated the food was excellent and service was extremely friendly and great. Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place because all of the positive Yelp reviews. I'm glad I did. I'm from New York and love chicken parmesan. Such a simple dish yet so hard to find a good one here in Las Vegas. I think I did. The young lady at the front cash register was was very pleasant and accommodating... the only negative thing is that the two meals i ordered did not include salad dressing which kinda left me in a bind but things happen."}
{"text":"$6+ lunch special AND you get a garlic knot! The area has needed a legit East Coast pizza joint (no offense to others) with legit Long Islanders running the biz.   While it's not exactly New York style to a T, and using my scale of Las Vegas pizza with Bonnano's ranked closest to good NYC street pizza, Frankie's is up there.  Their pizza is foldable. Their specials come with a soda. Their service is quick and dirty.  I've also had their lasanga and their pinwheels... A LOT OF FOOD.   Their menu is extensive, prices decent, and they aren't SUPER crowded during lunch.. but expect a brief wait for your food.  They also cater!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out tonight and sure glad we did! The place is located next to Diversity tattoo and piercing. I was surprised with the modern updated decor - I was not expecting how nice and classy it was. Small space with some nice seats and very easy to read menu. Many options to choose from( salads, calzones,pizza,wings,subs. They even had some daily specials . We decided on two pizzas and wings to go.. They were so nice and even offered us water while we waited for our order! That is true hospitality!  Pizza was Amazing!  They use fresh pizza sauce and give you a good amount of blue cheese dressing for wings. So good will defenelty be back !"}
{"text":"About time I found some good NY pizza and calzon. the salads are great to.................."}
{"text":"They have Italian ice now! The lemon was slightly sweet and very refreshing. The chocolate was also delicious!"}
{"text":"We read reviews and decided to order is right down the street from our house.  We got meat lovers we picked it up, girl was very nice when we arrived.  Pizza was hot and lots of toppings, the sauce was amazing and so was crust. Definately will be our go to pizza place.  Price was great only $18 bucks for 16\"pizza."}
{"text":"The bae and I are vegetarian so we always deepthroat the eggplant parm sandwich! I mean take a look at it!! YOU'D DEEPTHROAT IT TOO!!"}
{"text":"The family which runs the business is a big reason to come in. They know food! They are true Italians and make it the way New York City is known for. The pizza is made fresh and does not use store bought junk. There menu selection is top notch and if you want the best, get the Eggplant Parm. No question on where I'm going back to, Frankie's only."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, this is the first five star review I've given while having a complaint. Why? The pizza was THAT good. I scheduled a delivery and they showed up 20 min late.... but it was worth the wait. I even tried the gluten free pizza, and it was the best one I've ever tasted. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We had lunch delivered to my office for about 8 of us.  Everyone got a lunch special which was $5.99 each (that included the drink and a garlic knot-amazing!). The choices were a half sandwich and salad, a piece of pizza and salad, or 2 pieces of pizza.  I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich with salad. Everything was delicious, from the sandwich to the knot with the red dipping sauce and right down to the Italian dressing for the salad. This is enough to fill anyone with and appetite. It even came with nicely napkin wrapped utensils. The food was delivered on time and the delivery girl was super sweet! Great food and a bargain."}
{"text":"Frankie's is the very very VERY best pizza in Vegas hands down. Best food, service is impeccable, best specials, and the complimentary garlic knots are truly the most delightful tasty knots you will ever try. This place is addicting. We drive 35 minutes each way just to come here and pretty regularly I might add. We love this joint! Thank you Frankie's for being so full of awesomeness!!"}
{"text":"Got the 2  slices + drink combo, comes with a garlic knot.  Good pizza and good Garlic knot(s)! They give pretty decent sized slices too! The girl that helped me was very friendly, so had no trouble there."}
{"text":"My new go-to place for Strombolis and pizza! Not only is the staff super nice, but the food is delicious!! Didn't know what to expect since most places serve them on the smaller side so I asked about ordering pizza by the slice, the kind lady was honest and said it could feed me and my girlfriend so we decided not to get a slice for me. At the end when the food was ready we were told they were giving us a complimentary slice of Grandmas pizza(the pizza we asked about), which is essentially the sauce on top of the cheese. Safe to say it was absolutely delicious and I'm thankful for their generosity. Stromboli was phenomenal, grandmas pizza was delicious, and the staff, the staff was the icing on the cake. Definitely will be back and will recommend to friends and family. And if YOU decide to stop by ask for grandmas pizza. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Stay far away from this place  unless you're looking for under cooked pasta with jarred tomato sauce. Looked and tasted like Prego or Ragu. Very disappointed, Especially for the price you'd think the quality would be a lot better since they advertise homemade sauce"}
{"text":"The kind and caring service of the family here. The little things like the chef, Frankie Jr., bringing out my food. The great prices. & the Quality QUALITY QUALITY of the food here!! I can't stress it enough. You can tell everyone here takes pride in their business. Now I know why my fiancé comes here for lunch 99% of the time! Thank you guys"}
{"text":"Like all the other Yelpers, went to visit this pizza place because of all the good reviews. I was not disappointed. Meat lovers pizza was perfect and filled with toppings, family owned business from Long Island, where I am from was amazing and friendly. Garlic Knots came with dinner free of charge and were excellent. Glad I went with other yelpers and gave this place a try."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how DELICIOUS everything is here!!!!  From the perfected marinara sauce, to the exquisite meats used on the pizza...I'm definitely a new lifelong customer! Customer service is top notch too!  Absolutely fantastic family owned business!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best pizza places I've been to in a long time. The staff is so friendly and the food is delicious! I had the Mozerella sticks, pinwheels and a pizza. The pinwheels are the greatest thing I've ever had. Pepperoni, cheese and their Marinara sauce, with a crispy top. It was amazing. They don't deliver in my area but it's no problem having to go to their location to eat. The food is so good."}
{"text":"They never disappoint. The pizza is always amazing and their eggplant is delicious. I haven't found any place with good eggplant since I've moved out here. It's by far my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!!!!  Family ran and owned. They are so sweet!!! Greatest service. Can't say enough good things.  The ingredients were so fresh and the food was hot. We had the pizza, calzone, and garlic knots. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Frankie's Pizza is in the same business district as I work, so I thought what the heck lets give them a try.   I glanced at the menu and the pizza by the slice caught my eye. They give you a good amount of food, two slices of pizza with a side of garlic knots and a drink for $7. The pizza tastes delicious, it's cheesy, hot and crispy with hearty portions of pepperoni and sausage. They also make meatball sliders on garlic knots which I never heard of but it's amazing, especially when it's dipped in marinara sauce.   Frankie's Pizza is a family run business with a nice and courteous staff. I notice when people walk in they are pleased to stop by and that makes me feel it's a cool place to have to pizza.  I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"I do have one issue which I discovered this past Sunday when I called to order Pizza for Football. Closed Sunday's. I had to order from Verrazanos which is good but would love to see Frankies open on Sundays as that seems to be the day I order Pizza the most during Football season."}
{"text":"We have had their pizza on three occasions. It has been good each time. The pepperoni is just greasy enough and they put the right amount of cheese. The kids especially love the garlic knots.  It's a quaint place that offers a few tables for dinning in.  It's definitely worth checking out the next time your in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"You want great food that is homemade. Frankie's is where you scratch this itch. The subs are so good we haven't even tried the pizza yet. Excellent eggplant , chicken parmesan is made properly and not some defrosted frozen Frankenstein patty like most places give you. Salad actually has something in it besides iceburg lettuce. Cheap lunch specials! Spaghetti is great, portion sizes are generous.  Super friendly owners, nice decor even. Just go there...!!! :)"}
{"text":"I was new to town and hate ordering from corporate chains. It doesn't bode well when your primary responsibility is to shareholders rather than paying customers. Frankie's was recommended to me and I wasn't disappointed! Good, foldable, ny style pizza. There was something different about the sauce, good different. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone fed up with the generic, bland corporate options"}
{"text":"I work in the same business center as Frankie's and everyone in my office loves this place. At least one person in our office places an order daily. Their food is delicious, their prices are so affordable and they really are great people!!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing. Me and my wife got personal pizzas and garlic knots. The knots were absolutely amazing. The sauce they serve with it is delicious. The pizza was absolute perfection! This has just become our new go to pizza place. Incredibly fast delivery. 10/10"}
{"text":"This is hands down our favorite Pizza Spot! My family loves this place!  The family that owns this place has a giant heart and treats everyone that walks through their doors like they are part of the fam. Customer service is always a soo good in here!   We love that everything is fresh, as soon as you walk in the smell makes your mouth water. I cannot get over their garlic knots. They are my favorite and I would swing by just for that!"}
{"text":"The pizza was very good, but the chicken parm sandwich was just okay and a small portion"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good pizza, our crust was a little burnt. But, luckily I don't eat the crust. Would recommend, a family of 4 could not finish a 16 inch pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza made fast, friendly staff, great prices! Everything is fresh!  They seriously hook the food up here. Everything is always LOADED with fresh ingredients. I've become a regular here. A quality pizza that can feed 2-3 people for under $20 and ready for pickup in 20 minutes or less? I'm in! A great neighborhood option.  I like the Hawaiian best. I tried their meat lover pizza once and if you order that, you better LOVE meat because they load it up so much that it was actually too much meat for me! Their salads are well made also, unlike a lot of pizza places.  Girls working the phones and front counter are always friendly (and cute)! I'm happy to support this family owned business. Keep up the good work guys! Maybe add a few more pizza configurations to the menu sometime soon?"}
{"text":"Very good and friendly service!! There were the right amount of toppings on the pizza. I prefer my crust thinner than the pizza I got to go.  I asked for the pizza to be well done and I would say the pizza appeared to be cooked longer than the others I saw while I was waiting on my food.  I ordered a Caesars salad with Italian dressing. the salad was very fresh and the dressing was very good.  I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"What I like about Frankie's pizza the most is they think of the little things. We ordered a meatball sub with side salad a large pizza with meatballs and half mushrooms and spinach. The meatball sub came with an extra side of sauce and came with a complementary garlic rolls and sauce as well. I like that we didn't have to ask for extra sauce for any of our items as it was already provided.   Wings were nice and spicy. And still crispy.  The pizza crust was thin and crispy all the ingredients seem very fresh and the meatballs were amazing. Customer service was really nice and friendly and the food came out very fast. Thank you Frankie we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and very affordable. The crust well done just how I like it. When you go don't forget to order the garlic knots.... complimentary if you dine in."}
{"text":"So, I'm a pizza snob. I'm 90% certain I could live off of the stuff if I had a stomach of steal and couldn't get fat. Anywho, I decided to call in for Pickup a few days ago because of the amazing reviews for this place. Also, I'm ALWAYS down for discovering new pizza places.   Always.  We ordered the pizza online through Eat24 and went to pick it up at the designated time. The place is kind of easy to miss, since the plaza it's in is pretty massive. Frankie's is attached to the Village Pub, so that helps to know. I spent entirely to long trying to look for it, lol.    The place itself is super clean. My husband and I were greeted at the door when we arrived and served promptly. The woman at the counter was friendly and we were served in a very timely manner. A+ Customer Service.  The reason for the 3 star, is the pizza itself. So. The price for the amount of pizza you get is pretty nice. It was $18.00 for a Meat Lovers, and with tip/tax it came to about $22 for a 16 inches. Okay, I can live with that. The pizza itself, was thin crust, with a plethora of meat on it. The meat tasted good, but nothing out of the ordinary, the crust was what one would expect from a thin crust, but once again, nothing out of the ordinary. That basically sums up the whole pizza. Not great, not horrible, just good. Definitely a cut (haha) above \"fast food\" pizza.  Would I eat here again? Maybe, if I was in the neighborhood and wanted pizza. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it, though. It was solid, but there are definitely better pizza places out there."}
{"text":"As a native of New Jersey, I found it extremely difficult to find a great pizza place when I moved to Vegas over 20 years ago.  I can say this no longer, Frankie's Pizza is by far the best pizza place in town.  Eggplant pizza and the Buffalo chicken pizza are fabulous....   Eating there brought back the memories of back East.  THANK YOU FRANKIE AND FAMILY."}
{"text":"Pros: Friendly service, generous toppings, fair prices, nice seating area  Cons: Wings are made with tomato sauce, better local pizza place down the street. No website.  I love to try new restaurants and support local businesses. This place has great reviews on Yelp, but sometimes this can be misleading with new businesses (friends/family inflating reviews). The staff are great and I would really like to see this place do well, but the pizza industry in Vegas/Henderson is VERY competitive  The pizza is better than most, but is not as good as a another local place nearby. The wings were dissapointing, because I was expecting a buffalo style wing. Their version was stewed or baked in a spicy tomato sauce. Not bad, but I wouldn't have ordered them if they provided this information on their Yelp menu.  I hope that they make improvements with time. I would be willing to try again some day."}
{"text":"Best meatball sub I've had. My wife got the Italian sub and loved it. The garlic knots were really good but the sauce made them outstanding"}
{"text":"Great Salad. Fantastic \"by the slice specials\" with a beverage. Great sandwiches, Friendly people,  Fresh ingredients, good cheese. I don't know what else you can ask for!  Like everybody else I loved the garlic knots. I do wish they were open a little later because I always think about going there and its already after 8. A true Gem!  Price legend should be $ not $$  You can walk out completely satisfied for under $10 per person easily."}
{"text":"Had the lunch combo best fuckin Philly cheese steak sandwich I ever ate salad is so fresh also didn't get to go inside but my mom said their customer service is awesome I stay north  but it will be worth the drive I'll most definitely will be back good job Frankies two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great customer service! There very nice people, my last delivery was late and I really didn't even notice. When they got here my pizza was free, I even had to twist the guys arm to give him a tip."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try since it's across the street from my Dentist's office. My husband and I had the garlic knots and the meat lovers pizza. Absolutely AWESOME food and the service was excellent. Almost makes me want to go to the dentist more often just so I can eat here again. Ok, not really, but this place ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Ok this is an awesome pizza spot! I love the egg plant Parmesan.  So good. You'll burn your tongue eating the egg plant. The garlic knots are the best. I drink the sauce! It's so yummy."}
{"text":"The chicken parm sandwich is to die for!!! The chicken is so juice. The pizza was fantastic; loved the sauce and the fact they load up the toppings! My new favorite pizza shop!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. Not enough sauce in my opinion. It had almost none. But it had generous thick slices of sausage which is good. I waited 35 minutes which is weird because pizza shouldn't be in the oven for more than 6-7 minutes. So I don't know what they were doing for those extra 25-30 minutes while I waited in the seating area. I would expect 35 minutes for delivery but this was not delivery. I was the only one there.  I might go there again. If I do, I'll call ahead."}
