{"text":"Kniblets is in the building I work.  For $5, tax in you can get a warm lunch, a salad or a wrap.  Sure - their baking may be wrapped once or twice a week but they're not a bakery - they are a lunch place and by far one of the cheapest ones in the downtown core."}
{"text":"They are in my building where I work as well.  The Friday roti is amazing, and at $5.75, you won't find anything better.  Also, they make an incredible western omlet/sandwich.  The coffee is average, but I have always found the staff very friendly, and the food very good.  Clearly a lot of other people feel similarly, as there is always a line up at lunch.  Given the low price point, they deserve five stars in my book. Great job girls!  (in contrast, you could always go to the other restaurant in the same building and pay $14 for tiny, greasy portions, which is probably why you don't ever see a line up there).  The only drawback is that they are a cash only operation, though there is a bank machine immediately beside the cafe."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good lunch downtown on a budget come here!
It is usually packed which is a testament on the value that this place provides. You get a lot of food for the price you pay and the food is quite good too. 
It is a regular lunch stop for me!"}
{"text":"Love the selection and quality at Kniblets! Best value choice for lunch in the financial district, huge portions for $4-$7! Menu changes daily with options like lasagna, schnitzel, sweet and sour chicken, chicken bulgogi, fish fillets, jerk chicken, shepherds pie, and so much more! They also have sandwiches, salads, wraps and snacks!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible, bacon is pre-cooked.

They tried to sell me a rock disguised as a brownie."}
{"text":"A Hidden gem found in the Financial District. This family run take out spot offers fast and fresh breakfast, sandwiches and hearty comfort food during the week. 

The line up before 9am and noon gets quite long but definitely worth the wait because its so cheap. 

For $3.25, order the \"breakfast special\". You choose your bread that comes with egg, cheese and bacon. Get the pesto Mayo!

Sandwiches run around $4.00.

For $5.25, you can get a chicken wrap or jerk chicken on salad. They serve roti on Fridays but I would rather go to a Caribbean place for that."}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away in the financial district.  At lunchtimes you can find a queue of workers lined up to grab themselves some lunch to eat at their desks.  

The food is very nice and affordable.  The jerk chicken is very mild, but look at where they are, right?  The chicken adobo is always a generous serving, and the staff get the customers served and out the door rapidly.  

If you're nearby this is one of the best venues you can find to grab yourself some lunch."}
{"text":"When I used to work in the area, Kniblets was my go-to place for cheap and homemade lunches. I found this place probably 4 years after working in the area! It's hidden inside the building behind the Canada Post. The food is like what you'll make at home for yourself, nothing authentic but appears to be put together with whatever they have on hand. They're consistent about that too. The jerk chicken with yellow rice was my favourite dish, adding more protein or a salad was reasonable too. It doesn't taste like jerk chicken though, but it was still delicious. They regularly have noodles, shepherd's pie, Chinese chicken (similar to general tso), and roti on Fridays. For the morning crowds/sandwich crowds, they have an assortment of bagels and pitas as well!"}
{"text":"Tucked away from the public, this place is a great find. The food is delicious, but what you expect. Nothing will blow you away but you'll be completely satisfied. The one person who will definitely be happy is your wallet. This place has got to be one of the best value breakfast and lunch spots in the city. Wraps and omelettes for under $5, such a steal !"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in this building for work, I smell wonderful aromas - decided to pop by to see if the flavours lived up to the smells. 

Lineup was massive - at least 20 people waiting for food.  Usually a very good sign.

Had the jerk chicken and a can of pop - $6.50 taxes in.  You wont find anything at all in the downtown core that can compete at the price point.  Quality of the food was very good.  The chicken itself was stellar, and on par with a number of good Jamaican food restaurants in the city.  It all needed some salt, but that's really nitpicky.  For that price, unbelievable value.  Definitely will be going again, and bringing friends."}
