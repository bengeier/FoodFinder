{"text":"I ordered food from here using Foodora.

What I found good about my order:
-it looks appetizing, the rolls are nicely made
-they are generous with the fish, unlike places that slice their fish so thin you can see it
-the avocado was right, just perfect, not brown or unripe
-I especially enjoyed my tuna hosomaki, the nigiri sushi, and the maki dragon

Why it lost a star 1:
-it is on the pricier side: 3 rolls and a combo B cost almost $70, mind you if I ate at the restaurant it would have cost the same with tip added, which is still a little steep for a sushi place I want to frequent at least 1 a week
-the rice was on the sweeter side, but it's not that noticeable when eating the rolls
-the futomaki dynamite roll which had crab meat tasted off

Overall, I'd still recommend this place and would most likely order here again sticking to the rolls. I'd also want to give the sashimi a try too."}
{"text":"Why are there no reviews for this amazing place? My friend and I went last night and it was empty but we really wanted ramen so we decided to give it a try, we got the chicken ramen bowl, AMAZING. We loved it so much that we went again today.  When we went today it was completely packed, so many people going and coming and sitting and enjoying. I got the chicken ramen bowl AGAIN and the California rolls. I'm going to miss this place when I go back to NY. Affordable price, great food, lots of choices.  Staff is super friendly and very quick service. If you want good food definitely come here"}
{"text":"Decent take out sushi set in a fast food manner. A little pricey for how many pieces they give you, but it was tasty for what they had."}
{"text":"If you're looking to get a sushi lunch box, then this is the place. The sushi are okay, but they do give you a free cup of soup with your lunch, which is a nice gesture. Overall, it's a good place to grab a quick lunch take out or have lunch there."}
