{"text":"Had Rainbow trout cooked with a balsamic glaze which was a decent combination. They have a pretty nice specialty drink list and the service was good."}
{"text":"What can I say my fianc√©e and I simply loved this restaurant.  We have eaten at other more expensive seafood restaurants but this one is as good, if not better, and overall we found the prices to be very reasonable.  Our appetizer, crab stuffed mushrooms, was very tasty.  The crab cakes were some of the best we have ever had....delicious!!  I had the almond encrusted tilapia that was in banana butter which I really liked.  We will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"I had the Octoberfest pork chop special with the spaetzle and it was awesome.  Extremely flavorful, and a fair portion side.there were two smaller chops grilled to perfection.    My wife had the seafood rotolo special and it was just ok. They paired the rotolo (basically a large seafood stuffed noodle) with a ariate and it was terrible. The rotolo itself was packed full of seafood, and was delicious but the ariate absolutely detracted from the dish. I would have rather had the rotolo served with ketchup than the tomato paste they called ariate sauce.  We ate the meal and informed the waiter our opinion  and he was argumentative about it. But whatever.  All and all a solid dining experience, a bit high priced with fair portion sides but not phenomenal. I would come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Very nice seafood selection.  Always busy but the food is excellent.  Fried shrimp is always very good.  Lenten special of shrimp and scallop dumpling soup was very creamy and nice.  Salad is nice.  I felt the creamy lemon dressing would definitely be something I would come back for.  Not a great location if looking for an intimate night out for two."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here a couple of times a year. My first experience was great and weirdly made me feel like I was in the Outer Banks. I do feel like I am less impressed with each visit. Our last visit was 2 weeks ago and it was nothing to remember. I would go back mainly because of their crab cakes, they are amazing. I always hold out hope that we will get that great feeling we got on our first visit. We are creatures if habit. I think the prices are fair and the portions adequate."}
{"text":"Best part of dinner was the mojito and fresh fish entrees.  I had the parmesean crusted halibut (yum!) and my boyfriend had swordfish in a mango cajun sauce (also really good).    Aside from that, the decor was a bit shabbier than I expected and they played 80's music like Freeze Frame.  Bread was totally boring - white cold loaf and dipping oil that was pretty tasteless.  Salad was run of the mill and dressing tasted bottled.    Service was good except for one very important part.  When the waitress brought the food, my boyfriend and I both had empty cocktails.  She took an order for another round, but we did not receive them until our food was almost gone.  It was very uncomfortable to eat 75% of a meal with no drink.  My complements to the chef that prepared the entrees, but I won't be rushing back because of everything else."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night and I was overall impressed with Capstone Grill. They do not take reservations but you can call ahead and get on a waiting list. We went early so we were seated right away. Our waitress, Rachel S. was WONDERFUL. She quickly took our orders, checked on us often but was never a bother, drinks kept full and plates cleared quickly. We got the lobster, crab cakes and ichiban appetizer and it was all very good. My husband had the English Style (lightly breaded) Halibut and I had the Mahi Mahi with a honey mango sauce. All around great food, the fish was very fresh but there could have been a little more flavor in the sauces. I though the honey mango sauce was pretty bland but the fish was so good it didn't matter. Dessert was an almond torte that was also good. We had gone out the week before to Cure and had HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service (wonderful food though) so it was nice to have a great server. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"One of the best choices in the area. The crab cakes at Capstone are the only ones I am willing to eat. Big chunks of lump crab, loosely packed and with very little binding - you actually get to taste the crab and not a giant mess of vaguely seafoody, deep fried gunk.   The crab dip was also good, very cheesy with a ton of crab. Lots of fish, decent steak, add on seafood options for entrees.  I've never had problems with service.  It can get busy, but I haven't had to wait more than a few minutes."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here as a spur of the moment 'lets have a date night' after our Chiropractor visit. Having driven by the Capstone Grill numerous times my fiance and I decided to try it out. The exterior is unpretentious upscale and the interior was elegantly simple. We enjoy eating at the bar top when it is just us but always wait for the host(ess) to seat us or point us in the right direction. Upon walking into Capstone the hostess was hunched over the greeting table? Hostess table? On the landline. We waited for her to at least raise her eyes to acknowledge out presence. When she started smiling into the phone I realized she wasn't taking an order or a reservation but was having a personal conversation. I eventually said if its all right to seat ourselves at the bar and we got a head nod. As we were sitting down my fiance said 'look around' and we realized other than one other couple the average age of the clientele was 65 or so... Not often we feel like the young people in the room. After getting our menu we discussed going to another restaurant due to the high costs of the meal but ultimately we decided to split a meal and hope that it would be enough and worth the cost. The bartender was very good with giving us the nightly specials. We ultimately decided on their Octoberfest German Pork Chops and had a split up charge that allowed us to get an extra soup and side and added a Ceasar salad. I got the German potato soup that was very creamy and would of been better with bacon or pork added. My fiance got the New England Clam Chowder that was awesome (being the great guy he is he let me have half of it). The bread awesome with their olive oil spread. The pork chops came out on separate plates (which was also really nice) and ultimately was okay. It wasn't anything that we couldn't of made easily if not better at home. My fiance remind me that we ordered off the German menu and most likely it doesn't reflect the typical meal there. I was worried about the cost but to our happy surprise with two draft beers, a surcharge for the split plates, an added salad, and the meal (that was plenty for two people) the cost was only 35 dollars.  Other than the rude hostess and the twilight years clientele I enjoyed the restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't get to the South Hills much anymore but we were happy to see Capstone thriving on a Sat night even with several new options in the area. Always liked it here. Our dinners were excellent, as was the service even though it was packed."}
{"text":"Went on a date with my hubby last night. This was our first time at Capstone. I have a really hard time getting him to try new places, so this was a success just because he got something new and enjoyed it!  We had the bruschetta as an appetizer. It came with a basil aiolli...this is a big YUCK for my hubby (won't eat ANYTHING creamy!), so the waitress kindly returned it to the kitchen and brought us a fresh one...delicious!  I had the sea scallops with the blackened Cajun spice! They were cooked to perfection and I LOVED the heat from the Cajun spices. I had a side salad (very generous portion) and sauteed Brussels sprouts with baby carrots. For dessert I had a raspberry and peach filled white cake...everything was fantastic if a little pricey.  My husband had the sea bass with the rosemary lemon vinaigrette recommended by the server. He had the pasta and side salad as well. For dessert he chose the carrot cake. He thoroughly enjoyed the sea bass, said the pasta was okay, it didn't WOW him, and he thought the carrot cake was a little dry.  Loved the atmosphere and the service was impeccable. We've had larger portions and more filling options at other restaurants for less money, but we will probably return to try the crab cakes and filet because we heard a lot of good things about those particular menu items."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim on a Friday night. The place is very small and congested. Every table is literally only a foot away from another table. You see and hear everything. Even getting up and trying to use the bathroom is challenge . The food was mediocre at best. I had the seafood pasta. The sauce was watered down to a point where it looked like clear liquid in some places on my dish.  No flavor at all. The service was very slow but friendly. Not a pleasurable dining experience."}
{"text":"I always like to visit Capstone when I'm in the area.  I have never had better crabcakes ANYWHERE.  They are the best here with very little filler.  Always light and broiled perfectly.  My recent experience on a Friday evening  found the food to be consistently good.  The atmosphere has become rather stodgy, subdued and boring, in my opinion.  In days past, there was a fun and friendly atmosphere at Capstone.  The waite staff were friendlier and more engaged and the patrons were always a nice mix of folks enjoying an evening out.  Last night the place was rather empty (for a Fri night) and most of the patrons were an over 60's crowd.  I really feel that the management needs to kick up the social aspect and lively up the place a bit like it used to be.  This certainly isn't some place i would come to enjoy an evening out with friends.  In fact, in the future I'll be considering take out rather than enduring the boring atmosphere here.  Really really need to up the fun factor at this place."}
{"text":"Agree with past reviews of terrible service and over priced food. The service was the worst. Not only rude but incredibly slow. Have given it a chance twice and they have failed both times. Will most definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"We went for a special occasion. The service was great; our server was knowledgeable on the menu items. The food was excellent. They have call ahead for tables, we would like it better if they actually took reservations but they're definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed with my Peppercorn swordfish; it was less a steak and more a patty.  By contrast, others in my table were very happy with their crab cakes and clam chowder.  The beef veg soup was also very good.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"We visited Capstone Grill about a month ago.  (Completely forgot to review)  We were very disappointed.  The prices were high and food was mediocre at best.  For the prices they are charging the portions are small and the food is poor quality.  We were really hoping to like it since it is convenient and we have a lot of coupons from fundraisers our kids have sold.   Even with the discount we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Had the Cajun grilled catfish with Greek salad. The potato was a little over-cooked, but a tasty dinner nonetheless. I wish I would have ordered the stuffed lobster tail with my dinner because the 6oz fish was pretty small. The bread that came with dinner smelled fantastic. Dessert tray was hard to resist, too"}
{"text":"All of our food tasted like mayo, not sure how that happened?  For a Friday night the restaurant was very slow, which was surprising.  Bread was very good, appetizer not so much. Also, the clam chowder was ok but very salty.  Potato pancakes completely plain, wouldn't order again.   My crab cake appetizer was ok.  Scallops entree was nice sized."}
{"text":"We've gone twice, both times in the evening.  The lighting is so low you can barely read the over-priced items listed on the menu.  The food is ok, just ok, and very overpriced.  Both times we've been the waitresses we're kind of rude.  Probably won't be returning..."}
{"text":"Had a very good meal here as did my table mates. We had the lobster stuffed mushrooms for an app and they were yummy. I had the Italian shrimp scampi, large shrimp and tasty dish. They have a nicely sized bar area and a specialty drink menu."}
{"text":"Love the food, especially the seafood but the steaks are great too.  I especially like the Mediterranean preparation.  I like it with grilled salmon."}
{"text":"Abosully horriable. First of all  My son got violently sick on their food. Puls our Appetizers were not hot but the  Lettuce in the salads were and the  lobster was way over cooked. When we complained to the manager the owner came out and was totaly rude and did not correct any of the problems.  Horriable experence all around. Will never go back and suggest you don't go there either."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant ever. I always get the crab cake and clam chowder. Not that the other stuff isn't good, but those are my absolute favorites."}
{"text":"I have had two completely opposite experiences here.  My family and I went here in November for a birthday celebration.  It couldn't have been better.  Their fried oysters appetizer was a huge hit.  The meal was quite good.  In fact it was so good, I received a gift card for the holidays so we could go back and enjoy it again.  Last weekend I returned - and was SO disappointed.  The salad lacked flavor and taste.  Our fried calamari was beyond bland.  The veal chop special was tough and unpleasant.  Fortunately, they hit a home run with the stuffed trout.  Amazing.  If the Capstone Grill had consistency, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"This place, its food, waitstaff and especially management are all TOP NOTCH. My sis & brother-in-law celebrated their 35th wedding anniversary this week and told me (in L.A.) they were going to their favorite spot on their way back from the Meadows. With little time to pull it off, I called and pre-paid for their dinner over the phone from the other side of the country. It was all a surprise & Capstone's managers were more than happy to oblige. Only problem- I didn't have time to get them a picture of the happy couple, so they asked everyone walking in if they happened to be celebrating any occasion. Bingo! They got em & made it happen. My sister was delighted, and not just by the surprise - she reported the Crab Cakes & Filet Mignon were delivered promptly, cooked to perfection and as tasty as ever. Needless to say, the Capstone Grill remains her favorite spot! THANK YOU, gang! You ROCK!"}
{"text":"Have you ever tried your wife's dish and liked it better than yours? Happened to me on my last visit. The crusted halibut was awesome! Tuna appetizer was good but not great. The monk fish was good but not great. next time I'll take my wife's lead and order the halibut."}
{"text":"Food was very good. The service was so fast I felt like they couldn't get rid of us quick enough. We were only a party of two. We were seated next to a large, LOUD group which made me happy we were out of there in 55 minutes. I wouldn't go back. Food wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I have not had a bad meal here  or have my friends i was with for lunch or dinner. Crab cakes have almost no filler with big lumps of crab and salmon almond crusted '- both Re favs. My one friend likes the sirloin with sautee mustrooms. All my out of town visitors want to revisit Capstone for crab cakes or the pick your fish/pick your prep menu. Great white bean chili and roqufort salad (you can add a   of crab, sirloin or salmon) is delicious at lunch"}
{"text":"Seafood is the specialty here. A wide variety available (10+ types of fish, shellfish) with the diner in charge of the major decisions of what method and/or sauce. Part of me thinks this is a good idea, opening up a multitude of variations, and part of me thinks this is a cop-out on the part of the kitchen--failing to make a decision what best suits each seafood.   I chose Alaskan Halibut. First decision was the smaller (6oz) or larger portion. Then, I needed to select a prep. Some of the options that I can recall: Cajun, English (butter+bread crumbs),Simply Char Grilled, Basil Aioli, blackened. There are MANY more options. I went with Parmesan Peppercorn cream sauce. I was then asked what temperature (such as rare, medium, well etc). For halibut?   Loved the fish!  Really. The best piece of fish I have had for a really long time. I opted for a \"Cauliflower Mash\" as a side instead of baked potato. Bad decision. Just the sort of dish that gives cauliflower a bad name. It was a strange texture, loaded with some kind of cheese and it smelled (like stinky cauliflower did when my mom used to boil it to death)  Desserts offered are all cakes, pies and pastries from Bethel Bakery. So, they were definitely quality, but another cop-out. Nothing offered was house made.  Random Notes: there are tv's here & there around the place. We were able to watch Pitt lose in the NCAA first round.  Service was average; our waitress forgot a few items and had to be reminded, but  I got the impression that she had quite a few tables."}
{"text":"Boneless beef ribs were delicious. Got the rice pilaf side and it was a perfect complementary dish. FYI: The following isn't something that typically happens. Aka the 4 stars. My roommate asked for a med rare steak and it came rare. Oh and that was after her clam chowder came out luke warm...."}
