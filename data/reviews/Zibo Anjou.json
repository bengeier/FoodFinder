{"text":"3.5 Je suis aller avec ma petite amie. -Entré:    Soupe au ognions; classic aucune difference avec les autres endroits qui offrent le même plat.   Calmars frits; parfaitement cuits. Pas assez assaisonés à mon gout, heureusement que la sauce donne un peut de gout.  -plat resistance:   Tartare de saumon; quantité moyenne encore une fois moyennement assaisoné.   Bavette avec legumes: tres bon gout et la sauce était bonne. J'ai demandé medium-saigant et la viande est arrivé saignante. Le problème est que mon morceau de viande avait des incisions comme si le cuisto n'etait pas sure de la cuisson et l'a ouvert pour verifier. La sauce a été mise partout par dessus pour tenter de camoufler les incisions...  Dessert:   On était repus et les desserts ne nous inspiraient pas vraiment. On avaient envie de quelque chose de moins classic."}
{"text":"Pour bien manger dans une ambiance simple, lumineuse et conviviale; choisir le côté bar... La nourriture est très bien, surtout la bavette, le saumon, les pâtes au homard et surtout l irruption au chocolat!   Une selection de vin au verre approprié et que l on ne regrette pas dans le rouge... J'aime beaucoup le Syrah...   Le service est agréable, souriant et chaleureux. Une bonne et belle soirée !"}
{"text":"Great food. Fast and good service. Waiter was so nice. Much thanks to all. Will go back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with family. From ordering to delivery of our lunch was 50 minutes, and the restaurant was not full! The service was OK, the food was so so, I ordered the California salad, a big bowl of lettuce with a teaspoon of sunflower seeds, a teaspoon of marinated red peppers, no avocado at all, a sliver of mango and a flavourless piece of chicken. Not worth the price I paid. Its the second time I have been and the second time I have been disappointed with the food - bland and tasteless both times (the other time was the veal with portobellos). I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"A definite find for this area.   This restaurant which does not have an interior entrance at the shopping center,  but only exterior.  has fine food.    I enjoyed the bavette, which had a very nice sauce.  The others had chicken dishes which they enjoyed.  Service was excellent except that they asked if we would like some bread and never brought it.   Maybe that was  just a survey on people liking bread"}
{"text":"I've went there on a date with my boyfriend and would definitely go again.  The restaurant looks neat and fashionable, the music is not too loud, the lights are appropriate to give a smooth atmosphere.  Would absolutely recommend and will be back for sure.  I had a vegetables pasta meal (can't remember the name) which was absolutely delicious and they focused on quality rather than quantity, which many restaurants fail to do.  My SO had a burger, he asked for no mayo, but they put mayo anyway. He asked for another one and it was in front of him merely 5 minutes later. Very fast service !  Slightly expensive, but that is to be expected seeing the quality of the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"My little guy was celebrating his 6th birthday and asked to go somewhere where he could eat a good big burger and a nice dessert, as we were in the area and I've already been to the downtown Zibo, I thought this could be it.   When going to the restaurant with kids, I always try my best to make it quick as their patience could be very unpredictable. As we arrived around 6:30 we were seated quickly, I promptly asked to order (checking the menu online is always useful :)). My son had a Zibo Burger with fries as well as an apple juice. As it's getting warmer I was in the mood for a salad, so I ordered the Zibo! Salad which is made of lettuce, Asian vegetables, avocado, mango, shrimp and chicken breast with a teriyaki vinaigrette as well as a cocktail which unfortunately I do not recall the name. We were served nice portions and everything tasted very good. At the end they offered my son a piece of chocolate cake, asked for his name and three waiters sang happy birthday to him, he was really happy. I really enjoyed my dinner date with my son at Zibo and will definitely be going back in the near future to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Bon Resto, on peu cher mais l'ambiance est bonne. Il faut au moins l'essayer. Excellent pour 5 à 7 entre amis ou bien souper en tête à tête. Je vais sûrement y retourner."}
{"text":"Well, that was a 200$ that I could have spent else where ! Went there with a group of friends, so we decided to start with a drink at the bar, about 30 minutes before our reservation - took about 30 minutes to get a drink at the bar, so we finish it at the table. At our table, 4 nice folding chairs were waiting for us, yup, folding chairs ! I mean, It's still a Zibo restaurant. I've would not have been surprised of this at la Casa Grecque, but at Zibo ?  Then, about 3 minutes after we were seated, waitress comes and ask us for what we've wanted to eat - not even offering something to drink or what kind of wine we wanted...when I asked for the wine list, I got some huge Rolling eyes telling me to hurry up my order.  Food was so-so. I think they forgot to put the taste in the calamars, Steak was cold, veggies were stiff.  So, I probably hit a bad evening for them. I think I would go again, but I would bring my own chairs !!!"}
{"text":"Je m'y rendais sans attente particulière. À mon arrivée, je demande un cocktail virgin. On me répond qu'on doit me charger le prix d'un cocktail alcoolisé parce qu'il n'y a pas de touche virgin sur leur caisse pour ce drink, si çà me dérangeait. Surprise, je réponds çà ne me dérange pas mais que c'est complètement illogique. En plus, le cocktail était un peu décevant, à base de soda, grenadine, purée de mangue (remplaçant la vodka mangue). Je crois qu'avec du 7up plutôt que du soda, le cocktail aurait été meilleur. Comme entrée des Nems au poulet, délicieux. Plat principal, ravioli au homard, encore là aucune attente. Agréablement surprise, ravioli et sauce gouteux avec des morceaux de homard et non pas une purée goutant à peine le homard comme dans d'autres restaurants. Je conseille ce plat fortement. Le menu est élaboré et peut satisfaire n'importe quel appétit. Belle cave à vins pour les amateurs. Finalement à la réception de ma facture, on me charge un daiquiri virgin soit la moitié de la valeur de mon cocktail version alcoolisé. J'imagine que la serveuse a remarqué qu'elle était illogique et a trouvé une solution (pourtant simple), ce qui fut tout de même apprécié. Si je pouvais je donnerais 3,5!"}
{"text":"Nous etions 8 pour manger sur la terrasse vide. Le maître-autel nous a refusé parce qu'il ne voulait pas coller des tables. 8"}
{"text":"Great place with good service.   I feel that I've ordered the wrong dish (veal, lime and beurre blanc) and I wasn't very satisfied. But somehow something tells me that this has place has a big potential and I will be back.   The appetizer was delicious (panned shrimp) and I definitely will repeatedly it next time.   For the record, mon chum ordered chicken and he loved it."}
