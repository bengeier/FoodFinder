{"text":"I ordered Pad Thai to go. I came to hotel only to throw that away next day as the food was stinking so bad that I didn't have enough nerve to eat it. I put in the freeze the first day thinking that my nose might be too sensitive. Next day, I put in the microwave to heat it and the whole hotel room started having the same stinking environment that I had the previous day. I don't know if the chicken that they bought was in clearance in some back alley.
When I was waiting for the order, the lady was dealing with the seafood vendor and she was playing with the seafood with empty hands in open. 
So I don't know where they buy the meat but it didn't look healthy for what I saw. 
I might give them one more try before I give up when I am Vegas again."}
{"text":"Ordered a spicy thai basil lunch special and an eggplant dish. Both are fabulous! I've been looking for a place like this since I moved to the Vegas strip three months ago. This will definitely become my \"go to\" place whenever I have a craving for authentic thai food. The owner is from Bangkok!"}
{"text":"Great food and delivery was right on time.  Recommened."}
{"text":"I'm not from around the area but went on yelps advice. Area was a bit sketchy with sketchy figures lingering around the strip mall. We walked in and walked right out because it just didn't feel right. There was no one else in the place but it was 2:30pm."}
{"text":"The owner and her husband used to work at the top Thai restaurants in Vegas, she explained to us as we were waiting for our food to cook. 
I had been looking at Thai Siam on yelp but the prices seemed so expensive. Here duck curry is $10 not $28. Turns out the owner of this Thai place worked at Thai Siam for many years as a cook. 
We ordered red curry and Pad see ew last night. Everything was delicious and we are back today to get more! Drunken noodles, duck curry, green curry, fried rice. The prices are so reasonable and the food is outstanding. Certainly 5 star Thai! 

We mentioned there are only 2 tables to sit at inside and she said it was because the health department only allows to go order since there is no bathroom for guests to use. Makes sense."}
{"text":"Driving around Vegas looking for something different. This place hit the spot! Started with chicken satay and chicken wings then main dishes of Pad Thai, Tom Yum Chicken soup, and chicken red curry were all very tasty. Everyone was super nice. Try it you'll like it :)"}
{"text":"I traveled with my family stayed in the hotel, searched on Yelp and find this place close by with good review. The menu looks good so ordered Pad Tai, Pad Se-Ew, drunken Noodle using yelp quick order and delivery function -  the food delivered quickly, however to my surprise all three dishes came with no meat at all just noodle and Tofu. I thought there were meat in the dishes, not sure what happened, maybe i just missed the selections somehow?? Anyway, the food taste good if there were meat in it they will be perfect. Lesson learned - I will not trust the online order again, just call in and make sure you are ordering what you want!!"}
{"text":"We are at Las Vegas for work and needed to order something to eat. We were not expecting much, but OMG, pretty damn good food. Got the crab fried rice and pad Thai. Wow wow, amazing. Lady delivered it to us herself. I will not forget this place. Highly recommend thos place"}
{"text":"First off,  Frank delivered our meal very quickly.  He was very friendly and pleasant.  We ordered the pineapple red curry with chicken, which was delicious! I would definitely go back for this. We also ordered the pad Thai with shrimp.   I couldn't eat it.   It tasted and smelled like stinky fish food out the bottom of a fish tank.   My mom ate some, not noticing the scent and flavor, as she has had a cold.  She ended up getting sick afterwards.   When you go, go for the curry not the pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Get here while they're new and inexpensive! I've paid way more for pretty good Thai food! Wish I lived nearby a place like this..."}
{"text":"Today I order combination fried rice and tom kha shrimp. they are very good food and good taste and also fair price."}
{"text":"It was delicious! After a long day at a trade show, we wanted something close. Thai D was right around the corner. Massamum curry was delicious with great service to match. I definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"The Pad See Ew (pork) was the best I've ever eaten!! I can't wait to come back and try it again!"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night with a party of 14 and everything was delish!  What a refreshing change from the overpriced, not-so-delish food at the casino hotel.  The waiter was awesome!  Waters out asap for everyone, orders on separate tabs, and food out quickly.  Everyone loved their orders...food was fresh and perfect flavors!  Tom kha soup was a favorite, along with the egg rolls,  red curry and pad se-ew.  Some of the best Thai food we've had.  Will find our way back here next time we are in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Great food! I loved the great taste of the pad see ew! The person who took our order is very helpful and pleasant. All the food came out great! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good. I have had the pad thai, drunken noodles and I am completely in love with the yellow curry. I try to order other things but seem to be drawn to that dish. I would not have expected to find such good food in the area but I was wrong. There is a lack of dine in eating but I take it home. The staff is very pleasant."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and fast!! I got the yellow curry lunch special and it was delicious. I'm not a big fan of spicy and they were able to make it just right. If you're looking for a fast lunch place with friendly service then I recommend here."}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars I would!  In town for a quick 1-night business trip, staying at a hotel near the strip and was craving good thai food.  This place did not disappoint.  I ordered the shrimp rolls (yummy), pad see ew with beef (superb flavor), and red curry with chicken (medium spice... just perfect!).  Everything was flavored perfectly and tasted fresh.  When I went to pick it up, the owner had my order waiting and was very friendly.  I felt like I just had an old friend make dinner for me... would highly recommend this place.  Don't let the dilapidated strip mall around the restaurant scare you away.  It's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This is a very authentic Thai restaurant. Their Pad Thai is the best.  Both me and my wife enjoy their foods and we take a lot of take out after our dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent prices. A must try if you like Thai food. My favorite is the spicy basil fried rice."}
{"text":"I cannot express how disappointed I was in this place. Not only did I end up paying $45 for probably the worst Thai food that I've ever had, but also the fact that talking to the woman on the phone was a true exercise in futility. 

I'm saying that because at first I didn't know if there was a language barrier or if she just didn't understand English very well, but one thing is certain, she understood my credit card number when I gave that out.

Next to add insult to injury, they sent my food via Uber Express delivery (it was printed on the sack with the food) or whatever that was supposed to be and it was some old, toothless woman I believe she was Mexican-Jamaican, though I'm not really sure, all I know is that she acted like she didn't speak English either. 

Then there was what looked like a bunch of hoodlums in the backseat about three deep. I half expected them to rob me and had I not been standing right there in Caesar's Valet in front of a million witnesses, they probably would have. A very young, Asian female teen in the passenger seat is trying to tell me that they went to Planet Hollywood by accident and I asked her: \"Does Caesar's Palace sound anything like Planet Hollywood?

So this is one hour after the expected delivery time and that's not including the time I was told that they would arrive and that was after the food was made. So total time was two hours-ten minutes and the place was just down the street. You can check that out for yourself.

The food was cold. The shrimp rolls looked and tasted like the ones you get out the frozen foods section at Walmart. The noodles were soggy and over-cooked in both the Pad Thai and the Pad Se Ew and the Tom Kha was cold and horrible and half of what I've ever ordered anywhere else. A waste of time and money. Eat there at your own risk.

As for me? Never again."}
{"text":"Place an order through Postmates because it was convinient. First time trying this place. My food arrived promptly. Even though my food was not prepared with spice  like requested it was absolutely tasty. I have not found another thai restaurant as good as this one. Will definately order again, just hope my order is done correctly next time."}
{"text":"Sunday night at 630pm, still over 104F.  Lot of people comes in to pick up their to go order.  I ordered green curry chicken and spicy basil chicken (rice plate), $7 per plate.  I like the green curry chicken (tender chicken breast, not overcooked) although the eggplant looks old and beat up.  Spicy basil is a little bit too sweet for me, and not enough heat.  Overall good value and taste not bad."}
{"text":"Incredible. If I could give this place a zero starred review, I would. Will not ever return."}
{"text":"Stopped in at lunch time with a friend. We were both feeling kind of under the weather and nothing clears you out like nice spicy Thai food!

The place is smaller, but clean and nice looking. It was kind of busy, seemed like they get a lot of to go orders! The menu is simple and easy to figure out and the prices are great.

We sat at a table and the nice lady working brought menus and water. We used the coupon for the free Thai tea and she gave us an extra one which was really sweet and awesome!

I ordered the Tom kha with chicken spicy level 10. My friend ordered the drunken noodles with beef lunch special, also spicy level 10. We also had the beef jerky app per her suggestion. 

The beef jerky was good, the pieces were a little small, but the fish sauce was great! My Tom kha was really good, the flavor was on point, but it could have been a little spicier. My friend liked his drunken noodles, but again, could have been spicier. 

Overall the service was definitely 5 stars and I'll definitely go back!! Only thing was the spice level wasn't quite as high as we prefer. I'd definitely recommend this place for good quality Thai food at a great price !!"}
{"text":"This joint is probably one of my favorite Thai places to eat at. Being a lover of Thai food dishes, I had to check this place out since I work at Boulevard Mall across the street. The food is excellent and flavorful for a great price! Every time I go in for lunch I'm always welcomed with great service. Food comes out in speedy consistency and the quality never disappoints."}
{"text":"Food was meh and the portions are small. Got the combination pad se ew and there were two shrimps only. Also got the chicken fried rice, the tomatoes were not that good, would have been better to leave them fresh. Definitely not worth the price. Going to a buffet would have been a better deal."}
{"text":"Not 4, 5 starsss,, good taste, clean, very good service, try it, you gonna lime it, I'll premise"}
{"text":"Very friendly and warm place here. 

This doubles as a karaoke bar which seemed like a great place for a night of fun. I ordered takeout so unfortunately I couldn't stay but I'm sure that if I did, it would be a good time. 

I can tell by the smell of the curry if it's gonna be good. 

It's in a corner of a plaza so if you blink, you might miss it but it's definitely a little hidden treasure that's worth searching for."}
{"text":"We tried this place twice. First was Friday evening, I has the pineapple fried rice and my wife had the seafood salad. Next time was Sunday for lunch, I had the silver noodle salad and my wife had the pad se ew. all four meals were delicious. just returning from Thailand i can accurately say that the taste was authentic. Everything on the menu is priced under $10.  This has to be one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the USA.  It really is aw whole in the wall, mom and pop shop with only two tables, but plenty of to go orders. they have some delivery available."}
{"text":"Stopped by Thai D Togo and Kay, the manager, was very kind making sure our order was perfect. The food is great and the prices are reasonable. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Don't let the title fool you you can actually eat in if yuh don't want to take out Togo. 

5 Stars for the food. 
5 Stars for the price. 
5 Stars for the Thai Tea and trust me I 'm a picky Thai tea drinker and this place had a perfect mix. 

Very glad we found this Thai restaurant. Less than a mile away from the Marriott hotels we usually stay at by paradise rd."}
{"text":"WOW! Was that a good meal.  I'm in town for business and I know there's of lot of restaurants in Vegas that are top quality. But I'm in my hotel room and I wanted food delivered and ordered from this restaurant. I ordered the Thai basil fried rice, crab ragoon and spring rolls. Everything was VERY good. The serving sizes were huge too. I would order from here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Egg rolls were HOT, nice and fresh. Hubby said they were the best egg rolls ever. The cashew chicken melts in your mouth, the curry good spice..nice and tasty. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's decently priced and the food is authentic. The quality of their products could be double checked though. My delivery experience from them was a bit of a pain."}
{"text":"Honestly don't order from this place at night. I got some Pad Thai around midnight and it was absolutely disgusting. Tasted OLD. Same with egg rolls and rice noodles. Genuinely disgusting and went straight in the trash"}
{"text":"Have to admit, we were a little skeptical about this place based on the location! But we were hungry and it was late and it had pretty decent reviews! It's definitely a hole in the wall, but man the food was great and everyone was super friendly! The only down side was how loud it was with the karaoke.... but all in all we will probably be back!!"}
{"text":"Anyone's heard about Thai food come by Thai D Togo it's amazing food like original Pad Thai so so tasty plus they got Panang curry  absolutely perfect test and don't forget to order Appetizers combination plate four different variety with the price $7.95 that you can't find any Thai restaurant plus customer service awesome they're so friendly made you feel like home big enough for any party nice and cleanness If you think about sweet Thai Ice tea will be a good choice for Thai food definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I work near this little Thai place and I always come back during my lunch break. Their prices are great, large portions with great taste. I always get the chicken fried rice and a Thai tea. It's my regular order, I've tried various things on the menu and they all taste great. They've become pretty busy now when it comes to walk ins so I just order to go and they always have it quick and ready. All the ladies who work there are very nice and welcoming. Good food for cheap"}
{"text":"Worst worst worst food available here . Service is okey but food is uncooked , alert you all who is thinking to visit this Thai food restaurant please it's unhealthy food here . Makes u feel sick ."}
{"text":"Way below average food.I usually eat quite hot but their medium was inedible as it was more like hot hot. The red chicken curry had about 5 tiny pieces of chicken thinly sliced. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money as there are better Thai restaurants around."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage. Ordered chicken pad Thai and pork fillies rice, and wow my dog wouldn't even eat this. I will never order here again and will do my best to keep people FAR AWAY. Seriously STAY AWAY. Only gets one star because I can't submit review with NONE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great and well prepared. The service was fast and the people who work here are very friendly."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Thai food this is the place to eat. Amazing food every time. Great service. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was definitely umm Meh... Not at all what I expected based on the rating... I'm only giving them 2 stars since there Thai ice tea was decent. We ordered Drunken Noodles shrimp that had more veggies then noodles. We also had the Pineapple Fried Rice (all you could taste was curry) and for the the grand finally a poor excuse for Orange Chicken, not only was It was soggy it had absolutely Noooo flavor and to top it off it was slimy. We informed the waitress that we did not like chicken at all and they still charged us for it. Definitely Never going back. Super disappointed. Sorry about it."}
{"text":"A Thai oasis in the desert 
I came in search of Thai food on a weeknight.

The reviews do not lie, this place was amazing.

The staff was friendly and polite. 

The red curry and pad see ew were fantastic: spicy, and flavorful.

The serving size is standard for a Thai restaurant, with prices at least $2-3 under what's expected in LA.

I would try this place again to explore more of the menu and recommend to anyone seeking authentic Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"I normally don't like to give negative reviews unless I was mad or seriously disappointed. Unfortunately, the food here is really not tasty. Everything is way too sweet. We have ordered four different dishes. All of them were too sweet and kinda disappointing.  We couldn't finish the food. I have tried many Thai restaurants. The food are normally either good or just so so. Most time they are good. But this one is really not tasty. It is hard to fail on Pad Thai but they did. So the food wise I would only give 2 stars. The service is not bad. When I ordered, I mentioned the kid would have pad Thai, so they served the pad Thai before anything else. That was smart."}
{"text":"Even thou he menu says the soup is included for lunch special, they said that is a mistake and didn't serve when I dined in."}
{"text":"I came into this restaurant around 6pm and there wasn't anyone here except for the workers eating dinner. I don't mind that at all, but I do mind how their food tastes. I ordered a chicken pad Thai and it was $6.95! I was so excited because you couldn't get this kind of price anywhere for Thai food.  However, I was pretty disappointed with the pad Thai. It didn't really taste like pad Thai at all. I don't know if I'll be returning here."}
{"text":"Room service at Encore hotel was ridiculously expensive so I decided to help places where they delivered and found this gem. I had to call them to see how I was get my food and they advised me to meet the driver at the valet parking in front of the hotel.
It was raining and waited for the guy for 10 minutes but apparently he was parked off to the side. Went upstairs and devoured my spicy chicken basil rice plate. I also ordered the pad see ewe which was delicious. The food was reasonable and beats paying $30 for a lobster quesadilla. 
Thank you Yelp for making ordering food for delivery anywhere easy!!"}
{"text":"Really good! 
We had the pad Thai and the pad see ew. Both were spot on, with Thai ice tea. Can't go wrong. 

Will definitely be coming back to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"secret delicious spot. i've been ordering with postmates (which i love) and didn't realize how close it was to my apartment. spontaneous thai tea trips can now be a thing with this gem within walking distance #winning"}
{"text":"Best Soups!! We found this place online so Happy we came, we seen the reviews and decided to give it a Try! These soups have so much flavor! They were delicious!! We ordered #15 & #16!! Highly recommend this place!! Great prices and close to strip!!"}
{"text":"Finding *gems* is my thing and Thai D to go shines!

Best Orange Chicken ever = hot, fresh, crispy~light flakiness all at once over perfectly steamed White Rice.  

Deliciously spicy / slightly sour Thai Sausage over fresh, zingy veggies from Specials board.

Spot on Pad Thai.

Super friendly staff and I felt like I was being fed by a lovely family.

My guy and I are just visiting Vegas but thinking to stop in again this trip and the next."}
{"text":"A Thai food hole in the wall that could of had so much potential for being a gem instead this place turned out to be a severe disappointment. Unfortunately the food and cooking is inconsistent and below mediocre. The first time we ate here the food was very good. Second time was like night and day. Nothing including the rice tasted fresh. The yellow curry was watery, bland and no flavor & the chicken was rubbery and potatoes hard as a rock. The pad see ew tasted old and the noodles had a strange texture and the meat tasted beyond rancid. Will never return back here again. It was awful."}
{"text":"Cheap. Fresh. Flavorful. Ample parking. Friendly service. Live music. Good quality of food. It's my go-to Thai restaurant for to-go food."}
{"text":"Had the pad Thai with chicken, spice level 5 and it was great!!! I was in and out in less then 10 minutes and the cashier was very friendly. The food was great. It was fast. And overall I think I will be coming back over and over an over again."}
{"text":"Great environment, looks like live band plays here sometime.  The customer service was mediocre at best and on top of that they tried to serve us cold Rangoon's in our take out and gave us the wrong soup. As for the food it was good. 

See pics....."}
{"text":"It's delicious, and fast to serve our order get to hotel, I will recommend my friends to here."}
{"text":"Yelpers have rarely led me astray, but wow. I've competed in muay thai for over 8 years and I'm used to the bomb thai food we would get after fights from Mom and Pop thai restaurants all over, so I normally know what to expect when I order regardless of what state I eat in. 
So, I ordered just some chicken satay and fried tofu, because I didn't want anything too heavy or huge since I'd been up traveling since 3:30 am. Chicken satay was bland and the peanut sauce wasn't really peanut sauce, but a weird fusion of peanut, creamy white stuff (I'm praying its mayo) and sriracha or some other type of chili. Ew. Fried tofu was sad, not crispy and no dipping sauce!! Who wants to eat plain, sad, fried tofu? It should come with a sweet, spicy chili sauce.Soooooo, yeah. This is one of the saddest dinners I've ever wasted my money on. Do yourself a favor and just hit In N Out next time. I wish I did. :("}
{"text":"Simple hole in the wall joint that packs a huge punch. Very clean establishment very open and their even working on a karaoke stage I believe. I've only come here during the day so I don't really know how it is at night. But I can say that the food here is legit Thai food for an astounding price. The Panang curry is probably the best thing on the menu and their sticky rice is always super fresh and just right. 

The lady that's always taking orders and is always very nice and easy to speak with. 
The chef is super speedy and always gets the food out hot fresh and tasty. The Thai teas here are something to just come here for alone. 

Other places load their Thai teas up with so much added sweetness you will taste more of the tea here than at other places. I would highly recommend this place especially if you've ever been to Thailand and want some real Thai food!"}
{"text":"It's always the family owned ethnic restaurant in the  of the hood that be DA BOMB! Don't be afraid to venture into the hood, if you need to take a friend it's OK, totally understandable. Hell, I'm always on ALERT, but this is not a review about the neighborhood , this is a review about some DELICIOUS-ass Thai food.

The restaurant is situated at the back of the small shopping area, 2 doors down from family dollar. Very spacious restaurant, very clean, a few pics of dishes on the wall. Unlike other restaurants that uses pictures as the menu you won't find that here. I believe 8 or 9 pictures on the wall.

If you've scanned through my reviews you might have noticed my pad thai addiction.  Pad Thai is like America and apple pie, it's an automatic. If you fudge this up, I don't want to try any other dish at your restaurant. Pad Thai is my safe choice when trying a new place.

So the pad Thai, the flavor was good, not too sweet. Tofu, slightly firm, a little crisp at the corners of the tofu. Green onion, crushed peanuts and bean sprouts w/ a little file sauce. The only complaint that I have would be the bean sprouts. They were kind of  limp, no crunch, I mistaked them for noodles. But all in all  it was delicious.

Check in on Yelp and you get a free soda or iced thai tea. I almost made the mistake of getting soda instead of tea. I'm glad I didn't, the Thai tea is nice and settled. The tea used is a strong brew but the chai mix balance it out. Th sweetness of the chai and the bitterness of the the tea, which kicks in again at the end of the sip. Go ahead and bring $2.25 b/c your gonna wanna 2, drink your free one and save the other for later. It's really good.

I'm going back, I gotta try the chicken larb next...and get 2 iced Thai teas"}
{"text":"I'm broke, lazy and vain, so I eat at Chipotle almost every night -- $10 for a healthy meal, no prep or dishwashing required. But every now and then, my lazy ass doesn't finish up at the gym until after 10pm, when Chipotle closes. What to do?!?

Finding myself in this terrible First-World predicament last week, I hit up Yelp: one dollar sign! Near me! Open now!

This place came up, and it was fantastic! I called ahead with my order, then cruised over from Hooters, where I'd stopped in after my workout to visit a gay British actor friend who simply INSISTED I come by for a quick hello (causing me to miss Chipotle...grrr). 

Hooters is pretty close to this place, so my order wasn't quite ready yet when I got there, and I had to hang out for a bit. But that turned out to be the best part! This was 11pm on a Tuesday night, but this place was JAM PACKED with Thai diners enjoying some kind of royal feast, with a fabulous, heavily made-up drag queen in what looked to be traditional Thai ceremonial attire as interpreted by Bob Mackie onstage belting Thai ballads for entertainment. WOW!! 

I never wanted to leave, but my order eventually came out and I so I went home to eat. It was DELICIOUS! I had massaman curry, a 7 on the 1-to-10 scale of spiciness. It was HOT, but just right for me! I will say though that a \"7\" here is hotter than a \"7\" at other Thai places I've eaten at. 

Total cost with tip was under $11 -- the same price as my beloved Chipotle! Healthy-wise, the curry was probably not bad...but it also came with a big side of white rice, which canceled out the veggies in the curry. So I will probably continue with my Chipotle diet....and just hit this place for emergencies.

But I am a HUGE FAN!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome anyone that is staying at Vegas I would highly recommend this place for you. And they also deliver"}
{"text":"Ok, food was not great, but staff and prices where good.

Food was noodle heavy, without flavor (pad Thai).

Previous reviews stating no eat in tables where at the wrong place, there's a whole storefront of seating at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Plan ambiance really and kind of in a bad neighborhood but Great quality food for a great price! Not too sweet not to spicy. We had Pad see ew, and Yellow curry. Very nice people with good service. Graded \"A\" for cleanliness."}
{"text":"Thai heavenly food prepared fresh and yummy! Perfect place to chill and relax while savoring thai culture"}
{"text":"Food here is excellent! I had the pad se ew and yellow curry. Just enough of a spicy kick. He had me choose from a scale of 1-10. Which I think is a good way to assess someone's taste buds. I'm for sure coming back for lunch:)"}
{"text":"Really good food for very reasonable price ! Came with a big group and they were very accommodating . They gave us free iced tea, and some egg rolls ! Pad Thai is the best !  red curry is also really good . Definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"First time here. Excellent food excellent price. 
This will be a place we will return on a consistent basis. Nothing more needs to be said."}
{"text":"I ordered food for delivery and it literally arrived in less than 30 minutes. Umm? I got excited, I didn't know if it was a bad thing or a good thing. Anyways I ordered Tom yum kung (shrimp soup), drunken noodles, and crab rangoon. Everything was good. Not the best Thai food I've had but still good. I will definitely be ordering food again."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall. But amazing food! Some of the best Thai food I've had in Vegas. Ordered the lunch special Drunken Noodles that came with the salad and an egg roll."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery during a business trip to Vegas. Hands down one of the best Thai meals, I've ever had. I highly recommend giving them a try. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"The food was really good, and the prices were a steal. Usually it's hard to find good take out food.This place not only had good food and prices but the manager Kay was very friendly and you can tell she loves what she does. I recommend this restaurant. Tammy"}
{"text":"This was the best lunch experience we had the entire trip. Terry made our afternoon! Food was really enjoyable and very affordable, but the service and daytime karaoke was amazing. Our group of 5 pretty much had the entire place to ourselves. A number of people were in and out with to go orders, but Terry let us karaoke throughout our entire meal. It was so much fun and we will definitely be back. Yummy food, beer/ wine, great company...all in all...it was the perfect lunch."}
{"text":"Food has always been great. Ordering Online isn't for me it wasn't spicy enough I blame it on ordering online over all good food and great service. Again not best side of town but really a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I struggled a little on the five star review, but only because the seafood soup said crab, but contained imitation crab (but nice quality stuff).  This was my first time and the rest was so outstanding I couldn't complain.  I ordered a bowl of seafood soup to go.  I asked the very polite lady who answered the phone if it was good and she explained that yes, and it was in a hot and sour broth.  I said I was looking for a chicken broth based soup (sinuses) and started looking for another soup.  She responded they would be happy to do my soup in chicken broth.

15 minutes (to go order); walked in and noticed immediately there may not be much seating, but the place was spotless.  The lady behind the counter was taking someone else's order, but gave me a big smile to acknowledge me and asked me if I was their to go order.  She was extremely sweet for the entire transaction, and appreciated the compliment that I had been referred by customers at Madison Avenue (sports bar across the street).

As mentioned, I got seafood noodle soup.  Mussels (huge in shell!), a surprising number of large shrimp (and VERY fresh tasting - nothing had been sitting), squid rings (no tentacles here) cooked properly, and imitation crab in chicken broth.  The chicken broth was heaven - perfect spice, not overly salty as most places!  It was wonderful with the seafood, not overpowering.  My favorite part of the soup was the box that came with it - I opened it up and found half a box of perfectly cooked rice noodles, tossed with mild spices and lots of fresh cilantro, on top of half a box of the freshest bean sprouts I've had since I left Seattle last week - traditional Pho style soup!  I put the soup and the noodles and sprouts into a larger container thinking I'd take some for work tomorrow.  Nope.  Scarfed the entire thing.  Absolutely delicious.

Also got an order of crab rangoon to split with my roommate.  Okay, I know these are going to have imitation crab.  They were soft on the bottom (not overfried and greasy like some places) but the tips were super crispy.  Loved the sweet chili sauce on the side instead of the usual sweet and sour sauce (which my roommate can never eat since he's allergic to pineapple. Chili sauce has none).  

As someone who hangs out in our Chinatown a lot, I am impressed. These folks know their stuff. Don't let the neighborhood scare you - some of the best restaurants in Vegas are in meh areas.  I've never had an issue around here.  I look forward to trying more on their menu and definitely some of the other dishes reviewers have mentioned!"}
{"text":"Ordered late night take out and it was delicious!  Arrived quickly and hot, everything was very flavorful and the order was accurate.  Will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"So I been looking for some good Thai food lately and live close to this place so I decided to try it. Come to my luck this little family joint has some really good food! I got the vegetarian egg rolls and the tofu with broccoli stir with a spice level of 8. Amazing food. Amazing flavors. Next time I need the spice level to be 10 lol"}
{"text":"For the price the food was fine. The staff was really nice and helpful. I ordered take out and asked to have extra chili sauce and jalapenos. They assured me they would make sure it was there. Even after getting my bag, I was about to open it to check, and the server assured me that he personally put it in the bag. Since he seemed nice and was helpful up to that point I believed him. Not until I got back to our hotel did I notice he in fact DID NOT put what I asked for. It was upsetting."}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price! Not far from convention center. They just expand d and now have a huge dining room good for groups.  Consistently good food."}
{"text":"I always order from here on Uber Eats, but thought I'd try stopping by in person. The staff is so nice! We had a great conversation with the manager as well! Thai D Togo is a must!"}
{"text":"Last week we had the orange chicken with pieces of real white meat chicken in a very light breading, pineapple curry that when you took a bite and sucked in air around the bite you could literally breathe in the pineapple essence and the Thai style Tom yum that was just a simple good soup 
Everything was great, large portions we all were able to share and try each other's meals! Ordered again tonight and instead of the Tom yum we got the drunken noodle again everything was fantastic big bites of chicken and noodles that were cooked up perfectly. We did mild and mild is pretty spicy-you know that slight burn around your mouth and lips I know we will order again but I'm going without any spiciness at all. I'm a wimp."}
