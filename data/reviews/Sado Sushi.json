{"text":"Love this place. The food is delicious and it's quite nice inside. The staff are very nice and courteous."}
{"text":"As a confirmed sushi snob, and having visited an extensive variety of japanese restaurants throughout the Toronto area, I can honestly say that Sado Sushi is the best of the best. It's our favorite spot for fresh and authentic Sushi & Sashimi and they also have some amazing fusion rolls and rice dishes as well. We're weekly visitors to Sado (sometimes twice a week) and always come back, no matter how many other restaurants we try.

If you really appreciate true quality, freshness and creativity, then you definitely don't want to miss out on what Sado has to offer. Their service is freindly and prompt and the atmosphere is quite nice, with a modern touch and quiet jazz music playing in the backround."}
{"text":"Sadly, as of May 2014, Sado Sushi is closed. It is the best of the neighbourhood sushi restaurants in Upper Village by a wide margin. The fish was fresh and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Almost always excellent sushi and service

The odd time it's a bit dry. 

For delivery expect an hour delivery time on average. worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Even after using a Groupon, the service and quality and quantity of food was still good. Would recommend this place with or without a Groupon."}
{"text":"went here on a groupon, was decent...
the sushi pizza was a highlight for sure.

nothing out of this world, but worth the drive to midtown."}
{"text":"Sado Sushi is really hit or miss.

The first time I went, the food was wonderful. I brought a friend there a few weeks later, it was mediocre.

My mom is a huge fan of Japanese food, so I took her there on a visit. She liked it so much, we went back the next day, and again on her next visit to Toronto a month later. Both times, the food was quite good.

Went back last night with a Japanese friend, who is also a chef, and of course, it was mediocre night. (This is the second time I've taken her to a hit-or-miss restaurant for lack of a better option, and both times were \"miss\" nights. I suspect she's going to lose faith in my ability to choose soon. :))

When they're on, it's a four-star place. Clean, good service, fairly speedy, really good food.

When they're off, it's a two-star. Still clean, still good service, still fairly speedy - just that the food's not up to my standard.

The fact that they are usually almost completely empty makes me wonder how they stay in business, since I've been going there off'n'on since March and other than the occasional large group, I've never seen more than three other tables occupied.

One complaint: Why do they, like so many other restaurants, always leave the door to the women's washroom propped open? Do they assume we want an auditory audience of everyone walking by?"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh, delicious sushi. Sashimi was heavenly.  I found the place through a groupon deal and we'll definitely be retuning. So good."}
