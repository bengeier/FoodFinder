{"text":"This is easily the most underrated restaurant in Toronto. I do not use that word lightly. I have eaten at many Toronto Life establishments in my time and these dudes makes some of the most interesting and tasty food with ingredients id never think worked well together.   The menu is written a little vague. Just ignore it and go for it. Seriously."}
{"text":"Raised the bar. We had an amazing culinary experience! Enjoyed everything we tried! Couldn't fault it. Will be back next time we visit Vancouver."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch to this new neighbourhood spot. Although the soup portion was a bit on the small side, it was very yummy and the rest of the meal was ample and very tasty. Decor and ambience are great, and the service was very friendly. A fantastic and much needed addition to this stretch of college!"}
{"text":"I'm very reluctant to write this review, because Me & Mine is my favourite place to eat brunch. Let me repeat that: it is my favourite place to eat brunch. I've been here more than a dozen times since they've opened and have quickly become a regular.   The staff are lovely - relaxed and friendly while still attentive and on-point. The food is inventive, but familiar. They'll do things like pink deviled eggs (pickled with beets for colour) or homemade maple fennel sausage or butter infused with carrots for a little sweetness and colour or grilled watermelon and it's all just wonderful. Make sure you try the torched trout chowder, if you have the chance!"}
{"text":"I tried this place today for lunch. I was surprised to see how small the menu was, didn't have many options. I saw the dinner menu and noticed it had more options so I will probably return for dinner next time.   I tried the special of the day, two poached eggs, fried beans, guacamole, tomato and plum salsa, arugula salad and a sausage, served on a crepe. Everything was delicious, but for me the guacamole seemed overpowered with onion and took over the other flavors. I also had their soup of the day, broccoli and cauliflower with mustard, which was delicious. And tried the apple cider, which I found a tad overpriced for the amount you get and it was served to us warm. Also, the water jug they gave us when we sat down was filled with warm water. I would have preferred cold.   The restaurant is small and clean. The front window was wide open, letting in a nice breeze and the music was great too.   I would recommend trying this place, but if you want a larger selection of food I would go for dinner time."}
{"text":"delicious and super creative food. i had the parsnip cheddar puff (like a souffle) served with a poached egg and \"carrot hollandaise\" sauce, thick grilled toast and a fresh apple and watercress salad -- made for a perfect brunch.  coffee topped up free.  lovely staff with no attitude. wish i could come here every weekend! simple stylish decor."}
{"text":"I've had brunch and dinner here and both meals were amazing. The food is excellent but the spot-on, charming service makes it a new favourite for all I've dined with. Love the ambiance created by the fans as well."}
{"text":"The dinner is too good. Dishes are inventive and display remarkable finesse. Sometimes a touch on the homey side--which one should expect at these prices--but always with a real aim for the stars. Components of your dishes, or entire dishes, will make you feel like you are at the home of a great chef, who is taking the evening off from plating things with tweezers to cook for their best friends the kind of food they really like to eat.   Brunch is also quite good. An antidote to other brunches.   Not everything is perfect, but again, that's not what you are there for. It's so reasonably priced that you want them to take risks.   Very very friendly service."}
{"text":"The simple menu marked on the blackboard doesn't describe the amazing food they serve from Apple collards to steak kebabs, cornbread and many more delights. The rosemary chocolate pudding is one of the best chocolate puddings I've ever tasted! Great spot, wonderful food and good vibes."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. The chef was heavy handed on the seasoning and dressings. The meat was overcooked and dry. It was one disappointing dish after another. Restaurant is cute and the price is right. Just was underwhelmed. Would never go back."}
{"text":"Unique locally sourced dishes, and all about the daily specials. Where as most places serve standard food, it feels like the owners and chefs of me and mine are playfully experimenting with dishes appropriate to the  region and the season. Potted trout, rutabaga pie, and braised goat are just some of the entrees here on any given night. The only thing I can guarantee is that the dishes you try here will be delicious, and you'll never have tasted anything quite like it. Over the past few months this has become my favorite restaurant in Toronto. And that's saying something in a food town like this. The brunch is amazing, and the dinner is even better. All platitudes are well deserved. Every dish is thought out to be unique, from the taste to the color to the plating. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped in here again for the 2nd time with my bf- I honestly can not say enough good things about this little spot. All the dishes are smaller plates to share, the menu is creative/ always changing, and moderately priced. Our favorite dishes from last night were... everything, but if I had to choose, I have to say I loved the radish fritters, cola ribs, Mac & Cheese, and trout cakes. Ethan was our server and he was a delight. Make note: they do offer a chef's tasting for $40/PP and on Wednesdays they have 1/2 priced bottles of wine. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Honestly, best brunch in the city. The compound butter!!!!! so so so good. I often get the breakfast with baked beans and I went on the weekend and had the french onion bread pudding mmmmmmmm it was sooo good! My dad got the breakfast poutine, also amazing. Just go here now if you are considering it JUST GO! They will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Food was alright, not too memorable. The butter was quite interesting though - compound butter with beets. Not sure I'd come back for brunch, maybe dinner to try though!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Went for brunch. Returned for dinner the same day. Repeat offence and totally, unabashedly, glad to be guilty. Sign me up again and again. I will bring my mama and you KNOW our mamas only deserve the best. The food makes you feel good. It is fresh and healthy. There's an equal balance between meat and veg. The staff are delightful and knowledgeable. There was no wait. This is bound to be the next big thing. Date spot. Friends spot. Undefined relationship status spot. Go, go, and go again."}
{"text":"Had Saturday brunch with a friend and enjoyed our first visit here.   Friendly server, she was great when we were too chatty and when were were too busy catching up and didn't take the time to look at the menu. She was really pleasant and friendly.   Food was good! I had the lamb sausage. Hollandaise sauce came on the side. 4 small pieces of toast came with it. I devoured the peas salad that had a crunch to it and opted not to finish the protein. I couldn't help it and ordered the radish fritters that was described as a savoury doughnut. That was yummy too. I would recommend sharing the fritters. Definitely a heavy dish and 3 fritters is too many for me personally.   My friend aims to return for dinner."}
{"text":"Me & Mine is a fantastic little brunch spot situated at College & Dundas. The inside gives off a sort of tiki/beachy theme, yet without being tacky.  Me & Mine really showcases the art of serving brunch outside of the typical norm of eggs benny, french toast, etc. You'll find that the menu is small, but creative and unique.  Everything I sampled was top notch, and made me want to come back to try everything else on the menu. I tried:  \"Cowboy\" sausage with a cauliflower cheddar bake, pickled cherries, green beans & wilted watercress. The sausage had a fantastic flavour, and went well with the cauliflower cheddar bake (which while heavy, was quite delicious.) I wasn't a fan of the pickled cherries & the way their flavour mixed with the bake, but that was easily rectified by picking them off. Whatever the green beans were seasoned with rocked, and made these little suckers addictive.  Apple & Cheddar Galette: Delicious. Perfect mix of sweet & savoury. I would buy these in bulk, if I could!  Trout with Poppyseed & Buckwheat Pancakes: served with a delicious scallion yoghurt cheese, these pancakes were quite tasty. The trout was the star though - cooked to perfection.  Freshly baked peanut butter cookie with housemade jam: the cookie was still warm when I got it. Smear that jam on the cookie and it is a little bite of heaven. Mmm.  You can get a side of pork belly here for $3 - what a steal! The pork belly ROCKS. Order it - you won't be disappointed.  I'd say the only flaw I encountered here was the service. While the service was super duper friendly and sweet, they were very understaffed. It took us a very, very long time to get our bill after we were finished eating and made ordering a 2nd drink a bit tricky. Keep in mind they just opened, so I'm sure this is a problem that will be rectified in the near future.  Overall a fantastic addition to the area. I hear they are opening for dinner service shortly and I am super excited to come back & check it out!"}
{"text":"This has become our \"goto\" restaurant. The place looks and feels simple and homey. The music is nice. The people working there are great and the food is always always good.   You'll get creative and slightly weird comfort food where you're eating something you know with a bit of something new to it. Always delicious and filling and you can tell there's some craft going on here. The meat pies are especially stand out for me."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting menu for only $40 per person. The ingredients weren't overly sophisticated but the dishes were creative, tasty and thoughtfully prepared. The homemade sausages were to die for. I would also recommend the rabbit terrine and chocolate pudding."}
{"text":"Win!  Very good food, cottage country wholesome goodness with lots of flavour and some unique touches. Fun drinks, nice simple interior, fun staff.   Go for it, don't wait until it's too popular!  Anthony"}
{"text":"Quiet little place with lovely brunch food. Service is excellent . They are organic, vegetarian n gluten free options ."}
{"text":"Honestly, so delicious! I will go back for sure! Great atmosphere and great service! Super delicious gluten free options, at least for dinner anyway!"}
{"text":"The Date was January 1st, 2015. My girlfriend woke me up early \"you never take me out!  Why can't you be more like my ex, Steve. Steve was so cool and good looking\".  I have pretty much accepted that she's going to leave me - but I want to cling to this situation and stretch out the inevitable. I decided to take her to brunch.  I know these cool hipsters and they recommended Me & Mine.  To be honest, it was kind of obnoxious. Deconstructed McMuffins, beet infused butter, \"seasonal cheese\".  I just wanted me some bacon and toast with jam. I thought I made a mistake with this place...until the food came.   Let me be clear. I would fight a bear to eat that brunch again. I would make out with the bear if it was declawed and I thought he liked me. I really liked how the food tasted in my mouth, and especially eating it and having it in my stomach.   I truly loved that brunch, and this came at a time when I was starting to doubt if I would ever be able to love that way again. I felt like Cuba Gooding Jr. in Boyz n The Hood, when that racist black cop shoved a gun in his neck and made him cry. However, instead of being upset about racism in the ghetto, I was happy about the great Brunch I had at Me & Mine."}
{"text":"I came her for dinner, not brunch so perhaps that may account for my \"A-OK\" rating. Came here with a group of friend (four persons in total) and after hearing really good reviews we came here for dinner. We had heard that the partners here, Melissa and Joel were previously partners in charge at Zocalo (which we really like!). We decided to order in a similar fashion as we are used to at Zocalo (sharing platter) since the Menu looked similarly inspired with in house made sausages and cured meats. We were a little disappointed in the serving portions for the price. I know I shouldnt compare but, I find Zocalo much more generous with their servings. The food was okay, but we were definitely not dazzled by anything on the menu, except maybe the appetizer spicy meatballs (3).  Food was alright, but I wouldn't specifically come here again.  (Maybe if I tried their brunch first I'd have a different rating, who knows)."}
{"text":"Different and sweet little brunch place.  Food are cooked perfect and right seasoning. The free watermelon starter was very refreshing too    Hope they had more different juice or drinks, that would made it even more special.   We Will comeback again!"}
{"text":"It has been several weeks since I requested a copy of their brunch menu, and my message was never acknowledged. I never understood how or why a restaurant would ignore a customer - if you do not want to give me your menu, then just tell me that. Don't just ignore the message! Such a shame."}
{"text":"What a gastric victory! My daughter and I found this place by accident, walking by in our search for a good breakfast restaurant, and we couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. The eggs Benedict were superb, with all homemade fixings and condiments. House pickled peppercorn pork patty sausage with pesto (we asked the server to say that three times fast, and she obliged), amazing savory garlic-beet butter (and I hate beets on the best of days),... Every bite a pleasure. Service was great, and the atmosphere is casual, with a bit of a hipster vibe -- but not over the top. Give it a chance: You won't be disappointed."}
