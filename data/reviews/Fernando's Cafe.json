{"text":"Fernando's Cafe is an excellent place to stop in and have lunch or dinner if your looking for good pizza or hoagies.  It really doesn't look like much but in the inner city life they tend to be the best places to stop.  The pizza if a good fair price and tastes excellent.  Their sandwiches are plenty good and they are not cheap with their toppings. The daily deals are well worth stopping back for. The staff if really laid back and a good group of people.  If you're in town for a convention they are in full support of most of what cones to town."}
{"text":"Most of Downtown Pittsburgh unfortunately closes down on holidays and the day before a holiday; however, Fernando's Cafe was fortunately open on Christmas Eve, so this is where I went for lunch today.

Because it's Christmas Eve, the store was pretty empty. The staff were friendly and the food came out in a timely manner.

I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, which was today's special - A foot long with a pop and chips / cookie cost $7.25 (the same as your $5 foot long meal).  Although the preparation is longer than your Subway / Jimmy John's, the wait is worth it!

My only complaint about the food is the messiness of the sub. It could be because I like to add a little hot sauce and ranch to my buffalo chicken sandwich, but it was a little messy to eat - make sure to have napkins handy.

Fernando's offers more than subs such as soups, salad, and pizza, so I will be sure to go back for lunch again."}
{"text":"I checked out their menu online prior to taking an Uber to get there as I was visiting the city from out of town. Upon arrival, I see a totally different menu than what was advertised online. When I showed the menu online to the staff, he said they changed the menu for the weekend and I could not order from their regular menu. ALL of the items were listed for twice as much as what was listed online. Stay away from these crooks!"}
{"text":"I'm upgrading my last review after my recent trip to Fernando's!

The staff was efficient, but much friendlier this time, I had the foot long baked pastrami and swiss.  It was great!  There were reasonable amounts of the key ingredients, and loaded me up with vegetables.  It was $7 or $8 with mini bag of chips and a large fountain soda. I thought it was a pretty good value for the dollar.

It was hot, fresh, and delicious. I was glad I went!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the pizza here! Large portions at a cheap price. I usually order a small pizza for lunch, and the cheese is so gooey and delicious. I didn't rate them a 5, because the service here can be off."}
{"text":"Fernando's is a wonderful place to stop in for a bite to eat. The wait staff are quite friendly if you take the time to speak with them, and the food is delicious. We host monthly gatherings at the restaurant with the blessing of the owner and staff, and everyone is excited to come back month after month for another lasagna wrap or sub. I've found their gourmet pizza to be to-die-for. 

They changed their hours last summer to capture more business, and I think it's only helped them out. It's certainly brought myself and my friends their way more often than during AC every summer."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Who just offers smoked turkey and not regular turkey? I then went for the roast beef American and they were out of cheese at 11:30 in the morning. They didn't ask if I wanted my bread toasted, but it came that way."}
{"text":"Fernando's is that place downtown that you walk by on multiple occasions and you just don't notice it.  I can't really tell you the reason why you would walk by this place without giving it a second look, nor can I explain how I came this far in life without noticing it before.  It looks almost exactly like all other pizza joints located within the Golden Triangle with the same selection of food offered.  Not quite sure why it flies under the radar, but it really shouldn't.

I think the thing that sets this place apart is the quick service that is presented with a smile.  I walked in during festival time in full swing and they did not falter at all.  I ordered my food, went to the cooler to retrieve my drink and by the time I made it back to the counter my food was ready for me to chow down on.

Pizza is pizza, when you crave it you really want it.  This really hit the spot when I was tired of walking and needed to fill my energy tank so I could keep going.  Not too salty, sauce was great and the crust had that thin crispy crunch you like to hear when you bite into it.  Being on Liberty Ave downtown makes for some great people watching as well.  Sit back and you kind of get a meal and entertainment all in one.  Definitely a place to stop for a quick bite to eat if you are downtown."}
{"text":"Time to update Fernando's Cafe here!  After having to eat soup yesterday because of an upset tummy, I wanted to have a real sammitch for lunch!  Mmmm!  Hot pastrami and Swiss cheese!  Load that baby up with onions too!  Hey, now we're talkin'!   Fernando's does have some of the best sandwiches Downtown--way better than Subway \"Eat Bland\" Sandwiches or Jimmy Johns!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza I have ever eaten in my life. I come here every year when I go to Pittsburgh. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Not my first choice for late night pizza slices in downtown Pittsburgh. 

The Cafe was empty at 10 pm  on a Saturday night and they offered pizza by the slice. It was close to the hotel I was staying for the night and reason for the visit. 

Expensive slice my I add. $12 for three slices. I am not a coke person so I did not purchase a drink. 

I don't think I would ever return nor recommend. The pizza was ok, nothing exciting, nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Walked in the room was filled with smoke. The person shoved a dog food bowl into my hand and said \"since you're with the con, you get this.\" I asked what was good they said \"since you're from the con, lasagna wrap.\" So I ask for that and they give me something about the size of a Taco Bell bean burrito covered in dry melted cheese. The combo had a bag of chips and a soda. Soda machine was out of ice. Lasagna inside was dry.

Total cost of meal w/plastic dog bowl I got for \"being with the con:\" over 16 dollars."}
{"text":"I opted to come into Fernando's on a Thursday, when they have a lunch special of a 12\" wrap or sandwich, fountain drink, and bag of chips for $7.50.  I opted for the lasagna wrap, which was mostly just intriguing.  The wrap contained meatballs, pepperoni, spices, and ricotta cheese, and mozzarella cheese on the outside.  The actual wrap was really dried out and kind of eh, but the ingredients inside were pretty good.  They have standard fountain drinks and iced tea, and there were lots of different chips to choose from.  The food was nothing special, but it fills a void.

Fernando's is basically a local version of Subway, with some slightly different sandwich options.  The set up is the same, and the cleanliness is about the same as a Subway.  So if you are looking to help local business instead of the chains, check this place out."}
{"text":"I disagree with Darren. The buffalo chicken pizza was pretty good as was my macaroni salad and the Oreo cheesecake. The only thing was that it took 90 minutes to get to us. Other than that, they're a solid delivery option with a wide range."}
{"text":"The only time I ever see this place is during Anthrocon, so my experience may be a lot different from other Yelpers. What I noticed is even though the restaurant is busy during the convention, they have extra staff behind the counter to keep the line moving. That said, their subs are average at best. I actually do like the place more for breakfast than for lunch or dinner because at breakfast time, I can get a whopping big pile of ham, sausage, bacon and egg on a bun, and the coffee is free. The only thing that seemed sketchy to me is on the third day of the convention, I noticed that they taped over the part of the menu where it says chips and drink come with a combo meal."}
{"text":"They were about to close in like 15 - 30 mins when we arrived. We got the slice of pepperoni pizza. It was overwhelming greasy, I didn't even want to eat the rest of the pizza. I know pizza is suppose to be a little bit greasy, but this was just horrible. I felt like I dipped myself in grease after having a few bites of the pizza."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting I can't believe I ate this pizza look at the state of the restroom"}
{"text":"Service took about an hour and half when the guy on phone said it would take 45 mins. Order from this place if you can enjoy waiting for your food that long"}
{"text":"I stopped at Fernando's during lunch time on a Friday.  It was bustling like many of the places downtown during lunch.  There was a line like expected, but it moved very efficiently and the people behind the counter were direct, but not in any way rude.  They ask if you want all the normal toppings in a nice way and didn't seem to mind many people not wanting different toppings.  The place was tidy and what'd you expect out of a sandwich shop.
Now the food.  They have a daily lunch specials that make a sandwich a \"meal\" by adding a fountain drink and a bag of Herr's chips.  I ordered the Sante Fe Steak Taco wrap and allowed them to put everything on it that they normally do -- tomatoes, black olives, mild peppers, lettuce, steak, and cheese.  Next time I think I will opt for jalapenos.  The wrap was toasted, but was really soggy and did not end up looking anything like the pictured wrap, man that pictured wrap looked so toasty and delicious.  My wrap was good don't get me wrong, but I was hoping for more.  It was a good size for a good price and they throw in any dipping sauce you want, I got their house Southwestern.  I really liked what I saw from the subs coming out for other people, so I will go to Fernando's again soon and grab a sub.  Maybe I'll even update update my rating.  
Again it's losing stars only for the sogginess.  Go check out Fernando's to replace your Subway or Jimmy John's sub.

***Edit***

Ordered the Bacon Beef and Cheddar toasted sub.  It was good, but again just not great.  I still prefer Fernando's over DiBellas, Jimmy Johns, and Subway as far as sub places downtown.  It just falls short when stacked up against other sub places."}
{"text":"I'm not going to get into why I avoided dining at Fernando's when I've had the opportunity, but when Kay didn't feel like cooking this evening, and a flyer in the Pennysaver revealed that they delivered to Beechview (among many other neighborhoods!), we decided to take a leap off the stage...and nobody caught us. Ouch. 

Yup, 90 minutes (no kiddin'!) after we spoke to the genial lady on the phone (the coupons had the wrong expiration date on them), our barely lukewarm food arrived.

Fernando's Roast Beef & American sub was the only stand-out. A sweet \"homemade Southwest dressing\" that came off as Russian or Thousand Island complimented the supple, better-than-Arby's roast beef wonderfully. A bun that tasted freshly-baked, and of course American cheese and good 'ol l-t-o finished off what was a dandy of a grinder. Fernando's needs to stick with hoagies and nothing but. 

My side of potato salad tasted like chilled mashed potatoes with some mayonnaise folded into them. 

The four shrink-wrapped, Chips Ahoy-sized chocolate chip cookies I had for dessert cost me $2 and seemed to have been half-baked. 

The true dud of the entire meal was the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, however. On top of what was a strange sort of synthetic flatbread (see my review for the Bridgeville Philly Soft Pretzel Factory location) were cubes of \"grilled\" chicken breast that had that tasted to have been boiled, a BBQ sauce that probably came from a bottle, a dull provolone/mozzarella/Romano blend, and raw vegetables (onions,mushrooms, green peppers). The advertised garlic was as invisible as a Stealth bomber. 

So, I'm gonna have to go with a \"no\" on Fernando's, okayyy? Yeahhh...

I've seen \"Office Space\" a few too many times, yes, but I'm sure Lumberg would concur with my evaluation."}
{"text":"For 3 bucks a slice of pepperoni, that was a good slice of pizza. I was there at 11:30, the day after Christmas so it wasn't really crowded. But, I did like the pizza. That was the only thing I had there so I can only judge on that.

People were nice, got my order up quick.

If I get a chance to I'll stop by again."}
{"text":"Great lunch for a low price! I ordered the turkey bacon swiss wrap, and it was really good. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is nostalgic, but not great. Reheated pizza, off-brand chips,  things heated on a small rolling grill, a drink machine that never has enough carbonation and I've felt off every time I've eaten there. They are nostalgic for mw and they were to first to open up their arms to the furries at Anthrocon, but that's only worth 2 stars."}
