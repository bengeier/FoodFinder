{"text":"PRICEY!! 28 bucks for 4 pretzels and small sodas.   Most games are $0.50 - $1.00!!  Even Dave and Buster's is cheaper!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from New York and decided to bowl with family. On the bowling end...what a great experience! Fun atmosphere and music! The bartender however had to have been on drugs. There was literally one customer in front of me and she took forever! I only ordered two beers...they cost $9.01. How bizarre. She took a lifetime to count back my 99 cents. I am a bartender and feel justified saying they should hire a drug free employee,  it's a shame to let her ruin an otherwise fun time!"}
{"text":"By far one of the cleanest establishments we've been too. We have been here on a weekly basis for the past month and every time we're here during the day the staff is on their hands and knees (literally) cleaning and scrubbing every nook and cranny (the lights,  the bar seats.) You can't beat the early bird bowling special with two hours of unlimited bowling for only $8 a person. Great for kids. The food is not the best but certainly expectable for bowling alley food . We will be back!!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Pittsburgh for a couple of years, I visited this location a few times for different (adult) birthday parties.  The laser tag was always a blast, and the food was  good, especially the pizza.  I also thought it was fun that they served beer here.  I know that they work with a lot of local nonprofits on fundraisers, which I think is excellent for community involvement.  I'm looking forward to seeing all of the new additions scheduled for 2015, excited for bumper cars!"}
{"text":"Went to fun fest for some late night bowling. Two games were 25 dollars! What? The atmosphere was strange. Everyone from families to people in their 20s out drinking. Right next to an arcade with kids playing, it looked kind of dumpy. Although the lanes were pretty cool, I probably won't be back"}
{"text":"I went there this weekend with my niece for the first time since it was remodeled. We bowled in the VIP area and it was so cool! It was nice to have more privacy and less people around when trying to chase a three year old around. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went here for maybe the second time tonight and, I gotta say, I loved it. There are a decent amount of bowling lanes all lit up, a restaurant, two bars, laser tag and an escape room coming Feb 2018. The kids I went with loved all the arcade game varieties and the laser tag was reasonably priced. I've come here before to do bowling at night with my friends and loved it as well. If I had the choice of coming here again, I'd do it in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Fun time in the VIP room, but everything except the bathrooms is updated and they are gross!! Do your business before you come. Don't take the risk!!"}
{"text":"I took my family there for a night out and we had an absolute blast. The staff was really nice and even helped us get started at our lane. My kids used the bumpers and the cool thing was that the bumpers went up for the kids and down for my wife and I. The other cool thing was my kids appeared on the giant video screens over the lanes as they must have a camera. It was like being on the jumbo tron at a ball game. We also played games and Laser Tag. The food was pretty good and I noticed that they have all kinds of specials for the family that we will surely taake advantage of in the future. I had a great time as my my did also."}
{"text":"We had our company holiday party here and let me tell you, it was like having a 10 year Olds birthday party with how much fun we had!  The arcade games were great and there is Lazer tag (sadly we didn't get to play! ) the pizza was the BEST bowling alley pizza I have had in a very long time!"}
{"text":"We went back with a group of friends for the late night bowling last Saturday night and our trip was a complete 180. Great service, clean lanes we had a great time!"}
{"text":"Funfest is a great place for bowling! no matter if you are a family, couple, group of friends.  Really great staff and really fun.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and two kids were looking for something to do for the weekend so we decided to go bowling. Number 1: cosmic bowling is not fun it's just annoying even my kids found it annoying. Number 2: it is waaaay too expensive. The following week we went to the bowling alley in west deer and had a much better time and far less expensive. The laser tag is a joke there as well. That used to be a pretty cool place but has gone downhill. The kids that work in arcade are just plain rude. Had enough of that place they will never see another dime from me."}
{"text":"Fun Fest Center is an outstanding place to hold a kids birthday party.  As an example - I was invited to Sammy's birthday party last week.  In full disclosure, I don't get invited to many birthday parties these days, so it was a treat to attend.  This is a large venue with many different activites sure to thrill kids.  They must have something like two dozen bowling lanes, and who doesn't like bowling?  The large arcade has all kinds of different fun games for kids, including skiball and other games which rewards players with redeemable tickets for toys at the end.  Then they of course have a laser tag arena which is awesome - an indoor dark maze of walls and glow in the dark lights.  When decked out in their fighting gear kids end up looking like martians.  This venue has many seperate private party / dining areas, so you can have your group eating lunch and birthcake all together.  The staff was on point and friendly.  They make kids smile - and that is to be commended.  I don't have kids, but if I did - 6th year birthday party would take place at Fun Fest Center."}
{"text":"I tried to like this place.  I went there for the 2nd time last evening and it will probably be the last.  It's a shame, they seemed to have made a lot of upgrades and it's close to my home.  The Good:  the staff is friendly.  They seem to employee younger folks, and they have always been polite and helpful.  It's always been hectic and busy on my visits and the staff keeps up with the work.  They seems to have invested a lot into the technology of the bowling lanes.  Tons of nice new screens, terminals, and the like (although ours was giving us issues last night and we had to reset a few times, taking away from our bowling time which is a by the hour rate.).  If you have a group of 5 you can split the cost and it's quite affordable.  The Bad.  FOOD.  This place is ridiculous when it comes to food prices.  Last night I ordered chicken tenders (I got 4 small pieces), a piece of pizza, order of fries and 2 fountain sodas...came to $21.  These are frozen, throw in the deep fryer, fast food type items.  To make matters worse, as the cashier was ringing up my items I noticed they were coming up at different prices that what are listed on their menu (it's a giant screen, digital-can be updated easily).  My chicken tenders were listed at 6.99..rang up at 7.99.  2.75 pizza, rang up $3, and so on.  $4 bottles of domestic beer, $3 drafts...this isn't an upscale craft brew artisan dining establishment, I have no idea what they are thinking.  I can't imagine taking a group of children here for a family outing, it would be well over a hundred dollars to bowl and feed a family of 4 and bowl for 2 hours.  *4/6/16-I should mention that I didn't bring the error in pricing to the attention of the cashier at my time of purchase.  He seemed a bit busy, and appeared to be 16(ish), I didn't want to further burden him having to get his manager or add to to his tasks.  I just wanted my food to be prepared (he had to ring it up and then go make it).  I should have taken the time to bring this to the attention of the staff at my visit.  Even if my price would have been adjusted to the menu pricing it was still waaaaay over what I'm willing to pay at a bowling alley."}
{"text":"The most high tech bowling I have ever seen! They play music video along side of the bowling screen and have images of Pittsburgh above the lanes. They have cosmic (glow) bowling as well as bumper cars and laser tag. I am unsure of pricing since I was there for a fundraiser. Overall, very clean with friendly staff and spacious lane areas for hanging out."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was decent . The bowling is good too... first time here. It's neat because you can take s picture for when your name pops up when it's your turn! the bathrooms ... are disgusting though. They reek. There is shit literally encrusted on the toilet seats... every single one. Also, a piece of shit on the ground. Mind you, we came at 11 am... so it's not like it was \"after a long day\"... I think if the bathrooms were more sanitary, I would be a bigger advocate for this place. Not sure if their prices are a good deal either. I wouldn't necessarily advocate for this place. But it wasn't terrible. Update : Bartender was nice  Update: Toilet leaked on me"}
{"text":"Ok. Before you are heading out, ask yourself a few questions....  1) do I have children 2) do I like fried foods 3) do I want to step on a 3 year olds finger near the arcade space  If you can answer yes to all three of these questions, this place is for you! Soooo many kids. So many unsupervised kids. This place actually made me very nervous. My husband and I ventured out to this location for our nephews birthday party. We have a 3 month old, so we took him along. I literally almost tripped over multiple kids. The staff were not saying to any of the children, don't run, don't lay on the floor...it was just a free for all.   The food was o k. It is all fried. They have a couple of salads. I don't recommend coming too hungry because you will just eat a bunch of snacks.   It's a bit messy as well. I believe I saw a couple gnats at the bar.   Now the 8 year old whose party it was loved it. They have a nice party room in the back where kids can host functions. They assign waitstaff for your particular party and they are to help with everything. The young lady assigned to us did just that."}
{"text":"We had my son's 5th birthday party in the VIP Suite 28.  Planning with Tina went great.  She was very responsive and prompt.  However, when we got to FunFest on the day of my son's party she was not there and the manager who was there had no idea what she was doing.  We arrived at 9:30 a.m. to set up for the party but the manager kept telling us that we did not have the space reserved and it was reserved for another party.  After I briefly panicked, I showed her proof that the party was booked and deposit paid for under my name.  She did not know what to do and asked if I needed all of the lanes because the other party needed them.  I said, \"Yes, I need all of the lanes.  I paid for all four lanes.\"  She then proceeded to tell me that they needed to put up the separation wall in the party room but that we could start setting up.    The floors were sticky, the trash hadn't been empty or cleaned from their last party.  They were scrambling to get it in decent shape as we were trying to set up.  We went to use the restroom and there was a spilled cup of beer laying on the floor (I guess from the previous night) and the drain cover was displaced from a drain in the floor causing a big hole in the floor as soon as you walked in.  After we told them about this, they took care of it.  I would think they would have a cleaning service come in before they would open for business the next day but, I guess not.    I rented the VIP space because there was a bar with a soda fountain in that space but the unlimited soft drinks I paid for came in pitchers from a different location.  I would not complain about this if I would have paid for a regular room but why are you not utilizing the soda fountain that is right in our space?  I also ordered unlimited Icee drinks and thought that they would have the machine set up in that space since it was one of the options offered.  Again, no.  They brought us Icee drinks in pitchers and when we went to pour them they were frozen and nothing would come out.  Our poor party attendant had to spend all his time going back and forth filling up Icee drinks for my guests in individual cups.    The party attendant was great but was unprepared in terms of knowing what we had ordered ahead of time.  Our party should have been relayed to the staff the day before so that everyone could have been prepared for our arrival.    Also, I was under the impression when I booked the space that I would have the entire VIP space for my party.  That was not the case as the other party was there.  I did speak with Tina beforehand though and she let me know about the other party that was going to be there.  But, you could tell by the faces of the people from the other party that they did not know that my party was going to be in that space at the same time as theirs.  This should really be made clear on the website during booking the space.  My guests didn't notice most of these hiccups which I am glad but I certainly did not appreciate what I had to go through that morning to make sure everything was right.    Overall, would I rent the space again?  Probably not.  But, my son and his guests very much enjoyed it so it was worth the frustrations in the end."}
{"text":"I love ALL the employees at this business.  They are all fantastic (for the most part).  BUT it is extremely expensive.  You must be sure to always get a coupon before you go here.  Whether on their facebook page or their website.  The games are getting better slowly but surely.  Bowling is always fun :)"}
{"text":"I would just love to give a round of applause for Zone 28 for helping myself & a group of my classmates last minute with the booking of a large group for a reunion when our other venue cancelled on us very last minute. The manager (sorry, I forgot your name!) graciously offered the VIP section for our party as well as being able to provide drink tickets all at last minute & during a busy Friday at that. Kudos to you Zone 28 for coming through for us!"}
{"text":"For some reasons they would rather put QVC on than the penguins playoff game. Not sure why they can't have the Penguins game volume on in the bar and have the game on both TVs during the PLAYOFFS. Even asked the manager and he told the bartender, \"you know how I feel about that.\" Might I add there is only two people in the bar area."}
{"text":"I stopped for lunch at the rail house restaurant, sat at the bar and ordered a draft, then I ordered the applewood bacon burger well done. I received my food and took a bite , just a little pink no biggie , took a second bite and just got more rare it was actually cold in the middle. So after sitting idle for 15 minutes waiting for a server to come back around and check on me, I sent it back. Then they still were going to charge me, after getting the manager involved and credited for the burger I paid my tab and left. First impressions are everything for me wont be going again"}
{"text":"Nice bowling and laser tag -- HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Spent over 200.00 in bowling, beer, and laser tag for 6 people and asked to play teams rather than solo. Associate nicely said no. Manager also said no with an explanation of \"it's for your safety.\" I said everyone playing (10 ppl) want to play teams... His response, \"you make your own teams once it starts.\" IN THE DARK?!?! Bottom line, care about the customers want and do something about it!! Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Simply terrible,  the kids had fun but I did not.  We were the only ones there on the day that we went. There was no music playing and a lot of the games were broken and keep money from the kids. I had high hopes for Funfest because I remember going here on school field trips and having a blast. This place is in need of some serious repair. Everything seems really out dated and used. Like the owners are just too cheap to replace or fix what needs to be fixed.  The bowling is very expensive here. I had to pay $70.00 for bowling they charge extra for using the bumpers.  Funfest is gross and run down.  I am giving two stars because the pizza was good and it's very spacious inside."}
{"text":"FYI the free game of bowling offered by Yelp is not accepted or recognized at zone 28- they young man behind the bowling counter even asked the manager who said no this offer is not accepted.  I took my 6 year old daughter and 4 year old nephew- we bowled and it was a lot of fun and the lanes have bumpers accessible. Then we hit the game area where the kids played ice ball(skee ball) for about an hour. Only 25 cents per game! The place is a lot of fun and both kids left happy- I really wish the yelp free bowling offer was accepted"}
{"text":"I dare you to try and order food and drinks at the bar area here on a Saturday night. Not possible on under 3 hours. Place is an absolute joke and only exists because the closest bowling alley it's in lower Burrell"}
{"text":"Our son had a friend's birthday party at Zone 28 this evening. The kids had a great time bowling!!! While we waited for the party, we grabbed an appetizer and dessert at the restaurant inside Zone 28, called Rail House Restaurant. Service was very slow but we didn't mind as we had time to spare. We will definitely come back and try the new Escape Room."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Got ripped off. The bumper cars and laser tag were not open. The machines kept eating our money and coins. When we showed up they gave us a bowling lane that had about 11 people still at it and it took them about 20 minutes to clean up and then took that off of our time. The pins were not setting up properly. The service was terrible in the food area. They took our drinks without asking. We spent a lot of money tonight and it was not worth it at all. I felt very ripped off and not was not treated fairly at all."}
{"text":"Our oldest has been having his birthday here for the last four years. Continues to be a hit with the kids and since we like donuts over cake this place is great!"}
{"text":"One of the nicer bowling alleys on this side of the city, but there are some major staffing and logistical issues. Even on busy nights the bar is usually staffed with only one bartender and it takes quite a while to be served. Melissa was also one of the rudest bartenders I've ever dealt with, very bad attitude and doesn't seem to know pleasantries such as \"please\" and \"thank you.\"   The check-in process for a lane is also unusually slow and convoluted. They have a special that starts at a certain time on weekends but require the lanes to be cleared before it begins?? Even if you don't mind paying the normal (higher) rate, you're required to give up the lane by the time the special starts. They'll make you wait 40 minutes until the special starts to get a lane.   If they could clean up the logistical problems and establish some basic customer service, it would be a great place."}
{"text":"Super fun! This place is always clean and welcoming, and their bar is amazingly well stocked for a bowling alley.  They have TONS of beers on draft. The only downside is that it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Got severe attitude from both bartenders for no reason. My food got taken away and took over an hour for pretzels. Then one bartender told me she was done and couldn't serve me and then proceeded to serve a guy next to me! Either they don't like girls or they didn't like me, but I literally just asked nicely for food and drinks. Pretty weird."}
{"text":"Just scrolling through the first page of reviews I'm seeing some really good ones and some really bad ones. I guess mine is going to be a really good one. We had dinner at the Railhouse Restaurant (separate review) and we had planned on just going into the bowling area to check it out after dinnner, but the waitress gave us each $5 in arcade tokens (comes on a gift card thing) and off we went. I'm not a huge fan of all those games there, I typically find them too hard, not fun, and you never win any significant amount of tickets. This arcade had the same sort of games (Kung fu Panda game I'm looking at you) but some of the ones I liked were the Deal or no Deal, skee ball, basketball hoops, and they had a knock down the clowns game but it was super popular so we didn't play it. We spent most of our time on the penny pusher game.  We ended up loading $10 more on one of our cards. We spent about 1.5 hours there. It was a lot of fun!  Yes, it was super crowded and at times hard to walk around the games and the people since the games are very close together. But it was a Saturday night, what do you expect. There were also a lot of kids there, but duh it's a place for kids. So what if they are a little rambunctious, deal with it. I actually was more annoyed at some of the adults there than the children. Will possibly return for the arcade and to try laser tag but not the bowling because it didn't seem like the best deal to me. They are also getting an escape room this month and we love escape rooms so we will probably check that out as well."}
{"text":"People hate this place but I actually enjoy it. It fulfills my need to gamble but it's with kids and the prizes are inexpensive Chinese plastic toys.   I have no idea why this is appealing but it's fun.   My daughter and I had a blast playing air hockey, giant Connect Four and a ski ball. I guess it just reminds me of going to Chuck E Cheese when I was a kid.  They have laser tag and bowling too! My daughter loved it and we had a great time connecting."}
{"text":"Ok, I have to admit it.. this place is fun!   It's kind of like a low-key, less expensive Dave and Busters, but truthfully I had more fun here than I ever have at a D&B!  We decided to stop in because it was my younger brothers 14th birthday and as many times as we had driven by on our way to and from Pittsburgh Mills, we finally had a reason to check it out! It was about 8pm on a Tuesday evening and when we walked in, there was a small crowd (mainly families and teens) with plenty of space to spread out. The bowling lanes are really nice and all of the equipment is new and in good working order. The bowling is updated and modern, and while you have all the classic fun of bowling, they've adapted to the times and spiced it up a bit (some bowling alleys have done this and some havent.. but this is the nicest we've seen and been to recently).  They provide you with that fun, \"cosmic bowling\"-ish atmosphere, without having to stay out late or wait til the weekend.  There's a full bar and a full food menu as well. The games are set up D&B style, where you load money onto a card and use that to play games (they don't charge for purchase of the card, btw!). They also offer bumper cars and laser tag, the latter of which we took full advantage of! We played 2 games of bowling ($25 for an hour per lane, including shoes.. not bad considering there were 3 of us), and then we played 2 games of laser tag ($10/ 15 min game for 2 games, $7 for 1 game). We had an absolute blast with the laser tag! I've never played before, but of course my 2 male counterparts were practically pros haha.. all 3 of us were sweating after the first game and needed a break because we played so hard lol! Now I don't have anything to compare it to, but it seemed pretty big to me! Lots of good equipment to choose from, clever theming, and thoughtful design/lay out! My 14 year old brother had a blast, as did my husband and I  (in fact I'd say it's safe to say we had just as much fun as the kid!).   We will definitely go back, with or without a teenager lol.. we liked the bowling alley more than any we've been to, and the games are an added bonus! What a fun way to spend a Tuesday night! I would definitely recommend Zone 28 to anyone looking for a fun place to go, regardless if your age or the reason.. the prices are just right and you'll have an great time.. what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"3 stars? BULLSCHEISSE.  FUN FEST.  And, that it is.   With trepidation, daughter and I trundled up 28 to go to Fun Fest for her birthday. Booking was easy; a helpful person helped me decide what package to get. Deposit of u$25 got a reservation.  We hit the road by 9:30 for a 10:15 party, with a stop to pick up cupcakes.   We were early. We didn't do anything other than find a parking space in the copious lot, scout out the place, and wait for our guests. Our perky host dealt well with a dozen 5yos thru disco light bowling, laser tag, guiding the children to grab a bite betwixt corralling them from this venue to that.   Pizza, more PGH style with thicker crust, but VERY edible. Wings, plain, but edible; parents made them disappear, as everyone did w/ the pizza. Vincents is still my fave, but this was what is available and it works, and works well.   Our space was neat and tidy, as was the place in general.   And, there is a bar. We hit the thing before it opened, but can DEF see slipping in for a quick one should an event be on when its open."}
{"text":"Please Give an option for no Stars or Minus Stars ....

If he is just an employee, he should be TERMINATED!  Watch your wallet!!!!!"}
{"text":"I joined a bowling league recently where we go to Zone 28 every Wednesday night. We use the VIP section which is very nice, and allows us to have regularly lighted lanes when the other lanes turn to a glow-in-the-dark atmosphere at night which is also cool for a date night or evening out. Even on Wednesday nights the lanes are usually at least 2/3 occupied and people are enjoying themselves at the bar/restaurant as well. The service is also very good, whenever there is a rare issue like a pin stuck in the gutter the attendant will come over to help quickly. My only slight complaint is the lanes do not always have good \"slide\"-when you release the ball, it helps for your front foot to slide rather than just land in place- to them. Some bowlers in the league will bring powder to help with that. It's not a huge deal, especially bowling just for fun, but takes some time to get used to.   I tried the pizza last time and it was good for a bowling alley. I usually eat beforehand but I was happy with how quick it came out, and the waitress brought it over to my lane so I didn't have to wait by the bar. The beers on draft are also good with a decent selection. I would recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"So expensive and not worth it at all.  Staff was rude.  Not a good experience.  Would not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Zone 28 (formerly Funfest) is transformed with a brand new Endzone Sports Bar, large selection of beers, great food.  I just had a wonderful, fresh, salad with grilled chicken for lunch. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So, we had one of our kids' birthday parties here a few weeks back, and have to say that it was the best birthday party experience we have had in town, and we have pretty much tried them all.  We were greeted by our hostess immediately upon arrival, and she made sure that everyone was well taken care of. The pizza we had ordered from them was actually pretty good for a bowling alley kitchen, and there were no leftovers. You do have to bring your own birthday cake, but there is a superb bakery across the river, so no worries.  The bowling was perfect for the kids - they have bumpers and also have a ramp for the littlest kids, so everyone is able to have lots of fun. Our hostess set up the computers, so it was very, very easy to have fun - we didn't have to worry about the details, and everyone was able to just enjoy it. The per-person cost also includes $5 on one of their cards, so the kids can enjoy the arcade / games for a little bit after the bowling and party wraps up.  Luckily, we didn't meet up with the ruffians and cutpurses others have described - didn't see anyone matching that description, just people running around and having fun. Apparently, we survived the assault of the fried foods too - perhaps they will start having VIP bottle service with truffled foie gras. Will definitely be back for other parties for our kids, especially since the service was so helpful and made our experience truly wonderful."}
{"text":"Our group got there at 11:00pm . For some reason, they charged us $22.00 each for the all-night pass, but it didn't start until 12:30. We just had to sit around for an hour and a half since everything was closed. Weird? Yup. Will we go back? Nope."}
{"text":"Visited Funfest for a \"Family Fun Day\"  The kids and adults, both enjoyed the time spent.  We found a Groupon for Funfest! How fabulous is that?!? Saving cash.    Bowling  was fun. The pizza  was delicious.   We had an ABSOLUTE blast!"}
{"text":"If we didn't ask for service, we would have been ignored all night. Apparently they are understaffed, which is difficult and I am sympathetic, however, they could have checked on us without us begging them to serve us."}
{"text":"Previously known as FunFest, Zone 28 has a slightly new look and feel, with some familiar favorites.   - Bowling, which has better computer systems than I remember and more kid-friendly features (e.g. automatic bumpers, tons of low-weight balls, etc.) - Bumper cars and laser tag - Brand new sports bar - VIP bowling area (can be rented for private events) - Snack bar - Three party areas (can be rented for private events)  - Billiards too - Arcade, which is packed with games for all ages - and most dispense tickets (tickets are easy to keep track of on your game card)  My chief complaint is the price as compared to other bowling alleys with similar amenities. Zone 28 is rather expensive for a small family. Expect to spend $40-60 just to bowl and grab a snack or play some games."}
