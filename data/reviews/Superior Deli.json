{"text":"Absolutely love the sandwiches there. Also the breakfast is good and cheap. Be sure to go early because the close in the afternoon."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch if you want a great corned beef sandwich but don't want to deal with the crowd two blocks away.  If you are around Superior you should defiantly stop by for lunch."}
{"text":"One of the greatest sandwich shops in Cleveland.  love the people and the food"}
{"text":"It is truly a hole in the wall restaurant and the corn beef is by far the best. The corn beef was moist and filling. I could only eat half a sandwich. I plan to go during the mornings for breakfast."}
{"text":"Best Corned Beef hands all the way down, everyone raves about Slymans that place doesn't hold a candle to Superior Delight. Fantastic Corned beef & nice people. Sandwich soon big we eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner,very moist and tender.. The only negative is the price 15$ for a sandwich but I guess you pay for Quality!! In my opinion Superior Deli has the best Quality Corned Beef in Cleveland.."}
{"text":"I love this place as many other clevelanders. And have been coming here years. However today was not a good day food excellent. Service NOT acceptable. HAND SANITIZER should be kept at the counter. The cashier was told by a customer before he would have to wait until she gets her money out.  After she gives him the money she puts her hand out. The cashier then tells the customer she now has to wait(he could have kept that statement to himself). Now its my turn order food as I'm get ready to pay the cashier COUGHS in his hand turns around to assist the sandwich maker by grabbing the bag napkins and utensils and puts them in bag. As he turns back to me to get my payment i state to him. You should use sanitizer before i could finish he states i don't handle the food. I stated u are handling other things its not just food that passes germs"}
