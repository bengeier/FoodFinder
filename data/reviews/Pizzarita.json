{"text":"Moved to area last week and needed carbs to fuel unpacking.  We ordered a large plain cheese pizza and a meatball sandwich.  The meatball sandwich hit the spot with bread that was nicely toasted, appropriate amount of meatballs (not skimpy but not overstuffed) and not overly salty.  The pizza was decent.  I enjoyed it cold more than I did it hot.  It would have been better with some red pepper or garlic, things that if we were dining in, we could have asked for.  I look forward to trying them again."}
{"text":"It has been a little more than a year since our last pizza from this establishment, due to the poor quality of food and customer service.  We were too tired to go out, so we thought we would give them another try.  Once again disappointed in the pizza.  They either have changed their crust from a year ago, or they ran out and had to buy a pre-made crust from the local grocery.  In either case, the crust was just like the pre-made crust you purchase in the dairy section of the grocery.  It was busy Saturday night, so maybe they ran out of real crust.  In any case, we won't return even if it is the last pizza place standing."}
{"text":"Have been going here since it opened and it is amazing. On Wednesdays they have $10 late plain pick up pizza and it's amazing. We always get extra sauce and extra cheese and it's always come out amazing. The service hasn't always been the best but when walking is and walking out to grab a pizza it doesn't doesn't bother me too much. 

Their mozzarella sticks and fries aren't too bad, but I wouldn't get them regularly. And they don't have breadsticks only garlic knots which kind of sucks because their knots aren't that good. All in all when looking for a classic cheese pizza this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Service is great. Delivery is fast.  Delivery kids are nice. They charge a $1.00 for delivery, so that comes off their tip.  12 wings are $12.00.  They just started posting their prices online and I understand why. They are very expensive.  Been there since 2012 and just put their prices out there.  Pasquales has 20 wings for $15.99 and 10 wings for $7.99.  They are just as good.  I was very disappointed tonight. I got wings. They were crunchy because they were reheated in the microwave then covered in sauce and the zuchhini (cold) was supposed to be batter dipped like tempura, but seemed breaded.  In addition, there was no taste to them at all.  I probably wont order from them again as they smidge on the pizza sauce too.   Too bad though cuz they are so close."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza, nothing special. I ordered a small plain pizza and it took 50 minutes to get to my house and I live 2 minutes away. I forgot to leave the driver a tip so I was going to head down to the shop to leave him a couple dollars. Before I put my shoes on he came back up to my door and asked for a tip. Classless."}
{"text":"Back for a second time and got Hoagies this time they were great! Order only took 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"Everyone has a different taste when it comes to pizza; what one will find delicious another will not. And I know because this happens to me every time. So I have to try for myself, first by the looks of a pizza, then there's flavor, of course. 

Pizzarita's pizza has the bubbles on the crust, which I find delicious. Not too greasy, not too cheesy, crunchy, thick and soft crust. 

They bought the old Burchifield Pizza. The inside has been redone, cleaned up and repainted but still needs an aura for a hangout/eat in place, in my opinion. There's a fig tree in a big pot by their large window, it gives me a reminder of what Italian really is. Some paintings on the walls would do the trick as the looks of this restaurant can be plain monotonous."}
{"text":"Boy... i don't know about this one. Got the white pizza... large just under 15 bucks. Called at 1745 and waited a good 5 minutes after being placed on immediate hold. Pizza was ready when stated and was a good looking pie in a generic box. Pizza was fairly bland and really didn't give much flavor at all. Especially the crust... cardboard. The cheese was the best part. I will give this place another try but, ordering a traditional pizza will be the order next time. I will only be giving this place another try simply for lack of options. 
Only 2 people were working and one single person was in the dining room.  It did look like an ok place to eat in but the entrance and parking lot were a challenge to get in and out of. 
Just eh."}
{"text":"I think the one star review is unfair and should be removed. That said, I'm happy PizzaRita is here! We have such a hard time finding good pizza and the folks here are happy to accommodate my special requests. 

I usually order a tomato pie (upside doen pizza), which is just crust then cheese then sauce on top. It's fantastic! I love the homemade crust and the crunchy and chewy texture. 

Their salads are also bountiful and full of quality ingredients."}
{"text":"1st time visitors. Clean and well lit and big inside. Ordered Italian hoagie and a yoho hoagie which is chicken , spinach, mushrooms and cheese. The chicken hoagie was huge for 10 bucks. Real grilled chicken breast, fresh spinach and fresh grilled mushrooms. This was seriously a sub that would put peppis, uncle sams , primantis to shame. Italian was super as well with home made mayo which had some spices added into it. The. Fresh cut fries were made perfectly and would put most places fries to shame as well. Pizza looked good . Give his place a shot , we went there and sat and ate and it was great."}
