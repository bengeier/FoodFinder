{"text":"Nice building, nice staff... But a little over priced, I took my two girls, they are younger 18mths and 3 years. The movie in the start was a bit much for the little ones, great if your older and can fully understand. The atrium is not to large but full of beautiful butterfly's. Kids loved them! But what they found most fun was the aquatic section. Over all OK... I most likely will NOT be back... However Not due to poor quality but mainly due to cost and feel of value are a little out..."}
{"text":"Very cool. They let you watch a very interesting 3D movie about monarch butterflies (optional) and see butterflies coming out of cocoons before going in with the actual butterflies.  Theres lots of them very beautiful with different  Shapes and colours!!   On your way out you get to see stingrays & different types of fishes in an almost mini aquarium - also a display of reptiles before the fishes.  Humid inside  Adult tickets are 20$"}
{"text":"Cool place, wife loved all the butterflies, 11 year old son really enjoyed the laser maze.  Won't return because of high prices, worth a one time visit though."}
{"text":"I went here on opening weekend (May 25th) with my friend and her two kids.  Prices are okay-$20 for adults, not sure how much she paid for her kids admission.  The 3D movie was awesome and a nice reprieve from the heat.  The cocoon exhibit was ok-kind of a funky smell but with animals/bugs-not like they can help it.  I was a little disappointed with the butterfly atrium as it didn't seem like they had a huge selection of species-we kept seeing the same kinds again and again.  The atrium was extremely humid, so ladies-get prepared for a facial!  The ant farm bee colony, and the 'aquarium' were small and nothing to write home about.  One thing we were super annoyed about was they had on their website that they had a cafe-it's more like a vending machine-pre-wrapped sandwiches and chips-grab lunch before you get here.  Her kids bought avocado sandwiches and it didn't have a speck of avocado in either sandwich-they gave her $ back and said they don't make the sandwiches there.  Bottom line-it's a one time thing, I'd probably not end up going back unless I had kids."}
{"text":"You can Not Sit in the atrium and not feel the magic of all the flutterbys!  They are spectacular and beautiful and wondrous for all ages."}
{"text":"The experience was nice but a tad pricey for admission fee.  It may be better if there were less people it was very cowed. so I guess if you are a large family it would be best to go during the week."}
{"text":"Anxious to see this new addition and knowing it was being marketed as the largest in the US., my family went on the second day it was open.  Admission for 2 adults and 1 child came to $52 and change, which made it more expensive than other local attractions.  Overall, we enjoyed the experience but it was not worth the money, especially when both the Phoenix Zoo and Desert Botanical Garden are a 15 minute drive away, both are cheaper, larger, provide much more to see and do for a longer period of time, and DBG has it's own Spring Butterfly Exhibit.  Our son enjoyed the 3D movie, and throughout our entire visit, was the most educational aspect provided - although it centered around Monarch butterflies and their migration only.  The Chrysalis Lab, which you visit next, was the highlight of the visit.  However, there was absolutely no information provided aside from the paper tags identifying the types of butterflies in each type of cocoon.  Because you visit this area directly after the movie and the entire theater is emptied directly into this room, you really only have the length of the next movie to enjoy yourself before being crowded in upon by the next incoming group.  Due to my family being at the back of our theater, by the time the room cleared out enough to give us a good view of the cocoons, we had about 5 minutes or so and then were swarmed by the next large group of people anxious to get a look and were crowded out.  The atrium itself was alright, but disappointing for what was being boasted about it.  It was hot and humid, as to be expected, and the vegetation has a lot of growing to do before it can even be considered as rainforest-y.  The butterfly guide provided when admission was paid was both lacking quite a few species which were spotted, and listed a handful which weren't identified anywhere.  Aside from the few guides answering questions for children and marking their punch cards (they received a prize at the end for having a completed punch card), there was absolutely no information, signage, etc. provided anywhere...which was disappointing.  The ant colony and bee exhibit were alright, but have potential to be much better.  There were a few native AZ species in a corner that looked like they were thrown in as an afterthought and were out of place.  The fish seemed as an odd addition, and were nothing spectacular.  All very common species of fish found at any chain pet store and in the center of the room was a touch tank with 4 very small stingray laying on the bottom of the pool.  Only one came up on occasion, and the moment it was touched, went straight back down to the bottom.  Not faulting the stingray and wanting to be left alone, but a lot more could be done with that exhibit if they want to make it memorable in any way.  Overall, a once-a-year-if-that sort of place unless you REALLY like butterflies.  It was expensive, and didn't provide enough for more than 1 1/2 to 2 hours of entertainment in its entirety.  Other valley organizations are cheaper, and have a lot more to offer.  I'll wait until the Odyssey Aquarium is built next to it, before ever venturing back over to that area."}
{"text":"Ooooh butterfly wonderland! This was a really fun date for my boyfriend and I, and it was something new we had never experienced before. Butterflies sound so romantic and pretty, right?  WRONG. When they land on you, it is scary. Every time a butterfly got close to us we were both a little \"flighty\" (hahahahah). We were very worried about stepping on them, too, so we spent a lot of time staring at the ground. We were about half way through the misty butterfly garden when my boyfriend said \"OH  MY GOSH. DON'T. MOVE.\"  There was  a butterfly on my neck. There was a butterfly on my neck! I whimpered while he took a picture, holding my neck in an awkward position to accommodate the little guy. My boyfriend laughed until it finally flew away. He kept making jokes about it UNTIL he looked down and discovered the same butterfly lounging on the side of his shorts. Then he didn't find it so funny. Ha!   Once we got our courage back and made peace with a few butterfly landings, we really enjoyed finding the different types of butterflies and hanging out in the garden. We got some nice butterfly pictures, too. So, yes, this is a great date place for me. Good memories."}
{"text":"What an unusual place to visit! A large atrium type building swarming, literally, with thousands of butterflies. All types, colors and sizes flying everywhere. It's almost creepy! I was afraid that I was going to step on them as they land everywhere. It was an incredible experience and a camera is a must. I don't know about going in the summer, as it was very humid and warm in there in March. I think this is something everyone should experience. Only annoying part: watching people pick them up after being specifically told not to."}
{"text":"I went here with my seven year old daughter on a Sunday afternoon, and we had a great experience.  The short 3d movie that you watch before you go into the atrium was actually really interesting, we both loved it.  After the movie you go into the atrium.  It was pretty awesome, and that's coming from someone who is afraid of every insect, including lady bugs!  If you do not like things flying at your face and landing on you, this is probably not your thing.  They will land on you, especially if you are wearing bright or neon colors!  There is plenty of room to walk around and also some benches throughout for sitting.  They also have an area where you can check out insects, bees and sting rays, which was neat.  All in all we had a great time.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because it is a little expensive, $19 for an adult, $10 for a child, which I think is steep."}
{"text":"I went to Butterfly Wonderland opening weekend, and had a fabulous time. It was nice to be educated about these amazing creatures, and be able to see them flying everywhere in the observatory room. I thoroughly enjoyed the 3D movie, and entire experience. This is a great place to take children, and a fun date idea!"}
{"text":"First of all, I have to say I'm very glad to see an attraction like this in Scottsdale & we will definitely go again.  I do agree with many other reviewers that the $20 price tag for adults is a little steep.  For a family of four you're looking at around $70.00 for a visit.  However, they do sell a Family Annual Pass for a little over $120 bucks, so that is definitely the better way to go if you plan on going more than once.  I have 2 kids, a 4 year old, and a 7 year old.  The 7 year old loved it, as she adores anything nature related & is fascinated by animals, insects, fish, etc.  The 4 year old....not so much.  He did not like the butterflies literally everywhere inside the atrium & was frightened by them constantly flying near his face & around him. It seemed the children we saw either really,really loved it or didn't at all & were scared of the butterflies. I admit, as an adult it does take some getting used to all of  butterflies constantly swirling around you at any given time, but once you do it's awesome.  My 7 year old couldn't wait to get a picture with butterflies on her, and we did!  The fish tanks, ray petting area, bee & ant exhibits can be done in about 10-15 minutes, so aren't really much to write home about.  The 3D movie is highly recommended & is very fascinating & beautiful to watch.  Both of my children really enjoyed it & had no problem sitting still through the 15 minute length.   Overall, we enjoyed the educational & unique nature of this attraction. You will have to decide for yourself if you and your children would enjoy this, and whether or not they will be scared by lots of things flying around them."}
{"text":"Entering into a world filled with wonder and a myriad of pupa, chrysalis, and cocoons sets the stage for the visitor who walks through the doors of Butterfly Wonderland. Each exhibit engaged young and old alike, beckoning them to stroll through the growing foliage of their indoor arboretum.   Fluttering about are various species of the lovely winged creature-the butterfly. Some are petite while others have a wing span of about 4-6 inches. All butterflies flutter in a whimsical motion to the sounds of soothing, instrumental music playing on the loud speaker.   Humidity mimics the temperatures of a true rain forest experience-laughter ensues from visitors as butterflies surround them, even stopping for a photo opportunity on the finger of a young girl or shoulder of the most rugged gent.  Proceed with caution as smiles will break out everywhere amongst this charming, Valley habitat."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I could spend all day inside the butterfly room if it wasn't so humid. Butterflies are everywhere and will land on you so you can get some awesome pictures. It was nice to just forget about life and look at all the pretty species of butterflies. I'd definitely go back!   I would recommend wearing light clothing because you will get very sweaty because of the humidity."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Butterfly Wonderland. First you watch a fourteen minute video about butterflies which was very interesting, I learned a few things. Then you're released to the exhibits, they had different bugs and a mini aquarium. They also had an area you could touch the sting rays, which I though was pretty cool. The butterfly area was very humid!! I enjoyed seeing all the different colors and types of butterflies.  It's a little pricey. If you have an AAA card use it!! =) Have fun! Also a cute place to go on a date. It's pretty small we were done in about 45 minutes."}
{"text":"My in-laws are here for the weekend and we spent a lovely morning at the Butterfly Wonderland in Scottsdale.  Definitely an attraction for all ages.  When you enter there is a 3-D movie (about 15 minutes long) about the monarch butterfly.  Interesting and entertaining.  The conservatory is small and there were many people there but it is exciting to see all of the butterflies and get to interact with them up-close."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful 2 hours. We were pretty thirsty afterwards - Sorry, $2.50 for a small drink is a little to much. But the 3D movie great"}
{"text":"The butterfly portion was okay. The reptiles and small aquarium was so so. I found the staff to be rude especially in the cafe. My kids were starving so I paid the ridiculous price for a small pizza and it was mostly burned. I let them know and the worker didn't say anything when I let her know- just turned around and walked off. A simply acknowledgment of this issue would have sufficed. We won't be coming back nor recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning! My kids loved it! The only downside was the drive to get there but overall a great experience"}
{"text":"Admission was a rip at $20 a person- we spent over $150 for our family to go into a large greenhouse and see some butterflies. Not really $150 well spent. If the cost was half that, I'd say go, but you don't get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Pros:   1. great atrium with thousands of colorful, fluttering butterflies. Different areas. Would be nice if the topography had slightly more variety. Soothing in almost a zen way.  2. Staff here were great - making sure one didn't leave with an errant butterfly on one's back.   3. Besides Butterfly Atrium (far and away the highlight), there are also interesting areas with many well-designed aquariums, a cutaway view of a live beehive, and some manta rays.   Cons:   1. As soon as one enters, a staff member snaps your photo. Later, one can buy copies of this flash photo in various sizes, in a frame, or not. But no mention when photo is taken that it is not for free. Or its purpose. And one is not given a choice. One is just told, \"Stand over here for your photo.\" One feels hoodwinked and then pressured to buy a copy of the photo later. They take one shot - so if someone in your party looks goofy - too bad. This absolutely should not be one's first impression and experience upon entering.  2. Tickets are pricey, but each member of my party received a $5 discount. Great. But nothing about it on their website. Hard to find ticket price info on their website. If we had known about the discount, we would have come sooner. Was the discount because it was summer? The day of the week we attended? The time? There is no clue on their website.  Nothing about a forced photo (that one is pressed to pay for later) on their website as part of the Wonderland experience.  3. Their website is terrible in terms of useful information being easy to find."}
{"text":"Comes down to \"bang for your buck\".  If this was $10-!5 an adult and half for child, I would say it is about an hours worth of enjoyment.  But at the price they are charging,, look elsewhere.  The zoo give you hours of enjoyment.  This is a one and too-soon done and never again."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place but too pricey.. the kids liked it but not sure it's worth the money.$75 for our family and we were there maybe an hour. Spend a little more and go to the zoo or the safari park. At least you will be there a couple hours."}
{"text":"I am so enamored with this place I am a lifetime member. I live nowhere near it and somehow find myself there every couple of months. The movie is cute and the pupa station interesting, but I breeze by. Because I need pure butterflies."}
{"text":"Very beautiful and educational but priced to high for the average Joe to bring his whole family. It's also too bad that we can't afford to bring the grandkids, a little over 88 dollars to walk in the doors is too steep for us."}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring your kids. Beyond being just a fun day out, I think one can learn quite a lot about the lifecycle of butterflies and moths. Watching them hatch right in front of your eyes is quite interesting. This is followed by a stroll amongst these beautiful insects inside a giant glass lined atrium. With the humidity kicked up, it's a micro tropical rainforest with small waterfalls and a Koi pond.  I would point out that they can do kid's birthday parties. My daughter did her 10th birthday there and had a great time with all her friends."}
{"text":"I like this place very much. It's a bit pricy for not really having much else to do while being there. I am excited for the Odysea to be completed. Overall it's a lovely escape from the usual outings, peacefully  calm like being in a rainforest. I hope they have plans for the future to make the area for the butterflies even larger because it can get pretty cramped with people."}
{"text":"My family and I had an exceptional time here. We went to the butterfly area where butterflies landed on my children. Great photo opportunity.  There were thousands of butterflies.  They have a laser and mirror maze area. These were awesome for my family.  Really neat.  Last we went to the ocean world. The 3-D movie was great. The ocean carousel was surprisingly unique and a must see.  Fish tanks were OK.  The have other pay-to-play experiences such as penguin feeding etc. I recommend the basics."}
{"text":"An interesting place for kids and adults alike! There is a fun, 3-D movie discussing the life of monarch butterflies and a \"nursery\" to watch butterflies hatch out of their cocoons. My only piece of advice is for the ladies: Don't bother straightening your hair that day- the butterfly exhibit is very humid!  Beautiful butterflies of so many varieties make it well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I had read the reviews before going. Felt a little weary due to the fact that I have a 1 1/2year old who doesnt like to stay still for more than 2mins but it wasnt that bad. The movie was entertaining even for my toddler. I had an idea from the reviews about the size of this place but holy cow its small. We were done within 20 minutes at the most. It was beautiful but yea pretty small. So thats why I rated it 3 stars; too overpriced for a 20 minute walk. We paid about $56 for 1 adult, 1 military, and 1 child ticket (I have another child, my toddler didnt have to pay). Oh and we didnt get to pet any stingrays, they added sharks so they didnt allow anybody to touch which is understandable but such a bummer. Probably wont return but it was nice to see as a one time thing."}
{"text":"This place was okay but nothing to write home about. We didn't have a bad experience but it didn't wow us either. It was a bit  pricey for something that only takes 2 hours. My son was three years old so perhaps he was too young, but we probably won't go back until he is much older."}
{"text":"I went for a school field trip and thought it was going to be super boring!! Boy was I wrong I went with a second grade buddy and we actually had a good time. The movie was interesting and informative. Then we saw the emergence center and it was amazing me a thirteen year old boy was actually interested in watching a butterfly hatch. Then I thought that was amazing until i saw the observatory full of butterflies and some landed on me and my buddy. Then we went to the aquarium which I felt was a little boring compared to sea world or anything like that but was nice. Overall a nice experience"}
{"text":"This place is fantstic!  It takes your breath away.  Such a fun place to take the kids and watch their amazement."}
{"text":"Expensive, but delightful exhibit, took the 4 grandkids and was considering buying an annual grandparent pass, but will not return. About half the staff was pleasant, the rest were just plain rude.  After witnessing more than a few unpleasant staff interactions with other people, I finally decided to call it a day for us when we walked into the room with the interactive manta ray display, and witnessed the employee there barking at the people trying to see the manta rays. This employee intimidated the crowd to the degree that everybody gave up trying to participate and left the room. We didn't even want to approach the display. It's a shame because although it's expensive, the 3D movie was informative and fun, the butterflies were magical, and all the facility is really nice and has an upscale feel to it. The place is off the beaten path, so I am assuming the poor quality of staff is the result of not having a large potential employee pool to choose from. We will see if things improve in the future, but as it stands, I will not go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. A must see place. I definitely recommend it to all the visitors who come to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place but over priced. They have an informative and fun 3D movie followed by an emerging room. There we watched butterflies emerging from their cocoons. It was fascinating. There were many different species and we watched several breaking out of their cocoons and start drying their wings. That was followed by an interactive experience with real and very beautiful butterflies. The rest of the facility was fair with a couple spiders, an ant display and bee display. The touch tank with a few live stingrays was disappointing because it was so controlled. The employee kept yelling at everyone to have only 2 fingers up to your knuckle in the pool. This made it virtually impossible to even touch a stingray.  It was nice to go to but too pricey. My middle to teenage children enjoyed the facility too but once was enough. We probably wouldn't return for a year or two."}
{"text":"The 3D movie is great  and the butterflies are  amazing! this is a great place to bring out of town guessts or a great place to go if you an hour or 2 of extra time.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is great for kids, particularly my two crazy kids who are in awe and wonder with the thousand of butterflies that are here. For adults, it's good too, but not as great as for the kids."}
{"text":"I fully agree with the positive reviews already posted about Butterfly Wonderland.  It's a well-designed and well-executed display of the life cycle and habitats of butterflies, and the atrium was very enjoyable (although it would probably be more tranquil mid-week during the school year).  I've been to a few other, similar facilities in the US and overseas, and I believe it's on a par with any of them.  My only complaint?  It's overpriced at $18.95 per adult and even at $16.95 for discounted admission (senior, military, AAA)."}
{"text":"Our Girl Scout troop spent the afternoon here today and we had a blast.  We were able today find discount coupons, so we paid for an adult and child entered free.  If you can find coupons, that's the way to go, because frankly prices are a bit high.  Once in, you go to a 3D movie about the Monarch Butterflies which was amazing.  Lasts about 15 minutes.  I thought I read on another review that the capacity for this theater is about 25, which is incorrect.  The theater holds about 150 or so.  Thought that would be helpful to know that if you plan on coming with a large group, like we did.   Then onto the atrium.  You go to a small room beforehand where someone goes over the rules.  No running, horsing around because you could accidentally kill a butterfly. You must stay on the walk path (no strollers allowed here).  No touching or swatting at the butterflies, and lastly, no picking the plants or flowers.  The atrium is a bit humid and warm, but today was about 85-90 degrees out and it was fine.  Butterflies are everywhere, sometimes landing on you or on the walkway so watch your step!  My daughter was immediately greeted by a large butterfly on her head and me on my arm and back.  they are so beautiful.  we were there about an hour and a half.  it was really awesome. I would definitely go again if I could find discount tickets again.  The kids are on spring break, but even so, on a Friday afternoon, it wasn't overly crowded and parking wasn't an issue at all. The gift shop and cafe are like any other at other amusement parks.  Nothing super special and pricey.    Overall we all really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"We (3 adults) loved our experience at Butterfly Wonderland. It's worth the $20 entry fee, here's why: 1) gave us a break from the AZ heat 2) watched a 3-D movie with great facts about butterflies 3) The Conservatory-so many species of butterflies  and many opportunities for picture-taking. It is a warm and moist environment and there are benches to sit on to rest. 4) the stingrays in the Amazon Aquatic Display are AWESOME. You get to interact with the rays. 5) the staff are friendly and patient."}
{"text":"A great place for kids to learn about the migratory patterns of butterflies and their various life stages.  Its a little pricey, but worth it. If you live nearby I would strongly consider the $125 annual membership for two adults, and two children.  Here's a little tip: the longer you hang out in the atrium/greenhouse the more sweaty you become from the humidity  The more you sweat, the more the butterflies will land on you to drink your sweat (I know, gross lol)  Also a great place to bring a date."}
{"text":"We went as a family today. We were greeted by kind employees who were extremely knowledgeable and we were thankful. Clearly we had no idea how much it cost to ship butterflies there monthly since they die within two weeks and the moths in four days!  Having to constantly pump water to hydrate the beautiful foliage and flowers isn't cheap.  For those who think it is expensive - well educate yourselves as to how much it cost to run that facility!  My truth after educating myself - CHEAP for how our lives were enriched today!!!  :)  We were blessed by the beauty there. Their 14 miniature three-d movie was awesome!  We highly recommend this sanctuary!  :)"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for my birthday and it was a blast!! A very fun and informative way to learn and study our fragile winged friends. As another reviewer said this place is more geared for a \"mature\" audience because the few little kids that were there with us were all horribly fussy and disruptive.  The monarch film was interesting and I finally got my wish to see an atlas moth in person!!(one hatched while I was there). But you definitely get your money's worth in the terrarium. Over 3000 butterflies of many species flutter about indiscriminate in their little paradise.  To anyone reading I ask that you be gentle with them, their lives are short and frail. So no touchy! Otherwise enjoy the beauty of Mother Nature!"}
{"text":"We visited while we were in town on vacation, and we LOVED it! It was much better than we thought and a very unique experience. It is a little pricey ($20/person), but will give the whole family and experience they will never forget.   The atrium it self is very large and house way more.butterflies than we were expecting. There are butterflies everywhere. We all had several butterflies land on us (which made for great pictures).  The movie before hand was informative and entertaining. The small attractions, including live stingray petting were also nice additions. Well worth it to visit at least once."}
{"text":"We brought our family to this place to have a good time. We were having a great time enjoying the butterflies ,and just taking pictures we weren't touching them or anything and the lady with the short hair that was working there scolded us that they can't touch our skin...not instructing us ...scolded us like we were children then we started walking around again and she followed us which is odd..and continued to talk rudely to us and we weren't doing anything but taking pictures. We literally felt harassed. Management needs to teach there employees to treat customers kindly. I won't be coming back to this place !!!"}
{"text":"We must have picked the best day ever to come visit, small crowd. The 3 D movie fascinated us all, it was beautifully done. The \"nursery\" was very well done, they have a huge variety of butterflies compared to some others we have seen. The pavilion itself was gorgeous, so many beautiful , active butterflies. The rainforest atmosphere was done perfectly. I had several hitchhikers, so much fun. My grandkids, ages 7 and 2/12 were entertained by all the different colors of butterflies for a good while. It was 107 outside but was very comfortable in the pavilion.  One of my very favorite exhibits was an active bee colony that had access from the outside. Whoever designed this display is a genius.  We did not spend much time in the small aquarium section as it didn't quite fit with the whole theme. I understand they are promoting the new Odysea aquarium slated to open next year, that is why the exhibit is there. So, as to all the negatives on pricing, a place like this cost a fortune to build. They are not going to make it on a 5 or 10.00 admission fee. It is totally worth the money if you appreciate and want to learn about butterflies and their role in nature. I want my grandchildren to grow up appreciating animals, butterflies, and anything in nature more than video games."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my experience here. Despite the admission ($19 for adults) I came out appreciating butterflies.  They have you watch a 3D film about the life cycle, and then you get to see parts of the life cycle live-- like an exhibit of TONS chrysalis in a glass case, growing and the butterfly emerging. I know this sounds super cheesy as I write this but it's fascinating!  Also, though it took a solid half hour, I did allow a butterfly to sit on my hand. You literally go into a greenhouse of them and they are everywhere. It's uncomfortable at first for the fidgety like me.  If someone were visiting from out of town, I'd take them here (but offer to pay for their admission)."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I always suggest it anytime a friend asks what we should do. It's just so peaceful and relaxing. They have it structured very well. Its fun to watch the movie about the butterflies to learn more about them and then see them actually becoming butterflies next door. Kids and adults love it just alike. I went there a few weeks ago and was worried as it was summer but it was just the right temperature."}
{"text":"I'm giving 1 star for the extreme pricing. The facility is so small, not a lot going on, and they simply charge an arm and a leg. For 2 adults and a kid to do the maze and the wonderland it was over $80. We dragged it out for 2 hours, max. It's neat, the butterflies landing on you. And they are beautiful. But it's way too much money. And this year they break ground on an aquarium - I can't imagine what that will add to the price. For reference, I can spend the whole day at Makutu's Island for $10, and believe me, my 6 year old has way more fun there than a 10 minute walk with the butterflies that we drug out into an hour. If you've seen one butterfly you've seen them all. Save your money. It's just not even close to worth it."}
{"text":"The Butterfly Wonderland is SUCH a cute idea. I can't believe someone hadn't already thought of it and opened it. You go in and there is a cute small museum for butterflies and a gift shop, this is followed by a 3D education movie (great for children) on the Monarch and then you go into the \"butterfly wonderland\" where you walk along   a little path where the butterflies flutter all around you and land on you. You can take pictures and it is def. great for kids. Overall, it is such an adorable place.   However, I gave it four stars because the prices are high for what it is. This may be because it is new and eventually they will come down. Adults are around $18 dollars each while kids are about 1/2 of that."}
{"text":"What a great place!  My wife and I took my mom here when she visited for the holidays, and we had a really enjoyable time.  The short 3D movie was really well done, and when we finished with that, it was really neat seeing all of the new butterflys 'hatching' out of their chrysallis in the next room.  And when we got to the Butterfly pavillion...well heck, who doesn't like it when all the butterflys float all around you and occasionally land on your shirt? Great!"}
{"text":"We bought the lifetime family passes.  Kinda wish we hadn't - given the limited experiences of the Butterfly Wonderland, but I'm sure it'll improve over time.  The short movie, ants & bees, and aquariums are all afterthoughts.    The real attraction is the butterfly habitat.  We took our two kids (2 and 4) and they did not want to leave.  If you're a photographer or a nature person - it's the place for you.  For anyone else - avoid the life-time pass... until you go at least once.  Got a family of 4... go by yourself first to see what that price of admission really get you."}
{"text":"This gets three tentative stars.   It's advertised to be the largest indoor butterfly atrium in \"the Americas\" and I suppose that is true. But the experience overall was extremely underwhelming and I will tell you why.  First, the good. The Butterfly Exhibit in Boston is much smaller than this place. It's actually more like a closet than anything. So the good news is that Scottsdale's exhibit beats Boston's by several factors.  Now, the bad. I went to the Butterfly Exhibit in Xcaret last year and it was FOUR times bigger than Scottsdale's. Butterfly Wonderland measures ten thousand square feet...Xcaret is forty-thousand and is two full levels.   Now back to Butterfly Wonderland: After paying the fee ($$$!) you go down a hallway showing meager butterfly art. Then you're led into the theater, where you see a brief 3-D movie on Monarch Butterflies. Nice movie. It's definitely geared for kids, so it's very streamlined and the language of the movie is oh-so-easy to understand...but the sheer simplicity of the movie means that lots of information gets weeded out. I am an information geek. Cram my cranium with it! I can take it. Even as a child, I could. All that information would entice me to buy books, research, maybe even plant my own butterfly garden so that I can be a part of the action...  So all too soon, the movie ends. And you are led to the Butterfly Atrium. The atrium itself is very nice, and it should be, since it is brand new. Thousands of butterflies abound! In the air, clustered around flowers, gathering upon each other to get at bowls heaped with cut fruit.   Ten thousand feet is ten thousand feet...and all too soon you walk in your little semi-circle and it's over. I walked slowly, took many pictures and some videos, and was still in and out of the \"largest atrium of the Americas\" in less than 12 minutes.  After leaving the atrium was a tinny ant exhibit, bee exhibit, scorpion exhibit, and then some aquariums filled with fish you can see at the pet store. The lighting was pretty bad. Many signs were permanently hidden in shadows, making them very difficult to impossible to read. As for the fish and other creatures, the tags just showed their names but no other information. Where do they live? Why are they featured? What do they eat? Are they endangered? These are questions that children and adults ask.  So, the next stop was a stingray tank, which you can step up to. Being able to touch these magnificent animals is definitely a highlight. However. At the Wildlife World Zoo, you can purchase some food for a buck or two and actually FEED these graceful creatures.   Then there is the obligatory gift shop...for kids. Not too many items that would interest an adult. And remember, I'm just a big kid at heart...so I know that the chinsy toys offered just didn't cut it for me as a child as well.   The effort that went into this place is tremendous. But it's very small and you can seriously be done with the whole thing in less time than it took to drive here. I know and understand that they have to cater to the mentality of children, but that does not mean you have to dumb yourself down. Challenge children to think! Challenge their geography! Challenge their vocabulary! Teach them to read and write cursive! But I digress.  This is certainly worth a look. And a look is all you will get. You'll get some very nice pics from the Atrium. Other than that, I recommend the Wildlife World Zoo."}
{"text":"Have taken out of town visitors here on several occasions - really unique place if your looking for something different to do.  My visitors have always remarked about how fun and interesting it was.    It's also nice if you don't want to do a bunch of walking and there are plenty of places to sit down once inside the greenhouse area.  Make sure and wear bright red or orange clothing - the butterfly's will land all over you!"}
{"text":"I love coming here to photograph the butterflies and flowers. I only gave it 4 stars because the Waking Up With Butterflies event is not very organized. The first time I went (4/30), the older woman running the check-ins at the front desk was not organized. When it was my turn to check in, she invited the guy behind me to do so first because he was a member. Ok, not that big of a deal.  But I came again on 5/21, and invited my mom this time because she enjoys the photography as well. We were waiting in line for quite some time. When it was the girl's turn in front of us, the older woman called up a mom, dad and their son to check in before her! They weren't even in line! They paid with BOTH cash and a credit card, so it took forever. I could tell the girl in front of us was not happy. She gets checked in, so it's our turn. But the older woman decides to let the 3 ladies behind us go instead because they were members! It was extremely rude. My mom and I were getting very impatient with this. Then as we were trying to pay, one of those 3 ladies had a fit because her name was spelled wrong on her tag. Who cares?! It's not like anyone is going to care. So that made us more mad. We FINALLY paid and checked in after about 15 minutes total. After that, we did enjoy our photography in the atrium, but we will not be doing this event again. It's not worth the trouble of letting people cut in line just because they're members. Maybe have 2 lines, one for members and one for non-members, and 2 people checking those lines in. It will move faster and no one will be mad. OR! Just go through the line and everyone can wait their turn like it should be,"}
{"text":"Being a nature lover, I always try to visit aquariums, botanical gardens, etc. when I travel, so I was very excited to learn of this new place in the city I live. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. While the butterfly atrium by itself was pretty nice, it is not the \"largest\" space of butterflies in North America. The butterfly exhibit within the already HUGE Xcaret park in Mexico is about 4 times larger and set within a netted area of the rain forest with waterfalls and tropical plants. Also, the emergence \"gallery\" was paltry compared to Xcaret's extensive ROOMS of emerging butterflies in all the different stages of development along with the interesting stages of plants used.   The conservatory has just one circular path that takes about 15 minutes. And after the 15 minute film on Monarch butterflies, I can't justify the steep $20 entrance fee. Ant colony? This was basically just several of the kits that they sell in the gift shop opened and displayed under a glass case. Honey Bee extravaganza? That's a bit of an overstatement. Good luck finding any queens as the lighting is so poor, most of the panels are in darkness. And the \"Rivers of the Amazon\"? These are just large aquariums of exactly the same fish that you can buy at Petsmart, at which I would rather go to for free. The sting ray pool was a let down too, as even at the World Wildlife Zoo, they have a pool with a ton of sting rays that you can even feed. Here, there are just a few babies that good luck if you get to touch one that may venture to go near your fingers (you are only allowed to put your hand in up to your knuckles).  The cafe looked like an afterthought with one of those cheap Target-like menu boards serving about the same level of food: think hot dogs, chips, etc. Whoever designed this place has made some very poor decisions. How about lower the entrance fee, but have a more inviting sit-down cafe with table service and excellent food? Instead, you have this empty cafeteria-like place with tons of bored employees just standing around.  Basically, I was in and out within an hour and left feeling cheated. Even the gift shop was a total letdown. Where are the magnets? Hello! Wind chimes with butterflies? Nope. Move on."}
{"text":"Well worth it. I highly recommend this to anyone who does not bring a screaming child. The butterflies do not take well to the wailing. Sorry."}
{"text":"I've been twice since it opened. I took a 6. And 9 year old. They loved it! The 3D movie is excellent. I would recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Fun but fairly small.  It only took us maybe 2 hours to go through the entire place and at these prices its really not worth it.  The movie was great but you see a lot of it during the preview online on their website.  The chrysalis area was really cool but you have to wait awhile to see anything since everyone gets dumped into that room after the movie.  The bee and ant exhibits are almost non-existant.  The stingray area was also not very good.  The staff person there did not interact with anyone and when you asked a question, he had no idea about the rays."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! What a neat experience. So many beautiful butterflies! I've never seen anything like it. Highly recommend it! Whether you have kids or not, you should go!"}
{"text":"What a treasure!  This place is a true gem. The butterfly area was incredible. My husband picked up a companion right off the bat and it held on until the employee brushed it off.  Petting a stingray was fun too :)  Understand this is not inexpensive, but you have to understand the cost of maintaining such a gem."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant about our trip to butterfly wonderland. Personally, I didn't feel like I could justify spending $20 to spend 10 minutes looking at butterflies. I was wrong because it was definitely worth the money. Butterfly wonderland is a place where you could spend hours without even realizing it. When you first get there you have to watch a tiny \"documentary\" about the life cycle of the monarch butterfly. I read a lot of negative reviews about this part, but I happened to find it very interesting. Then you go into a little room where they have on display the incoming butterflies that are getting ready to leave their little cocoons. Again, very interesting. The most wonderful part though is when you actually enter the wonderland, and I do not use that word lightly. It honestly feels like a magical wonderland. Like I said previously, I was worried about getting there and only spending a few minutes looking around and then leaving, but we were there for a couple hours without even realizing it. The greenery is beautiful, and the butterflies are breath taking. I will most definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Sunday around 4:00 pm. It had a few families and couples but it wasn't crowded. The whole experience was worth it if you've never seen this sort of exhibit, which I never had. However, as others have said, the price point ($18 per person with student discount) is deterring me from making another visit. But it makes for a fun date or a cool place to take an out-of-towner!   I already loved butterflies but this place has made me love and appreciate them even more. I would recommend at least a one time visit!"}
{"text":"AMAZING place!! Staff is super friendly and the butterfly garden is a breath taking experience! It is pretty humid in there though, so don't bring a jacket unless you want to carry it around. There is also a variety of butterfly workshops! I personally enjoy the Butterfly Yoga."}
{"text":"This was such an amazing experience. Way better than I thought. The butterflies are magical! And the insects and reptile viewing was so cool. We all loved the 3D movie also. I would definitely recommend this to all ages. It's really cool. Oh and if you've never seen an Atlas Moth, they have 3 of them. The largest moth in the world."}
{"text":"Finally went to check this place out since its been opened. I have always been hesitant going due to the admission and unfortunatly I felt the same leaving, I feel that 18.95 for an adult is way to expensive for what all is there.  I have a 2 yr old son that liked it ( but wasnt over excited like he is at the zoo) but im glad he was free! Other then the green house there is not much there. When I heard about the ant farm and the Bee's I was thinking something awesome and was totally let down when I saw it. the Ant farm was the size of an average aquarium you have at home and the bee's were even worst there ware 3 windows with only 1 where the bees were. The sting rays and the 6-7 aquariums they have there are small (all fresh water) The only good thing about this place is the green house, basically paying 20 bucks to watch butterflies fly around.   The only reason I'm giving this place a 3 rating is because the faciliy is kept very clean and the staff is nice. I could wrap my head around a 12.00 admission but 18+ tax is just crazy.  I LOVE butterflies and wished this place was much bigger. I hope they add onto this place once this whole odysey complex is developed more. I wish I could be so excited about this place but was let down, SORRY."}
{"text":"Butterfly Wonderland made our weekend. I love, love, love this place. There's a butterfly theater where you learn about the lives of butterflies via 3D, there's a very cute gift shop, a cacoon gallery where you can see butterflies taking form and of course; the habitat.  I've been reading some of the other reviews. Yes of course the habitat is hot and humid, these specific breeds of butterflies are found in the rainforest; other conditions would kill them. Still, I'm positive that even people who aren't either A) cold all the time or B) butterfly enthusiasts will love it. I'm actually warm all the time and I fell in love with the place. Butterflies float right by you, sometimes land on your clothes and flutter in bowls of fruit, flowers and on plants. They are beautiful. It's really calming and amazing to see them so close-up.   Two helpful hints for the habitat: A) you aren't supposed to touch the butterflies with your hands, it's not good for them and B) look at the ground when you're walking, some of the butterflies relax down there.  There's also a small aquarium area with fish and you can pet a stingray. You can see bees in their natural habitat, ants and scorpions also. It would be cool if they had a ladybug exhibit too!  Of course, I bought the limited-time-offer lifetime membership, $100 for lifetime access. I know we'll be back many (many) times. I absolutely recommend this place for a date/family outing/engagement proposal/some-much-need alone time... basically anyone should be able to manage an excuse to go here."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience.  The 3d movie at the beginning really sets the stage for going in.  Once in the variety of butterflies was amazing.  Wear bright colors if you want them to land on you.  Great photo opportunities.  There is a small cafeteria if you want to take a break and go back in."}
{"text":"On vacation here from la we had to check this out. It was absolutely worth the money. Bought a combo ticket to the new aquarium next door and had a great day visiting both. Visited on a weekday which made it less crowded. Good displays at both sites."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience for all ages.  So many butterflies to look at and take pictures.  If you move slowly they will land and go for a ride."}
{"text":"Had a few hours to kill in the Scottsdale area, and was looking for something to do that wasn't associated with golf, food, or shopping. We decided to check out the Butterfly Wonderland based on all the great reviews, and we were very happy we did.   The center is a great tour and educational experience related to butterflies and their migration (the Monarch in particular), and the main conservatory attraction was great fun. Great opportunity to see and interact with so many different butterfly varieties. With all the colors, patterns, and textures, it is a photographer's dream. The kids were all thrilled to be there as well, especially when they were lucky enough to have a butterfly land on them.  Overall a great way to spend a couple of hours and see something unique. I look forward to taking my daughter back when she is old enough to really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Went here for a school field trip with my sons class. They seemed very disorganized and not ready for 5 classes to show up, it took an hour from when we arrived until our group (there were only 2) to get in. We then had to have the kids sit and wait on the floor before going into the 3D short movie. The movie was informative and the kids all enjoyed it. Then we moved to another room where they displayed the crysallides (sp?) and briefed us on the rules for the butterfly garden. The garden was great and the butterflies were attracted to those that wore super fluorescent shirts. A very old man (wearing a Veterans hat) accidentally stepped backward onto a butterfly on the ground crushing it and the employees response was very short and rude. We were then rushed through the indoor area that has spiders and sharks, barely saw any of it but didn't look too amazing, and then our group left. Overall the kids had a great time but as a parent I wouldn't pay for that experience."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came to visit here from California. To be honest, I was expecting more for my money. The experience of having butterflies fly around me and the kids was great. The kids weren't really thrilled with anything, but that. The staffs are friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"LOVED THIS PLACE!! Great for kids and adults to go and check out. My little toddler loved it and my sister loved the sting ray :D so yes it is quite beautiful and the price is great...I cant remember exactly what I paid. But I do remember thinking wow that's not bad for 3 adults and a toddler."}
{"text":"We had a great time here.  Everyone was incredibly friendly.  The butterflies were amazing.  So many of them and so many varieties.  Made me wish I had a better camera!  The Native American guy doing the stingray petting pool was hilarious as well.    The mirror maze next door is no joke either.  So used to ones at carnivals which aren't ever good, but this one throws you for a loop!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my toddlers. The place is beautiful and the butterflies are gorgeous. However it is ridiculously expensive. We are happy to pay more for value, however until they add more features and exhibits, I don't know why they don't lower the price because they are going to lose people in the long run. If you do you love butterflies, it is a great place though. Depends if it's worth it to you"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the atrium with the butterflies flying about freely.  And, sometimes they would just sit there so you could look at them up close and land on you especially if you were wearing white.  They are very beautiful. The 3D movie is very informative and illustrates the stages of the butterfly and length of life.   However, it also seems like a strange combination of other exhibits which are small and not particularly informative.  Their website talks about the ants and bees which sounds interesting but there is little to see. I have to give it three stars because at $19.00 for an adult ticket I think it is a bit pricy experience."}
{"text":"Amazing! Highly recommend. Knowledgeable staff & amazing large building houses butterflies. There is also section at end insects. Interesting too. The next day I went to aquarium, which was also first rate."}
{"text":"Expensive, but worth going at least once. It is $20 for adults and $12 or $13 for kids over 2. The snack bar prices are outrageous... $3 for a bottle of water, $5 for a rice krispie treat... but it is all worth it when you step into the butterfly sanctuary. The butterflies are literally everywhere, probably thousands of them in there. They are not shy. One landed on my 3 year Olds arm and stayed there while we walked through the whole exhibit. Very cool experience."}
{"text":"MAGIC!  But I am getting ahead of myself.  I bookmarked prior to a trip to the \"The Grand Canyon State.\"  It seems like an interesting place to visit if the opportunity presented it's self.  Sure enough it did.    We had some time to kill after taking in some Padre BP.  We like butterflies and this seemed like a nice place to kill some time.  Coordinates put into the iPhone and the route was easily negotiated.    Damn!  The parking lot was not full but it was busy.  The ticket line was full and busy.  I quickly reconsidered the idea of making a visit but the draw of Lepidoptera was too great.  The GF and I settled in and I could not wait to experience and educate myself.  The beginning of the journey consists of a 3D movie about the multigenerational journey of a Monarch butterfly family.  The theater is large and the 3D is awesome!  I learned a lot and I was happy to hear the Monarch epicenter is now a World Heritage Site.  After the movie, you are brought into a briefing area where you are told about the do's and do not's of entering the wonderland.  While waiting to enter you can inform yourself about various stages of butterfly development from Pupa to Adult.  When your time arrives to enter, you are instantly transported into the butterfly equivalent of Wonka Land.  There beautiful creatures are flying about in an amazing biosphere.  Humid and warm but not unbearable.  You can loiter about for as long as you like.  Don't touch!  Various breeds will zoom and do all things adult butterfly related as you meander about.  Sure there were lot's of people but everyone seemed seemed respectful.  The overall beauty and tranquility of these beautiful creatures was....dare, I say.......therapeutic.   Remember to WATCH YOUR STEP.  If you want some extra attention...WEAR BRIGHT COLORS!!"}
{"text":"Complete waste of time. They force you to watch a 3D movie about butterflies and then wait even longer after that before you are allowed to see the butterflies."}
{"text":"This was a very nice place took my grandkids yesterday March 29, 2017 very educational, butterflies will land on you. We were there for 2 hours but an hour to an hour and half is plenty of time here, I would recommend it at least once"}
{"text":"What an incredible place! If you love butterflies, nature and serenity, the Butterfly Wonderland is the place to be! With over 3,000 butterflies, a small reptile and fish museum, a theater and a gift shop and food court, Butterfly Wonderland is a terrific place to learn about and see up close this amazing species of insect.  When you first walk in, you are given the opportunity to watch a 10 minute film or continue straight to the butterfly exhibit. I recommend watching the film to gain a greater appreciation for butterflies and the obstacles they must overcome to survive and continue their species. I certainly learned a lot! For instance, did you know they only eat milkweed?  From there, it's off to the main event - the giant greenhouse that houses a variety of plants and 3,000 butterflies! It really is a fantastic place. There are literally butterflies all around, and many will land on you as you walk around (be careful where you step by the way). As they say in the museum though, \"the butterfly chooses you\", so you won't want to touch any or pick them up.  After the greenhouse, there's a small section indoors to take a look at some reptiles and fish. It's not the equivalent of a larger zoo, but there are still many animals to see and learn about.  The food court and gift shop here are standard (decent and pricey), but I certainly recommend at least checking out the gift shop on the way out.  Overall, I loved this unique experience and would certainly venture back on a future trip!"}
{"text":"Way way overpriced for what you get.  No need to plan for more than a couple hours.  Seeing the Butterfly's is nice but the place is way small.  The 3d movie is interesting and informative. Be sure you come on a sunny day. Whatever you do,  don't miss the outdoor atrium/conservatory area. We almost missed it which would have deemed the trip a total waste."}
{"text":"the 3d movie was excellent,   atrium and has a lot of butterflies for the kids to look at and interact with."}
{"text":"Meh... There were things I liked, and things I didn't. I probably wouldn't go back anytime soon, but my 7 year old said he would (of course he didn't pay the admission fee to get in either).  *The 3D movie was interesting. Some small children were \"ewwww\"-ing through it. Their parents took them out of the theater. (I think it was the part where the caterpillar emerges from its egg and eats the egg shell.) *After the movie, you are herded into the chrysalis room, where there are 3 viewing windows full of butterfly chrysalises; some were hatching as we stood there. Unfortunately, people were crowding to see and had no patience to wait their turn. *The butterfly enclosure was neat. However, there was not a wide variety of butterflies flitting around. This is where we spent the most time.  Not sure if you are allowed to touch and pick up the butterflies!?! (At the Desert Botanical Gardens, they have a yearly spring butterfly exhibit, and you are not allowed to touch the butterflies; they can land on you, but you cannot pick them up or handle them.) Some parents were allowing their children to do so. There were no signs or volunteers in the room while we were there. *The ant/bee room had no volunteers or signage either.  My son asked what the medium was that the ants lived in. Again there was no one to ask or explain anything. *The aquarium was another disappointment. There are a few aquariums with random fish swimming around. Again, no signs.  There was a volunteer, but she was sitting in a chair stamping the kids sheets as they entered.  When we came into the aquarium, she informed us the \"sting rays were being shy.\"  The 3 tiny sting rays were sitting in the middle of their huge swimming pool. I know my son was really looking forward to touching the sting-rays (he does every year at the phoenix zoo, and loves it), unfortunately, they were not moving from the middle of their pool. Overall, it's a nice facility. If you are a butterfly enthusiast, it's nice to see, but don't expect to see a wide variety of butterflies. It took us about 1 hour and 35 minutes to go through everything.  I could see other families finishing quicker, especially if you have younger children who want to move on to the next thing and have a short attention span."}
{"text":"This place is everything you would expect. Educated you on butterfly's and a shit load of butterfly's. Definitely worth checking out at least one time"}
{"text":"This place is magical! Admission is a little pricey, but definitely worth checking out at least once. You first watch a 3-D movie on the life of a butterfly - very interesting information, and the 3D glasses make it fun to watch for children and adults. You then go into the garden where there are about 2,500 butterflies roaming freely in a rainforest environment. We saw a few kids picking up and touching the butterflies which was infuriating and really sad as you are told multiple times to not do this as the oils from your fingers can kill them. Just me venting on the parents not watching the kids :) I believe there are about 40 different species of butterflies in this atrium and they are all as beautiful as each other. You then go back into the main building where you can see ant colonies, spiders, snakes, fish, etc. It probably took us an hour to go through the whole thing. This is apparently the largest butterfly atrium in the US; we are fortunate to have it here locally!"}
{"text":"Myself my wife and my 2 daughters (mature8&9) were visiting Arizona from Southern California. We decided to check out Americas largest butterfly exhibit. Price for adults was 20$ and kids were 13$. We found a coupon for 3$ off each ticket online. Go in the morning before lunch or go after lunch to avoid eating there and large crowds. U will not need more than 3 hours here total.   ---We were a little worried that it would be to \"babyish\" for our girls. But alas it was not!!! We went during the week and if you go on a weekday expect lots of field trips from elementary schools. That did not inhibit our wonderful experience though.   It starts with the amazing and informative 14 minute 3D movie. Which we all thoroughly enjoyed! Then u go into a smaller room where the butterfly's (behind glass) are not only in their cocoons but are coming out of them. U then get to go into the main attraction - the butterfly atrium!!!! A-mazing ! U can spend as much time in the atrium as u want so peaceful, beautiful and relaxing. You see butterfly's from all over the world in every color that u can think of!! My kids faces when a butterfly landed on them was worth the price of admission! You then go into a very small aquarium where u can touch the stingrays:)   ---- ice cream and drinks were WAY overpriced for a place like this. While we did not eat there I wouldn't recommend it food didn't even look that great. Skip the gift shop and snack shop."}
{"text":"Butterfly wonderland is definitely a WONDER LAND. The place is very clean and organized. Their 3D show is OK(not so great) but it is included with your ticket so sit and relax for 14 mins. Each adult ticket is 20$ at the counter but you can buy a $50 gift card in Costco for $37. There is plenty of parking which is also free. Enjoy!!!!!"}
{"text":"We got some beautiful pics of our kids with their cousins here. Its a little pricey but its a beautiful facility and unique place to visit. The kids all really enjoyed it and having the butterflies land on them was enjoyed by all and I did get some very unique photographs during our visit. We will definitely return when relatives visit."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.  We went here with a group of 4 kids and 6 adults recently, and all of us had an incredible time.  I can't get over this.  It was so much fun for kids AND adults that we've recommended it to anyone who has asked recently for things to do in the Scottsdale area.  The 3D Movie is wonderful.  There is a glass casing where you can see all types of butterflies being born before your very eyes.  Then you go into a room where tons and tons of butterflies are flying all around you, landing on your head, clothes ... it was beautiful.  Plus, there's a bouncy house for the kids.  Not too shabby!  SO FUN!  ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"This was such a fun experience! Highly recommended !It was kind of a magical experience, watching all The butterflies fly around us. Clean, helpful staff and very educational! Wonderful all the way around!"}
{"text":"So pretty here!! You start off by going in a 3D movie, which has information on the lives of butterflies. After that, we got to go in an exhibition that has a lot of cocoons where caterpillars are in the process of transforming into butterflies. It was pretty cool. We were able to go inside the actual butterfly area after. There were so many of them! They were all different colors and sizes. You just have to be careful where you step because there are some that are on the ground. The workers warns everyone beforehand not to touch the butterflies with fingers because our oils will make them lose their sense of taste. Luckily some of them landed on my shoulder and head haha. It was such a great experience!"}
{"text":"When I went to see the butterflies, I was not in a good mood.  That quickly changed when I entered the Butterfly Wonderland.  When I entered the butterfly room, I felted as if I had walked into a Disney movie feeling like Snow White.  This is a wonderful place.  Yes, the cost is high, but there is a lot that goes into taking care of the butterflies, plant, nectar, humidity sprayers, etc.  All of this beauty in one place is just great.  I also loved the migration movie.  It really puts things in perspective.  I likes the cocoons as well.  There are improvements that can be made, but I will come back next year and see if they are folding the money back into the environment to bring people back with new items."}
{"text":"Oh what a wonderful place...my girlfriend took me here as a surprise...it's a feel good place...can't explain the peaceful atmosphere... definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"My husband and I were just big kids at Butterfly Wonderland! We were here during the Winter Wonderland Extravaganza and they had Christmas decorations up and women dressed up as angels. Beautiful addition to the experience! The 3D movie was very informative and even though they said it was 15 minutes long, it certainly didn't seem like it, which means it was good. Even the kids in the theater paid attention which is a rare thing to see! Seeing the butterflies hatching was really cool and I'm glad we got to see the moth that almost a foot wide. The atrium was enormous and thankfully wasn't too hot! Many gorgeous butterflies flitting everywhere and the waterfall with koi was a beautiful addition. The pathways are well thought out and they even have birds in residence that eat bugs, yet they don't eat butterflies. The bee/bug/spider/scorpion exhibits are great & the fish are wonderful. The rays LOVED me! We even got a commemorative photo which we rarely do, we're going to scan it to share with family and friends. Definitely a worthwhile experience and we'd love to come back when the OdySea aquarium is finished!"}
{"text":"The Butterfly Conservatory is amazing!   You walk the grounds of this huge atrium and there are probably thousands of butterflies frolicking around water fountains and people! That right, people! They fly right up to you, your shoulders, your head, your purse and just..... chill.They also have bee colony, ant colony, scorpions, different species of amazon fish. You can stick your hands in the Touch Tank to pet some rays.  Not just a great place for kids but for adults as well. I can honestly say I was schooled on a few things I did not know about butterflies and moths!"}
{"text":"WOW...this place is cool!! Butterflies in the desert, who knew? They start you out with a 3d movie about the flight of the monarch. Very informative and fun to watch, then on to the butterflies...I felt like I was in the amazon. The only downside is it is very warm and muggy inside so dress light. The butterflies like it warm. My kids are still talking about this trip."}
{"text":"I had so much fun!!! Workers were sweet and the butterflies were super cool! I totally got landed on by lots of butterflies. Also, there are coy fish in the butterfly sanctuary. Great for kids and adults."}
{"text":"I have been to Butterfly Wonderland three times this past month.  I'm a grownup with a camera.  Every time I come, the nursery is in different stages of hatch and the butterflies in the garden are different and active.  It is a beautiful place to come and take photos or just look.  I do have one suggestion, it would be nice to have one day where the school children didn't come.  That would give the children with their parents and other adults a bit more room to maneuver.    With that being said, I was there in the mornings each time knowing that there would be busloads of little guys and gals.  It didn't change my mind.  There have been several comments about the prices, It's worth it."}
{"text":"Great experience. Kids loved the place! Wish they had more interactive stuff for kids. It is hard for kids to not touch."}
{"text":"Caution consumers! Specifically this poor review belongs to the Mirror Maze part of Butterfly Wonderland. As annual members of Butterfly Wonderland they sent both me and my girlfriend an email that says this... \"As a member of Butterfly Wonderland we are extending a sneak peak at the newest must see in Scottsdale. Just print out this email and you will RECEIVE ONE COMPLIMENTARY WALK-THROUGH PASS.\"  Seems simple enough but it was at best a bait and switch and more accurately an outright lie.  Adding to the nastiness was a  discourteous staff that found pleasure in being very abrupt about telling us the offer was a mistake which they had no intention of honoring and was good only for a quick single walk through of only their laser area of the venue.  We had two choices.  Pay $9.95 plus tax  per person for each of us and our two children (6 and 4 years old) or we were free to leave. I paid the $43 bucks and we walked through the mirror maze. This Mirror Maze part is not worth the extra fee! My advice is to wait for the carnival to come to town.  The Mirror Maze you'll find in a carnival funhouse will be more entertaining and the carnie staff likely more courteous."}
{"text":"Great place for kids. Nothing like beautiful butterflies of many different colors and sizes landing on you. My 4 year old was in awe! The staff was great and the garden was full of so many different butterflies."}
{"text":"The entry fee for this place is somewhat exorbitant for what you get. I have been to better butterfly conservatories that charge the same $18...one of them in Callaway Gardens in Georgia. Check them out on the internet.   The show starts with an educational 3D movie about the life cycle and migration of Monarch butterflies which was actually quite good. The 3D glasses were functional. I would have felt better if disinfectant wipes were available being a germaphobe. The conservatory is small although packed with butterflies that lacked variety. There are also a few tanks of delicious looking fish that would look better on the grill and a little pool to pet a skate fish or ray. They also had a few tanks of ants and spiders.   The items in the gift shop were not overpriced as the toys in Disneyland and the  quality was above average although they did have those made-in-China plastic pieces of...  Overall a pleasant experience but would not dream of coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and it is a must see for anyone who can enjoy the true beauty of nature! They start off with an awesome 3D film where you feel as if you're in the forest with hundreds of butterflies. The actual wonderland with all the butterflies is fascinating! I recommend wearing blues, greens, or red colors as the butterflies are more attracted to them and in turn will land on your clothing!"}
{"text":"We took the kids to this and they had a great time. The IMAX movie was great. The kids had fun taking photos of all the different butterflies. We were visiting family in Phoenix, so it was a 30 minute drive. We spent about 2 hours there and the kids also enjoyed petting the manta rays."}
{"text":"I found this place out by a group I belong to. I decided to go ahead instead. I wasn't disappointed. The cost is a bit high. $20 for just me. First they take you into a theatre to watch in 3-D the flight of the monarch butterflies then you go into a small room with large windows showing cocoon butterflies coming out of them. There is such wild metallic gold and silver ones but they were not hatching. Just wish the room was bigger because after the theatre everyone is crabbed into this small room. You have a choice of entering the butterfly exhibit or view the hatching. The minute you go into the live butterfly exhibit they land on you. There is so many different species to take pictures of them.  The area gets really humid and uncomfortable so you leave to the air conditioned cafe or to the ant, bee, aquarium  and stingrays. Amazing large aquariums with someone to tell you about the exhibit. I thought this place was very educational and relaxing even with the large crowd."}
{"text":"This was a really neat one-time experience. If you have kids or if you are fascinated with butterflies, head on over. Lots of road construction on the 101 near here and construction at the site to add on a large aquarium. Tickets are very pricey for what is included( approx. $45 for two adults). Luckily under 3 is free, so we didn't pay for kiddo. We went on a Friday around 11:30 and there were four school buses leaving. Whew!   It starts with a short 3D video about butterfly life cycles and then you can view butterfly cocoons before heading into the conservatory. This part was really cool and our son was amazed by seeing the different colorful species fly right by his face. Bring a camera and dress for hot/humid temps because they fog up this bad boy for the butterflies and plants to thrive. There are also birds and a coy pond. After the conservatory, you can view insects in action and view the small aquarium before exiting through the gift shop.   I don't know that we will be back due to the price but we are glad we went once."}
{"text":"Favorite place I've been since being in AZ. I enjoyed this more than the aquarium in all honesty. There is a cool 3D movie before you get in the conservatory, and a REALLY cool room where they keep the cocoons. You can see some butterflies hatching, and it's amazing seeing all the variations of cocoons. I wish I spent more time in here.   My only complaint was the amount of people in the conservatory. I went on a Thursday at 2pm and I felt like there wasn't enough room to walk with all the kids running around. I would try to go earlier next time.   Can't wait to come back soon!"}
{"text":"It was just okay for the price.  The movie was great, the exhibit itself was decent but not for what we paid to get in.  They really should lower the price if they want to attract families."}
{"text":"In A Nutshell:  -Butterfly Wonderland in Scottsdale, AZ is a great place to take anyone who loves nature. -You'll learn and see all about the various stages of a butterfly's life. -You'll also be able to see them first hand and if you wear bright colors you might even have some land on you. -There's also a small aquarium and terrariums w/ reptiles and amphibians.  Overall, it's a very cool place to see and learn about butterflies."}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun exploring the conservatory and fish tanks, but it felt like it fell a little short for what we paid in admission and how long it took for us to see everything. I think we would have liked it to be a little bigger (and maybe a little leas humid) in there. But I do admit, there were plenty of tropical butterflies and a photographer's dream it capture it all.  It seems like the younger children had a more difficult time staying in their seats and staying quiet through the 3D movie, I think mainly because the movie was so calm and quiet. It was a good experience and the kid liked it, but I don't think I'd get a membership just yet because we walked through it fairly quickly. I really wish there was more hands-on, interactive displays or shows about butterflies."}
{"text":"I am from CA and was in the area to go to the mayo clinic for 2 weeks (march 2015) and I absolutely fell in love with this place!  I would go here over and over again.  it was a beautiful and peaceful experience I will never forget.  the staff was wonderful, I wanted to buy everything in the gift shop and the butterflies and garden were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Neat place in Arizona where you are able to see butterflies year round. The place is actually smaller than I thought. However, there was tons of butterflies in the exhibit. After seeing the butterflies there is a other places to view such as bees, fish, and ants. This area was not very exciting after seeing butterflies and there was poor lighting. All in all this is a great place to take visitors to experience butterflies. However, don't go on a weekday during in the am. There is tons of school groups making it a little bit crazy... But the experience was still nice."}
{"text":"Things to bring :Camera- Full Phone Charge for pics/video-Wear Yellow/Blue/White Colors AND smell sweet.  My sister and I got there before 10 and received $5.00 off . Which you'll want to use in the Butterfly Cafe.   The 3D movie (included) was excellent quality & informative, then we watched butterflies come out of their cocoons in the nursery. AMAZING. Next we are off into the Butterfly Garden.   Truly magical .... hundreds of butterflies of different species, finches, canaries, tropical foliage, water features, kio, etc.    STAFF & KEEPERS are engaging & knowledgeable. Our day started at 9:30 ended at 3:00."}
{"text":"Had a very nice time. 3D Movie was excellent and the butterfly room was breathtaking as expected. Aquarium was small but nice. Didn't take too long to see everything and was a bit pricey especially if you have a couple of kids in tow. Centrally located which makes it easy to get to and bear lots of other stuff. Don't miss the honey bees."}
{"text":"Extraordinary Magical place! Wear bright colored clothes. I wore a super yellow top and butterflies were landing on my shoulders, chest, hand, arm, back and head! Take your camera. Entrance fee is pricey and they don't take ARRP but they do take AAA for a discount. If you take your younger children...please control them! One of the rules are don't touch the butterflies, don't chase them........I witnessed a couple of brats doing such. If you have a child in a stroller...Watch where you steer!!!! A must see for sure."}
{"text":"I'll be honest.  I'm not a huge butterfly fan.  In general, I'm not a fan of things flying at my face (even pretty things) but my friend wanted to go as part of a birthday outing.    The 3D movie was actually really cool and probably would have been even better had it not been for the children in front of me who were never taught how to behave in public.    The butterfly-ararium (?) was quite nifty as well.  It's similar to the yearly Butterfly House at the Desert Botanical Gardens but on a much larger (and more permanent) scale.  There are LOTS of photo ops here so bring your camera.  Apparently, butterflies like the spa so prepare yourself for a sauna-esque environment.  (My pores were so open afterward!).    There are also other exhibits too...ant farms, bee hives, fish and a sting-ray pool.  Most of the stingrays were anti-social but there was one that seemed to enjoy gliding along the top and making little girls (including me) squeal.  I have no idea how stingrays relate to butterflies but I suppose it's less random than say, giraffes."}
{"text":"I was on a family trip to AZ with my husband and kid to see my cousins. They took us to this plaxe which turned out to be so much fun. As soon as u walk in u u go to this room and watch a short 3D movie about the life of a butterfly.. looooved this movie! So interseting!! then u just walk thru the double doors to the butterfly garden, it was amazing, u could see all kinds and shapes and colors; big and small, thousands of butterflies;pretty cool. The kids were so thrilled. Then we walked out to another room, they had snakes, lizards, frogs and more cool animals in there.. this place is Clean and well taken care of, very friendly staff! It was a nice experience. Totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is a great escape in the desert. A garden of beauty for butterflies and guests!"}
{"text":"Butterfly Wonderland is amazing ! My son and I really enjoyed ! We have been couple times at this place and would back again ! We had so relaxing time out there ! Butterflies seating on your back , had , shoulders ! Very nice atmosphere and perfect enjoyable temperature inside ."}
{"text":"I visited the Butterfly Wonderland on a Sunday and was quite surprised to find it pretty packed, the parking lot had little parking I noticed quite a few people parking along the dirt in the back. My first thought was that they needed a bigger parking lot and more plants,flowers,ect around the building to brighten it up a little. The building itself looks great it has an eye catching shape but the grounds lack a bit of luster, putting a lot of flowers around the outside would help attract the butterflies that are naturally around AZ and would let you begin your 'Experience' even before you walk through the door.   After paying we entered to being our tour, I noticed they had a Mirror and laser maze attached to the building which was a seperate cost but we didn't check out out on this visit. Our experience started off with a short 3D movie, The glasses worked well and the closer you were the better it was. I was standing off to the side holding my toddler during the movie, the angle I was standing at made the butterflies seem like they were really floating by it almost made me want to wave them away before they hit my face. The movie was entertaining and educational, Next you move into the 'Hatching' room where they have dozens of butterfly cocoons hanging from boxes to view as they emerge from their cozy cocoons. I was fascinated and surprised to see the amount of different cocoons, some were bright green others were metallic gold, one looked like a spiders egg sack it was amazing to see them and to see the butterflies who had recently emerged sitting drying their wings.   If you go in Spring/slightly cooler weather and bring a sweat shirt, prepare to take it off as you enter the butterfly habitat it is humid and warm which is perfect for the butterflies. My family loved the butterfly habitat they are fearless little guys from getting used to seeing people, they fly right by you, will land on you, and may even bump into you from time to time I found even when my camera was sitting just an inch or two away from one of them they didn't fly away which made for some pretty good photo opporunities. I was slightly upset that I saw an african moon/lunar moth in the hatching room but didn't see any in the actual butterfly habiat. I enjoyed their selection of butterflies, We wish it was a slightly bigger building but it suited our interest. After there is a cafe which smelled good but we didn't purchase anything, a room with spiders, scorpians and bees we enjoyed watching the bees come in and out of the building carrying polen back to the hive. Following that room were tanks with assorted fish and a string ray petting tank, The attendant seemed a little rude but I am sure he deals with a lot through out the day. The gift shop was decently price, some things were over priced but that is part of how they make their money.   Over all it was a happy and exciting experience, I would visit again in the future. You do get quite a bit for the $11(kids), $20 (adults) price you have to keep in mind that not only do you get to explore and see the bugs,fish, ect but it cost quite a bit to keep them all living comfortably and happily."}
{"text":"If you like bugs then this is the place for you! I personally dont like butterflys landing on me hahaha!! But its an enjoyable experience if you want to see the life cycles also there are other bug attractions such as a bee hive where bees come and go, ant mounds and stingrays swimming."}
{"text":"This was a lovely place. The views of the ACTUAL chrysalises were fascinating (we thought they were fake!) The staff at every encounter were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  There is not a tremendous amount to it for the admission, but would be worth it if outdoor activities were on hold due to weather or the like"}
{"text":"This place is STRICT! That is because they want their butterflies to thrive.  Before going in with a group of kids they sat us down and gave us very rigid instructions on how to walk and act in the butterfly habitat.  They enforced that if one child didn't follow the rules then the whole group would be asked to leave! Luckily my kids did great and we all had a good time.   It starts with the 4D movie about a butterflies life.  Very cute movie.  Then you are shown how Butterfly Wonderland receives their stock. (We were able to see a worker add some new butterflies)  After that, you are brought into the observatory.  If you want butterflies to land on you wear bright colors!  You are instructed to walk slowly and to not touch butterflies with your hands. This is a beautiful area and I would suggest early in the morning because it gets very humid.  After the butterfly habitat there's a cafe and then the room with the aquariums and rays.  Once you're finished with the sea life you are lead back to the front inside the gift shop.    I enjoyed my trip to Butterfly Wonderland, and I know my schoolkids did too! We'd come back on another field trip."}
{"text":"Very interesting, but very crowded on a Saturday afternoon. Kind of expensive for the experience."}
{"text":"I feel so lucky to have this in my city!  What a beautiful and amazing experience for my family! The facility and the staff were A+.  We also really enjoyed the Native Storytellers sharing their culture with us."}
{"text":"We took visitors since this is one of the remarkable places for tourists in Scottsdale. We had been here before. On a patriotic holiday weekend they had red, white and blue butterflies in addition to the usual. We appreciate how much the vegetation has grown. We think the koi pond is great. What is best is being surrounded by clouds of butterflies.  Several landed on my flowered shirt and flew away disappointed.   In addition, there is an interesting film about the life of monarch butterflies, a butterfly hatchery and. small aquarium.  The girls we brought were thrilled by the experience.  Paying admission I was asked for student ID which they didn't have. I pointed out that they are 16 which got me Student Rate but perhaps was not really required. Is there that much admission fraud."}
{"text":"Loved Butterfly Wonderland. The movie was absolutely terrific, worth the price of admission. There were so many different butterfly types. The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.  There was also a small aquarium. Good for about two hours."}
{"text":"Really cool place. The 3d experiance with the monarch butterfly was cool. But the best part was the crazy immersion into the butterflys rainforest like emvironment. The blue ones fly around like crazy and some just hangout. Definitely perfect for the whole family. And something to do to get out of the heat."}
{"text":"Visiting Butterfly Wonderland was never on my \"to see\" list.  I LOVE butterflies, but I have been to some really good butterfly gardens in my life.  When my sister came to town this last time, she wanted to go.  So we went!  I will start with the bad, and end on good...  Bad - It's expensive.  We both got student discounts and our tickets were over $20.  The place is mostly a large greenhouse.    Could be bad - The first stop is a movie, when the movie is over the whole theater goes to the Emergence Gallery (where you can see butterfly emerge from their cocoon).  Then the whole theater group goes into the Conservatory.  There were about 12 in our movie viewing so everyone had a chance to look into the emergence cases and we had plenty of personal space.  I can anticipate problems with crowds if the movie is even at a quarter of capacity.  The good - The staff was very nice.  The Conservatory is beautiful!  The butterflies are so active!  We got a lot of great pictures."}
{"text":"I would give them 6 stars if I could!   This place is so fun! I've brought my almost two year old daughter here twice now and she LOVES the \"fly-ayes\".  There is a 3D movie that you watch before going in but I have to skip it due to my migraines. The kids seemed to love it though.    Then you get to see the butterflies as they hatch.  The people who work in this place are super helpful and can answer all your questions.  They are friendly and attentive and we talked to several of the employees about the butterflies and how they hatch.  Then they bring you into the habitat which is a bit warm - 80 degrees and humid - because that's how the butterflies like it!  Then you will not believe your eyes as you roam around in an enclosure with HUNDREDS of butterflies - the guy inside told us 800 a week are replenished.  AWESOME.  So many different types of butterflies that I had never seen before.  And there is a small pond with large fish you can feed (the employees have food). My daughter loved everything - she loved walking around and seeing plants and butterflies and she even liked looking at the honey bee hive they have in the corner.    There is a snack bar and tons of tables/chairs when you leave the enclosure.  And then there are a few tanks with some fresh water fish and the gift shop.  Tons of cute and unique butterfly themed gifts, artwork, toys and clothes.  Really a fun day!  And the perfect trip for even a small child because you can spend a half day here and feel like you really did everything.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We just had a family day at Butterfly Wonderland. As others have said it's a little pricey, over 70.00 for 4 of us.  The 3D movie in the beginning is educational and fun... but it gets pretty amazing when you're let into the greenhouse area. I never thought I could be overwhelmed my butterflies but they are everywhere...and quite friendly!! Haha one of them landed on my hand and laid an egg on my thumb...no joke.  Our daughters were a little freaked out when the butterflies tried to land on them, but overall LOVED IT!! This would be a great place to take visitors or for a special time with family!!"}
{"text":"Fun experience , although not an inexpensive adventure    There were plenty of butterflies dancing around to be able to really admire their beauty. It was interesting watching them feed. My sweet little 3 year old companion enjoyed herself. Looking at the fish after leaving the butterflies was nice."}
{"text":"OK OK, I was totally making fun of Butterfly Wonderland. It was near my hotel, and I kept passing it by on my way to do other stuff. \"A butterfly exhibit? How boring\" I said to myself. However, after checking out of the hotel, I found myself with several hours to kill before I needed to get to the airport, and as a joke, decided to check this place out.  Omg...it's worth it. You start off with a movie about monarch butterflies which was pretty informative, if a little dull. Then you're in a room where you can see cocoons, and that was neat. BUT, then you're let into a large greenhouse that is filled with butterflies and it's really quite impressive. There are a lot of varieties --- enough that you're constantly discovering a new one. And the plants and walkway is laid out so that you can get up close and personal with these butterflies.  Surprisingly, I burned through 2 hours here! Very unexpected and a fun little way to kill some time."}
{"text":"Great experience. We live in a dry desert, so enjoy the rainforest environment. It's humid, so dress appropriately. The movie was really great, staff and volunteers were helpful. Butterflies and the large moths are magnificent."}
{"text":"This place is very nice.  We decided to go on a Sunday around 10:30, I was surprised how busy it was.  We were 3 adults and 2 children, we had a coupon for up to $12 off, so it ended up costing around $76 for all.  Once you are in, they take you souvenir picture and then you can wait to watch the 3D movie or head to the butterfly area.  We decided to wait for the movie since it was only one minute away.  I am glad we did.  Even my kids loved the movie.  It was so funny to see them try to catch the 3D butterflies.  Once the movie is over you step into the Butterfly emergence gallery, where you can see the different stages of a bunch of butterflies, we saw some about to go from chrysalis to butterfly, it was really amazing.  After you enter a chamber and then there is the door to the Conservatory, where all the butterflies are.  This part is awesome.  There are so many varieties of butterflies flying all over and they can  even land on you.  My little boy loved it.   While my little boy stayed in the conservatory with dad and grandma, my little girl and I went to see the rest.  Before exiting you go to another chamber where you check in the mirror if you have any butterflies on you, since they want to make sure none escape.   You head out and walk through the small cafe and then there is a small room with 3 little glass tanks, one with a huge black scorpion, the other with a large hairy spider and the third one with the scorpions you see all over the place here in the valley, little brownish ones.  They have placed a couple of black light flashlights so you see how scorpions glow in the dark with the flashlight.  That part only took us about 5 minutes.   The last exhibit had a few fish tanks some with fresh water fish and others with ocean fishes.  They also have a viewing tank, they explained it is not a touch tank anymore because besides the rays, they have now 3 kinds of small sharks. The tricky part is the exit, you have to go through the souvenir store, so it is hard to leave without spending more money,  I guess that is the purpose.  Good thing grandma bought them a couple of things so the twins were happy.  Overall it is a great experience."}
{"text":"This place was great!  I can here with my gf and her friend and got to see a lot of beautiful butterflies, interesting insects, reptiles and fish.  I wish we could've touched the fish, but it was overall really great to experience a bit of nature in the middle of the desert"}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Took my Mom here who is in a wheelchair. She loved it. Very serene, butterflies are literally every where and so many varieties! Very educational too."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I went here for the first time last weekend. In short, for a wonderful detached (from technology) time by yourself or with the family, then you have to visit this place.  Butterfly Wonderland is a pleasant surprise.  It is a photographer's treat.  I was like a kid in a candy store with my camera.    The garden is wonderful and the variety of butterflies all around you is simply amazing."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful hidden treasure! I can't believe it's been in Arizona for three years already! For $20 an adult, you learn about butterflies and months, see a 3-D movie, have the opportunity to witness them emerging from their cacoons or chrystalis, a conservatory full of butterflies from around the world, some Arizona desert native creatures, a honeybee hive (it was closed when we went), and finally some native fish of the Amazon!! Well worth the entrance fee!   The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and enthusiastic.   If you plan to come back, purchase a annual pass and you pay for it in 2.5 trips! Well worth it and a great place to take visitors! I can't wait to come back and visit again soon!"}
{"text":"So, I am, or was, petrified of moths.  They totally freaked me out.  Because of my visit to this magical place I'm not so much afraid anymore.  (Thank God, I can now leave my doors open at night in beautiful weather and not be uptight about them flying in. )  After my sister and her husband paid over one hundred dollars for four adults and three children, we walked in and were able to catch a three d movie before experiencing the magical wonderland.  (Not being sarcastic either...it was amazing!)  But the movie was also exceptionally great.  With your nifty glasses, it appeared as if the butterflies were all over the theater.  And, it wasn't a boring documentary either.  The way the narrator told the story of one butterfly's life journey caused me to actually feel personally involved with this fragile creature.  It was time to enter this fairy tale like area where the butterflies gracefully fluttered in the hundreds.  They were everywhere.  We were told to watch where we stepped so as not to step on any that land on the path.  I have never seen so many butterflies in all my life.  It really was  quite magical for me.   When all my group was ready for a snack we went to the cafe.  Yes, terribly expensive, but it's relative. You'll need to remember I'm pretty cheap. Let me give you an example:  A pbj, the kind my students received when going on a field trip, a bag of chips and I can't remember what else, cost close to $5.   There is also a room with fish, sting rays that you were able to \"pet\" , and a few displays of bees, spiders, scorpions, (complete with a black light) ants, and a giant centipede. However, after being in the mystical room of butterflies, I wasn't impressed.  The butterfly wonderland is a hard act to follow.   The last thing I want to mention is that the staff was very friendly. There was a  guy who was busy caring for the butterfly room and as I stopped to take a pic, he asked if I had questions, which I did. The employees were great.    Yes, I would definitely recommend a trip to Butterfly Wonderland.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I thought it was pretty pricey.  But then again, as I mentioned before, I\"m cheap.  So, you decide."}
{"text":"I like this place, I like the idea of this place, I like the message of conservation and respect for nature that this place seems to support....  20$ a head is still kind of expensive and younger kids don't enjoy themselves as much.  It's more of an experience for someone that wants to go on a relaxing stroll and take a few pictures.    The facility is super small.  You will see butterflies and that's it.  The other exhibits (bee hive, terrariums with a few small Desert critters, and some fish tanks) are pitiful."}
{"text":"Me and the family went here one morning before lunch (4 adults and a 1 1/2 year old). There was no line to purchase tickets and it was quite expensive with 3 military discounted priced tickets. We next went to the theater for the 3D movie which was a 15 minute wait but was supposed to be a 5 minute wait. The baby was getting pretty impatient for the movie to begin. Once we got in the 3D graphics of the butterflies were really good at which the butterflies were right in your face. We left the movie early due to the baby getting cranky. The other animal exhibits were pretty cool but didn't get to enjoy them since we rushed through due to the child. The butterfly area was really beautiful and wasnt that hot at all. I was fine in it.  ** Don't bring any children under the age of 5 since you can't touch anything or else except the stingray exhibit.     ** I would have enjoyed it way more with just my husband if we were the only ones that went and so I could take my good old time through it.   ** Will not be going back here because the prices are just too high for us to afford again."}
{"text":"I love this place! I got an annual membership and visit often. It's so calming and beautiful. Makes me feel at peace. It's a great escape from the busyness of life."}
{"text":"The place is expensive and not great for kids/families looking for an indoor activity during summer. It is hot, humid & not pleasant inside. Only go if you are one of the following:  1. A butterfly enthusiast (think, obsession level) 2. That person who is always cold, looking for a warm environment   That's about it.   If admission was $5 then I'd give it 3 stars but the 2nd star is me being nice..."}
{"text":"Such a cool place! I've never been anywhere like Butterfly Wonderland before. It felt like a tropical forest in there! There was the heat, the humidity, being surrounded by greenery and then, of course, the exotic butterflies fluttering about!  I will admit, it took me some getting used to. I typically flinch at things flitting about. And let me tell you, they flit! But they are gorgeous and they are so interesting to watch and admire (surprisingly enough). We noticed that if you are wearing colorful clothing and you sit on the benches, butterflies will land on you. It's pretty fun, actually.   I was super intrigued by the really cool exhibit right at the entrance of the wonderland rainforest. It shows you each step of the transformation process from caterpillar to butterfly. Super cool! And, on the way out, they have a cool room with big aquariums and some sweet fish. There's also a pool in the middle where you can pet the sting-rays. Not sure if this will stay once the aquarium opens up next door, but I think it should!   I actually found a few cute items at the gift shop and I genuinely enjoyed my visit. What a fun place to spend an afternoon with the family!"}
{"text":"This is a must visit place!  You start by getting your photo taken.   These are for sale at the end of your visit in the gift shop. After pictures you see a 3D movie.  It was very well done.  Once you leave the theater you visit a little room where there are cocoons ready to open!  Then comes the big event....the butterfly room!  No strollers allowed.  You will have to park them outside the door.  It's a garden paradise complete with benches to sit, a waterfall & a pool with huge goldfish! The best part is that butterfly's will land on you! Once you leave the butterfly garden, you enter the snack shop.  Next comes a room with desert animals.  The little ones enjoyed using the black light flashlights to look for scorpions.  From there you go to an aquarium like room.  The centerpiece is a large pool with rays that you can touch. All around the pool are tanks with different fish. From there you go into the gift shop."}
{"text":"If you've never been to a butterfly exhibit, this is the one to see. They have an incredible variety of butterflies, every color in the rainbow. The plants in the conservatory are pretty spectacular too. The adult admission of twenty dollars is kind of high, however I'm okay with the nicely done educational experience this attraction provides.   Your admission includes:  The butterfly conservatory Movie: Flight of the Butterflies Butterfly Emergence Gallery An Active bee hive A Stingray petting pool  I spent a couple of hours watching these delicate winged creatures. I was mesmerized by the lime green and tropical blue butterflies. FYI - the blue butterflies are attracted to blue clothing!  Little kids need to be reminded that some of the butterflies rest on the floor and should watch their step at all times. This is not the place to run around or jump off stairs. One little boy had to be reminded.  Located in a newly developed area of Scottsdale. I will take others to see this when visiting in the area."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised at how we enjoyed this butterfly pavilion. Seeing butterflies drying their wings after emerging from their cocoon was wonderfully charming. The courtyard had an abundant variety of butterflies and flowers for them to munch. All in all, it was a great stop. We recommend it. Oh...wear a brightly colored shirt, preferably with flowers,  the butterflies may very well go for a ride on your shirt."}
{"text":"The \"mandatory movie\" when you first enter is annoying- we came with out 13 month old and the guy regulating the movie/entrance made it seem like we weren't allowed in the museum without watching the monarch migration movie, we waited 10 minutes for the next movie (the movie is 14 minutes long) and realized we could easily by-step the movie. Honestly it was ridiculous and a waste of time to make us stand there waiting when you can go into the museum without interrupting the movie. The rest of the museum was oddly laid out and had random exhibits. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is the butterfly conservatory. That was really neat- and our son loved watching the butterflies."}
{"text":"What an incredible experience on a 110 degree day in Arizona en route to Chicago.  Beautiful butterflies in their habitat - perfect length 3d movie.  I could have stayed for hours"}
{"text":"Well worth the money----  Food choices were limited, I wish they offered more and had a theme to the food.  I am a little surprised that a staff member told me they are not there to talk about the butterflies---but rather to make sure everyone behaved?!?!?!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect to go to in the summer or if you have visitors. The butterfly sanctuary is beautiful and it's truly awesome whether your a child or an adult."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun place for children and adults alike. The butterflies are gorgeous and the cocoon exhibit was my favorite -- I got to watch metapods morph into butterfrees! (pokemon reference if you're a noob). It's pretty humid so I got drowsy after 10 minutes ... but I thoroughly enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Amazing experience with the butterflies all around you. You will definitely pay for it. They have a small reptile exhibit compare to others but cool none the less. Also a marine exhibit. Kids loved the butterflies."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  Amazing!! Great 3D movie about the migration of the Monarch butterflies! LOVE being in the butterfly room with sooo many species and having them land on you so often!  Some of THE most beautiful butterflies I've ever seen!!"}
{"text":"I believe the replies made by Butterfly Wonderland to some of the posts here pretty much sums up the experience here. It's just enough to be courteous but nothing extraordinary to make you want to come back. Why would a company provide canned responses that say \"I'm sorry for your experience!\" -and love the exclamation point in the end.   First I just want to say I have been looking forward to this for awhile. I've been talking about the building when it first came up and the future plans that are yet to come with the aquarium and Ripley's. I really hope this place does not represent what is yet to come.  First from the 101 freeway on outside this place looks to be nice and air conditioned. Oh my goodness please don't pay for a gym membership just come here for a sauna!  Yes we came when it was 115 degrees out but are you kidding me everyone was sweating buckets for how hot and humid this place was. I think we stayed in the butterfly area for 15 minutes. 10 of those minutes was close to the back where the \"air\" was. Seriously visit the 6 other months when it's nicer.   Which leaves me to this conclusion....what is this place thinking?  This is the desert. We Phoenicians love our AC at 75. No one goes out of the house unless there is an opportunity for shelter in an icebox.    This place is expensive at $20 a person.  I was willing to pay the price but expected so much more value. I've been to the butterfly habitat in a Six flags in Northern California and I felt like I had a much more enjoyable butterfly experience there than this dedicated place. Let me offer some tips to justify this price tag and bring more people in: 1. Seriously...board those windows up and get A/C and get rid of that humidity If its not the right climate for the butterflies then you better find some that do.  The other butterfly habitat I was at it was outdoors but was not humid and I believe it was about 80 degrees. You absolutely need to consider this to survive in the desert and for us locals to help spread the word on your establishment.   2.  Your employees better add to the experience than do the bare minimum. Try smiling, interact with the guests...add to the experience and don't just stock items. Those opening closing \"protect the butterfly\" human door guards need to have more personality. That was everyone's first and last experience of this place and it was blah. They need better coaching to bring their A game.   3.  The second half of the exhibit... What the heck is that? Random ant farms from hobby stores and scorpions that look like teens are trying to keep? I mean can you do better than a blacklight flashlight on a chain that doesn't work? Wire up a cheap button to light up a strip black light.    I really hope there are bigger plans for this it just really looked rushed or not well planned out. I think the bees thing was cool but the \"experience\" of it wasn't. It just wasn't presented well.   I love that the bees fly on and out of the building themselves. Yet there was nothing that told me that and it seemed hidden. I have no idea about the fish...I'm assuming they were inexpensive compared to the other fish and so you bought them.   4.  Upkeep. New building and there's paint missing and tape holding up the wall in the bee area? Cheap paper signs telling me to give me my ticket?  Think experience. This is my first impression. You paid thousands of dollars to get those giant butterflies in the ceiling and you go cheap on signs and upkeep?  Cafeteria get an interior designer. It just feels like a high school cafeteria than part of an \"amusement park\".   5.  Make this place more kid friendly. Maybe allow strollers. Nothing like holding a sweaty 97 degree kid next to me so she doesn't squash anything. Have a play area? I don't know we're customers you should know your clientele. This place obviously is to attract young families so think that way.   6.  Get tons more butterflies.  Okay now I'm ranting... If you are considering coming here wait for the fall or winter. I doubt you'll be back until prices are cheaper or if they make the premium price worth it. Just go to say you've gone.   I guess I'll see you in a few years when hopefully you're still here and you've improved."}
{"text":"I am torn on giving this 3 stars mainly because of the price as it was nearly 60 dollars for 2 adults and one child (one was free). The reason I will give it a 3 is because my daughters did enjoy it, but unless they add to the experience or adjust the price we wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! It's super expensive and the staff is NOT friendly!! $60 for 1 adult and 2 children's for 30 min and that's include 10 min for a movie!! Again worst experience ever!!! So disappointed ! I don't recommend it whatsoever !!!"}
{"text":"Quite honestly one of my favorite places in the world. The butterflies loved me and I had a couple cling to me for over an hour. The butterflies and plants are so beautiful. It was hard to leave."}
{"text":"I had the great pleasure of accompanying my mother to this exhibit on a recent trip to Scottsdale. I can tell you that the place is wonderful. We loved how they started with the video on the Monarch Butterfly. The atmosphere is both peaceful and breathtaking. A great place to visit by yourself or take the family to. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"An absolutely great time. Inside the butterfly atrium is like stepping into a dream. Thousands of butterflies of all shapes, colors and varieties flying around, some will even land on you. The movie was fantastic and the 3D effects were amazing. It was very informative and entertaining, great for kids and adults alike.   Before I went in I thought this would be a one time visit, but after touring the exhibit I considered upgrading to the annual pass. I decided against it, however I think I will make a return trip to Butterfly Wonderland."}
{"text":"I had a great time with my little one.  She asks to come here fairly often and I'm considering an annual pass."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful facility. The 3-D movie was interesting and enjoyable for the adults and the kids. Having been to the botanical garden's butterfly exhibit many times and never being that impressed, this setting had so much more to offer. We were allowed to stay in the butterfly area for almost 45 minutes, and we got to see and experience a wide variety of them while in the habitat. HOWEVER, the staff at this facility was grumpy and unpleasant. You would think that a business that caters to families and children would hire people that at least pretended to care about making the trip enjoyable... Especially for $13 per person. It is hard to enjoy any establishment when the people running it are pushy and obnoxious! Not one of them cracked a smile the entire time were there. From the guy running the movie who seemed to want to be anywhere else, to the woman guarding (yes... She is literally guarding it!) the sting ray exhibit, the staff there was sub par at best. After all is said and done, considering that the entrance fee for a family of 4 is over $50, we won't be returning.... No matter how pretty the wildlife is."}
{"text":"This place was the highlight of my vacation. I have never seen so many different types of butterfly's before and it was awesome walking around exploring the different ones and taking photos. I also loved that it wasn't all about butterflys that they also had a reptile section as well with snakes, frogs, alligators, monitors and more, and then also insects and tarantulas, they even had an aquatic area with fish and stingrays that you could feed (we didn't get to feed the stingrays tho cause they just got fed by other guests.) in addition to all of this they have a separate area right next to the butterfly place that is the aquatic center where you can explore different fish/wildlife. We wanted to buy tickets to go inside it but they were closing soon so we didn't get to explore much of that. but we did get to walk around the shopping center and go into different stores and found this ice bar that was pretty cool. Worth going for sure!"}
{"text":"Anyone know what's going on with the little trailer by parking? It says it's some ody-sea aquarium thing .. ? We've been here before. My 7 y/o boy loves it. Last time, there were no bees or ants. Now those are on display and I think he watched the bees go in and out for 20 m. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is bc I think it's a bit overpriced - as is the cafe."}
{"text":"2.5 review as this place just wasn't for me. I took my 21 month old daughter hoping that it would be something we could both enjoy. Being that it's summer in AZ, I wanted to avoid the zoo and figured this was a nice alternative. I was wrong. The atrium was grossly hot & humid. Maybe something to expect but I unfortunately didn't. It wasn't enjoyable, no matter how beautiful the butterflies are. My little girl loved it, but due to being scared that she would touch one (which is forbidden) I carried her the entire time. So if you come with kids who are hands-on, be expected to carry them.   I would say my biggest reason for only giving 2.5 stars was the admission price. It's way too much in comparison for the time you will spend. Two adults was over $40 while my daughter was free. We spent an hour there. So it was just not worth it and we won't be returning. Hopefully the aquarium they are building next door won't be as big of a disappointment."}
{"text":"Went with my three children as part of a homeschool field trip.  It cost just over $5 per person as part of the group.  We LOVED it!!  My kids did not want to go and were complaining.  Now they can't wait to go back again.  The 3D movie was very entertaining and we all learned quite a bit about monarch butterflies.  The display that has butterflies hatching out of their cocoon was my favorite part.  We got to watch 2 different butterflies hatch in the less than 10 minutes we were watching.  Kids had a fabulous time having butterflies land on them and taking pictures.  The scorpions and black light was fun.    Touching the sting rays was fun.  Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I wasn't sure what to expect. I found that I really enjoyed being able to get that close with the butterflies.  We took our teenage daughter who had a fantastic time because she is in to photography!  And not only the butterflies, the foliage is so well kept and makes for a beautiful environment."}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning!  First, you start with a cool and informative 3D movie...sets the stage for what beauty is about to come when you step into the butterfly atrium.  This place puts a smile on my face...you are surrounded by such beauty!  I have never seen so many butterflies and so many different kinds at that.  I took many photos, but they just didn't do it justice and it was hard to capture because the butterflies are moving so fast.    The entrance fee is pricey, but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Great new attraction here in Scottsdale, the 3D movie is great.  The atrium is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"If u have little ones this is a great place, but going as an adult its only worth a one time visit.  it was very expensive and we were only there an hour.  We added the mirror/laser thing and that was not worth the extra cost in my opinion.  All in all it was ok, but i did leave wondering where all those butterflies poop..."}
{"text":"Eh...it was OK. Brought my sons caregiver, my son (13) and myself...it was 58$!!! holy hella expensive!! My child has autism, so I wasn't sure what to expect from him with all the butterflies flapping about. We first saw the movie, which is good if you like 3-D stuff...but for me it just made me nauseated and gave me a bit of a headache. My son was NOT thrilled with the butterflies, and was shooing them away from him and trying to shoo them away with his foot too, so one of the workers got all in a tizzy about this...as if he was going to go kill the butterflies  or something...sheesh!!  While I was there I saw 4 people step on butterflies, and my son didn't even so much as graze against one....the guy clearly didn't understand the disability, or was just an ass...:(( the sting ray thing was ok as well, but not overly exciting...my son did seem to like that, but likely because he liked the fish in the tank, and water in general. Over all it was just Meh.....overpriced....WAY overpriced...I went, I saw....and now I don't think I will go again.....not until the other stuff is done in 2 years. This  is just MY experience...I'm sure others enjoyed it, but I didn't."}
{"text":"Great concept.  A great deal of thought went into the Atrium design and it flows nicely once you are in there spending quality time with the STUNNING collection of butterflies.  ** Note To Self:  Dress like a FLOWER next visit you get more butterfly dates **  Thank you for FREE entry on Mother's Day for Moms.  That was a pleasant surprise.  Ticket prices are MORE than fair and I would have happily paid to support the cause and keep my kids off the video games for several hours!  LOST1 STAR for poor crowd control, poor signage and generally ineffective human herd management.  Just a small tweak here and there will really improve overall efficiency on busy days.  GREAT PLACE TO GO - don't avoid it because its a little muddled when they huddle!"}
{"text":"It was a little on the expensive side, but we had a great experience. We went to the butterfly and aquarium portion and really enjoyed it.  There is also an outdoor area you can walk around, with live music and places to eat.  My 2 year old cannot stop talking about going back!"}
{"text":"Loved starting my new year with my fiance here at the exhibit. Really enjoyed the 3D movie experience. As well as the small aquarium section. For roughly $59 you can get a combo ticket deal for both the OdySea aquarium and butterfly exhibit both. If you live in the area, the same price buys an annual pass. Good deal IMO. You can pickup some neat souvenirs in the gift shop made by local craftsmen. I love my purple swallowtail butterfly ring. All products were made with naturally expired butterflies."}
{"text":"A vey cool place to visit in AZ. The science is great as is the 3-D movie. Best part is the butterfly exhibit - all sorts of colors and sizes. Many landed on us which my daughter was thrilled with."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I attended with 2 -10 year olds and a 14 year old and we had a great time! I am a local and embarrassed to say that we've not been here before and what a gem.  I really thought the 3D movie on Monarch's was a fantastic experience and we learned a lot, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the butterflies were just the icing on the cake.  If you have children that are 'squeamish' about bugs you might want to think twice about this outing.  We also paid extra for the mirror maze and laser tag and the girls loved that as well. Overall a great 2 hours out of the AZ heat. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Joy would sum it up.  Beautiful butterflies flying all around. Come for experience rather an expectation.  Four stars because it was fun, interesting, and unique.   Children love seeing the butterflies, photographers enjoy the easy access to great photo shots, most importantly this was a great place to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday."}
{"text":"Great experience for all ages. The Butterfly Wonderland allows you to get up close and personal with a massive variety of butterflies from around the world. They start off the tour with a beautiful video documentary regarding the life cycle of the Monarch butterfly. As you continue your journey through Butterfly Wonderland, you will never cease to be amazed at the newfound knowledge and appreciation you will have for this insect!"}
{"text":"Lifetime members do not get as much as they promise when you initially sign up. They do not have any birthday gift for anyone over the age of 12. Children under the age only receive a free cup of Dip N Dots. I suggest a 15% off discount in their cafe or in the shop. They also don't offer a large variety of food at the cafe. There are few extra activities for members to save substantially on and they charge a lot for the extra activities they DO offer. Overall, we enjoy attending, but I would never purchase a lifetime membership, if I could do all over again. Sea Odyssey is supposed to have a \"wine and cheese\" night for parents, many complimentary things for their lifetime members and their customer service is very kind."}
{"text":"Lovely little conservatory. My girls had a blast having butterflies all over them. The day we went was not busy at all, which we enjoyed."}
{"text":"The little kiddos had so much fun here, they did not want to leave the atrium.  Now, the 10 year old and older kids were done after an hour.  They sat around and watched the little ones have fun giggling as butterlies land on them.  You have to see the 3D show all about the butterflies and migration before they let you inside the atrium.  We went about a month ago, and it was hot and humid inside with just misters and fans to cool you off.  I am not sure how uncomfortable that gets in the height of the summer.  I will not ruin it for you.  It is worth going at least once to check out all the live beautiful lepidoptera."}
{"text":"Well I'm falling down on the job!  Thought for sure I had already posted my review.  This place is fantastic and the variety of butterflies and moths are amazing.  It can get quite crowded in here with visitors but you never really feel like you are elbow to elbow with anyone.  Kids love it here unless they are the squeamish type about bugs or things flying around them.  Stand still long enough and one will land on you which is fun.  They are just so beautiful.  There is an education center in there and a small snack area as well as the mandatory souvenir shop.  Even though the entry fee is steep (almost $20.00) it was worth it."}
{"text":"What a great experience.  One of the best attractions of the Valley. Young and old alike will enjoy their time in this beautiful oasis. Standing among thousands of beautiful butterflies flying around you was an overwhelming experience. Every where you look there is a photo op. The area with the fish was great.  We got to pet and feed the stingrays. The large tanks help fish from around the world. I recommed this for everyone."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience for all ages. A must see.  Don't miss out on this one. We love it so much that we've gone back about 5 times so far.  We also loved the Laser Maze and Mirror Maze next door."}
{"text":"What a unique experience for kids, not so much boys so thankfully I got a girl to share this with. Brand new state of the art facility, so I'm assuming thats what your paying for at the ticket counter. A bit pricey if you ask me but the gift shop was actually reasonable so thats a wash in my book.....  We were just in time to catch a 3D documentary on the flight & life of a monarch butterfly. I've seen this before on the tele but it was pretty cool in 3D. Then from there we went into this staging room before the atrium were we got to see several different types of butterflies emerging from their cocoons. Pretty cool! This place is great because there is no rush, it's all at your own speed. After watching butterflies break out of their cocoons we were off to the atrium. a butterfly haven. NO TOUCHING, NO PICKING UP but if they land on you thats ok. Hard for a little girl to grasp so I had to keep reminding her. Trust me when I say the butterfly keepers are on it too! The only thing I don't like about this experience is Summer, it was nice and toasty in there and the humidity was off the charts. From there tho you can cool down in the snack shop before you continue on.....  The next area is about insects & fish. Really good displays of both & a shallow tank with sting rays in them for petting. Not as spectacle as sea world but worth saving yourself a 5 hour drive over. You make your way thru the gift shop and after that your at the entrance/exit, round 2-sure, there's no time limit, how great!   My recommendations is try enjoying this place in better weather, you'll get your monies worth for sure being able to stay longer. Thank you who ever put this together, a great thing to have here in the valley. I will refer like mad!"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday. It was expensive for our group since we were a large group. The butterflies were beautiful and it was so cool getting to be so close to them. I would've liked there to be more info available about all the different butterflies that were there, or maybe the workers to be able to give a little more info than they did."}
{"text":"We had a great time! They start you off with an informative 15 minute 3D movie about the life of Butterflies. Then you go to the butterfly hatchery. I thought I was looking at dried up dead cocoons and then to my surprise I saw Live Butterflies emerging and then it turned exciting! The butterfly room is very magical. It's like it's storming butterflies. All kinds of butterflies! The butterflies are everywhere. You don't have to look for them. They look for you and land on you. You have to walk real slow and be careful not to step on butterflies because they also land on the ground by your feet. I would have spent more time in the butterfly room but it was very hot and very humid but it was enough for me. Afterwards you get to see some bonus fish and reptiles and then you walk out threw the gift shop. You can get a discounted ticket combined with OdySea.   We both enjoyed it more than we thought we would!"}
{"text":"Great time with 4 and 2 year old boys.  Would come back if the prices weren't so high.  Coupons barely put a dent in it.  Beautiful experience though."}
{"text":"Great, fun place. I took my daughter here and she loved it. Had an amazing time. The 3D movie was great, don't skip it, it's really great!!! My daughter had a lot of butterflies land on her, that really made her day.  We will be back. We also got to touch stingrays. I know they are expanding, that will be excitng when completed. Thinking of doing the membership."}
{"text":"Here is my response to butterfly wonderland:  I would think some retraining the retail staff would be in order. I understand I didn't have my receipt in the bathroom when I was in the middle of washing my daughters hands and the ball. I would appreciate more an apology from said staff who accused me publicly of stealing in front of other ladies in the bathroom to myself and my daughter in front of all the retail staff. I was not informed I needed my receipt and the staff who I bought my ball from didn't inform me as I signed my credit card receipt before leaving the gift shop with my daughter to go back into the exhibit. If that is policy wouldn't that staff tell me that as I'm signing my receipt or offer me a bag which she didn't. The staff whom I bought it from had time while I signed my receipt to tell me these things which she definitely didn't tell me I needed my receipt with a purchase especially without a bag if that is your policy? Some retraining about that may be helpful to avoid another situation like this. The staff who tried to chase me down into the bathroom should have checked with other staff. Most people who are stealing something don't go further into an building and not one without an exit. She publicly and purposely humiliated me in front of others when she was in the wrong and then didn't even come to apologize I had to seek her and the staff who I bought the ball from apologized to me first. I don't care to utilize my hard earned money at your place and I would reconsider if I felt validity of your staff's retraining on what to say to someone which isn't accusing them of stealing, that once your staff found out from the staff whom I bought the ball from she should have seeked me out and apologized profusely. But no she waited for me to come find her and ask if she had talked to the staff and have that staff whom I bought the ball from apologize first and then her apology which was Muttered. It's things like that which may need to be discussed with all retail staff and an public apology from your staff to me and my daughter would help me feel better about those situation and want to recommend this place to others. But as it is now I will not be back and I will be glad to not recommend it to others because of your retail staff. I am continuing to email anyone higher up about my experience in the retail part of the butterfly wonderland"}
{"text":"We wanted to do something fun and mostly flat since someone in our party was in a wheelchair. When I looked at a previous review they talked about expensive the food was so decided to eat prior to our arrival. They offer different price points for different packages of things to do. I'm not sure a folding should be housed, never the less in the desert so we did the butterfly  exhibit  for our party and my daughter and I did the mirror maze and laser game. We entered a theater and were shown a portion of a 3D movie about monarch butterfly. We the were taken to see some butterfly cocoons and the through to the exhibit. It's humid in there for the butterflies and boy there were a ton. A coy pond is also here along with some birds. Also a honey bee area. It was a beautiful area and defiantly worth the time spent walking around. Best thing is to just sit and watch all the colors flying around and hope one will land on you."}
{"text":"I was relieved to love every minute of this, even the movie with scoffing idiots behind me and overly perfumed grandmas in front of me, because I knew that if I didn't feel psychotic joy at a butterfly wonderland I'd have to accept myself as irreparably jaded.  The chrysalis/cocoon room was like slow-motion Christmas; I could have never moved on to the atrium and still been absolutely psyched about what I got to see. Those metallic chrysalises! Enormous moths with wingtips that mimic snake heads!  BUT THEN I WENT INTO THE ATRIUM. Raining butterflies. Bright blue giants swooping around your legs, reds and greens and lavenders alighting on trees and fruits, and completely charming attempts by the occasional lady butterfly to deposit eggs on an unsuspecting-but-enchanted guest. I was worried about the humidity beforehand, but it was the last thing on my mind when I got in there with my camera and transformed into an excitable eight-year-old.  The best part of the 3D monarch film was the little kid next to me who kept reaching out to grab the butterflies. The best part of the non-butterfly exhibits was the UV-fluorescing scorpions.  Wishlist:  1. A viewing room for feeding caterpillars, to complete the progression of the life cycle. Sounds like they currently ship pupated stock to the facility rather than rear on-site; one hopes these are not collected from the wild.  2. Instrumental music or recordings of rainforest noise in place of horrifying Small World-style tunes and hippie serenades.  Ultimately, the day I visited Butterfly Wonderland was the day a blue Morpho landed on my head, and that was all I ever really wanted."}
{"text":"Have been twice - would recommend it as a family outing. One tip - go in the winter/cooler months, and stay away during peak summer temps. Also, wear red (or other bright colors?) - red seemed to be a great draw to the butterflies, and several landed on me, but not others in our group wearing more muted colors.  Tickets are a little pricey - $42 for 2 adults (1.5 yr old was free). Amazingly, our 1.5 yr old sat through the movie perfectly, without wearing the 3D glasses. The atrium was super humid and a bit uncomfortable, but to be expected on a day where it was 115 out. During our first visit earlier this year, it was perfect temps inside the atrium - even with a (red!) sweater on."}
{"text":"What a place!  Expensive (2 Seniors, 1 adult, 1 student ran $80).  We didn't buy the add-on ticket for the Maze, but the main museum was wonderful.  First, the 3-D intro movie was really good!  Excellent 3-D and a fine intro to the world of butterflys.    After the movie, you are sent into the next room a few people at a time.  This is the room where you actually see butterflys as they develop and are :born.\"  The room is too small for even 25 people to be able to see the live progression and there was no one explaining what we were seeing.  The trip from the movie to the rain forest needs improvement.  The high point was entering the rain forest type room and being right next to thousands of beautiful creatures. (Be sure to take your camera).  Plenty of places to sit and watch.  Especially watch the children as the butterflys actual light on them (wear red - red seems to attract them).  We spent 30 minutes there and could have spent a lot more time.  The neat thing is there are sooo many breeds (?), so the colors are really spectacular.  If it weren't for this room, it would be a 2 or 3 star.  The next two portions - not much.  The bee exhibit and the ant exhibit were very small, almost like a afterthought, poorly explained and again, no one to explain or answer questions."}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience. Go for the butterflies and don't expect much else in terms of entertainment.   When we entered we were given no explanation as to what was to happen. (No \"Go right this way folks!\") No general instructions, nothing. I assumed we could walk around and see various exhibits. First, guests are escorted to a movie theater. We were lucky and got there early so didn't have to wait in a long line. The movie was just long enough to be interesting and learn new things and short enough so pre-schoolers wouldn't get bored. It was actually a very nicely done 3D film.  Next you can view the chrysalis dangling but have to wait to get outdoors to see the main attraction...the rainforest with butterflies! Our wait wasn't long because of the time we arrived.  The best part of this place is of course seeing all the gorgeous butterflies flit around the outdoor rainforest. We spent most of our time there.  There are some great photo opportunities and everyone seemed to be enjoying it from the toddler set to grandparents. We didn't leave until each one of us had a butterfly land on us. Great fun!   Next we saw the smallish ant exhibit, and the bee exhibit. Both are pretty low-key. My grandson liked the scorpion tank where he could see them glow with a florescent light. Cool!  There is a stingray installation but you can skip it if you've been to wonderful aquariums like Monterey Bay Aquarium.  All-in-all, we spent a couple of hours there. It's not cheap..by no means. For 3 adults and a pre-schooler, it was around $73.   I would take guests there again. It is unique enough to spend the $$ again."}
{"text":"Butterfly Wonderland provides a fun experience for kids of all ages! Trust me, as a big kid I enjoyed it and my four month old enjoyed it too! It's much more impressive than it appears from the outside and it looks like the area is only going to get more exciting next summer with the expansion. Butterfly Wonderland captures the true beauty of the butterfly. I didn't quite realize how fascinating the beautiful winged creatures were until I saw the movie they play when you arrive. Learning about their journey and how unique a Monarch butterfly actually is made it all the more exciting to step into the butterfly exhibit.   Butterfly Wonderland consists of a movie theater, rainforest filled with butterflies, a miniature aquarium and a bug exhibit. Most importantly, it's all indoors which means you can enjoy it all year long. I never saw such beautiful butterflies before visiting Butterfly Wonderland. I saw electric blue butterflies, bright orange ones and plenty of beautiful Monarch butterflies. Before entering, there is an entire room filled with cocoons and if you're lucky, you'll witness the birth a butterfly during your visit.   This is worth the price of admission and it's a lovely experience for a family. I can't wait for the expansion to open in Summer of 2016 (an aquarium, ferris wheel, dolphin experience and merry-go-round) just to name a few!   Alongside Butterfly Wonderland is a laser maze which I didn't do but it also looks pretty fun!"}
{"text":"My family of 4 (3 and 5 yr old) wanted to love this place, but it was a waste of money!!!  We want our $60 back!! First of all, they claim to have the largest conservatory in America.  Yes, by blueprint this may be true, but when you walk in it does not look like a rainforest in anyway and you only see one or two types of butterflies.  Please make way to Houston's butterfly conservatory (Texas).  That is a real rainforest carrying all kinda of butterflies from around the world.  Also, there was no information to be found on walls about anything you saw.  They give these cards to the children to ask a volunteer for a \"fun fact\" and we only passed 2 volunteers! There was no one available to tell you what you were looking at.  No signage of explanations of any sort.  How is this educational? Please please do not waste your money.  You are better off watching YouTube videos or going to the library for information. Also, they had ants and bees.  Same thing no descriptions.  We walk into this tiny aquarium with maybe 3 fish tanks with 2 fish in them.  We saw one lady who asked if we were going to do some petting.. Um ok and proceeds to give us hand sanitizer. First of all what are we petting?? We put our hands in the water to pet what looks like a stingray??? No signage??!!! No one is there to tell us anything!!! So disappointing.. Again, why is this educational? The fish in the tank has a white piece of paper on the wall that looked like they had just printed it earlier that morning with the name of the fish.  That's it!! No other information about where the fish is from.. Nothing.  My husband made a comment.. Hey we eat that fish.  You can get that at the Asian market. Lol oh and when we waited to see the movie, a man came in and had to read off a piece of paper his welcome message which had nothing to do with the movie.  just about where the exits were.  Lol nothing to see here.  The only cool thing my kids got was a butterfly and caterpillar balloon that was not made by them (Willie's creations) because it was the grand opening weekend.  Also, the 3d flight of the butterflies movie was great for the kids, but not worth $60. I don't think so.  Save your money and go to desert botanical.  At least there are people who can give you information. Oh and need to add... It took us 35 min (not including movie) to see everything.  We had planned for this to be at least a 2 hr adventure for the price we were paying!!"}
{"text":"Hood place to spend sometime with kids. Something unique among the places i ve been to"}
{"text":"as a short little birthday treat for my butterfly obsessed lady, we went on a little tour of this relatively new item in scottsdale.   i found it strange when they were building it, out in the desert, in a non-descript parcel of land off the 101, why anyone would build a butterfly sanctuary in arizona, land of 120 degree summer temps?  well they did, and it was only a matter of time before we would go.   we bought tix online and good thing we did because the ticket lines were super long. we were able to get in quickly, get our stamp and wait for about 5 minutes for the \"flight of the monarch\" 3-D movie. it's a neat little show about the monarchs, but we had more than a few screaming kids in the audience for the 15 minute show.   on to the chrysalis, or butterfly nursery exhibit. that was really neat to see real live butterfly's being \"born\". there is an ant, bee, small aquarium exhibit, and desert insect exhibit, but the real fun starts in the butterfly exhibit.   tip: wear bright clothes and you're likely to get a few of these delicately beautiful insects to land on you!  there were hundreds of absolutely magical butterfly's floating around. their colors and the closeness as to which you could approach them was truly amazing. they are bugs and only live 2 weeks, but it's still very neat to see them up close and be awed how pretty they are.   weekends are probably packed, but on this sunday around 11am, it wasn't too bad. all the staff were super friendly and the price is decent for an hour or 2!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness did we enjoy ourselves or what, being that it was Valentine's Day it was very busy lots of children & adults alike.  The price is reasonable $19.95 for adults & $12.95 for children  Pros & cons   Con :  long lines Lines can be long!!! I got a bit anxious because I couldn't wait to see the butterflies, they recommend you see a 3D 15 min movie about the life of the monarch butterfly I didn't want to but so glad we did !!! Best 3D I've ever seen so cool and realistic.   Con : very humid in the atrium, ladies if you go expect the hair to go flat in 0 to 20 seconds so use a high humidity hair spray.   Con : parking overflow !!!  Pros : Butterflies butterflies butterflies everywhere? They land on you and just hang out like little buddies, it's a ticklish feeling.  They can touch you but you can't touch them.    Pros : amazing photos everywhere you turn   Pros : clean restrooms, friendly staff overall fun experience   It's fun for all ages if you've never been you should totally go   Enjoy the butterfly kisses that they give you   anyone desires a wish to come true they must first capture a butterfly and whisper their wish to it. Since a butterfly can make no sound, the butterfly can not reveal the wish to anyone but the Great Spirit who hears and sees all.  In gratitude for giving the beautiful butterfly its freedom, the Great Spirit always grants the wish. So, according to legend, by making a wish and giving the butterfly its freedom, the wish will be taken to the heavens and be granted."}
{"text":"The Monarch film was very informative and the 3D feature made you feel like you were there! The vast number of chrysalis varieties was fascinating! Some looked like sleeping bats. Some like seed pods. And some like liquid gold! So pretty! We enjoyed the garden where the butterflies fly free. Fun when they land on you! There were many signs throughout the facility that talked about conservation. So I was extremely disappointed to discover there are no recycling bins anywhere inside or out! Seems very contradictory for them to encourage us as visitors to be eco-friendly, and yet not offer bins to get rid of any recycling!"}
{"text":"Being thus far child free, I'm not sure Butterfly Wonderland was really worth it on a crowded Saturday.  At $41 for two full adult admissions, you might be better suited attending and a quiet Tuesday when you can really stand around staring for awhile.   The Wonderland begins w/ a 3D movie which is light on science, heavy on emotional pull (especially for those kiddies), and occasionally sprinkled w/ unexpected but welcome warnings about butterfly habit destruction.  Not sure there was a single real butterfly in the whole movie, but the 3D effect are actually somewhat stunning, even if they are a bit blurry, sometimes.  The small hatchery, obviously only a portion of the location's incubation activities is still sort of lovely to look at: Chrysalides are varied and range from sparkly and golden to horrific and alien.    Butterfly room gets to be a bit much after 20 or so minutes.  Obvious word of warning:  You will be wet. And sometimes blind, as steam is continually pouring into the environment to keep things a little bit tropical.  Butterflies are everywhere, so uncontrollable children might prove lethal and are better left stomping around at home.    But, there are butterflies! You're not allowed to taunt or beckon, but sometimes you're lucky enough to be a safe haven for a big blue winged thing for a couple of seconds.    Butterfly Wonderland also includes some ant and bee colonies as well as a small underwhelming aquarium and sting ray tank (All the rage these days, poor string rays.  The tank at World Wildlife Zoo in Surprise still reigns supreme, in terms of number and charming hunger of the rays).   A cafe sells something or other.  Low grade and over priced, if it matches other museum/zoo food options.  Gift shop full of gift shop type stuff.  Entire location is flat (except for one raised and ramped section of the Butterfly room) so wheelchairs are definitely welcome."}
{"text":"Outstanding for young and old. Beautiful butterflies and great venue to get close and interact."}
{"text":"Wow! A unique and remarkably beautiful environment one must experience in AZ. I took my toddler and it wasn't the right fit for the cost and the time that she was entertained. Great activity for older kids and adults though!"}
{"text":"Fun to go through with kids or if you love butterflies!  I recommend watching the videos, very informative.  The highlight of course is the butterfly encounter, all sorts of beautiful butterflies and moths!  Doesn't take long to go through, around an hour!  Keep in mind the encounter is very humid, and your hair will feel it!!"}
{"text":"Be advised. Must love butterflies. It's 20 bucks to get to walk thorough a butterfly Sanctuary. The sanctuary wad kinda cool..but the placee is crazy disorganized and a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Love this place! There is a 3D movie, that I found educational.  Be advised the atrium where the butterflies fly around freely is humid, but after all; how else would you expect rain forest weather to be like. This place is great for all ages, also they have an amazing gift shop."}
{"text":"Was debating whether or not I wanted to spend $20 to see butterflies for a while, but on Sunday I decided to go for it! While I still think tickets were too pricey, it was worth it for a one time thing. The 3D movie made me dizzy and that usually doesn't happen, so beware of that! But it was informational, and kept my attention. The area with the cocoons was interesting too. The atrium was less humid than anticipated which was good! It was very pretty in there with all the plants and butterflies. None landed on me, sadly. It was a little smaller than I had expected though. We also checked out the small portion of the aquarium that is open and it was cool! Just one room of fish and a sting ray touch pool. Though we couldn't touch any of the stingrays, they wouldn't come up to us haha. But I liked it and it got me pumped for the full aquarium to open next year!"}
{"text":"Do you like butterflies?    Do you like them enough to spend $20 or so per head to see them?  If the answer is yes, I suggest going during the 8 months of the year that are not summer.  They \"said\" it would be around 80 degrees / 80% humidity inside the butterfly area - there's no way it was cooler than 90 in there and yes, the humidity was ridiculous.  The 3D film they show is interesting (migration of the monarch) - and the staff is helpful / nice enough, but it was just so dang expensive.  I went with my three year old niece, and she did get a kick out of it, but certainly not something I'll go back to on purpose.  I understand it's expensive to import all the pupae - and there were certainly some exotic and beautiful things to see, but for the price I honestly expected to be wowed more.    In summation, don't go between June and September and check online for coupons / discounts before showing up to ease the sting of the cost."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! My mother loved it for Mother's Day! I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun date or just a fun day out with the family."}
{"text":"The kiddies loved it! Pricey but worth it because got to see a large variety of species of butterflies and a few of the butterflies actually hatching. Seeing a huge atlas Moth was pretty neat too.  Highly recommend it for families."}
{"text":"What a great time being surrounded by thousands of butterflies. They give you a whole history on the stages of butterflies and it's pretty interesting. They also have some aquariums and desert creatures.  When in Scottsdale this is a great place to take the kids.  Also have the aquarium next door which is not as neat but still worth a visit."}
{"text":"Butterfly Wonderland is something you should do at least once when you're in Arizona, whether you are a tourist or a local. From the moment you walk in you are greeted by friendly faces and you get a photo taken (not worth the money) on a green screen, later butterflies are edited in. As you're being walked back to a small movie theater to start your educational journey, you'll notice on the walls rare butterflies enclosed in glass frames for display. You receive a pair of fashionable 3D glasses. A movie plays on the screen where you follow a young butterfly in its lifetime. I haven't seen a movie in 3D in a long time and I was definitely impressed with how high the quality was, I felt like I was in it. After the movie is done, you walk out into a room to get to the atrium where you are greeted by a staff member. Once everyone is in the room, the staff member explains a couple of rules in order for us to keep the butterflies safe. As the door slowly opens, it feels like you are walking into a dream. You are instantly greeted by colorful butterflies. The atrium is decked out head to toe in lush and full greenery. Watch your step though! These little friends may land on the ground. The Atrium is equipped with clear pathways for wheelchairs, koi pond, and a big butterfly chair to get your picture. This is where you will be spending a majority of your time (highlight/main attraction). You will get plenty of photos with exotic butterflies landing on your shoulder and even in your hair! Mind you, you can come in and out of the atrium as much as you want. Exiting to the next portion you're going to have to check to see if anyone hitched a ride in front of a big mirror. You don't want to take them home with you! Next you'll see some of the common desert creepy crawlies, ranging from scorpions which you can light up with black lights. Tarantulas, Ants, and even Bees! You can see the bees making honey right in front of you. The last part is probably the most unique, it's an AQUARIUM! It even has a stingray interaction where they will swim up and glide over your fingers. There is many other assortments of interesting looking marine life surrounding the stingray tub. Sadly we did not attend the maze next door because of the overpriced charge. Ending the journey you walk thru the gift shop where you are able to purchase fun souvenirs and knick-knacks, also that is where you may purchase your overpriced photo. I hope that this has enticed you to experience what I have. Keep an eye out for the OdySea In The Desert, which is being built next door by 2016!"}
{"text":"expensive, doesn't last a long time and they charged me twice. so, i suggest going out in nature & seeing them instead of $20 a person"}
{"text":"The movie about the migration of the Monarch was great.  Being in the room with butterflies all around was really mystifying and beautiful.  The only downside is that it is a little pricey, but being that we were on our honeymoon, we were willing to pay."}
{"text":"Six words  Get up early in the morning  The butterflies go crazy here at sun rise.  They have new features since they first opened. The 3D movie is great. The outdoor couches seem impossible to sit on during the summer.  Maybe they should invest in misters."}
{"text":"Entry for an adult with tax is about $21, a child is about $13. For the price you experience a ten minute 3-D movie. That is followed by a visit to the atrium. It is very lovely ,however ,even at a leisurely pace you are through in about 10 minutes. Be prepared to have butterflies Dive-bomb your head and land all over you. You must also be careful not to step on the butterflies. This is followed by a room with a few aquarium tanks Where children are given the opportunity to touch stingrays. Just be aware that the whole tour takes an hour max and would quickly bore children."}
{"text":"I was not sure what to expect here but I'm so glad we went!  It was amazing!!  Educational (but surely not boring) and incredible to walk amongst all the butterflies.  Absolutely beautiful, peaceful and awe inspiring.  Our 24 year old son even loved it!  The movie shown at the beginning is great to help understand what you are seeing in the butterfly garden.  I'm not sure why some complain about the price.  We were there for 3 hours so $20 for 3 hours of entertainment is well worth it!  And, the cost to maintain all the butterflies from around the world justifies the admission fee.  I highly recommend an outing to Butterfly Wonderland while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I admit it. I was prepared to not be impressed, but I was and I really enjoyed it. It's expensive and honestly I can't see spending more than one hour maybe two. The 3D movie is wonderful. The atrium is lovely, so many butterflies flying around, landing on you. I felt like I was in another country. While my kids liked it, we discovered my 3 y/o  is terrified of butterflies, hehe.  Definitely go first thing in the morning: less crowded and not as hot. Like someone mentioned, it's a place to go at least once."}
{"text":"We loved our time here. The movie was very informative and makes you want to build a butterfly garden! There's no rush while your here, just take your time and walk about all the different varieties of butterflies. Sit a bit and just watch them. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"\"Butterflies! Butterflies! Butterflies!\"  Butterflies are pretty much all my toddler would talk about today after our visit to Butterfly Wonderland.  I didn't really have expectations going in to check this place out; I only knew that they were newly opened and had lots of butterflies and a 3D butterfly movie.    I went with Alexa M (my sister-in-law) and my two kids (both under 2).  Luckily the kids were free because my adult ticket was $18.95 and Alexa's student ticket was $16.95... kind of pricey for what it is!  We found all of the employees very friendly -- especially Myrna who took our tickets and gave us our 3D glasses upon entering.  She even gave my son an extra butterfly stamp on his hand since he's kind of obsessed with both stamps and butterflies!  And while he wouldn't sit still for the movie, he absolutely loved seeing the butterflies in the atrium despite the humidity.  He also loved the fountain and fish (both indoors and out).  The cafe and gift shop were satisfactory but overpriced.  Even so, this is a fun place to visit with the kids or without.  If you're looking for an activity to eat up an hour or two max, and you have some extra $$ to spend, I do recommend this place... We actually ended up getting annual passes since my son liked it so much."}
{"text":"Great for kids, great for those wanting to spend $70 to see butterflies.  Serious -$70 - butterflies.  Pro tip - www.google.com then images - type butterflies.  You are welcome."}
{"text":"Quite enjoyable.  Took my great niece and she  it.  As always spring break is a tough time visiting any attraction, anywhere."}
{"text":"My family and I are lifetime members of Butterfly Wonderland, and I cannot say enough great things about this place. It is a place where you can have an educational and fun time, and it is great for all ages. We have seen it really grow within the past few years, they keep adding more and more. So, if you went a few years ago and haven't been there lately, I highly recommend a return visit. The conservatory is amazing. The butterflies are gorgeous, the koi pond is so peaceful, and the reptiles are really interesting to observe as well. Love it so much!"}
{"text":"Liked this one a lot especially when visiting with family and friends. Lots of great pictures. They definitely have the marketing concepts down for maximum capitalization but nothing offending.  Would visit again. Great for a young family or gparents but not a repeat performance for an annual pass."}
{"text":"We went to BW on a Saturday afternoon and expected it to be packed- luckily it was busy but the traffic flow of BW was very well orchestrated. When you first come into BW you go into a small theater and watch a really cool 3D movie. Probably one of the best 3D movies I have ever seen. The movie is about 15 mins long. From there you go into a room where you can see butterflies at all different stages of coming out of their chrysalis's. Then, from there- into the atrium. Now, this is advertised as \"America's Largest Butterfly Atrium\". Is it really? Eh. I saw a previous review that complained that it was hot and humid in there....duh- it has to be. Come prepared for that. With that said, I wouldnt recommend coming in July/August. But you can walk around the atrium as long as you want and it is truly beautiful to see all the butterflies fluttering around. I was hoping to see more varieties of butterflies, but it was still pretty cool.   After the atrium you can go in and check out the bees, ants, fish, and stingrays. This is all pretty new and it shows- if you have seem the sting rays at the Phoenix Zoo- dont waste your time with the stingrays at BW. Finally- you go into the gift shop. Prices were reasonable. It would be great if they could eventually sell the honey fromt he bees.   Last, is the \"Mirror Maze\" and \"Laser Maze\" area. This is so obviously an after thought and I was HIGHLY disappointed in the staff in this area. We had never been here before and the staff did not explain how to do the laser maze to my 7 and 9 year old kids. The girl running the laser maze just said to them, \"Okay, go in.\" But the laser maze has 3 stops the kids need to check in at to complete the maze. However, I wasnt actually surprised by the poor customer service here because it was the general theme throughout BW.   Bottom Line: For the $20/person admission- this place needs to seriously invest in quality staff. Yes, the butterflies are pretty and this place has potential to be a wonderful gem- but they have got to realize that people are paying for an experience. Not a single employee we interacted with was smiling nor were they helpful in anyway, shape, or form. They could be walking around sharing facts about the butterflies, stingrays, fish, etc...instead they only bark orders to not touch and to let them take the butterflies off you."}
{"text":"A very fun trip for the whole family. The movie portion is a little long if you have VERY young kids but the butterfly part is fantastic. ITs very hot and humid so be prepared for your hair to frizz and leave dripping wet. WE will probably save this activity for the winter time, not the AZ Summers."}
{"text":"This morning (Tuesday) was our first time visiting the Butterfly Wonderland.  It took 45 minutes of waiting in line to get in (there were numerous school groups that took priority over the general public). I would call before going to see how many field trips the Butterfly Wonderland is hosting, and at what times, so you can avoid the frustration."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take kids on a field trip or outing.  The kids really enjoyed the 3D movie about a Monarchs' life cycle, getting to explore in the atrium and interacting with the sting rays.  I'm glad I went as part of a field trip b/c I feel the admission price is a bit much for such a short tour.  The food selections in the snack bar were sparse and a bit pricey.  There are several fast food places/restaurants on the next exit over (Indian Bend).  If it were cheaper, or they offered a local discount I would bring many guests here."}
{"text":"Butterfly Wonderland owes my visit to Yelp.  I was scrolling through Yelp and I saw the pictures of previous Yelper's visits, so I wanted to check it out.  BUTTERFLY WONDERLAND  Butterfly Wonderland is the largest butterfly conservatory in America.   It features an indoor conservatory that brings a tropical rainforest environment to Arizona where thousands of butterflies fly freely.  Butterfly Wonderland is located at OdySea in the Desert, a 35-acre entertainment destination that features 3 live animal attractions - OdySea Aquarium, Butterfly Wonderland, and Dolphinaris.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE   Butterfly Wonderland on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community reservation, just east of the 101 Freeway at the Via Ventura exit.  The main ticket window sells the tickets for both OdySea and Butterfly Wonderland.   They offer packages for both the Butterfly Wonderland and OdySea. For just the pass to the Butterfly Wonderland, it was $24+tax.  The main entrance was cute, just NOT a \"WOW\" factor for that price.  Immediately after I went through the ticket gate, they tried to usher me into their 3D theater for a 15 minute show, which is practically mandatory before they allow people to go to see the butterflies, but it was filled with families with children, and that's just not my scene, so I opted out, and went straight into the butterfly room.  The butterfly room is one big room that looks like a mini copy of a tropical forest, obviously filled with butterflies.  The staff gave me some helpful instructions, and was available throughout the exhibit. They also set some fresh fruit out from time to time, which invigorates the butterflies, so they're easier to see. I liked that part a lot. It brought out some butterflies that I wasn't able to see on my own.  The butterfly space is pleasant and pretty. The butterflies are really fun. I had one butterfly sit on me for a half hour. I don't know what makes that awesome, but it really was a good time.  There is a small snack shop which was overpriced and had minimal crap and sodas.  There is a reptile exhibit and tropical fish aquariums that was interesting.  There is also a gift shop with overpriced tchotchkes.  CONCLUSION   I love taking photos, and it's a good place to get a few pictures with some pretty subjects in a nice environment.  I liked the experience, but it's not worth the money to keep coming back.  4/5 RECOMMEND  *Discount packages available.  *Available for group events.  *Plenty of parking out front.  *For more information: butterflywonderland.com"}
{"text":"My friend and I have wanted to go to the Butterfly Wonderland for a while and the time came to go! We met up on a Sunday morning and got our ticket to check them out!    What does Butterfly Wonderland got going for them? Well they are the only butterfly atrium in the valley and they say they are America's largest butterfly atrium too. , they say the butterflies inside the conservatory come from butterfly farmers from Costa Rica, Malaysia, Ecuador, Thailand & the Philippines as well as within the US and another fun fact Arizona is home to 344 species of butterflies.  Here comes the sticker shock: its 18.95 plus tax which equals to 20.26 I think it was.    Once you pay your ticket you walk inside and have to wait in a hallway because you will be directed to watch a 14 minute movie on the migration of the Monarch Butterfly in 3D, we had to wait a few minutes because there was a show already playing.  The movie is cool; you follow a year in the life of a few Monarchs.   Once your movie is over you are shown into the conservatory, now this is where the fun is it, so many amazing beautifies fluttering around, some look like they are in a game of tag, some just seeing what everyone else is up to, if you stand still and make small movements you might be blessed to have a few land on you, also was told if you wear bright colors they will be attracted to you too, You are not allowed to hold out your hand or try to touch them, but they are allowed to land on you.  I had a few land on me and also had a few fly too close to my face and gave me a butterfly smack or too! Haha  I could spend hours in the conservatory just watching the butterflies enjoying the sun light.  A few things, the conservatory is a tropical rain forest, its humid and misting water is happening, so dress for the rain forest, leave your bags & purses in the car, no need for all that, watch where you are walking the butterflies land everywhere and just make sure you don't step on them. Also inside the conservatory you will see a Koi fish pond, I thought that was cool but also thought hey don't they eat bugs that might land on the water,aawwee poor butterflies that became fish food .  Once you leave the conservatory you go into a smaller room and check to see if you are smuggling any butterflies, and I know that sounds funny, but there were a few that tried to escape before we went through the door.   Then you get to check a cool ant farm, some fishes and other stuff, and even stick your hand in a tank to touch a sting ray, and yes I did that, but I have fed sting rays before too, it's a cool experience.  This was an enjoyable time, we spent maybe 2 hours enjoying everything, do I feel its worth the 20 buck entry fee, no I don't, but will I be a sucka and do it again yep I will haha."}
{"text":"What a unique experience for couples, family's and individuals to part take in! I have always wanted to check this place out, and my husband secretly planned our anniversary date here. He had purchased the tickets in advance online, which I think was a good idea as we were able to skip the lines and walk right in.   The entryway was very well lit and had a lovely collection of butterfly artwork to look at, which I appreciated while waiting for the first butterfly wonderland experience. Shortly after entering the entrance a host has you enter a theatre room to watch a 3D educational movie that only last 15 mins. The movie itself was quite appealing  After that, they systematically have you leave that room and into another to see many windows full of different moth and butterfly cocoons. Someone is there to answer any questions you have, and we even got the pleasure of seeing 2 butterflies hatch from their cocoons-so cool!!  Next, you are escorted or shuffled into the atrium-groups at a time. Hold your breath, it's that gorgeous!! There were even a couples of string violinist dressed in their tuxes playing to the symphony of the butterflies fluttering about. There are more butterflies to watch, than you can imagine. They land, anywhere and we're very sweet to watch.   This is a memory I will forever hold dear to me!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love butterflies . This place was amazing. So many beautiful butterflies. I was impressed with how many this exhibit had. The set up and grounds were so pretty. It is also a very peaceful sanction to be at. You can relax here and take in the beautiful gardens. I was checking this place out for a school field trip. It is very educational for everyone. Plus the gift shop is amazing. I loved the large selection of Eric Carle products. (The very hungry caterpillar) this is a wonderful place to visit in Arizona."}
{"text":"Welcome to a beautiful land of butterflies! Be prepared to relax and watch a 3D movie of a butterfly names in \"Dana!\" Then into the live room of butterflies. Also, there is an exhibit free of admission into an aquarium room that has a love sting rat you can pet :) we had a tranquil time and loved it!"}
{"text":"Been there twice w/ friends and little kids 2, 4, 6, and 9. We all had a great time and it was just what we needed.   The movie is short at 15 mins which is good since kids = short attention span! 3D made it even better. The small room w/ the glass where new bf's and moths are born- nice palette cleanser between main atractions. The real star is the big room. If a butterfly actually lands on the kids it makes it even more special.   Stingray pool and aquarium were a nice variant, as was gift shop even, I bought them each a little something.  I don't think it's pricey for what you get. Seeing the kids eyes light up - and sharing the experience about something completely outside the normal box of sporting events or video games - to see them enjoy a unique experience w/ nature - was so worth it."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I had my doubts going into Butterfly Wonderland. It's not that I don't like butterflies, but I don't love them either - I guess I would say I'm indifferent and just never gave them much attention.   I had family visiting and I decided to go because of the raving reviews on Yelp; and quite frankly I am shocked it was as fun as it was!   For starters, they have more than just butterflies - they have some fish, snakes, scorpions and lizards as well. The people here are very passionate about their butterflies, and know a lot of really interesting facts.   The visit starts off with a 3D movie, which turned out to be wonderful - it was a great story and the 3D really adds to the experience.  After you finish the 3D movie, you are then sent through double doors (can't have any butterflies escaping) to a butterfly paradise. The butterfly paradise is full of everything a butterfly could ever want: fruit, beautiful bright flowers, a nice humid and warm environment (but not too hot), water features, etc.   The biggest issue I have is trying to avoid the butterflies! Yes, you actually need to be very careful of your surroundings. As big as humans might be, butterflies do not appear to have any fear of us and do try to land in your foot path. Butterflies also try to and will land on you, I myself had one land on my back during the visit.   Take your time, enjoy the beautiful plants and butterflies and DO bring a camera. Price was certainly reasonable for the enjoyment level."}
{"text":"Hubby and I brought our 15 month old granddaughter here last weekend and had a really good time. You start off watching a movie (with 3-D glasses) that explains the lifecycle of butterflies and then move on to an outdoor atrium where you get to get up close and personal with lots of them. If you are lucky you will even have them land on you like one did on me! Be prepared however as it does get warm and humid in the atrium! Also, strollers are not allowed in the atrium and the area where you park your stroller is very cramped. After the atrium there is a small collection of sea life (fish, eels, rays, etc.), insects (cockroaches, beetles, etc.), and reptiles (snakes, lizards, turtles, etc.) for you to enjoy They do have a snack bar inside  however we did not look at what they offered as we had already eaten. And then of course there is the requisite gift shop upon leaving that has a nice variety of items for both young and old alike. We enjoyed it and so did our granddaughter even though she is only 15 months. We can't wait to take her when she is older!"}
{"text":"This is my first time ever going to a butterfly atrium.  This place is definitely a must do for kids (and curious adults) if you're in the area.  They start off with an informative 3D video, then you get to see different types butterflies in their different stages depending on the season you visit.  The atrium was amazing!! In addition they had a few small aquariums, an ant farm, a bee hive and a small pool where you can touch rays"}
{"text":"I love this experience. I moved to Az in November 2016. I purchased an annual pass last spring.  I have been 4 times and still enjoy seeing a new variety of butterfly dancing around my head.  I love when they land on me.  I have brought friends and family who were visiting me to enjoy this unique up close and personal encounter."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend  Wonderful experience  You must go and see the aquarium exhibit too  Amazing place tons of food and shopping on site  Can't wait to swim with the dolphins next!(;"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and is totally worth the ticket fee.  Be sure to check this out!  Get their first thing to avoid overcrowding."}
{"text":"As we proceeded on our Great American Road Trip, we found ourselves in Phoenix visiting friends, but with some time to kill before they got off work. As luck would have it, we found this hidden gem. The entire family enjoyed it, with my daughter doing her \"gasp-wow\" more than I believe she's ever done before. What I enjoyed most was the chrysalis room where we got to see a luna moth as it emerged from its cocoon. Good stuff."}
{"text":"My 3 year old daughter LOVED this place. She was fully engrossed in the 3D video (about 15 minutes long), adored the butterflies, and had so much fun petting the stingrays. Definitely worth the price of admission, especially on a hot day. The butterfly room is humid, but it's not oppressive. There were probably thousands of butterflies...flying around, on the flowers, on trees, on the ground, and one landed on each of us. Great photo opportunities if you are a photographer. If you have a bug phobia, this is not the place for you, but if you want to get close to butterflies, it's a truly amazing experience."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to have so much fun here! I have been to a butterfly exhibit before and it was nothing like this.  Once you pay for your tickets you walk in and take a group picture. There's a wait time to get into the next short movie they show on how the butterflies adapt and evolve. The movie was 3D and very informative. I learned a lot about butterflies and got to see the full process of them develop. We were then led out to the butterflies!   Their home was so big! They were flying everywhere and to see the eggs and beautiful color wings was awesome. They land everywhere so you have to be careful where you walk and how you move. We all ended up having one land on us and we're able to get some pretty cool pictures. My girls loved to see all the different color butterflies and how they eat. The leaves had a lot of the butterflies babies attached to them.   When you're leaving you go through a room where they check to make sure no butterflies were trying to go home with you.  Definitely a must place to visit!"}
{"text":"It was PACKED today (spring break) and I felt like they didn't know how to handle the crowd. We waited in line forever to buy tickets, then another line to get tickets scanned and hand stamped, and yet another line to get into the theater. No direction. They should have the lines sectioned off, especially one to bypass the theater and enter the emergence gallery and conservatory faster. I feel this process is really inefficient and slow and definitely could be fixed. So that was frustrating.  The 3D movie was awesome. My kids loved it. I loved it actually :)  The emergence area is small and we were packed like sardines in there. But once we got up to the glass, it was cool to see the butterflies emerging from their cocoons.  Next was the conservatory. This is beautiful! It's just so magical having all these colorful butterflies flying all around. It's enchanting. Note - it is really humid in there and my 4 yr old freaked out and I had to take him out for fresh air and water. Keep that in mind with your little ones.  The snack bar/cafe is really expensive. I recommend bringing your own snacks and water.  They have a small section with bugs (we saw honey bees, a scorpion, a tarantula, and ants), and some aquariums and a small sting ray tank in the middle. I wasn't impressed given the cost of admission. The sting rays are tiny and you can barely pet them.  Overall, the crowds made the experience pretty unpleasant, and BW hopefully will work on handling crowds better. In the future I know not to come during high peak (weekends that's a given, but also school breaks).  I think the admission price is too high as well. Not a lot of interactive exhibits and only one movie. I don't think an annual membership is worth it for those reasons (and with 2 kids, I typically spring for the memberships - zoo, science center, children's museum), but I don't think we will be coming back for awhile."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with tons of species that I hadn't seen before.  The educational video was also fascinating.  $20 is a little steep for admission, but I'm sure the operating costs for maintaining 3,000 butterflies and their environment is substantial.  Very zen."}
{"text":"We checked this place out for the first time and I really enjoyed it. I think it's a bit pricey for a 1-2 hour thing, but it was definitely cool and we learned a lot. I heard if you wear a lighter collared shirt you will get more butterflies to land on you. We had dark shirts on so we had no butterflies land on us. But definitely a cool place to go for all ages"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for business but brought the kids so I was looking for something close they could enjoy. My daughter really wanted to see all the pretty butterflies so we decided to come here. Our hotel gave us $3 off coupons so that was good since it's rather pricey for what you get and the amount of time you actually spend here. First off while checking in the lady who stamped our hands asked where we were from when I answered Southern California she said \"oh booo!\" Followed by an awkward laugh. I was a little perplexed, boo? Uh? You're booing my state? Wtf. Sorry but California is all over AZ in every way IMO but I would never boo someone else's state, especially when they're visiting your business, it was so off-putting I didn't know how to respond. So kept it moving, first you watch a 3D movie which we all enjoyed showing the migration of the monarch butterflies. After that you go into the atrium with all the butterflies and it was awesome, one landed on me and stayed with me the entire time. After about 20min the kids were done and that was it. Afterwards they have a sting ray/ fish area and you can touch the sting rays, that was okay. Over all that first impression really set the tone and it was really quick. I spent less money taking my kids to the children's museum and they spent all day having fun. This experience while unique only lasted about an hour and is overpriced. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone especially Californians."}
{"text":"Visiting this was quite the experience. There are butterfies wherever you look; flying around you, landing all around and even on you. And so many colors and sizes! Although it's a little pricey I don't regret this visit. I've been to the butterfly exhibit at Botanical Gardens, but this one is far superior. You are \"encouraged\" to watch a 3D movie prior to entering the atrium, but I wasn't impressed with the movie. But I was totally wowed by the exhibit. If the price was a bit lower I would have given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the overall experience in the desert, a great idea, we loved it. The Atrium was so awesome, but prepare yourself for a humid tropical setting when you step inside. Literally thousands of butterflies are flying about and I got some great pictures of exotic species.  5 Stars for the 3D movie about the life of a Monarch. Now I really want to visit Mexico where these creatures migrate too for winter. 0 Stars for the waiting area.  5 Stars for the Emergence Gallery and witnessing a couple butterflies being born. We spent a lot of time here, though we went into the Atrium first then came back here due to the overcrowding of the small room.  5 Stars for the selection of food in the Café, the sandwiches were so delicious, we found out that they were from The Vermont Sandwich Company close by. The Banana Bread we devoured. Prices were okay. Try their Vermonter or Phish (tuna) sandwich, great flavour.  0 Stars for the Stingray Exhibit, overheard that they were having problems with keeping them alive.  0 Stars for the Bee and Ant colonies. Had lots of questions but no one to answer them for our group.  0 Stars for the Admission Price. Expensive, but now it's off my bucket list. It was extremely hot outside, standing in the sun, waiting in line. They need to construct some sunshades and outdoor seating.  $18.95 per Adult, $9.95 per Child, $16.95 for Students. They're open from 9-5 daily."}
{"text":"Little more than 20 dollars for an adult. You can get a season pass for about 45. If you have a student ID they'll give you a small discount. There's a 3D movie, the butterfly exhibit, small aquarium, live give display(protected by glass) and a small pool to tough sting rays.   Before the big butterfly area, you arrive earlier in the day you can see some butterflies coming out of their cocoon!!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place.  At first I was thinking $23 to see butterflies are you kidding me? But after spending a couple hours inside this magical place, it was well worth every penny.  We arrived shortly after they opened at 9 on a cool Friday and started our visit with a short 3D movie that showcases the amazing migration monarch butterflies take each year-really well done.  Next we entered a room where a variety of bitterly cocoons hung that were near to hatching.  We even saw one hatch before our eyes,  Next we entered a large gymnasium-sized room that was warm and humid-an indoor rain forest of sorts- with lots of flowering trees and thousands of brightly colored butterflies of all sizes fluttering around.  We had to watch where we stepped as some were perched on the ground in sunbeams filtering in through the glass-topped roof.  We spent well over an hour watching and taking pictures of so many beautiful species.  Later a 2nd grade field trip showed up which added a bit of frenzy to the peaceful setting but it was still wonderful.  You can stay as long as you wish inside.  When you are ready to leave you enter a small quarantine room to make sure no butterflies are tagging along on your back in an attempted jail break.  There are also some other exhibits with bugs, reptiles and fish, but we skipped those and the gift shop.  A great place to spend an hour or two.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The experience was the best ......different and they replaced an item taken by TSA and saved my week & the year.......hat off to the front office for taking care a small but sensitive problem ......your the best"}
{"text":"Pro:  You get to enter a room where there is a lot of butterfly flying around you. They also allow you to bring your own snacks as long as you eat it at the cafe.   Con:  The place is small. Not a lot to do with admission pricing. If you don't bring your own food either, expect to pay a lot for peanut butter and jelly sandwich.... -___- The room where the butterflies are located also do not have air-condition (only fans) for climate control so it can get hot."}
{"text":"The 3D film was amazing! My 2 year old loved seeing the butterflies flying everywhere (and landing on her). $18.95 is very steep, but I assume this is to offset the opening overhead costs."}
{"text":"Overall really pretty and relaxing. I brought  My 16 month old son. He got bored too fast. He likes to run jump and be wild so it's not really a good place for him. I did feel that it was over priced. You would not spend more than two hour here probably. 2 and under is free tho so I am happy bc he was pretty bored. I feel like it's probably magical for ages between 3 and 10!  Have fun guys!  It's not that humid but they control the temps in there and occasionally spray some mist.  22 for an adult ticket.  So was around 50 for me and my husband to get in.  Also wear bright clothes! The butterflies will land on bright clothes."}
{"text":"This was my Family's first visit to the Butterfly Wonderland. It was amazing. The variety of species of butterflies was abundant. Also there was a rain forest exhibit - Excellent.  We went on a budget and were very surprised at the high cost of everything - food, souvenirs and the pictures you are made to take before entering. We would have loved to taken home the photo as a souvenir - but at $25 for 1 sheet with two photos - we had to reconsider. Take lots of photos if you are on a budget.   Although our experience in the Butterfly Wonderland was FANTASTIC there was still this shadow of expense looming over us for anything we did other that look at the exhibit. It felt like Disneyland with the overpriced food and souvenirs.   The staff was great and well trained and my Grandson was given food pellets to feed the Koi in the pond. That was really nice.  Overall an excellent experience for my Family.   If you are a Family on a budget - be aware of high priced items. Just enjoy the exhibit."}
{"text":"This exhibit was lovely and the people who work there are all REALLY nice and helpful/knowledgeable, but it is really really pricey. Adults are $18 weekdays and it is really a one hour kind of place. The butterflies are beautiful and the movie about the life of a butterfly is informative."}
{"text":"I loved this experience.  It was great for the kids and it was hard to leave.  The butterflies actually land right on you  and there is every kind you can imagine.  So beautiful.  they had to keep it really humid though so its uncomfortable in phoenix heat.  My only complaint is the price! WAY TO PRICEY. but other then that...wonderful"}
{"text":"This place is a nightmare. Long lines, hot and sweaty, expensive, and uncomfortable. What better than to take your noisy kids to a indoor sauna full of insects crawling over you. For me this is a nightmare. I give it 2/5 stars because maybe it's just not my thing but I couldn't see many people enjoying this. If you're an athletic type I would recommend top golf nearby or the casino nearby. Not my thing. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Very neat and interesting butterfly sanctuary!  The price seems a little high but you get to do and see a good amount for $20.   Got to see some butterflies coming out of their cocoons.  Lots of butterflies in the garden, with plenty of them landing on you!    Wear bright colors if you want them to be attracted to you.  Professional staff as well.   The movie at he beginning should be optional though.  Had to wait 10 minutes for the movie to finish so that we could go in and watch it.  It's a good 14 minute movie but it should be optional."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. A must for all families. Great short 3D movie initially. Then you move on to a large room/walking path with thousands of butterflies around you. Where white or bright flower colors. Or even better a white shirt with colored flowers like my wife and they will keep landing on you."}
{"text":"Amazingly beautiful.  You start with a 3D educational film about the life cycle of the butterfly.  It is 14 minutes in length and really is a great hook for the rest of the experience. Then you get to enter the atrium.  Its so green and lush.  Other yelpers warned about the mist but it is equivalent to what you'd get waiting in line at an amusement park, just not cool mist.  It is supposed to mimic the rain forest.    If your little ones are amazed at the THOUGHT of butterflies but are terrified of bugs... this is not the place for them.  My kids loved looking but were not thrilled with the thought of a butterfly actually being able to land on them.  I, however, loved it.  I think you should go through yourself first and gauge how your little ones may respond.    Back the atrium.  So beautiful with spa like, nature sound music playing in the background.  The colors, the photos you can take.  You're so lucky if you can actually SEE a butterfly land on you.  When you leave they actually have a mirror in the exit room for you to see if any butterflies have landed on you.  One was on my back.  The most beautiful black an purple butterfly.  I wasn't quick enough to get a picture.  But since my husband took my sons out, I have no idea how long they were actually in there. Booo...   So I thought after the atrium, the experience was over.   Whoa, not so.   Stingray, ant and Bee hive exhibit.   After that, small aquarium with a sting ray petting tank.   I am always looking for a quick, fun, tactile and highly educational experience for my boys.    This is it.   The price is $19 per adult and $9 per child They do, however, give a Military and AAA discount."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  We came here on a driving trip vacation from California to Texas.  My wife found that this place was just opened and we specifically decided that we would head to this place.  We were amazed by the butterfly hatchery.  This is the first place that you see when you come here.  They bring in butterfly cocoons from all over the world.  Then you go into the butterfly area.  There are lots of butterflies.  Take a good camera because you will defiantly have a chance to get lots of pictures.  The butterflies fly around and sometimes even land you you.  See some of my pictures.  We really enjoyed it here and we plan on stopping by on our next vacation trip."}
{"text":"The kids love it and that is all that matters!  Tons of Butterflies and right next to OdySea Mirror Maze, which the kids like too.  It looks like they are also building an aquarium here too!  Right off the 101 and easy to get to."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to spend 2 - 3 hours, exploring at your leisure. Play hookey from work to attend  on a weekday when there are less folks in conservatory.  The 3-D movie was amazing, Monarchs so close you can almost \"touch\" them! In the Emergence room, it's fun watching the cocoons shaking & the other windows with different phases of metamorphisis. Wear Light colors, and the butterflies in the Conservatory will land & stay with you for minutes at a time.  Don't miss the Bee runway towards the end of the tour- the workers are allowed out of the building to bring fresh nectar back to the \"hive\" housed inside. The Stingray exhibit is huge, and the Gift Shop  has reasonably priced souveniers. Will be back at least twice a year!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful place if you love butterflies! My daughter is a little young for the exhibit (10.5 months and not walking yet) but we still had a great time. The conservatory where they keep all the butterflies is really humid, so I would dress lightly. There's a great 3D movie that teaches you all about butterflies, I hope to be able to watch that one day. If you have little ones, you can't bring your stroller in the conservatory so I'd suggest a baby carries or wrap and make sure to watch where you walk because there are literally butterflies everywhere :)   A very magical and enchanting place for children and adults, reminded me a little bit of Jurassic park! We ended up getting the year combo pass here & the Aquarium to make it more of a day trip because it made sense if you go at least twice."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me on a surprise trip to Butterfly Wonderland today and it was quite a wonderful experience. I had no idea about this new hidden gem in Scottsdale and I will definitely be returning. You start off by going into the butterfly incubation room where you can see butterfly cocoons and butterflies emerging. There was a liaison in the room describing the metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly and the different incubation times for different species. It is very interesting to see different types of exotic butterfly cocoons. If you get lucky you can sometimes see one emerging from the cocoon.  We then made our way into the butterfly rainforest area. This room is air sealed so you may have to wait a few moments so that they ensure that no butterflies escape in the transition of the doors opening. This room is very muggy and warm so be prepared for that. It is probably around 90 degrees at least and they keep it that way for the butterflies. At certain times a mist is released and it cools it down substantially but you will get hot in this area. If you are like me the hot, muggy environment will not distract you from the peaceful tranquility of the butterflies and plants. This was such a relaxing experience for me. I spent about an hour in this room and could have stayed even longer. You can refer to your visitor's guide and try to spot different species of butterflies. There are many flying around and so many great photo opportunities. Definitely bring a camera. There is a big water fountain in the middle of the room and it is a little cooler in this area. The butterflies also love this area and it is a very peaceful place to sit and relax. I did not find it to be crowded at all and this was a holiday weekend.  The second area that you are able to view after the butterfly rainforest is an exhibit on ants and bees. It is also quite interesting and it is cool to watch the ants burrow and see how they communicate. The bee hive that they have set up is connected to the desert outside and the bees bring back the honey to a see through bee hive. They have facts posted about how the bees collect honey and how they are good for our environment. The last exhibit is a small fresh water aquarium. It is listed in the brochure as an amazon adventure. This is the area of the attraction that is going through growing pains. I think it will be a really cool exhibit once it has been open for a little longer. I did see a couple of dead fish in the tanks but I know that is common when an aquarium is first opening because the tanks have to balance out. They did not have enough information posted about the fish and we were wondering about the species and the area they were indigenous to. They also have a small sting ray pool with very small sting rays. The liaisons were very good about asking if we wanted to touch the sting rays and while we chose not to, many of the little kids were so happy to be able to have that experience.   Overall I had a wonderful time and will definitely be back. This would be a great place to bring kids of any age as well as a great outing for adults. It is very educational and also a peaceful and tranquil environment."}
{"text":"What an amazing time!  My Girlfriend and I spent almost two hours just hanging out and walking around with the Butterflies.   We also enjoyed the 3D movie and small reptile area as all the exhibits were well maintained and you will be surprised at some of the creatures you will see. We were really surprised with this small gem in AZ.  We spent about three hours here and didn't feel rushed.   The food selection in their cafeteria is nothing special but the bathrooms were spotless.  But we didn't come here to eat, we came to hang out with the butterflies!    I suggest eating before coming here and dressing light and bring some bottles of water as the Temperature inside is pretty warm.   Note: Make sure to wear Green as the butterflies will think you are leaves and they will land all over you!"}
{"text":"Cool place. But it is VERY expensive for what you get. A 3D movie, life cycle of butterfly, and walking around the atrium filled with butterfly that land on you. My littles loved the butterfly, but 19 bucks an adult and 10 bucks a kid make for a very pricey trip that lasts about an hour/hour and half depending how long you wonder around the atrium. Would go again if it were cheaper or there was more included in that price. 2 star price, 5 star experince."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!  We went in right as it opened, which is the way to go. It's a little pricey at $19.95, but I think it was definitely worth it. You'll have to make several passes around to see the full spectrum of the butterflies they have (which vary seasonally). You need to be patient, too, as the butterflies won't always open their wings when it's slightly overcast. It's an indoor facility, and fairly humid inside, but the sun shines through. The butterflies will land on you if you stand in the sun and wear a white shirt.   Probably the best part about our experience was that one of our family members studies the butterflies in her free time and ended up giving us an expert tour! Bring a camera and use the guide they give you...it's so fun to identify them! The koi are really cool, too. We even saw some baby quails that hatched only the day before! It's a diverse environment, but it is fairly small. So look for the details! The other must-see is the chrysalis display where you can watch butterflies hatch!   This is one of my very favorite things we did on our Phoenix trip, but go early, or it will be too crowded."}
{"text":"Definely enjoyed the new Rainforest Reptile exhibit.  They also have many new items in the cafe if you're considering eating there (the flatbread pizzas were excellent).  I have to say the parking is still a major issue so can't go up to the perfect rating I used to give this place (before the aquarium came).  While it's still my favorite place to go, if you don't get there as soon as they open, you will probably not get a parking spot. I would be willing to pay extra for parking just to know there is one lot for Butterfly Wonderland & only Butterfly Wonderland.  The aquarium traffic is really ruining what used to be a peaceful zen-like visit here.  Still great inside but good luck finding a place to leave your car! The only time there is any parking is first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"A must visit place, especially with kids. Very peaceful, educational & entertaining place. We had a good time"}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular.  The beginning can be hectic since everyone goes in and out the same theater door. And the emergence room can be  busy.  But waiting to enter and exit the atrium is very understandable and very worth it. You can spend countless hours here. The perfect indoor place for short legs.  This is butterfly care and science at its best.  The bees,  ants an aquarium are a great plus to the visit. Heads up - Atrium is warm and humid but beautiful."}
{"text":"Ok, this may not be any fun if you have small children. Our 6 year old did not like the butterflies landing on her and did not want to spend any time in the habitat. She also found the movie a little scary as it had a lot of close ups of the butterfly in the various stages of its life cycle. The movie is in (3) D and really well done.  We bought the combo ticket which included the mirror maze. I would skip this as it is nothing and costs about $9 per person.  The people were friendly and they have a small aquarium area. The place is only one year old and still trying to find its niche. They are adding attractions so it will be a better experience in (6) months."}
{"text":"We had a nice time but i feel it was extremely overpriced!! There's just not that much to do but walk around and look at the butterflies and take pictures. Much too expensive for this!!!"}
{"text":"At first I was hesitant to take my daughter. I thought we would be extremely bored looking at butterflies. But when we went I was in aww. Butterflies everywhere. They were flying in between us and landing on us. It was beautiful. We will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"PRICE OF ADMISSIONS: It's 20.00 for adults and 10.00 for kids. Rounded out to be 34.00 with tax. So it was essentially what I expected.  3D MOVIE: The movie was amazing! It's about 15 minutes long and it's in 3D. There's a point in the movie where thousands of butterflies seem to surround you. That was really fun and cool.  BUTTERFLY ROOM: Was awesome. There were so many vibrant colors of butterflies. Took some great pictures. Interesting to see what kind of habitat they thrive in. There should be an age limit to go in thru though. (No kids under 6 years)  There were butterflies on the ground and there were a lot of toddlers dancing around. Made the experience a little stressful.  BEE/STINGRAY/FISH EXHIBIT: Was terrible. In a corner is a stand with a \"jenga style\" casing of a colony of bees. It was neat to see but again, almost stuffed in a corner. There were two stingrays at the very bottom of a fairly large tank in the middle of the next room but the water was a little blurry so you could just see their shadows. Fish exhibit was eh...  GIFT SHOP: Ridiculously overpriced! T-shirts were 30.00+, book marks 6.00, stuffed animals were 35.00 and up.  OVERALL: I was disappointed. Started off great with the 3D movie and the butterfly conservatory and ended with random setups almost half thought thru and a crazy expensive gift shop."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Start with a 3D movie Flight of the Monarchs.  Pretty cool visual and information of monarchs migration.  Then the area where crystallize of butterflies was neat to see them coming out of their cocoon.  Then one of the largest conservatory with several species of butterflies n moths, beautiful koi pond.  Its fairly humid but you can go in and out if it gets too warm.  My niece who loves pokemon used the pamphlet we had to find all the butterflies listed she loved it and a fun treasure hunt game for kids.  Highly recommend for families and kids that love butterflies.  There is a cafe which had reasonable prices for ice cream.  A pretty gift shop to find a pretty souvenir."}
{"text":"Such a fun outing to see the 3d movie, the butterflies hatching and then the atrium where they can land on you.  There are some issues.  Make sure you go early if its hot, because the atrium is outside and to cooled, plus they pump it full of mist to make it a humid heat.  We could only stay out there about 10 minutes before the kids felt sick.  The café is very overpriced and does not allow you to even take your drink out of their little area through the last part on the way out.  There are bees, ants and other bugs to look at.  There are 2 stingrays, this is not like at the zoo, it will take you a while to get to actually pet one.   We have a membership and not sure that we will do it again, because it doesn't change."}
{"text":"My kids and I enjoy coming here on a Sunday afternoon. Price is good and they have fun."}
{"text":"Four solid stars.   The 3D movie was the highlight.  The butterfly exhibit was beautiful.  Dress in layers because it's really warm in there.   There are so many butterflies in there.  My 1 year old and 4 year old were terrified of butterflies because they get so close and some land on you.   We didn't last a long time.  But it is very nice for older kids.   The older kids in there were having a nice time."}
{"text":"OK --- I will second, third and fourth the motion that this place is way too expensive.   It will be financially in jeapordy in about 1.5 years after the novelty has worn off,  and then they'll be begging you poor saps in Scottsdale to bail them out financially with a bond effort !!!       Add not only to the expensiveness of the place, how about the poor set up.   No signs that I saw  telling you where to stand for the movie, no signs telling you when the movies begin or end --- and if I missed them, my bad.   If they weren't there, shame on the dope that designed this place.  Atrium sanctuary is the only good part of the entire place, albeit the movie was so-so.    Oh and the ant and beehive display room --- ho-hum???  Behive somewhat OK, as compared to the ant farm, which was lame and should be pulled from their website as even an attraction.   I've seen better ant farms in my cubbards when my wife spilled sugar in the very back of it and ant's from way outside found it !!!   I've seen other comments that the employees were rude.   Not so much rude, just had no zeal to be there really.  Like they could care less about their jobs, which is understandable if they are making minimum wage, but as much as this place charges, they all had better be making six figures !!!!!!!!    And maybe that is their problem, they are overpaid.    My opinion --- if your kids are into butterflies --- go online and order one of those butterfly sanctuary kits, where they mail you the caterpillars, a neat box with windows and all the info you need to help your caterpillars go through the stages of becoming a butterfly.    Worth more money in memories than this place."}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of the other comments but for a family friendly place it was great. The 3-d movie was for my daughters first 3d experience. It was quick and to the point. The butterfly garden was great. It was humid but the misters helped and there were so many amazing butterflies. My daughter loved taking photos and trying to get them to land on her. I wish there would have been more info on the different types of butterflies. When we left the butterfly garden we went in to see the bees and ants which were very small and I wish there was more info on them too. The water tanks were cool but the sting ray pool was not even working either. More info would be great but we will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"$18.95 for adults & 10% off for AAA members...and ps wear bright colored shirts it attracts the butterflies :-)  What a truly beautiful place!!!! A place right out of a fairytale!!! We were in Arizona visiting my mom for the holiday weekend & was searching for interesting things to do while we were here. Have to say there wasnt tooo too much going on in scottsdale but this is the diamond in the rough!!!! To be able to walk amongst thousands of beautiful butterflies just living their lives is such a breathtaking experience!!!   When i first brought the idea of coming here up to the boys they looked at me liked...butterflies?? are you serious?? but the way their faces lit up when we all entered into the atrium/greenhouse & were surrounded by butterflies was PRICELESS!!!! I wasnt too sure if this was a place more geared towards kids or adults too but I swear all the pictures a group of 5 adults took & the looks on all our faces was reason enough for all adults to check this place out. I will say there are ALOT of kids here...When you walk into the facility after buying your tickets you watch a short 3D movie on butterflies...its actually pretty cool...but hard to enjoy it completely with all the screaming & shouting children but once you get into the atrium it calms down a tad...but remember it is a great place for kids to learn as well so prepare yourself for that if your not a huge fan of the little hoodlums haha.  It really is indescribable. They are everywhere...whizzing past your heads...landing on a flower right next to you...feasting on the bowls of fruit they had laid all over the place & in the middle of it all was a great waterfall fountain. IDK why but it took me a little bit to get used to them landing on me..i would get a little scared & fidgidy like how am i so sketchy about such a beautiful creature hahaha so it may take a bit getting used to not flinching when they waft your way. But it is such a perfectly peaceful place & there is no other place like it. The best part of all is the butterflies actually land on you if you stand still!!! I had one chill on my hand long enough to get some pictures with it!! My advice to all is where BRIGHT colored clothing & shirts & that will attract them to land on you. My mom had on a teal shirt and they would land on her every chance they got. Another guy had 2 butterflies mating on his pant leg for the entire time he was there lol. You can stay in the atrium as long as you like just watch your step because some will land on the ground and just relax there lol.    The one & only reason we didnt stay in the atrium forever is because it is SUPERRRRR hot & humid...ladies...if you dont want your hair getting frizzy either wear it up or wear a hat because we all came out sweaty, wet & looking like we walked thru a monsoon.  They also have a few other rooms with a sting ray petting tank & reptile & spider terreriums as well as you get to see hundreds of butterflies in their cryssalis stage of life..we even got to see a few emergeing from their cocoons!!!  This is such a beatiful place & you really learn alot being here & i would recommend EVERYONE check it out. You will really be taken away to a midsummer nights dream!"}
{"text":"We came here with our toddler daughter and she loved the experience of having butterflies land on her. The 3D film was a fun intro to the butterfly world. The highlight was really the large room where the butterflies were flying and landing on people. It was pretty crowded  on the day we went but we enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Had an absolute blast! Aimed at kids but I'm 24 and still LOVED it! I'm amazed at these beautiful insects!"}
{"text":"Took my 2-year old daughter to the newly opened Butterfly Wonderland and we had a lot of fun. Admission is a little high (2 years and younger are Free though but about $20 for adults), but aside from that there's lots to do and the experience was great. There's a natural flow to the \"tour\" of this wonderland. You start with a 3-D movie on butterflies then proceed to the massive outdoor aviary. There are tens of thousands of butterflies floating / landing / eating / nesting all around you- and may varieties. The aviary is extremely humid to provide an appropriate habitat for the insects so dress accordingly (imagine the worst day in Florida heat). You can easily spend an hour or more in the aviary- snapping pics for Instagram and watching your kids' expressions as they see butterflies all around them. It's large enough that it does not seem crowded and there are employees everywhere to answer your questions.   After the butterfly aviary you can head back inside (A/C yes!) to see the large ant farm and honeybee hive- boys will particularly enjoy this section. There's also a nicely sized aquarium with about 5-6 tanks full of cool fish. There's also a good sized sting ray pool for the kids to \"touch and feel\" at will.   Your final stop is the cafe and gift shop. It might be worth your time to cool down in the cafe after visiting the aviary - cold bottle of water and juice for the kids. The gift shop is also nice (pricey) and has a little something for everyone. You can collect hole punches from employees throughout your visit on a \"kids card\" and trade in for a special prize at the end of your visit. The smaller kids will love it.  I would suggest an early morning visit to avoid larger crowds in the aviary. You can swipe your credit card to pay for admission, and bring some cash for the cafe."}
{"text":"Our first visit today and had a wonderful time with our family and grandchildren. Our two and a half year old granddaughter had a blast! The atrium was amazing and we were fortunate as since we went early the crowds were small. We were there for the 3 year birthday party and so enjoyed the extra activities such as face painting."}
{"text":"The 3-D movie and atrium are great. It's over-priced for the time you actually spend there. Taking a family and out of town visitors turns into a $200 trip for maybe 2 hours. I really wish they extended the military discount to police/fire like most places, but they don't which is a little thoughtless on their part."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here and was so happy to be able to share the experience with my kids. This is such an cool place and so many different things you are able to see and interact with right when you walk in. You start with a really cool 3D movie that's about 15 minutes long and tells you a lot about the butterfly . I couldn't believe how much I didn't know. Next you walk into a room where you get to see a lot of chrysalis hanging and actually get to watch new butterflies coming out of their cocoons. So cool. My kids at this point were even more excited to get into the actual exhibit. After learning some more about the chrysalis we walked into the exhibit. I will tell you they warn you ahead of time how humid it is when you walk in and man they are right. If this is something you think your body can't handle be cautious. It was beautiful! I could not believe how many different butterflies there were. All different colors and sizes. My daughter was a little freaked out at first with them flying so close..she's 16 lol, but once they started landing on her brothers she got jealous ha ha and didn't want to leave until she got one to come to her. There is also a huge coi pond to sit and look at as well as a small honey bee exhibit. All very cool. We spent well over an hour inside with the butterflies before we did have to step out to the cooler air , but more so because the kids were hungry. It was very expensive, but if you love to learn and try something most people do g get s chance to then it's worth it to me. My kids could not stop talking about it and were so happy. I'd say that's a day worth it all. Win win for mom since they learned some new things as well. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and loved it both times! I saw some people skip the movie, but I would recommend watching it cuz you'll learn a lot about the Monarch Butterfly and the 3D is really cool! Wear bright colors to attract the butterflies, but it is a bit humid in the Butterfly area so dress accordingly. Then prepare yourself for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"GO. Period - end of story. You just need to go.   Seriously, though - I have been to a number of butterfly atriums and this one was definitely my favorite. (we didn't do the maze thing next door, just the butterfly place). Very interesting film on the front end (SUPER interesting). The Atrium itself is the largest I've ever seen. The number of butterflies was almost overwhelming (it might be the time of year). There were a few times that you looked up and almost felt a bit of vertigo because so much was flying overhead.  Lots of different kinds, colors, sizes, shapes. You just can't go to a place like this and leave in a bad mood.  Stop what you're doing and add it to your to-do list now. You'll be glad you did. (ps - I read a couple of reviews about the room temperature... uh, it's kind of expected when you go to this kind of facility. I went 4th of July weekend, it was perfectly fine and what I expected)"}
{"text":"Gosh... This place is great.  A butterfly conservatory where you can frolic amongst the butterflies.  ...But...before being turned loose in the atrium, you get to watch a short film.  At the beginning, it introduces a caterpillar that will become a butterfly. I became so choked up from trying to hold my laughter somewhere around this part...   \"After the caterpillar hatches, it is very hungry and immediately snacks on it's shell casing...\" It proceeds to show the caterpillar doing so while making slurpy eating sounds. Then I hear a lady scoff... \"That's disgusting.\"  I barely held it together.  The atrium is awesome and fun. My friend and I stayed a pretty long while. A butterfly landed on my arm and stayed with me the entire time. I imagined that it would eventually flutter away naturally before the time came for us to leave. But not exactly, my friend's face suddenly turned flustered as he flash-backed to his \"living in Florida days\" do to the heat and humidity contained inside the atrium. He said \"I can't take it anymore, we must leave now.\" I'm like... \"But there is a butterfly resting on me.\" I insisted that I wanted her to naturally drift away! He eventually \"naturally\" made a puff of air with his mouth and blew it towards my arm. There is still an ongoing debate about the \"naturalness\" of this.   So...  If your timing is right you'll even get to see a butterfly hatch from a cocoon. You'll also learn how to tell male or female. You'll just learn A LOT of things. You'll really love it."}
{"text":"The butterfly habitat is very nice. It's basically a greenhouse with lots of butterflies flying around. Lovely if you like butterflies. I withheld a star because the reptile and fish exhibits you have to walk through after you leave the butterflies on the way out are really, really sad. The habitats are very small and filled with plastic plants. The animals seem very unhappy and looking for ways to escape. Some are alone, and none have room to have the exercise and adventure they would have in the wild. It was 2 days ago that I left and although I enjoyed the butterflies very much, I am still saddened every time I think of the other creatures in those small tanks."}
{"text":"Very nice place. The admission price is WAY TO EXPENSIVE for what they have to offer right now. I ONLY recommend it for butterfly lovers."}
{"text":"I just wanted to give a huge thank you to a wonderful woman named Dawn whom we encountered three times during our visit. The first, she engaged my two young daughters, let us take pictures with a butterfly that they were caring around with a sweet brush, and answered all of our questions. She was so sweet and kind to us. The second, she witnessed my daughter fall and hit her head. She waited and gave us an adequate amount of time to comfort her, and then approached us asking if she was alright and if she needed anything. She offered an ice pack, to go inside to cool off, a soda? Anything to make her feel better. She was very genuine and caring.  She even asked later if she was okay. The third time we left and realized we left a jacket. We came all the way back and asked the front desk if anyone had found one. They said no and that was that.  I decided to go in and look for myself, because I knew it had to be in there somewhere. Then we saw dawn walking by. I quickly asked her, she said no but didn't let it be that. She went above and beyond and offered to walk us around and ask lost and found, look in the theater, and the exhibit where we finally found it. She even gave me a hug! She was such a life saver today and was so appreciated. She's the definition of amazing customer service."}
{"text":"Most definitely a great experience if you have young ones. There is an educational video for all and a nice large atrium to actually interact with a plethora of butterflies. I would highly recommend this place for kiddos. However, being older now and actually have learned about butterflies at a younger age, this place is a \"been there done that\" type of experience for the adults.  This is a neat place to have in phx."}
{"text":"Took the family here and had a good experience overall. The butterfly exhibit was nice.  Been to something similar a few times, and it is definetly cool to see the variety of butterflies up close. The 3D butterfly movie was informative, and gave a nice overview of the life of the monarch butterfly. They did have a very small reptile section.  Nothing to get excited about,  but I was able to catch a Boa yawning, which was maybe my highlight of the visit. They also have a very small sea life section.  And that was about it. I wouldn't expect to spend too much time here. You can easily see everything in an hour or two.   They had a nice gift shop, and they had two penny machines for those that need to fill their penny passports."}
{"text":"So we checked out the Butterfly Wonderland today and I will say it is fairly cool and should be a nice addition to the many attractions in the greater Phoenix area for kids/families.   Cons - Price. Prices seem high. We actually ended up buying the lifetime membership (I know, I know, suckered into it! HA!), but considering our kids are small, it should easily pay for itself. But for a small family for the daily admission, it is easily $50, which to me seems like a lot. It is also EXTREMELY humid in the butterfly exhibit. I read other reviews saying it was humid, but dang, it is HUMID. Like so misty in there that you can't see across the entire exhibit since it is so foggy. This isn't necessarily a con or a bad thing, just be prepared. Don't bother showering or doing your hair. ;)   Pros - The 15 min long 3D butterfly movie is fairly cool. Fun to watch the smaller kids all reaching out to \"touch\" the butterflies during the movie. They also have a room with various stages of cocoons and you can even watch butterflies emerge if you are patient enough. The butterfly room, although humid, is very beautiful. The exhibit will be better as the plants grow in, but overall pretty well done already. The volunteers/people answering questions in the exhibits were friendly and helpful. They also have a small room with some ants, scorpions and bee exhibits. Interesting, but nothing nearly as exciting as the butterflies. They also have room with various fish tanks and an open tank for petting/touching sting rays.  There is definitely some newness/growing pains since they recently opened, but I think once this is worked through, it will be well worth everyone to at least check it out once. We were there about 2 1/2 hours and it was definitely a nice relief from the 110 degree heat outside (even with the humidity!)"}
{"text":"Really unique experience. A little pricey for what it offers, but it can't be cheap to operate, so I can understand. With such few fun summertime options for the kids, I'm happy to have it in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Talk about amazing. The Butterflies are beyond words... So beautiful. Wear bright colors for sure. We also did the maze which was short but fun. The movie you watch prior to going into the exhibit was interesting... It is not something I would go over and over again but i definitely enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I went on September 1st and I have to say I was miserable.  It was over 65.00 for two adults and a 5yr and 8yr old.  We waited in a long line front from the begining and then went to see a movie.  The movie was good and we did like that but everything else was poor.  This place is beautiful on the outside but a poor set up on the inside.  Hot and humid and the butterfly exhibit though beautiful had dead ends in each section, It would of been more functional to keep it going with the walk way so it was not so congested. Also the ant exhibit was horrible and the fish tanks were really no big deal.  We live in Arizona so we know what scorpions are.  Just think the fee to get in was way to much for what you were given.  The cafeteria cost 13.00 for two bags of candy and two juice boxes and then you leave thru the gift store which every kid was complaining as they wanted a toy or somthing.  Clever on the store part but not fair to the parents.  We bought a plastic butterfly ring and with tax as 4.91 for a 10 cent ring. I will never go back and I bet this will be closed down before to long.   Sorry but have to be honest."}
{"text":"it was amazing, I loved the manta rays and the butterflies were really cool. they plan on expanding it soon. There were a lot of helpful volunteer and spiders and snakes and other reptiles as well."}
{"text":"Butterfly Wonderland just opened up May 25th, and there were a lot of families and couples lined up to experience America's newest and largest butterfly conservatory.   Admission is about $19 for each adult, with senior and student discounts. When you enter, you have the choice of seeing the 3D movie or moving onward to the next room. The movie is around 15 minutes, and shows off the 3D views and pretty imagery rather than a lot of informative discussion about the monarch butterfly.  After the movie, you enter a room that showcases the different pupae that are in the process of transforming into a butterfly. Since there was a large crowd when we went, there was a little bit of a wait for patrons in the actual conservatory to exit before more could enter.  The actual conservatory is a photography student's dream. The landscape is a bit ethereal as various butterflies flutter by you. Some may even land on you for a quick second before taking off again. Although we did have a guide to the different species of butterflies in our brochure, there wasn't much else in terms of education about the different butterflies.  The next section after the conservatory shows a honeybee colony and several ant colonies. The ant colonies in agar were lighted up with neon, making it look like the ants were having a rave. It was cool to see the honeybees, with the queen marked with a green dot to differentiate her from the other bees.  There is also a set of nice aquariums, and a touch pool with stingrays. The aquarium was a weird addition to a butterfly conservatory I thought. The fish were all freshwater common species you could find at your nearest Petsmart (e.g., African cichlids, various gourami, neon tetras). There were a few signs listing the species, but not all the aquariums were labeled. Like the butterfly section, the stingray and fish section didn't have a lot of educational information in them.   It took us about an hour to browse through everything. The experience here is nice, but it's more of a visual experience rather than a learning one. Some things that might be good for the exhibits are more information about butterfly conservation, why the different species of butterflies are differently colored, and how different cultures view butterflies. Since there are so many children that visit the conservatory, it would be nice for them to be enticed to learn about nature in addition to the visual interactive beauty of the butterflies."}
{"text":"This place is fun for the kids and adults. The 3d imax like movie was fun. Watching the Butterflies flitter about in the atrium was also fun, but be prepared for the humidity. Overall worth the money and a fun experience.  They will be building an aquarium in about a year so it will be a more robust experience."}
{"text":"Very cool place. The 3D video in the beginning is great! But, of course, the atrium is where it's at. Really could spend forever just looking at the butterflies and it's a photographers dream. Gave it 3 stars because it seems over pretty quickly for the price. Might as well make more a day of it and go to Odysea next door too. They have a deal for both tickets."}
{"text":"Butterfly Wonderland was so amazing to walk through!  I was worried my young son would try and grab a butterfly or we might accidentally step on one but NOPE! it was nice and humid and the butterflies were just batting around us, how magical is that? It's a fairly fast process and unless your older and want to admire all around.  The tickets were a little steep especially for the amount of time we actually stayed in the actual Wonderland but it would be easy to stay longer if the children were again, older.  I will be back soon and suggest you try out butterfly Wonderland for yourself!"}
{"text":"So fun!! We love BFW. My kids school does field trips here every year. The IMAX video is awesome & so informative!!! And we love the butterflies and the other critters. But go with water and a snack because the butterfly exhibit is very humid and hot. Kids seem to get hungry!! Make sure to wear bright colors if you want to better place to land on you, they seem to like the color orange. A boy in my group had a butterfly laying eggs on his golden hair today!!"}
{"text":"This place was great for our 2 year old. There is a movie at the beginning that I highly recommend you watch! The actual butterfly exhibit is a lot smaller that what I was expecting and I imagine it gets really crowded. We went on Sunday morning right when it opened and there were very few people which was nice! Overall we really liked it!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit! We really enjoyed the time we spent here."}
{"text":"If you love butterflies, then this is a must while your in Arizona. You start off watching a great 3d movie that explains the life of a monarch butterfly. After you exit the movie you can watch for hatching butterflies or walk into the Butterfly Wonderland."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect, except to duck in out of the last August heat. The movie was educational and not at all boring. The staff was very generous with their time and expertise. The butterfly room was stunningly beautiful and peaceful. I had never seen anything like it. We stayed for a long while because we were charmed at every turn. We ranged from 6-65 in age and became even more devoted to the preservation of wildlife. Can't wait to go back to see the new aquarium adjacent."}
{"text":"Overall a great and fun experience.    Came here with my little pumpkin to explore and try something new.  I recommend arriving when the opens as it wasn't busy at all and had ample space to enjoy ourselves.   Butterflies galore. I did not expect so many and so many varieties. You literally walk around and they are flying everywhere landing where they please.  They have a pleasant Koi pond right in the middle where you can enjoy a seat next to these beautiful fish. It is a bit humid in there as they regulate the temps for the butterflies so dress accordingly.   Once you've had your fill make your way through the cafe to a small portion or the aquarium that is open. Just a few fish tanks with fresh water fish and a sting ray pen where you can touch them ( wash your hands prior ) they have a sink nearby.   Had a great time. Only downside is it is pricey for what you get.  Sort of seen it once I'm good not sure I'd be back unless there was a major attraction change."}
{"text":"One of the coolest things to do in Phoenix area. A bit pricey but it's a neat experience for both adults and kids. Didn't know so many kinds of butterflies existed and its fun seeing them fly around in the open.   My only complaint is that the woman who was working the front to take the tickets was rude and had a stank attitude when we didn't know we had to get the tickets in the gift shop. It was a weekday and it was slow. We were excited to be there...she could at least crack a smile."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We definitely recommend going! We loved having the butterflies all around us!"}
{"text":"This is a magnificent treat to visit if you're in the Scottsdale area. There's a fantastic educational 3D movie, helpful labels and staff that are knowledgeable and pleasant too. The butterfly enclosure had a wonderful variety of butterflies to observe. And the hatching area was also interesting to see. There are some gratuitous fish and desert insect displays (in other words, not very extensive - but still cool to see) besides the butterflies. I didn't try the cafe, but there is one if you get hungry. The gift shop offers a wide variety of on-theme merch at different price points. And, you can spend a fortune buying the requisite tourist-spot (e.g, large markup) shot of yourself in front of a green screen (that allows the Wonderland folks to Photoshop your image into a rainforest backdrop with butterflies thrown in for color). Perhaps because I know that memory card images are free and sheets of printer paper cost $1-2 max for the quality used, the price seemed high. But if the remembrance is worth it to you, it's a cute memento... Be aware the entry price to the Wonderland is also high. I'm assuming they're plowing the majority of their funds into the ongoing construction of the SeaWorld-like place that's going in next door. Check the Wonderland out. It's worth a visit to see those terrific butterflies."}
{"text":"This place was a total surprise for me.  I was not expecting much but really enjoyed the whole experience.  The 3-d movie was fantastic and one of the best films made in 3-d I have ever seen.  It was very serene to be in the butterfly garden and to see so many of them fluttering about.  The aquariums and sting ray touch tank was a bonus!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like and admire butterflies?  If you don't, then you are missing out. These little creatures transform from a mass that barely moves into a colorful, graceful,  delicate little air dancing machine.  The Butterfly Wonderland has the largest atrium in the US for butterflies to roam around.  It's quite an amazing site watching these amazing little spectacles fly around near plants that grow well here in AZ. So if you're a plant lover then this place will be of interest to you as well.  Upon arrival here, some may be shocked with the admission price of $18.95 for adults and $10 for kids. If you're budget friendly this is not the place for you.  I feel that this place is definitely worth it to check out, but with the lofty admission I could see guests only coming back every so many years and not becoming regulars.  Overall the place is not huge so give yourself about an hour and a half to enjoy everything. Make sure to not skip the 3D Monarch butterfly show as you start your journey."}
{"text":"The movie was very informative and it's pretty seeing the butterfly exhibit. The staff is accommodating and friendly. I have been to several other butterfly exhibits outside of AZ and they are usually not stand alone but connected to other exhibits so that's why I rated it down. I'm not sure that it's worth visiting more than once or the price of the exhibit is worth it. I love butterflies so I would have gone regardless."}
{"text":"Wow! This museum is truly amazing and fun for all ages. The greenhouse where the butterflies are kept is a true wonderland, even though it is especially hot and humid. Bring an extra shirt to change into. ;) the variety of fluttering butterflies is amazing. They alight on you if you stand still long enough. It is fun to observe others who have no idea they have butterflies on their back.   We brought our toddlers and they loved the pond, waterfall and larger butterflies   as they toddler around.  A definite fun experience for 1.5-2 hours. The aquarium and reptile areas were fun as well! They feed the fish at about 11 AM, which makes it fun to watch.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A tad bit overpriced, but the kids loved it. Very educational experience for kids and adults. The movie was in 3D and a great part of the experience."}
{"text":"To be completely honest, I was coerced into coming to this place. It wasn't one of the must-see places for me while visiting Phoenix however I actually really enjoyed myself here. If I were to sum up my experience in one word, I would probably say it was \"unique\".   I enjoyed learning about butterflies and how they migrate. The film you watch before entering the butterfly forest was very educational. The actual butterfly museum was very nice. I will warn you that it is very humid and misty. I would also recommend that you wear bright colors. This attracts the butterflies to you.   This place is fun for all ages but for me was a little on the expensive side ($19 per adult). I would definitely recommend bringing kids here. The kids seem to love this place. Overall, I had an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this a 3.5.  Very cool to check out, but not something I'd do very often as it's pricey. Many places around Phoenix have very good membership deals like the Botanical Gardens (who also have a smaller butterfly exhibit annually) or the Natural History Museum. I probably would have bought a membership if it was reasonable (there are no memberships for couples without children, so it'd be $100 a year for just two), but you'd have to really go a lot to get your money's worth.   Also, if you're looking for a relaxing butterfly experience, this isn't it. I'd recommend checking out t he Botanical Gardens to see if they're doing their butterfly exhibit. It's much calmer. Beware: going during the middle of the week does not mean less kids, they are a hotspot for class field trips, and the ratio of adults-to-children may actually be lower midweek than on the weekends.  If you're good with crowds, Butterfly Wonderland has a great 3D film that I haven't seen anything like other places.   Also: I recommend dressing in layers! The theater is a bit chilly but the butterfly pavilion is quite muggy. A tank top + sweatshirt is perfect."}
{"text":"I went here a few years ago and didn't know what to expect. I was not disappointed. They had this cool documentary about monarch butterflies and how they migrate from a forest in Mexico all the way to Canada through Texas and back to Mexico. This takes multiple generations of butterflies. They eat milkweed. Since my sister lives in Texas I told her about it and she and her kids ended up planting milkweeds in her garden for them. You then go into this sealed room where there are a ton of butterflies. It's so cool. They come and land on your clothes. They are all different colors. I definitely recommend this place. Very kid friendly"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I can understand why some people may think it's pricey, but you're paying for such a unique experience that I believe it to be completely worth it.  We had a large group of all ages including some of my family in town from the Northeast, and everyone had a fantastic and memorable time.  Perfect spot for kids of all ages!"}
{"text":"This is unique, fun, and a great way to be a kid again! It is a little pricey but I thought it was worth it and would do it again. The video is educational and really makes you appreciate what it takes in nature for all these amazing species to survive. The room with the cocoons is really neat and you actually see some emerging at times. The actual butterfly pavilion is amazing. So many beautiful butterflies and they land right on you and it is peaceful and amazing. Then they have a small exhibit with bees and ants and scorpions etc. They do try to sell you a picture but ours came out really great so we got it as a fun souvenir. I would go back maybe once every six months as something fun and different to do!"}
{"text":"We got a 10 percent discount from the hotel we were staying so well worth the price.  The 3-D movie was only about 15 minutes, but it was cool.  And the butterflies were gorgeous.  Next you go into a room where you can see butterfly chrysallis and they're actually hatching out of them right then and there.  If you have the patience, you can see several different types of butterfly emerging.  Next area is where all the butterfly are.  There are a ton.  Way more than you'd see at the butterfly attraction in San Diego.  The minute you walk in, there are a swarm of butterflies.  You have to watch where you place your feet as well, as there are butterflies on the ground as well.    Several butterflies landed on my daughter.  She was both thrilled and nervous.  She wanted them to land on her, but it scared her a little.  At one point, I had three butterflies landing on my shirt.    This is a great place for photographers.  You'll get a ton of butterfly photographs and there's so many different varieties.  The only drawback is that it is quite humid and hot.  My husband turned bright red, so we had to take a break in their snack room.   There's plenty of parking.  It's going to be part of the Odyssea complex some day.  It looks awesome.  I can't wait to go back when everything is in place."}
{"text":"I didn't really set any expectations for this place because I have never been to anything like this.  It was a fun experience.  The 3D movie at the beginning was really interesting.  The atrium was very humid, there are butterflies EVERYWHERE! I felt a bit intimidated as I was in their environment.  I was wary when walking because many of them land on the floor.  It's quite difficult to capture them as they fly around.. resulting in photos of flying black dots.  Its a great place to take kids.  As for the pricey entrance.. we would not come back unless we someone out of state were to visit."}
{"text":"Went here on an adult field trip with my girlfriend. It was a great date activity. It's a little hot to be going here in the Summer, and it's definitely humid inside with the butterflies, but it's worth going for sure.   We went ahead and bought annual passes because that's like our thing now - annual passes for shit we'll end up going to just once or twice. We were bummed to find out we had just missed the lifetime passes - they stopped selling them.   But there's a ton of cool stuff to see here besides just butterflies, and the 3d movie was entertaining. We got our money out of it. The photography opportunities here are fantastic. I brought my dslr and snapped off a bunch. If you're into photography at all, this is a great place to go as well. The atrium is well laid out and there's even a nice koi pond in the middle... we probably wandered around for a good hour and a half or so.   Watch your step - you may squish one. They are pretty good about cleaning up the casualties and they are also good about warning visitors not to be dicks - but people are dicks so you may see some trampled on butterflies. Just be aware.  If you're a parent and bringing your children here and they don't understand death yet and will cry when they see a dead butterfly and you aren't ready to have that talk... or they misbehave and pull wings off or kill insects because you are raising a serial murderer - then this probably isn't the place for you. Take your kid to the playground at McDonalds and feed them a happy meal. This is a more sophisticated outing for a more sophisticated child and parent. It's an educational thing and also might spark a love for butterflies.   Dudebros - this is a great place to take a chick on a date - but maybe not in the Summer - her makeup will sweat off her face and her hair will frizz out. If she's cool with that, then you've got yourself a good one. If you're not cool with that as a dudebro, then maybe you are shallow and should talk to someone about it... I don't know.   The giftshop is neat and filled with some good stuff, but it's all very expensive. Overall, it's a great experience that doesn't cost much more than going to the movies and provides a much more unique experience."}
{"text":"For being the biggest butterfly exhibit in the US it is not that big... I had a great time nonetheless :) once you walk in you watch an informative 3D movie about the monarch butterfly. Afterwards, you see the butterfly chrysalis and some moth cocoon displays. Awesome! The best part is once you pass this and walk into a room where they explain the rules about the exhibit. NO TOUCHING BUTTERFLIES!! :'(((( blah! That's ok because they are allowed to touch you! :) Once you spend an ungodly amount of time chasing butterflies and begging them to land on you, back in the building you go to enjoy some desert bugs and aquariums."}
{"text":"This place is definitely overpriced for the size. The exhibit takes about 15 minutes to look at the butterflies.  I took two toddlers and they were quickly bored with this place. I hope their aquarium is better and not overpriced. For the price of this place for 4 I can travel to Tucson and see a much better butterfly exhibit and lunch."}
{"text":"We had a great time, and cannot stress enough how many butterflies there are!  They have a great room where you see the entire life cycle of the butterflies, from chrysalis to hatching to being ready to go into the conservatory to fly around and be admired.  You wait for a guide to let you into a \"holding area\" of sorts, have to make sure no butterflies escape from the conservatory area.  Unfortunately for my husband when the guide opened the door between the holding area into the conservatory a butterfly flew in low and went under his foot and he unfortunately stepped on it.  It happened in a nano-second and we were mortified.  He lifted his foot up as soon as he realized it, and we really hope it was OK.  When they say watch where you walk they mean it.  We have been to a similar place in Massachusetts many times so we know the drill, this was a fluke thing.  You don't even know where to look there is so much activity and so many beautiful butterflies!  They give you a handout when you come in with photos of the butterflies and you honestly see pretty much all of the ones pictured (like 30 different ones!).  They also have a koi pond, frogs, lizards, scorpions, and fish.    I had to take a star away from their 5-star experience we had because of the pricing in the cafe.  You cannot consume outside food or beverage, and $2.95 plus tax for a 20 oz bottle of Aquafina water is obnoxious.  We already paid almost $50 for two adult admissions, so when our 18 month old was having a breakdown because she was hot and thirsty we had to get her water, and felt it was a bit excessive.    If we lived in the area we would be members, because every week they get chrysalis in and I imagine it is fun to see all different butterflies!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. There's over 2,000 butterflies fluttering around. We had quite a few land on us. Got some great shots of some just breath taking butterflies! The staff was so nice and took time out to talk to you and tell you a little more about the butterflies. They even offered to take some pics for you. The rooms with fish and other animal exhibits were pretty cool. We really liked the bee exhibit. That was pretty cool. It's a fun place to spend an afternoon."}
{"text":"I loved this place so much so I decided to take my niece this weekend for her birthday. Everything was fine until we got into the aquarium area. They have a stingray pool, we walked in and I could hear someone talking with instructions, but it was packed so it was hard to pay attention let alone hear, especially with kiddos running around and trying to get everyone situated and such. We got up to the pool, I stuck my hand in to touch a stingray, probably up to about my elbow and the instructor, who was in the room on a MIC (I had no idea!) SCREAMED at me!! \"We don't do that! We don't stick our arms in the pool! Ma'am! You! You in the pink! WE DON'T DO THAT!!\" Shaking her finger even and pointing at me.  It was absolutely and utterly embarrassing, especially in a room full of people and she carried on entirely too long about it. Another woman next to my sister was even making comments to her husband about how rude she was and that she clearly needs a new job. I understand if I did something wrong, but the way she handled the situation was SO uncalled for. Would she have yelled at my 4 year old niece like that?? I'm an adult so I can take it, but that would be enough to send any kid running, and probably crying. What a shame!"}
{"text":"We loved it so much that we purchased annual passes. I will say though, that a one day pass is a lot of money for what you get. You can only stay in the butterfly atrium for so long. On the inside of the wonderland there are a few reptiles and fish (that's it). Now that the new aquarium is open right next door, maybe they should find something different to do with that room?! The 3D movie is amazing, and never seems to get old.  I do like that they have special events like painting and yoga within the wonderland (at an extra cost). It is super relaxing and mesmerizing to walk through the atrium. I'm glad I purchased the annual pass."}
{"text":"Got to visit Butterfly Wonderland June 30th 2015 with a 9 year old, 11 Year old, 16, 18 and 19 year old. Everyone enjoyed their visit. The 3D movie at the beginning of the tour was just the right length. Informative and visually stimulating. The Stingray display was a big high point for the young ones. Even my 16 year old daughter was all smiles because you are allowed to let the stingray touch your hand. The Butterfly Atrium was beautiful. I sometimes forgot to watch the sidewalk, the butterflies sit on the sidewalk sometimes. So we moved slowly and some of the butterflies landed on people. The Mirror Maze next door was exciting for the kids. Trying to figure out how to get out was fun for all of us. That's ages 9-43. Hahahahahaha"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and my wife and I loved it. The second trip we made out we brought our 10 month old daughter and she enjoyed it from the movie to the nature environment she loved every moment. We will gladly return the next time we're in Arizona."}
{"text":"It's. the place I go to get 'at peace with the world'. All sorts of varieties, every visit is different. Going earlier in the day is better, the butterflies bare more awake and active.  You'll get great photos and video. I recommend a longer pass, you'll want to come back. Some great foods and stores behind it. I have not been to the aquarium ye so I can't speak to it.   They also have some cool talks and classes. (Yes I teach one of those). As it gets humid in the butterfly area you can go in and out of it. They have a small stingray pond as well as other fish and some cool insects."}
{"text":"So many times I've passed by here and was not even remotely interested in going in until my girlfriend took me here on a weekend outing. This was so fun. The outdoor area where the butterflies fly free was amazing. So many beautiful butterflies and they will land on you if you don't mind and walk around with you. A really amazing experience. I'm just sorry I didn't go one of those times I passed by."}
{"text":"My fiancé loves this place! You can buy combo tickets to visit the Odysea Aquarium and this location for a cheaper fee than it would be to purchase admission to both places. Great information on butterflies."}
{"text":"The 3D movie was good. A little expensive for such a small place. Took only about an hour and a half to go through it."}
{"text":"I came here today with my mom at around 11:30 for the first time. The place was easy to find and parking wasn't an issue. It was pretty busy but not too bad to where I wouldn't not want to go in. The prices are a little high though. For two adult tickets it was $41. Which is high just to see butterflies. Right when you walk in you don' really even know where to go. There a gift shop and just a service desk. Go to the service desk where they'll check your tickets. You have to see a about 10 minute long movie which is 3-D before you enter to see the butterflies. Since the movie didn't start right away when we got there they said we could go see the aquarium first to wait. We walked down the hallway and only saw the movie theatre inside. No aquarium. They didn't even ask if we knew where it was or not. There was no signs. Nothing. We walked back to the service desk and asked where the aquarium was. The said it was through two doors that only have a sign that says 'Please open slowly'. You would think the sign would say 'Aquarium' maybe or at least something?? Besides that the aquarium is pretty cool. It's not that big though. There is a eating spot but the prices were too high. The movie is cool though and goes by fast. The butterfly greenhouse is amazing though. It's very very hot and humid inside so I recommend either bringing a water or drinking a lot before going in!"}
{"text":"Our first experience was back in August. We came here in honor of our baby girl who passed away and we happened to call her our \"Baby Butterfly\". We needed a healing experience and this was the perfect place. We drove 5 hours from Las Vegas just to visit this beautiful, enchanting place.  We had such a wonderful time, I wanted to call personally to thank the staff and compliment them. We happened to speak to the executive director and told him our reason for coming and thanked him for a great time. He was so touched that he promised to take extra care of the butterflies in our baby's honor.  I don't even know how to call that great \"customer service\" because it was so much more than that. We were treated like family.  With an experience like that, we just had to come back. I emailed Mr. Fox to say how excited we were to return.  We arrived yesterday and we greeted by him. He surprised us with bringing us into the conservatory to release a batch of butterflies for their first flight in honor of my baby girl.  Tears rolled down my face...  Butterfly Wonderland knows the true meaning of treating their guests like family.  The entire experience, Was unforgettable, both times and we plan to return soon since we are now lifetime members."}
{"text":"Another placeholder so my pictures link. I'll update with details later, but the 4 star rating holds true."}
{"text":"For the price, this was disappointing. Yes the butterfly area was cool but we spent only an hour in the facility total and there was nothing left for us to do- sad we wasted part of our vacation here instead of just chillin' at the pool."}
{"text":"What a magical place! Butterflies galore! You really feel like you're in a secret garden. The film presentation was educational. The food was good too! The store had a great selection of gifts. The kids and the grand kids had a great time each and every time we have come to visit the butterflies."}
{"text":"Great place to bring the kids or if you're a photographer!  Be prepared however fir 2 things..... no strollers allowed in the butterfly sanctuary although allowed in the aquarium and reptile exhibits and 80% humidity inside the sanctuary.  I liked it but some may not.  Nice cafe' and gift shop also!  Not inexpensive but not crazy either!"}
{"text":"Eh- the lay out is horrible! I hate going places and the second I get there is to watch a movie. Then you're shuffled out and into the atrium. The atrium is pretty much the whole part of the experience. After the atrium is the cafe you have to cross into and then the small room of aquatic animals.   I don't like how there is no reason to bring a stroller cuz there is no stroller room in the theater and u can't bring in the atrium- basically no need to bring a stroller.   $7 for a sandwich- the cafe is overpriced.   The only had one stingray to pet.. The other zoos have lots!!   I have to work my way through this maze back to the lobby and cross over the green screen of people taking pictures to use the restroom!"}
{"text":"My first time in this palace of knowledge was amazing. Wonderful staff, beautiful exhibits , and future plans that are amazing! I think kids of all ages can get a lot out of this indoor experience. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place, but I was so disappointed.  *Way too expensive! We spent less than 2 hours and we had seen it all...$19 for adult $10 for kids.  *3D movie was the best part, but it is only 15 minutes. *The Emergence Gallery was so crowded it was difficult to get up to the windows.  *The Garden is pretty and humid. The butterflies are everywhere! But for the price of one day here I can buy my family annual admission to the Botanical Gardens and see the butterflies often and learn more about them and do the annual Monarch tagging.  *The ant farm is a classroom science project...we were very disappointed in the size. *The bee colony was interesting and we did enjoy seeing the bees come and go.  *The fish are in wall tanks and seem like the ones you see everywhere. The sting rays are interesting to watch, but there is no place to wash hands after touching the rays...paper towels on the ledge only. *The only restroom is in the front lobby. You must walk through the gift shop to wash hands or bathroom the children...There is no way to avoid the gift shop to get to the restrooms...difficult with small children.   The concept of an indoor Butterfly Wonderland is great, unfortunately the reality did not seem like a Wonderland. Our family won't be back. This is not a good value for the money."}
{"text":"I'm writing my review mostly based on the customer experience aspect of my visit here with that being said they should really find some new employees everyone here acts and looks like they hate their job. It's defiantly overpriced in my opinion but I do understand that they have to upkeep the atrium at a very humid level so for a one time experience whatever. You can probably view this entire place in about 30 min. They have a neat 3D film on butterflies which was cool but kinda gross that they reuse the glasses I guess they steam clean them But still gross. As far the positive aspects the butterflies were beautiful and everywhere many different species you have to watch where you walk because a lot  Just stay on the floors . A tip for those with babies . Strollers are not aloud in the butterfly area which is a huge inconvenience for some . It's very humid in here so I recommend going when it's cooler I went on a day it was 110 not the best idea lol :) overall it was Fun to bring my daughter and son there for a play date with friends. I am excited to see the aquarium exhibit they are building I will defiantly be going to see that."}
{"text":"We went there on a Wednesday morning and there were a lot of people there -- mostly class trip kids. So we were off to a slow start waiting for the 3D movie and did not have an option to bypass it since there were so many people ahead of us. So, between the 20 minute wait for the movie and the 15 minute movie itself (which I must say was very enjoyable) that was the downside.  The upside started in the butterfly emergence gallery where you could chrysalises in varying stages of development including newly developed butterflies. The only problem here is you are coming into a relatively small room from the larger theater so unless you are the lucky first out of the theater you will be waiting for the viewing wall. (Even though we were part of the lucky I would say the wall is worth the wait)  From there you go into what they describe as America's largest butterfly atrium. Well, I have never experienced anything like it. Large indeed but more amazingly there were butterflies EVERYWHERE. You certainly did not need to look for them and yes, they do land on you as well. Surprisingly the class trips we saw were very well behaved in the atrium. I think it is just the magic of being in a place so different than anything you have ever experienced elsewhere."}
{"text":"Coming from Wisconsin this was an awesome  amazing experience. My daughter absolutely loved being able to interact with the butterflies."}
{"text":"Visited mid week so small crowd and lots of room to walk and and enjoy the atrium. Fun because it's different  - not your normal way to pass the time.  Friendly and knowledgable staff, clean facility, organized exhibits and  centrally located right off the 101. We had no idea we would be able to touch the manta rays, watch ants farm and check out some bees and fish on top of the butterfly experience. It's pretty much a one time visit for me - but I'm glad I knocked it off my list of things to so. My favorite is the \"butterfly body check\" you need to undergo leaving the atrium. They search for stowaways. Lol"}
{"text":"So worth the visit. It's a maybe 30 -60 minute visit. The 3D movie was 12 minutes was a great show on how the butterflies migrate . The actual interaction was relaxing. If you have a toddler maybe not appropriate. The toddlers on the atrium ruined my visit as they ran and screamed during my visit. They should have a toddler time"}
{"text":"Take my word and eat somewhere besides the cafe here. The \"manager\" of the cafe is downright rude and incapable of completing a task as simple as making 2 pretzels with cheese. She completely forgot my order then tried to blame her \"employee\" (her words) for her incompetence. They are microwaved for goodness sake! She didn't even try to fake an apology. I work in the service industry, this woman seriously needs to find a new line of work. No managerial skills what so ever. I cannot fathom how she got this job or how she has managed to keep it."}
{"text":"*Customer Service 1/2 Stars, As for this it was nothing special but not bad either. Did however see one lady that was working here looking and talking to people negatively when they try and get a butterfly on their finger.   *Experience 1/1 Star, been here multiple times and I have a good time. Went during the week and early in the morning to avoid the crowds so it was even more enjoyable.   *Activity 1/1 Star, you can never go wrong with having hundreds of butterflies doing their thing and fluttering their wings all around you. Also with the occasional ones that land on you hitching a ride around.  *Would I Recommend 1/1 Star, absolutely would recommend  you give this place a try. Lots of fun and especially if you had children."}
{"text":"NOT a place for toddlers and young kids. So, you think 'butterflies'.. that's a 'little kid' thing??   It really isn't for small children and especially for how expensive it is.  It's a crime for this place to charge what they do for parents to bring in small kids who one: will never remember this place and two:  can't behave well enough to be there.  There were three different parents who had to take their '5 and under' children out during the movie.  It's an educational film.  The other small kids who remained were obnoxious- talking WAY out loud as though they were in their living rooms. But kids 2 and under are free.  I have no idea why they are actually encouraging parents to bring kids this young.    It's obnoxiously expensive for what it is.  Yes, the butterfly atrium is cool... but MANY butterflies on the path, and I saw three murdered by small children not watching where they were going, and they just tromped right on 'em.  Not worth the almost TWENTY dollars for an adult.  The aquarium part is nothing beyond something you see in your dentist's office.  All of the Mini stingrays were lying on the bottom of their tank and the guy said, \"Oh, they're nocturnal\".  Really?  They aren't at the zoo... and if they actually are then why put them in an exhibit open during the DAY?   Be prepared for the almost 'Hitchcock' feel of the butterfly atrium.  If this type of thing creeps you out, steer clear.  This is NOT like the Botanical garden butterfly exhibit where butterflies are sitting mostly on plants.   These are flying all over the place.  Cool to some- creepy to others.    So, long story short- take an international student whose never seen a butterfly OR a special older person who can appreciate the process, can read the exhibits and can enjoy the beauty that this small place offers.    I can't believe I just spent almost 80.00 for a family of four for about 90 minutes of somewhat interesting activity.    I can't imagine this place lasting at these prices. Although, it was very crowded- so, who am I to say."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Truly a treat for us on our trip from CA to AZ. the staff was so kind, the butterflies were gorgeous and the baby quails were adorable. Thank you for a great morning adventure!!"}
{"text":"Kind of a random structure out in the middle of the desert.   When it was being built, we all were wondering what was being erected off of the 101 in such a peculiar spot.  Still looks a bit odd standing out there surrounded by...nothing.  I suppose in 10 years, we might look back and say, \"remember when the Butterfly Wonderland was the only thing on that plot of land?\"  Anyhow, despite the high prices, this is a nice little spot to visit once (probably any more than one visit, and you'll quickly bore).  We watched the introductory 3D butterfly movie twice -- it actually really is that good, and that entertaining...and quite informative.  The next exhibit room features butterflies that are just starting to crack out of their cocoons.  The larger species are fascinating!  The actual butterfly room is more fun than you would think, chiefly because most folks like us play a little game of, \"how still can I stand so that a butterfly lands on me.\"  I had 4 at one time...not too shabby.  This is a good spot to take the family on one of those hot summer days when you have nothing else to do, or when you have family in town."}
{"text":"This a great place for all ages. We really enjoyed the fantastic 3D video intro about the Monarch butterfly. There are many beautiful butterflies to see up close in a natural environment. Also there is a bee hive which bees are able to go outside, collect pollen, and return. The queen is visible. There is a wonderful aquarium with fish swimming around and touchable! The best!!!! Thanks for co I g to Scottsdale. Anyone want to volunteer there with me?"}
{"text":"LOCATION/PARKING:  Right off the 101. Easy, free parking.  THINGS TO DO: There is a big butterfly house, a stingray petting tank, some fish tanks, a few insect exhibits, an informative and beautiful 15 minute 3D movie, an impressive gift shop, and a small no frills cafe.  The butterfly house is great! Very large, well maintained, relaxing, and even plays gentle music in the background. The butterflies are beautiful and there are never-ending opportunities for taking some beautiful photos!   The 3D movie is fun- be prepared for kids squealing.  It is beautifully done and provides a good bit of information about monarchs and their migration to/from Mexico.   The other exhibits are pretty weak, but well maintained and you can see the potential.   VALUE: Sort of on the pricey side (about $18 admission, includes everything; cheaper for kids/seniors) but is enjoyable.   NOTEWORTHY:  Be careful not to step on a butterfly!!  FINAL VERDICT: I would recommend a stop here. Perfect place for a family outing, a date, a solo trip to see something different, a casual day trip for friends.  If you are okay with the idea of spending money to walk among butterflies, I can safely say that you would enjoy it here."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! It's small but worth the trip. Very relaxing and beautiful, how cool to be surrounded with 2500k butterflies at one time! It was like being in a cartoon. Kid friendly but fun for adults too."}
{"text":"I went to Butterfly Wonderland on Saturday...What a LOVELY experience! Hundreds and hundreds of butterflies large and small and every color of the rainbow and more are flying freely around the enclosure and landing on any and everyone there...what a mesmerizing sight...everyone had smiles on their faces, all ages of folks dressed in all sorts of garb...so relaxing...I'd definitely go back, my Mom was over the moon...it was incredible...I would suggest that before going in you take a good look at your children and decide if they're ready to venture into such a place because there is NO TOUCHING of the butterflies, let alone SCREAMING AND RUNNING AND SWATTING AT THEM...I was shocked by parents who just drug their children in without any concern about what their reaction would be! I was mortified as were all the adults around me (except their parents)...other than that, it was a WONDERFUL DAY and I'd recommend this experience to EVERYONE that would like to enjoy a steamy afternoon enjoying the beauty of nature...KUDOS DEE...We'll be back! Go Buckeyes:)"}
{"text":"Great place to take your kids, grandkids & nieces or nephews. The butterflies and quite entertaining and beautiful. Really enjoyed taking photos of the butterflies landing on us and enjoyed watching them interact with other butterflies."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful experience for the whole family! I will say it's a little pricey for just an hour or two, but getting to be right in the midst of so many gorgeous butterflies made it worth it.   Side note is that some of the younger kiddos, like toddler age are scared for the butterflies to land on them."}
{"text":"Nice opportunity to see butterflies up close but not personally worth the price at $20 per adult. Stingray touch tank and fish tanks are also a slight step above visiting a pet store. Better off spending your money at the Phoenix Zoo. I'd rate this as 4-5 star if the attraction were priced more fairly at $12-15 per adult given that you'll probably only spend two hours at this venue. It's basically a commercial tourist trap to make money off of nature. I'm expecting the OdySea Aquarium to be much if the same. Save your money and visit a real nature preserve.  Also, they don't let you feed butterflies as we've seen at other butterfly exhibits and have tight rules (compared to most other aquariums and the Phoenix Zoo) when touching the stingrays. You basically put up to two knuckles in the water and let them swim up to you whereas at the Phoenix Zoo, you can actually feed them shrimp and pet their backs which is more of a true touch tank experience. The only upside to the \"touch tank\" is that the water is still enough to take photos of the stingrays (when they're swimming) because there's so little action (kids reaching in the water, too many rules about touching the stingrays) that you can actually get photos of them swimming by."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it is very nice. In reading through some of the reviews on Yelp it's pretty clear that some folks thought this would be a Disney theme park for their children to play in.  It is not. If you are looking for a fun day with your kids, take them to the zoo where they can run around and express some of their energy.   Butterflies are fragile creatures and they live only a week or two so naturally the staff can't let little Susie and Billy chase them around and grab them by the wings. To be honest, most kids are bored stiff after 10 or 15 minutes. This place is really geared to adults in my opinion.   Upon entering, you may choose to see a 3D movie about the migration of the Monarch butterfly. The movie lasts 15 minutes and it's worth the time. You can then proceed into an area where there are many cocoons and chrysalises. You may be as lucky as we were and you'll get to see a butterfly come out of their chrysalis. It was pretty epic!  You then go into the atrium and walk among the butterflies, listen to beautiful music and simply enjoy the beauty of nature.   I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I found the small stingray pond and introductory aquarium to be too small to enjoy so it felt like an after thought. Not a deal breaker for me, but it's something I'd just walk on by next time I go.   In my view, $20 is fair for the experience they are providing. It costs some bucks to support a place where the displayed creatures die every other week."}
{"text":"This place is so cool and a fun place to take the kids especially when it is so hot outside here in the valley. We spent the day with our kids here and learned more about butterflies. They took a picture of all of us when we walked in. It was sort of pricey for all of us to go and I was expecting the picture they took to be given to us at the end. However I understand they are running a business I was just under the impression they would by how they approached us in the beginning.  They have a little area to eat and they have a 3D movie before you go in to the area to see the butterflies. Our oldest daughter was a little afraid of the butterflies which I didn't see coming and it was humid in the butterfly area, again because it needs to be for the butterflies and little birds they have there. I loved having the butterflies land on me and taking pictures there. All the employees were really nice and the gift shop at the end had a lot of cool stuff to buy however once again slightly expensive. It was expected based on my experience with going to the zoo in the past. I would love to go back sometime for sure."}
{"text":"We went here on Christmas Day and it was wonderful. The staff is helpful and cheery and the butterflies were so beautiful to see up close.  My daughter is 7 and she did get slightly irked at the butterflies flying so close to her and even landing on her so I think a little prep for your kids is in order if they are  squeamish about bugs.  I loved this place and will definitely be visiting soon."}
{"text":"I visited Butterfly Wonderland twice. It's right next to the aquarium. It's very educational, and I enjoyed the 3D film! The butterflies are beautiful (they have so many flying around, the blues are my favorites) but I do wish they'd put up signs to remind people to watch where they step. The butterflies land on the ground, and people forget to watch for them. The gift shop is very nice!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family and didn't know what to expect. The 3D movie was entertaining and quite informative. What was really cool was seeing the chrysalis of the butterflies and moths arranged by species. The main butterfly atrium was really special. It was awesome to see and be in an area with butterflies flying and gliding all around. Some even landed and rested on our shoulders and arms!  Highly recommend checking out Butterfly Wonderland. Very unique and we enjoyed all the new knowledge we gleaned from this experience."}
{"text":"The actual exhibit is amazing.  The conservatory obviously, is the best part. It was difficult for anyone in or group actually wanting to leave! We just wanted to sit there and enjoy the experience! It was definitely crowded. However I could tolerate that. What honestly ruins the experience is having to see parents that obviously are too obsessed with taking selfies, and letting their children run around and stomp on the butterflies.  The workers in the conservatory also did not actually seem to care about the butterflies much at all. (At least that I saw).  Again, another wonderful experience, if you can tolerate the people or go at a time when it's not very crowded."}
{"text":"What do you get when you cross a bunch of butterflies with a dream? Why yes, you're absolutely correct: Butterfly Wonderland. I can describe my visit to the largest Butterfly atrium in America but it definitely won't do enough justice. Butterfly Wonderland isn't hard to find at all. It's right off the 101 and you'll see it coming off the exit. Parking is ample and there are ticket windows up front for entrance.   When you enter, there are a couple of employees to greet you-one to check your ticket stubs and one to take your picture with the beautiful butterfly backdrop. You are then escorted to the theater to watch a 3-D documentary on the life cycle of a butterfly (don't worry; it won't put you to sleep). After the film, you are pretty much free to explore the atrium. Directly outside of the theater were displays of caterpillars in their cocoons. I wasn't planning on staying long but I actually lost track of time in the atrium. They did a great job with the whole \"wonderland illusion\" of the atrium. Besides the butterflies, beautiful plants, trees, waterfalls and ponds fill the atrium. All the while, they have fairytale-like music playing overhead really softly which pretty much does the trick on the \"wonderland\" ambiance.   There are soooo many different types of butterflies and I could literally spend hours there. Visitors should be careful while walking around the atrium-butterflies land everywhere so there were a bunch of them on the ground. I was lucky enough to have a pretty little white butterfly land on my shoulder. The song \"Butterfly on Her Shoulder\" immediately started playing in my head (Hawaii locals, you know this one)!  Butterfly Wonderland also has a cute café and a gift shop. The café had a pretty simple menu and items were overpriced. The gift shop on the other hand, was far from simple and had a ton of souvenirs to offer but yes, overpriced as well.   Bottom line: just go! Butterfly Wonderland isn't just for pretty little princesses either, it's for the entire family and adults alone. In fact, if you're having a rough day or are under stress, I highly recommend going. There's just something about the atmosphere that is really calming. Not to mention, it really puts into perspective that things do change and things do get better over time. \"If nothing ever changed, there'd be no butterflies.\""}
{"text":"An exciting place to see beautiful different species of butterflies. The 15 minute 3D video about Monarch butterflies was informative and enjoyable. You then enter into a room with a few cases of emerging butterflies and it was actually very cool to see all the different types of chrysalis. The atrium is full of a butterflies that fly all around you. For the butterflies comfort, the room is extremely humid and hot so don't expect to spend too much time in there before melting. You then see a small display of ants and bees and then fish and sting rays. There is also a little cafe, but I did not eat there. Overall, I think the place is something to check out once, but nothing to rush to. However, I thought it was way over priced. I paid the $16.95 student fee, which came to $18 with tax, $10 would have been more reasonable. You only spend an hour there before you're ready to leave (and really you could see it all in 30 minutes if you really wanted to). The staff member in the fish room couldn't tell us anything and was googling things for us, which we could have done ourselves. He said he normally works in the butterfly area, so maybe we just went at the wrong time. I thought there would be more information about the different species and more displays of butterflies in frames."}
{"text":"This Woo Hoo is specifically for the excellent customer service we received. It is spring break and we grandmas decided to take a trip to Butterfly Wonderland. We had all kinds of stuff going on from, children/student, senior discounts, AAA, to $ off coupons. Martha, the Retail Manager was so helpful, kind, patient and understanding she helped us get the best price for the combination Butterfly/Mirror/Laser exhibits. This woohoo is for Martha from a grateful grandma. The Woohoo is also for an overall great time. The Butterflies are serene and the mirror, laser exhibit is very cool and all age appropriate (parents should accompany toddlers the mirrors are amazing!)"}
{"text":"Everyone must go.  Young and old.  Friendly, qualified staff makes the difference.  Gorgeous facility.  It takes about 2 hours to enjoy."}
{"text":"There's not a whole lot of indoor activities to do in Phoenix besides shopping and museums, so when this Butterfly Wonderland opened up, I was really excited!  Plus I'm a huge animal freak.  So we went, and butterfly enclosure was nice and big and had lots of butterflies and the video was interesting.  BUT Here's why I only gave it 3 stars:  - Located in the middle of nowhere.  Be prepared for a 45-min. drive if coming from Peoria or Glendale - Confusing admission lines.  Due to the 100+ degree weather, they re-directed the line from the outdoor ticket stands to the indoor gift shop check-out counter.  What resulted was a confused mass of people standing around in the gift shop not realizing that some lines were credit card only.  Why they put the ticket counters outside in the first place is a mystery. - Butterfly enclosure was torturously humid.  Combine that with the fact that you're basically in a greenhouse, and you've got one sweaty, uncomfortable lady here.  It was too hard to enjoy the plants, flowers, and butterflies with buckets of sweat pouring off my face.  We had to leave the greenhouse so I could recover before going back out to see more butterflies. - Expensive admission for the amount of stuff you get to see.  Besides the butterfly greenhouse, there's really only a 3D butterfly movie, a cocoon nursery, and an ant farm to look at."}
{"text":"Though I love so much of what Butterfly Wonderland has to offer, they simply MUST do something about the pervasive smell of sewage that greets you the moment you walk in the door and in other parts of the building (also outside near the parking lot). I won't be going back until I hear they've solved this awful smell and whatever is causing it."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place less than a 3 star review.  I am giving it this because the cost-to-experience ratio is skewed.  This place, in my opinion is not worth $19 Adult and $9 for kids.  You can also spend more and see a light show and some other things.  My opinion would be to visit the butterfly exhibit at the Desert Botanical Garden.  You spend about 4 or 5 dollars more, but you can have the same butterfly experience AND tour the beautiful garden.    I could not make the connect in this place between the amazon fish and the butterflies.  I guess the fact that the conservatory is like a rain forest... so the Amazon is in a rain forest, so include fish in this exhibit.  Ok.  I got it.  not really.  I could understand the stretch to include the bees, but I could not understand why they included ants, scorpions and spiders.  There may have been posted signs to explain, but I don't recall seeing why these creatures were at Butterfly Wonderland.  It seems to me as though, at the last minute they decided to throw in some sharks and fish and some bugs to help extend the exhibit.  Furthermore, their guides/employees are not as helpful or informative as the DBG Butterfly exhibit.   I would have expected guides to be walking around and basically talking to people to share the information, like in other butterfly conservatories I've visited.    The 3 bright spots were the 3D film and the butterfly conservatory ...  because of the butterflies AND the wonderful climate-controlled humidity of the rain-forest like atmosphere.  Oh how I loved that humidity.  I didn't want to leave.  Don't be silly and wear jeans or you'll be very hot.  The 3rd bright spot was certainly the Butterfly emergence... watch butterflies emerge from their chrysalises (some of them look like piece of jewelry!) and spread their wings for the first time.  AMAZING show right there.  Perhaps this place is worth a one-time visit.  For me I wish I had saved my money."}
{"text":"Hahahaha, I love reading the reviews that complain about the high humidity.  I went in August, and yes, it was muggy and uncomfortable, but I still enjoyed the experience.  I'm sure the butterflies would not appreciate having the A/C on... The place is a bit pricey, but again, a very enjoyable experience for my kids, husband and I.  My kids loved all of it, including the 3D movie.  My husband and I loved the chrysalis exhibit, i had never seen anything like it, they look like jewels!   And the actual greenhouse is not that big, true.  I expected a much, much larger place.  But nobody is kicking you out...stay and enjoy the experience.  Sit down, take pictures, ask the volunteers for information, or google it and tell your kids about it.  Reading other reviews for this place, I'd say I'm easily pleased.  I've seen better, since I've been to Costa Rica and went to a huge butterfly place.  Huge.  So this one can't compare on size...but guess what?  The Costa Rica place was hotter and muggier than this one :)"}
