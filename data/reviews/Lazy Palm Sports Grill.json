{"text":"awesome environment, cool staff.   Food were good, not the best, but good enough to enjoy."}
{"text":"I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone...even if your just looking for a place to have a drink.  The sign outside of this place says family friend and best burgers in town...that couldn't be further from the truth!  We came in and sat at the bar.  The person at the bar walks up without a smile and asks \"What do you want?\"  No emotion, no smile, no \"Hi, how are you?  How's your night? What can i help you with?  What would you like to have?\"  Maybe he had a bad night, but still no excuse for showing no hospitality.  I ask him what kind of beers do they have.  He moves aside and turns towards the direction of the beer spouts, never saying what they actually have.  We were sitting at the end of the bar and spouts were down on the other end.  Not able to clearly see what they had, i ask what is that beer with the palm tree beer spout handle.  He indicates its a lighter ale.  Wow, so informative!  So anyway we decide to order an appetizer and a burger.  We got the pretzel bites with cheese, please stay away from that!  Unless you like freezer burn pretzels and 1 year old microwave cheese!  That was not good at all.  Their best burger in town....was subpar and tasted nothing like it was described in the menu!  Maybe the food is better in the day time, but definitely not at night.    Between the poor service and bland food, you're better off going elsewhere for a better experience.  This was our first time here, and our last."}
{"text":"Great place for a good burger! I was quite surprised when the waitress brought out our food! The burgers were huge! Great presentation. The waitress accidentally ordered my burger without cheese and instantly put in a new order to the cook, they insisted on making it right! I'm glad she did because \"the hot mess\" was so yummy! The pickles were nice and crispy! Priced right."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. I want to support locally-owned small businesses. We were here for lunch today. Only one server and one cook observed working. Very understaffed. Service was slow. Four tables still needed to be bussed when we left. Overall this was a disappointing experience and we will not return."}
{"text":"I really love it here - great atmosphere, great place to watch the game - and the food was fantastic!! I ordered the mussels - really generous portion, cooked beautifully with a delicious buttery wine sauce and fresh herbs.  Served with a couple pieces of garlic bread on the side.  Also got the LP House Salad.  The chicken was grilled and tender and juicy, great flavor.  Served on top of salad with blue cheese and fresh tomatoes.  The portions are generous and definitely worth every penny.  Katie waited on us, she was super nice, knowledgeable about the menu, and gave us excellent service from beginning to end.  I see a great future ahead for this place and definitely would recommend to anyone that wants a fun, laid back place to hang out with friends, have some good food and drinks and enjoy the game!"}
{"text":"I met a friend for a beer and a burger.   Wow...the burger was huge and delicious!   The beer was cold and plenty of sports were on a bunch of televisions."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this sports bar for the first time. They have 8 big screens, plus one in the outside patio. Great Cosmos. Awesome half pound hot dog and half pound burgers. All the food we saw passing by us looked good and lots of food. Large portions and prices are decent. Our waitress was great as well. They have only been open about five weeks. They got it right and should be successful. We WILL be back."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. This bar is obviously some ex' jock-football-bro of the 80's dream of having a pub for his friends to come to. Cheap decor. Cheap tables. Everything that is served is obviously bought in bulk at Costco. They don't even put ketchup or mustard on the tables? In addition to the poor quality of food, the bar is nothing exciting whatsoever. A couple of decent craft beers among a see of domestic bud-crap. $7 for a mixed well vodka drink. I don't imagine this place staying open very long. No authenticity."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new place that is still coming together and has a lot of potential. I wouldn't say that it is not family friendly but the reality is that it is a sports bar with numerous TV's, lots of brewchachos's, good food and good service. So if you're looking for a place to watch some sports in Litchfield Park check it out. I have enjoyed it the numerous times I've been there."}
{"text":"This place is clean and the service was fine but the food was less than desirable. It didn't have much flavor and the chicken was overlooked. Too bad because we live in walking distance. Was hoping to have another local option."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place more stars because I was excited that Litchfield Park had a new sports bar but I was sorely disappointed. While the food was pretty standard for most sports bar settings, when we got there they only had one waitress working for the entire restaurant. Yes you read that right, ONE. There were about 4 girls behind the bar really not doing much of anything and the man that appeared to be the manager (I wouldn't know for sure, he never once came around and asked if we were enjoying ourselves and the food like most managers in a restaurant do) did nothing but hug the girls behind the bar and talk to the people he clearly knew. The one server, Isabella, was AMAZING all things considered. She was the only saving grace of this place. Halfway through our visit there, 3 different servers came in to start their shift, except that after clocking in they just stood off behind the bar, hugging the manager and doing nothing except for occasionally bussing a table. One girl with longer brown wavy hair just walked around looking lost and she finally decided to help run food she didn't even know what the table numbers were and almost gave the food to the wrong people!   I want to like this place and stay excited, but other than our great server, Isabella, I'm not sure we will give it another try. It was so bad that before signing and tipping the receipt we made sure to check with her that she would be the only one getting the tip and wouldn't have to split it. Unless the manager pulls his head out of his ass and does more than talk to friends and hug servers and hires some actual waitstaff - not just people who appear to be close friends -- more people like our server, I give this place a year or two tops."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I decided to try this new spot out after work. Very disappointed! We decided to grab a seat outside and enjoy what we where hoping would be the new spot. After sitting down and trying are drinks were where in disbelief the beers were lukewarm and my whiskey sour double was undrinkable. My coworkers and I are in the service industry and decided it was no big deal when we are checked on by an employee we will let them know and hopefully order some food aswell.  We waited for an 1 hour and 20 min and left. I have never been so upset with service at a barl. This would be justifiable if they where busy but there was 2 other customers it was dead. mabey next ownership will get it right."}
{"text":"Went a few times when it opened.  Only impressive item on the menu was the Hot Mess Burger.  Boneless wings tasted like Tyson frozen.  Beers are big and cheap.  Not a horrible place until they began discriminating against U of A fans.  Only offering specials to ASU fans.  Now we just cant go back.  Son was also disappointed that they removed Golf."}
{"text":"Awesome wings clean place burgers pretty good...nice place to chill and watch sports."}
{"text":"Love the place, I took my son there for lunch, the food was great, lots of nice people both working and eating at the restaurant, service was great, the food was amazing love the mussels. I liked the place so much I took my wife there the next night for dinner and drinks. We had a blast, and once again had great service.  You can tell the owners take pride in their work, the place is clean."}
{"text":"We are first timers to Lazy Palm but the staff, food, and beverages were all excellent!  This little gem will definitely become out go-to for happy hour."}
{"text":"Breakfast is awesome and I like the burgers and sandwiches for lunch.  They also have some great soups with their own recipe's.  Very relaxing, friendly atmosphere for all groups of people.     Mike C."}
{"text":"We visit the Lazy Palm a couple times a month since it's so close to our house. The kid loves the games on TV and the chicken and fries, hubs likes the fish as well as the beef dip. For me, I also like the beef deep. Good food, good service - great neighborhood bar/grill."}
{"text":"Food is good,  drinks are strong and cold.  Plenty of TV's in a very cool old venue.   Great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"So I got a bad taste in my mouth as soon as we came in from our kids soccer game....We were told to put away our gatorades and bottled water....Or we couldn't stay. I asked even if we are getting drinks, yes that's our policy. Well I felt like I was back in the 90s. So that was not our server's fault as she was just delivering the owners message . She provided great service. As far as the food, basically your average bar food. Nothing I would come back for."}
{"text":"Service is horrible!!!  The facility was filthy and stunk like old alcohol and body odor. 2 waitresses on duty, no big crowd and not even a \"be right with you\" ....nothing.  The one waitress had more of her rear end hanging out of her shorts than was covered, not that I normally mind, but this was not a sight that I think many would want to see. Never will I give a single cent to this place. Do yourself a favor and try one of the places on either side."}
{"text":"A great place for disappointment, the tacos are over rated. The $2 pints on tuseday are the only thing that saves this place"}
{"text":"Stopped by on recent trip to this area.  Very nice location and interior.  Two of us ordered burgers and fries.  Burgers were massive half pound monsters.  Very good taste and cooked properly.  Both of us really liked the fries.  Another person ordered the chicken sandwich with ham.  Same idea as the burgers.  Massive size.  She could only finish half of the sandwich and really liked it.  The last person in our party has the surf and turf. Chicken strips and some fried shrimp.  He really liked his meal.  Overall, we all enjoyed our lunch and return factor is 100 %"}
{"text":"The burgers and bloody mary's are the best in town! Everything was cooked and seasoned well. But the service was less than mediocre. Short of staff, waitress never came back once during the entire meal to inquire as to how it was or refill drinks. It took 15 minutes to get our check settled."}
{"text":"So much better than the other places that have taken this spot. The staff is professional and knowledgeable and the place isn't full of sketchy riff-raff anymore! The menu looks decent and drinks are good! Will definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and discovered this place while on a walk and checked out the menu. One regular there highly recommended the place, so we went for dinner later that week. We've gone back several times since, and it is now a regular stop for us for happy hour and dinner."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in 2 weeks ago for lunch. The place looked ok inside and out. There were some locals there talking to who I think was the manager at the end of the bar along with the bartender. She seemed nice but seemed to stay at the end of the bar yapping with the manager which I think is BS! Thought she should be more attentive to all the customers not just her boss and the few locals that were there.  The food was good really tasty, wife and I split a burger and onion rings and a few beers. Those were nice and cold.  I'll give it another try hopefully the manager won't be there so the bartender could do her job properly. I did notice that I'm not the only one who feels this way about the manager hanging out at the bar shooting the bull taking up the bartenders time.   Hopefully management reads there yelp reviews and addresses the problems with all there workers."}
{"text":"I have been to Lazy Palm a few times. Overall it is a good spot, solid food selections, cold beer and a good vibe. The burgers are one of the best in the valley. One minor issue I have is service. Tends to be slow but I will return for sure. I hope this place makes it."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for some lunch on my 30th bday and we were pleasantly surprised. My husband and I ordered the lobster bloody Mary's which were delicious!!  We then ordered a couple of beers which were ice cold. Our kids ordered the kids cheeseburger and we had them split it for us which to our surprise they came out in separate baskets with plenty of fries for each of them! I ordered the governor burger which was the one with peanut butter. I added bacon which made it that much better. My husband ordered the big Geno which was amazing, we split our burgers. The prices are great for the amount of food you get. The onion rings and fries are seasoned nicely. Also, we tried a sample of the evil sauce and holy moly it's hella Spicy! I love spicy and this sauce is no joke. Our server was Dion, she was sweet and efficient. Chuck is the chef and that man can cook some bomb food. All in all we will be back to try some more good food and have some bomb bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"We stopped by the Lazy Palm since the Park Cafe next door was packed for Fathers Day. Service was very slow, Bloody Mary was good, but after waiting over 30 minutes for an order of pancakes and 3 thick cut strips of bacon- disappointed!  The bacon was not thick cut & over cooked-received 2 strips and a crumb! Think we'll try this place again since it's close-hoping for a better experience as a bar- not for breakfast."}
{"text":"I just came in for my first time and I love this place. So I'm currently out here in Litchfield for work and I some how found this gem. Christa the bartender took great care of me.  She made my visit in Litchfield great.  Thanks Christa for the friendly and great service. She makes the bar."}
{"text":"My wife had been begging me to come here as she's wanted to hit all the little Wigwam Restaurants. Finally we came and I have officially put his restaurant on the family BANNED list! We walked in and nobody acknowledged us or told us if we seat ourselves or what we do. Multiple servers walked by us and didn't even greet us. We finally sat outside on the dirty table and waited at least 15 mins before our drink order was taken. We were ready to leave so many times, but we were committed now and I at least wanted to try the food. The waitress did say she was sorry and that they were understaffed. I usually don't take into account the one off negative reviews, but they were all consistent with the really bad service. This is an UNDERSTATEMENT, as the service is horrendous. Okay so finally the food came and...... the buns were cold for the burgers and the bacon I ordered was left off. Hey the sweet potato fries were good. Okay, please don't come here unless you have amazing patience. I should have went to Whataburger down the street."}
{"text":"Terrible place to eat. The owner of restaurant took our reservation for over 25 people and neglected to tell us he only had 1 chef/2 waitress. With the \"existing customers\" in the restaurant plus our party; many members of our party WAITED 2 1/2 hours for a burger. We asked the waitress to at least ask the manger/or owner if we could at least get our drinks comp or all the sodas/few beers BUT she couldn't ask him because he had left the restaurant as they ran out of supplies. I asked her if she could call him-but she was so overwhelmed and inpatient with the situation; she said she couldn't. It wasn't our fault that we all wanted to have burgers and each of us wanted to eat. The fact that they only had one chef isn't our fault either. The waitress was unapologetic to us. She Made it seem like it was our fault. The owner/manager saw dollar signs when he took our reservation, knowing full well he wasn't properly staffed. Surely he must've known and realized that he didn't have enough supplies. Our boys played a hard day of baseball in the heat, we are in town for the JO's and the majority of our party who waited over 2 hrs for a burgers were the boys. We would have been better off at a pizza place watching the College World Series."}
{"text":"Look at the Bloody Mary! Only $10! Food is really good here.  Fries are the best! Very comfortable in here too. They have tv's and full bar."}
{"text":"Hmmm....good burgers but definitely order it more rare than you want it. The onion rings and ranch are very fast food-y.  I love the neighborhood resort feel and I would definitely come back but I wouldn't say it's the best place to get a burger. I came for the peanut butter burger but it was a little disappointing. I'm dying to try their whiskey burger!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the beer is cold and the staff is always polite and helpful. Also, you can't beat taco Tuesday!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, as was the service.  Beer selection is pretty limited and I am a craft beer guy, so that was the one thing that could have been improved upon."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. The hamburger is huge and taste and the chicken fingers is good as well. The games are always on and the customer service is always good."}
{"text":"Coincidentally, the Lazy Palm Sports Grill is next door to the Park Cafe, which was the last restaurant I reviewed. Also located in the heart of Litchfield Park, this new sports grill occupies the space that was formerly just a bar. Albeit, a very nice bar. Obviously, the atmosphere is different. The music being piped in was enjoyable, but the live music is missed.  Regardless, the Lazy Palm is a sports grill and it features upscale bar food. There is a green theme here that is hard to miss. The south wall is painted (almost entirely) chartreuse. Look it up. Think, anti-freeze, or Mountain Dew. The logo and the staff's shirts are also this vibrant shade of green. And as offensive as that sounds, it's not.  And when you have a server who is as interesting, funny and perky as Nichole, you almost forget about the colors. Nichole timed everything perfectly, checked back just often enough and was a pleasure to talk to. Plus, she made some great suggestions.  The menu is simple. But there is plenty of variety. My girlfriend suggested the Lazy Palm because of the burgers. For starters, we devoured the Jalapeño Poppers which featured the usual chili pepper, cream cheese and breading. But these also included bacon and a delicious dipping sauce. They disappeared to quickly to photograph.  And then there was the burger. I can't remember the name, but it features 1/2 lb of beef, Swiss cheese, pastrami, a fried egg, lettuce, onion and tomato. And holy cow... I can't remember the last time I wasn't able to finish a burger. This is one generous burger! And boy was it tasty! One of the best burgers I've ever tried!  Litchfield Park now features some very good restaurants with a lot of variety. And it's just walking distance from so many homes. The Lazy Palm is an excellent addition to the mix."}
{"text":"Numerous tvs? Apparently some people haven't been to a real sports bars with tons of tvs. Food was decent and serving sizes pretty fair, but the a-hole who seemed to be the manager/owner seemed to feel he was far more important than the paying customers. Even gave the place a 2nd try since it was so close to where l lived. Same crap. King sh*t would rather get attention from his pretty help than let them serve his customers.  NEVER going back until this idiot is long gone. Might not even go back after that."}
{"text":"The reason why I give them 4* is the food[ i wish i could 5*]. Service! ? They should be more responsible for the job and direct costumers where to go . We saw 2 couples came inside and left without nobody talking to them.   The food was great. And the presentation was on the line. Good job the kitchen.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"WOW!  These people are amazing, we were at a conference at the Wigwam and people wanted to keep the party going after our closing event.  We walked over to the bar and most of our conference ended up following us.  What we thought we be 15 people coming in at 11:30 turned into filling up the entire bar with close to 70 people.  They graciously kept the bar open took really good care of our group.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I'll Be Back  Lazy Palm Sports Bar and Grill is a casual place to hang out with family, friends, or to just sit back, and enjoy a few drinks and good food. You can't tell from the outside but Lazy Palm is large, with plenty of seating, and enough standing room, without having to get to close to the dinning table area.  The staff at Lazy Palm are friendly and the service is prompt.  Lazy Palm's offers a great selection of brews on tap and a great selection of burgers, sandwiches, salads, wing, etc. The Philly cheese steak, fish taco,  and sliders,  were absolutely delicious, and the prices are wallet friendly.  Great food, drinks, prices, and customer service.  What more can you ask for.  If you're in the area give Lazy Palm's Sports Bar and  Grill a try, you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Great place! Can't wait to go back next time I'm visiting AZ .  The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great service and all around good people. The Tower of Onion rings we're perfect with an  LP draft! I plan on going back for the rest of the menu and of course, the beer. Had a good time, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We have been there twice in the last two weeks and really love the feel, the coldest beer and the great food! Enjoy the banter with the bartender and the patrons, wish it was in my neighborhood because I would be a regular. I'll be bringing family and friends when they come to visit because I know they will have a great time with quality food!"}
{"text":"Hailey was awesome.  We had drinks and appetizers and dinner. The Irish Nachos were awesome. The jalapeño poppers not so much.  Boneless wings were good. Did I say Hailey was awesome? Roast beef dip , chicken sandwich,  Italian sandwich... All good. Bloody Mary was yummy too.  We really enjoyed.   Looked forward to going back...in about 2 years when I am hungry again."}
{"text":"O. M. G. Pastrami burger to die for! 5 stars alone just for that. Great location, service a little slow, but I would wait 10 hours for this burger!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this place when we pulled up but it really surprised me with the quality of drinks and food coming from the bar and kitchen.    It's definitely a dive but the servers and bartenders are really friendly and the drinks were continuously filled and food was satisfying.    They're known for their burgers which my husband got.  In fact, I failed to take any pictures because we were so hungry but here's what the table of 4 got:  Jalapeño poppers which was not your traditional popper.   It was a ball of cream cheese with bacon and jalapeño bits then breaded and deep fried.  Good but very different.  We had a couple of baskets of chicken fingers which were piping hot but really good.  Their honey mustard was tangy and sweet and the fries stayed hot the entire time and addictive.  My husband's cheeseburger was enormous but the giant finished every single bite.    Definitely out of place in that neighborhood but so worth it to chill out with friends, tv and drinks."}
{"text":"We had the special turkey BLT W with potato salad, the Cluckinator and a bacon cheeseburger. It was all excellent and the service was great. We will be back for more and a Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"This was our second time here and we were not disappointed. They have a chorizo egg Benedict (only Saturday and Sunday) and it is a must! My boyfriend ordered their breakfast burrito and also super flavorful! Lastly their mimosas are perfect! Overall a good experience, good food, and great service! Thanks to our server Michael for being so attentive and personable. Just a small suggestion to the kitchen... do not use the same knife to cut cilantro/onion to cut the fruit please."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service can be terrible.  My last two visits sealed it for me.   I came in off peak hours and there was only two others at the bar.  We watched the bartender eat her lunch with her back to us.  When she finished, I paid my bill and left her a well deserved $.42 tip.  I went again off peak hours and there was only 3 people at the bar.  I guess she remembered my $.42 tip.  I sat for 7-8 minutes without so much as an acknowledgement from her.  I just left.  I guess they think they are the only place that sells beer and hamburgers in the West Valley.  I never used it, but the bathroom has been reported to me by two people as being so rank it could gag a maggot.  If you just have to eat there, bring a good book and have time to kill."}
{"text":"Love this place, wife and I come here all the time. Huge fan of the burgers here. Service is a little slow but I'll wait for better food."}
{"text":"You have to try the Jalapeno poppers! The breakfast burger is amazing and will have you coming back for more. The servers seem slammed but they do check on you which is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best place in town to go and chill - live the atmosphere! The people are always so Friendly and helpful! Always can come here and know i will get good food! The best location for us"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since it's within walking distance and our kids could ride their bikes to the restaurant. We walked in about 7:15 on a Wednesday night. Majority of the low tables were pushed together for a large party. No one acknowledged us or came over. We finally decided to leave at 7:32 because our kids were thirsty and our drink order had still not been taken. There were two severs working that we could see. A blonde waitress and a dark brunette bartender. The menu had interesting food items to choose from but not worth the horrible service."}
{"text":"This is the worst bartender service in the park.    Rude, confrontational, and demand a card if you want to step outside, on their patio.   I left due to their lack of tack when saying they demanded my card. It was loud and humiliating - unnecessary to do that in front of others in the restaurant/bar.  IN ADDITION, Be prepared, they charge what they want and add gratuity. It happened on my card!!!!!!!!!! Better check with your bank about the charge.  MY DEBIT CARD WAS CHARGED WITHOUT ME SIGNING IT! Good Luck!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We made reservations for a large party and the food took over 3 hours to come out. We left prior to receiving all of the food orders."}
{"text":"Great burger special with onion rings. Chef cut it in half to share and gave us each a pickle! Thank you!! Watching the Cardinals and the D'Backs!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Surprisingly good food! Great service. They even put the Oilers game on for us! Clean. Fun atmosphere. Good patio. Noisy but in a good way."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has an average four star.  The beer was really cold but the food was pretty awful. Especially the Irish nachos"}
{"text":"The service sucked. All the servers were huddled around some guy who I guess was the manager.  We waited 15 minutes and still no service. We left and went next door tom the open air area at the Mexican food place.  It had great service and we ended up staying until closing.  Stay clear of the Lazy Palms and give the Mexican food spot a try in the outside bar. another thing..it looked like the  customers (3) that were there were to young to drink alcohol."}
{"text":"We looked this up in Yelp while visiting the Wigwam Arts Festival the weekend of February 17-19th. We went for lunch at 1:00 PM. It was moderately crowded and promptly seated outside on a sunny day. We received our drinks right away from the waitress. She took our order for food right afterwards. Simple oder. We waited 45 minutes. We asked the waitress to check on our food order; never did. There were 5 other tables with drinks only and NO food . We finally got up and left. The waitress even insisted on us paying for the only 1 iced tea. And charged 5 dollars for 1 iced tea. No apology or sorry about the POOR service and WAIT. We will tell ALL our friends and NEVER come again. Hard to imagine the 4 1/2 Stars received at YELP."}
{"text":"This has easily become my favorite place to eat. Have the Big Geno and some jalapeno poppers. Also, if you get a chance to do the \"beer and a brush\" here, it is awesome. First time I ever painted and it turned out great. I didn't want to go at first and now I want to paint more and more."}
{"text":"Once you get past the eyesore that is an overabundance of suburban sprawl, Litchfield Park is a rather beautiful corner of town. The older pockets, near mainstays like the Wigwam, are aesthetically pleasing and worth a visit. So on a gloomy morning with perfect weather, I popped in to catch an early Cardinals game, grab a bite, and do some day drinking.  The space was small, but efficient in seating. I sat where I wanted, and within a couple minutes someone was there to serve me. The menu is typical bar food, but they really specialize in burgers, of which there are a TON of choices. I would have really preferred if so many of the choices didn't involve their brand of nacho cheese. Questionable. I liked my sliders, and I liked even more the coldest beer I've had it quite some time. It's borderline freezing, but it REALLY hits the spot while taking the edge off watching Palmer throw the dumbest interceptions ever.   And so while it's a decent bar, and there's an abundance of TVs, what's up with the sound? It's oh so quiet. Also, I'm clearly watching the game, so why are you asking me if I want my check during the beginning of my fourth quarter? Our server was sweet, but I felt rushed out as soon as I was done eating. You should be eager to keep the ice-cold lagers coming because this is freaking *GAMEDAY* and I am *THIRSTY*   Would I come back here? Yes! It's hella chill. I liked my food and drink, so why not give the Lazy Palm experience another try?"}
{"text":"Awesome service, good selection of beer on tap, and ah-mazing Irish Nachos. The cheese is an in house recipe that is out of this world. We were here with friends on a whim planning to stay for dinner, and ended up staying 4 hours. We had been here when it was previously Taps and were never impressed - we are definitely happy with the change."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat, watch a game, or just have a some drinks wi friends. Just make sure your hungry if you order a burger because they are HUGE! The owner is very friendly along with his staff. I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for a long time always drove by and said I gotta try it out. Finally did and glad I did. Great place to have out have some drinks and food. I've had chicken wings and burgers both great. Service is great. When you first walk in you can tell that there are some regulars at the bar that kinda look at you like WTF you doing in my place but it's mostly grumpy old man."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this great grill. Great service, clean, burgers are huge! We shared a burger and ordered an onion ring stack. Yum!"}
{"text":"Have to admit I was very disappointed. The service was average at best but it is not the fault of the two young ladies working. It falls squarely on the owner as he/she understaffed the restaurant. The gals working tried their best.  The food was great and plenty for the price and we will try it again. Always give places a couple of chances."}
{"text":"Burgers looked good, service was good.  Run of the mill beer selection.  Had gyro sliders for an app (always a good addition to the slider arsenal!) ... Way overpriced.  $9.99 should get you sliders and fries .. Not just three lonely mini burgers. New place .. Figuring it out .. Across from Wigwam so they have a shot I guess."}
{"text":"Horrible patio, service AND food.  Was recommended by someone to come here while in town for Spring Training.  Perplexed as to why."}
{"text":"Please ask what size beer, and which ones are on Happy hour. Eight of us there last night, they brought us all 26 once mugs. Woo we are seniors. ..peed  all night. Some were on Happy hour and some were not. Oh well the food was good."}
