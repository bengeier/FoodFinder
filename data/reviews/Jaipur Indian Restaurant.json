{"text":"Great food! Owner personally walked my friend and I through the buffet. Everything smelled and looked great!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food I ever had in Charlotte. I and my husband has tried almost every Indian restaurant but Jaipur Restaurant has the best food quality and even the quantity. Feels like home back in India. 

The owner is also very nice and kind. I will recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Love the place, excellent buffet, fresh variety of menu items. The owner cares about the guests and tries to make sure everything is taking care of properly. The naan, chicken and vegetables are delicious!!!

I definitely recommend.

{"text":"After looking around for few days in town finally ended up here. Best service good food. This will be my meal for the rest of the stay in North carolina. Best of all I tried around this area."}
{"text":"I reached the place at 1.45  pm on Sunday and I was received in a good way. he greeted me and offered a place to sit.  he came to me and offered water and took the order. He got me fresh tandoori and dosas(Indian Pancakes) and ambiance was excellent. They served goat meet, chciken tandoori and chicken tikka masala. They even server panipuri and chat for just 10.95. it,s worth my money. Their menu is quite extensive and servers are always open to assist if you have no idea what you want.  I highly recommend the weekend dinner buffet to try out entrees. I recommend this restaurant as this is run by one family. they think customer once come, should always come back. Fish item and goat curry  was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is mediocre at best. Came here for lunch w/ the co-workers, really sad looking buffet, the inside looks gloomy and there is a ghetto 2 step down to the sitting area with a \"Watch your step\" sign. There were 2 types of chicken curry - neither was really good. The bbq tandoori chicken and the rice pudding were the highlights. 

Not much variety and nothing great to rave about here. On the positive - it is cheap"}
{"text":"The food is really good there as well as the pricing! The Paneer Tikka Masala is my favorite dish. I haven't had the buffet; however, I do think this is a wonderful way to try various dishes for future dining. The decor needs an update. If that is addressed, I could see more people going there for a date night dinner . It's perfect for a business lunch. In the end, good food, good service and good prices makes this a great place."}
{"text":"I am a recent fan of Indian food and have only had three places that serve it and no expert on the matter. As such, I would say this is very good and the staff is very helpful. 

This was my first Indian food experience and I have came back on many occasions. I always come for the lunch buffet (M-F 11-2:30, S-S 12-3) and they always have a big selection. They boast that they have 45 items which I am sure includes the condiments because there are usually only 10 main dishes (50% vegetarian). The Naan is some of the best I have had.

They have a big menu for lunch or dinner (Tandoor, Chicken, Lamb, Seafood and Vegetarian).  If you have never had Indian food I would highly recommend this place for your first meal."}
{"text":"Tasty food with very reasonable prices. Buffet is excellent. The boss is very friendly and it was good to chat with him. Parking space availability is also appreciated. Loved the pudding dessert at the buffet!"}
{"text":"When we moved to Charlotte, we were worried we wouldn't find good Indian food. Luckily, we found Jaipur. This is some of the best Indian food we've had. The vegetarian dishes are outstanding, especially all of the Okra dishes. The meat dishes, both with sauce as well as the Tandoori dishes, are also great. When they ask if you want it mild, medium, or hot, mild is plenty hot for me. Seriously, if you ask for a \"hot\" level of spice, it's no joke.The buffet is really good too. The people that work here are so nice. Jaipur is the best."}
{"text":"Years ago, I came here often and enjoyed it. Now, not so much. Everything is VERY tired and the food is lacking in too many ways."}
{"text":"Save yourself. The food is terrible and the service matches the food. The service has been better at times when the elderly man was absent, I had to be really lucky for that to happen."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to the Jaipur for years. The food was always good and the service, while not fawning over you was at least civil. We just went again this evening. My wife's treat for my birthday. I always get the Lamb Korma and they do a very good job of keeping it mild, as that's the way I like it. The service was a bit disjointed this evening. We got there about 1/2 hour after they opened in the evening. They weren't really set up. We sat for about ten minutes before any water came. The two brothers that own and run the place were almost totally disconnected from the customers. One brother was complaining about the painful wrist joints he had, to another customer. This customer came in after we did and received priority service. My menu ordered food came and I had to wait for the plate to put it on. Usually the plate arrives 10 minutes before the food. I found that some of the subtler ingredients were missing from the Korma. There were no cashews or raisens in the sauce as is usual
 for this Lamb Korma. Can't complain about the lamb though, it was loaded and quite good, considering some of the best ingredients were missing. My wife ate from the buffet and she was a bit disappointed as well. There was no itly; small, white, round things that is almost a staple in Indian restaurants. The daal was very watery, almost like a broth. The Kheer, which is like a rice pudding, was also missing a few of the subtle ingredients such as the cashew bits and the saffron and cardomom. My wife is Indian, so she knows what should be there and it is evident that they are cutting corners these days. The service is lacking, the original Indian dishes are lacking. This is too bad, because this was one of our 'go to' Indian restaurants. There used to be plenty of Indians whenever we went in, and these were lacking as well. Though there were plenty of Americans eating there which leads me to surmise that the are gearing their foods and ingredients toward the American palate. Americans may think they know Indian food but unless they have been exposed to a lot of authentic Indian food, they don't really know what they are getting. My wife cooks Indian food, she grew up in India. I have been to India twice and stayed with Indians and I ate the food they cooked and if we went out to eat, which wasn't very often, it was real, authentic, fire in the belly, Indian food. Sad to see the two brothers aren't as friendly and amiable as they used to be and they don't seem to have anyone working for them on the floor. Maybe they aren't making as much as they used to, but if this continues, I don't see them staying in business much longer. The ambiance is lacking a little but it is passable. The wife and I will have to double think our next visit. Again, it's too bad, to see a restaurant that stood out from the others, going downhill. Also my wife said the condiment bar, near the pani puri, was smelling of rotted food, not a nice accompanyment to a meal. Again, maybe not enough help in the place to clean like they should. I couldn't recommend this place any more, like I used to. After this visit, I had to share with yelp. I really liked this place but time has done it's job."}
{"text":"This Indian Restaurant used to be the go-to restaurant for my wife and I. After 8 months we returned and I have to say, we will be looking for a new favorite Indian Restaurant. The two brothers that run this place don't seem to be able to retain wait staff. They used to be a lot friendlier and pleasant. Seems that the years are starting to take their toll. The food is still fairly good. My main entree was spot on and was delicious. The side items are a different matter. I ordered Naan with my meal. It seemed to be just rushed through with only a little dab of butter in the center on top. Most naan is brushed liberally with butter. This seems like they just don't care. When we came in, my wife was told that \"we like people to come in, eat, and then get out, no hanging around.\" REALLY??? This makes people want to come back? The surly attitude and rushed service because they can't keep help, so only one person on the floor to tend the customers, this makes people want  to come back? Questioning why you want a receipt when they noticed that you ate liberally at the buffet? Isn't that the idea of a buffet? And while we are on about the buffet, the choices offered seem to have diminished quite a bit. No idlee??? A staple of Indian meals and they don't have it??? This makes people want to come back? I think Jaipur has had it's better days and is now on the downward slope to obscurity. For a Saturday night, the place used to be packed, now they were struggling to keep four tables full. They only had one dessert choice where they used to have about three or four. The crockery isn't very clean, I had to search to find a clean bowl. Does the Health Dept. visit here any more? No, I think we'll start searching elsewhere as this place has hit the wall for service, choice, friendliness and shortness of staff. Two in the kitchen and one on the floor, that's it! There are a lot of Indian Restaurants in town these days, we'll just have to make the rounds. Aljo Jaipur."}
{"text":"My daughter and I are in town for one night and are staying at a hotel just 7 minutes away. We almost didn't go here because of some bad reviews that were left. We did the dinner buffet, and it was amazing.  We highly recommend the vegetable pakoras, naan,  tamarind sauce, lentil dahl, and most of all, the rice pudding. The people couldn't be any nicer, and it was an adorable place. It was absolutely wonderful and would definitely go again If we are ever in town again. 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place manages to get 3.5 stats. They serve the worst carryout Indian food in whole Charlotte area. The buffet looks unhygienic and if you dont mind a stomach ache please visit this place."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with amazing food! You can go to the more flashy, expensive places for Indian cuisine, but for authenticity go to Jaipur! Not much on atmosphere, but wonderful food. Their buffet on Friday and Saturday is awesome! Half vegetarian and half non-vegetarian. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"I drove around Charlotte for two hours exploring and when I decided to eat I found myself searching through Yelp for the best local restaurant in town.  Almost everything I searched was pointing me to Uptown, going against my instinct I found this little restaurant at the bottom of the review page.  I decided to give it a go.  

I am all about Indian food and was willing to try any place, including this one that is located in a shady looking shopping center.  I was surprised, as soon as I walked in I was greeted by every employee and seated.  I went with chicken buryani, chicken tikka, saag paneer, and chicken curry, with a large helping of bread.

I was impressed, I was glad I had chosen a buffet and knew I would be helping myself to seconds.  The service was great, even though they were busy, I never had an empty glass in front of me.  The price was exrtremely reasonable and the quality of food was top notch; its a shame I don't live in Charlotte, otherwise I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"We did takeout from here and it was a strange experience. I ordered my food and then the lady who was taking my order got into an argument with the older gentlemen behind the counter and completely ignored me. Nothing was told to me about waiting in a certain area, the food took about 40min. The place was dark inside I'm not sure how the people dining in could see their food. The portion and food was decent, but not for the premium I was charged. The chicken was actually good, the naan was a little overdone, that dish would be the only one I go back for only if severely pressed for an Indian option on S. Blvd."}
{"text":"If I can put a negative star, I would.  Everyone, STAY AWAY from this place.  Someone, who I believe is the owner, is the rudest and hostile person in the world.  Again, STAY AWAY from this horrible place!"}
{"text":"An authentic Indian tandoori oven put to use by a talented chef!  The best priced lunch and dinner buffet, coupled with a full menu makes this a must eat destination.  The owner works FOH each day so you can be sure to receive 5 star service on any budget.  Fresh naan offered from the buffet and brought hot from the oven allows one to leave the fork on the table!"}
{"text":"Food is really good. I loved dal tadka a lot! They served us well on thanksgiving day also when all others were closed. Biryani was not good so you can avoid that, but food items from northern part of India were awesome. The manager and server were very friendly."}
{"text":"Jaipur is an excellent Indian restaurant.  They have wonderful tandoori chicken - some of the best I've had (and I've had Indian from Europe to across the US).  The kheer is delicious, with just the right amount of cardamom flavoring.  The food is well-spiced.  The service is friendly and efficient, always on top of taking plates away / refilling water.  Super place!"}
{"text":"Awesome and simple food ..good service ..we went on labour day and we enjoyed lunch a lpt ..dal makhani, mix veg, roti, yogurt rice, pickle"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Indian food, there is no better place than Jaipur. The owner is adorable - others might think that he's stand offish, but he's really shy. Once you get to know him better, he really looks out for you and treats you like one of his family members. 
Besides the great management, I love the food. I would recommend the chicken curry. And if you are a fan of spicy food (I mean so spicy you can't feel your tongue or stomach) I would go for spice level \"spicy +\"."}
{"text":"Good food and wonderful service, unlimited Dosas were awesome. Chicken tandoori was delicious.. Limited items in buffet but what ever items on buffet menu was delicious . Will give a try again ."}
{"text":"We ate here with one of my gusband's coworkers who was born and raised in Southern India.  When he comes to Charlotte, he always visits Jaipur.  We let him do all of the ordering for the table which really helped aince we've only had Indian food a few times.  All of the naans were greatvas well as the various chutney and dipping sauces.  He ordered medium heat on the main diahes but we could easily have had spicy.  Really nice staff, the owner came to the table several times.  Clean restrooms as well."}
{"text":"I liked Jaipur.  The lunch buffet had plenty to choose from for my taste and $9.  I especially enjoyed the fried vegetable samosas with tamarind chutney.  Those were some fine samosas - crunchy on the outside and rich in the middle.

I didn't try the meat dishes - I was on a fiber blitz.  The vegetarian dishes that I did try included a kidney bean dish that was a new try for me and tasty, a ground eggplant dish that I also liked, and a slightly bland cauliflower and potato (gobi aloo) dish.  I added some of the near-perfect onion chutney to the latter.

I liked the relatively low salt content of this food.  It was refreshing.  I also endorse the condiment bar.  They even had a dish of raw chilies.

Not perfect, but worth the money.  The man working the front of the house (a part-owner?) was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Food is good and authentic.  Atmosphere leaves a little to be desired but overall good experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I along with my son just left this restaurant a few minutes ago. This was a  place we used to come to when we used to date and had wonderful food. Well after tonight I will never go back to this place again. They only had a Valentine's dinner buffet tonight and you couldn't order from the menu which was fine. The appetizers were cold and the meats (chicken and Kabobs) tasted old and dry like they were made in this morning. The desserts also tasted dated as well. Main entrees was not as delightful as they should be. The best part of the dinner was when we were ready to check out. The bill for 2 adults and 1 child was a grand total of $62.00??? $62.00??? ARE YOU SHITTING ME?? $62.00 ??? Never again will I step back in this place. Much better Indian Resturant's elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was the most horrible tasteless and dry piece of chicken I've ever had in my life. Their rice was the only thing they actually managed somehow well with."}
{"text":"Good Indian food with several vegetarian options. Friendly staff. Furniture and fixtures are tired and old. The lunch and weekend buffets have a nice selection. Not cheap."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to hotel. Not a great service. Was delayed by an hour, though they were within a stone's throw from my place where I was staying. Food was ok. Ordered goat biryani, tandoori chicken, kadhai paneer. Those were ok, not the greatest."}
{"text":"Got delivery tonight. Butter chicken sauce was blood red like marinara and chicken was shedded in the sauce which I have never seen before. The Tamarind sauce that came with samosas was redish orange when its typically dark brown and Galub Jamin desert was way different than any Indian restaurant ever. If i could give zero stars i would. Absolutely horrible"}
{"text":"I honestly dont know how these guys are still in business. Their food is not fresh, not tasty and just full of colored chemicals."}
{"text":"If you want bad Indian food sprinkled with spotty service & a side of awful decor, then this is the place for you. I still don't understand why people return here for food. Inconsistent quality of food & service. I wouldn't eat here even if it was free."}
{"text":"So to start the owner of the restaurant is an amazingly sweet man. While I waited for my food we chatted then he offered me \"samples\" from the buffet (it was literally like another meal) I ordered the Medley BIRIYANI. It's one of the rice specials with lamb chicken and shrimp, to die for. Had the right amount of spice and it was seasoned perfectly. Oh and the buffet food was amazing as well. Will be going back for sure"}
{"text":"The first time we ate here, about a month ago, we found the food decent and they accommodated a toddler pretty well (no small thing.) As a transplant from San Francisco, I was surprised at the prices -- comparable to higher-end SF Indian restaurants and nowhere near the tastiness.

Had two dishes: Chicken Makhani and a saag dish. Nothing knocked me out, but all was fine.

The second time we went there, last week on my birthday, we ended up walking out before they took our order. The waitress was in the weeds with only 2 tables and seemed to be preoccupied with computer problems. 

After sitting unacknowledged at our table for 15 minutes we finally left. If she'd made some sort of motion to let us know she'd be over we might have been more understanding, but we were hungry and not in the mood to be ignored."}
{"text":"Went to Jaipur for the first time today, just in time for their lunch buffet.  In general, I'm not a big fan of buffets, but Indian is my one exception.  I have to say, this place has the best Indian food that I've tried in Charlotte so far.  The manager/owner(?) was extremely accommodating, and the buffet had a really nice selection to choose from.  We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"While the owner was so incredibly nice and helpful (constantly bringing fresh naan and dosas to the tables), this was unfortunately the worst Indian food I've ever eaten. Everything was bland and oily, and we had queasy stomachs for hours after. 

Dosa was, by far, the best item on the buffet. Chicken Tikka Masala was neither sweet nor spicy enough. Bhaigan Bhurtha was the strangest consistency - baby food purée - with no noticeable smokiness or flavor that I'd typically expect. Mutter Paneer was flavorless. The Pani Puri / chaat bar was nice to have, although each ingredient was not well executed. The green and coconut chutneys were good. 

It was interesting to find a dinner buffet, and the price is great. If you've never eaten Indian food and you worry about it being too spicy, this place might be worth a try."}
{"text":"Never going back. Horrible food with very poor taste for most of the items. Not really authentic. If you are really looking for real Indian taste with spice and good quality, please try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Grubhub while traveling and was pleasantly surprised by the food (although it took almost 2 hours to get to me). 

Ordered chicken vindaloo (comes with basmati rice) and naan. 

Chicken vindaloo could definitely have been spicier, but had good flavor. Rice was perfectly cooked and naan was great. 

Portion was quite large for the price paid. All in all, I was happy with this restaurant and would order again."}
{"text":"Worst experience.. Manager aka waiter aka all in one was very rude...Food quality was bad...No taste....Don't give a try... Actual prices are higher than online...."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through doorstep.  Horrible!!!

Paneer Pakora burn and dried out!
Garlic Cheese Nan tasted stale and as if was out in microwave.  
Chicken Tikka Masala way too spicy.  Tasted like spicy tomato soup!
Lamb Samosa burnt 

No flatware either so had to leave room to try to find some so I could even eat the dinner.  Just plan horrible food!  What a waste!  Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, well priced Average Indian food. Small place with good variety of Indian food. Ordered masala tea and naan, vegetable kadahi and it tasted good."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid spot for lunch. I ordered take out with my coworker and we split an order of naan, butter chicken and saag paneer. 

The naan is delicious. It's very authentic and fresh. If you're dining with someone...one order is definitely enough to share. 

Both entrees were delicious. We ordered one medium spicy and one extra spicy and you could really tell the difference! I appreciated that. I'm a fan of super spicy food and they really deliver here. 

My only gripe is that I would have liked to have more paneer with the saag. But it was great flavors. 

The staff were all very nice and you get a 15% discount on your orders."}
{"text":"Yum!! Love the buffet as well as a mango lassi. About $10 for the buffet (if I remember correctly) , good service, good food. It's not my favorite indian place in charlotte, but it's high on my list."}
{"text":"I went into Jaipur today to get two takeout lunches for myself and my son. When I walked in I was greeted by an older gentleman whom I presumed to be the owner. I told him I would like takeout from the buffet. His demeanor immediately changed and he hemmed and hawed until finally saying \"yes ok\".
He disappeared and then came back with a takeout box when he proceeded to tell me he would have to prepare the box for me and it will be $9. I said that is fine and I will need two to go. He looked even more perturbed and begrudgingly got another box. I said I don't want everything on the buffet so he gave me the box and dared to let me pick out my own food. However, he followed me and watched closely, insisting that I \"need more rice\". I layered the bottom of the container with rice and then literally put one scoop each of the four vegetarian dishes and two meat dishes from the buffet. I did not even get any of the tandoori chicken.
I closed the box and when I asked him for the second takeout box he said to me \"no, you can only take one\". I then said \"but I need two\" and he again said no. I handed him the box I had previously prepared and said \"keep it then\". I can almost guarantee that he probably emptied that container back into the buffet.
I have never been to this restaurant before and have no idea if the food is good or not, but if you have to treat your customers this way then perhaps you're in the wrong business and should go to work for the government instead. I will not be going back and am happy to spread the word."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst place I've ever eaten at.  The food was overpriced and bland at best. The whole place feels like you're eating in a funhouse. There was almost nothing in the buffet, which we were repeatedly told by the owner was good.  Eating at this restaurant is a mistake that I will never live down and haunt my dreams until the day I die."}
{"text":"Good restaurant !! close to downtown i.e. about 7 miles from the charlotte downtown, good ambience, neat and clean atmosphere, good service and good food. Overall a good restuarant to try indian food in charlotte."}
{"text":"typical indian buffet. food didn't taste fresh. The service was attentive though."}
{"text":"The food's great! This was our first time and we will be sure to come back. The service was excellent and so was the buffet."}
{"text":"It's 5:35 pm on Saturday. No one is here and the doors are locked. Not cool! We're from out of town and wanted to eat here but, oh well...."}
{"text":"I ordered Chicken Bhuna and Mango Lassi for takeout.  The food was excellent.  The Chicken Bhuna was just a touch greasy (not too much though) but absolutely delicious and cooked very well with the right spices.  The gravy on the chicken bhuna was thick and delectable.  The mango lassi was good.  I'd have given this a 3.5 stars but it's better than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good food, great for a small buffet but nothing spectacular. Service was great when it came to refilling drinks only the drinks came out wrong; I ordered unsweetened tea but I only got sweet tea the entire visit, not a big deal, only annoying. More naan should be made available at the buffet. We only received one small plateful, first world problems right?"}
{"text":"Never do delivery from this place. Seriously. First of all the ordering process is absurd; I even called back after ten minutes after placing my initial order as the person taking my order did not even ask for my hotel room number or contact number. I feel as though they need to increase the wait staff as they always seem overwhelmed. The food is okay, but this is my second time ordering and ecah time I ask for spice level very spicy and I get just over moderate. After having waited over one hour for my current order I called back to inquire as to the status and the receptionist said \"we have been busy that's why it's late\" so poor service is a total deal breaker for me. Not my problem you're understaffed."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago where the biggest Indian town is, this place is legit for less than $10 i think it's $9 for weekday lunch buffet, this is worth it. I guess i'm not really picky as i am after the the taste and the spicy chicken is just right to the taste. Im surprised it's empty this Monday but definitely coming back with friends for a cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Best vindaloo I've had so far!!! It was so spiced up and tons of flavor!!! Definitely am coming back!!"}
{"text":"Was traveling for work and decided to try this place after I read the reviews. 

I showed up at the end of the night and the owner was kind enough to still serve me and he was extremely nice. 

Ordered the Chicken Biyani, Naan and the Indian chai tea. Hands down, the best chicken biryani was the best I have ever had. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the rice was amazing.  Sometimes the rice in this dish can taste dry but not at this place. He also gave me a sauce I had never tried to accompany the biryani. SO good! 

The naan was also amazing, some of the best naan I have had.

Stopping here made my whole work trip worth it! I had so much leftover too! Huge portions and amazing food.

I can't recommend this place enough, such a great find."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is consistently amazing and you can tell that the owner has a pride in what he offers- he's very friendly and takes good care of the customers. The chicken raizala is amazing- I order it every time! Try the keema naan and saag paneer- yum!! I have also had the buffet, but prefer ordering from the menu. Everything is always so fresh!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state, we thought we would try something different. This is the first time I ever had Indian Food. The lunch buffet was reasonably priced, but I wish there was more of a selection. Unfortunately, there was only three things I enjoyed. (Again, it may be because I never had Indian food) the food turned over quickly, it was hot and the staff was attentive."}
{"text":"Being Indian, I know what 'real' Indian food should taste like.  That being said, I gave Jaipur 3 stars because I can tell they put ready-made flavor powders, instead of a roasted and ground combination of spices that we do at home.  In any case, I am a repeat patron here and will continue to be as long as I crave Indian food outside my home.

I always go for the buffet, just cause I like to have a little bit of everything they have.  We have come to know the owners very well over the past 4 years that Ive lived here.  I also know when the regular chef is off, because I can immediately tell the watered down or off tasting curries.  

Good food, good service, very weird seating arrangement and also location is a bit questionable.  Sandwiched between a bi-lo and a sally's beauty supply."}
{"text":"When I did not see this restaurant highlighted in regards to Indian food in Charlotte, I had to write a review!  This place has been around over 10 years on South Boulevard in the shopping center with Food Lion (closest to), Big Lots, Anna's Linens, CitiTrends, etc., close to intersection with Archdale Road.  The only weekend dinner buffet I know and with meat (lamb, goat, chicken) options.  Always enjoy their entrees on and off the buffet.  Their menu is quite extensive and servers are always open to assist if you have no idea what you want.  I highly recommend the weekend dinner buffet to try out entrees."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet during the week"}
{"text":"The food was just delicious!  We found this location based on Yelp and we were totally happy with our dinner here.  I highly recommend eating here when you get the chance."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner here and had a great time. All 4 of my party had the buffet and definitely couldn't complain. Two of us never had Indian before and really enjoyed the selection of food and the service. They offered 3 selections of chicken, 1 goat selection, and several veggie options which were all delicious. The staff was very attentive bringing us extra bread hot bread even though they keep it on the buffet. Our drinks were never empty and they were very polite. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great place,  Clean, very helpful... We got to weekend buffet around 2 and good food...
Not a big buffet but very tasty"}
{"text":"Good Indian food.  I would love to try the \"super buffet\" which boasts 45 items, and is available Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night.  If you are ordering off the menu, be sure to print the discount coupon off the website!"}
{"text":"You literally lose your appetite even before you can start. The silverware was stained. The tables were spotted. The table clothes were sticky.
We went for the lunch buffet. They were open from 12:00 pm and we went in around 12:20. The restaurant was empty, however most of the buffet trays were nearly empty. I can just hope it was not the previous days leftovers.
Coming to the food- majority of the dishes tasted bland and stale. The ones which seemed fresh, tasted average at best.
Service however was rather nice. The servers were kind and took good care of us.
Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The food tasted great, but spice levels were disappointing. Would have preferred more heat!"}
{"text":"It is one of the most best resturant in charlotte. Excellent food. Superior service. If any one is missing Indian food, this is the best place to have it. Also don't forget to have mango lassi."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch buffet. This is a Charlotte must, tucked in the deeps of south blvd it's a gem. Everything's been a 10. Every time."}
{"text":"This is definitely a diamond in the rough!

Located in a ghetto strip mall, but don't let it fool you. The hubbster and I have eaten here on many occasions and I finally have to tell the world (or at least the world o' Yelp). This place is amazing. I not only say this for the food. I say this for the customer service and atmosphere. It's a family owned establishment and you are treated just like one. 

I have tried their weekly buffet lunch and their weekend buffet dinner. I would love to go for a non buffet, but the food, selection, and price for the buffet is so good I just can't pull myself away from it:) The lunch buffet isn't as good as the dinner though, but I think that is because it isn't as busy. At least the times I have gone that's the way it's been. 

For the weekend dinner they offer appetizers, soup, 2 different kinds of rice, naan, and multiple dishes, plus desserts. For 2 dinner buffets, large Kingfisher for about $30! Who can beat that??? To say I need a wheel barrel to leave the establishment is an understatement. 

We even had our Xmas din din here. It was absolutely packed and it put the biggest smile on my face to know that this wonderful place gets the support and the recognition it deserves. I am proud to write this and to verbally tell people if they are looking for wonderful Indian cuisine this is the place to get it.

Yummers!"}
{"text":"40 minute wait for a take out order on a Saturday night with only one table seated? Not sure how they are profitable and seems that this place has seen better days. 

Instead of braving the crowds at the newly opened Tandur Indian Kitchen in SouthPark we called in an order of tikka masala, saag paneer, lamb samosa, chicken pakora, and some naan. We called ahead, they said it would be 20 minutes, and I arrived with five minutes to spare, thinking I could pay and be ready to go back home ASAP. It appears there was only one person in the kitchen and one person out front. 

Not the worst Indian food I've had, but I was disappointed in the low volume of cheese in our saag paneer. I imagine the experience for a lunch buffet is more positive, but takeout dinner simply didn't make me want to return. The reviews are decidedly split. There are plenty of other options for food in this part of South Blvd - check out Burrito Factory, Crispy Banh Mi, or Jasmine Grill."}
{"text":"Nothing too exciting, Buffet with all the usual selections, the chutneys were excellent though"}
{"text":"This was a delivery order. Travel a lot and have tried a few Indian restaurants in the area. By far highest quality food in my opinion relative to nearby Indian options. I'm definitely a snob too. Kinda surprised to see rating isn't higher, but I'm not rating the service element -- just the food.

Ordered chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. Chicken had a nice char on it. Naan was unique, had garlic and herbs kneaded into flour. I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The decor is a little catty wompus but the food is delicious and reasonably priced.  It's certainly the best Indian food restaurant I've eaten at to date in North Carolina.  Tandoori chicken is my favorite Indian dish and they serve a really good one here.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Being Northern Indian, there is nothing that I miss more than good Mughlai food. With classic dishes like Butter Chicken, Daal Makhni, Rogan Josh and Naan, this cuisine has taken the world by storm as it should. And Charlotte is no stranger to this cuisine. So when I saw Jaipur, rated higher than the other indian restaurants in the area, my sister and I decided to order take out. Let me preface this by saying the food was not bad! The butter chicken tasted like butter chicken, the samosas were crispy but not overdone and the biryani was also fine. Best tasting in the area? Definitely not but that's not the issue. The issue is how much they cheap you out of your meal and money. I counted THREE small pieces of lamb in my $17 lamb biryani. I essentially paid to eat a large bowl of yellow rice. Very disappointing. The raita (yogurt) was served in a small dip container. Will not be visiting/ordering again."}
{"text":"I ate here for their lunch time buffet.  The restaurant itself was a bit seedy and somewhat rundown; however, the food was excellent, especially considering it was a buffet.  They brought fresh Naan bread to the table and it was very reasonably priced.  I'd certainly recommend the food."}
{"text":"Unfortunately Jaipur has gone downhill since I last frequented the establishment. I got the Navratan Korma and the sauce was broken and sour tasting. Another time, I got the mushroom mutter delivered via Foodie Call and the order was wrong. The Foodie Call employee said the manager of the restaurant refused to believe it and denied a refund. I might give it another try. It's such a shame because I used to go here every week and loved the dinner buffet and the customer service."}
{"text":"The food was ok, I enjoyed it, the atmosphere wast that great though, and its very difficult trying to call in an order."}
{"text":"We have had their Saturday buffet several times, and we think it is terrific in every regard.  It looks like they cater to a mostly Indian clientele, which is a good thing, so they don't hold back on the spices.  There is nothing I hate more than an anemic masala or vindaloo--not even Communism.  Everything is delicately seasoned--the nan bread, the main dishes, the mango lassi and desserts.  I think they have absolutely the best tandoori chicken I've ever eaten.  It was spot on.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here and want to go back soon.  There are mirrors on all the walls, so you get this Palace of Versailles \"Hall of Mirrors\" effect while you're eating.  You can watch yourself eat.  You can watch 12 of yourself eat.  You can watch EVERYONE eat.  Probably not something you want to see if you're dropping acid.  Ghee is lovely, lovely stuff.  They have a large selection of entrées--chicken, seafood, lamb, vegetarian dishes, appetizers, and lots of breads.  We've been here for sit down dinner and for the buffet; I think the buffet is the best bang for the buck.  The buffet desserts are fun, too: galub jamun, rice pudding, and falooda, an ice cream with mango and rose water toppings.  When we ordered dinner off the menu the first time, it was tasty, but they had a party in the back, and we felt sadly neglected by our server; but it's probably not like that every time.  I guess I'm the only one waiting to see a beef tikka masala in an Indian restaurant someday--I haven't given up hope!  I give this establishment 5 Ganesha trunks up."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the naan were fresh from the kitchen.  The owner of the restaurant is very hospitable.  Their dessert rice pudding was excellent, better than any I've tried.  I would visit this place again for sure.  And I'm glad to have found a really good Indian buffet closer to home!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few Indian restaurants where you get quality and fresh food. We're new in town and happened to try this place for dinner on a week day.   We ordered meal/dinner for two which came out to be $40.00 but it was totally worth it as the food was enough to for 5 people. We had to take the leftovers home. Mr. Alam served us. The restaurant was very quiet and hence we could have a good chat with him. He was very warm and told us a lot of good things about the city. They deliver food uptown too..."}
{"text":"Great Indian food. Interior's a bit unattractive. Service is average. Location is alright. 

I would go again for dinner food."}
{"text":"Tucked into a strip mall, this Indian restaurant was surprisingly good. Not a big crowd at 7pm when we got there for dinner. My wife and I enjoyed the lamb samosas. Good flavor, nice and crispy and hot out of the fryer.  My wife loves chicken tikka masala, and this one did not disappoint.  My lamb korma was also rather tasty and the garlic and plain naan were very fresh, hot out of the oven.  The service was good and prices reasonable. We will be back."}
{"text":"My family's been coming here for years, we always get the buffet. It's our favorite Indian place. The decor/environment could use a little updating, but the food is great!"}
{"text":"Jaipur is definitely a hit or miss kind of joint. They do lack consistency in quality, flavor, spice distribution and amount of food given.

Today the order came out completely wrong and had to be redone. The shrimp tikka masala was made of rubbery chewy farmed fish and the medium heat was non existent. There was no spice involved. The tikka masala had no cream consistency to it today. It was very runny and overpoweringly tomato based. 

The first experience I had merited 3 stars, the second time I ate there they qualified for 3.5 stars, and this last time they really went down to 1 star. I'm averaging them out at 2 stars after three tries.

I've exhausted my attempts. The inconsistency is too great and for the price they shouldn't be lacking at all. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"This is our new take-out Indian food place.  The dine-in facilities are lacking in atmosphere, but the food was tasty and packaged well.  Price was reasonable for the quantity and quality of food.  I can place an order from home, hop in the car and it's ready shortly after I arrive.  PERFECT!    EDIT:  I've been back for takeout 4-5 times and they continue to impress.  Consistent, high-quality food."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is awesome.  I don't care for the buffet as the choices are very limited.  Ordering from the menu is a much better choice.  They seem a bit pricey but remember you get what you pay for.  I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 because they are on the slow side as far as service.  The man who serves you is usually the only one there.  He is very pleasant but a tad slow so if you are in a hurry ...  Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Amazing buffet. Service was stellar. It was our first time, so the owner walked us through everything on the buffet. Fantastic mango lassi"}
{"text":"Delivery takes a very long time! The food was okay, but nothing special. I was told it would take 45-50 min. An hour later, I called again and was told the food was on the way and would arrive in 5-10 minutes. Finally, an hour and a half after placing my order, the food arrived. But it was not worth the wait. They should really be upfront about the delivery time instead of misleading customers."}
{"text":"so, first things first:
1. i'm a visitor from the west coast but lived on the east coast pretty mch all my life so I do know what good Indian food should taste like, unlike the crap we get on the west coast
2. we had the buffet sunday night
3. we'd only had nasty airport food since the morning
Now, even though you'd think ..airport food...maybe thats why she's appreciating this a whole lot....to the contrary...that may be a factor, but not the factor..
food was awesome, not too greasy, and very flavor ful, also surprizingly had chaat, my fav panipuri. I'm not sure where the \"45 item\" came in? i didn't see that many...we had:
-panipuri
-some salad, and the most awesome red colored onion chutney 
-naan
-basmati rice
-gobi aloo
-bhindi masala
-butter chicken
-chili paneer
-dosa
-idli
-sambar
all of it was d-e-l-i-s-h..very authentic and very very good...great service, great food, great price...wknd dinner buffet for 2 for 26 including tax?? damn you can't beat that..  then again i'm used to paying 19.95 per person fora dinner buffet u stand in wait for 45 mins, and end up having to eat south indians trying to cook north indian food..and fudging up every dish..
ok enough venting - eat here, its good."}
{"text":"Just ate at their weekend lunch buffet. The atmosphere is rather strange...not a fancy place. They did not have a large buffet but what they had was good with nice flavors. The service was excellent snd the staff was friendly. The buffet was refreshed often. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was really good. The person who greeted us (guessing the owner) seemed very friendly and attentive. That being said I would rate the food reasonably priced but OK when it comes to my standards for Indian food. It was bland to what I am used to at my usual Indian restaurant (Farmington MI). I will note I have worked for an Indian family for the past 9+ years and have had various types of Indian cuisine and LOVE Indian food in general but I prefer the spicier dishes. So if you are looking for Indian food but don't like things too spicy then this would be a great place."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week for the lunch buffet. They always have a good variety of meat and veggie dishes. Some rotate and some classics are always there. It's my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Very bad experience... Food was not good... Wastage of money and time... Very disappointed"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian joints, ever.  We don't live in Charlotte anymore but I still remember Jaipur fondly.  I also love the family style service.

Channa masala is probably the most common curry the world over, but I swear Jaipur has some of the best.  I also love the bhindi, saag paneer, mint chutney and lentils.  Their naan is pretty darn good.  

I have honestly never had a meat dish here, and I have never tried the buffet, so maybe that accounts for the poor reviews?  The owners were always really gracious to us.   I don't know why they have bad reviews on that either!"}
{"text":"Since one of our favorite Indian places was forced to close, my dinner group decided to try this one out. 

The restaurant is in the wedge of a shopping center on South Blvd near Food Lion. It looks like it actually takes up 2 spaces because they are at two different levels. The right side is a step down than the left side.  

The menu is quite broad and it was difficult making a decision but service was so slow here that we had plenty of time to decide. 

I went with the Curry chicken and I was able to sample some of the other dishes at our table including Chilli Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Once the meals arrived, they were all delicious. The herbs and spices were easily identified and the heat levels were just enough to make your mouth and lips tingle for a few minute - just the way I like it.

One of our group ordered two desserts - the Gulab Jamun and Kheer. Her trick was to mix them together and that was delicious as well.

All of the food was wonderful. The service is what is bringing this down to a 3-star rating. We were a group of 4 and they weren't very busy and it took 2 1/2 hours to get out of there.  So don't go there if you are in a hurry...go there and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Jaipur has long been my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte.  I took my girlfriend there for the first time on Friday for dinner and it blew us away.  I guess on Friday nights they do a buffet which we chose not to get, but it had the one manager/server hopping the entire time we were there.  Despite the fact he was taking care of basically the entire restaurant, he paid amazingly close attention to us and was extremely gracious.  To wit, he started us with a complimentary appetizer of pakora, which was absolutely delicious.

I had the lamb rogan josh, Indian hot.  She had paneer tikka masala.  I got some garlic cheese naan, and she got just some regular naan.  Both of our dishes were outstanding.  I can't help but order lamb every time I eat Indian food so I'd never tried their paneer before, but I stole a bite of hers and it was excellent.  My own dish was fantastic as well - a generous portion of lamb cubes in a delicious sauce.  Of course, the jasmine rice was terrific and perfectly seasoned, and the naan was excellent as usual.

After we were finished, he then came by and gave us a complimentary dessert of what were listed as \"sweet balls\" - and boy, were they.  Basically donut holes in some sort of syrupy glaze (I'm guessing corn syrup was involved), they were intensely sweet...a bit too much so for me, but my girlfriend loved them.

The food was terrific as usual and the service, while never disappointing in the past in any way, simply blew me away this time.  I will absolutely continue to visit Jaipur any time I need to scratch that itch."}
{"text":"Look beyond the décor and give Jaipur a try! It may not feature items specifically from Northern India, but we had a very pleasurable experience there tonight.

What we ate:

Lamb Vindaloo (spicy)
Vegetable Masala (mild)
Garlic Nan bread

Simple and to the point.  Our entrées came with a shared pile of Indian rice.  Beer and wine start from $4.00, which is right on point.

I've not been to India, but grew up in Singapore.  Been eating lots of curry and for now, this will be our Charlotte spot.  Thanks Jaipur."}
{"text":"I did not get as far as to actually eating the food just  based off service alone I gave this restaurant one star. Restaurant opens at 5:30 for dinner I had to knock on the door for them to open promptly and there was a line of other guests waiting for the restaurant to open at 5:30. I ordered the vegetable masala the smell is obviously the spices of curry not masala . I told the gentleman excuse me this is curry not masala  trust me I've ordered masala and Curry before from various Indian restaurants in various states and the gentleman tried to argue me that I'm wrong and what I had in my hand was masala not curry so I just walked out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place.  So I am not really a fan of spicy food but I gave this place a try anyways.  I am sure glad that I came here.  I order the chicken tikka masala with very little spice.  It was delicious.  I also got to try the biriyani which tasted great but as ordered it was a little to spicy for me but my hubby loved it.  The lamb, chicken and shrimp tasted great in the biriyani. 

So don't drive past this little gem.  The food here is amazing.  Next time I might try the buffet if I am up for a little spice in my life!"}
{"text":"Very bad food. Located in a seedy part of town. Was actually afraid walking in.
Nothing was good. Even with the low standards of Indian restaurants in Charlotte, this one should be avoided"}
{"text":"We are indian food lovers and were happy to find this place near our hotel. It is in a strip mall. We had the dinner buffet. Very mediocre and the food was dry and unappealing. Had we not been so tired we would have left. The gnats flying around our table were an irritation. Awful gulag. And it cost 15 pp. Don't bother."}
{"text":"I only got one item and it is entirely possible that I ordered the worst thing on the menu.  Keep that in mind when you read my review.

I didn't get the buffet and that is on me - it seems the buffet may have been a better experience.  I ordered off the menu and was disappointed - that is on Jaipur Indian Restaurant.

I changed my mind, not getting the buffet isn't on me.  A restaurant shouldn't offer 2 star options.  I refuse to accept that I am fool who didn't get the buffet, I can order whatever I want and if it is on the menu then Jaipur Indian Restaurant is responsible for making it the best possible meal.

I got the korma and I was disappointed.  I finished it, but that was because the portion was so small.  Small portions here worked because I didn't want to even bother with the leftovers, why not?  The meal was boring and bland.  I enjoy all food, but I didn't enjoy this more than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  I usually get a bit euphoric from a good meal and Indian food tends to get me there.

The visuals weren't appealing, lack of garnish and the serving dishes were bland, none of this was helped by the feel of the plates and silverware.

The neighborhood of this place is one where I wouldn't be found after sunset and before sunrise.

I was eating with a friend of mine and we had a coupon - so we got a reasonably cheap deal.  Had I been eating alone I would have gotten up and left.  I would first make sure to tell the proprietor I didn't want to pay for or even take another bite of the meal.  I would then ask if I had to pay and if I did then I would pay.  I had great company and a disappointing meal.  It wasn't that the meal itself was so bad, it was that there are so many other Indian restaurants that I know of that are so good.  Every bite was a reminder that I wasn't at the right place for me.  I felt foolish for trying something new."}
{"text":"I have had the lunch buffet here before and decided it was fine but nothing to write home about. However we went there for dinner tonight and had an experience worthy of getting the figurative pen and paper out. 

We entered shortly after they opened and we were promptly greeted by a very friendly middle aged man. Not sure if he is the owner because I have seen him here every time I visit. After reviewing the menu we decided to splurge and get the Maharajah feast for two. 

We started with mixed vegetarian appetizers and it was fun to sample a little bit of everything. I knew I was in trouble during this course - we had just started dinner and I was already getting full. Everything on the vegetable appetizer plate was fried which was good but heavy. The meat appetizer plate came out next and the lamb was my favorite. I am super picky about lamb and it is a testament to how delicious it was. 

Next our mains came out - the chicken tikka masala, chicken bhuna and the mixed vegetable curry. The chicken tikka masala was full of wonderful spice with creamy aspect to cut the heat. The man who greeted us served the entire meal and made sure to offer us additional nan and rice. Like we needed any more food at this point!

We ended with a delicious kheer which I could only take a couple bites of since I was so stuffed. There was plenty leftover to take for lunch tomorrow. The service was attentive and the food absolutely delicious. I would recommend this for anyone craving Indian."}
{"text":"very typical Indian food. (Ghar ka khana) Did not meet my expectations. I had to wait over an hour for food to arrive...management needs work"}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food. Just moved from NY but this place rivals my old neighborhood joint.

Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"You have GOT to be kidding me.  This place has been in a shopping strip for years.  It has no windows so I refused to try them until today in hopes of finding an Indian gem near my work...  WOW...  no.

Dark, hot, dirty and old...  and none of which in a \"good\" way - LOL  There are mirrors on all the walls that make it feel \"trippy\" inside... and again- not in a good way.

The sanitation grade was a 90, and the floor actually moves and creaks loudly as you walk on it.  There's what appears to be a storage area directly beside the entrance complete with items piled against each other.?.  If that's what they choose to showcase by the front door, then I'm afraid to ask what they might be showcasing in the kitchen where I can't see. 

The buffet was as far from the area we were seated as possible, which I thought as weird since the place wasn't full.  Again- what was the reason (that I don't know) for this?  The selection was miserable complete with mismatched hand written signs that didn't coordinate with what was in the dish.  The Riaita had some sort of round orange colored balls in it that gave it an oddly sweet taste = yuck!  We had to chase the only waiter down to get our drinks half way through our meal and then it was a canned coke?  Really?  When we walk to the register to pay, the same waiter asked how things were and then asked us to please return.  Clearly they're struggling a bit, because successful restaurants don't usually have to beg people to return... the food and ambiance should do that on it's own.

I realize there aren't a ton of Indian places to choose from, but there are certainly enough to bypass this one, which would be my recommendation to everyone."}
{"text":"Edible, but not really recommended for the lunch buffet. Limited selection, more bland than flavorful and no level of spice in either the meat or vegetarian dishes. The naan and rice were very good. Friendly owner and the restaurant was clean. Decor was sparse and restaurant had pretty loud Indian music, but it added a little welcome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great Indian food. I had the buffet here for dinner tonight. I have eaten at several Indian restaurants in Charlotte and I feel like Jaipur has the best food.  Most of the dishes on the buffet had a good amount of flavor.  The atmosphere leaves a little to be desired, but I see food as much more important."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Not the best atmosphere - the place is laid out rather oddly, but meh... I'm here for the food (the wife would not approve, take note atmosphere junkies).

I had the lamb saag, which was very enjoyable - but it was not the same as I'd expect from most other indian places, be aware.  The naan was good as well.  

Service was mediocre, about what I expect from a small indian joint.

Oh - I went thinking that the buffet would be available for dinner, but it was not.  Slow night? Does it not run at night?  Not sure, I'm just visiting, but be aware, you may not get a buffet.

I'll return, most definitely!"}
{"text":"This review is for their dinner. 

I was hankering for Indian food, like it was a day ending in -day. Jaipur happened to be on my route home that day (thanks Yelp!), so I decided to give it a try. I called my order in and the man who picked up was very polite and very nice, and answered my questions with some good suggestions on their dishes. I know my popular Indian dishes, but I always like to try something new. 

The place is super easy to find. It's in one of those big shopping plazas, but their sign is huge and glowing - hard to miss. Bonus is that parking is a total breeze. So I rode that breeze right on in and was greeted immediately. My order was ready right on time, and they were very careful to wrap and place everything so nothing would spill. 

On to the food...
Naan was awesome. Perfect mix of light and dense with this bread. Nobody likes a super dense naan. It should be fluffy and easy to tear with one hand if you're eating properly!

The dishes were wonderful. The meat was cooked perfectly and fall-off-the-bone tender, in the case of the goat curry that I ordered. I'm not a fan of goat, unless it's cooked Indian-style. Then suddenly goat is the top of my food wants. The sauces were 3/5. I would have liked to see (and taste) more spices in the food, but it was more than acceptable. I think I was most impressed by the abundance of food in the sauce. There are few things more disappointing than a bowl brimming with tikka masala only to have like 5 pieces of meat in it. I was very happy with the portion sizes here. Definitely worth the money!

Besides the spices, the one thing Jaipur could improve on is to have brown rice as an option. I know that's not typical for restaurants, but a few of the other places in Charlotte do offer brown rice. hint hint...  Otherwise, for their dishes alone, I would not hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business? This has been by far the worst experience I've ever had at an Indian restaurant. 

I came for lunch buffet with a friend since my usual spot decided to start closing on Mondays. The reviews here were hit or miss but for $8, figured I wouldn't lose much. 

Soon as we walked in, a man on the phone motioned us to a table with a sweep of his arm. No greeting, no questions, still talking on the phone, just a finger pointing us to a table. He poured us each a glass of water but never asked if we wanted anything else. Guess cause he was too busy on the phone which he stayed on the duration of our visit. 

We walked up to the buffet stand and immediately looked back at the man with a \"You've got to be kidding me\" expression on our faces. There was rice, 2 pieces of naan, 4 veggie dishes and 3 chicken dishes. That's it. That's the buffet. The rest of the buffet dish spots were empty. I thought, for $8, I'll just eat my fill. Now on to the food itself. 

Veggie curry was mush. No flavor, just a bland sauce with over cooked veggies you couldn't tell apart. The cauliflower dish was also mushy. There was a spinach and mushroom dish I've never seen before. It was not good. Mushrooms were gummy. Now the chicken - there was chicken masala that lacked cream and was watered down. Seriously, it was just orange water. The chicken curry was a weird shade of brownish green, not the vibrant red you'd expect. Then the tandoori chicken - bland. It had a reddish hue but no flavor, not even salt. The meat was dry and you could tell it's leftovers from a previous day. The naan was made fresh but it was thick and gummy. I've had better naan from Walmart. We asked if there was any samosas and he brought us each one. The potatoes were mushy (seems to be a theme) and again, there was no flavor. Even the tamarind and mint sauces were watered down. 

Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, we went to pay and was told the total is $21. For water and two $8 plates, it didn't add up right. That's when we were told there's an extra charge for the samosas. We weren't told that it when it was ordered, only when we went to pay. That's crazy. We left feeling unsatisfied and won't ever be back there again."}
{"text":"This was quite an interesting restaurant. I came shortly after 5:30, right after they re-opened for dinner. The decor/ambiance immediately tell you that you're in an Indian restaurant, specifically the smell of incense and the Indian music which I like as part of the experience.

The menu boasts a wide variety of chicken, lamp, seafood and vegetarian dishes as well as an assortment of Indian breads to go with your meal. I ordered the Bhindi Bhaji which is a spiced sauteed okra with tomatoes and onions. It was perfect with the tandoori roti bread (buttered, of course). All of that with the basmati rice was more than enough. My regret was that I didn't order it spicier (he suggested medium but probably did so assuming that I couldn't handle it - will have to correct that next time) - if you like spicy, be sure to convey that. Glad I came and hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Great food, fast delivery, reasonable price BUT the \"spiciness\" was a little overwhelming. I ordered the chicken madras and at first bite I thought \"this is amazing\" but then came the heat. I am not one to be overly sensitive to spice but this was last my level of enjoyment.  I wish the meal description would have noted the level of spice and/or given me the chance to choose my spice level.  I really wanted to keep eating this delicious food but i couldn't make it through the spices meal.

Takeaway: if you like spice, then this is five stars for you

Suggestion: company might want to update dish descriptions to note spice levels online and on grubhub."}
{"text":"Went to the lunch menu and it was A-OK. I like Indian food and not Indian food that caters to Americans. I make my own Indian food at home and know the consistencies and the spices quite well. The lunch was sparse, the waiter friendly and attentive, but the food was meh. I only went there because I noticed that the lunch menu was decent priced, but when I got read y to pay he charged me a different amount than what their website states. I did not question it, but was disappointed as I do not like it if business owners do not update their websites as it feels like it is luring people in for a different price. If you are craving Indian food like me sometimes, do not waste your time and maybe head somewhere else. I wish I could support this place, particularly, because the owner/waiter is such a sweetie, but this place has seen better times and is def. not my favorite."}
{"text":"Woah, this is some well cooked Indian food! Eating here really highlighted the fact that we've been eating some slipshod Indian lately. Jaipur Indian Restaurant is the real deal. The Bengali chef is not cutting any corners - everything is spiced to perfection with the right balance of heat, spice, and oil. 

The masala chai tasted like something you'd buy off of a chai wallah in the streets of any city in India. Very few people actually make real Indian chai in the US, so, this is pretty special.

The meats were succulent, melt in your mouth texture.

As an added bonus, our buffet came with 2 pieces of fresh of the tandoor naan and 2 potato dosas.

Service and ambiance are fair. The hole-in-the-wall atmosphere was actually charming in it's own way and authentically Indian. Very excited to become a regular at Jaipur."}
{"text":"Amazing buffet.... Even on Friday nights! The tandori chicken is tender and just right. My favorite item on the menu us the lamb kabob... EXTRA spicy, and then wrap it in the chili nan! The service is always friendly."}
{"text":"We lived in the Charlotte area 5 years ago and used to frequent Jaipur almost weekly.  We loved the food!  We were in town for the weekend and stopped in for lunch for old times sake.  The food is just as awesome now as it was then.  We highly recommend Jaipur!"}
{"text":"The good thing is they deliver to uptown hotels. Nothing special to boast about the food."}
{"text":"Great food. Very tasty. Buffet wasnt a very big spread. However everything was so tasty. The tandoori chicken was especially awesome. Big place."}
{"text":"Great buffet, with delicious vegetarian and meat selections (I tried all of them)."}
{"text":"My experience with this restaurant prompted me to join yelp and write my first review.  I just moved to uptown Charlotte and am dealing with some injuries (fractured distal femur and grade 2 ankle sprain) that has me ordering delivery some nights when I don't feel like preparing food or picking up.

With that being said, I don't think any restaurant or delivery driver needs the backstory to justify needing food delivered to your door.  I'm in a highrise uptown, people get delivery here all the time, and the concierge accommodates and sets the elevator for drivers...etc.

For some reason this guy put up the biggest argument about parking his car with hazards on and coming up to my room.  After 4 phone calls back and forth between the delivery driver and I (one hour after I ordered because whoever took my order wasn't able to decipher Pine from Tryon -_-) he was finally feeling assured enough to get out of the car... but not before 1 last call telling me that nobody was at the front desk and that I would need to come down after all.  So I call the concierge desk, and sure enough, somebody picked up...and let the guy in the elevator.  I lied, 1 more call was made when the guy was on my floor - asking the unit number...because my having made mention of the unit number before fell on deaf ears since nobody intended to come up to begin with. lovely.

I'll spare you the exchange.  It was lackluster and almost no words spoke in our ~25 second encounter.

THE FOOD.

I ordered Paneer Tikka Masala (spicy) and a Chicken Tandoori which I ended up having to order to meet the $30 minimum for delivery.  I didn't mind, I considered it a nice meal for the following day.  Paneer was not fresh, spice was adequate, but the overall taste was not something you come to expect after having paneer tikka masala's all around the world.  The Naans were standard, it's hard to mess that up.  The chicken tandoori which I got to the same night because I considered the paneer a wash, was totally lacking in flavor - almost as if it were chicken pieces with a red coating.  I don't expect much in the way of presentation, but you can do a little better than a few onions strips and a lemon wedge.

There seemed to be a huge language barrier when calling to order as well.  Like I had to repeat my phone number about 6 times...and I'm an American born Desi - so I'm very familiar with how to flavor my american accent with some desi tongue so those native to India and not as attune to our language (our language being english) can understand.  Half way through my order he asked me where in India I'm from (I said my father is from gujarat) and then we switched to Hindi for the rest of the call.  I had an advantage and still had trouble...yikes.

Annnyways, not ordering from there again.



Edit: One more thing.  The only other Indian restaurant I've tried in Charlotte in my ~1 month here so far is Copper.  

So here's my review for Copper:  

I had the Paneer Tikka Masala.  WOW.  ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place. The buffet is the way to go If you aren't sure about the place. Sunday for lunch is good because it isn't packed but they say they open at 12 but don't be alarmed if the front door isn't unlocked until 12:30 unless you call and tell them you are waiting at the door."}
{"text":"It's not the prettiest place you've ever been, and it's on a shady side of town, but if you like Indian food, this place is pretty darn tasty."}
{"text":"I can only attest to the lunch buffet. First of all, the price is right. After tax it is $8.75. Between this and the one on King's Drive, it's pretty much my 2 go-to for Indian lunch buffet. Jaipur has good naan, a tomato soup that goes well with them, and the little fried chickpeas patties that are very tasty. There are typically at least 4 entrees options (vegetarian & chicken mostly) plus the must have tandoori chicken. This is a solid quick lunch spot when you're craving a little Indian."}
{"text":"Jaipur is one of the best Indian spots here in Charlotte. The food is really good and it's always hot and fresh. They have lots of vegetarian and vegan options to choose from."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. The customer service is absolutely amazing and the food is heaven! We are vegetarians and this place has a large selection of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Note - The only reason this gets 2 and not 1 star is because the rating is for the service I received over the phone, and not the food itself.

    So I just arrived from Miami on business and I am starving!  I decide to take a look at the local eateries for something a little different (heck, Im not paying for it!) when I came across this place.  The prices were great, and the way the food was described left me with a need to feed.  needless to say, I was sold!
...But then..I called to place my order...and was met to the sounds of a loud Indian man talking to someone else in a language I was not familiar with... shrugged it off and gave him my details...but when I gave him my order, he simply interrupted me and said something along the lines of...\" check the menu again, and call back...we dont have that..or we dont serve that\"...he wouldnt even wait to see if I would make another choice!!!  He wanted me to hang up and check the friggin menu again!!!
 Needless to say I hung up the phone and decided to call Fortune Cookie II,.,,,better customer service over the phone, any day of the week!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great Indian restaurant. The owner was so sweet and accommodating, and made sure we always had exactly what we needed. The buffet was incredible smelling and looking-- even though we ordered off the menu, which was also great. I also enjoyed one of the best mango Lassis I have ever had! The place was also extremely clean. I will definitely make sure to come back any time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We were staying in Charlotte at a hotel, and this menu was one of the ones we grabbed from the front desk, and I am glad we did. We ordered chicken vindaloo, some chicken tikka masala, samoas an order of the naan bread. Ordered a bit late and they assured us we would have our meal within 40 minutes, and I have to tell you it was definitely worth the wait. The portion size was huge, and the food was hot and flavourful. The vindaloo had the right amount of heat, and the tikka masala, was wonderful, and there was more than enough food for a second meal, although I ate my vindaloo like it was my last meal. 

The food came with utensils, and plates, which made it all the better and I will order from here again for sure, the next time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Quite good.  I was here with a group of amigos for the Sat. evening buffet.  Good and wide selection but marked down for not-too-fresh veggies at 7 pm: this should be the prime time!  On the other hand the breads (amazing) were as fresh as could be.  overall this is a solid, though not outstanding, choice for Indian."}
{"text":"I am very upset with this place. First of all, I called and as I was ordering I told them very clearly \"not spicy\" the person on the phone said \"ok I'll make it mild.\" I said it very clearly and I have a witness at the hotel with me, \"I don't want spicy at all. No spicey!\" He said ok. \"I said neither chicken or soup I don't want it spicy please.\" He said yes. I also ordered a bottle of water. I paid $25 plus tip! I paid like $30! In return my order comes like an hour later. Rice is cold. Both chicken and soup are sooo spicy my mouth burns. I can't eat them. No water! The water I paid for didn't even come. I call and text nobody responds! Finally a guy responds and says well its Indian food it's spicy. I said I was clear I didn't want it spicy he should have told me that earlier. Then as I was saying they also forgot my water bottle, he hung up on me! hUnG up on a client who just got scammed $30 with cold rice, super spicy food and no water. I am still hungry and thirsty now. Can't sleep."}
{"text":"Only had naan and chicken vindaloo.  Pretty excellent.  Tasted just how I wanted it.  Could have used more chicken but it wasn't small.  Prices were pretty normal, food took a little long to come out.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"The buffet was very typical Indian buffet. I'm from Edison, NJ, which has a large Indian community with a great selection of food, so this one didn't meet my expectations. There were limited options in the buffet. It only had 3 veggies, 3 chickens and 2 soups along with dessert. The veggies didn't include some popular items like paneer or anything. Overall, for the price it was okay."}
{"text":"Friendly worker(only 1 person working)
Good food and variety
Drinks never run dry
Downside, décor and bathroom are scary"}
