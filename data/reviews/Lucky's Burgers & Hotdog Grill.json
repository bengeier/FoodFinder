{"text":"This is by far the best place I have eaten that sells hot dogs!! Every time we come in here the people here are always friendly and nice. Great customer service and great food as well. All I can do as recommendation for food is everything on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"Very tasty.  Looks expensive at first until you load the toppings on which makes this a very full meal.  And of course I love that I can eat here to begin with bc of the GF buns!!"}
{"text":"Anyone who reads my reviews knows service is as important to me as the food. At Lucky's both were great. Had the \"Chicago Dog\" which wasn't really one by definition, but it was oh so good! The bun was like... Whoa!  Soft and light and fluffy.just firm enough to hold the dog. Delicious! And the service. Everyone was friendly. I believe the gentleman I talked to was the owner/manager. Super friendly, knowledgeable about the product, and made me feel welcome. Will be back!!! If I would make a suggestion it'd be to have regular French fries."}
{"text":"DIY burger and hotdog toppings. Red wine marinated burger tastes like it, I liked hot dog better. Can't go wrong with waffle fries though!"}
{"text":"If you're going to charge big league prices, you need to have a big league product. Lucky's doesn't.

I had the 1/2 lb. marinated burger with cheese and bacon, and the waffle fries.

The burger was bland, with no hint of the char or crispness that a good burger needs. The bacon was thick but limp. The bun was nothing special and crumbly.

Like the bacon, the waffle fries were limp.

With a drink, my bill came to almost $18.00. The meal might have been worth half that.

If you're in the area, you can get better burgers for the same amount or less at Zinburger, In-N-Out, Five Guys, and Smashburger.

The workers were pleasant and helpful, but that doesn't save a subpar product.

I live in the area, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved my Hot dog -- got the Phoenix Dog. Bun was home made and wonderful, as was the dog!"}
{"text":"I went with my son and when i paid the bill the lady asked me if i need change from my $40 when my order was $32, and not only insist but also she said \" it only $40 do you still want change? that irritate me a lot because she even gave us a good services, was unprofessional. Food is good but these ladies in short just want tips and dont give good services, please manager check them. Thank you"}
{"text":"Lucky's Burger & Hotdog Grill is amazing.  Their menu consists of all natural ingredients, house made sirloin hot dogs, and possibly the best burger I have ever had. The burgers and dogs are served on house made buns, and from potato and tapioca flour. No bleached flour here. If you're looking for a healthy hearty meal, that also manages to capture the feel of a roadside diner, Lucky's is your place."}
{"text":"Sad to say, this place has changed owners, and the quality and pride of the food has gone down hill. 

I was shocked to learn the old owners just up and sold it moving back to Texas since I had just eaten there two weeks prior to them selling, and the one woman owner was so gung-ho about the new pretzel buns they were going to be introducing. 

I am very curious to know why they just up and left, but needless to say, the new owner, though very nice, does not hold himself to the same fresh, unprocessed, homemade food standard as the old owner, so there is really nothing setting this place apart from other restaurants. 

The new owner changed the waffle fries to seasoned waffle fries, and they are pretty gross since the old ones were to die for. 

The chili is out of a can, whereas, the old owner used to make it fresh, and even the buns are different now. 

It's unfortunate because this used to be my favorite place to eat, but now, it has lost its appeal to me."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in both the service and the food.  Burger, fries, and a drink came to $16.  Cheap bun that fell apart, cold burger, and OK waffle fries. They said they were \"too busy\" to put 1/2 Garlic and 1/2 Cajun salt on the fries.  Seriously?  All they do is sprinkle the flavored salt on them after they're cooked.  As several others have mentioned, for the high prices this place is NOT worth visiting."}
{"text":"On my 3rd visit I enjoyed the Wine Burger. Very tasty! I encourage you to try it. Yum!"}
{"text":"Person taking order was friendly and appeared to take order correctly, we asked for no mustard and jalape√±o sauce on our Sonoran hotdogs but when we received the order it was covered in both of those ingredients.  The staff appeared pretty stressed out so it didn't feel worth it to get it resolved.  Bill was pretty high too considering what we were getting and the place wasn't running air conditioning so be careful on a hot day here"}
{"text":"Super good! Everything from the service to the fried pickles were amazing.

Pros
1. They use local, grass-fed beef from Cave Creek, AZ
2. Amazing customer service: knowledgable, friendly, and caring.
3. Fried pickles - try them and you'll see what I'm talking about
4. Help yourself topping bar with everything from homemade coleslaw to pickle sauce
5. Gluten free

Cons
1. That I don't live closer to Lucky's"}
{"text":"I had a Yelp Deal so I invited a friend & her 2 kids, thinking $50 would be plenty for hamburgers and fries for our group of 7.  Our bill came to almost $100, that's almost $15 per person!! Now, the owners were extremely accommodating and the food was good overall, locally sourced,  made special, no nitrates,  etc, but we probably we won't be returning based on the price point alone. Might be good for a date night, but not large group."}
{"text":"**update**
Second time here to give it a second chance and brought my son who loves Chicago style hot dogs. Clean place, fast and friendly service. Was super bummed since the one thing I really enjoyed last time was the plain waffle fries that they no longer have. The owner was cool and said they have seasoned waffle fries which I told him I am not a fan of and he made me a couple to taste - nice but I still don't like em. Also apparently in the last week he became the new owner thus the change. My son says his Chicago dog was not bad but he can get the same at Costco for cheaper since it wasn't a true Chicago dog. Fun if you live in the area but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were going to see a movie and were looking to grab some food beforehand. As we passed by, the owner came out and shook our hands and asked if we wanted a 25 cent hot dog for their grand opening. Hell yes. 

The owner explained that the dogs and buns were gluten free and made with no hydrogenated oils which was huge for me, since I have a sensitive gut. My boyfriend was happy because Cajun fries. 

Overall service was great, the owner was enthusiastic and excited to make our experience good, and the food was delicious. A bit expensive for the combos but eh. It's north scottsdale."}
{"text":"All I can say is oh boy!! Please stop in and have an out of this world tasting Chili Dog! I am so glad I found this joint."}
{"text":"Excellent hot dogs, hamburgers and fries!  Service was wonderful too!  We were treated like good friends!  Perfect place to eat before or after a movie.  I can't wait to return.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I found this joint while looking on Yelp, and decided to give it a try. Walking in, it was a very friendly atmosphere and clean. The owners were the ones that helped us, and were very welcoming. We both got the half pound burger, and it was marinated in red wine, and it was actually quite incredible. We ordered the original and Cajun style waffle fries, which were excellent. We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Best Wine burger and regular burgers in Phoenix. It is a new place that we hope succeeds! Our son loves the hot dog and the waffle fries are incredible! Delicious, high quality food, reasonable prices and the nicest owner. Great ingredients for a successful business! It is a must have!"}
{"text":"Ok to start off the staff is very friendly and the service is quick. I ordered the Chicago hotdog but it was far from what I was expecting, this hotdog reminded me of something that you could get at Costco for a dollar 50. It wasn't bad by any means but in the neighborhood of six dollars just for the hotdog, I was expecting Vienna or something similar. The hotdog was boiled then grilled, the sesame seed bun however was not warm it was room temperature.  It was almost 20 dollars for two hotdogs two drinks and one order of fries. This was my first time here but apparently the business is under new ownership and by a very friendly owner who said his name was Juan.  They no longer have plain waffle fries which my friends raved about.
I understand getting into the flow of owning a new business can be difficult. Given the fact that this place is new I might give it another shot, however it will be some time before I return again."}
{"text":"I work near this place and when I saw that it was open I was excited to have a new burger option.  I went in and ordered a 1/4 lb burger, fries, and a drink not looking at the prices.  I was shocked when the girl said the total was $14 and when I asked her to check again she said that was the correct price and that they sell all the items separately which is why it came out to that much.

I can say the food here is good.  The burger was very tasty (meat marinated in red wine apparently) and the fries were good but price was high to say the least.  I know this place is close to Scottsdale but I think even Scottsdale folks will have a hard time swallowing a $14 burger combo.

I hope the owner can come up with some lunch specials especially since many of the lunch time eaters are hungry office workers like me looking for a deal."}
{"text":"EAT HERE! GREAT first experience!! 
Above and beyond for us! THANK YOU! 

 I happened upon this great grill via groupon. I tend to look for a good deal to fall back on for when money runs low, being a student here from California. After school the other day, maybe Tuesday, I called in my order of two Kansas bbq bacon dogs for myself, a pretzel for my strict vegetarian girlfriend and an order of garlic fries for us to share. Since close to closing and being further away than I had anticipated, we left right after my call. 

  We arrive and I smell delicious bacon n beef. Whoever buys for this business cares about quality. As soon as we walk in we are greeted politely by who we hope is the owner because if not he deserves to be LOL. He quickly informs us that unfortunately he is out of pretzels. Also just as quickly he offered us quite an upgrade for free, the veggie burger of the house. Which I MUST admit as a man that loves a real burger, it's a GOOD burger, very tasty and HUGE! Add to it free reign of the toppings bar and BAM! GOOD! He also kindly included a complimentary order of his fried pickle chips w sauce, GREAT! All for the presumed inconvenience, which really wasn't so considering his great politeness and accommodating nature in response to no pretzels. The dogs were great, I personally reheated the fries in the oven later and enjoyed. We were both heavily impressed! 

  I hope this needs no forgiveness for saying but God bless this guy in this business! He's a GOOD guy with great food, EAT HERE!
And sir. .THANK YOU for the great experience, you made a difference for the better in both of our days! It's the little things that count huge and this guy knows it."}
{"text":"Really fun place with great burgers and hot dogs! Owner is super friendly and explained the menu to us really well. Good fried pickles and yummy milkshakes. Great bite before a movie!"}
{"text":"Highlight was Delicious cheeseeeeeburger with tender and flavorful brisket on top with Carmelized onions and peppers! The sauce they put on this bun doesn't allow you to toss it and just eat the meat - it's mouth watering and a unique compliment that makes it one of the best meals! The fries are the right texture of crispy and the condiment bar - well that is just too extensive to mention except to make sure you try the pickles!  Didn't see waffle fries on the menu but the sweet potato fries are DEFInately worth the upgrade."}
{"text":"Small place with a fab vegetarian burger option. Liked that you could pick your own dressings and garnish. House sauce is tasty and their veggie burger is really good, and hearty! Waffle fries were good too and nothing was overly greasy."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly but didn't quite see what made this place so great. The bread fell apart which made s huge mess 
Not worth to spend 10.00 for a burger. I was expecting a melt in your mouth flavors and not a crumble in your mouth and fall apart. The Sonoran dog was ok not the best but good. The waffle fries were good 
They do have a selection in the bar and you can add whatever you want I just personally wasn't a fan and don't think I will come back. The wine was a little overwhelming and didn't make the burger taste that great again this is just my experience and if you like that over powering wine taste than you might like the burger."}
{"text":"Finally came by to check out the action here and was not disappointed. Located near the movie theater with a great tasting selection of Hot Dogs, Burgers, Chicken Strips, homemade Veggie burgers and several yummy Sides and Appetizers. They even have Dessert.

Ordered the Chicago Dog with everything and a Chili Dog with Cheese. Could not resist getting some Cajun Waffle Fries to satisfy my boyish appetite. They have a killer toppings bar that comes complimentary with every meal. There must have been a couple of dozen or so freshly chopped or created extras that go great on your entree or on the side like yours truly. They also have large selection of sauces including a homemade Pickle Sauce. So good!

Everything was delicious and served with a big smile. The owners are very nice and are good at explaining all the different items that they have to offer. I was very pleased to find out how much love they put into creating a fun atmosphere as well as having some nice healthy eating options. They even have Gluten Free choices.

Looking forward to coming back for one of their Red Wine Burgers with some tasty Apple Smoked Bacon. I had the chance to sample a couple of pieces of them bad boys and it was simply delightful.

This is a cool and fun place to bring the family and kids. It is not super cheap and a little on the high side compared to some of the larger restaurants chains. Then again you have to remember the giant toppings bar that is FREE and that you are not charged an extra fee per topping like some places. So make sure to take advantage of it. DOING MY HAPPY DANCE!

{"text":"First time today I went to Lucky's with my dad. We both loved it! Clean. Good service. Fresh, fresh food. Just a great experience overall. Will DEFINITELY go back. Thanks Lucky's!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Family owned and so friendly and welcoming.  We walked in the door and were greeted promptly followed by a great explanation of the high quality of their food since we had never been there before.  I have to say I wouldn't go anywhere for a burger OR a dog but here after our experience.  Anywhere else I loved getting burgers from doesn't even sound enticing now! And for sure there can't be anywhere in the state where you could get a hot dog that tastes this good and is made with sirloin! Even the buns are homemade and healthy!  I highly recommend, everything was fresh and delicious and prepared quickly."}
{"text":"The location, super cute. Nice staff, very personable. The food...that's the issue. First, I will say I'd try it again - they're new and still need to find their groove. I got the Phoenix hot dog. The hot dog was good, toppings were good, the bread left much to be desired. I felt it was dense and dry. They have a toppings bar that's got good variety. I really liked that touch. The waffle fries were WONDERFUL. I would say I'd go back again just for the fries. They were salted to perfection, hot and absolutely delicious. My friend and I can say that was our favorite part of the meal. My friend got the wine burger and we weren't fans. It had a tang to it that we weren't expecting and same issue with the bun. Long story short, give it a try - stick to hot dogs and definitely get the waffle fries."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try off a groupon, and glad I did. I met the owner, Yuan, and he and Chris took care of me...very nice guys. The place has been open for about a year and prides itself on quality and fresh ingredients. I ordered the Wagyu burger, which is described as Kobe beef and a little pricey, but they do offer a 1/3 and 1/2# burger, as well as hot dogs. The burger was chargrilled and served plain with a whole bar of fresh fixings you build yourself. I went with the standard - ketchup, mayo, mustard, raw onion, LT, but added a little relish and slaw...Awesome. Tasted like a burger I just grilled in the backyard. The fries looked good but I opted for onion rings - delicious!  Light on the batter, crispy, not too greasy, and when you bite them the onion doesn't pull all the way out - Great sign for a good ring. Washed it down with a soda. Only wish they had beer. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing corn dogs! Management is so friendly and provides such a relaxing spot to have a quick bite. I frequent this place for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"This was the second time eating at this establishment and neither I nor my partner were thrilled about today's experience. The food was subpar for the prices.  The New Yorker I received would have upset a true New Yorker."}
{"text":"This place was a tiny little place for a great grilled hotdog or burger. I loved it. The have all the sides you want, willing to  change it up a bit if ya need to. Reasonably priced. Love the decor, made this native Az girl happy. I'd definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"Lucky to have this place!  Locally sourced, unpretentious and yummy.  My kids consume the burgers and dogs in record time.  Marisa and I love ours too.  She always gets the Paris Texas Red Yam Fries.  I get the great waffle fries.  Hamburger is marinated 24 hours in red wine.  Toppings are great, be sure to ask for grilled onions.  Never new red chili paste can really make a burger.  The mayonnaise-free slaw is great by itself or as a topping.

I'm sure to lose my Duke status after others discover it."}
{"text":"Ok, I have a confession to make, I love hot dogs.  I don't eat them very often, because I LOVE hot dogs.  I have not had a hot dog in over three years, then I read about Lucky's and I wanted to check it out.  I have had two hot dogs in one week.  I feel so guilty, but they were so delicious.  I love that you can custom dress them the way you like.  Once they grill them, they hand them to you and you go to their \"salad bar\" type topping area.  The mayo free slaw was super yummy.  I also had the Paris Texas yams and the waffle fries.  Yes, I had a meal that required more than two hours at the gym, but it was well worth it.  My little boy wolfed down his hamburger.  They marinate the meat for 24 hours, so it is very flavorful.  I want to try the veggie burger, the way the owner described it, sounded so incredible appetizing.  She said it is her blend of quinoa, brown rice, yams and something else I don't remember.  When the kids are done eating, they get a free ice cream cone.   This kind of meal is an indulgence for me, and I am glad it is so close to my home."}
{"text":"This is a cool local burger and dog joint with a retro theme.
I got the bacon wrapped polish dog.  It was terrific!
The waffle fries were very good, but the lady at the counter suggested dipping them in the pickle sauce (???) - DO IT!  Wow!  Who'dathunk it?  Really good.
The complementary condiment bar includes watermelon - what?  

Can't wait to go back - actually, might just go tonight!"}
{"text":"Had a great and tasty first time at Luckys. Must try's are the Sonoran Dog and Phoenix Dog."}

{"text":"This place is really great. I loved the twist of salt with the cheese. It is very deliciously amazing. It is also healthy. If you haven't been there, then you should go."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. A great local spot. I tried just the Lucky Dog and it was top notch. I also got the loaded fry masterpiece and it was to die for. The owner was so nice and friendly he greeted us, checked on us to be sure the food was to our standards and even shared the ingredients with us. I think it's great that he chose to use the healthy options. I was so excited to hear that they had Thrifty Ice Cream. I live down the street from here, I can't wait to go back for more food."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this restaurant after visiting the Penske Racing Museum it was very good , we only wanted a snack as we weren't super hungry. So we got Hot Dogs and they tasted very good , if we have time I definitely want to go back and try the red wine marinated burgers. The cook was amazingly friendly , gave our son a free scoop of ice cream and a cool chefs hat. Also explained to us all the different combinations of burgers and hot dogs they would make for us seemed like lots of possibilities will definitely go back. The decor was great with vintage signs Awesome !!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, hotdogs and waffle fries.  The red wine burger, Chicago & NY dogs were all fabulous. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and I had an overall great experience. Very friendly and inviting. They are a little expensive and my food was a bit over cooked. I think once the dial it in they will be fine. I will defiantly give them a second try. Great concept."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! The food is delicious and healthy (and my kids ate all of their food!), and the family that owns the place is just super sweet.  I went with my parents and my two toddlers and had a great meal. Best of all, it was surprisingly affordable. The owner came out and chatted with my kids and really just made the entire experience pleasant!"}
{"text":"Had the sonorian dog which was very good, the wine burger is very good also and does taste like it has soaked in a lot of wine over night.  The half pounder wine burger is rather costly so try the smaller one out 1st.  I am going to keep trying other dogs as time permits.   Garlic Crosscut fries are very good,  they could be more done so ask for well done next time.  The dogs are really designer type combo's..... the condiment bar with all you can eat house slaw is good but little bland nothing celery salt can't remedy with pepper.  The house pickles made here in AZ are very good and unique from all other dog shops in town."}
{"text":"Had a Chicago dog yesterday, it was average at best. The problem is I paid with a credit card. I received a email later in the day with my receipt . How did they get my email??? I think this is a privacy issue . I never gave them my email. I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"I've sat on this review for five days because I wanted to be very careful that it was honest and accurate.  I absolutely loved the service, staff and owner (5-star) however felt their hot dogs were only slightly above average (3+-star).  I went with two elderly friends because they were both having a hot-dog-craving; we each had a different dog (Chili Cheese Dog, Chicago Dog & a special request Dog).  We also split a very large order of fries.  None of us tried their hamburgers.  We all had their excellent Coleslaw (self-serve, all that you want).

When I first walked in I saw their large assortment of condiments (that you can put on yourself) and it reminded me of the Hot Dog Stop which used to be located a couple miles south of here, but it closed unexpectedly several months ago.  This couple (owners) used to be associated with the Hot Dog Stop and opened Lucky's shortly afterward, which explains the similarities.

All their staff and the owner (that I met) were wonderful.  They went above and beyond helping me with my 80-90 year old friends (with walker's etc.).  

My 3+-star hot dog rating has to come with a self-admission, and one that could possibly disqualify me from an unbiased judgment of hot dogs, but I grew up in Detroit (as did one of my elderly friends) and we can't help but compare hot dogs to what we grew up eating, which is probably unfair.  These were Detroit Coney Island hot dogs (i.e., from Lafayette and American Coney Island's - owned by two Greek brothers 100 years ago and located adjacent to each other in downtown Detroit).  I believe that others base their opinions (and standards) on what they had as they grew up (i.e., New York and Chicago).

Conclusion - I loved the staff, liked the food, and this place deserves more customers than were in there while we were there.  I hope they do well and I will go back.  My heart would \"love\" to give them a 5-star rating but in all honesty I felt their hot dog's deserved only 3+-star.  Therefore I'm going with the skew and giving them a 4-star."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp..... Your info shows that they are open today. Not only are the closed today, but they have been closed for good for a while now. Way to stay updated."}
{"text":"I have to give them a one based on my experience. 
We ordered 2 decent sounding burgers and two drinks. 
I offered him my still valid Groupon on its expiration day.  He said that meant that it had expired the day before.  
I left. I contacted groupon. 
They said I was right. 
But the thief owner of Lucky's had redeemed it and marked it as used just as he was telling me it couldn't be used. 

Classy. You stole $13 from me.  

I'll laugh when you go out of business.


Update: These thieves went out of business just as I knew they would. Ha ha."}
{"text":"The chili burger has legit, no-beans chili and the patties are fresh as can be. Friendly service...like a neighbor! Off menu corn dog? Yes please. Only complaint was the ranch dressing...needs to be homemade.

All in all, a great little place that I will come back to. I mean, they do have a Reuben that needs to be tried!"}
{"text":"My wife had a grilled hot dog and sweet potato fries while I had a Chicago Hot Dog, waffle fries and a soda all for $21.91.

The food was good, but I was shocked by the cost of our lunch. I guess those prices might stick when the captive movie going crowd is looking for a quick bite before the movie but this local knows where there's a better bang for the buck at some other eateries in the area."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I just went there for the first time as a result of a groupon and then we saw a special on the place, and we all had burgers, To start off the lady at the counter was as pleasant as can be, she explained everything and her attitude was enough to make me come back but the burgers were flavorful and juicy and they provide all the fixins for you to put on as you see fit, they even have some self created sauces that are very good, like there pickle sauce and red onion sauce. I gave it 5 out of 5 stars but personally the bun I was not impressed with but not enough to shy you away."}
{"text":"Locally sourced meat, homemade bread and tons of toppings. This place is awesome. Hot dogs are angus meat with no bad stuff. Boom! Red wine burger is ok, but I'd stick to the dogs"}
{"text":"It feels like a family generated labor of love which is cool. Solid burgers.  Price points are too high and the marketing is a little sporadic.  Hopefully with some refinement and polish and this place can establish itself as a solid lunch offering."}
{"text":"There is so many good things to say about this restaurant.   The owner was behind the register and she instantly meant us with a smile and explained the entire menu making several suggestions.   My wife went with the 1/4 pound burger that is marinated in red wine and she loved the taste.  As a side she got battered mushrooms that she dipped in a pickle sauce that the owner personal makes. 

I got the lucky dog which is made with their own spices and Angus beef.  Of course I had to add bacon and it was so scrumptious and the fact that everything is made in house it has none of the extra junk that makes you feel over full when your done.   After you get your food there is a full condiment bar at your disposal.   I was amazed on how clean the bar and restaurant was,  normally you would see condiments all over the place but this was spot less.   They even found out that we were just visiting and even gave us hiking suggestions.  When we return back to Scottsdale this is going to be a definite stop."}
{"text":"First off, the people here are extremely nice and friendly. they make good suggestions and make you feel so welcome. I was referred here by a coworker who says their hotdogs are amazing. I don't like hotdogs so I went with the Lucky #14 burger. their burger was really good. the bun was kind of dense so I ended up just removing the top part of it. I really like that they let you add whatever and how ever much of condiments you want with a bar set up for both the hotdogs and burgers. for $3.95 they give you a TON of waffle fries. I split them with someone and still didn't finish the whole thing. overall, they are quite delicious. I might try a different bun next time I go but other than that my experience was really good :) recommend if you want a good burger and either don't like chain restaurants or you want to support local businesses."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! One of the best burgers I had. The garlic waffle fries and fried pickles are also amazing! I recommend the pickle sauce! What's even better here is the staff. They are so welcoming as soon as you walk in. They go out of their way to make sure you have what you need. I truly appreciated their kindness. My husband and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So Disappointed :((  ------ We were so super stoked to come and enjoy an awesome lunch with this establishment. We're in town for the Phoenix Film Festival and just wanted a bite to eat. My children were invited by one of the employees into the Hot Dog stand to receive 20% off the bill because they saw the boys advertising for their film outside the restaurant and appreciated and respected the hustle. When we decided to dine with a dozen other filmmakers, the owner was so rude and his obnoxious behavior implied that my boys weren't telling the truth about the 20% discount for dining in and didn't honor the kind gesture. He literately came around from the register and got in my face angrily to continue that he could not honor a 20% discount that one of his self chosen employees had volunteered. Needless to say we we're starved, but had to leave this establishment due to principle. At the end of the day, the guy embarrassed himself in front of his employees and patrons over $20 and lost out of $120 worth of business."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Owner Chris is on point both with food and service. Working alone New Years Day out of the goodness of his heart and still blew us away! The burgers were amazing. This place is in my top 3 burger shops."}

{"text":"The people who work their take pride in their food, the owner explained all of the effort to get the right quality ingredients.  I found their hot dogs tasty, although I prefer thinner dogs rather than thick dogs.  The flavour of the burgers are great.  And they let you put all types of condiments on your food.  Their shakes are amazing, using the best ice cream.  Their prices were reasonable

{"text":"Close to Harkins movies at scottsdale and mayo, it's not easily visible from the street, but once you taste it your tastebuds won't soon forget. 
I love the nostalgic interior and it's clean and inviting. It can get expensive which others have commented on. However you are getting a top notch experience with fresh ingredients and commercial worthy looking food. From locally sourced and healthy ingredients comes one of the best burgers I have ever had. Marinated for 24 hours in red wine, it's juicy without being greasy or dripping and holds together perfectly on the bun with exceptional flavor. The Cajun waffle fries are my favorite side.
Hubby liked the Chicago dog which is gluten, nitrate and msg free.
We have been here twice and the quality and taste shines thru.
Worthy of more then a passing glance and certainly calorie worthy."}
{"text":"Last night was my second visit.  The first time we went, a month or 2 ago, we were on our way to the movies and needed a quick bite to eat.  At that time we thought the burgers and waffle fries were pretty awesome. The man behind the counter couldn't stop talking about the high quality of their food. Last night we brought my husband.  While the burgers were about the same the fries seemed to have been from a frozen bag, terrible!! Not to mention I only got a handful of them . I tried the hot dog which was okay. No sure if place has changed hands but was pretty disappointed.  Nice staff and all, but definitely not the same. Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"Had cheeseburger, onion rings and yam fries. Nothing tasted special. Not much flavor. Overpriced."}
{"text":"My first time in. I read reviews on the burgers and dogs. I opted to go with a dog, onion rings and chocolate shake. The meal was good, hot dig a little salty, but good. Onion rings were good, a little greasy and the shake was great! My bf went with the half lb burger with chz &bacon. I'd read the wine burgers were outstanding. He and I would have to disagree, the wine made them taste a little funky.  He didn't finish it. Cajun waffle fries were tasty as well as the caramel shake my daughter had. It Appeared it was a husband, wife ownership. The woman was very friendly, told us about the menu in detail and was pleasant. It was a little pricey-$38 for 2 dogs, one burger,2 sides &3 shakes, good thing we had a groupon to cut $20 off.  I might return, not sure it wowed me enough. The dogs and burgers were fair in price, its when you start adding on the sides. The top your own dog/burger bar was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Kids like the waffle fries. They offered to make my son a burger that was not seasoned with wine. Good spot to go before a movie."}
{"text":"Wish I would have had the burger instead of the Chicago Dog. :(
Onion rings were good, but is pretty pricey for this type of food."}
{"text":"After looking for a hot dog place open on a Sunday we finally came across this one. So we each ordered a hot dog - but they only had one bun left- he offered the hot dog on a hamburger bun or we could wait until the other person came back with buns. So we ended up getting one hot dog and a hamburger. The hot dog was supposed to be grilled but it had no grill marks and was lukewarm- and large like a ballpark dog. (Which I truly don't like) the hamburger was so-so. The guy was quite nice, he gave us free fries and drinks - the sweet potato fries were a little soggy. But I won't be back - I honestly don't think they'll make it here long. Wish we had some great Chicago hotdog places on the north side of town!"}
{"text":"Really, really good quality of.food and service, I will be coming back at least once a week, the quality of the hot dogs is the best I've ever had in my life, you can tell the dogs are.made of black Angus beef. Ive eaten great hot dogs all over the east coast and this is the best ive ever had. Definitely give this classic American restaurant a try."}
{"text":"So I bought a Groupon to try this place out. It is kinda like a portillos is not fast food but it's not fill on sit down restaurant. It's a small business, the owner takes your order and cooks your meal. I ordered the Chicago sandwich the beef was super juicy but not too much so that the bread is overly soaked. I enjoyed it. My mom ordered the Sonoran dog,  it was different from what I'm used to seeing in tucson but she loved it. Sweet potato fries were ok. Salted caramel milkshake was yummy. They have a condiments bar to choose toppings for your burger, dog or sandwich which is pretty cool. I will definitely be back to try out other items. Got my eye on the western burger. The decor is retro which is neat,  I liked the ambience."}
{"text":"I volunteer with the Phoenix Film Festival each year and when we saw this place open we were pretty excited.

The owners have been more than welcoming to everyone that has been in there and continue to do so with each visit. 

I LOVE their food.  My recent favorite was the Lucky's Phoenix Dog with a side of Louisana Cajun Waffle Fries.  You can't go wrong there! 

The atmosphere is great and if you've lived in Arizona your whole life, you will see some great memories on the walls.  I just live down the street so I try to eat here once every week or so.

Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance of my apartment. I was craving a burger so I decided to go here. I was not disappointed! I just ordered a regular cheeseburger but with the topping bar choices was able to make it into a delicious one with all my favorite toppings! I ordered the sweet potato fries and they were just as good. I'm looking forward to my next trip where I plan on trying one of their hot dogs."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, friendly personalized service.  You gotta love/try their pickle sauce. The burgers and dogs are really good! The slight negatives keeping it from 5 stars in my opinion are pricey fries/sides that came out less than hot..."}
{"text":"Not bad, but nothing special. The wine marinade on the burger is not bad, but a bit of a vinegary aftertaste (which for me is a no thank you, but others who love vinegar may actually really enjoy it!) I do want to go back and try the hot dogs. Burger took a while to come out, and fried mushrooms were a bit mushy. Think I just need to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Food was yummy, service great, decent price for a grilled burger, fries just right.  Would definately go back."}
{"text":"Worst food ever!! My husband and I felt like trying a new burger joint. Big mistake! French fries were way undercooked almost raw, how do you mess up french fries?? My veggie burger (pretty much brown rice formed into a patty) fell apart completely, so gross. We asked for cheese on our burgers, cheese slices weren't even melted completely, still cold. I was excited to try the waffle fries everyone has been raving about, they aren't even on the menu! The only good thing about this place was the \"pickle sauce\" and the condiment bar. I never post reviews, but I felt the need to warn anyone thinking about trying this place. My husband had a regular beef burger and said it was alright but 5 Guys was better."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite and stumbled upon Lucky's. I had a Phoenix hot dog which was different but tasty. My boyfriend had the 1/2 burger. Burgers was defiantly over done. I had a bite of it. It had good flavor, but couldn't get past it being over done.    Waffle fry's were average. There were lots of topping to choose from. I would go back again and see how the burger turns out next time."}
{"text":"the owners are great, place and food is amazing.   Their Hot Dogs and Hamburgers are great."}
{"text":"We had a large party after seeing a movie with 7 kids under 10 years old. We decided to try it out. The burgers are amazing,  the sides were large enough to share and were great tasting as well.  The service was so great,  they even came out to see if the kids were ready for ice cream and delivered each kid their ice cream.  I'm not really into deep fried food so it won't be a regular thing but it was a great treat!"}
{"text":"I've  eaten here a few times now, as I'm going to the Phoenix Film Festival at the Harkins next door. I'm extremely satisfied with my service and may make this a semi regular place. The food is good (I like the chili dog, chocolate shake, and ESPECIALLY the Cajun fries). The service is really great and the owners are friendly. If you're in the neighborhood, going to a movie, whatever, and you want a solid great tasting meal that won't break the bank, give them a try. Tell 'em Britt sent you and receive a question of \"who's Britt\" free of charge!"}
{"text":"After seeing this on the hot dog feature last week we decided to give it a try.  We had frequented hot dog stop previously so were looking forward to trying Lucky's. 

As we were near the door waking in, we must have looked a little uncertain, as a couple exiting the door said to us, the hot dogs are really good!  Well, we would agree with their assessment. My wife had the New Yorker, I had a chili cheese dog. As soon as my wife took her first bite, she said, mmmmm, this is a really good hot dog. Both of ours were really nice grilled, I prefer them on the over cooked, rather than undercooked side. 

Waffle fries were good, I still tend to prefer regular fries, but these were fine. 

They have a really nice condiment bar that you can select all kinds of toppings, I didn't add anything to my chili cheese dog, nor did my wife. Looked like most of the stuff would be most suitable to add to a burger. But it all looked very fresh!!

The owner told us about the dogs, he has a meat packer make them specifically for him, very little in the way of any kind of preservatives and very low in sodium.  And all fresh ground sirloin I belive. 

We will definitely return when the hot dog craving strikes, glad to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Solid burger and good service. Fries were ok

The menu is full with many options. Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Looking for healthy burgers and dogs? This is a great place to look. Healthy includes no nitrates or nitrites, no processed white flour, and fresh local produce. Taste is good and staff really enthusiastic. The ambience is storefront , but since we are talking a mall location, that's fine. Can't evaluate the fries since i don't eat them, but the sounded great. Prices include fixings bar, which makes this a decent buy. We will return."}
{"text":"Loved this place before the new owner took over. They had a great hotdog menu that told you what was on each hotdog, now that's gone, very disappointed. They always had a great military discount that the new owner no longer has and the food isn't as good. The kids were pretty disappointed as well. My Chicago dog was nothing special like it use to be. Waffle fries are gone. I imagine they will lose a lot of the regular old regulars. We live just down the road and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I had the Chili cheese dog and garlic fries.   Lots of food and really great taste!   Atmosphere is perfect for hot dogs & burgers.   I'll have the wine marinated burger next time.   Oh, did I mention the staff?   This is a family owned spot with family at the counter.  Friendly, helpful and truly appreciative of their patrons.   I like that!"}
{"text":"I first noticed them a couple of months ago when we were going the movie theatre next door, but ignored them because typically, there's nothing in a Burger & Hot Dog joint for a vegan. But after checking their website and the Yelp reviews, I discovered that they have veggie options, so I decided to give them a try.  (My review is based solely on the veggie options.)


VEGAN BURGER:
It's actually one of the first things I saw when entering this establishment.  They proudly featured \"Vegan Burgers\" on their display board.  The owner explained that the burger patty is homemade and gluten-free.  They also offer gluten-free buns (which I did not try). 

The burger was fresh and tasty.  I'm not great in the kitchen, so unlike some, I can't pinpoint specific ingredients, but I think I saw rice and grains... maybe some quinoa? Totally guessing. But it's a great, healthy, soy-free and vegan option, which you get to decorate with a variety of options from their toppings bar. 


HOT DOGS:
They do not offer a vegan hot dog at this time, but they do have a soy-based vegetarian hot dog.  When I initially asked about the hot dog the woman was honest, yet evasive, about why it wasn't vegan. I asked if it contains dairy, to which she replied yes, but the vagueness was killing me.  I'm a local ambassador for a vegan website, so I needed a little more information.   1/2 way through my veggie burger I asked her again.  She brought over the packaging so that I could see the ingredients.  Allergens were soy, wheat, and eggs (no dairy).  I think she was trying to keep the brand a secret. I don't care about that; I only care about the ingredients.  I was grateful that she gave me the courtesy of showing me the ingredients on the package, which immediately gave me peace of mind. I didn't want to share mis-information. 


FRENCH FRIES:
1st - The way Bubba, from Forest Gump, was a shrimp aficionado, is how I am with potatoes.  So when I glazed upon their various options, though not extensive, I was still joyous.  And they allow you to split the flavors.  So if you'd like to try the Cajun fries and the Garlic, you can do 1/2 and 1/2. Sweet! This is exactly what I did.   

The Cajun seasoning definitely had some kick, but wasn't too spicy.  The Garlic seasoning was very flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  The waffle fries were fresh and crisp.  Honestly, I could come here just for the fries and be completely satisfied. 


The prices are completely reasonable, in my opinion. 

I watched the owner as she greeted familiar faces when they ordered, and later walked around to each table asking how the food was for everyone.  She obviously enjoys and takes pride in her business, which is a lovely thing to witness.

I will continue to support this small business.  I do, however, hope that a vegan hot dog option is offered in the future. There are so many awesome vegan hot dog options right across the street at Whole Foods.  Pick up a pack, grill it, bun it, and sell it. Save me the trouble of cooking or grilling; I'll buy it!"}
{"text":"took the grandkids there for lunch w/ a groupon since we had several errands to do in the area.  younger boy said the burger was one of the best he's eaten.  He's 8-1/2.  The 9-1/2 year old, who is quite picky ate his 1/4 lb hot dog down as well as his fries and some of his brother's!  My husband had the 2 hot dog lunch special and added the combo.  He was impressed w/ the condiment bar-which included some pretty nice looking cole slaw w/ raisins.

I usually stick w/ raw veggies and hummus for lunch, so I just had some iced tea.  But if we had been closer to the dinner hour-the vegan burger w/ quinoa, brown rice and sweet potatoes sounded right up my alley!"}
{"text":"$13 for hot dog, fries, drink. For a moment I wondered if I was inside the movie theater and paying their prices for food.  They didn't have a combo either - the dollars just add up fast.  Only one size of soda pop too, and it's $2.50.  The food was a little better than most fast food places, but this food isn't fast, and it isn't *that* much better.  If a basic, order at the counter lunch is going to run me $13 I have a long list of places I'd rather go."}
{"text":"The restaurant has great ideas and theme and also a tribute to Wallace and Ladmo for the old Phoenicians.

Their theme is a nostalgic cafe sort of look

Lucky s offers a Burger/Hot Dog bar to add toppings for what you prefer

Shared the 1/4 Pound Wine Burger, Sonoran Polish Dog and Deep Fried Mushrooms.

The Wine Burger has a very good taste. The beef patty is on the small size and I added bacon. The bun seems like a normal bun you would buy at a grocery store. It could do much better with a pretzel bun. 

The Sonoran Bacon Wrapped Polish Dog is very good but again the bun is nothing to write home about. If they put the bacon wrapped polish dog either in a pita like Short Leash Dogs or a Mexican Sonoran Dog Bun it would be amazing.

The deep fried mushrooms were very good and one of the better prepared mushrooms I have had in a while.

The people are very friendly and interested in listening to your feedback.

The owner said they use to be located at the Scottsdale Promenade and moved to the current location less than 2 months ago.

With a few changes mainly to the bread they can be a memorable place to eat rather than a quick bite before the movies.

Will try again and be back."}
{"text":"Really very good hot dog and waffle fries.  Only down fall is very hot in restaurant.  Food is great but need to do something about temperature in restaurant. Been to many restaurants in Scottsdale in summer, never experienced bad temp in restaurant .  So may try again in winter. So can't recommend this place to anyone for dine in."}
{"text":"A Groupon that was about to expire brought me here. I had just gone to the Harkins theater next door and thought I would check this place out.  It is a small place, but clean and well decorated. It has old gas station signs and the like as decor. The two guys working there were very friendly and helpful. Not knowing what to have, I decided to blow the Groupon on several things. Ended up getting a Chili Cheese Dog, Chicago Dog, Sonoran Dog and onion rings.  So the dogs. Let me first say that all of them were very tasty. I don't know what kind of dogs they use, but they were very good.  First the Chicago dog.... Not like other Chicago dogs that I have had. They don't put celery salt, sport peppers or a dill pickle on their version. When I asked about that, the gentleman told me that they have that stuff but most people don't like them that way...outside of Chicago. So, if you are like me and you do like them that way, be sure to ask.  Second up was the Sonoran dog. For those not familiar with these, it is a bacon wrapped dog with pinto bean, onions, salsa and a mayo type sauce. It was pretty good. The ones I have had in Tucson were a little bit better in that the bacon was crispier and the buns a little sweeter. But this was a pretty good substitute. Last up was the chili cheese dog. This, like the others was quite good. I would have liked the chili to have been spicier... I like spicy food... See the sport pepper comment at the beginning. As for cheese on the chili cheese dog, they use a cheese sauce. I would have liked grated cheddar and maybe some raw onions on top instead. Bet they have those things as well and that you just need to ask. Finally the onion rings. They were very good as well. The didn't taste greasy...which can happen a lot with o-rings... And they were cooked just right.  I will be back to Lucky's when I am nearby. I didn't mention it, but Lucky's also sells discounted movie tickets to Harkins! Sooooo take advantage of that the next time you want to see a movie and get a bite before.
