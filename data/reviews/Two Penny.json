{"text":"Speaking as a Chinese person, the food was okay. A couple of the dishes were very agreeable such as the cold chicken or the special fried rice, but outside of that, the other dishes that we had ordered were just serviceable. The char siu was way too dry, and the beef ho fan was soupy for some strange reason. My biggest gripe was with how loud the music was, which caused my ears to ring hours after I had left. The morning after, I ended up with temporary hearing loss in one of my ears which resulted in a very annoying four days. I felt like I just came back from a concert. Is it really necessary to have your music on that loud? This is a restaurant, not a night club."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! We had an assortment of appts and main courses and loved them all, fave was the wagu beef and broccoli! All the dishes were flavourful with quick service. The atmosphere is fun and all service from the time we walked in was great! It is not your typical Chinese restaurant and that's what makes it great, twist on many dishes for the better:))"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin about how much I love the food at Two Penny. For starters, their Instagram posts are on point. Their drool inducing photos are what lured us in, and the food itself is what is going to keep us coming back!

We went big with our first experience:
- Chongqing chicken wings (spicy!!)
- Pork cheek spring rolls
- Shrimp wontons
- Roast half duck with milk buns
- Wok fried bok choy
- Special fried rice with bone marrow

Nothing was short of amazing. Seriously, I loved it all. The wings are numbingly spicy and the rich bone marrow adds another level of favour to the rice. And you can't go wrong with the roast duck which falls in line with the traditional peking duck dish you have at other Chinese restaurants. 

They always have weekly specials, and of course, their Tea House features Dim Sum Sundays which is something we'll have to add to our dining rotation!"}
{"text":"I must preface this by saying we only visited the Teahouse, which is in the basement of the main Two Penny dining room. 

Honestly, we kind of stumbled here as we wanted a place to hangout before we went to a show at Habitat just next door. Upon entering the basement, the Teahouse was pretty much exactly what I expected - dark and dingy, a place you go to not for the aesthetics, but the offerings. The wall across the entryway has an awesome wallpaper featuring overlapping tigers on a sea of blue. I've never been to the region, but the ambiance was on point for what I expected.

We decided to sample some of the cocktails. The menu is short, but provides fairly good variety. I decided to get the Mandy Derby (bourbon, mandarine, honey, lemon), which is basically your typical citrusy bourbon drink, although you can taste the quality ingredients. Later on I decided to try the Virgin Kaine (tennesse whiskey, toasted oats, honey, apple bitters), which honestly I'm not sure how to describe, but it was incredibly delicious. Had to be careful with this one as you can definitely put it back a bit too fast with how good it was.

The teahouse also has a dim sum cart that goes around. The chef talked up their dumplings, so we passed on all of the other items in order to wait for them as they had sold out of them. For some reason though he eventually told us they would not be making anymore dumplings for the evening, so we didn't end up trying anything from the cart.

Overall, the teahouse is a cool place to hang out and grab good drinks with some interesting foods. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"This review is for the Tea House downstairs.

What we loved:
The music - they played hip hop the night we dined there
The staff and service. Exceptional. The bartender made sure we were constantly taken care of. 
The vibe. Absolutely loved how moody the Tea House is.
Soup dumplings, fried pork buns, fried custard.
Presentation of food.

What could have been improved:
We were crazy hungry and tried almost everything on the Dim Sum menu. Sadly we weren't blown away. The spices and flavour in these Chinese dishes were definitely lacking. It is quite a bit more expensive than your typical Chinatown dim sum joint with smaller portions.
Wish the Tea House actually served tea. That would have been a nice touch.

Would definitely come back if we hear that their dishes have improved."}
{"text":"This place may be a hit or miss for some, but this one is a big hit on me; despite the price to food portion ratio. All of the food menu items I ordered were just right for me, but it may be too salty for some. I highly recommend their Mapo Tofu & Char Siu Pork (lots of meat inside). 

The atmosphere and decorations were definitely my type, modernized tradition while maintaining key elements to remind you of China. I would go back again to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Really nice interior, good cocktails, but the food was really nothing special - especially for the price. We had some dumpling varieties (pretty good), Brussels sprouts (just ok), and the chicken (my least favourite). I would probably come by again for a cocktail at the tea house, but would grab food elsewhere first."}
{"text":"Dumplings and all Chinese tapas were excellent.  We also had the schezuan noodles which I found far too spicey and salty- as well as the beef and broccoli.  This was good but I wish I had just had more of the small plates instead.  Shrimp dumplings were the best I've had.  Service was not great as the server told us the noodles were not spicey at all (they were too spicey so we ate less than half) and she must have asked us 50 times if we needed anything- interrupting our conversation constantly.  I'd definitely go back- but would skip the larger dishes."}
{"text":"The decor and hipster vibe in the space is great if that is what you are after. Staff was surly and unaccommodating. We had 4 people with a 5th on the way, we asked to be seated at one of the round tables that wasn't by the door because we had another person coming and we were cold but they said no because they wanted to save those tables in case more people came in even though no one ever did. Our server wouldn't crack a smile and when we asked about what the drinks were like he acted like it was a huge pain / didn't give us accurate information.  

I loved the scallion pancake roll (a favorite of mine, especially at Peaceful Restaurant in Vancouver). Our Xiao Long Bao had been sitting in the back for a while so the bottom was hard and stuck to the paper when you tried to pick them up which caused us to \"loose\" the soup inside of the dumpling (best part!) we mentioned it to our server who reluctantly brought us new ones after a friend was quite firm with him. The steam buns were standard and the Dan Dan noodles lacked flavor, I ended up putting some of the dumpling vinegar on them to give them some taste. 

On another occasion we went down to the Tea House and same thing, service was so bad. First of all they told us they don't serve tea there which seems weird, our server brought us menus and never told us about the cart that comes around. Our server was a total space cadet, we specifically asked her if there was anything that wasn't on the menu or any specials. 

We eventually got some cart items, I didn't think any of them tasted good sadly. One item must have had Szechuan peppercorn in it because my friends were freaking out about their mouths being numb, I think the servers should warn customers when the kitchen uses this spice because non-Chinese people aren't used to that feeling. I think Calgarians like to try new things so I wouldn't eliminate it all together, but personally I wouldn't order something with that spice in it.  . 

Both upstairs and downstairs I didn't love any of the cocktails, I think the flavors either didn't mesh or they were boring. My friend did have a good whisky drink but the other cocktails were underwhelming. 

I would say go here if you want a hip vibe, but if you want cocktails Native Tongues, Proof and Hotel Arts are all better in this area. If you want good Chinese go to Good Taste or Szechuan Restaurant - I hope the owners/chefs visit these two spots and Peaceful in Vancouver and up the flavor a bit! Good luck Two Penny, I hope you grow to be amazing."}
{"text":"Finally a good Chinese food place in Calgary with great wine. It's nice that they have some of the lowest markups on wine in the city as well."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food in Calgary. This place fills up, so go early. Another great place for a date. Also, check out the tea room downstairs. Good cocktails and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"As a relatively new establishment in Calgary, my friends and I were very excited to try this modern Chinese restaurant. The first thing we all noticed was how difficult it was to hear each other. Be prepared to shout a bit as the ambience can be quite loud when it gets busy. The service was also VERY slow and we had a couple dishes that were forgotten. It should be noted that the shift supervisor was very apologetic and did comp a few items off of our bill, which was very kind. (Pictured) Beef and broccoli was a hit with tender wagyu brisket. Wok fried vegetables were cooked deliciously al dente. Fried chicken fried rice was a clever take on an otherwise basic dish. Love the lazy susan in the middle of the table... makes for easy sharing. Looking forward to trying cocktails at the Tea House, located downstairs from Two Penny... but I don't know if I'd return to eat here."}
{"text":"Only had appetizers but will go back for more. Flavours were brilliant in the small plates. Had shrimp toast, which sounds odd but worked beautifully with crumbly toast infused with flavour soaked in from a generous shrimp and cheese topping. The wagyu beef spring rolls were fantastic, wrapped in fresh lettuce leaf. Love it when you can actually taste the ingredients!"}
{"text":"It is a beautiful space with a good cocktail and drink list. 

Service was great, drinks were well-balanced, food was a different story. 

If you are expecting really delicious upscale versions of your Chinatown favourites, it is not what you are going to get.

All the flavors felt muted or missing the balance i normally expect from this kind of meal.
I'm fine with paying a bit more for reimagined or really perfected dishes but nothing was a standout or worth the increased price of dining here.
I had the beef roll, shirmp dumplings, szechuan chicken (this was actually legit), special fried rice and a few other things. 

Nothing was amazing. Needed more balance and spice! Where's the ginger?!??"}
{"text":"Yum! Stopped in with two friends for the Chinese New Year dinner set menu for $45.00. The decor is on point, very trendy as you can see from their Instagram. We all got cocktails to start, they're a bit pricey for a size in my opinion but were pretty tasty, afterward, we switched to wine which is a better value for what you're getting. Our server(s) were very friendly and knowledgeable. We had one main server who brought us drinks and checked in regularly but different servers brought out the food dishes throughout the menu, I appreciated that they gave an overview of the dish and added extras like \"stick all your chopsticks in and stir for good luck\". All the dishes were presented beautifully and were quite tasty, we weren't a huge fan of the lingcod soup course but that is more of a personal preference. At the end of the meal we were happy and stuffed!"}
{"text":"It's about time a modern and happening Asian inspired restaurant opens up in Calgary....however, Two Penny has a ways to go when it comes to the food it is serving. We had the pork buns (average -- nothing special compared to good dim sum restaurants), the lobster/shrimp dumplings (pretty darned good), the seven spice seafood (again, average and nothing different than what you could get at a good Chinese joint, as well as a really awful sczechwan noodles (tastes like udon noodles were slathered in peanut butter, lime juice and soya sauce. Gross!). 

Someone I spoke to referred to the place as \"fake Chinese\". I would concur! There hasn't been much effort to modernize or give traditional Chinese food dishes a lift, to match the very cool space. So if you're looking for a pretty place with average food, at a high price tag, this might be a good stop. If you're looking for great and innovative Asian food, I'd seriously take a pass!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have wanted to try Two Penny since it opened and had heard all the hype surrounding it leading up to that point. However, it was incredibly underwhelming to the say the least. I'll go over a couple of points, both good and bad, in order to convey why we've decided it only deserves a 2.5.

- The ambience was fantastic. It's so well decorated and the staff was friendly. The music was great too.
*this is likely the only good point*

- The seafood dumplings in the photo were so salty, I couldn't enjoy anything else after trying them. We've also got pork dumplings, which weren't bad, but not evenly cooked (still chewy dough in places), special fried rice that was also very salty and greasy, and their signature ginger beef (ribs) that was just nothing to write home about. We packed half of our meal to go - it was simply not enjoyable enough to finish.

- We will gladly pay more for quality, but $170 for two ($150+tips) for pretty basic Chinese food is an absolute robbery.

The first impression was simply ruined by the food. I wanted to recommend the place to my friends, based on the ambience, but quickly changed my mind after trying the dishes."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!! Such a fun spot - the special fried rice with the bone marrow was the favourite of the evening but the crispy mushroom dumplings are also a delight! The crispy pork belly comes with the most amazing smoked and pickled apple slices and the drinks are always super fun! We came on a Saturday so you know it's going to be packed and had a friend join us 1/2 way through. The staff were great in getting us accommodated with the extra person. After we went downstairs to the tea house the keep the fun going, the bartenders downstairs are SO NICE, our server however was not friendly or attentive, luckily the rest of the tea house staff made up for it."}
{"text":"Had take out - half duck with tea, chicken wings and the drunken fish. Nicely balanced and enjoyable"}
{"text":"My partner is on a restricted diet for the next few days (low residue) and wanted wings, and it fell on us to try Two Penny at last as there are plenty of presumably fibre-free items (rice and protein, basically) and so we had lunch here yesterday. We were, surprisingly, the only customers in a BIG space for the entirety of our meal and so we got to know the place well. The first impression is how cool this space is- it reminds me of an Old Town resto in Portland that's been updated but that retains its funky charm. The overall effect isn't a bit kitschy; it's really very beautiful. 

Now to the food: we ordered 6 items: the steamed shrimp and lobster dumplings, the deep-fried mushroom dumplings, the cucumbers, the smoked pickled egg, the lamb cumin bao, the chicken wings of course, and amaranth tea. The egg was fantastic and at $2 not bad value at all. The dumplings were both winners; the shrimp and lobster could go toe-to-toe with any dim sum in town and the absolute highlight of the meal was the mushroom ones. The filling is studded with black truffle (or a very convincing black mushroom), it's fried beautifully and comes with what I can only describe as tartar sauce on the side. It is fantastic. 

So-so were the lamb bao: a bit gamey tasting and I've had much better bao elsewhere. 

Misses were the cukes and the wings, which was after all what we came for. The cukes were dressed far too  lightly and tasted of nothing and cost an in my opinion unreasonable $7 for a meagre portion that wasn't very good at all. Worst were the wings: they are deep-fried and then coated with this jarring spice mixture that is bizarrely sweet and unbelievably spicy at the same. The dust gets all over your fingers and we just found the entire experience trying to eat them difficult. $14 for this. The tea was fantastic. We left full and I wouldn't say the total of $60 before tip was terrible considering the beauty of the space and the uniqueness of the food, but I know that I could have gone to Han's or Great Taste a mere few blocks away in Chinatown and left much happier with the food, and we'd have spent less than half of what we spent at Two Penny. All that said, I''ll probably return, but they have to work on those wings. They are terrible."}
{"text":"This is a review for the Teahouse only. Going to give it a 4 to be nice but its more of a 3.5.

I came there to try the Slurpee 101. It said Rose, Gin, Lemon and Lychee... I'm not reaaaaallly sure what I was expecting. Maybe more lychee? What it is is a smallish cup with what I assume is lemon slush that they add Rose and Gin to, didn't see any Lychee. I guess it had 2oz of liquor in it though! I would give that drink a 2/5. The price is good at $13 per 2oz. 

Otherwise I think the place had a good vibe. I enjoyed the decor and I really liked the the hipster teahouse vibe. 5/5

Service was kind of slow. Not the worst ever but there weren't many people at the time. Took us a good 10 minutes sitting at the bar before we got service. Again, not the worst, and once we got service our drinks came quickly.

I would give this place another try and maybe a re-review at some point. I liked the crowd and met some cool people there!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Two Penny Chinese after seeing some delicious looking dishes posted on Instagram. We ordered the Braised Beef Shin, Scallion Pancake Roll, Crispy Mushroom Dumplings, Cumin Lamb Ribs, and Special Fried Rice. The Special Fried Rice with bone marrow mixed in was easily the best selection of the night and something I would have again. The Crispy Mushroom Dumplings and Scallion Pancake Roll were pretty good but not spectacular. The Cumin Lamb Ribs were not good at all and we both agreed it was the worst dish we had that night. All in all it was a pretty average experience. I'd like to go back and try some other things on the menu because it does have potential. If I could I'd give this place 3.5 stars but from the experience we had it's  definitely not deserving of 4 so I rounded down."}
{"text":"Delicious, fun take on Chinese food! I loved the perfectly seasoned vegetables and the mushroom dumplings especially were delicious. Great service and ambiance, no pressure to rush us out despite being quite busy on a Tuesday! Would go again for the well-imagined Chinese and creative desserts :)"}
{"text":"Herd lots about this restaurant.  We tried it out and it was just ok.  

Had a few items.   Was told the Beef was to die for.  We found it chewy, and very salty.   The other dishes we tried had similar salt content.   We left them on the table.   

The mixed drinks and martini's were well done.  

The bill was $200, Plus tip and tax.   That was for 2 martini's, 2 glasses of wine, 2 high balls, and a few items off the menu.  

They worst part of the night was they wanted our table for the next seating.   Since when did Calgary start this ridiculous idea.  We had a great conversation at the table and would have ordered a few more drinks, but the server stood over us and basically wanted us gone !   Oh well, we went next door."}
{"text":"Their Instagram drew me here, their presentations didn't dissapoint. 

I was really excited to try this place, unfortunately I feeling kind if Meh. The service was great with knowledgeable staff who were happy to explain in detail their menu. Once the food arrive my friend and I just kept thinking it was good. Alas, for the price, it should be great.  They do have a nice selection of cocktails and other spirits. 

I am glad I went but I won't make it a regular stop until the food wows."}
