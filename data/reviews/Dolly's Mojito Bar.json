{"text":"Loved this place! Has a cool contemporary dive feel to it. I didn't know what to expect in regards to Filipino food but I was not let down. Three of us shared 5 dishes and everything was super tasty and of great quality. The Kinilaw and Kawali Salad were my faves. We also had two pitchers of mojitos. If the prices were expensive previously, they did a wise job reevaluating. The mojito pitchers aren't cheap but the quality of ingredients were there so I didn't mind! Would for sure go back."}
{"text":"Delicious, inventive takes on classic Filipino dishes. Staff is knowledgable and the cocktails are amazing! Try the goat adobo and the Filipino mojito. 

Also the other comments about pricing are unfair. I ate here with my partner and we shared three mains, each had a boozy mojito, and left very full. Our bill came to $65. This is standard for this city, guys! Also the quality is exceptional and the atmosphere is great. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails and great food. I was so sad when the last restaurant in this spot, Whippoorwill, closed its doors, but this place is a more than worthy successor. I had the Filipino fried rice and the makapuno cake, and it was all to die for. The service was good too - you can tell they're still getting the hang of things, but they're super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"While walking by at dinner time, I stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant after noticing their Thursday buck a shuck oyster night. 
It's a small place with most welcoming d√©core. The staff were also welcoming, and kind. I sat at the bar and distracted the bartender, who carefully creating great looking mohitos, with my chatter. (I tend to do that:) )
I had to eat light, so I ordered 9 oysters and a fish taco and was not disappointed. The oysters were deliciously briny and well presented and the fish taco was piled hi with fish, guacamole, onions and lots of other tasty ingredients. I was seriously delighted with what I ordered and will go back! Props to the good people at Dolly's!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and loved it both times. First time was my bday and the service and food were phrnomonal. Best calamari and chicken adobo I've ever had. (Both were just as good the second time).
We had a few modifications to menu items and everyone was super accomodating. The bartender made my dad a specific cocktail that was not on the menu and made my father in law a meal that wasn't on the menu due to his being very picky when it comes to food. Overall I was very impressed and have told anyone who is willing to listen!"}
{"text":"I had a party of 21 people for my birthday here and the staff was very accommodating to us. They let us have the whole back section with no seating time. The food and drinks were delicious, the staff was great but my favourite part of this place is the atmosphere. It's like an old diner with a modern flare. It was an amazing experience and I would definitely recommend trying this place out and 100% will come back."}
{"text":"4 stars  out of 5 for:

(my first time at this joint, & wanted to celebrate a cousin's bday & support a local business)

- the burger w tocino was tasty & aight - could have used more of that red, sweet/smoky & slightly tangy sauce; also, a small chunk of the burger meat was chewy (really chewy - i.e., meat quality not there); for a $13 burger, this dish could have used a pairing - like a mango & carrot achara or a small salad?
- the calamansi iced drink I ordered was also tasty but could have used more juice as my taste is more on the tangy side.
- my mates who were with me enjoyed their meal; they really like the spam fries coated in chicharron
- note: my tasting of their menu is limited bec of my food allergies (e.g., they fry in the same oil their fries & seafood)"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic other than it being so ridiculously dark! We ordered the calamansi punch which was a refreshing take on the standard sour drink itself. Then the lumpia, kare kare nachos, adobo nacho and I forget the other one but they were all tasty. Next came the deep fried dessert which was just the cherry on top. I was kind of sad it only came with 3 cubes. Would've definitely killed that if we ordered more. And the music was pretty amazing as well on this particular night. I tried to shazam a few songs but alas, their taste too indie for the mainstream system."}
{"text":"Where to begin?  To be honest, the food was okay.  Yes small portions for the $, but if the portions were bigger, I might still be there waiting for my plate. Started with the Spam fries.  They were okay.  Just enough for me and 2 friends to say we tried them.  Kinda like a hot dog coated in a crispy batter and fried.  I had the canton noodle.  Not sure what pickled peas are... But I could not find anything that resembled a pea. Wasn't a huge portion, so I may have missed the pea. It was okay but such a small portion.  The worst... My friends fried chicken arrived.  I swear to God 15 minutes later my other friends ox tail arrived and 2 minutes later my canton noodle.  It was weird 15 minutes watching my.friends food get cold while we waited for the other 2 orders.  Food was good. Table with 2 out of control toddlers was a drag.  They left thank God.  Been there... Won't go back. The mojito I had.... Could drink lots of them. But at 12 bucks a pop, I will create my own."}
{"text":"The Pancit Pusit (squid ink pasta with baby octopi and sweet sausages) and Mojado mojito were a hit and are definitely worth trying. I wasn't a fan of the Filipino Mojito, couldn't really taste the pineapple juice. The sugarcane stick garnish in the drinks are a nice touch. Not many vegetarian friendly options and the one dish my friend ordered was a smallish bun for $9. Serving staff were definitely friendly and a nice vibe overall."}
{"text":"I would say this restaurant is up there with Lamesa in terms of quality. The food is Filipino fusion and everything we ordered was on point. It's definitely on  the pricier side, but if you just look at the quality, presentation, and taste together, I don't think it is steep at all.

Let's talk dishes:

We ordered the shrimp kinilaw, which I guess you could say is like the Filipino \"tartare\"/ ceviche. It's essentially a raw dish where the shrimp/fish is semi cooked in lime. It was pretty darn good. It came with coconut cream and some chips to slather the kinilaw on.  

We had three tacos. So you can mix and match. but if you order 3 of the same you get a slightly cheaper deal. I highly recommend the goat adobo. That was a favorite. I don't know what the heck was in that sauce. but it was so rich, ,bold, and powerfully tasty. We also ordered the sisig taco and the last one I can't remember. so it was probably the least memorable, as you can tell.

The last dish was an oxtail miki pancit, Pancit is just a general term for \"noodle\" and this dish was so carby, so heavy, but oh so wonderful. I loved the oxtail meat, it was so tender and soft. The noodles are handmade at the restaurant I hear and yes, they were equally as magical as the rest of the dish. They have other pancit dishes you can try. but this one we chose because it seemed different and odd. My boyfriend told me he wouldn't be able to finish it because it was so rich and heavy. I told him that I could totally eat the whole thing..alone. Yes. I am that indulgent of a person.

I would keep in mind that this restaurant is definitely more tapas style, so the dishes are relatively small. Prepare to share, prepare to be awed too. I love this place. Would come again if ever had another chance. I can't say much for drinks because I was in it for the food, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Love the details of the place! Some great food to choose from. I hadn't had much Pilipino food before, so I just ordered a bunch of random things... my fav was this noodle dish (no idea what the name was)! Honestly, go try something random on their menu. The cocktails were also super fun and large!"}
{"text":"My friend and I are Filipino and could not get over the menu prices. $10 for 5 lumpias?? You could probably get 30 for $10 at Jesse Jr or any other family-owned Filipino restaurant! The thought of that deterred us from ordering food. My friend had the Cuban mojito and I had the Filipino one (we actually switched and took each other's orders because I didn't like mine.) Cuban was not good, the taste of the alcohol was very strong. Filipino was a bit better, bit sweeter, but I still wasn't into it. The ambience of the place I have to say was amazing though. Love the neon Dolly's sign, the low-lighting, and the art. It was weird not seeing any Filipino bartenders or waiters. I guess Filipino food is really trending in the city currently"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and the atmosphere was electric. The staff are all really friendly and approachable, they love sharing what's good on the menu. The fried adobo chicken was delicious, and the mushroom guisado was full of flavor. The tacos were good but a bit pricey for the portion. All in all great place to just hang out and have a good time and food."}
{"text":"The prices have gone down substantially since last time I went here but the food is still fantastic. We had the goat adobo, the sour wings, the sizzling pork and the shrimp and chicken pancit. All were delicious (especially the goat--highly recommend!). The mojitos were refreshing and cheap with some nice variety. I'd recommend the tequila mojito if you prefer them less sweet. The service is wonderful and the place is warm and fun!"}
{"text":"Well hello Dolly, you funky rum resto-bar, you...we loved your decor, your red booths, your music and your rum cocktails, particularly the Mestizo mojito and the Pinoy Colada. 

All drinks here are made with fresh ingredients and the mojito even came with a stalk of sugarcane. Yum!

We also ordered pork spring rolls, which were mighty tasty. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Excellent value, delicious food, yummy mojitos  and friendly staff! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for take-out surprised at the pricepoint and for the amount of food given. 20$ for palabok? You could go to sherbourne and have a filipino kamayan feast for $14.99 Maybe they should evaluate the prices."}
{"text":"Really love the ambience, style, and music, but was really disappointed with the food and price. It's extremely overpriced and the food was average at best. We had the Filipino fried rice, and a noodle dish, as well as a mojito. Perhaps the snacks are a better choice?"}
{"text":"Try the fried rice, very tasty but food was too pricey for what it was. Halo halo was bad, it was freezer burned and didn't have all the ingredients. Filipino Mojito was good, they sell them in pitcher form too. Generous portions with the Kare Kare."}
{"text":"One of my friends brought me here for their mojitos and I have to say it was AMAZING! The neighbourhood is not the greatest but it adds character to the place in my opinion. We ordered the coconut mojito and i was blown away. They even added a sugarcane on the side. The combinations of flavours worked very well together. The bartender was very attentive and friendly which I always enjoy. The decor inside was very retro and music created a very hip ambience. I will definitely be coming back! Free parking is a bit difficult in this area but you can park in Landsdowne Station which is a two minute walk."}
{"text":"Truly incredible. Amazing tacos, cool vibe, great service, excellent drinks. Surprisingly, the cauliflower taco was our favourite."}
{"text":"This place made food that I'm not to fond of , AMAZING! Mojito 
Service was more than accommodating and hospitable ...."}
{"text":"Wandered onto this lovely little restaurant one evening and what a treat it was! Located on Bloor just west of Dufferin in the up and coming neighbourhood of Bloordale, Dolly's is a beautifully decorated diner style esque restaurant. The ambiance alone is worth the visit. 

Food is a modern take on Pilipino food. Everything was on the saltier side. Pancit Pusit was an amazing dish, slightly on the oily side. 

Al drinks made with freshly pressed cane juice as sweetener. 

Restaurant created by the same creator as playa cabana. 

Truly Toronto based restaurant. Great vibes and reason to explore this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I dig mojitos, so this place seemed like a must. We had just finished a meal at the most excellent Wallflower and Dolly's was pretty close, so in we walked on a Friday evening.

We were able to get a table right away even though we didn't have a reservation, which was great but we were next to the door so we had a perfect view of people with reservations being told to sit at the bar because there were no tables. It was weird (and a little awkward).

Anyway, this being a joint with the word \"mojito\" in its name, I obviously had to order a mojito. I decided to go with the Filipino (\"Flor de Cana 5 year, fresh pineapple juice, cane juice, calamansi lime, mint.\") 

It's not great, honestly. I mean, it's fine. It's a mojito, it gets the job done, but I just expected so much more. The flavors are so muted as to be non-existent. At a price point in the mid-teens, I was expecting to be blown away and honestly I've consumed tastier drinks at Pickle Barrel.

We decided to also share an appetizer: Calamari Fried Pusit (\"Tapioca/corn starch battered squid, calamansi lime, cane vinegar/red chile aioli.\") The portion is plentiful and the dish arrived hot, but again, there's a lack of flavor here that sinks it. The calamari is cooked well, admittedly, but the batter is bland to the point of frustration. And so is the aioli, surprisingly enough. Usually if a fried item isn't great, there's a tasty dip to rescue it and that just wasn't the case here.

I should also note that service was painfully slow. I suppose it's not entirely their fault, since for some bizarre reason, the guy doing the drinks was also our waiter and he was super busy all night.

Finally, and I know this'll sound weird, but the joint is way, way too bright for a nighttime establishment. With all the garish lights and displays, it was like trying to enjoy a drink on a busy amusement-park midway. It was distracting and annoying."}
{"text":"This place is really incredible. We had been searching online for a place to eat last Saturday and came across Dolly's, and we are so very glad we did! Neither of us had tried traditional Philippino food before and our server was very helpful. After explaining the menu, he also gave us suggestions on things to try and what a reasonable amount of each serving would be! As someone who always orders too much, I appreciate it!

We both had different mojitos to start, both equally delicious. So much so that I ordered a pitcher after that! We had the nachos (still having dreams about them) and assorted lettuce wrap tacos. The food was absolutely unreal. The Sizzler was AMAZING! So salty and so rich from the egg on top, but well balanced with the fresh lettuce wraps it's served with!

Dolly's was absolutely fantastic and we can't wait to go back!!! Thanks for the wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Went here last week and love their mojitos,came back today its a Tuesday 5pm March 20 ,2018. locked doors. website says they open at 5pm on Tuesdays. went to another bar for a quick drink. back at 6pm. Still locked. kinda cold to keep me stranded outside. they need to update their website and yelp page to say they are closed on Tuesdays as other people may try to come here that day."}
{"text":"The Filipino mojito was amazing. The sugarcane and pineapple garnish was a nice touch. One of the managers was really cute, he let me charge my phone. I love the music and ambience. Definitely coming back"}
