{"text":"Love this place. Went there on Monday night and had a blast. Food's great and they always have new seasonal beers to keep things fresh - I love the daily food specials also.   The best reverse happy hour in North Scottsdale and three friendliest bar staff to boot."}
{"text":"Average bar food. The pork poutine was really good. The rest of the food we ordered, 2 salads and a club sandwich were all just average."}
{"text":"Just got into town and was drinking the Knot Hop at the Postino Wine Bar and my boyfriend I decided me need to find this brewery in Phoenix.  From where we were staying it a little bit down the rail line but once we got there it was worth it!  Great Brew!  We didn't eat there but I can't imagine the food being bad if the beer was great!"}
{"text":"Four Peaks is great.  The beer is awesome and the food is very good.  Probably the best nachos, ruben, and burger in the valley (in my opinion).   The atmosphere at the original Four Peaks in Tempe is better, but the Scottsdale location is very convenient if you live in the north part of town.  My only complaint is how busy this place seems to have become in the last couple years.  I used to be able to stop in after work or on the weekends/ meet a friend for a beer and find a seat no-problem.  But lately it seems to always be packed.  No seats at the bar or the high-top tables.   And half the people at the bar are not even drinking real beer, they are drinking swill like bud-light.  They shouldn't even sell that crap.  Anyways, won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Four Peaks has great beer!  Ky was a great server!  We had a fun night there! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The beer and the food is amazing and reasonably priced. The service is rather lackluster. It's just not quite the same as the Tempe location. If you have the choice, I would definitely recommend checking out the Tempe location instead."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots.  Four Peaks consistently delivers superior food and drink with outstanding service.  Love all the handcrafted beers, which is to be expected from a brewpub.  But two things really distinguish Four Peaks -  food and service.  The food is inventive, tasty, and consistently excellent.  Also love the daily food specials.    The people are incredibly friendly, helpful, and service is stellar.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times for business lunches and had never been disappointed with food or service until tonight.  Food 2/5  We had the thai hummus and southwest burger. The hummus is actually very nice. Has a nice kick to it and you take taste the peanut sauce but its not overwhelming. The pita however was very soggy and felt like it came straight out of a microwave. The southwest burger was good, nothing more and nothing less. I did expect more 'southwest flavor' though.  Service 1/5  About 2 minutes after our appetizer was brought out the server brought our entree's  'Sorry, your server put in two different tickets' was his reaction when he noticed that we had just begun eating the appetizer. When we asked our waitress she said 'its so quiet tonight that they're just really fast bringing out the food.'    When I notified the waitress that the fries were luke warm and that I was not happy with the whole situation she looked at us with a 'wow, I really dont care. wtf are you complaining about' attitude and asked us what we would like her to do.  I guess it was too much to ask of her to just fix the situation. We ended up eating our appetizer as dessert -after- our entree since the entree itself wasnt warm to begin with and didnt want it to cool any further while we ate our appetizers. Then, when we *after* were finished another server brought new fries -which we did not ask for and sent back to the kitchen- ???  To top it off, our server must have noticed that we already had dessert in the form of appetizers and dropped the check at our table without asking whether we wanted dessert. And yes, you've guessed it, everything was on there we paid full price for very poor service and mediocre food.  The beer was good though but thankfully you can get that at a dozen other places throughout the valley."}
{"text":"Kilt lifter is my new favourite beer. And that is coming from a Canadian!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, best staff.  The green chile Mac n cheese is killer, as well as allllll their burgers. You can tell everyone that works there is happy to be there and that's the best part! Love you peaks!!!"}
{"text":"The only place worth coming to in Scottsdale besides the casino. Food was amazing, beer was amazing, and staff was super friendly. Was able to watch my team on TV no problem and always got a refill on my beer before even asking. Prices were super reasonable and I would recommend this place to anyone here visiting."}
{"text":"I've been for lunch half a dozen times and usually sit at the bar.  Their beers are great.  I'm a home brewer and am pretty discerning in my beer tastes.  Their HopKnot IPA has a huge nose of hops if you are a hop lover--which I am.  However the 8th Street Pale is probably my favorite.  It is a great balanced English style pale ale--without the bitter edge of an American pale ale like SN.  On a hot day their Kolsch is super refreshing and reminds me of being in Germany.  I've had mostly burgers and fries there and they are good.  The atmosphere is casual and the staff is friendly and attentive.  If you are a craft beer lover it is a nice laid back destination to enjoy a brew...or two.  They also pour growlers and sell cans of Kolsch and Kiltlifter in 12 packs."}
{"text":"This is by far the best brewery restaurant ever.  We come here at least once a month for the last 8 years,  and have never had a bad meal. You can't beat their IPAs and their seasonals are always amazing. If you come as often as we do you have memorized their menu and often go for the specials. No matter what you can't go wrong at any of their locations. A must eat and drink at stop. Every visitor that comes to see us comes here and requests to come back whenever they are back in AZ."}
{"text":"Great beer, food and service.  A bit pricey, but worth it.  The french fries were amazing and in the top 5 best fries I've ever had."}
{"text":"NOT A PLACE FOR FOOTBALL SUNDAY!!! I stopped in this afternoon for a late lunch and to watch the end of the Phoenix Open and to catch the Super Bowl. The TVs were all on and alternating between the two. SB50 pre game was on but no volume - music played throughout the restaurant and bar. The game was about 5 to 10 minutes from starting and I was hoping to watch the opening ceremonies and national anthem. When we asked if they could turn the TV sound on we were told that it was their \"policy\" to only do so only once the game began. This was a huge game. The 50th anniversary of the Super Bowl. Kinda a BIG deal! The manager on staff at the time refused to turn it on so I had to tab out quickly so that I could take my business elsewhere to watch the game. Everyone at the bar and surrounding tables were saying the same thing and simultaneously we all started to talk about how quickly we could all get the hell out of there. I was very very disappointed by the lack of customer service and obvious lack of pride in an American past time such as the Super Bowl by having such a rigid and non-flexible policy. The manager in charge at the time was very condescending and argumentative. If you want to watch a game this is not the place to go!"}
{"text":"Everyone here is awesome! You just don't find great customer service like this very often. Shout out to Manager Chris Brewer. Extremely interactive with customers ensuring a good time is had by all. And it goes without saying they food and drink here is second to none! Get the Carne Adovada, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good.  I love their Pizzas, however their wine totally sucks. I know this is a Brewery folks and I go with people who like to try their different beers, but since I don't drink beer, what's in it for me?  Their wine is so terrible, their selection is so poor that it spoils my whole evening.  I have been there a couple of times and their wine selection has changed over time, but it seems they pick the same type of wine every time.  No body, no favor.  Yuck!  Come on folks, find someone who knows wine to pick a good selection."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Four Peaks. I usually don't leave yelp reviews but after this visit I had to. It was recommended by some co workers as I haven't lived here long. We split some blackened chicken nachos which were amazing. I had the kilt lifter fish and chips and my friend had the blt salmon sand which. The food is ridiculously good. But what made the visit even better was the exceptionally great waitress named Heather. She explained things to us, offered us some samples to decide on a beer we liked, was courteous and extremely friendly. I would go back to this place just because of the great service she gave to us \"newbies\"."}
{"text":"The food and beer are delicious at this restaurant in north Scottsdale. It's a great Father's Day outing!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot.   Maggie was incredible server.  Friendly, laughed at my dumb jokes and offered creative suggestions.  Awesome.   Very friendly.     The wings are yummy in my tummy.   Luv it.   The nachos are crazy delish.  Great quick lunch spot.  No wait at noon."}
{"text":"Man! What is there not to like about this place? The beer is great, the food is good, the staff is friendly and the after 10 happy hour may be the best in town! I am a huge fan of Four Peaks and their brews. Thanks for doing such a great job guys!"}
{"text":"A OK.  I have been here atleast a dozen times.  Beer is always great.  Food is pretty good, although the salmon BLT was super dry last visit.  Going there with a large party, 9, with out of town family proved to be very bad.  Told us 20 minutes to wait and ended up being over an hour.  Some of the party went home because it took so long which was embarassing to me as I wanted them to have a good dinner.  Next time I will come with a small party.  If there is a next time.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Far and away our favorite restaurant! Great beer! Great atmosphere! Great service! The menu has something for everyone. I've had everything on it. I always have a difficult time deciding on something! There isn't anything I don't like. I especially enjoy the beer breads.  Their daily specials menu is outstanding. We've been coming here since it opened. Our kids love it too! I could go on and on..."}
{"text":"The beer is not brewed on site here but it is good. They have some seasonal selections as well as guest beers. The food is also tasty... Haven't had anything bad yet. The staff is always nice as well. Ways feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Love this place I go here and twin peaks regularly. Enjoy the awesome beer here! Great place for food on game days and there is always a friendly crowd here."}
{"text":"Well I usually don't go by what the newspaper say about places or drinks. But I rarely see Mark Tarbell give anything a 99 but he gave the Four Peaks Brewery a high mark for its Kilt Lifter Scottish Style ale.  I bought a 6 pack and it was in fact amazing.  No headache, although that depends on how much you drink.  Great flavor.   I don't this is is really a Scottsdale Ale because I played gofl with two Scots and they said in there heavy brogues.  Hell no.   Anyway try it at the Brewery or bring some home.  Great pick of the day in the hot summer."}
{"text":"good food and ambiance. casual sports bar to hang out at."}
{"text":"Four peaks you did it again! Ordered the same thing... Fish and Chips (Very good) the service was very fast even though they were extremely busy. FP's has failed to disappoint me!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I frequent this spot a lot. I always get the same burger because I'm afraid to stray when I've found something I like so much! I get the blu light burger (or something along those lines) and my hubby has tried several menu items. I am always happy with my burger. The meat is flavorful and the bacon and blu cheese just adds the extra yum. I also love their fries and the BBQ sauce is killer! Hate beer, but love it in the stout BBQ sauce. The hubby has tried different burgers and always thought they were very good. The one meh burger for him was a daily special of the Elk burger. Said it tasted like it was elk and beef not pure elk. But still enjoyable considering. Recently he tried a spicy pork dish that came with delicious black beans, flour tortillas, and he added scrambled eggs on top. He loved it and even though I'm not big on spicy food...I thought it was very good too. I was disappointed with my margarita (yes I know brewery not a Mexican Food place) but I had it made with Patron and it was weak tasting and I don't think it was patron. Another menu item we've tried (as a side) was the pasta salad. Usually when we get burgers one will get the side of fries and the other gets the pasta salad so we can split them since we both like them.  As far as desserts we've only tried the stout tiramisu and it was a thumbs down. I thought it was going to be the beer take on a tiramisu, but instead of being moist as tiramisu is...this was kind of hard. More like cake with beer tossed on top. Will never try that again. All in all of course we will go back."}
{"text":"Hands down the blackened chicken nachos are the world's best nachos! I have had nachos at literally hundreds of places and have never had better..fresh salsa, real cheese, fresh jalapenos, great blackened chicken, multi colored chips..no microwave  and generous portion...The best!"}
{"text":"Lots of great beer on tap and very friendly staff, try the seasonal Odelay!  I always love the hop knot too  When they have football on it's super LOUD!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been in a long time until we stopped in last night. I think this remains my favorite local place for fish and chips. The beer selection is great and I appreciate a cold draft beer at a reasonable price besides. Our kid is kinda picky and sticks with the chicken strips which are also really good. She always says she'd agree to this place more often if they had fried zucchini lol. The calamari is good (as long as you are ok with panko/strip style instead of breaded rings) and the jalapeño aioli is super good and a different twist on the usual sauces (not a fan of their marinara).  We had the spinach artichoke dip and while it was a nice generous portion for sharing, it wasn't good. It was really dry and almost seemed like something went wrong with it because the texture was weird. None of us liked it and wouldn't order it again although it appears to be a popular app.   The restaurant is always clean and has a pleasant atmosphere (blend of people during normal dining hours, ok for families). It's a little on the noisy side but doesn't bother us. Food is always fresh, good quality and reasonably priced. Nice to have the option to sit outside. We've always had good service and our server last night was super sweet to bring a couple beer samples to try before ordering one. Little things like that, even when they are busy gives the impression they care about satisfying their customers. I've gotten a little more adventurous and enjoy trying different beers these days and it can be hard to know what to pick. We like being able to pop in to a casual place that has good food/service and reasonable prices offering something for everyone to chose from. I'd like to be able to offer opinions on other menu items but we are always craving the dang fish."}
{"text":"I have been working in this area for 12 years and have to say this is my fail safe lunch spot. I look forward to receiving their daily lunch special email as it frequently lures me in. I have several favorites on the menu but really enjoy trying their creation of the day. They always have three unique items to choose from. The go to items in my book would be the salmon blt, chef salad or the French dip sandwich. None of these are your run off the mill variety. The portions are above average with top notch quality and fair prices. Fun and comfortable place to spend your lunch hour."}
{"text":"This place has good service but it takes a while for them to get the food to the table. Ordered the veggie burger I liked it a lot and the fries where fresh so if your near by in Arizona you should try it"}
{"text":"Four Peaks Brewery is a great place to make full use of Happy Hour.  Four Peaks' beer is really good and getting it on the cheap makes it even better.  But what makes inexpensive good beer even more enjoyable is when you can have it with equally-good food.    During my last visit to Four Peaks Brewery I was able to take advantage of their Happy Hour specials on beer, eat their above-average bar food, and watch the NBA postseason on their many big-screen TVs.  I was advised to order a burger, and that guidance didn't steer me wrong.  I ordered their Jalapeno Popper Burger which was cheesy, spicy, and big.  I've never had cream cheese on a burger but this combo was perfect.    At most bars the food takes a secondary role to the drinks.  You would naturally assume the same would hold for a brew pub that is known for their good beer.  Four Peaks has you forget that old adage, as their food manages to be as good as their beer."}
{"text":"Best restaurant / best pub food I've had in the greater Phoenix area.  I got the salmon BLT sandwich and it blew me away.  The bread is really what set it apart from your ordinary sandwich.  I wish they had a Four Peaks in Manhattan.  I would be a regular... I will go back every time I'm in Phoenix fo' sho'."}
{"text":"Service at the bar is top notch.  Beer was excellent.  Food was pretty good.  Packed on a Tuesday.  Worth the visit.  Take home a 6 pack!"}
{"text":"For 14 years I have loved everything about this place.  It is always GREAT, from the food to the beer to the service.  The dedication to this craft for 14 years takes a very special crew of people.  I Love this place."}
{"text":"Since moving to Mesa, AZ two years ago, and loving micro brewed beer as we do, we were anxious to try Four Peaks Brewery for the food fare.  We'd already tried many of their beers available in stores, Kilt Lifter being a favorite.  So while we were in Scottsdale on an errand, we decided to (finally) experience Four Peaks, and dropped in for a late lunch/early dinner on a Saturday afternoon.  Okay, yes...  the place is loud.  Right off, a turn off.  But everyone was friendly and helpful UNTIL it came to dealing with a table of three obnoxiously loud, profane, and alcohol/testosterone driven men.  One of them was actually yelling.  Unpleasant for all the others seated near or adjacent to these clueless & rude individuals, some families with children were at two different tables as well.  We asked management to do something about it, because we couldn't even hear our own conversation.  The manager told us the men at the table in question had paid up and should be moving on soon, but if they didn't, it would be handled and the men would be asked to leave.  No such luck.  After suffering these fools for over an hour, we suffered yet another fool.  The manager.  He apologized to us, but said he \"didn't feel comfortable\" asking the men to move on, or just to simply hold it down.  A ruined meal and a horrible dining experience, not simply because of these loud and lewd men, but because of a spineless manager who demonstrated he cared more about them than he cared for his other patrons, or was afraid of any potential conflict.  Really?  Next time we want this kind of experience, we'll stay home, grill burgers, lift a Santan, and rent \"Jackass, the Movie.\"  Needless to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have some excellent beers. Kiltlifter is the best. Waitstaff is amazing and very attentive. Your glass is never empty for long. My girlfriend and I have been going regularly since we moved to Arizona. definitely our favorite spot so far."}
{"text":"Love the salmon BLT, popper burger and pizzas. This is a great place to grab lunch with a colleague or dinner with the whole family. We love it!!"}
{"text":"Green chile pork poutine was a fantastic appetizer! Green chile pork mixed in with fries and cheese curds!  I was very surprised at how good the food really was. I had a French dip which was perfect. Flavorful au jus, aged swiss, tender meat, onions and mushrooms on a crisp and fresh hoagie roll with those delicious beer battered fries!   My gf had one of the chef specials - flat iron steak with a cilantro polenta and loved it."}
{"text":"We frequent the original Tempe location (since it is close to the home my husband and I share), and I was pleased to learn that my new job in Scottsdale was close to another location of our favorite brewery!    However, upon my first TWO visits, the service was far from acceptable.  The waitress told our table (we were upstairs) that she \"wouldn't be by much\" b/c she had more tables downstairs.  Excuse me??  It got worse when she took our order and got everything mixed up when she brought it out (again blaming us for being upstairs).  She brought beers and set them all at one end of the table and let us distribute them ourselves (since when is this buffet style?!), which she also did with out CHECKS!!  She forgot about bringing me extra ranch, even though I ordered it TWICE, and she didn't bring my husband's food at all.    The second time we were there, the service was marginally better, but not anywhere close to the level we receive at the Tempe location.  My co-workers and I will not be back anytime soon, and my husband and I will stick to the Tempe location.    Bottom line: drive the extra 20 miles (seriously!!) you will be much happier at the end of your meal in tempe, even if you have a bit more of a drive!"}
{"text":"Four peaks is known as one of best local places to get a beer. They also have a good menu featuring sandwiches, pizza, burgers, and other options."}
{"text":"First time at this location. At first glance I was disappointed at the location and the patio. After we sat down and looked around it felt better. We had their hoppy IPA and pumpkin porter. Both beers were really good. We had a nacho and chicken strips. Everything was hot and tasty. Would like to go back and try some other menu items. Beer is always good and the food was seasoned correctly. This place got better once I had a chance experience the food and drink."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!!!!! Lots of different local brews and guest brews. But I usually stick with Raj. Ask for cheese with the pretzels. Alex the server is our favorite!"}
{"text":"Love four peaks! The staff is always friendly and seem to be on top of their game! The food is delicious and the beers are tasty!!"}
{"text":"Man oh man I love this bar. They service is excellent the beer is great. I just opened Dankys Bar-B-Q in phoenix and these guys have been great. Theyve supported me and now we feature their fine craft brews. Long live independent business. CHEERS! !!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a beer person, but they have a full bar and make a pretty good margarita, so I'm good.   My husband goes for the beer (RAJ IPA) and sports, I think they have great food. I love their portabella wrap, dump a bunch of Arizona gunslinger hot sauce (located on every table) on it and heaven! I also really enjoy their gardenburger. I am a vegetarian and get really happy when I have more than one option on a menu. I also really like that you can get a salad rather than french fries. Their honey mustard dressing is really good. My husband loves their fish and chips.  The service is very good and there is a good amount of seating. I prefer the Scottsdale location (I hate the big fans in the Tempe location) but they are both good.  We have gone there with friends, parents, grandparents and everyone was impressed with the food.  We always leave happy."}
{"text":"Best Main Stream Brewery in AZ. Food is very good and pairs with beer selections well.   Highly recommend the burgers and beer bread, but really the whole menu is delectable."}
{"text":"The food was ok, nothing great and nothing bad. The service was ok too. Again, nothing great but nothing bad either. The only thing worth note was we saw our waitress only once. After she took our drink and food order we were taken care of by I assume the  bus boy, and he was fine servicing our needs."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the beer--especially the kilt lifter!  The food is delicious--the popper burger is my fav!   Great place to come and hang out with a few friends!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place very much.  Good food and service.  Good house brew selections.  Fun atmosphere.  Decent parking.  Nice area."}
{"text":"The best fish and chips outside of Harry Ramsden's in the UK."}
{"text":"This was an excellent place to hang out at during a recent trip to AZ.  The food was outstanding and the place was extremely lively for a Monday night.  The beers were good too."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 12 years and it is always a good time.  The staff has good customer service and the food is clean and well made.  I enjoy the specials that are posted daily to add variety to the menu."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt one of the best brew pubs in the valley. Their brews are excellent. They have a great vegetarian pizza, and The shrimp and goat cheese bruschetta appetizer is amazing. All of their dressings and soups are made from scratch, putting a foodie spin on traditional bar food."}
{"text":"Not being from the area, we relied on yelp reviews to find us a late night spot to eat on the 4th of July. Well, we found the perfect place. The food was on point and the service was just as good. We are only here for a couple of days and want to experience the best of Scottsdale. We would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The place was highly recomended by a colleague. We went to watch a football game. The service was mediocre and so was the food. The chips were good. Not impressed by the experience. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Nice selection of local beers, and a few spots for rotating visitors chosen by the barkeep. Dinner time is full, so get there early if you can or don't mind squeezing in at the bar. Tried the Ahi tuna steak sandwich. Cooked perfectly, which means barely at all.  Check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch, dinner. Beer, beer, beer. Mmm...  Our favorite place to watch sports, but a particularly good location to go on football Sundays. You can have breakfast, lunch, and dinner all in the same seat  and never have to move your head to see all the games. If you beat us there, try for the center high-top upstairs... you can see everything, including people watching the door.   Now, this is all great but how about your three meals? Well, have yourself the beer-bread wrap for breakfast... Go with the Thai chicken wings for a lunch snack (actual real size wings), and fish-n-chips for dinner. Forget the calories, you look great. As for beer, I like the IPA with everything, but picking beer for your meal(s) is half the fun.   See you at the center table."}
{"text":"Super rude staff and not good food. Poorly managed and as I said, staff ruins the environment. I work in food and beverage and to see servers and hostesses acting the way they do is embarrassing. Awful awful service and dealt with two separate servers, two hostesses, and the manager. Never going there again!"}
{"text":"A great Brewpub!!  It is about half way between two of my favorite golf stores, so thankfully it  is very convenient for me.  They also have two of my favorite beers - Kilt Lifter and Oatmeal Stout. Consequently, I am here on a regular basis.  I have stopped by at all times of the day - lunch, happy hour, and dinner.  I have to confess, I very seldom eat here - not because the food is bad - but simply because I am usually on my way one place or another.  What I have eaten - burgers, pizza, appetizers - all have been good, but not outstanding.  However, the portions are large and filling.  What stands out are their beers.  Beside my two favorites, the IPA's are solid, and their specialty beers are outstanding.    Although it can get rushed at times, I have always had great service.  My only criticism is that sometimes they do not schedule correctly, and the poor servers are running to keep up.  They do a wonderful job, but you can tell that they have to many tables to serve.   Be aware - it can get busy, particularly at night and during popular games. If you don't like crowds, or just want quiet conversation and drinking, it can be overwhelming."}
{"text":"Four Peaks has a great atmosphere, great food!  Service is awesome too.  I was there the other night celebrating my birthday and we were seated upstairs.  We had to move tables because we were over run by a party in which more and more people kept showing up.  The manager (Maria) was walking around asking if everything was okay and if the people were enjoying themselves.  However, not once did she come to our table.  That was very surprising to me.   Other than the people who took over our space and being completely ignored by the manager it really a nice place.   It is a favorite spot of mine and my friends and family......I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Loved the pork rib tips, the New Yorker and the peach ale.  Second time visited and was not disappointed with food or service!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Four Peaks in Tempe is an astonishing place...Great location and atmosphere....This one tries hard to achieve that same feel, but when attempted in North Scottsdale, it doesn't quite work... The food is decent, but you really come here for the beer.  Four Peaks is a wonderful local brewery that must be sampled by natives and tourists alike. Must drink:  Hop Knot ( for the hophead in you ), 8th Street Ale, and my personal favorite, the Oatmeal Stout ( a work of silky beauty! ) Great place to drink on a Sunday while watching a game, wouldn't recommend for dinner.  For that, go to Tempe and get the black bean nacho deally...Wow! 4 stars 'cause it couldn't pull of Tempe..."}
{"text":"Had dinner here during the game, the service was awesome. The restaurant was on a wait and we went to the bar for a drink before and we were attended to quickly. We had a gal by the name of Judy as our server her beer knowledge was great she helped my husband find his new favorite beer Raj. She walked us through the menu and offered suggestions. We ended up getting a special. Our drinks were always full and a beer was offered at just the right time. I will be bringing my friends here and suggest this to many."}
{"text":"If you like a good variety of great beer and love sports go here. Food is a really good here too (drunk or sober :)   **Drink tip get 3 quarters of their peach ale and 1 quarter Ace Cider (Tastes like melted jolly ranchers) but it's a beer! :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in Arizona for a wedding and found ourselves in Scottsdale to kill time before our flight. We remembered having four peaks kiltlifter the night before so we went here to check out their other brews. Their menu was more inventive than your standard sports grill, we had a BBQ salmon wrap, and the beer was pretty good! We loved the sunbru and 8th street pale ale. The service was also excellent and our waiter had awesome sneakers.  If we ever come back to Scottsdale we will definitely have some more four peaks."}
{"text":"This was super fast service with a very friendly staff. We had our food in a matter a minutes. The nachos are the ultimate best. A super shout to Jamie (red head) for the fantastic friendly service right on point. She is awesome, a total ROCK STAR!!!!. Everyone we had at our table was friendly, efficient and very knowledgeable. A great place"}
{"text":"I don't know what kind of experience the other yelpers had that compelled them to rate this place highly but my take is that they drank too many beers and lost their objectivity. I went to Four Peaks recently and it was NOT GOOD FOOD. I had to send two entrees back bacause of really poor food quality.  Here's the whole story... There were four of us - myself, my musical duo partner, our producer and his 85 year old father who walks with a cane and is obviously physically encumbered. It was relatively busy on a Friday night but not super crazy. First thing, the hostess asked if we wanted to sit outside, which was a \"no\" due to Pop's difficulty navigating - should have been obvious to the hostess. Then she asked if a HighBoy table was OK - again a no - same reason - again should have been really obvious. There was an empty 6 top right next to the hostess stand and the front door. Pops asked if we could just sit there and one of the hostess had the nerve to say \"No, there are only four of you and we are saving that in case we have a larger party come in.\" Really??? Here's an old man with a cane who is limping in to your establishment and you have attitude? After a bit of stunned disbelief, one of the other hostesses decided it was ok for us to sit down at this 6 top. I should have known at this point that this wasn't going to be a pleasant dining experience.  So, on to ordering dinner. I am trying to eat gluten free and the menu was not gluten-free friendly. I ordered chicken enchiladas - chicken, corn tortillas, rice, beans, green sauce - sounds good - fairly safe, right? Pops had a chili verde chimichanga. Other guys had a salad and a tenderloin sandwich. Food came out fairly quickly. Pop's chimichanga wasn't a chimichange at all - it was a burrito. In my mind, a chimichanga is typically a deep fried burrito of sorts but this never saw a deep fryer. He couldn't cut through the rubbery tortilla and only ate about third of it. He said the filling was bland and not good. They took it away. He was nice about it but obviousy dis-satisfied. (Plate prep and presentation was poor, too - it was exactly like my enchilada presentation - read on.) My chicken enchiladas were made out of the smallest size raw dry corn tortillas rolled up with a little pre-made dry chicken filling (more like small taquito sized) set on a gigantic plate with a liquidy swimming pool of bean juice that looked like vomit covering almost half of the plate. Rice was really dry and horribly undercooked and crunchy. There was a small teaspoon sized splat of runny green sauce on the side. Then it looked like the chefs threw cheese on top and tossed the whole thing under the broiler. The bottom of the enchiladas were stuck to the plate - obviously put on the plate dry - and then not sauced at all. Now enchiladas should be cooked in sauce with cheese on top melted in the oven and in no way dry. Miserable fail #1. Everything about this dish was not done well. I would have to say bad kitchen. I sent it back. Server was polite and asked if I would like to order something else - which I did. I ordered an Italian Beef sandwich with no bread since they didn't have any gluten free bread options - expecting a nice juicy bowl of thin sliced beef with some onions, peppers, and cheese. What did I get? A bowl full of coagulated, probably microwaved cheese, with a few CHUNKS (yes chunks) of dry tasteless beef (cooked hours before and left to die on the prep table) and some undeterminable vegetable mush that was also probably pre-cooked much earlier in the day. The manager came and asked how it was before I even took a bite - told her It didn't look like any Italian beef I had ever seen before - not juicy and delicious looking - she said that was because I ordered it with no mayonaisse and that would have made it juicier (HUH??) - but I said I would try it and let her know. Server came over after one bite and I told her the same thing. I really tried to eat a few bites, rather unsuccessfully. Then I picked up the whole mass of congealed food with my fork and was able to hold it up like a popsicle (poopsicle). The rest of the table laughed and I told them if I was really being Gordon Ramsay about it I would say it looked like the inside of a baby's diaper. It was DISGUSTING!!!  Dry, tasteless, and just gross. When the sever came over again, I told her basically everything I just wrote and additionally told her to have the chef and the manager taste it -  best solution to fixing a dish is to taste what is wrong with it, right? I guess not because she immediately put the whole thing into the bus tray and didn't even give feedback to the chef or the manager. THEN she had the nerve to try to sneak this second dish onto the bill. When we checked and had her remove it, she got really cold and didn't talk to us the rest of the evening, which thankfully wasn't much longer.  I cannot believe that they get away with serving this crap and remain in business.  BAD FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place it's the perfect neighborhood bar. Great craft brews, my favorite is the hefeweizen but there seasonal beers are also top notch. Food is great as well, I usually snack on appetizers like the spinach artichoke dip and spanakopita and they are always great. I have had entrees a couple times and they are also good. Service is top notch and friendly would always recommend for food or drink!!"}
{"text":"Good beer and drinks. Good food. Big menu. Loud. Fun place to meet up with friends, bring the family and watch the game."}
{"text":"Best burger and beer in the area. On top of that everything on the menu is delicious and you can always try something new on their daily specials menu. The staff is incredibly friendly and they know their product forwards and backwards. With an awesome craft brew selection that accommodates all tastes, I would definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations now. Here's what I have to say about the Scottsdale one....very poor service. Took forever to order something to go at the bar. I finally ordered and the woman took my money...she gave me the wrong change (mistakes happen, I let this slide, for the time being). She came back with my order....I walk out and pretty much drove away only to figure out she gave me the wrong order. I go back in and ask her for the correct one...and to put ketchup in the bag. Silly me I didn't check for ketchup, got all the way back to work, and surprise there wasn't any (what are fries without ketchup??). Only reason I gave this place three stars is because the food is awesome. Next time I will be going to the one in Tempe. Food is even better and service was impeccable at the Tempe location."}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot and honestly a go-to for me and most of my friends. The beer is always solid (ask for the Bourbon-Barrel-Aged Kiltlifter, never advertised, offered rarely, but incredibly worth it) and the food is a cut above typical bar food. For real, apples to oranges kind of comparison. Only downfalls, parking can be a problem and the place is hopping almost any day of the week so if you've got a group of 4 or more it can be tricky getting a spot together right away. Staff is decent too. They usually have the menu and beers down like pro's but with a busy spot like this if you're in a rush and need constant attention this might not be the place for you."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, very nice casual bar and restaurant. If you are looking for a nice place to eat and drink I would recommend going here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Service and food were both amazing! My family was in town from Idaho for the holidays and I took them there since it's a local brewery. My mom loved it so much she said she would be fine going there every day. Possibly the best wings any of us had ever had. The burgers were Delish and cooked perfectly. We also enjoyed the 80's playlist of music they had on. Just moved in the area and will for sure become a regular! Yum!"}
{"text":"Never a disappointment! We live close by. My favorite brewery! My favorites are The seasonal pumpkin beer, Hefeweizen, the peach beer and of course you can not go wrong with Kiltlifter! Always good food and good service! Among our many visits, I have hosted a Happy Hour here for my Hiking group with a turn out of 20-30 people on a busy Friday night and everyone had a great time and we had great service and great food! Very accommodating,Thank you!"}
{"text":"so i moved into a place across the street for the tempe location of 4 peaks before it had concrete laid outside...before it had a liquor license, and before it had a food menu.  so my history with what is available and what's good...what's come and gone is long and  detailed.  i have not written a review of the tempe location because i know it's quality is beyond words....   that being said, i met some friends for breakfast last sunday @ the scottsdale location.  while the food was good it was not great and we noticed the potatoes that are being served are the frozen bag precut variety....and that was a bummer.  the eggs benedict was awesome but the potatoes were lacking with the same home fries quality that i'd come to know and expect.  our order was slow to be taken, and slow to come out,  not too bad because friends and i were there to catch up and what not.  overall i didnt have a bad experience and none of my friends did either just different... and somehow less than the tempe location is known to offer.  plus the lack of the good home fires was a disappointment"}
{"text":"A great after work hangout, it gets pretty loud in there. Fine brewery has at times very good food, tvs, and service. I've been there so many times I've worn it out."}
{"text":"great little spot in tempe...always have a great time here and tonight did not disappoint, the worst thing is I can never decide on what  I want more, a reuben or french dip. :) love the beers and atmosphere, always really quick to get food out and the service is always good."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite restaurant in the valley. We started going to the Tempe Four Peaks location when we were at ASU, but have since moved up north. Luckily, they have another restaurant by us! The location is a bit odd (essentially behind Party City, in a strip mall) but the food and beer is amazing.  Our favorites are: the popper burger, Italian beer bread (wrap), beer battered fries, buffalo wings, peach ale and kiltlifter. I'm sure there are MANY great options, but we've been stuck on the same order for a while because it's so good! I would like to try the french dip because every time I see someone order it, I get pretty jealous.   The portions are huge (I always get a second meal out of mine) and the prices are fair.   Overall it's just an awesome place and I would recommend it 100%."}
{"text":"Had breakfast/brunch at the Four Peaks Restaurant and Brewery. I thought the food was okay although too much seasoning/ salt. The price was way too high for breakfast. I think our bill came to just under $70 (does not include the tip), for four people. That's for breakfast! On the bright side, the service was very good. Considering everything, I doubt if we'll go back there."}
{"text":"Always excellent service at the bar, huge menu and beer selection. The food is great especially the nachos with blacken chicken."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite on the way to Taliesin West - thanks yelpers for helping us land here.  Quickly seated, super efficient waitress, chicken beer bread for me (which is really like a wrap - but it was delish). Husband got the double nachos, which are smothered in cheese and beef and have their own pot of more goodies to dump on top..  Nice.  Kid ate a burger - thumbs up...we got out of there and up the road in the nick of time.  Efficient, fast, family friendly - it gets four stars for being a good sports bar"}
{"text":"What can i say, Four Peaks! The food, the drinks, amazing! The Odelay, Salmon BLT, and I experienced a tryst I'm sure none of us shall ever forget. I've been to both the Tempe and Scottsdale locations and I applaud the menu! One recommendation for new customers would be to not to expect a top notch attitude from servers as this is the only caveat preventing a 5-star status. But hey, I'd prefer great food and drinks to someone smiling and being nice to me whilst serving mundane bar food."}
{"text":"Good local beer... Interesting food which definitely not what you would expect from a beer bar, but then again, it is Scottsdale...."}
{"text":"Awesome food and beer every single time!  The hunny and I like either the az chicken rolls or nachos to start.  The sunbru and hefewiezen are awesome beers from four peaks.  Our all time fav entree is the chicken beer bread- great w the fries but sometimes we'll get the side salad with homemade honey mustard.  Four peaks is our #1 choice for a casual beer-centric meal.  Great food, service, and beer!"}
{"text":"If you get the 1/2 size Nacos it is the perfect amount. Not the best place drinks wise if you are not a beer person... then again it is a brewery. I am just unable to drink beer due to allergies. So some more drink specials would be appreciated."}
{"text":"As always, I cannot say enough positive about this place. Great brews. Great food. Great staff."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with the nearby Twin Peaks, although they both serve beer.  As others have said, the food is good.  The Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale is very good.  I wish they'd get some in Seattle, but since Pike's Brewery already has a Kilt Lifter named beer, it may be problematic.  The Hopknot IPA is very nice, but the RAJ IPA is a little different (not my current flavor preference)."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner. Great service and atmosphere. The chicken tenders are the best we've ever eaten, salad was fresh, chicken roll appetizers were amazing. Go here- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the fish n chips for lunch last week. Not traditional British style that I like the most, but the method resulted in scrumptious bites. The fish was battered skinny bits, resulting in more batter CRUNCH per bite. The shape also lends itself to be a utensil-free meal -  you can dip into the tartar sauce. The fries were lightly crunchy medium steak fries. They were OK. The $3 8th Street Ale was a perfect addition. INSIDE SKINNY: There's something on tap for $3."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE BY MANAGEMENT!!!  My sister, fiancé, and I arrived tonight around 6:30pm. We were carded outside, before even entering the restaurant. My 21 year old sister who's never been here before says, \"ohh, is this place like a club?\" Who cards outside a restaurant at 6:30pm? Ummm, ok.  Our server was super sweet and really attentive and we really enjoyed her. She does NOT have a part in this review. My sister and I both order sangrias. Fiancé orders a sample of a beer. She drops off sangrias at the same time as his sampler. He tries it, orders a different beer as well as wings.  Wings come out about 10 minutes after being ordered, fiancé asks the food runner who drops them off if he could order a beer (same beer he ordered with the server but since it had been so long he thought she may have forgotten). Food runner says, \"No, but I can get your server.\" Attitude!!!! Fiancé says, \"Oh, well I asked her but it's been about 10 minutes.\" Fiancé wasn't even rude, just wanting his beer?! We are understanding to the fact that she was busy and may have forgot, that's why we asked someone else...   5 or so minutes later manager comes over with beer and says, \"Who ordered the sunbru?\" Fiancé says, \"I did.\" Manager says rudely, \"Can I see your ID?\" First of all, we got carded outside before entering, my fiancé is a doctor with a full grown beard at 29 years old. Yeah, totally underage. (Are you not keeping tabs of your employees with carding correctly?) My (barely 21 year old) sister and I who look younger are sitting with drinks in front of us but yet don't get carded? How convenient. Also, we noticed a security guard standing next to manager while he's carding my fiancé. Classy  For our entrees, different food runner delivers food, and a nice female manager (different than the previous one) \"checks on us\" throughout our dinner. Terrible service by management that should have been handled WAY differently, and honestly, we are regulars at your establishment and we will NEVER return to this location again.  By the way, our server did tell us she forgot to ring his beer in.. Interesting how things happen, eh?? Enjoy your 1 star."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Fri evening joint! Lively, good food, great beer and good service. We love the fish n chips! The peach flavored beer and tea flavored cocktail is light, flavorful and chilled perfectly. I recommend this place. No wonder they are so full."}
{"text":"We have been traveling down the west coast and stopping for dinner at brewery's along the way.  This place by far had the best food and beer! Recently I tried a mule and it was fantastic too! We have sampled many food items from the amazing French fries, pizza and fried tomatoes to  the burgers and sandwiches...Never disappointed! Great wait staff, fair prices! You can pick up a six pack to go for cheaper than it sells for in the store!"}
{"text":"Food: Compared to most pub grub, this place is fantastic! Most items are easily vegetarian-ized without any attitude.  Since I've been a regular in 2004, the menu has changed very little if at all (I haven't noticed anything chagned, but then again I'm not exactly perusing the hamburger/beef section of the menu).  Though the menu is pretty static, they do have some fantastic daily specials for lunch and dinner that aren't always prominent, so you might have to ask specifically to see that menu.  Beer: Obviously this is why you came here -- cue personal mental battle between Peach Ale and Hefewiezen (usually Peach wins).  For those who drink \"real\" beer, the 8th Street Ale or KiltLifter may be more to your liking.  Setting: Loud. TVs galore.  It's a bar after all... They have a great (smaller) patio and part of the dining room opens to the patio.  Staff: Your typical hot girl set.  No haughtiness or lack of service whether I'm part of a large group or flying solo at the bar with other regulars.    Parking: The section of parking lot right in front is ALWAYS full, so really, don't even bother trying.  The larger lot adjacent always has plenty of spots.  Common sense warning: This place is popular and the cops know it.  I've been stalked in the parking lot and one time even followed for a few miles before being pulled over for \"driving at or below the speed limit\".  I didn't get a DUI because I only had a few beers and waiting awhile before leaving, but be careful and be SMART! :)"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite brewery. Customers sit in the same building as the brewing vats and the atmosphere is just buzzing with conversations.  I have a little tradition here. I start with the Hefeweizen, then move on to the Kiltlifter, then finish off with the Oatmeal Stout. Then maybe another stout, then another, okay, just one more.  The food is also top notch. Everything from the nachos to the beer battered fries to the beer bread is good. I've tried them all. They also have a different list of dinner specials every night.  If you're into beer this is a place you can't miss."}
{"text":"Pub like environment, very casual.  Good music playing (like Bob Marley) but it was a little too loud during lunch.  I ordered iced tea and it was very good.  It was the fruity kind.  For lunch i got the ceasar salad with salmon.  It was really good.  The dressing on it was OK but the salmon was killer.  Good service.  Good to see a manager on duty making sure all was running smoothly.   It was lunch so I wasn't drinking but I know that all these beers are really good.  I always get the Kiltlifter and the 8th St Ale."}
{"text":"BAH HUMBUG!  I can only hope this was a bad experience because the restaurant was overwhelmed with the holiday traffic.  Went in on Monday night with our family for dinner.  Our server, Ana, greeted us and took our drink order.  She seemed very stressed with the amount of tables she had.  Some time later she returned with the drinks and offered to take an appetizer order.  We gave her our choices (bavarian pretzels and chicken nachos).  She asked if we also knew what we wanted for our entrees.  We told her yes and gave her those choices as well.  After about 20 minutes when nothing had arrived and our beverages sitting empty she stopped by the table and asked if we wanted something additional to drink.  We ordered another round and inquired about our apps.  She said they were almost ready.  My wife said, \" Ok, I just want to make sure our entrees don't come out at the same time.\"  Ana assured us they wouldn't because of how she had rung it all in.     Well, 5 minutes later guess what happened?!   Yup, it all came out within 60 seconds of one another.  Ana must have sensed our frustration and apologized for the \"kitchen being overwhelmed!\"  The kitchen?  No accountability on her part whatsoever!    Ok, so you messed up or your kitchen messed up, who cares the important thing is to make things right for the customer, right?  Ana's solution, \"If there are any apps you don't want I can take them away and take them off your bill.\"  REALLY?  How about, \"I'm really sorry about the timing of your food.  Please enjoy the apps on us and I'll have them taken off your bill.\"  We told her to take the nachos away since they were actually COLD, clearly sat in the window waiting for other food to finish.  She did and they were taken off the bill.    Final result - Our check was presented with no mention of the nachos on it so she honored her commitment there.  Everything else was on it though, FAIL!  My wife did fill out a comment card and gave it to the hostess on our way out.  Will be interesting to see if she here's back from any of the managers."}
{"text":"Love the patio and the beers but was disappointed by the slow service and the somewhat mediocre food. One exception, the pretzels with beer cheese dip were excellent. The server was friendly but slow to check on us with the restaurant half empty. I would go back for the patio and beers but probably skip the food."}
{"text":"I happened to be in Scottsdale on business and I was really happy when I found out there was a Four Peaks in the area.  I frequented the Tempe location when I lived in the area so this was a real pleasant surprise.  In any case, we landed at 10:30 and made a b-line to the bar before retiring for the night.  We arrived an instantly things got even better....late night happy hour....awesome.  We grabbed some pretzels to soak up the beer.  They might be the best pretzels I've ever had.  Throw in the great beer and service and you have someplace with a little soul in the midst of the urban sprawl.  I'm glad to see the Four Peaks folks doing well enough to expand."}
{"text":"Awesome food for a great price.  Been here mostly for lunch and service can be a bit slow since it's so busy.  That being said, the food it awesome.  I've always gotten the Popper Burger with fries...  it's hard to stray from this tried and true.  A couple of times I've felt like I ate too much afterwards.  Given the prices of other places in Scottsdale, this definitely is a good value for the money.  You can easily pay more for worse and less food."}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch, watch any sports game on TV or Happy Hours. Service is standard and the normal pub food is to be expected. Portions are quite large which is good if your starving!  They also brew their own beer so make sure to try one."}
{"text":"Man this place is the most consistent best restaurant in the air park.  Despite their expansion to multiple locations including the Phoenix Airport, these guys have kept quality at a very high level.  They have simplified their menu through the years, but having been an avid customer of the Tempe shop when I was a college brat, the Scottsdale location is a fitting grown up version of the same great beer and even better food.  Not your typical pub-grub.  Goat cheese, great salads, some gluten free options, these guys remain on their game."}
{"text":"Southwestern burger with cheese, green chile and chipolte mayo was the best burger I have had in a long time.  Washed it all down with a peach ale.  Definitely will return.   The drink order was taken promptly but then the waitress poofed for a what seemed a really long time.  We were in no particularly hurry on a Saturday but would have been a problem if it had been a work day.  Fix that problem and it would have been a five star lunch."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from Four Peaks.  I'm a regular patron and have been going there for years.  It has a rustic comfortable feel that I like.  The staff is usually welcoming.  The food is very tasty.  I like most everything on the menu, and it's reasonably priced.  I rarely drink so you know the food and atmosphere would have to be good for me to keep coming back.  I'd say the 2 downfalls of the place are when you're seated at the bar right in front of the bartenders it seems difficult to get their attention and decent service.  It's hit and miss but I'd say poor service at the bar has been a more common experience than not.  The other improvement that could be made would be to add more healthier choices to their menu.  I'd go there more often if they offered lighter healthier choices on the menu.  Nachos, burgers with fries, pizzas are all heavy.  It'd be nice to be able to have more vegetarian and salad choices."}
{"text":"Four Peaks is our favorite place for great beer and food! We have been going there since it opened and few places can achieve the consistent level of excellent beer, food and quality service as this establishment. They are very creative with their menu and always have a variety of beer that is sure to please all tastes.  We are impressed how they manage the sports viewing on the many TV's. Whenever a game has ended, a manager is there immediately to switch to another game of the customer's choice. This is a rare level of service displayed by many of the so-called sports bars here in the valley. The majority of the staff at both the Grill & Tap and the original 8th St. location have been there for many years so that tells us that is is a well- run organization. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the seasonal Pumpkin Porter. It's darker than I normally order, but it didn't have the harsh aftertaste.  We ordered wings to share. They were OK nothing special. I shared the Chicken Beer Bread sandwich. It is like a wrap cut into 4 pieces which makes it easy to share. I really liked it. Lots of artichoke hearts and mozzarella cheese. I tasted the Thai Hummus. It was good and spicy.  The bathroom stunk, literally.  Parking was tough and we ended up far down the street.  Good beer, good food.  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"First time here, and had an awesome time. Four Peaks had great food, great drinks (lots of both), and an excellent staff. The two things to know are that basically everything on the menu is good, and that you will get a lot of food and drink!   For drinks -- My boyfriend ordered the flight of beer, and he had to reassure the waiter that he was going to split the flight with me, because the amount of beer in the flight was quite a bit (more than they could serve to one person)!.   For food -- We were hungry, so we ordered some appetizers (poutine and spinach artichoke dip, both of which were awesome). However, the appetizers were of large portions and we were pretty full by the time our main dishes came around. We ordered the Italian beef beer bread and salmon BLT and were able to eat some of it before asking the rest of the food to be boxed up to-go. Everything was delicious and even the leftovers were awesome!   Also, I wanted to give a shout out to the waiter/waitress staff. They were so kind about providing us suggestions, they were happy and eager to help, and they went above and beyond in helping us with our drink selection. Our waiter even brought along a mini-flight of the holiday craft beers...just because!   I would love to come here again!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game! Pizza - Pepperoni with Sausage and Bacon added (Excellent - the Bacon was Fantastic!) Buffalo Wings (Good) Mac n Cheese (Great)"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar by Michaella today! The beer breaded chicken sandwich was very good and the French fries were very tasty!  Also had the side salad and it was ok.  My friend had the gyro special and he thought it was good too!  Lots of great beers on tap and others in the restaurant were definitely enjoying. This was my third time at this location and service and food were consistently good! Recommend!"}
{"text":"Four Peaks isn't what I remember it once was. Years ago their Tempe location made me a big fan - the outstanding beer and food was something to get excited about. This trip to North Scottsdale was different. The service was subpar as the server wasn't friendly or helpful with suggestions. If a server hasn't tried half the menu, then why is she a server?  Everything was mediocre. The special Patty Melt and the Brie burger were very average, bland burgers at best. The fries were just ok.  Unless you are going to drink, and only drink at this location, I sadly wouldn't recommend it anymore. I'll stick to buying their beer at the store."}
{"text":"Never Ever had a bad thing from any of the locations & this one is not an exception. Food, beer & service always ACES. Can't beat the portion size. If I don't share I always have yummyness for the next days lunch. The beers are bar none. Can't beat them if you tried. Wide variety of craft beers & you can take them home to watch your next sporting event. Can't sing the praises of this place enough. Now that they've gotten in bed with Anheuser-Busch I've been to Vegas & got to enjoy my faves there too. Can't hate on that. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Four Peaks is probably the best local brews in Phoenix and I always make it into one when I am in town. I have been to both the Scottsdale as well as the Tempe locations.  The Scottsdale location is newer and has more seating than the Tempe location which always seems to have a line. When we went we were seated right away.  We came in time for happy hour and got a pitcher of their famous Kilt Lifter brew. Our waitress was so-so. She took our order and checked in on us what seemed like every 20 minutes. She was actually more worried about the guys only tables than she was about us (since we had a female). Our food was brought to us by different waiters.  We ordered the mediterranean pizza and the salmon BLT. The large pizza cost $18 but was more than enough for our group. Although I felt they kind of skimmed on the cheese. The salmon BLT was delicious. The salmon was fall apart and not one bit dry at all.    Overall the Scottsdale location was solid. It's in a busy part of Scottsdale and the parking is in a major plaza so you don't have to worry about parking on an unlit street like the Tempe location. The fact that it was also larger in size was also a plus because we had to wait over a half an hour in Tempe. The brews are good, the food is good, they're got all the TVs you need, there's out door seating by a fire, and overall the servers were good; with the exception of our waitress.    Conclusion::::::::: Beer = A Prices = B ($5-20 for beers and food) Servers = B Location = A  If Four Peaks doesn't tickle your fancy then there's always Twin Peaks in the same plaza ;)"}
{"text":"Blonde house beer is awesome, very similar to a Blue Moon, maybe better! Good burgers and great location indoors and outdoors for watching a football game."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer connoisseur?  (happy with a Bud lite), and I think beer is this joint's claim to fame. The food is incredibly average, not notable."}
{"text":"This is the best spot in the Air Park. Why? They are arguably the best brewery in AZ, the food is pretty DG, and it's close to my work. Why have twin peaks when you can have four? BOOM case closed you should eat here if you're reading this."}
{"text":"The lamb burger was incredible. The beer selection was spot on as well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, normally I just go there for beers (which are most excellent) but I decided to eat there twice in the last few weeks.  Both times, I couldn't believe the food.  Having eaten too much bar food in my life, I think I am finally growing up...  The first time I was with a group of friends visiting from Las Vegas, and we pretty much worked the appetizers & pizzas.  The food was great, and everyone really enjoyed it .    The second time I went, I happened to be eating alone and had the chef's special (some fish).  Fish is easy to screw up and difficult to master, but this was one of the best pieces of fish I have ever eaten.  In both cases I went, the service, music (some sweet 80's & 90's jams were playing) & food were amazing, not to mention the beer.  Nothing compares to a glass of the pumpkin porter.    If you are looking for a good hearty meal, go there.  I've never had a bad beer or meal there."}
{"text":"I love this place. Friendly staff. Great food. Great beer. Not much else to say. This is my favorite brewery."}
{"text":"I love Four Peaks. The Grill in North Scottsdale is much closer to my house than the Tempe Brewery and it is air conditioned. It's the best place to go in the summer to get your Kilt Lifter."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night around 9 PM.  One of the few places around here that's open past 9/9:30 PM.  Not too busy and service was prompt.  Salad with grilled Salmon was huge.  Enough salad for 4 people, Salmon was moist and good portion, though I would expect as much for $16.  Burger's flavor was good, frys were thick cut which is what I prefer.  Bun was decent and held burger.  Only issue was burger was over done, ordered medium rare, came out well done so very dry.  Manager took off few bucks without us even asking, I wasn't going too since I had already finished half of it.  Over all great experience, good bar food, lots of TVs if you want to watch a game, service and management no issues.  This will probably be our go to place if we want to eat out \"late\" in this area."}
{"text":"The husband and I ate at this location for the first time Sat evening. We ordered pretzels as an appetizer and they came out still cold in the middle from being frozen. When we mentioned it to our server, she apologized and brought out a fresh dish a few minutes late which were hot. We shared a pizza, it was good not great. Peach beer was delicious as always. Three star experience overall. Nothing terrible, nothing great."}
{"text":"Best bar food around! oh and the beers are pretty good too. Probably one of the best  brewery's in the Valley. The patio is a cool place to hang out at. They have misters out and heat lamps, so you can sit out there all year long. It gets pretty loud inside especially on Friday nights. Not a bad place to watch a game, but what's with all the Viking fans?? Everything is great about this place, great hangout with buddies, watch the game and just need a good beer."}
{"text":"This is always the \"go to\" place for me and friends.  Usually open late.  Bartenders are always knowledgeable of product and the chicken strips are to die for!  Go here for a good drink and awesome bar food."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Arizona, I was looking for a place to hang out, have a couple of beers, and watch the Green Bay / Cardinals playoff game in a comfortable location. We settled on Four Peaks (which is strangely near Twin Peaks of scantly clad women fame), and settled in for the game.  I wouldn't say this is the nicest establishment to watch a game. It did get EXTREMELY loud mainly because of some idiot Packers fans getting excited for a simple 5 yard catch. So loud in fact that our AMAZING waitress ended up talking to them about the idea of calm behavior when someone runs for a 2 yard gain. Awesome, and probably the best part of this place. The food was average with wings that were dry and overcooked, and other appetizers that offered little in flavor. The beer, which was brewed in house, was some of the better local brews I had tasted on this trip.  If you can't tell, this was a visit of ups and down. What the atmosphere and food were lacking, was made up by the service and the beer. I'm not sure I'll be back, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't try it out for yourself to see if you can get all four qualities to work in your favor."}
{"text":"They have the best food!! There is nothing that I don't enjoy on the menu and it is all creative and fresh. Nothing generic about this place. Not a huge beer fan but they have a great selection. The chicken tenders and fries are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I always have a great time when I go here.  The atmosphere is friendly and the staff is great.  The food is Preety cool too.  I like the bar area as well. It's a cool hang out spot with all the pretty people."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by last weekend to watch football and sample a couple of their brews.  The food was great could be some of the best french fries I've ever had.  The beer was good.  Noticed almost everyone drinking the house beers so it was nice to see that kind of support for an established micro brew.  There was a large crowd for football many folks wearing jerseys and everyone really getting into their game.  If your looking for an energetic place to watch football and grab a good bite this would be a place to consider.  UPDATED 04/05/2012 lowered to 3 stars.  I have been here a couple times since my first review and it really is just an average place.  The fries are the highlight.  The place is small, loud and well your AVERAGE pub or brewery."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years...we actually bonded over their Kiltlifters..haha! We always enjoy coming here, whether its for food or drinks. Great service and their food is always amazing! Great American food and drinks."}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice and attentive. This place is great to watch games as the booths have their own personal TV. Food is typical bar food which was great."}
{"text":"Nice Local craft pub.  Service was good and prices were normal.  It was fun to have their tasting flights of different lines of brews.  Plenty of space but we went on an off-lunch time.  There is not a lot of parking in front but plenty behind in the shopping area.  Open air front of the building keeps the front areas from being too dark and closed in.  Dropped screens protect from the afternoon sun."}
{"text":"Always a favorite for good beer and good food. Green chile Mac and cheese and turkey club are my favorites. And the Raj IPA is my go to."}
{"text":"Go to The Yard House.... For Beer and Food....  Yes - The Yard House is chain but their food is 100000x.  The menu actually sounds more appealing and the food actually is better..  I was looking forward to going to 4 Peaks after hearing great things.  I certainly enjoy a nice cold beer.  (Which they don't have at 4 Peaks - b/c apparently room temperature and slightly colder are the perfect temps to bring out the flavor?!?!  - if thats the case - then why was the frosty mug created?)  Our water was great - straight up honest about what he likes and didn't in regard to the menu - which I really appreciate.  Overall - unimpressed...."}
{"text":"Maybe it was my fault, I ordered A rueben sandwich, & no beer. This place was husbands pick.  Rueben was solid, just  nothing out of the ordinary, I did see chicken strips being delivered to someone else and contemplated snagging one in retribution, they looked of golden perfection as were the fries."}
{"text":"Great beer, good bar food, just a good fun place to hang out, have a beer with the guys and relax.  Service is almost always outstanding."}
{"text":"All the beers are great, didn't and wont try the peach one though.  My favorite is the Raj IPA great strong flavor.    The food is what really sets this place apart though.  The Salmon BLT is one of my favorite sandwiches in town.  Arizona rolls also must be tried by all."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is almost as good as the beer! Great in-house selection and solid guest taps. The food puts this place over the top though. Pull pork is amazing. Tito the bartender is always helpful and provides you with great insight to the beer and food this place has to offer."}
{"text":"Been going to Four Peaks for several years when we get back to Scottsdale.  The beers haven't changed in quality.  Still excellent with something for everyone.  Only issue we had (and we were there twice in a week) was the first night, when one of the wait staff was closing up well before closing time... guess she was in a hurry to get home."}
{"text":"I love Four Peaks, but I think I'm spoiled by the Tempe location.  The Scottsdale location has a patio, but it's not as nice as Tempe's.    The servers are great in both places, the food is great in both places, and of course the beer is awesome.  The Peach Ale is my favorite.  I would say if you can make it to Tempe, go to that location, but this is a darn good second choice.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food, beer, and service. Definitely give the popper burger a shot if you're looking for something interesting and with a kick, also goes great with the beers."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely terrible,not only our table but the next to us also, and they looked like they were going to walk out.  Food was ok, chicken salad pita was nothing to rave about, beer was good but was diappointed after hearing such great things..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what these other people are talking about, but this is my fav spot for food. The beer, while delicious, is an after thought for me. I have always experienced great service, excellent food and friendly staff. I'm there at least once a week for take out and once a week for dine in.  I'm one of those people who order the same thing over and over, but here I have tried everything and I love it all. Best spinach artichoke dip in the valley and the calamari is unreal."}
{"text":"I just don't like the people who work here.  They act like teenagers (texting, rolling eyes, ignoring customers while chatting with friends or flirty patrons) and I want a more grown-up experience when going out for a beer.  The only thing I like about this place is the Kiltlifter and the Turbodog (yes, they have non-Four Peaks taps!)  I also hate going into places where I can't use my iPhone browser."}
{"text":"Tasty brews, consistently good food and decent service has recently made this dim, saloon style establishment a new haunt. The happy hour is a steal! Craft beers for $3.25 and pitchers for $12. Typically there are nine brews on tap and several seasonals to provide a nice range.  A pitcher of Kilt Lifter is a staple for my table, but I also have enjoyed the rotating tap. The current seasonal, ML209, is light for summer yet at 8.7% alcohol gives me the kick I enjoy. I love IPA's but it's the only brew that has disappointed.    Food portions are huge and recommended for sharing. The spinach dip with tortilla chips and pita is a must in addition to the 7 barrel fries and 5 layer nachos. Skip the hummus, bleh! I've heard the Bavarian pretzels are good and the pizzas looks great too! The bloody mary is a meal in itself with a plethora of garnishes. Spicy, great for some hair-of-the-dog on Sunday and only $5!   I enjoy the inside yet outside feel of the Tempe location, but the openness of the Scottsdale location is great as well in addition to a shady patio. I'm waiting to receive a growler as a gift to enjoy Four Peaks ales at all times!"}
{"text":"We stopped by after a local event for a late luncheon.  We tried the seasonal brews for Octoberfest (Martzen) and Pumpkin something something brew.  The Marten matched expectations and appropriately was flat by American beer standards.  A solid good example of its type.     The pumpkin stout something whatever was good according to my heterosexual life partner.    We also tried the fish & chips and beef au jus.    The fish was overdone nearing burnt.  Not good but not bad.  The chips were good.   The beef with sauteed onions au jus was very good.  Also tried was the Raj India Pale Ale. This brew was more in keeping with the English tradition of IPA rather than American hyper hopped IPAs.  I would describe it as \"okay\" but not a superlative experience.  Our service from Dominique was very good.  She was warm, friendly, cheerful and efficient.  What items we ordered were delivered quickly.  Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a casual meal.  It's obviously a pub atmosphere but it's large enough to accommodate a lot of people without it getting crowded.  They also have many well placed flat screen tvs. (I just wish they would turn on the closed captioning!  Its one thing if you're watching a sporting event but when they have on an analysis show I want to hear the analysis!)   My husband had the beer sampler and enjoyed most of the varieties, the Raj IPA was his favorite (the 8th Street Ale and Kiltlifter are the more popular ones).  We had the soft pretzel appetizer which was ok, but I'm spoiled when it comes to pretzels having lived in Philly and lived on them for my entire college career.   I wish it came with a honey mustard to dip in and not just regular spicy mustard.  I had the French Dip which was solid - not the best I've had but still pretty good.  My husband had the Tap Room Tenderloin sandwich that he enjoyed - the onion straws and bleu cheese were a nice touch.  Now this is just stupid.  (Saturday, 4/13)   Ring ring ring. . . \"Hello, Four Peaks\" \"Hi, will you be showing the Red Sox/Yankees game?\" \"Yes, definitely.\" \"Even though it's being blacked out?\" \"Blacked out?\" \"Yeah, Fox won't be showing the game because the Diamondbacks game is on at the same time.  You're getting an east coast feed?  From NY or Boston?\" \"Feed?\" \"Yeah, you know, you're getting the broadcast from the Fox affiliate in NY or Boston?\" \". . .Um. . .we'll definitely be showing the game. . .\" \"Ok. . .\"   Drive to Four Peaks \"Hello! Welcome to Four Peaks!  Table for 2?\" \"Yeah, somewhere we can see the Sox/Yankees game.\" \"Oh sorry, it's being blacked out\" \"What?!  But I called 15 minutes ago and you said you were showing it!\" \"No sorry, that Diamondbacks game is on at the same time so we're not getting the Sox/Yankees game\" \"THAT'S WHAT I SAID ON THE PHONE AND YOU SAID YOU WERE SHOWING IT!\" \"Oh, well do you know who you talked to?\" \"It wasn't you?!  I don't know!  Some moron who said you'd be showing the game!\"   You're not getting my business if you blatantly lie to me just to get me in the door."}
{"text":"Went to the 8th street location back in Nov, and was very disappointed with the Oatmeal Stout. We come to Four Peaks for the beer. The food is the cherry on top.  There must have been a bad batch the night we went to the 8th street location. Been to this location several times with no problems. This Four Peaks has restored my confidence in there beer. Creamy and rich in flavor. Since we live a little closer to Scottsdale than to Tempe, we will frequent this location went we need our fix for a top notch Stout. I am a big fan of the Blacken Salmon BLT with fries. My go to sandwich. There are now several options if your a vegetarian and want different toppings on the Black Bean Burger. A nice addition."}
{"text":"We called to make Friday night reservations for a party of 16 - they said they didn't take reservations so we decided to go anyway and drink beer until we could get seated.  To our most pleasant surprise, they pulled together some tables upstairs and we were seated right away.  Our waitperson was very patient and helpful as we all tried to decide what to eat and what beer to drink.  Service was excellent!  Food was excellent!  The beer was excellent as well - thanks Four Peaks for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is always busy. Great beer and the Italian beer bread sandwich is awesome! (without mayo)  I've always had good service here too."}
{"text":"The Husband and I went to Four Peaks for a lunch date since it's close to my job.  I didn't know what to expect since it was super western looking. The menu is average bar food with sandwiches, pizzas and salads. I ordered the pizza and the Husband ordered the kale salad with bacon and chicken. For an appetizer we ordered the lettuce chicken wraps. Those were tasty, but pretty damn spicy!...the pizza was really good and he loved his salad. Salads are nice and big, he couldn't believe he couldn't finish it, but he was mostly full from the appetizer. I also had pizza leftover, so we had an easy dinner :) definitely will be back for a good, low key lunch!"}
{"text":"I had the taproom sandwich. The first half of the sandwich was good. The second half wasn't edible! It was so tough I couldn't cut it with my knife! I told the waiter and they took $2 and some change off my bill. It was half my sandwich! I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some beers and food. Staying at the Marriott down the street. Service was excellent. Beers are great. Food was awesome. Definitely coming back!!! The server was so helpful. Very knowledgeable about the beers and made great recommendations."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always good. Love the spinach dip and the pizza. Great service. I usually sit at the bar. I like the patio area as well. Definitely try this place! Kyla is the best server.  Ask for her and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed the beer sampler with our lunch. This is an excellent way to try the eight core brews, and our server was kind enough to bring us smaller tastes of a few seasonal brews, as well. I loved the peach ale, and my husband really liked the Kiltifter.  His burger was cooked to perfection, and the green chile chicken mac and cheese was a nice, updated take on my favorite comfort food. The beer suggestions on the menu were spot on. The 8th Street was delicious with my meal. Try the Stoutamisu for dessert! There are no words...just try it!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Four Peaks since I just moved to Phoenix with my husband in February. We came down for lunch on a Saturday and had a pretty good time.  It felt a little bit more like a sports bar to my liking but the beer and the food were spot on. I ordered the fish and chips and was not disappointed. The fish was nicely seasoned and the batter was flaky and golden brown. Fries were perfectly salted and crispy. I tried the Oatmeal stout on nitro and was happy with my decision.   If Four Peaks keeps making delicious beer I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great food and great beer. My only complaint is that there isn't a location closer to my house! Keep expanding in the valley!!!"}
{"text":"We were keeping our eyes open for a good place to grab a beer on tap & a good burger, when we spotted Four Peaks Grill & Tap.  We recognized the name as a place we had heard of before and wanted to try.  Our server was Lea and she couldn't have been better.  We ordered the Bleu Light Special Burger & a Kilt Lifter (as recommended by our server after asking us our preferences in a brew).  We couldn't have been more pleased!  The brew was exactly what we were looking for and the burger was heavenly!!  Lea was perfect!  There as soon as we were ready to order, back just enough times that we felt well cared for and not bugged and quick to pull plates out of our way and deliver my to go box (so I can enjoy it again for lunch tomorrow).  We will definitely be back!!  When my brother visits from Washington state this Winter, we will be bringing him to Four Peaks.  He prides himself as a bit of a beer connoisseur, and travels the country looking for choice brews.  We can't wait to show him Four Peaks, because we know he will be enjoy it."}
{"text":"The staff is absolutely great. My bro spilled his beer all over his crotch and three employees rushed over to his aid. Man I was so impressed they are eagles and see everything. Good brew their stuff works. And hey they got good casadillas"}
{"text":"I know you'll come here for the beer, but I have been to this joint twice with Wifey, and the food is REALLY good! We've had salads, wings, a burger, and appetizers, all items have been very tasty and fresh. If you happen to be up near Pima, Frank Lloyd Wright, and N. Scottsdale, give this place a try for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"If you like the Tempe brewpub, this NoSco \"grill and tap\" is very similar. To start, all the yummy Four Peaks brews are the same (can't you just picture the Four Peaks mobile trekking keg after keg up the 101?), and the excellent pub grub on the menu is identical to the Tempe location. Being an ASU alum, I frequented the Tempe location, and it was one of the most unique and fun bars near campus. The atmosphere in Scottsdale is similar, despite being in one of the north side's more complicated and ginormous strip centers. They've clearly taken a design tip from the Tempe spot, with brick walls, similar lighting and bar and a decent-sized patio out front (not nearly the size of Tempe's, but oh well). I like that there's a loft-like second story to the Scottsdale location, but it's not nearly as bustling upstairs for some reason. If you're in Scottsdale, stop in, order a Kiltlifter and get the reuben sandwich or one of the big juicy burgers."}
{"text":"Nice and hardworking staff! Food is always great quality and of course THE BEER! Peach Ale is my fave, light and fruity. My favorite casual restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"First place I came to when I moved to Arizona. Amber is an amazing bartender. Fast and friendly. Food was also amazing. The fried green tomatoes were better than those I had at creole place back home. Will be back, especially for happy hour!  Update: I have come back many times. I've taken home a growler. I'm addicted to the sunbru. Tito is also an amazing bartender. He has a great personality. Plus, he even gave me tips on where to find authentic Asian food. I know I can trust him because he's Asian lol."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Four Peaks in North Scottsdale to get some of the best wings in the valley. Seriously delicious. We usually have outstanding experiences here; however, this time it was drastically different. In short, our server forgot about us. I get that it was pretty busy and they may have been short staffed, but a simple acknowledgement or heads up that the kitchen is backed up would have ameliorated much of this complaint. We had to wait for our beers, water (after being reminded), our food (that the manager ended up taking our order bc our server had neglected to return to the table after 25 minutes), as well as having to flag down another server to order a second round of drinks. Had the wings not been delicious and the French Dip fairly scrumptious (slightly cold)... We would have made a complaint there. I just didn't want to ask for anything to be done because it likely would have been more of a burden on us. I will likely visit again bc this is an anomaly and the wings are amazing... but I hope we have better service next time."}
{"text":"Very interesting menu, was there with several other people and they were regulars. They always enjoyed the food , and loved the beers. The sandwich I order was very tasty . Every one else's plates looked good so I sampled. They were all surprisingly good. The beer selection here is amazing.  So... If you are up for some good brews and food here is your place."}
{"text":"A packed restaurant in the middle of the afternoon, now I know why. they have great food, good prices and beer that doesn't give you a headache. The wait staff was very nice, attentive, young girls with new breast enhancement (why don't they wait until they're older and have a few kids first? If you young ladies are reading and want to know the reality... You have to pay $10 grand to have them redone in 7-10 years and they take the breast tissue that adheres to the implant with it.)  You cant see the kitchen, I tried to peak around the corner to see how clean the floor was and the kitchen looked small so I hope it was clean. (didn't see them on dirty dining.)  Fish and chips is great, calamari is as good as a coastal restaurant, and the black bean and SWestern rolls were very well made with a nice light dipping sauce.  Out running errands, stop in for the food and beer."}
{"text":"Four peaks tries to do it all but falls short.. Very short.. The service is okay I kept asking the girls questions and I felt like she was confused on some of them.. The menu is cool but it's huge and they don't take it away from you when you're done well I think they don't because she didn't take it away from us. This place is popular because of the beer they have which is understandable but do you really think when a group of friends go out they all want beer?? So they have hard liquor but no option.. With it being in Scottsdale you would think they would have some more liquor options. They have the cheapest vodka and no cognacs.. You serious?? Do they really think everyone is a beer drinker when they going to dinner.. The happy hour menu is terrible. And this place has no dishes where you don't have to stuff a burger in your mouth or some short of sandwich. In my opinion this place needs a make over on the menu and liquor options. The food taste good just doesn't have options."}
{"text":"I love BLTs and I love Four Peaks twist on the original and using blackened/grilled salmon in addition to LTO and bacon and using some pesto mayo instead of just regular mayo (which is super gross of course), and of course, it always goes great with a 4Peaks beer! I love the 8th street ale and I love the giant menu...a shout out to the chef too (he is great at what he does!)  Good service, good food, awesome beer, and the company that goes along with all of the above certainly doesn't suck :)"}
{"text":"Great beer and food but lost service. I have been standing at the bare looking directly at both bartenders and after 15 minutes no service. Before someone criticizes they are not that busy for a Friday at 6:25. What a joke"}
{"text":"Great microbrews. Descent service. No way burgers are 1/2 pound. Bacon was burnt. Calimari appetiser was delicious. Burger came out overcooked. The guy who brought replacement had attitude problem."}
{"text":"You can't ever go wrong with the classic Arizona's Four Peaks drinks. This brewery is located in the north scottsdale location. It has an upstairs and a small patio.   We came here with a group of friends to watch some Sunday football and they had all the essential games on the TVs.   We ordered a pitcher of kilt lifter for $16 (happy hour $12) and the 5 layer nacho dip with blacken chicken (extra for the chicken). The service was really attentive and the servers were really nice. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came in on a late Thursday night NIKKI was our waitress. She is amazing. I definitely recommend this brew pub. She recommended the BBQ pizza it was really good. Their BBQ sauce is to die for & a peach ale. The peach ale is light and crisp with a bit of vanilla twist."}
{"text":"Very good food all the time, wait staff is excellent.  THE BEER is tasty but way to WARM.  To me this is a big draw back.  The glasses are not that cold to off-set the warm beer."}
{"text":"Have not returned in awhile, but things were pretty tasty. The highlight was the $5 pours of pumpkin porter. The food was good as well and I did not even realize they have an upstairs dining room and bar. I tried the beer bread and had enough for two meals. This burrito type thing was loaded with grilled chicken, mozzarella cheese and an array of veggies including artichokes. The beer battered fries were a good twist on the traditional spuds as well."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is AMAZING here! Nice selection of beer, duh! The only think I can complain about is my server last time took a while to warm up to us. It was weird."}
{"text":"Simple and short - cant beat a place that brews its own beer.  The Scottsdale location is great, usually really quiet with good service, and they have pretty good food for a bar.  Fish and chips are surprisingly really good, so are the chicken fingers (I'm sorry I like late night finger food)  Their beers are great with a great selecion, from chocolates to very hoppy to wheaty to heffs to the oh so yummy AZ peach.  Also, you can take home big jugs with fresh tap beer if you want for a pretty good price, always good if you're lookin to continue your good time at home"}
{"text":"My business partner and I had lunch at the Tempe location yesterday and were helped by Courtney at the bar. She was very friendly and provided great service!! They are lucky to have her. We will definitely come back with service like that."}
{"text":"Four Peaks seems to be Phoenix's most omnipresent local beer--I saw its brews on quite a few menus while we were in town and figured it was Phoenix's equivalent to L.A.'s Golden Road. We had an hour to kill before heading to the airport on the Sunday of our trip, and found ourselves close enough to Four Peaks Grill & Tap that we decided to check it out.  I wasn't in love with the place. It was a sports bar in a giant ugly strip mall next to a Party City. There were a lot of people there to watch football on a Sunday afternoon, so it was a bit loud, and otherwise pretty bland. We sat on an enclosed patio next to a draped tarp that dripped water. Service was good, though, and we did enjoy ourselves.  We had a round of beers and an order of Bavarian pretzels, a solid mid-afternoon snack. We had the Hop Knot IPA and the 8th Street Pale Ale, and I remember liking one and not the other, but not which was which. (Feel free to mash the Useful button right there.) The pretzels were great--big, soft, and chewy, studded with salt. They came with a spicy mustard sauce and an optional chile cheese dip. Don't skip on that cheese--it was delicious.  I didn't like this place enough to come back on another vacation, but the beer and pretzels were tasty, and our time was better spent here than it would've been at the airport. I wouldn't recommend this bar unless you're a local or a major sports fan on a game day, but I'll definitely keep drinking Four Peaks beer when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Four Peaks Brewery never fails to bring back fond memories of many many things.. Old friends, early 20's, scandalous bathroom \"breaks\", the \"patio of illegal behavior\", exes, birthday celebrations, drunken debauchery, peeing my pants.... among many other things. It's always the same too, so for a place that brings pleasant reminiscent thoughts and consistency, who can complain? Great menu options, I'd say its your typical above average bar type cuisine, but none of it has ever been crap. I would be the first to list a list of crap if needed. On top of that they have Kiltlifer, so seriously, what is better? To put the whipped cream on top of all of these wonderful things, I swear the only other person in Phoenix who has ever lived in (or even visited) Cape Cod works here.. makes for good conversation about things Phoenicians could give a shit less about. Like sailboats, sea glass and lobstahs.   Perfection comes in all shapes and sizes, and luckily, Four Peaks is one of them for me. No complaints here, I have and always will love Four Peaks."}
{"text":"I know this is going to be super girly but I love the peach beer at Four Peaks and the beer battered fries are amazing."}
{"text":"This is a great bar/grill to come after work or hang on the weekends. This location is close to so much shopping that its nice to take a break and grab a cold beer here and relax on the patio. The food is top notch for bar food. I love the batter they use for their fries and fish. The bread also has their unique touch which I love. I recently tried their veggie/garden burger which had roasted red peppers and and mushrooms.. very tasty!"}
{"text":"Another great visit, bartender was super cool and very helpful. Informing me of the daily specials, happy hour deals and half orders. From 10pm-late great happy hour on premium liquids, $3 for ketel, makers etc... Had the beef stew and a half order of the pretzels. The stew was okay, more like a soup (Thin slices of sandwich style beef, sparse veggies). The pretzel was perfect (warm and doughy, not overdone, nice large to med size) and a steal for a half order, def don't need to gorge on two.   Always its about the their beers, tried the seasonal which was a Mexican chocolate brew. Liked it a lot, lotta bold flavors but not too filling as dark beers tend to be. Had to have the hefe with the pretzel, still say the kilt lifter is my fav."}
{"text":"the absolute best cheese dip i have ever had....yummy yummy yummy must be their own brew that makes the difference......this is tucked away but parking was easy for me and loved all the brews i had and all the food......highly recommend...."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times now and the service has always been great. They are quick and attentive. A server gave me a recommendation that was absolutely amazing. I had the blackened salmon BLT, and now that's what I get every time. The chicken strips are also outstanding. The chipotle ranch that comes with them is the perfect dipping sauce for me. I have also had great beer recommendations here as well, and I always love sitting out on the patio."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. We usually go to Tempe four peaks . We love their green chili   Potato things ... but the one is Scottsdale was horrible, I actually returned the food back . I don't do that unless it's just terrible. It was sooooo salty. After that ordered French dip sandwich, aau just was too salty again . I didn't use aau jus at all. I was really not satisfied with their food . Please do quality check on your food."}
{"text":"The food and beer is awesome every time I go. The chefs care about what going out!!Make sure you try the chefs specials!!! Thanks and see you soon!"}
{"text":"Four Peaks use to be our Go to place. We loved the staff and the owner. We stopped in today and sat with no service. 5 waitresses standing at the front door bickering. When we finally got up to leave they said,  Thanks have a nice day. What do you say... your service is horrible. This once was a great place and has fallen. The restaurant is dirty and run down, I am sure the wait staff would rather bicker than clean. If you go, good luck on the service."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They have awesome food.  My favorite is their Salmon BLT.  Fantastic.  We went on a Saturday night with a party of 10.  They were slammed and still managed to get us a table in 15 minutes.  Service is awesome and of course their beer. :)"}
{"text":"We went to Four Peaks for a late dinner with friends. We are all big fans of their brews so that was the main appeal. They didn't have a ton of vegetarian options but my husband and I split the portabella veggie beer bread. I wasn't super impressed but again, we were primarily there for the beer. Nothing goes down like a peach ale on a hot Arizona night :)"}
{"text":"Much love for Four peaks !! every time I'm in the area, I find a reason to stop here, Great beer selection and great food!!! never had a bad experience here !! all around a stand up Tap house!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I went to Four Peaks to watch some football (unfortunately our teams are not local and aren't shown on normal channels). Four Peaks has a decent number of TV's, a good amount of seating, good beer of course, and a large menu with enough variety for everyone. The place was packed with people who were there to just eat lunch, which is a good sign for a brewpub. The service was okay...our waitress seemed pretty dumb as in it took 30 minutes and 3 reminders to get a cup of coffee and then for the next 3 hours she stopped by every 5ish minutes to ask if we were doing okay while we were talking to each other or staring intently at our game (too often of an interruption...it was annoying). We ate:   - Nachos: Whoa I've never gotten nachos from a bar with so much cheese! They definitely don't skip - there had to be 1/4 inch of cheese covering each chip (yum). I didn't really like that the nacho toppings were served separately on the side which meant a lot of dipping & paying attention to the food instead of the game.  - Garden burger: I love that they have real veggie burgers but mine was very soggy & undercooked. The bun it came on was amazing, super thick and bready and delicious. The creamy sauce, cheese, & toppings were heavy but perfect for drinking food.  - French Dip Sandwich: My boyfriend got this and thought it was fine but nothing too special.  - Beer Battered Fries: Yum. I was hoping they would a little more battered & thick, but instead it was a very light crunchiness on the outside of the fry. Still a very grubbing snack.   I'm sure we'll be going back to Four Peaks for more football games. It also would be a good place to bring a visiting friend from out of town so they can sample some good local beer."}
{"text":"My server messed up my order as i asked not to add a feta cheese in my lamb burger but over all it was a nice evening. Atmosphere inside was great. Server was nice."}
{"text":"Probably the most consistent restaurant that serves \"bar\" food. The food is pretty much always consistent and my personal favorite are the grilled chicken wings (you have to ask for them grilled). If you are looking for some fried food the calamari, chicken strips, or fish are tough to beat. Lastly, the carne adovada is pretty solid for not being a mexican restaurant. I like it served in the quesadilla."}
{"text":"I love the fall season at Four Peaks. There is nothing better than pumpkin porter to get you into early holiday spirits. I admit, during October, I like to take home a little white pumpkin or two ;) The food is ok here, not my favorite. I go here for the atmosphere, drinking with friends, and some local brews. I have had so much fun here, never a dull visit. Thanks for putting up with me and my crazy friends!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for happy hour after a long day at work. Great atmosphere, beer and their chicken rolls are so yummy!"}
{"text":"Great beer and better food.  Upscale bar food.  Great wings and Philly steak .. And enjoyed a 8  4oz beer tasting flight.  ... Don't confuse it for 2 peaks around the corner ( a modern day hooters)"}
{"text":"We came for brunch: chicken fried steak and enchiladas were good. Waitress was great. TVs were so loud that it ruined the dining experience.  We will return but not on Sunday."}
{"text":"Four Peaks from service to quality of food was top notch. We ordered some Apps - the pretzel and meatball: they were perfection just large enough for four people to share and not fill up before the meal! The timing was perfect between the dishes, none of us felt that we needed to rush and finish the appetizers before our entrees arrived. The entrees were suburb!! One of the best Crispy Chicken sandwiches I have had that did not come from a drive thru. My boyfriend had the Turkey Club pictured which was better than expecting they did not skimp on the the turkey like most places do!  If you have a chance come here for lunch or dinner your stomach will thank you later"}
{"text":"First time at 4 peaks.and was impressed. Food was good and beer was great. Will go again if the opportunity arise"}
{"text":"Good food served hot. Chicken fingers meaty and tasty. Good beer selection too! One of my favorite spots for reliable food and friendly service."}
{"text":"We used to live right by the Tempe location and were spoiled by our proximity to great food and beer.  Now that we live out of state, Four Peaks is but a happy dream.....until this past weekend, when we found ourselves back in the PHX for work reasons.  Got a great deal on a hotel near the Scottsdale 4Peaks and dropped by to indulge ourselves for old times' sake.  The food and service are consistently good and the atmosphere is always fun.  Our dinner that night consisted of the Hopknot IPA ($4.50 I think), soup and sandwich combo (Santa Fe chicken soup and roast beef sandwich, $7) and Garden burger ($9).  All were fabulous.  The soup was nice and spicy and the burger was delightfully moist and juicy, just like a \"real\" burger.  :)    We raise a glass to ya, Four Peaks.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Four Peaks for years. They have always provided that neighborhood feel bar that is all to often lost these days. The Hop Knot is my tap special. I couldn't believe my eyes when I stopped in for a brew and a bite and noticed a change in their menu. They always run a daily special but I don't remember them ever changing the menu. I ventured outside my comfort zone and went for \"The New Yorker\". Pastrami is right up my alley. I guess the reason they haven't changed the menu in years is because they spent some time perfecting some items. This pastrami sandwich was better than the one I had at the Carnegie Deli. Marble Rye, Pastrami,cole slaw and mustard. Get me another beer please! Looking forward to coming back to try the other additions on the menu."}
{"text":"Been here several times, but made the stop specifically for a Pumpkin Porter.  In this grossly oversaturated pumpkin flavor time of the year it is the only pumpkin item I like. So good.  Had some wings and green chile poutine to eat. Wings are good size and flavorful and the poutine was interesting.  In a mostly good way.  I don't care for their fries, because they are never cooked enough and when you pour a green chile over the top they get soggy real quick.  That being said, it' still a pretty good snack.  A lot of TV's for sports and easy going crowd. Staff is great, friendly.  Definitely a place to keep going back to.  Get some of that Pumpkin Porter to take home as it will be go before you know it."}
{"text":"What a great place to finish a day. Though parking van be challenging, it's a nice warehouse converted to a brewery with some of the tastiest fermented beverages on tap.   One of my favorite places I liked to go in my past was Pyramid in Berkeley, CA. The open area makes for a comfortable place you can come to relax.   The food was great and happy hour makes it a steal. Try their beers on tap and you won't feel like a stranger.   In fact for this weary traveler, it felt like a place close to home.   Points for amazing food (battered fries), staff (friendly) and brew. Park in the back ally."}
{"text":"If u want to escape the douchbagness of old town this is the perfect place!!   Im more of a wine kind of gal, but I fell in love with the peach ale and now thats my friday celebratory drink.   The service is fantastic, the food is really good and the ambience is very lay back, relax, enjoy your beer kind of place!!"}
{"text":"Exactly the same as the Tempe location but you can swap the annoying students for pricks from north Scottsdale.  The food and beer remain tasty."}
{"text":"I actually prefer this location to the one in Tempe. Okay, so I'm a little biased because it's closer to my house, but proximity aside, the place has a great vibe and the service here is top-notch. This location is in the Frank Lloyd Wright and the 101 parking lot and it faces Hayden. Parking can be a bitch here.  Do yourself a favor and order the fish and chips. The icelandic cod is battered in their Kilt Lifter and the fries are perfectly crispy. I have yet to finish a whole order of this monster, so definitely a split-able item.   Happy hour runs 3-7 pm and 10-close. $1 off pints, which brings the cost to $3.25.  $12 for a pitcher. The Kilt Lifter Scottish Ale and Oatmeal Stout are my current favorites. No happy hour deals for seasonal beers, but don't let that steer you away from the delicious Pumpkin Porter (only offered in the fall)."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, inexpensive and such efficient, friendly staff!! We had my son's rehearsal dinner at this location. They have a loft area we fit our group of 30 in. Nice relaxed atmosphere and we could wander around, talk and meet new family members.   They worked up a menu for our group to allow each person to order what they wanted and allow the kitchen to be efficient.   Everyone raved about the chili mac and cheese and fish and chips. The poutine was good and so were the burgers.   Just an all around wonderful experience, I would recommend it for any party."}
{"text":"We stopped by since it was the one of the only places open when we arrived in Scottsdale for out vacation. The food and service were superb! We both were delighted with the coconut soup. We praised the soup to our waitress and she got us each a bowl \"to go\" since it was the end of the night. Also, we loved the stout shake and stout tiramisu. Make sure you order dessert! The staff were all very friendly and were constantly checking on our group. When one of the waitresses found out that we were on vacation, she pulled up a chair and gave us a list of places we shouldn't miss for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We definitely plan on a return visit this week. Oh and of course their beer is great too!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the peach beer here and the food is great. My only complaint is how loud it gets, you can barely hear the person right next to you."}
{"text":"Returned for another visit with the family. Another great trip. Tried the Carne Adovada, cleaned my plate. My Wife had the Italian Beef, she loved it. She also tried the sweet jalapeno ranch(as suggested by the waitress Jess) sooooo tastey!!. When my one kids grilled cheese came out I almost stole it, it was looking so good. We had an amazing time. The Waitress was fantastic, full of energy and very helpful.  I think we have a favorite place to eat in Scottsdale!! We will just work our way through the menu.   Thanks for another great experience."}
{"text":"We go there for the peach ale. I also enjoy their pale ales and ipa s.  We usually order green chili pork poutine which is delicious if you are not dieting.  They have a nice outdoor patio"}
{"text":"You know what? I love this place! Love the pretzels, hamburgers, and wings... I am sure there is more... But, these are the things I like!  I also love the bartender\"esses\" introduce themselves and are personable. We bought and rented a keg and (all that  goes with) from them one Super Bowl! It was a great experience. I must admit today there is a very annoying aspect of this bar! I do understand the busy lunch crowd, but today, because I was a lone, I sat at the bar, and two really sweaty guys came stacking glasses... Several times! Loud, sweaty (which in some settings seems dirty!) mostly loud and annoying! I just wanted to come have a pretzel and a beer to prepare for the second half of my day... Maybe I was already stressed and it made it worse... But, please!!!!  Can't it seem effortless and maybe enjoyable??? I know it's lunch and fast paced and I appreciate it, but the clanking of the glasses got my attention and then the sweatiness turned my stomach! Maybe this is just one area Four Peaks on Hayden Road in Scottsdale could improve! I know the guy was exceptionally proud of himself to get so much accomplished...  But at what expense? Okay said my peace... Why doesn't it make me feel  better?"}
{"text":"Beer is fantastic, food is great especially if you enjoy spicy flavors, everything is so fresh. Best part the service is amazing, everyone was so friendly and FAST! Amazing happy hour specials for food and drinks, goes until 6pm which is really nice!"}
{"text":"Awesome bar staff, great space overall for a group gathering or just a date with a cupla friends. The kitchen was SUPER COOL to me on the day we visited (1/11/15) as they subbed the two fried eggs with scrambled egg whites for me on my brunch order (since the kitch was actually post-brunch crowd.) YAAAAY for feeling special and WOW for feeling so full that half my lunch was taken away for lunch the next day! Great flavors on that plate.....I gotta learn how to make beans like that....and enchiladas like that.....and crispy potatoes like that.....everything, really ;)"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last month. The first time, we had Vanessa. She was perfect! Tried their wings for the first time, and they were on point. This last time, we had Tito at the bar. Once again, I had the wings, a Sunbru, and a Rose Kentucky Burboun. So. Good. Their knowledge of the beers and food is great. Tito noticed I was leaning more towards whiskeys, and offered up quite a few suggestions for me. Good service, good happy hour, and good food. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I could eat and drink at Four Peaks every day, and have found myself on stretches where I have....  The food is consistently excellent, and the daily specials list is always interesting and offers a ton of variety.  The beers are great, too!  The Oatmeal Stout makes a mighty fine car bomb, and the 8th Street Ale is a classic.  On more than one occasion, I have found myself in Four Peaks for Sunday brunch to soak up the very same hangover that they caused!  You can't ask for much more.  Service is always good, and a great atmosphere.  I can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"Four Peaks brews are well knows in Phoenix. I like the fact that they have a big restaurant where you can dine and enjoy all of their craft brews. I would say that as at as brewery food goes they are a 3 star for me. Very typical, nothing special. But I love the location, the beer, and the service is great.   Recently I came here and tried the Green Chile Pork Poutine: Fries, Green Chile Pork, and White Cheddar Curds. Something you would for come up with and totally devour when you were drunk. Decent but nothing special as I said. I also had the BBQ Chicken Pizza: Chicken, Onion, Cilantro, and Mozzarella. The Pizza was pretty good. The crust was surprisingly very good. BBQ was sweet and tangy. Chicken was tender and there was more than enough to go around. I like this place for what it is and I will continue to come and enjoy craft beers and pub food."}
{"text":"What to do when your computer crashes and you have an early work day?? Umm... You convince the girls to go to early happy hour!   I really like Four Peaks! The service is always great and the beer selection they have is great! I love how they have seasonal beers, like the Pumpkin Porter and Double Pumpkin Porter -- both great choices. They also had an Apple Pie flavored bottled beer (I know, go to a bar with beer on tap and drink bottled beer...) but it was mouthwateringly delicious! Total liquid dessert. Amazing!   The food is good too -- nothing out of the ordinary, but good nonetheless. I had just a regular burger with Cajun fries on the side, and it made me happy, although I would've loved some tater tots instead (Our waiter actually pointed out that he suggested they add tots to the menu as he keeps getting requests, but he said in the 5 years he's been there, the kitchen/management hasn't listened... perhaps you should listen?! Just sayin'...)  Overall it's a great hangout spot, good atmosphere, tasty beer, pretty good food, and great service."}
{"text":"I love this place! The Peach Ale is my favorite beer in the world. Food is good and its a really good place to watch Sunday Football."}
{"text":"Typical - a good glass of beer and so-so food.  Also typical - the noise level - high."}
{"text":"Service is clutch! Always stop in here when in town. We love the beer and the food.   But, I have to write a review now because of the most recent time we visited.   We stopped by Four Peaks for dinner and beer after being at a spring training game. I wish I would have gotten the name of our server because she was incredible. She noticed we had come from the game and that we were finishing our waters really quickly (it was a warm day and we had been drinking beer all afternoon). It was super busy, as it always is, and she made us feel like she cared about us, like we were her only table. When we were leaving she said \"I noticed you guys drank a lot of water, would you like a cup of water to go?\" This server was incredible. So attentive. Every time we've come in here we've had great service, but this particular time was extremely memorable.  Thanks Four Peaks for always serving consistently good food and having delicious beer."}
{"text":"Always a good time when we go here, Love the sunbru and the tap room tenderloin. Make sure you get it with the beer bread and the beer battered fries. Yum my mouth is watering just thinking about it, Ive actually have never eatten anything i didnt like here."}
{"text":"I have been to 4 Peaks several times. Each visit has been a pleasant experience. As a casual microbrewery 4 Peaks does a good job. The handcrafted beers that I have tried are all very good. My personal favorite is the Kilt Lifter, an amber ale, similar to a Fat Tire but not nearly as sweet.    This Friday I met some colleagues at the 4 Peaks in North Scottsdale. A friend and I decided to split the 16\" barbecue chicken pizza. This size was just right for 2 people. We both started out very hungry and still had two slices left over.  I would rate the quality of the pizza below dedicated pizza joints like Bianco, Grimaldi's and Humble Pie, but above places like Peter Piper, Zipps, etc... It was about on par with something you would get from Papa Johns or Dominos, which is just fine in my book if accompanied by a really good cold beer.   The place was full and had a lively atmosphere. The only thing missing was a good college football game. With that in mind, next time I will go on a Saturday. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Food: really good. So far, I've had the BBQ Chicken pizza (excellent), chicken enchiladas (so-so) and the chef salad with sweet jalapeño dressing (outstanding).  Beer: I come here for KiltLifter. Always good.  Service: If I ran a brewery or bar, I'd hire Tito. This guy is what you want in a bartender. Being new to the area, he's been extremely welcoming, gracious and that's enough to bring me back in. Went to OHSO next door and left after one beer, I left because Tito set a standard. Comes down to service and the guy delivers.   Sit at the bar if you can . Best seat in the house."}
{"text":"God. Great food ( get a beer bread sandwich or steak sandwich) but you can't go wrong with anything. The beer is so good. I love hop knot"}
{"text":"Great Food, not my favorite beer, and definitely wanted better atmosphere!   The food was too notch! Bar food - style menu with a few more classy dishes thrown in. From the clientele while we were there, this is more like a family restaurant than a brewery.   The beer for 4 Peaks was not my favorite. I believe it's a matter of preference, but after a few tasting glasses from the waitress, my dad and I were hard pressed to land on one that was \"better than ok\"  This particular location is in a strip mall near the Walmart... Not much atmosphere for a special night out."}
{"text":"This place rocks there Raj IPA is pretty amazing as well as there food one of my favorites off the menu is there Bleu cheese bacon burger this location is also a lot more laid back than the Tempe location which is a good thing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place!!! We like all the food but the shrimp and goat cheese bruschetta is amazing and so is the pesto veggie pizza!!! The pumpkin porter, sunbru or hefe beers! Definitely worth a visit"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:  We came here on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The food was just okay and not very memorable.  There really isn't a Happy Hour menu at Four Peaks.  As it was explained to us, \"the drinks are $1.00 off and the food is just the regular prices.\"     This is the sort of thing you run into at Craft Brewers that serves food.  A lot of times they confuse their beer sales, as proof of their food success.  It's too bad they don't eat here.  AMBIANCE/MOOD: Very, very noisy and somewhat overly attentive service, particularily from those busing tables.  MENU: Everything under the sun, but nothing that stands out: Chicken Rolls $7; Spinach Artichoke Dip $8; Garlic Cheese Beer Bread $6; Cheese Puffs $7; Spanekopita $7; Wings $7; Nachos $7; Quesadilla $7; Thai Hummus $6; Stuffed Poblano $8; Chicken Strips & Fries $8; Pub Fish and Chips $9; Chicken Enchiladas $9; Carne Adovada $10 and various pizzas starting at $13.50  SERVICE: As noted above, they are overly attentive, including their over the top busers. They seem to excel at taking your plates before you have finished your food. LOL.  No, it's actually not funny.  FOOD: Four Peaks is a Craft/ Micro brewer http://www.craftbeer.com/breweries/brewery-locator/find-a-us-brewery  who uses the restaurant to sell their beer.  Now, normally that isn't a bad thing. Except the food here is uninspiring at best.  RAM, Rock Bottom, Yard House, Gordon Biersch, BJs all do it quite well, but these are restaurants concepts trying to sell food and beer, in that order.  We tried their  Spanekopita, which they describe as a blend of cheeses, spinach, pine nuts, and dill rolled in phyllo dough and served with marinara sauce. We actually liked this very much and would recommend it.    On the other hand, their Five Layer Nachos was a big miss. It came out cold and you could peal the cheese off the nacho chips. We added chicken ($2.50) which looked like it came out of a Sysco bag and dropped on top before serving. Ugh.  As you would expect, the beer at Four Peaks is very much Four Stars.  We enjoyed their Oatmeal Stout and their 8th Street Scottish Ale, both of which had low IBUs and 4.8-5.2% alcohol.    PRICES: Expect to pay around $40 including tax and tip, depending on how many pints you are going to enjoy."}
{"text":"We were in town on Friday and had a large party upstairs. I have to thank all the staff for being absolutely fabulous!!! The food was great as usual and everything went extremely well!! The only recommendation I have is they popped the keg for the Pumpkin Porter that night and it didn't taste the same. It lacked its normal pumpkin robust flavor.  Otherwise as always Four Peaks has exceeded our expectations again, thank you!! I highly recommend them for dinner, a quick drink by yourself or with friends, or a large gathering."}
{"text":"This place NEVER lets me down! Hands down the best brewery I've gone too! Doesn't matter if it's Tempe or the Scottsdale location the food is amazing as well as the service.  My boyfriend and I went in the other night at 11:30pm and were greeted right away.  He tried the wood chuck blueberry cider which he let me try, it was crisp and refreshing! So good!   We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip which was delicious and I love the variety of chips and pita bread. The dip to chip/pita ratio was perfect! I always hate when I get more chips than dip! It dip was creamy and the pita bread was soft and warm.   We also got the modern pizza, it had arugula and prosciutto on it. I enjoyed it! It's a tad salty but it wasn't heavy eating it and it feeds two perfectly!   I always enjoy coming here, the quality is incomparable and I've been to more than my fair share of breweries!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a happy hour beer and a bite to eat, I had the pumpkin porter and the swiss mushroom burger with fries.  The beer was great and the burger was good, was hoping for a sweet potato fry option as that would have put it over the top, but that was not to be.  A great atmosphere on the patio (heaters included), the parking lot can be a bit of a deathmatch for an open space.  Be ready to duel! (or walk a bit farther)."}
{"text":"Came in here last night to get some food.  I tried the cream of mushroom soup.  Which was so good, but so so rich it filled me up pretty good.  I was so full I didn't really eat much of my dinner.  I got a half size Caesar salad, which was still big with blackened salmon on it.  It was so good.  I was just a little disappointed I got so full so fast off the soup, I wanted to eat more of my salad.  And I love the white ale, my favorite beer!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer, food, and ambience! We went just before the kitchen closed and ordered a pretzel and the hummus. Both were fantastic! And we got a couple of stouts and imperial ales. Both were terrific! If you like excellent beer, food, and a chilled out vibe, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Add me to the list of people that love the Tempe location... and like this Scottsdale location. The constant for both are really good burgers, fries and beer selection for reasonable prices. The downsides for this location are the (frequently full) parking and limited size (waits when crowded). If they relocated nearby to a larger location with better parking, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Came here for a Friday night dinner....not really into beer so I ordered a vodka soda, it was o.k., I had better but hey, I'm in a brewery.   Appetizers ordered was the spinach dip, OMG, get it! I don't know how they made it and I don't care, my mouth just wanted more!! It came with tortilla chips and pita slices, it was soo goooood!   For dinner, I wanted a burger. I ordered the brie hamburger and it was amazing, HUGE, only could eat half of it. In my head I knew I should skip out on the fries so I got their house salad which was really good.  Atmosphere is pretty cool. For me, I'm one and done, I tried it once and I'm good!"}
{"text":"If it weren't for the beer here, this place would just be another sports bar type of place. Just cover the floor with sawdust and it'd be set. They've got a great selection of beer and that's it and that's all. The food here ranges from \"meh\" to \"wtf were they thinking? Chipotle hummus? Maybe after that they can work on salmon flavored ice cream for a dessert menu. All jabbing aside, the beers here are all very distinct and cover a pretty good range. Anything from a dark to light as well as a pretty wide range of flavors. The Peach Ale is a favorite of mine and it's not too heavy either. As far as prices go, it's incredibly cheap for what you get. A big glass of beer for a small note always equal a good time."}
{"text":"Cassidy and Tito and Erica are the best!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great beer, fun atmosphere, and good food as well.  They have a good menu with some interesting items that you don't find just anywhere.  My favorite appetizer is the spanakopita... yum!  You can't go wrong with a brewery with good beer that serves good food as well.  Their Kilt Lifter is by far the best I've tried, and they serve up some good seasonals as well.  Looking forward to visiting this place again and again!  Great place to watch the game."}
{"text":"Location is very close to home.  Food and beers are amazing.  Service is is a B+ to an A-.  The location doesnt serve as cold of beer as the Tempe location, but otherwise a solid review is needed from my end.   A glass of RAJ IPA or Kilt-lifter with the 8th Street Ale Chicken Strips are to die for.  Try the Rueban or nachos as well.  Sit back and look at the slide show or some of the photos posted and I bet you will find something you like.   The only thing holding me back from a 5 star is that parking can be a major bummer, and that they always check ID's."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is phenomenal! There is plenty of entertainment, and they have the best server my husband and I have ever experienced anywhere else, EVER! Steffan was amazing! Attentive, friendly, helpful and just an absolute pleasure! Their atmosphere and service will have us coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Every Tuesday night after our late night hockey games, I join a rag tag collection of heroes, misfits and misanthropes at Four Peaks Brewery in North Scottsdale for some post game gab and nosh. I love these nights. We test our aging, yet surprisingly spry bodies mano-a-mano for adult hockey league glory and bond over drinks that no one actually orders because while Karina, our beloved server, may not know our last names, she knows we're predictable.  And speaking of it, I always order a plate of fries, or hope Brad E does. They're fucking delicious. T.A.S.T.Y. Big fan. But on this one lucky night, my boy Jerry W, genius that he is, orders nachos. I think nothing of it, until they arrive. They are GORGEOUS. Seriously beautiful. A culinary specimen clearly dispatched to our table by some immaculately conceived experiment working through the now divine hand of a short order cook. The guy, or lady, is a magician with these nachos. They're like eye-crack. Or better perhaps eye-(censored) as I visually molested each chip and chunk of cheese.  But like all impurities and roadblocks in our beautiful kingdom, like a cancer on the king's nose, these nachos were covered in chicken. I'm not even going to get into that discussion, but I don't do chicken. So I couldn't eat any of what I considered a plate of life-changing nachos, even before they changed my life. And I told myself \"Dally G., no matter what happens tonight, whether it's because you go to the store and get the ingredients or because you go to Filibertos and get their supernachos, you're dumb ass is going to be chowin' down on delightfully tasty nachos this evening.\"  So here's one of the keys to the story. It was a done deal. I already believed with 100% certainty that I would be eating a plate of nachos that evening. Are you with me? A sure thing, no matter what. The universe had no choice but to comply. Emerson said it best, \"The world makes way for a mo fo who knows where he's going.\"  But my friends didn't eat the whole plate. Nacho remnants teased me like those little shorts hot young women wear in the spring. I'm not gonna lie; more inspired to get fat I have never been.  Time passes and my thoughts stagnate (but without any of the negative connotation normally associated with the idea of stagnation). Nachos. Can't let it go...Men quip and pontificate and ask answers and tell questions and borrow my phone to look at (censored) and some hit on Karina but I am of one mind: Nachos.   And a woman's voice rings out! She was three words deep and I knew my life was changed forever. You, dear Yelper, should have chills right now. She said, and I quote, \"Hey, the cook made these by accident. Does anyone want them?\" I knew what they were without turning around but I had to look because my eyes compensate for my imperfect relationship with the universe and I needed to connect the truth in my soul to my physical experience that I call existence, living.  She sat down chickenless nachos right in front of me. They were free. For me. More beautiful than the first plate, they sparkled. CHEESE SPARKLED!  What does this mean? So what? Big deal. Total coincidence, right?  I know in my heart I connected with those nacho-potentialities and made them come to be as the beautiful plate that was placed before me... There's no question in my mind. Not even the faintest hint of doubt. And every day since, I've made small things happen. Am I able to win the lottery? No. I tried. But I didn't BELIEVE believe. I only wished and hoped and did what everyone else does. My skills are weak. It's very different knowing that the money is already mine, compared to knowing I'd have nachos. Winning the lottery is a huge and powerful experience that I'm not prepared for... Everyone asks me to will them their hearts' desires. It doesn't work like that... I don't care if you find your wallet (I do, but not like I need to)... You need to believe that you already have it and it will happen. You can literally have anything you want if it's mutually beneficial to you and the object's relationship to the world.  I know. This sounds like voodoo. Hocus pocus. The Secret. Whatever. It's crazy. I don't know it's true. I just feel it is with every ounce of passion and love and creative energy I've ever experienced... I share this experience primarily because I enjoy being made fun of but if even one person gives it a try and finds power in their life I've done a very good thing. Oh! and to remind everyone Four Peaks is life changing."}
{"text":"Went in after game (Cardinals win over Packers) and quickly met with Bartender (Tito) who introduced us to the house beers and specials on tap.  Whatever Tito or Niki suggest, just do it. Best place to go. Food is good beer is just as good if selection isn't better."}
{"text":"Did not eat (not sure why they would try to put a spin on poutine but they did) but as far as their beers are concerned I definitely recommend it to micro brewery enthusiasts. Had the flight of all 8 mainstays, bartender (Amber, service with a smile) brought me their seasonal sampler complimentary. Liked them all, well crafted beer."}
{"text":"This secondary location of Four Peaks is located in the extreme northern section of Scottsdale in a strip mall directly behind a Chuck-E-Cheese want-to-be. It's a great sports bar. A patio opens into the main seating room via a garage-door-style set of window panes. The layout maximizes the small amount of floor space and there is a TV on absolutely every wall in the place meaning there is nowhere you can't see one - even from the balcony that also features a pool table.   We walked in during a Minnesota Vikings playoff game, which was apparently a mistake, because this is obviously a Vikings bar. The place was packed with purple people eaters sporting Four Peaks/Vikings shirts.  I didn't get a chance to try the food as we left at halftime. But I was very impressed by the assortment of interesting pizza toppings. I definitely would have stacked one up with some spinach, pine nuts, buffalo mozzarella, portabellas, goat cheese, pesto and sun dried tomatoes.   The beers are - of course - the same as the main location. They haven't changed much since I visited last year. The Raj IPA is still the best choice along with a decent stout on nitro and a crowd-pleasing Scottish called a Kilt Lifter. Same scores for beer.  The service was bad that night, but I don't blame them, they were packed and we weren't eating.  Overall, I would come here to watch a game every single time."}
{"text":"LOCAL BREWERY - Never as good as Tempe location but still great!!!  Went last night during Thursday Nigh Football Cards vs. Rams game - place was packed out - standing room only & hour wait. Our friends (regulars) told us the trick is to come around half time and the place starts to clear out - sure enough that was the case.   Lots of big screens to enjoy the game on - and they've got the pumpkin porter rocking right now so you have to swing through if your in the area - not a huge fan of pumpkin anything but THEIR porter is delicious!  Had the Fish-n-chips, which the batter is made in their Kilt Lifter brew - a favorite when drinkinng Scottish ales - 6% ABV"}
{"text":"Always a great time at Four Peaks! Service is always great and the bartenders remember you. Very friendly place to go with good food."}
{"text":"Food was good although I found a food tie in my chicken enchiladas...they did comp. Drinks were nice and strong."}
{"text":"This place is consistently great. Awesome service, great food, delicious beer! We love going before catching a movie at Studio Movie Grill or just to grab dinner and a few drinks! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"You have to love a local brewery and Four Peaks has a great reputation around the valley. The Scottsdale Four Peaks has a different feel than the original Tempe location and obviously attracts a different crowd - older, calmer.  I remember liking the food at Tempe, but that was years ago and since I've started going to this location, I haven't been too impressed with the standard bar fare, but it's a great place to get a local beer. The peach and the Sun Bru are my favorites."}
{"text":"As a new member of the Yelp community I feel compelled to go back in time and review places I have been that I will never forget. I was in town to enjoy the amazing golf that is located in Scottsdale and it was important for my friends and I to find a solid bar that was unlike what we would go to back home. Upon arriving to the hotel the desk clerk suggested we take a short drive to Four Peaks, and we were glad we did.  A local brewery at it's finest!! We arrived late lunch and didn't walk out till after midnight! The set up was perfect, a long bar to belly up to overlooking a sea of tables and even an upstairs balcony with a couple of pool tables. Sampling at least one pint of every flavor that was offered and putting down one appetizer an hour it didn't take long for the staff to realize we were on vacation. The staff was amazing; taking the time to chat with some out of place Texans we learned about the beer they brewed and the places we should go. Since we were there for about 10 hrs we saw the tides of people come in and out during specific windows. The happy hour was vibrant yet relaxed, followed by busy yet orderly dinner rush.   While it's easy to believe that we never stopped smiling because of all the drinking we were doing, the true reason is that we simply were having that good of a time. Perhaps it's a different story for folks from the area, but for those of us vacationing in Scottsdale it is imperative that a stop at Four Peaks is on the agenda!   Thank You Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this place and we were not dissappointed. Everything was so good. Starting with the green Chile pork poutine. So yummy. Chicken enchiladas were good too topped with 2 eggs. Veggie burger was very tasty and so was the steak sandwich. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker, so I cant rave about how delicious the beer is... but I will say that my boyfriend loved it!  He got the (very reasonably priced!) sampler tray, so was able to taste a little bit of everything and was impressed.  My review is based off of the food, which was fantastic!  I never thought I would enjoy a plate of nachos as much as I enjoyed a plate of these nachos!  We ordered a few other apps as well, and they were all absolutely delish.    Very impressed with the food, service was good, prices were great... 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Loved the environment, beer was delicious. I had the Brie burger with a lamb patty and it was great! Chili edamame was like fire in my mouth but addicting at the same time. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Been here a number of times. Consistently good service and food quality. Good for kids and adults."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places in the Phoenix area to eat and drink. I've had a variety of their sandwiches and every one of them has been excellent. The Arizona chicken rolls are an appetizer that can't be missed. They have a wide variety of beers brewed in house so they are always fresh. The atmosphere is welcoming and energetic. This is a great place to catch a sporting event or bring larger groups. The venue usually plays host to a college town crowd and is usually busy but never overwhelming. Service is usually very good. If friends are visiting from out of town, this is where we will go every time. Four Peaks is a Phoenix area staple as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"The game was on.  The atmosphere was loud and jovial.  The calamari was great!  Nice chop salad, bbq chicken pizza, and great beer.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. My servers best skill was looking at herself in the mirror.   The wings were served as I requested, extra crispy. Unfortunately, she got the sauce wrong. I didn't bother to say anything. My buddy got the small serving of nachos and it was huge! I tried a few they were decent.  Other than the crappy service and nothing spectacular food the place is large with a lot of TV's. Based on the positive reviews I would return, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"This rating is for the beer only! Thumbs up on the Hefeweizen, Kilt Lifter, and barley wine! These drinks went down smooth and had great flavor. The Scottsdale location is nice; 2 stories inside, several big screens for those of you that like to watch sports. If you like the beer, you can take home a refillable growler. We spoke with one of the managers when he walked up to our table and encouraged them to start bottling some of their other beers (mainly the Hef). Definitely one of the better microbrews in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a little smaller than you might be used to, maybe it's the layout. About half of the square footage is upstairs with the pool table. The patio is nice and feels more roomy. The food is ok, not as good as Yard House, Rock Bottom, or O.S.H.O (which is right around the corner by the way). They do have some unique brews special to 4 Peaks, I recommend the Kilt Lifter."}
{"text":"5 stars well earned. Their brewed beer was excellent. The service was great. We had two of their happy hour appetizers. The salsa trio and the chicken bombs. Both were good. None of the salsas were spicy but they all had good flavor. Two of us had the special mission burrito which was a large portion and oh so yummy. I had the tap room tenderloin. My taste buds were going crazy. It was so good. The chef salad was a large portion and everything was really fresh a crisp. The lamb burger and fries was excellent and juicy. The biggest problem was trying to take a bite of the large mouth watering burger. The beer battered fries very good. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Kind of unimpressed with the beer. I did the flight of 8 beers, which is a great price at $9. But I didn't get great service since I wasn't going to base my tip on the bra size of the bartenders. The men around me got plenty of attention but I was left to flag one of the girls down to get my tab. Ick."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my son here and it was a great spot for bonding - with the beer and sports all around us! The food was good and the service was excellent- haven't seen a restaurant that has staff as attentive as these guys!"}
{"text":"Go to They Yard House.... For Beer and Food....  Yes - The Yard House is chain but their food is 100000x.  The menu actually sounds more appealing and the food actually is better..  I was looking forward to going to 4 Peaks after hearing great things.  I certainly enjoy a nice cold beer.  (Which they don't have at 4 Peaks - b/c apparently room temperature and slightly colder are the perfect temps to bring out the flavor?!?!  - if thats the case - then why was the frosty mug created?)  Our water was great - straight up honest about what he likes and didn't in regard to the menu - which I really appreciate.  Overall - unimpressed...."}
{"text":"By far our favorite local place! The staff and service is always the best! Food is on point and lots of craft beers on tap!"}
{"text":"I've given Four Peaks 4 stars in a previous review, but I'm taking it back.  I went in two days ago to fill a growler and they turned me away because my growler was from Great Divide Brewery in Denver.  I have two growlers from Four Peaks at home but a Great Divide in my trunk.  In all my travels most every brewery will fill a growler regardless of its origin.  Some brewers actually like to see growlers from other brewers.  It promotes beer and conversation.  I guess Four Peaks wants to be exclusive like Anheiser Busch.  See how that works out for them.  SNOBS! Your policy sucks Four Peaks, and the other patrons watching this had dropped their jaws.  I was embarrassed but you should be more for turning me, a regular, who spends hundreds a month away because of the paint on a growler.  You should also know that I take your growler into Chama Brewery in Albuquerque, Great Divide and Breckinridge in Denver, any Rock Bottom, and Avery and New Belgium in Fort Collins, CO.  The only other Micro brewery to turn me away with a different growler was San Tan Brewery in Chandler, AZ.  And San Tan's master brewer formerly is from Four Peaks.  Go Figure!  Any Phoenix/Scottsdale residents looking to fill a growler, go to Papago brewery.  They don't discriminate."}
{"text":"I've been here three times.  Never a wait. Good food - get the Kale Salad with Blackened Chicken and Chipotle Ranch Good Beer with plenty of Seasonal options. Good Service.  I'd say that the food here doesn't play second fiddle to the beer - at least the food I have had, which is not always the case at a brewery.  The service has always been good.  We have always been sat right away even when it is busy in there.  The one time there was an issue with an order our server was great with getting us what we needed promptly, and 2/3 times a manager even came by our table just to check in and ask us how everything was.  It's hard not to recommend this place if you like checking out local breweries."}
{"text":"Entered the restaurant and hostess went to seat us on hightop in bar, before we could say anything she dropped menus with back to us and walked away. We grabbed the table next to it with our menus and waited for someone to approach us. Hostess back at the front with 4 servers all talking and no one paying attention to us. We waited as several servers went past us and no acknowledgement. This is poor because there were several servers on the floor really doing nothing. The oldest on staff must have been 22. We left and as we walked out I explained to the hostess and server at the door why we were leaving. The response was, \"we must not have heard you\". Man oh Man! Never will go back or ever give them a second chance."}
{"text":"I must preface this review with I've been going to Four Peaks for far over a decade.  It's been awesome for years!  Lately, their Scottsdale location is turning more into a massive daycare center rather than a bar/brewery.  Kids running around tables, screaming, stomping chairs....its pretty ridiculous.  I come to an ADULT establishment to enjoy ADULT activities like drinking alcohol and having conversations with friends.  Lately this has been tough to do with 50+ children in this massive daycare center.  It's gotten to the point where during my last visit I had ask to be reseated as I could barely hear people at my table speak over the screaming, yelling, knocking and playing around taking place a few tables away.  Pretty unacceptable behavior in a bar I'm sorry.  I think the police really need to camp out here and pick up some of the parents drinking and driving with kids in the car.  Until this issue is rectified, I'll be going to places like McFate with an amazing selection of beer and less Chuckie Cheese type feel.  Hopefully Four Peaks gets their act together."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Grilled Chicken Beer Bread during my last visit. Grilled chunks of chicken heaven with sauteed onions and peppers with a great creamy cucumber sauce wrapped in beer bread (sans mushrooms). The service was good. But unfortunately there is no Happy Hour for FOOD, just HH for drinks. This is about the only pub in the general area that I found that doesn't have Happy Hour for food.  Note to Management, although your website is kinda cool, it loads really slow with the T1 line I was using. Took forever to see what was on the menu."}
{"text":"Great beer, decent food, fun atmosphere. Service has always been good when I have been.  If you're craving a fresh beer and some tasty bar food this is the place."}
{"text":"Check out Wingman Collier Four Peaks video Wing review. Great wings especially the oatmeal stout Bq wings. Enjoy the video!  Please share and like. Just type Wingman Collier in search on Facebook & YouTube."}
{"text":"We love this place!  We like to sit at the bar, enjoy a beer and have some good food.  The staff are great, so friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  It is a place for locals who made us \"out of towners\" so very welcome.  We will miss our new friends when we head back north.  Excellent place!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and was looking for a good brewery with food. Well this place nailed it! Beers were amazing loved the Peach Ale and Oatmeal Stout. In addition the oatmeal stout BBQ wings were amazing! To top it off our server Jess was great and she grave us great suggestions. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Scottsdale from Orange County Ca.  We love this type of restaurant, we have been a few times already, the bartenders are SUPER friendly.  The food is absolutely amazing (try the specials) and the Four Peaks Beer is great.  They have a few seasonal beers on tap my husbands favorite is the SunBru and mine is the Stout. This is going to be our place from now on!"}
{"text":"Typically pub food and done very well. Burgers are on point and the popper burger is my favorite. Paired with one of their beers and it makes for a great meal."}
{"text":"Awesome service at great prices.  Not to mention beer selection is outstanding!  Waiter was great in recommending paired beers to our meals obviously knew what he was talking about!  Especially great for Sunday lazy afternoons!  They even change the sport channel to your preference!"}
{"text":"I live close by so I have been several times. One of my favorite places to go!!  The environment is casual and chill. When it's cooler out they have a great retractable wall that opens up as a patio.   The food is fantastic. All the appetizers I have tried are delicious!! Meal wise, I loved the chicken salad.   Now onto the best part- the beer. Kilt lifter is the best. My boyfriend is obsessed with their beer now. The good part is that it's popular beer so many other restaurants also serve it.   Overall a wonderful experience. Great place to bring out of town guests for a taste of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Typical 4 peaks.... so-so interior. Nothing special. I ordered the pretzel which came highly recommended. It was greasy and almost hard. The cheese sauce that came with it was good but later found out it gave me the runs... yikes! As always the beer was cold and delicious... I have visited other 4 peaks locations and by far this was the worst of them all...."}
{"text":"Four peak's is an awesome restaurant. I can not say enough about the place. I have been to all of the locations at least 100+ times. The food is clearly, designed with care and the beer is always great. Being a long time fan, I had to read the negative reviews and I can see some merit to what is being said. These are the reasons I removed one star. Sometimes you get an ditzy hostess or server that makes you feel not very important but it is rare and management watches closely. I have also had a flawed meal here and there. I think the food costs were getting cut and the cooks were getting lazy. Being around and at such quality for so long has taken a bit of a toll on Four Peaks. Still love it and will go until I don't."}
{"text":"After a weird night of visiting 3 different bars that just didn't have the \"vibe\" a girlfriend and I were looking for, we ended up here. This was the best decision ever!! We had an amazing girls' night sampling beers and their new summer shandys.  The food was also terrific. Corrine was our server and she was so awesome we had to brag about her to the manager who came to check on us. I might have a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. My husband enjoyed the beers. We would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great drinks!!!  Good atmosphere  Fantastic food (the bbq chicken pizza is a must)  Nice people to conversate with  What is not to like?  Oh yes, the creepy guy that kept staring at me. Oh well, he will not be there next time I go...I hope :)"}
{"text":"Got there for a Sunday happy hour, which is great because not many places have Sunday happy hours and the beers are $3.50 for a pint.  They have all the usual Four Peaks suspects but only 3 guest brews on tap, so a little disappointing.    We ordered the calamari to start out with and followed it up with the Italian Beef Beer Bread.    I'm not sure what arrived at our table that they called \"calamari\", but I can tell you that's not calamari.  It was more like overpriced fish sticks.  Very disappointing.  They should absolutely not have calamari on the menu if that's what they're going to serve.    The Italian Beef Beer Bread was over a little greasy, but not bad.  I'm not much a fan of battered fries either.  Overall the beer for $3.50 is a worth a visit, but I would probably eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service was good and the food above average. Lots of tv's to watch sports. The waitresses were friendly, shorts and halters. More of an adult place."}
{"text":"My BF and I had a particularly rough day & decided to skip cooking at home and went to Four Peaks around happy hour time last week. I was looking forward to some good food and a couple of glasses of wine. It will be the last time we ever go there.  It took about 15 minutes for anyone to even come over and greet us & take our drink order and even then, we had to go to the hostess stand and pick up our own menus. We decided to split the steak fajitas. We were pleasantly surprised when the food came out quickly. Then I took a couple of bites and realized that the fajitas were so incredibly spicy that I would be unable to eat them. The menu did not describe them as spicy and since Four Peaks is NOT a Mexican restaurant, I would never expect that level of spice. I eat some fairly spicy foods, but this was so spicy that they need to say so on the menu! We could not find our waitress, so we told the hostess about the issue. She just looked at us & said, \"oh..sorry!\" but did nothing, just kept leaning on the hostess stand. Even BF had to stop eating the fajitas - he was sweating bullets!! When the waitress came by over 10 minutes later, she apologized and then said she'd be right back. I thought she was going to get a manager, but no..she just went to deliver drinks to another table. ?? When she came back and asked if I'd like something else. I ordered the calamari appetizer. When it came, I was again disappointed with the menu's description. It wasn't the usual calamari, it was the large, thick, chewy variety instead of the small, crispy & light type. Again, they should put this in the menu description!  I sat with an empty wine glass for 15 minutes and when we got our bill, they had made no concession for the mishap with the fajitas. Our bill was over $50 and I went home hungry. The service was terrible and so was the food."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today, the service was fantastic, fast and accurate. The food was very good and the beer was awesome.  Seems like it would be a fun place to watch your favorite sports game."}
{"text":"Above average service. Friendly bartenders. Free samples of all the craft beers on tap. Sounds like a winner right? Try the food. The portions are huge and its super tasty. Plenty of TV's and a wide variety of patrons makes for fun, safe people watching. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"great service, good nachos and awesome beer!"}
{"text":"Happened upon Four Peaks when we drove up to the restaurant we wanted to go to and there wasn't a car in the parking lot! My hubs and I thought it was just the temps in Scottsdale, and everyone headed out of town for the weekend. However, when we walked into Four Peaks, it blew our assumption out of the water. The place was packed and the only seat left was in the bar, which was OK since we were only there for appetizers and beer.   We ended up ordering 1 entree as an appetizer, the fish and chips. The were quite good! Nicely cooked, not overly greasy and very crunchy.  Hubs got a dark and I got a light. We were very pleased with the beer and will be looking for a 6-pack in the stores.  I'm looking forward to heading back to Scottsdale to hang out here a bit longer and try some of their great looking menu!"}
{"text":"Was in here late last night for some beers and food. I just goto 4P for their seasonal beers.  Ordered - Veggie Burger : tasted delicious. Portions are meal perfect. But was kinda soggy though. Veggie pizza : though I just had a slice of it, just melts in your mouth. Not a mouth watering pizza, but a good pizza.  Beers- this is what you have to visit 4P for. Had 2 Belgian Tropel seasonal beers. Delicious beers.   Ambience is good, I hardly saw any crowd and waitress was kind enough to check status my table frequently."}
{"text":"This is for the Scottsdale location only.  I find this location awkwardly placed in the busy strip mall of Hayden & FLW.  Essentially parking is really hard to find during peak times, the staff tends to be over worked, and all for some over priced bar food.  If you're going here purely for the meal itself, I'd say pass.  If it's a night out sampling IPAs or other tap beers, it's simply ok.  There's a lively mixed crowd typical of Scottsdale where everyone fits in."}
{"text":"Great localcraft brewery and pub. Recommend the seasonal choices, get the pumpkin porter it wont ne around long.  Food is good quality and ample.  Great fish dishes. WAit staff friendly and responsive."}
{"text":"My husband was in the mood for Pumpkin Porter, so we opted to have dinner at Four Peaks.  I'm not a beer drinker, so I can only comment on the food.  It was okay, but nothing to entice me back anytime soon.  We started with the Arizona Chicken Rolls..an egg roll of sorts with chicken, cheese, and chiles.  If your philosophy is \"the cheesier the better,\" these are for you.  For me it was like eating a cheese egg roll.  We also shared the chicken strips and the fish & chips.  My first thought with the chicken strips was that they had used nasty cooking oil.  My husband pointed out it was the beer batter (8th Street Ale).  Whatever it was, I didn't care for it at all, and neither did he.  The fish was okay, although it's served in smaller pieces rather than large filets.  So 2 stars for the food and 4 for the beer judging by the fact we had to take a growler home with us."}
{"text":"I have been to this location at least a dozen times. The food is always good, whether its the burgers, pizzas or salads.  The Chef's Salad is a fave. Not only is it huge, ingredients are always fresh, with crisp lettuce and big chunks of lean meat.  Burgers are 1/2 pound and I have never had to send one back due to incorrect cooking - when I say, \"Burn it!\", it always comes out hot and dark all the way through.  Other highlights include spanekopita, pretzels, fish and chips.  Not such a big fan of the seasoned steak-fries; the seasoning is inconsistent and the fries are sometimes mushy. Waffle fries would make a much better match for their main-course offerings. Service is always attentive (and always cute), atmosphere is laid-back, but very clean, with no offensive odors. Lots of TVs to watch games, even on their big patio."}
{"text":"Nothing to get excited about here. Ordered up a pale ale which was respectable but downhill from there. The culinary offerings were bland and not very well presented. The \"grilled\" wings really did not have any distinction from fried. And don't order the poutine it is like no other I have ever eaten and not in a good way. Had the hanger steak on polenta and quite honestly it was bland and not pretty. My associate ordered the Salmon special and felt it was adequate but again uninspiring. Our server was pleasant and attentive. If you are here fir the beer you are in the right place but might want to snack before"}
{"text":"This place is awesome enjoyed a few drafts! Got taken care of katelynn ! I will be back !"}
{"text":"Love this local place where the staff has a good memory of their past customers. Good pub & their seasonal are superb compared to other local breweries. Tito is the bartender to go to..."}
{"text":"Decent spot, about what you would expect from a brew-pub.  This was my first time trying Four Peaks beers and I thought they were ok.  The food was your typical pub far, but much better quality.  The hummus stood out.  Would definitely return if in the area."}
{"text":"The poutine fries are to die for, love kiltlifter on tap. I will definitely be back to try more food and beer. Waitress was awesome even though the place was packed for lunch."}
{"text":"Ended up enjoying our Sunday-night half priced wine at The Living Room a bit to late, and quickly ran out of dining options... luckily we found this spot had their kitchen up till!  Figured it would be burger/pizza fare, but was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful center cut filet (seared to perfection) that I was able to get for $20.   Group also got a couple burgers, all of which were generously loaded with their respected ingredients--many of which were quite creative--and served with fries that I swear were some of the best I have ever had.  Also got a cool selection of their own beers, including an aged \"barley wine\" that was interestingly sweet, while boasting an 11.2% alcohol level.  ...seriously though... what is the story with these french fries? I may go back just for another basket.  Point being:  Way-better-than-pub-food kinda food... great atmosphere, nice people, good beer!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Four Peaks. What I don't love is Scottsdale. Or the people who inhabit it, really. Including the servers.  I've been a fan of FP for a LONG time. Great food, incredible beer, and great times. On this occasion, and it doesn't happen often, I wanted to tell the girl serving us that she should get the fuck off of her phone, stop bullshitting with the bartender, and do some fucking work. Like serving us, because she voluntarily accepted a position as a server in a bar.   We got there and got seated at a high top, which we asked for. When I saw that the Pumpkin Porter was on tap, I HAD to have me summa dat! And so we waited. Annnnnnnnnndddddddd waited. And still we waited..... for a server to arrive to ask us what we would like to drink.  It took us long enough to figure out what we wanted to order before the server showed up. So, she took our drink order, and started to turn around... NOT SO FAST, MY FRIEND!!!.... we placed our food order, as well.   The drinks came first. Yep. And instead of a rum and Coke, we got a diet rum. YUCK. And so we waited.... And I finally said FUCK THIS SHIT!! and got up and walked my happy ass up to the bar and placed it on the bar for a new one. The bartender, in all of her preciousness, acted like it was going to be an act of Congress to replace the drink. Instead of simply replacing the drink, she went to the well, poured the drink, and left it in the window to be picked up by the server. And the server came with the drink... And the comment, \"Um... Yeah... I rang it in as a Rum and Coke, and she swears she poured a rum and Coke.... Try this, and see if it's better.\" Listen here, server girl.. I don't give a shit who did what, or why. And I'm not looking for a Congressional inquiry, either. I just care that we get what we order in a timely, and professional fashion.   When our food came, we ordered 2 Growlers of Pumpkin Porter. The server says, \"Um.... Did you want me to get those NOW???? Or....??? Like, I can wait until you're ready to leave.\" I was thinking, we've tried this whole \"waiting for you to do your job thing, and it's just not working out too well\", but refrained from speaking it.   The Twin Peaks rejects are beginning to infiltrate my beloved Four Peaks. Blonde, snotty, sarcastic, and snide, lots of cleavage, and dumb as a bag of hammers.... Glad I went to a horse show following the experience. They (the horses) allowed me to reconnect with intelligence."}
{"text":"A good place to grab a brew.  If you are a fan of their original location in tempe, then you should like this place as well.  Since they are not located next to a college, ambiance here is tame compared to the other, so obviously do not expect the same crowd.  It may not be as lively, but it is still good.  I always sit at the bar, so my needs are fulfilled by the bartender, and they always are on top of my drink orders.  They are friendly and helpful if you have any questions.  I have not eaten at this location yet, but since its your quintessential bar fare, I am in no rush to order anything anytime soon.    Its a decent place to grab your favorite four peaks brews if your not in the mood to drive to tempe."}
{"text":"I love beer. No I'm not talking about the mass marketed, mass distributed stuff that supposedly tastes great and is less filling. I'm talking about the flavorful heady craft brews that are interesting and actually flavorful. I enjoy beer much like I do food; it's a celebration of diversity, history and sensual stimulation, simply put, it appeals to all of your senses. One of the many cool things about beer is that it's like a meal in itself. With so many varieties to chose from there's bound to be one for every individual appetite out there.  Now where to get a great pint for a reasonable price?  If you're not familiar, Four Peaks Brewery has been serving up tasty pints in the valley for years. Having 2 locations and a loyal following of people who appreciate beer, tasty pub grub at super low prices, both locations are pretty hopping on most nights. If you've ever heard of Kilt Lifter and 8th Street Ale which are served in most valley restaurants, those are Four Peaks creations.  The Tempe location actually has the whole brewery thing going on in a large warehouse type space, which was a creamery back in the day that now has the massive stainless steel vats for making some of their most beloved brews. The Scottsdale location has a similar warehouse feel including a more private mezzanine level. The bartenders and wait staff are very attractive and friendly, which you know gets kudos from me and if one of them is sporting a beard, even better! Though with the case of our server, it was definitely style over substance, maybe a bad hair day?  Besides being with friends there isn't anything that goes better with good beer than good food. The menu seems to have been written with the beer in mind as well as used as an ingredient. The menu isn't super large but is easy to navigate with many salads, sandwiches and pizza's to choose from. Aside from everything being well priced, the portions are quite hefty, you won't leave hungry.  If you visit their website, be sure to sign up for the daily menu specials email. You'll receive 2 emails a day that features lunch and dinner specials for that day or night. The specials menu really gives the Four Peaks chefs a chance to be even more fun and creative. They can also be followed on Twitter as well as Facebook, isn't social networking great?!  Great meals here begin with a great beer.  You'll notice a chalk board up on the wall displaying which beer is available including its alcohol content. You can use this as a point of reference as to how loaded you might end up. So be careful with the darker beers, not only will they fill you up like a meal in a glass but tend to get you snookered before the meal arrives. The Portero Chingon ($3) was an amazing Porter full of dark complexities with hints of chocolate and coffee. Those notes for me paired very well with the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($14.50/$17.50) which had a nice sweet and smoky sauce loaded with tender chicken breast. Pizzas come in 2 sizes, 12\" and 14\" but the 12\" is of good heft and made a great appetizer for the table.   To stand up to some of the stronger flavors of beer, the Bleu Light Special Burger ($9) with its thick juicy patty, hickory smoked bacon and smothered with blue cheese crumbles, was well grounded and a solid choice. Just to let you in on something, Four Peaks makes amazing beer bread it's similar to a really soft pita and makes for a great substitute to an ordinary bun. All sandwiches are served with your choice of beer battered fries, pasta salad or a garden salad; I went for the fries and couldn't have been happier with my choice. The fries are so light and crunchy you might finish yours and eat off a friend's plate and no I didn't do that. Yes I did.  Now some sandwiches are served natively on beer bread like the Grilled Chicken Beer Bread ($9). They start with grilled chicken breast then add sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms, green peppers, red onion, mozzarella and then top with a creamy cucumber sauce for a Greek/Mediterranean flare. Try ordering a Hefeweizen ($4) to accompany since the bright lemon notes tasted so great with the chicken and vegetables on the sandwich. Or, have a beer sampler with your meal ($9) so you can taste several different beers and see which one works best for your tastes. The melted Swiss cheese and the tangy sauerkraut on the Reuben ($8.50) tasted good with the Kilt Lifter ($4) but I'm excited to try the Oatmeal Stout ($4) next time.  Beer bread, beer battered fries and drinking beer, sounds like a beer fest right? It get's even more interesting for desserts, you wont find a Tiramisu like this one. Called the Stoutamisu ($5) they take espresso soaked chocolate sponge cake, then layer it with Oatmeal Stout lady fingers and chocolate mascarpone cream. Its feather light and a mile high though not as sickening sweet as many I've tried. Goes down like many of the Four Peaks brews, nice and smooth."}
{"text":"We've eaten at the Scottsdale location many times over the past 7 years. The food is consistently good. The veggie sandwich on beer bread is so good it's hard for me to stray from it (it is truly delicious) but almost everything we've had - from burgers to enchiladas to pretzels and out son eats off of the kids' menu - is delicious. It can be a bit loud and crowded on weekend nights but that is a testament to the food and drink quality (husband likes the beer). Definite thumbs up - try it!!!"}
{"text":"I just had the best dinner with one of my good friends! I love Four Peaks!!! There are so many good beers to choose from but my all-time go-to is the PEACH ALE! It never fails me. Why the 4 stars!?- You might ask, they got rid of my FAVORITE menu item, the CHICKEN SALAD PITA. Why did they have to take it away?! : .. (  Luckily they still have their pasta salad (which is epic if you haven't tried it).  Four Peaks is a classic here in AZ and each and everyone of you should GO!"}
{"text":"Well I sure feel like and Idiot.  I found Four Peaks actually via Yelp, go there almost weekly and now have a smorgasbord of empty brown jugs filling my top kitchen cupboards.  What's that tell you ;)  The AZ Peach and IPA's are my favorite and I will be a customer for a long time."}
{"text":"Descent pizza, wings, and surprisingly good nachos. Great place for an AZ rugby referee social after a rainy tournament. The waitress was great about keeping track of group to individual tabs and it was able to seat a group of ~15 of us all at the same table and it was nice to be able to hear everyone. Laid back good time around dinner but coming out of the restroom on my way out I was greeted with a giant inflatable male body part sending me the vibe it might be a little different at night!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brew houses in the valley. The location in Tempe makes and sells the beer, while this location just sells it, which is just fine. Located in a strip mall in North Scottsdale, it's an unassuming place from the outside. However, once inside you will find a decent size bar and dining room, including seating inside, outside and upstairs. Of course, you have to start with the beer. Their Scottish ale \"Kiltlifter\" (get the name?) is an annual award winning beer. However, their IPA, \"Hop Knot\" is slowly becoming my favorite. Their food is good and filling and worth trying. Finally the staff is very friendly. Try this place to see why they continue to earn the reviews."}
{"text":"Great Burgers and Beer. Love the atmospher to just hang out with friends,"}
{"text":"Found this place while in search of something that was open late.  I thought the fact that it was 11 meant I would have to get crappy food somewhere.  I was wrong.  The food here was good.  We got turkey burgers and the chicken rolls .  The burger was a little bland but the fries were great, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside."}
{"text":"I loved this place. We went in kind of late on a Sunday night with a bigger party and they were more than accommodating. Everything we ate/drank here was great. I got a beer flight for around $10 and really liked all of their beer offerings. I'm usually not a fruity beer guy, but the peach beer was great.  The nachos and pretzel appetizers were both fantastic. Their fries are out of this world (like some of the best I've ever had). Their pizza was great. Their sandwiches were great. Food overall was great. Service was impeccable. I'll definitely be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Great to find the home of Kiltlifters! Portions were large, yet the beef filet might a been thin sirloin also had the ahi special, which was goo and a touch spicey, which I liked.  Service was good and the place was not too loud.     and thanks to their wireless we found Lukes of Chicago, where I'll be tommorrow for lunch..."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The beers are fresh and flavorful. The people are outstanding; the service is excellent.  Tons of big tvs.   It's such a great place to spend a few hours or grab a quick drink."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the staff was even better!! Highly recommend. The beer is great too :) loved having dinner there, would recommend and go back in a heartbeat!! The bartender never let our drinks get low and was wonderful."}
{"text":"I understand the point of trying to reach out to a larger crowd.  In this case, stick to the original.  Don't get me wrong I love Four Peaks beer and the bar in general.  If it's located by ASU.  The North scene for this kind of atmosphere is just lacking and doesn't make sense.  Four Peaks is meant for the college crowd and rowdy rah rah of the kids cheering and jeering the screen as they watch the games.  This Four Peaks seem stale and old.  It almost makes up for it but definitely falls short.  Sorry Four Peaks this part of the town is too steep to try to climb for now.  I'll make my way back South to the original. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"There is not a single brewery that beats Four Peaks food.  Their Pumpkin Porter is the greatest beer ever created in all the lands of the earth, and their Oatmeal Stout BBQ sauces kicks even Chuck Noris's ass.    Oh yeah, their artichoke dip is amazing too - the only thing i wasn't a fan of was their white sauce pizza....but hey, they're normal pizza is amazing so it's all good and that's only my opinion, maybe it'll be a vacation in your mouth...."}
{"text":"Whoever says their Nachos are amazing must have already been drunk. Went there this evening specifically for these \"amazing\" nachos. Five bucks for a half order and four bucks to add chicken. Filiberto's nachos are better than these..and I don't even like filiberto's nachos. If you're looking for amazing nachos, go to Blancos Tacos. Don't waist your time or money. Btw, I also had one of their personal pizzas here, the Abe Froman....it was completely soggy and the bottom was (obviously) saturated in oil. The pizza did taste good, can't lie on that...but the soggy dough made me disappointed. We were upstairs and we had a great waiter. Totally polite and kept our drinks full Great service on that end. He had glasses and spiked hair. Don't remember his name. But he was great."}
{"text":"Ya know how people say \"I really wanted to like this place\" or \"I want to like this place more than I do\"? It's such a stupid thing to say, because obviously you want to like a place, you don't go somewhere and say \"I really want to hate spending my money here and eating their food.\"   Well anyway, rant aside. I do actually want to like this place and I come here pretty regularly, but the service is so annoying. My work buddies and I like to come in after work for a few beers and some food. The food is pretty good, I love their spicy Thai hummus, and the beers are obviously great, the patio is comfortable with heaters in the winter as well. But the service just irks the crap out of me. The girls usually are swamped no matter how many people are there. Most of the time, we don't even know who our server actually is because two or three people come over and take our orders. Sometimes the first girl leaves and trades us off to someone new, or the girl just flat out disappears.  Most of the time, our drinks sit empty until someone finally sees us and takes another order, other times our drinks aren't even halfway empty and theyre trying to get us another round.   They're friendly and nice, but being nice isn't really the only way to do things. Meh, maybe I'm too critical, but I shouldn't have to ask the food runner for plates, napkins and silverware. Or glasses of water like three or four times.   I'll keep coming here because the alternative options suck even more :ahem Twin Peaks ahem Skeptical Chymist ahem:"}
{"text":"I came here with a large group for one of my coworkers farewell dinner and it was fun place to hangout.  I cannot comment on beer but others drinking that night seemed to have good time and each was able to find their own favorite as they have nice selection of beers. Their happy hour is very long and it starts at 2pm until 6pm. Most of them seemed to have enough drink only after 2 hours.  No happy hour food, just drinks but food was reasonably priced, some of them were not too bad at all.  I was coordinating this work event and my job was to be a designated driver as well as make sure everyone had drink and food in front of them. Service here was excellent, before I had chance to ask for more drink for others, staff noticed before me and quickly came over to bring more drinks and food.  Everyone in our group had a great time thanks to the friendly servers here."}
{"text":"I have to say that I prefer the Tempe location much more. But seeing as it's hell on Earth outside (literally) I was taking no chances with parking or seating so I chose to come here. The atmosphere has a fun sports bar feel and the service is pleasant enough.  My beer batter chicken strips were tasty but it was the garlic cheese beer bread that was the best part of my meal. There must be crack in the marinara because it was damn good.  I don't know if I'd make it a habit of visiting this location but there are a lot worse places I could have ended up."}
{"text":"This Four Peaks have an upstairs in the restaurant which I think is cool. Service is ok even when you are up there.   I ate the chicken quesadilla and it was amazing. It was full of meat and flavor. It was so totally unexpected.   However, I was disappointed with the wings. Two orders and both were dry and fried a little too much. Totally not juicy.   When it comes to types of restaurant like this, I would still choose Four Peaks. Food is good and the beer is great. Service depends on the waitress. But overall I say it's a good place to gather to enjoy your time with your friends. If you drink enough, then you'll have the best time of your life.   For a bigger outdoor patio, I suggest going to the tempe location but they don't have upstairs though. And parking is a little rough at the tempe location."}
{"text":"This is an easy one, we go to one of the Four Peaks locations at least once per month and I've been happy every single time.  Always solid service, kid friendly (without turning into a kid-only restaurant), food is great, and of course the beer....  When I have a client moving into town I make sure to bring them here, it's the perfect local place to show off."}
{"text":"This place is best!! Sports bar & grill, the food is fantastic the service is amazing an good people to be around"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times & had great service the first time and the food was awesome. Second time it was okay service but the food didn't taste anything like it did the first time, and I got the same thing. It was crazy packed the second time we went and the wait was 45 minutes. Which I didn't mind, the bartenders were on point & got you a drink as soon as you got up to the bar. But the hostess who sat us had no personality, didn't greet us, say hello or anything. She put the menus down & walked away. It was so awkward. And like I said above the food wasn't as good. Was disappointed the second time around."}
{"text":"I stopped by at 7 AM on St Patty's Day.  Got my free t-shirt, a Kiltlifter and corned beef hash.  A great start to a great day!"}
{"text":"There's not a whole lot that I love more in life than good craft beer and hummus.  I'm not saying that Four Peaks takes the cake on both of these things, but it's become one of my regular go-tos in Phoenix.  It's a great, all american kind of place that most people will love but it's not commercialized and generic.  I find myself at Four Peaks for just about any occasion and I'm rarely disappointed.  It still feels like a cool, neighborhood joint.  But there is something about the Tempe location that feels more authentic and original than the Scottsdale location.    Here are some highlights gathered from many visits to both the Scottsdale and Tempe locations.   Beer - Oatmeal Stout or any seasonal on tap  Food - Thai Hummus, Chicken Fingers, anything on beer bread  Service - amazing servers and bar tenders!  they always make you feel like a regular and love to chat with all of their guests."}
{"text":"I have to say the service here is superb and keeps me coming back for more. If you enjoy great beer and good food you will love this place.  The environment is upbeat and lively.  If you're not a fan of noise though might not be the place for you, personally I love it"}
{"text":"Four Peaks Brewery had me at hello! Our server Jess skipped her way to our table and set the tone for a fun night. I started out with a porter that was delicious if you like dark beers with a strong aftertaste. My friends ordered the sampler and I tried the peach ale which is definitely a refreshing summer beer. The oatmeal stout was also delicious and incredibly smooth. Highly recommend it for fellow stout lovers! I saved the best part for last tho... The oatmeal stout bbq wings are to die for! Cooked to a crispy perfection with the ideal amount of bbq sauce. Overall a great experience. I will be visiting this place again on my next trip to Scottsdale from New Jersey :)"}
{"text":"First off, I have to say that I'm not a beer drinker. Hubby ordered the sampler (a small glass of each of their brews) and I didn't like any of them, even the peach ale. He liked most of them thought, so I guess the brews are pretty good.  The food was good, but a bit bland. Again, hubby had the best meal of the night with their fish and chips and fries. The fish and chips was some of the best I've ever had- fresh, crispy, and perfectly cooked. I had the Mediterranean pizza and it was good, but needed salt. The chicken was a bit overcooked, but that's hard to avoid when you cut it so small and thin. The pizza's crust had a great flavor and was crispy without being dry. Our friend ordered the shrimp carbonara and it was seriously under-salted and under-seasoned. I don't think she was impressed with the parmesan bread that came with it either.  Main complaint of the night (other than some of the food being bland) was that the service was a bit slow and inattentive. My food (the pizza) came out first even though on the menu it said to expect to wait longer for a pizza. The waitress went back several times before she came out with hubby's fish and chips. It also took a while for the waitress to check on us, bring the check, etc. Granted, it was a Friday night but it wasn't like the place was packed out the door.   Oh, and this place was LOUD."}
{"text":"I would first like to emphasize the fact that I went to this restaurant on a monday night, which was possibly why nobody was there.  The athmosphere could have been really good if there was a lot of people but on a monday night it was very lacking. The food was just average and the emphasis of the restaurant was the beer so the food was just as exspected. Overall, it was a fine meal but I am not jumping up and down to go back."}
{"text":"Great brewery with some excellent in house beers. Food is average but ambiance needs some real work."}
{"text":"Great stop after soccer tournament, service was awesome, beer cold and food delicious! Cute patio space with roll up garage door"}
{"text":"Looking for a laid back place to go enjoy a brewski with friends, family, on a date, or even solo?  Four Peaks Brewery is your place.  Not only is the staff extremely attentive, but the atmosphere is awesome, and the food is pretty impressive as well!  I've been to this Scottsdale location a couple of times and had really great experiences.  The spinach salad with salmon is delicious - made with fresh spinach, goat cheese, veggies, and perfectly cooked salmon... get it with the raspberry dressing - it rocks!  The spinach artichoke dip and the beer bread sandwiches are tasty also - and guess what?  Their entire menu goes well with beer.  Imagine that?!  I've enjoyed their Peach Ale and Sun Brew, but I imagine you can't go wrong with whatever beer you're in the mood for...   An extra bonus is that this location is walking distance to the Regal Sonoran 10 movie theater, so you can go enjoy a beer and/or a meal before or after a movie no problem - it makes for my favorite kind of night!"}
{"text":"This place is always consistently good.  They obviously have a great beer selection on tap, but the food is also very good.  The jalapeno popper burger is awesome and something I've never seen anywhere else.  Service is always friendly and efficient.  And of course, you can get six-packs to go."}
{"text":"Came in tonight for some food and beers after kickball. Plenty of table Inside and outside and it was seat yourself. Our server was Jamie and she was awesome. Super friendly and joked with us but also made sure we were always taken care of!   I got the Buffalo chicken wings appetizers. There was 10 I believe with a ton of celery and carrots. Plenty to share. The wings were huge with tons of meat. The sauce had a good spice and flavor. My husband got a pastrami sandwich with a pesto pasta salad that was really good as well. We both loved the pesto pasta salad. Was refreshing and a good change from the normal french fry.   Overall everything was super great. Jamie let us know of the happy hour so we will definitely be back! Be a great place to kick back on the patio or watch a sports game."}
{"text":"Four Peaks is okay.  Food is decent, but isn't really my style.  I don't have a favorite thing here.  I hear the burgers are good (and I have not tried them), though.  Service has always been ok, nothing memorable.  The Scottsdale location is full of a certain type of crowd I cannot stand, and every time I visit I remember why I rarely go here.  The beer is okay.  I think SanTan brewery is far better, and as breweries go across the US it's nothing memorable.  It seems to have a following from locals and people who went to ASU - if you aren't either it's an okay dining experience."}
{"text":"Great beer & a huge menu - definitely a place you can take just about anyone to & they'll find something they like.   I ordered the salmon BLT which was fabulous. Fun atmosphere, good service - we'll be back."}
{"text":"Good beer and fries but the burger wasn't great. Service was good. I can't believe it's a Minnesota Vikings Bar in the middle of AZ."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game or even just hang out.  Very friendly staff, good food, nice atmosphere.  I'm not a huge beer drinker but they had a wide selection that all seem to be popular.    It gets busy, but the staff is always on top of things and you're never left waiting for very long."}
{"text":"Good place to make a visit after catching a flick! Being that I was in the same plaza and appreciate the local brewery just couldn't pass up! Came in for drinks and amazed by the variety of flavor of beers  and a small selection of wines ! I ended up the night with filling my growler at an affordable cost of $9.00 bucks. Awesome service from the server to the manager, thank you '"}
{"text":"Joined up with some folks here for happy hour before a movie on Thursday.  The spinach/artichoke dip appetizer was great and really could suffice for two of me for a dinner.  The was my first taste of Kiltlifter and I am a fan!  The address shows Pima Rd and I spent 15 minutes cruising the parking lot before I figured out it faces Hayden."}
{"text":"Four peaks has the best beer in the north valley with great value. I recommend this place for any beer/foodie person around."}
{"text":"The four peaks peach sangria was delicious. We also had the soft pretzels with the jalapeño cheese and the cheese sauce was so good!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Beer battered veggie portobello rolls are extremely good.   Great place."}
{"text":"Came here with a group after our kickball game down the road. The food was good, there is not an argument there. The Kilt lifter has become my favorite beer since moving to AZ. We were seated outside, and the staff was pretty attentive to us. While we were there, a fuse blew and the misters/outside lights went off for the better part of 15 minutes. They handled it well and let us know the status. Overall, I enjoyed the experience but there was nothing \"wow\" about it, considering the great things I've heard about this brewery from the locals..."}
{"text":"Simple math:  1 Pint Hop Knot + 2 Hot Bavarian Pretzels with Spicy Mustard = 21 hours of being awake totally worth it"}
{"text":"Mini version of the Four Peaks in Tempe.  Tasty food, lots of beer options, and fun atmosphere.  However, service is just OK.   Parking: This can be crowded, but just to the east, there are more parking spots, just walk a bit.   Service: Eh, maybe it's just the times I've gone, but the service is just OK.  The woman who was our waitress the first time was not super friendly and had to keep saying \"what?\"  She was just ok.   Food: Wow, much better than I recall. I got a veggie wrap, and it had the best taste! I even ate the leftovers and enjoyed every bite. The pizza is good too.   Beer: There are numerous beer options, just like at the Tempe location."}
{"text":"As you may have read in a previous review, so graciously provided by Dally, that Four Peaks is our post-Tuesday night hockey watering hole. We normally show up stinky and limping or in some sour mood or another. Somehow we always leave a little happier, but still limping, well I do anyway.   Unfailingly, we are greeted by the bouncer, who no longer cares to see our ID's, either because he can see the age in our strides or because he knows us now. I would like to believe the latter. Also, waiting for us is the lovely and nicht so talented Karina. Bless her poor soul for putting up with our asinine questions about her life and our requests for more water. She humors us anyway.   We are made to feel like this place is home, at least for a couple of hours on a Tuesday night. Karina knows what we order for drinks and never has to ask, just brings. I usually switch between a simple salad with a great balsamic vinaigrette or a plate of fries. I know, diametrically opposed. Just depends on the mood and how committed I am that day/week to my diet. I always get the 8th St Ale though. It is very good and for 3 bucks can't be beat.   I have enjoyed the pretzels, the now \"famous\" nachos, with chicken mind you, the spinach-artichoke dip, some of the various wing flavors, and a pizza. For late night dining they are all very palatable.  I have a funny wing story, but I think it is only funny to me, Dallas, Z, and our friend Peter.  If we ever get the elusive Z to join, I will make sure he shares his story on here.  Until then, check out Four Peaks in Scottsdale.  The late night menu satisfies and is not hard on the wallet.  Tell Karina Brad sent you.  You won't get a discount, maybe just a laugh."}
{"text":"Love the sampler! All the beers are great! And very local tasting, with lots of flavor! The service is friendly and attentive... love this place!!"}
{"text":"If you want to go to Four Peaks go to the original one in Tempe. This place is hit or miss: in this location. Food was cold. They had to come back and give us new plates. Great service though."}
{"text":"Four Peaks has my heart.  I frequented the Tempe location regularly on Thursday nights when I was at ASU, and I literally got tears in my eyes when I moved north after graduation and discovered the North Scottsdale location.  When I walk in the door, I feel like I'm in Billings, Montana...and I love it!  Down to earth, authentic and quality.  For detailed info, check out the 35+ Tempe location reviews.  I will say that Four Peaks' Peach Ale made me fall in love with beer, and that their food is just phenomenal, far superior than what you would expect from a typical brewery.  The specials consistently impress me, but when in doubt, my default choice is the chicken beer bread (like a hot flatbread wrap with artichokes, green pepper, onion mozzarella) with either the beer bread fries (so freaking yummy) or side salad (honestly can't go wrong, I just crave their salads sometimes).  I think I've tried almost every appetizer and they are all delicious and huge, you can easily order several for a group and call it dinner.  The spinach artichoke dip is a big crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"I can't believe it has taken me this long to review Four Peaks!  Five stars all the way!!  I waited for years for Four Peaks to can their Peach Ale, and it has finally happened.  The Peach Ale is hands down the most refreshing and real peach flavored beer I've ever tasted.  The food is also amazing.  I usually get the beer bread sandwich, but I tried the burger special of the day last time we ate there and it was also great.  Kiltlifter is one of mine and my hubby's favorite beers (and we've tried thousands!)  You can't go wrong with anything there!"}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff.  Great for lunch or dinner.  Fun place to watch the game or meet for happy hour or drinks.   Craft brews for every taste.  Can't miss salads too"}
{"text":"Fun place as well as good food. We wanted micro brews and tv to watch MNF and it delivered. I had the beer battered Italian beef w/fries, huge helping. My buddy had the French dip and enjoyed it. The Irish ale was great!"}
{"text":"BEST atmosphere in the metro area (for the Tempe Brewery location).  Really historic!!!  The food is EXCEPTIONAL, especially since it's mainly pub food.  They had $3.75 pints for the various happy hours!!  The beer is fabulous!!  Parking can be tough.  Service is ok.  Usually good for watching sports, too."}
{"text":"Good food, but beers were average at best.  A little surprised because I was expecting the opposite. I had the chicken enchiladas with a couple of over easy eggs on top.  Not as good as Pappasito's in Houston/Atlanta, but compared to other options, quite tasty. My daughter enjoyed the burger.  Sampled three beers including the double pumpkin, peach ale, white ale and gave up and order the kölsch which was disappointing as well."}
{"text":"Great service and food... Enjoy the atmosphere. Great place to watch sport.. offers an upstairs for private parties."}
{"text":"Great selection of Four Peaks brews along with guest ones.  The pumpkin porter was excellent. I'm not a great fan of beer, but this one I finished.  The quesadilla was crisp and not soggy.  Try it with chicken.  My dining partner had the salmon BLT and it was very good.  Huge place with friendly staff and a fine variety of beers."}
{"text":"Awesome beers and friendly atmosphere.....great service from Maggie and Glen.  They were very friendly.   The wings were great."}
{"text":"Example: This is the best steakhouse in town...oops, let's get started.   I won't take too much of your time because you have better things to do than read the garbage I am about to spew.  I've come to four peaks on several occasions throughout their time at the Hayden location. Up until yesterday, I had never tried their food but I thought I would try something that was unique to them (at least in regards to my definition of what unique is).   Fire was everywhere. Above me fire, below me fire, all around me was fire. Somehow I was suspended in fire but how did I get here?  So I tried the Chicken Bombs. Deep Fried Chicken and Jalapenos with some other ingredients that tore apart the lining in my stomach. They tasted great and only cost $6 and a nights sleep.   Going in, a really nice experience. Going in.   What lay before me that night might be an inside joke at Four Peaks, I am not sure, but I don't think I deserved it. I literally am on fire in my sphincter area and OMG!  That being said, I really enjoyed the Kilt lifter and my waitress was very helpful. In fact she suggested the Chicken Bombs so now, come to think of it, she may be more evil than helpful.   Peace"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today. I had the chicken strips & beer battered fries. Unfortunately, I was so hungry I forgot to take a picture. The chicken strips were good. It was $11 and I got about 6-8 skinny strips. They had great flavor and were super crispy which was nice. I hate soggy chicken strips. The fries tasted like regular fries. It came with a chipotle ranch which I wasn't a fan of. I saw some other things on the menu that I hope to try. Will definitely be back."}

The Quesadilla is not only stuffed with Cheese, but it has melted Cheese on top of it as well.  The Wings, Burgers, Pizza and the rest of the dished listed above are good too.    The Beer is outstanding...I love trying the various brews and guest brews on tap.  Service here is so/so....good most of the time, but we've had some bad service on occasion.  Overall, it's still one of our favorite joints in town and I highly recommend it.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"What does awesome food + great beer equal?  Wednesdays regular hang out. Try a special. Its always yummy. And, be sure to sit in Corrine's section. She's the best! The North Scottsdale location rules because of her!!"}
{"text":"SImply the best  Beer and Food in town.  I love the 8th street ale.."}
{"text":"Been to this place many many times and I have had varied experiences. Bar tending staff is great and very knowledgable but when I have sat at a table it's always been rough the food does not come out as order, and I always get the feeling that their is never enough staff as the servers are always running around. This is not their fault by any means but it is a little frustrating that on multiple visits I am trying to flag down a server. All in all good beer selection and above average food, but expect to wait if you go later at night when they are busy."}
{"text":"Went to Four Peaks on Friday, June 7th and Jessica was our server.  Very rude and she had no suggestions other than a sneer remark of \"you might as well order a pitcher\".  I've been to Four Peaks in Tempe before but I thought that I would give Four Peaks Scottsdale a try and I was dissapointed.  On the same evening I went to Twin Peaks which is on the corner of Hayden and Frank Lloyd Wright and they had colder beer and WAY BETTER SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service from the bartenders. Ordered a Kale & Salmon salad, no bacon, was phenomenal! Great place to watch baseball, hockey, or whatever sport you please. They are accommodating to your TV requests as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place! Fantastic service. Our server Sebastian was extremely helpful and friendly. He was extremely informative about all the beer and how they are made. We both really enjoyed our lunch. I had a steak sandwich and my husband had a burger. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places on the planet.  Why???  Start with the beer. Always been good, but they've continued to take it to the next level. I fell in love in 1997 with their oatmeal stout. Of course, the Kilt Lifter is their flagship award winner and never disappoints. Love, love, love the Hop Knot. Friends of ours swear by the Sunbru Kolsch.   On this occasion their Octoberfest was fresh on tap. Stellar. So delicious.  Next, the food. While the menu screams bar food, it is quite good. They put thought and care into it, including matching up beers on the menu.   Service is simply outstanding. I mean over the top great and attentive.   Do NOT come here to have a Bud Light people. Live a little. Enjoy some of Arizona's finest craft beer, good food, and awesome service.  Parking can really suck if it's busy, so use the valet."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time on Friday night and had a blast. Our Server Jamie was FABULOUS and totally made our experience top notch!! The beer (we both ordered the flight), the food (we shared calamari, fish and chips as well as a pizza ), and the staff were all awesome. I cannot say enough about this place. I cant wait to come back and bring even more people. Thank you Jamie for making our night truly great. We will be back real soon!!!"}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite brewery's in town with awesome food and beer. I was back for a recent trip, and this was my must stop at place while up in North Scottsdale! I love the beer. And I especially love the \"pub food\" they serve. In my opinion Four Peaks has some of the best burgers in town. They are HUGE... and reasonably priced for what you get. My favorite is the Jalapeno Popper burger... you gotta try it. The Bavarian pretzel is a must have appetizer. I like sitting outdoors, as the inside can get a little crowded and very noisy at peak times. I do not like sitting upstairs at all."}
{"text":"Seems to be a pretty happening place. Service is outstanding. Several varieties of beer to choose from. You can get samples before you decide,  that really helps. I have the peach beer which was outstanding! And on the specials was an elk burger. I have never tried before so I thought I was being adventurous it was pretty good actually a very lean type of meat, very tasty. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"this is by far my favorite bar in the valley.  the beer is fabulous and they have a fantastic late night menu and drink specials. i love that i can order food until 1am.  we always sit at the bar and have great service, but i can't attest to the service in the rest of the restaurant.   the patio is a great spot to sit and people-watch and relax."}
{"text":"Our experience started off bad as we had to wait for about 5 to 7 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us. After we waved down a passing waitress, she someone would be with us. Then a girl came up and asked how we were doing and we said we would be doing better if we could get seated. She then said..\"well at least you did have to wait an hour and a half like some people earlier in the day\". I thought,, huh ok. That was odd. Then she sat us. The waiter was cool and nice and he earned the restaurant the second star, otherwise it would be a zero. The ribs that were on the father's day special came out cold. So we asked if they could be fixed. The waiter said that they would going to get us a new rack of ribs. The ribs came out as a half rack not cut, but were cut by one of our guest. The waiter said they were going to make it right and get us a new rack. Then the rack that came back from the kitchen was already precut the same way we sent it to the kitchen. But they insisted that it was a new rack. The replacement rack wad so dry and not good, so we informed our waiter again. He said he would tell his manager. Three people at the table tried the ribs. And they were dry according to everyone. The manager came out and asked why didn't we sent it back if the ribs were not good, we said we told the waiter and he simply said that he would inform the manager. By the way, the manager was the bitchy rude girl that sat us down in the beginning, Ms Corrine (not sure on the spelling). She said something along the lines of well, do you not like the ribs because you don't want to pay for them. I was like that is great customer service. Make the customer feel like shit because of your crap product and service. Needless to say we will never be going back, which is too bad because the waiter was cool. His name was Eric. Coodos to him and hopefully they good a new manager to fix their image."}
{"text":"Delicious bar food. I've tried the nachos and the chicken strips. They are very greasy but very good. It's a fun atmosphere and I've had good service each time I went."}
{"text":"It's really good! The burgers are yummy and the French dip is awesome! The service is great, everyone is very friendly.  It's always packed and can get really loud. I think that's the only thing I don't like about this place."}
{"text":"Came over from San Diego.. one of the finest brewery locations, to try four peaks... wasted 10 min's for service... while 4 hostess's stood at front door talking.... no waiter, no service.....will only tell people about the poor service....not sure about the beer...or food.... so won't say anything negative about either of those issues, but will say.... the place has terrible service....won't return.... went to the tilted Kilt instead and it was good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past.  My most recent visit, I ordered a pizza. I wasn't a huge fan of the pizza. For $15, I can definitely go to another place and have something that tastes way better and doesn't lack flavor. Just an honest opinion.  Service was ok, but wasn't amazing. It got busy around lunch time, and always does to my knowledge. For that reason, parking is kind of crazy and hard to find something close. We had to park on the other side of the building. Thats just how it goes though, as there are tons of nearby connecting businesses that are forced to share a parking lot.   They do have good beer selections here, and thats my favorite thing about this place.   Restaurant cleanliness 5/5 Food quality 3/5 Value 3/5 Service 4/5"}
{"text":"Four Peaks beer is a decent, local option in Southern Arizona. However, I was under-whelmed by this restaurant/tap room.  The food was decidedly mediocre. The beer was fine, but our waitress was decidedly un-enthusiastic about our presence in her section. My boyfriend and I had planned on enjoying a few beers and the football game, but left before the second half because we felt rushed out. I cannot in good conscience really recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Always busy, always yummy, always offering a wide selection of amazing drinks! I've been to this location twice and both times was happy with the service and food. It's definitely bar food, but it's bar food done well. I ordered the Tap Room Tenderloin this visit and fell in love with the aioli sauce. I'll be sure to get extra on the side next time though. Also, I am not a beer drinker and the bar had no problem making me a custom cosmo."}
{"text":"Good wings. Good burgers. Pretty girls. Good atmosphere. Super friendly people. I am definitely a fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Came here with family while visitng AZ and wow, delicious. Had some samples of beer and a juicy burger. The meat was pretty good size and the fries were really delicious. It was bustling on a Friday night after Christmas and you could tell it was the place to go for locals and slightly younger crowd. Noticed they had an upstairs area but I didn't see what went beyond the back patio where we sat.  Overall, great food, great atmosphere - would definitely come back again when I am in town!"}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed by Four Peaks. It's my favorite brewery!! I went there after work and got their new Lamb Burger. It...was. AMAZING! I love the atmosphere of the place. It's open, but intimate at the same time. It's perfect for both, going out with friends, or an evening to yourself. Whenever you go is a good time to go."}
{"text":"We stopped here after a weekend of hiking, and mistakenly going next door to \"Two Peaks\" - don't make the same mistake we did!!  The food menu is quite extensive including a number of selections for vegetarians (most of the folks at our table were veggies).  Two Peaks had almost nothing on their menu that didn't have meat in it.  The beer was flavorful and cold.  I had the tenderloin sandwich with gorgonzola and arugula.  It was the same price as a burger, but was far superior.  The flavors were wonderful, and the filet was cooked perfectly and tender.  Nice ambiance, typical brewpub.  Staff was friendly and helpful (my waitress suggested the tenderloin sandwich over the burger), the food arrived quickly and served hot.  The noise level is a little high, but that's what busy brewpubs are like!"}
{"text":"So I've been in here before the beer and food is always incredible but today my boyfriend and I had the hands down best experience with service ever! Maggie is wonderful! Super sweet makes great conversation. I'm a little sad this location isn't closer to us because I would come just to have her serve me. She's a sweetheart. Thank you Maggie!"}
{"text":"Jolene, our waitress, was phenomenal!  Food was great, appetizers superb, but AZ.'s loss to OSU put a damper on the evening.  I'd recommend Four Points for  beer, certainly, as well as for food."}
{"text":"I went here after I ate the leftover quesadilla my friends had taken home from here and it was so good I had to go.  I had some delicious chile smoked pork dish with two eggs on it. Wow! Absolutely amazing!  Beer list had good selections although the server didn't seem to know enough about the beers to make a good recommendation.   Rest of the menu looked really tasty too!"}
{"text":"Love this place; great food and friendly staff. I recommend their chicken fingers and would suggest passing on the turkey sandwich. Young, fun vibe inside and has a couple games."}
{"text":"Four Peaks hits two birds with one stone.  Just as I get the craving for a decent beer after work, I remember Four Peaks and its delicious food (garden burger, anyone?)  The hefeweizen is my favorite hand-crafted ale, followed by the Raj IPA (more alcohol, same price, lots of flavor). But the other beers are good and not to be ignored (unless you're the DD).  Thumbs up on the pizza (Mediterranean white, please), nachos (a half order should do just fine), and chef salad (surely worth the price for the amount of turkey, ham and candied walnuts they pile on that pound of lettuce).  Items to stay away from might be the beer bread. I know several people who might be offended by that statement, but the times I've ordered it, my taste buds were unfulfilled. And...well, I guess that's it.  I've also noticed, in the past year or two, a proliferation of trying-too-hard-to-be-good-looking people after work and late on a Friday or Saturday. I know it's Scottsdale, but Four Peaks was meant to be a casual hangout with friends, I think, not a venue for self promulgation.  That's it! Hope my review helped."}
{"text":"So I continue to find that my wife and I continue to give this place more chances and they continue to dissappoint us. When we placed our order we were very clear with the waitress that they continually over cook our burgers and we detailed how we like them prepared. Guess what........they were both overcooked.   Guess what.........they charged us full proce and didn't even offer an appology."}
{"text":"Ok, so I went here with friends to watch the Vikes game this Sunday at 1pm.  It was Halloween, so the servers were all dressed up in costumes.  We ordered bloody marys, which came with very little mix in them. I asked for another shot of the mix, and she brought it.  I ordered wings, which were pretty ok.  Smelled better and hotter than they were. One was way undercooked.  We later ordered burgers, which were pretty ok. BUT the big item I loved was their Arizona Peach Ale....it was insane.  SO good.  Im a beer nerd, and I love all kinds. I was hesitant to try a fruity ale, but gave it a shot. It was sooo good. I highly recommend it. This would be a 2-3 star without that beer. I hear the rest of them are good too, but I didnt get past the peach one!!!"}
{"text":"The visit to this North Scottsdale locale was long overdo. The food was absolutely delicious. I've only visited the locale in Tempe and enjoyed their beer and pretzels but this time around, a date and I decided to make a stop in and try the 'food food'.   The place was pretty busy, due to a Suns vs Lakers game on- but it didn't discount the service what-so-ever. The hostess were very kind, and prompt in finding us a great spot to sit. Our server was also a pleasure and very helpful when it came to some of the menu knowledge.   We warmed up with an appetizer of pretzels to share (FYI:2 come in 1 order) and enjoyed a Hefeweizen garnished with an orange slice. My date got the Arizona Peach ale, which was tasty but sweet, so heads up- you may be disappointed if you order a pitcher.  For the meal, I tried the 'Popper' Burger, medium, which included a heap of fried onion strings, atop of a juicy burger with sliced grilled jalapenos and cream cheese. Seriously soo good- I'm actually getting hungry thinking about it again lol.  There was absolutely no room for dessert but the meal, the bar setting and the service was great. I will definitely be back soon! Can't believe I've lived on this side of town about 3 yrs and it took me this long to stop in."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go here with my husband. New to the area, we are always looking to try to places. Having read good reviews, we were ready to have a good night out. The bartender greeted us fairly quickly with a smile, took our drink order and had it to us in a couple of minutes and that's as good as the service got. She ignored us for awhile and the glass sat empty. She never offered us a food menu, but she did to the people next to us. We asked for a menu. Although, she did know the guests next to us and it was our first time, so why pay any extra attention to us?  We ordered the chicken strips off the late night menu. It was honestly really good. So I really should give more stars for that, but really, I don't think so...  What makes me so unhappy, was not only did I receive lazy service, but we tried this place out during their 'you call it' happy hour. Hmm..,maybe because I'm from California, I have different expectations but even a quick Google search can confirm that a you call it happy hour is, you pick what you want for the advertised price. However, that was not what we got. The Vodka and redbull? $3 for the well vodka and $2 for the redbull. My Hendricks and Tonic was $8. Even my pint of beer was $3.50. I am not the type to raise a fuss, and obviously we already drank the stuff so I'm gonna pay the bill, but I won't be back. We even tipped our careless bartender 20%.   I hope my review keeps someone else from wasting their time at this place because I have definitely been to better bars in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I am not a beer drinker, so this is not rating the beer, but the food and atmosphere.  1) Atmosphere: sweet - great patio and nice bar scene inside  2) Food - pretty good for bar food  3) Hit it up if you are in Tempe, its just one of those places you need to go"}
{"text":"One our favorite local places to go. Mainly for the Pumpkin Porter. ( sure wish it wasn't seasonal) Also $3 you-call-its after 10pm . Good patio for a daytime drink. All of the food I have tried is pretty delicious, especially the spinach dip. Yum!  Locals represent!"}
{"text":"Last night my fiance and I went to this location and it was awesome!  To be honest we had heard mixed things about the service at this location.  The food and beer are always great here no matter which location! But we wanted to try it and we were blown away..the service was fantastic!  We had a server in training (Gabby) and she was amazing, on top of everything and so nice!  We could not tell she was being trained and I actually thought she was the one doing the training! At any rate, four peaks is doing it right from the beer, food to the hiring!  Awesome as usual."}
{"text":"Four Peaks has the best bar food in town. I recommend the Thai Hummus (it will totally blow your mind), chicken enchiladas, beer battered chicken fingers and fries. The service here is usually good but the last time I went it definitely not to par, but I will be back. TVs everywhere to enjoy your sports and tons of beer on tap. Again best place if you are craving greasy bar food to watch your favorite sports team."}
{"text":"Laid back, great beer, and a menu packed with variety for everyone. We sat on the outside patio and enjoyed lunch.  I got the portabella veggie beer bread since I had no idea what to expect from the name alone! Turns out, it is lots of veggies and LOTS (maybe too much) cheese rolled in a tasty beer bread wrap.  Very good, and of course, the french fries were awesome too.  Friendly service, even the chef came out to check on our table (he was yummy too!)  This was the first time I had been to this location, since I'm from Tempe and usually frequent the original.  It was clean and had normal brewery decor, but it's hard to beat the Tempe location with the actual beer brewing gear and old charming character.  Definitely check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible service, I love the location in Tempe but would never come back to this location.  The server acknowledged that the kitchen had messed up our order and that it had taken too long, and that the bar still hadn't filled our drinks and did nothing to fix the situation.    The food was fine when it finally got there.  I had the Popper burger and it was borderline warm.    Four Peaks has REALLY great beer and food, but not worth the wait and lack of service that this location provides."}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer! I have been coming here for 10 years and they never dispoint!  The service is great and the atmosphere is better. Great looking help and a great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Four Peaks is delicious, the food is delicious, THE BEER IS DELICIOUS. Thats it, thats all, its not an opinion, its fact. DO NOT go to yard house. Support local business!"}
{"text":"I always have a good time here if I have the money. You can't get anything for under 10, except for maybe chips and salsa. There's not a lot of vegetarian options that aren't just appetisers, and their \"happy hour\" is a joke. A dollar off of their already expensive beers.   Go to the tempe location.  You'll have a much better time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while.  Their beer is really good and so is the food.  I really like the italian beef beer bread sandwich (with beer battered fries of course), the cheesy garlic beer bread, fish and chips and the az chicken rolls.  My favorite beers are the kiltlifter, hefe, and apricot (not sweet like it sounds).  The atmosphere is cool, but the service can sometimes be iffy.  Still worth it though.  Just wish they had a better happy hour...."}
{"text":"The most delicious club sandwich ever!  Holy geeze oh man!  Not a great to-go place, but to dine in, this place is awesome.  Great beer, great food, and a super relaxed atmosphere.  You can't go wrong by visiting Four Peaks (both locations!)  The servers are super friendly and attentive too.  I can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Simply put its all about service and conversation when you're at a brewery.  I go here often for lunch and have a mix of bartenders between Jessie and Nicole.  Both gals are amazing and super friendly which is great for deciding whether its a luncheon or a dinner ordeal.  I also really admire the GM Marie for making the rounds and honstely didn't know she was the lead because she assimilates seamlessy into the normal operations until there is an issue that needs to be addressed.  The unsong heros are definately the bus boys because they are always on the watch for items that need to be taken away.  I go to both locations often but chose this one to review because I actually go here with the intent to eat and not just drink.  The Tempe location is more hipster and smoker oriented but its a place that you go with a group of peeps looking to fuel up on pitchers so I don't really scrutinize the service or atmosphere as often.  Service is always good and the staff are spot on.  If you live or up in the North Scottsdale area and are looking for either a casual business lunch or a casual evening 4 Peaks all the way.  The food specials are good and you can never go wrong with fresh brew...my favs are Oatmeal Stout, Peach Ale and the Pumpkin porter when its in!!!"}
{"text":"Met up with an old friend for lunch. Started out with a poseidon Bloody Mary. It was delicious. Next we has a beer flight of their 8 regular craft beers along with 4 of their seasonal pours. Paired the beer with a salmon BLT which was absolutely perfect. Dessert was an oatmeal stout milkshake. Always a treat. The service was great and all the staff is extra courteous. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Our family wanted to meet my Daughter for dinner close to where she works and I asked for suggestions and she suggested Four Peaks.  Originally we were going to sit in a booth but the booth seat was solid wood so not very comfortable so we choose a table which had padded seats.  My 85 year old Dad was with us so this was a very loud, busy place for him.  We were greeted by our waitress Julie and she was quick to get our drink order until our Daughter arrived.  We ordered shortly thereafter and the food was brought out by a runner.  They have runners there which is a very smart concept not enough restaurants utilize.  She checked back with us once but in the mean time she had a party of 8 sat in her section.  We were a party of four.  I did get her attention as she walked by and asked her to split our check a certain way which also indicated we were ready to pay and leave.  She instead started to take the table of 8's order.  But wait, she then moved on to a booth and took their order.  We waited another 10 minutes for our check.  Unfortunately that affected her tip with me.  My Dad can't sit for too long.  It wouldn't have taken her 30 seconds to get our check to us then when she was done taking the order grab our cards and cash us out then put in the two orders.  I guess I think differently sometimes.  The food was good, nothing to shout about but they give you so much.  I took home at least half.  Restaurants in general need to cut back portions and then of course prices.  That would eliminate so much wasted food.  This place is definitely a happy hour place to meet friends and co workers.  There were some families with children there as well.  Would I drive all that way to go again, no."}
{"text":"So much fun! Had dinner there Saturday night--service was awesome, food was great, and the atmosphere is one of the best in Scottsdale for just having a good time."}
{"text":"It never occured to me to do a review of Four Peaks, because if you are anyone who lives in Arizona and drink craft beer, then you already know about Four Peaks. They are one of the largest Arizona beer distributora with their beer available almost anywhere. While the Tempe location is their flagship and much bigger, the Scottsdale location has the exact same quality of beer and food. Their 8th St Pale Ale and Kiltlifter are always mainstays, but their food is just as amazing; I recommend any burger and the Chicken Strips, they are amazing. If your new to AZ or visiting, make this a go-to stop."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, great desserts. Get the garlic bread appetizer and the stoutamisu dessert!"}
{"text":"I have a lot of love for this Four Peaks location.  It all started when I moved to Arizona 7 years ago and lived right down the street from Four Peaks and a few years after that it was the first place that I met Paul V. (my fiance).    This was a usual place for my friends and I to come for some food and drinks.  Some of my favorite foods here include the 5 Layer Nacho Dip with Chicken, Spinach Artichoke Dip (spicy), Grilled Chicken Beer Bread with french fries (my favorite item), Portabella Veggie Beer Bread, and the Reuben.    I really like the atmosphere and the service is usually pretty good.  Once in awhile the service can get slow, but overall it's OK.  My favorite beer here is the 8th Street Ale, but the Hefeweizen comes in pretty close too.  If you are coming here to watch a game, come early because it gets packed.  If you're looking for a chill place to have some beer or even food, I'd check it out!"}
{"text":"We love Four Peaks!  Good beer. Pitchers are very reasonably priced during HH.  Yummy food with great vegetarian choices. How nice it is to go watch a game, nosh on upgraded vegetarian bar food, and wash it down with local brew..."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Four Peaks during my youthful ASU days going their after class and for happy hours. I always enjoyed their service, food, and of course BEER. Their RAJ IPA is my continued favorite and beer of choice when I eat there. Site rant: It is a shame that they only sell Hop Knot IPA in stores and not RAJ.  What do I eat there you may ask? Well, my personal favorites are the following:  BBQ Chicken Pizza: Good BBQ sauce and onions that really hit the spot. I actually enjoy dipping the slice of pizza in their amazingly good ranch.  They have a jalapeño cheese burger that I also get from time to time. The name says it all. It isn't too hott, but just right for my taste buds.  The service at Four Peaks has always been above average for me with friendly staff and timely service. I don't think they have messed up an order yet. Pretty impressive. There is a reason why everyone likes this place.  The only thing that bothers me sometimes is that when they are busy, their glasses are no longer frozen or cold. I had one OK experience with a RAJ IPA that seemed more like room temperature than cold, which didn't make the hoppy flavor pop as much.  The last thing, that doesn't apply to the Scottsdale location is parking. Parking is horrible and I have no idea how they can even address that, but it really does suck. Keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Wasn't into.all the heavy food. Cheese everywhere. Fat fat and more fat.  Beer was good.  Is what it is just doesn't work for me. staff was friendly. Just not my thing I guess."}
{"text":"I've been in and out of town intermittently for the past four years, but one thing I never fail to hit up while in town is Four Peaks. I have been here numerous times and this was, actually, the place I came on my 21st!  There are two amazing things about Four Peaks: the food and the drink, and what more can you ask for? Four Peaks makes all its beers/ales in-house and the quality can prove it. Their beers like the 8th Street Ale and Kiltlifter are among my favorites; My house is never out of stock of either.   Had Four Peaks not been a brewery, however, the restaurant would still be worth a visit. Things like their French fries and chicken strips are amazing, as well as their burgers. I have not been adventurous enough to try anything beyond that, however, given the quality of their other food, I would not doubt it.   Four Peaks is a place that is amazing for both its food and drink. I would highly recommend it and would not recommend missing it."}
{"text":"The great service at the front door makes me wonder what to think.. Too bad the bar on a Friday at 4:30 pm has an inexperienced staff.   Maybe they do just do beer here..?  The food is out of this world The prices are great for this city Service doesn't make the cut, I remember a time when it did...."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 but our waitress was totally annoyed by us and the fact that we could not order fast enough. I have never had that happen. I liked going in and seeing the MN Vikings head on the wall. The kids menu was great, my daughter totally enjoyed it. I had a bloody mary that was made the right way with a shot of beer on the side. My husband enjoyed the beer choices. The food was a bit greasy but still tasted really good. We will be back but hopefully we have a different waitress!"}
{"text":"came here for a 2nd time. probably shouldn't after the first time but wanted to give it another shot. Ordered the Southwest burger medium rare. I came with a pound of onion and tomato. The outer part was cooked really good but by the time i got to the center it was raw, not even cooked. completely raw. The fries i dont care for with the breading or whatever they put on the outside. My wife ordered brunch and see got eggs with hash browns and the hash browns tasted old and saugy and had them make a fresh batch. it was towards the end of brunch and probably had been sitting around all day.  This is probably the last time espcially with OSHO in the same parking lot and always great."}
{"text":"Wow , what happened to this place?  They used to have a fantastic menu and now just bar food.  So sad to see another great place change for the worst.   Makes me wonder why?"}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker, but I Iove the Four Peaks Brewing Company's food! My favorite menu item is the Four Peaks Burger. All their food is to die for - Their beer battered fries are unique and tasty - I'm not afraid to try anything new here. I would definitely recommend that you stop in!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, great beer! Friendly service most of the time. great dessert as well"}
{"text":"Best brunch.  Best service.  Best food.  Our 4th year in a row for Mother's Day Brunch and another epic menu.  We are regulars but totally appreciate the red carpet treatment on special days."}
{"text":"I've never had bad food from Four Peaks. The very best thing though... the spinach dip. If it were legal, I would marry it. It's crazy delicious.   The only bummer is, I've never been impressed by the staff. They're awfully haughty for people slinging beer and burgers."}
{"text":"make sure you get the right sized table for your party, but it's all smooth sailing for this best-of-phoenix local brewery. DRINK UP!!!   ...but careful what you eat  it's a LOOONG way to tempe sometimes. this location has just the same short, quick attitude you've come to expect from your tempe staff, but it's all business. i'm ok with that...  --keeping my glass full of that lovely kiltlifter, 8th street or IPA. that's what counts --televisions in every direction, and staff's accommodating willingness to switch to the foreign football/soccer games keeps my european colleagues satiated! nice! --seasonal choices keep it mixin for good times, every time. --chef salad is the best thing there. crispy, cold and fresh salad mix. --fish and chips. frozen, then refried. if it works for you, this could be a good choice. if only the tartar weren't from a vat. --carne adobada had been good, but rice now too salty, not fresh. red sauce lost its quality too. belongs in the list below, but it could be a fluke.   i'm probably not here for the food, but worth noting. # all dressings from the vat. UGH. # chicken wings are my non-favorite standard stand-in-my-own-shit-while-you-pump-me-full-of-antibiotics-so-i-don't-die-while-the-growth-hormones-do-their-thing-in-a-record-76-days-and-then-they-slaughter-me feed-lot fatty shit-ass chicken \"meat\". sorry. # stuffed potato skins. should'a pitched those in the bin, not reused them two days later. blech. # burgers are a miss in every way. ugh. better tasting from costco's stack-o-frozen ready to grill cardboard... :("}
{"text":"I like four peaks, always have, always will. Great beer options, plenty of space, food is always really good."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Micro Brewery in the valley.  I doubt I'll every find a better beer.  All of their brews are fantastic, you can't go wrong with the Four Peaks selection.  Last night, we had a pitcher of the RJA IPA, which was wonderful, but for any first timers, I highly recommend the Kilt Lifter. The food is also top notch.  I've never had anything on menu that I didn't enjoy.  I also enjoyed that it wasn't very crowded.  I went on Saturday night at 7:15, just as the ASU game was about to kick off.  The place had a good crowd, but it wasn't packed.  The Tempe location is probably better overall.  But this is a very close second (and the parking isn't as big of a pain)."}
{"text":"Great beer, great atmosphere.  The food is good with a variety of choices.  Try the soft pretzel & a hop knot.  Great place for watching sports too."}
{"text":"Enjoyed happy hour today!  $3.50 pint of Kiltlifter, Four Peaks' Scottish ale offering, and $13.00 for Taproom  Tenderloin, one of my go-tos here.  (Really need to check out brewery's Tempe location on 8th St. to see if it's just as good.)  Server Steve was cool and amiable.  Just wish takeout portions were just as substantial as those when dining in..."}
{"text":"In one word... 'meh Met a friend there for a late lunch. The place reminds me of so many other places like this. Nothing special, nothing outstanding. The waitress was nice. Again, nothing special. She did one of my big pet peeves - placed my glass in front of me and her fingers were placed very near the top edge of the glass.... you know, where your lips would go. So unsanitary. And this is why you use a straw. Ordered a burger. It was almost cooked medium rare, probably more medium. It was an okay burger. And I got fries with it. I think I had 2, they weren't good at all. They had a good assortment of beer and I love a good beer place, so I'm sure I'll give it another try. After all, they average 4 stars, I'm hoping it's not just the Happy Hour people pushing those stats up!!"}
{"text":"First time in this four peaks tap room.  I personally am more of a fan or the original breweries, but this one wasn't so bad. They had a lot of Four Peaks beers, and food so what else do I need? On and growler refills. On my last visit I sampled the Odelay Mexican chocolate ale. At 8.1% it packed a punch!  For another sample I had a cask dry hopped blonde. I hate blonde beers, but this one was actually good.  I'm a huge fan of cask beer and four peaks seems to have many. That's a real good thing.   Out of the two I took home a growler of the Odelay.   We didn't have a chance to eat any food. I did like the decor of the bar, has a lot of bar space and a nice sized patio. I'd like to try out the food next time. On a side note the service by Tito the bartender was great.  Very friendly and on top of things. I know we will be back here again in the future."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always top notch, this is the only bar food where the food is consecutively good and service is good.  I come here multiple times a week and never get tired of it, this will run Zipps out of business in no time.  Thanks again four peaks!"}
{"text":"After having a terrible night at another restaurant in Scottsdale we retreated to Four Peaks. They took great care of our party of 6 unlike the previous place. I can't say enough about how well we were treated here. Our sever Aubrey is the best and I recommend you ask for her. Thanks Four Peaks!"}
{"text":"This place has great food, service, and atmosphere.  I have been here numerous times over the years, and I have always had a good time.  It is a great place to watch football on Sundays.  Last time I was in, I had a pork dish that the bartender recommended.  It was amazing.  The staff are all very good looking, and they have Golden Tee.  The beer is good too."}
{"text":"Huge portions, delicious food, chill staff. We really enjoyed our dinner here. Would share plates next time. Even the kid's meal is rather large, so don't sweat it if you've got an older child not yet ready for adult sized portions. Great deal on SunBru ($3/pint) - this is a light, crisp beer. Hubby had a hard time deciding what to get (lots of awesome sounding options) and opted for the salmon blt and wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, great place! I've always been a fan of this place and have never had a bad meal! It is always busy, but that doesn't stop them from taking care of you. Any of the beers are amazing, but my favorite is the Peach Ale. They also make a killer Bloody Mary. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but some of my favorites are:  Thai Hummus Spinach Artichoke Dip Italian Beef Beer Bread Grilled Chicken Beer Bread French Dip  All of the portions are very generous, and they also have daily specials which are always a hit! This is the perfect place to grab some good food and drinks and spend a few hours hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Four Peaks has been our \"watering hole\" for a few years.  The food,  beer and staff are great.  There are several \"regulars\" that hang out and it really feels like \"Cheers\" bar.  Most sports bar don't put the level of care into their food, not Four Peaks, their food is fantastic.  If you are a Vikings fan (like me) or a Boston (any sport) you'll feel at home."}
{"text":"This is 100% a great place to watch some good ol fashion football. There's about 20 TVs scattered throughout the place and the volume is perfect for hearing the entire game.  Another great factor to this five star rating is their delicious food. My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday during the playoffs. I had the lamb burger with a side salad. Being a ranch lover I had to try their homemade dressing. 5/5 rating on that alone. The burger was very good as well but somewhat hard to eat since it was ginormous. My boyfriend had the chicken tender. Very good and fresh. A+ stuff!  The service was good too. Very attention and friendly. Overall a very nice find!"}
{"text":"Great service. Food was good bar food nice atmosphere. Great place to chill and have a beer."}
{"text":"Great beer! Good food! Friendly service! My wife and I enjoy coming here for dinner and a pint... or two... or three. We always get fast, friendly service. Don't forget your growler. The food is average bar food. Don't sit on the patio in the early evening, the sun will beat you up."}
{"text":"Came here with the wife to grab a couple drinks.  I tried their white ale brews, which were decent. Wife had some type of sangria which she said was good. We opted for some appetizers instead of a meal.  I tried the 5 layer nacho dip, which was freakin huge.  The chips and melted cheese came out on what looked like a pizza pie tin. The toppings came on the side,  so it was nice to add what you wanted to the dish. Wife tried the edamame, which she said was delicious. Our server was friendly enough, and the service was decent.  We were seated right away,  which was a plus."}
{"text":"This four peaks is in North Scottsdale,we went in for an early Bite and Beer. They have a good selection of craft beers with the Kilt lifter being a popular Favorite. My Husband loves the Oatmeal Stout,i tried a sample of the Belgian white Ale but wasn't a fan.The place is always packed but not too noisy,they also have seating upstairs.  ~Raj IPA $11 for 16 oz.This beer is more on the bitter side with 6.5% alcohol. ~Desert Mirage $9 (four roses Bourbon with peach and ginger,peach Ale). ~Chicken rolls $8 (chile,cheese,sweet jalapeno). ~Grilled chicken beer bread $11 (artichoke,onion,mushroom,mozzarella,green pepper wrapped in a tortilla).  The Chicken rolls were very filling as was the Beer Bread.I loved the dip they serve with the rolls and the bread comes with a choice of side fries/pasta salad/Salad.We got the pasta salad which was nice it's got pesto and cherry tomatoes.  During HH the price of food remains the same,the only thing cheaper is the beer.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Nice local brewery.  Mellow and inviting atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating.  Stopped in for a work lunch and so I was disappointed I didn't  get to try a beer while there :(  Luckily I have sampled some of their beers before :). I went with the Four Peaks burger (w/ bacon because why not!) and it was satisfying.  Pub grub done right.  The waitstaff was attentive enough and it was an all around good meal.  If I am back in the area, I would definitely stop back...the next time with beer!"}
{"text":"Good option for late night food if you're in the North Scottsdale area.  They have the standard type stuff you would expect to find at a brewery- wings, sandwiches, burgers.  They also have surprisingly good salads."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Bombs and can I just say my mouth is so happy right now. Wow wtf it was amaze-balls ( see what I did there?) lol. Of course always great hoppy beer you know this girl is happy and hoppy."}
{"text":"In my opinion, reasonable food prices for large portions of food.   Service was great!   Food was delicious.    Have been here a few times - have had numerous meals.....Have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Consistent quality and friendly service combine with my favorite craft-brewed IPA to make this my favorite place to unwind."}
{"text":"Don't count out the younger brother! Although they don't brew their own bear at this location, it still taste just as fresh as Tempe. Now Tempe's location is the shit, but the reason why I like this one better is because it isn't as busy! The happy hour is still the same awesome prices, just with less commotion. The atmosphere is a lot more laid back and staff is friendly,. Favorite beet: Oatmeal Stout Favorite appetizer: Spicey Thai Hummus and beef nachos!"}
{"text":"Go for the beer.  It's definitely worth the trip for the beer alone and while you're there, just get beer as an appetizer instead of anything on the menu because it's all about the beer.  I recommend the Raj out of everything on the menu.    The reason for three stars were two things: the place was a bit short staffed for a somewhat empty place to the point where our server had to keep apologizing for the delay with helping us due to helping out extra tables.  I really felt bad for him because it wasn't his fault and I can tell that he was as attentive to all of his tables as he can be making sure everyone got what they needed.  We can easily see him bouncing around to everyone and seeing such an amazing tough employee, we tipped in the 25-30% range.    The other reason the low rating was because of the food.   I ordered the veggie wrap and the moment that I picked it up, my hands were soaked in oil.  There was more oil than there were vegetables in this thing.  I completely understand the oil was used to cook the vegetables, but there was an excessive amount that made it not very enjoyable.    Overall, I'd give them a chance for food because the beer and staff made the place worth it overall."}
{"text":"First and foremost, Kilt Lifter is my favorite beer. Going here for beer alone is fun. However, my wife and I decided to have lunch here one day. IT WAS AMAZING! Don't just go for the beer. Food was excellent, we ordered off the special of the day sheet. Mine was \"fish n chips\" but not your normal fish, it was a different white fish, which I cannot remember the name of now... Delicious. Wife got a beer bread wrap, which she enjoyed tremendously.  Staff was super friendly and couldn't have asked for a better way to start our weekend."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Kilt Lifter! Love the flavor and richness of this beer..  Great food too for a brewery. I have tried many things here and have not been disappointed yet. The nachos rock!  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Four Peaks Grille is our favorite brewery & best pub food in Scottsdale! Local brews,yummy Chicken Beer Bread Sandwich!"}
{"text":"I worked with the manager here to set up an event for part of our office and Marie was great to work with and offered just what I was looking for. We had a group of about 40 people on the second level and pre-ordered a bunch of appetizers and had drink tickets for our group. From what I could tell, everything ran smoothly and while I usually go to the Tempe location since it's closer to home, I'll probably make a point to stop in for dinner on my way home."}
{"text":"Awesome service by Maggie today. We had a group of 18 and she was amazing. Pleasant, fun, attentive, and fast. A great experience for our team. Thank Maggie!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch on the way to an event at West World.   The food and service were good, but not excellent. My friends and I each ordered a sandwich and some hummus to start. The thai hummus was pretty good and pretty spicy. I had the Southwest Burger which also had a good kick. The burger was pretty tasty.   Everyone seems to rave about the beer, but maybe not the next visit when we don't have to return to work in the afternoon."}
{"text":"This Four Peaks Location is GREAT, you know why??? Because it has a paring lot! My friend and I have been going to the Tempe location for lunch for years. Tempe location is smaller and impossible street parking.  We came here at the height of lunch hour, the place was packed. We sat outside while Gabrielle took good care of us. We ordered a Rai IPA and a HH Grisette Pint $3. For entrees, we ordered the 10\" Pepperoni Pizza and the Chicken Enchiladas. Everything came out hot and fresh and tasted great.  Great place, parking lot a PLUS!"}
{"text":"we always stop here when in phoenix.  i had a cobb salad of some sort. AWESOME  bob had a salmon club sandwich i think it was, and it looked awesome. the multi grain bread had me dying to steal the second half off his plate and take a giant bite out of it.  we left no crumbs behind."}
{"text":"Four Peaks is probably known best for their beer, but you can't pass up the food.  I hadn't been here in a long while so I dropped by for lunch today and can't stop thinking it.       Looked over the regular menu and then landed on the Daily Specials.  The grilled salmon pita caught my eye - feta cheese, marinated grape tomatoes, lettuce and some delightful seasonings.  Wow - down to the last bite, it was truly extraordinary!  Accompanied by choice of fries, tossed salad, pasta salad or maybe something else (?) for $11.  I picked the tossed salad and was impressed with the variety there too - chopped green peppers, sliced mushrooms, tomatoes, not your ordinary out-of- the-bag effort.  Bleu cheese dressing on the side was just right.  Even at lunchtime, this place is busy.  By the time we were done it was clearing out around 1:30.  Service was fast and efficient, food came in no time, drinks were always filled.  What else could you ask for at a mid-week lunch?  My only small regret is the grilled salmon pita is not on the regular menu.  This one is a treasure that I hope management will consider adding.    I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"The  experience  I  had  was  great  fast  delivery  of  food  and  my  goodness  the  pork  carnitas  wow!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I always have a great time here. We just went out yesterday for lunch and the service was very good. I had a grilled chicken salad, which was okay. My coworkers all loved their food, which all looked much better than my salad! The guy next to me got the Southwest burger and he said he's gotten that before, as well as the fish and chips and beer battered chicken strips, and everything has been wonderful. The fries were thick-cut and looked amazing. I normally get the peach ale when I go but since it was lunchtime, I held off. BUT, I definitely plan on trying the Stoutamisu next time I go! That's right...stout in a tiramisu. Genious!!  Something funny...my husband just told me that my work needs to plan a happy hour there soon so that he can go! Like we can't just go on our own?!?! Ha!"}
{"text":"At this point it's hard to separate the myth and memories from the actual brewery, but I can safely say that Four Peaks is one of my favorite establishments in the Phoenix area. Stop reading this and go experience this Arizona landmark for yourself right now  ...go...  ...NOOOOOOW!  From early morning St. Paddy's celebrations to low-key happy hours that quickly somersault into late-night shenanigans, I can't remember a time when I didn't enjoy being at Four Peaks. The above average bar food combined with the superior beer keeps me coming back time and time again. For food recommendations I'm partial to the chicken salad pita and the salmon BLT, but most things on the menu are complete mouth-pleasers. For beer choices you can't go wrong with all of the options - the Oatmeal Stout and Hefeweizen are my go-to's.  Words don't really do this place justice since it's difficult to drink yourself full with words, so quit dilly-dallying and get your dumb butt to Four Peaks Brewery.  p.s. I know I'm reviewing the Scottsdale location and the original one in Tempe is just better because it's tough to beat the original, but same beer and same food make for a comparable experience."}
{"text":"Love the beer, kilt-lifter. I'm not a beer drinker really, but like this. They have lots of brews to try. The staff is super friendly and they give you samples to try first. The food is really good for a beer place and must try burgers, fries and Arizona rolls with chicken and jalapeno cheese sauce. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've frequented this location for years, but only ever to drop in for a beer or two and maybe the Thai Hummus, a long time fav of mine.  Recently I came to notice that they're always busy, the house is always packed.  Why, I wondered?  Turns out, it's because the food is outstanding!  I finally deviated from my hummus fixation and ordered something else, the pretzel appetizers and the Carne Adovada, and WOW!  The pretzels are perfectly cooked with a side of mustard and cheese, the Adovada is \"cherry wood smoked pork\" in a savory red sauce with rice and beans, about $15.  Honestly, they could charge twice that and it would be worth it.   The beer is always good, and they've taken the time to pair their varieties with their foods.  Service is fast enough (it is crowded after all), friendly, and a often nice to look at.  I'll be back, often."}
{"text":"The veggie sandwich wrapped in beer bread was soggy and sour. Side salad was ok. Water was ICK. Overpriced in general. Maybe I need to try something else on the menu. If that ever happens I will update this review."}
{"text":"Tried one of their burgers (it wasn't good enough to commit it to memory) and a flyte of beers. Really didn't like anything here. The wait staff was pretty cool (some German guy) who took his time and explained the menu very well. He said that their Tempe location was much better (what?)."}
{"text":"On 4/24/17 I went into the Four Peaks / Scottsdale on Hayden Rd. in Scottsdale, AZ to have lunch with my husband and speak with someone about hosting a party in July.  I met with Molly, who was friendly and seemed assuring.  We agreed to having the party there.   I sent invitations out to 135 people.  On 4/26/17 I followed up with an email to Molly  I did not hear back from her.    On 5/7/17 I emailed again.  No response.  On 5/10/17 I called the restaurant and spoke to manager Patrick.  He seemed to know about the party and tried to reassure me that all was well.  He said he would have Molly contact me.  She did not.  On 6/2/17 I called the restaurant again. Molly again tried to reassure me that all was well.  She said she thought she had emailed me back.  At this point we still had not set the menu or the prices.  She said she would call me on the 8th with a menu and prices.  She never called on the 8th.  On 6/11/17 Molly emailed me suggesting Salmon and deviled eggs.    On 6/12/17 I reply that those menu suggestions won't work.  On 6/13/17 I emailed again suggesting pizza bread. I never heard back from Molly.  On 6/15/17, one month before my party and nearly two months after I started this process with Four Peaks, I went to another venue to set this party up.  Without an appointment, the manager sat down with me and we decided on menu, prices and all the other details within 20 minutes.    On 7/14/17 Molly emailed me to say that \"we are all set for your party.\"  Though we had not ever discussed an agreed upon menu or prices.  I am truly shocked that Four Peaks has failed to respond in so many ways to my attempt to have a party there.  And I am DISMAYED that Molly would reach out to me THE DAY BEFORE THE PARTY to say, \"We are all set.\" though we have NOT decided on anything.  I am also frustrated that I spoke with a manager, Patrick, in the middle of this and that did not seem to further the success of my attempts.  I replied to her email on 7/15.  And I advised corporate.  I have not heard from them."}
{"text":"I am a long time lover of Four Peaks Tempe. I came to the Scottsdale location as it was middle ground for me to meet a friend. I was disappointed when I ordered my food and it wasn't as good as Tempe...I ordered the grilled chicken beer bread with fries. The beer was good as usual and the service was great. I was surprised the food wasn't as good. Overall, it was a good experience with the atmosphere and beer! If you want an awesome experience, the Tempe location is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Ask to see waiter Jennifer or manager Chris... Knowledgable about 4 peaks and others in area"}
{"text":"Service was ridiculously good. I think we had 6 different people attend our table of 2. Took our glasses and plates away almost as soon as we finished the food. And, as we were leaving they stopped us to remind us about our to go box... which we literally always forget.  Overall we kept saying everything we tasted was \"good\" or \"OK\". From the beer to the burgers, we were satisfied, but I wouldn't say this is a place we'll crave. When friends/family visit from out of town we'll take them here for the local feel, but not too sure if we'll keep coming back on a regular basis. We always try \"good\" places 2-3 times to make sure so we'll see.  What we didn't like was the not so very cold beers. The glasses were a bit warm, like they just came from the dishwasher and then had cold beer put into them. You'd expect a brewery like this to have cold glasses and cold beer. That's pretty much the only reason we visit the other \"Peaks\" around the corner. Side note: business manager told us frozen glasses ruin the flavor profiles. He also apologized for the warm glasses.  In summary, a place worth trying out, especially if you're a fan of their beers. I had the White Ale and Sunbru, both \"good\" beers. Service was on point, the atmosphere is great, the food was good enough.   The chicken rolls appetizer...go ahead and skip those. Those weren't good."}
{"text":"Great beer, marginal food.  Fish and chips were really greasy and other items were not great.  Loved the beer choices."}
{"text":"I've been to the Four Peaks in Tempe a couple of times and its always been good. The Four Peaks in Scottsdale is just as great. I'm a foodie and a 20+ year restaurant veteran.  If I say something is good then it is.   Walked right in. I love the second floor overlooking the main floor. I know many come here for the beer as that is what it's famous for, but the food is its own reason to come visit.   My eyes are bigger than my stomach as usual but in order what I want Ben if I can't eat it all. Today I felt like chicken rolls and nachos. The nachos by themselves will feed a family of four. I add chicken to the mountain of cheese and chips. All the salsa, sour cream, and other fixins come on the side so you don't have to worry about pleasing that pain in the ass friend who doesn't like something.   The chicken rolls deserve their own paragraph as they are hands down my favorite app here. Jen thought they were bland so I made her go sit in the truck. Just kidding. She wasn't impressed is what she said. Ce la vie. They are delicious. She also had the buffalo chicken soup which I had not had before and received an audible \"WOW\" and an eyebrow lift from me. It was damn good too.   Main course for me, no surprise, was a bacon cheeseburger with pepper jack and she had hot wings. Burger was cooked perfect and the seasoned fries were tasty as well. Her wings were good, not the best in the world, but on a scale to ten prob five them a 7 at least.   Service was great from Erica. Drinks never emptied and anything we needed we received promptly. Jen commented on the ambience and the nice spread of TVs around the place. Great place to come and watch sports or what not. Overall really really great experience."}
{"text":"This review is way over due. I've dined here about 20 times, I've visited for dinner and brunch/ lunch on the weekend. I absolutely love this restaurant. It is one of my favorites for so many reasons! 1. If you are a fat kid at heart that likes great quality food with tasty ingredients, then this your spot! Their food tastes like heaven in the form of food. Everything is so satisfying  and the portions are huge. 2. Their menu offers so many different flavors. American, Southwest, Asian, and Greek. Look at the menu and you will see what I mean. I also love that they add even more variety with special entrees of the day and the specials on the weekends.  3. They have the best beers in AZ. 4. The service is great. They have plenty of seating. They have seating for kids and I  believe they have a kids menu. 5. The food is awesome! Whoever the chef is, is brilliant!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time with a few buddies on a lunch break from work food was good had the peach beer not bad good service place was busy I'd definitely suggest this place"}
{"text":"Great good. Best IPA beer in town. Great wings & Cesar salad good happy hour. I'd give um a 6 as a sports bar. Sit at the bar for best service. Wait staff sucks."}
{"text":"Stopped by to catch some local brews.  Being from Milwaukee, I have high standards.  Four Peaks didn't disappoint.  Steve, our server, was attentive and friendly.  All the beers we tried were great, as were our pretzels and wings.  We were there during happy hour and were pleasantly surprised with our tiny tab.  :)"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch because of the reviews then I felt very letdown. I ordered a lunch special that sounded good and was priced as if it was high quality. Overall the fish was ok, but over all blah."}
{"text":"I can get Four Peaks at any bar nowadays, so the restaurant needs to have something unique to grab my attention. There's burgers, pizza, fish & chips...just about everything you would expect a bar to have, and certainly isn't adventurous. There's no dish in particular that calls out to me.   What DOES call out to me, however, are the seasonal beers. Odelay? I've seen it elsewhere, but it's rare. There were some other small-batch brews that are apparently exclusive to Four Peaks locations. As I used a couple pints to wash down a dry, mediocre meal, I realized what my problem was. The beer is such a reliable selling point, it doesn't seem like anyone arranging the menu really tries. This is the southwest. This is a brewery known for taking risks with novel flavors. The menu should reflect that more, and not just coast on mediocre grub. Fries were rock hard. Burger was ok.   Overall, our servers were so chill I enjoyed my lunch here. And the guy who had shown my friend and I the list of upcoming brews was very upbeat and passionate about what this company does. I wouldn't come here for dinner, but I'd definitely come to have a couple pints and catch a game."}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant as loud as Four Peaks, at least on a Wednesday evening before 6pm.  The room was about half full but the volume of noise was so great that I literally could not talk to my companion without leaning over.  So we left without ordering.  I think not being able to tolerate the environment is reasonable grounds for one star.  If you don't mind noise, the food might be good.  I'll never know."}
{"text":"I had dinner here two nights in a row when I was out on the road. The beer? Mmmm, pretty great! You must try the Kiltlifter - its very good, and tasted even better after a long day at the office. Even their light beer was good as well.   I'm mostly rating this on the beer, because while the food itself here is alright, its not outstanding. Had a burger the first night, which was pretty good. The second night it was the chicken strips, and honestly they tasted a bit weird with the beer batter. The fries were very good in the beer batter and the appetizers decent as well.   If I'm in the area again (which I know I will be a couple times next year), then I'm sure I'll pay it a visit.  Oh yesh, happy hour has $2.75 pints - always a good choice!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and her brother and I visited Four Peaks grill and tap last night. I had never been but I have had and love their beer and my girlfriend said they have amazing food. I was excited to go and check it out. When we arrived our server was very rude from the start. She asked to see all our ID's even though my girlfriends brother was not drinking because he is only 19. When she came back with a beer sample I asked about one of the sandwiches and she again was so rude and had an attitude with me. She simply explained the sandwich as \"a grilled piece of meat with onions cut in 1/2 and opened up\" not sure that helped or made me want to order it. I am also a server so I understand she probably saw us and thought to not even waste her time with our table because we are younger but little did she know I'm also a server and I tip very well. We ordered an appetizer and a pitcher of beer. The appetizer came out and was amazing. As we finished with that our server had not been back to check on us or even see if we wanted entrees. We planned on eating dinner there but after an hour of not seeing her, or when we did she walked by quickly, we decided to not eat dinner here and go elsewhere. We were not asked if we wanted more beer or anything else when she did come by finally she asked if we were done, so we closed out and left. This experience was awful and it will take awhile for me to try this place again, if ever."}
{"text":"I love four peaks. I had taken a hiatus when ohso opened next door but have since grown tired of their poor service. Now I'm back to four peaks - wish I'd never left. Four Peaks Raj IPA is my favorite having a perfect balance of hoppiness, potency, and smooth drinkability. I recommend four peaks for great beer, great service, and a solid menu."}
{"text":"I am from the Midwest, and this is hands down one of my favorite places to visit when I am in town! Their chicken strips and fries are phenomenal! Try them buffalo style, I picked up that tip a couple months ago and won't go back! Their cold brews, friendly staff and patio make this place somewhere I always want to come back to."}
{"text":"Decent food, loud atmosphere (but its a Brewery so expected), slow service. All in all OK, but not stunning.  I ordered the Shrimp Carbonara, it was meh at best. Not enough salt and I expected at least some seasoning. I didn't even bother trying the bread that came with it, my husband did and was not impressed. We also had the beer sampler, this was good. Kilt Lifter by far is one of my favorites here. The Peach Ale was good too.  Now lets discuss Service: We had to ask 2 separate people to get a high chair, and drink refills were like pulling teeth.   I really had high hopes for this location as the one in Tempe was great the last time I was there.  Sincerely disappointing and the atmosphere is not relaxing."}
{"text":"Wonderful brewery with surprisingly great food. The salmon blt is a wonderful departure from the classic sandwich. Very fresh tasting. I recently had a daily special which was a duck breast. Amazing. Well prepared and vet reasonable price at 16 dollars. Worth your time."}
{"text":"Went to this Brewpub in AZ a couple of weeks ago and it was fantastic. So good that we went back the next day. We had the appetizer chicken rolls both times and they were to die for. Hubby loved the beer! Next time we are in Scottsdale, we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Same food and drinks, but older population compared to the tempe location. The atmosphere is more of a sports bar than a brewery."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The food is tasty, the drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are great, and the atmosphere is conducive for a fun time! Bring some friends, order some beers, and enjoy yourself! It can sometimes get a little loud, but not enough to detract from the experience, in my opinion.  Waiters and waitresses are very respectful, fun, and are good at their jobs."}
{"text":"Friday night around 7pm and my wife and I decided to take out her parents for dinner. We didn't know where we were going to go without having to wait a solid 30 mins to an hour to be seated. Jumped on another app to book a table and got a reservation at Four Peaks Grill & Tap at 7:30.   The place is busy! Thanks open table for locking down a table for us.  We ordered a couple appetizers, the artichoke dip and the chicken rolls,they are kind of like an egg-roll but not really, they are creamy and delicious, came with a sweet dipping cream sauce.  I ordered the jalapeno cream cheese hamburger, it came with a slab of cream cheese on it, full of flavor and the crispy onions that were on it sealed the deal.  Great place for a Friday night dinner with the family."}
{"text":"North Scottsdale sports bar type atmosphere.  Great Four Peaks beers but the food is certainly subpar when compared to the main brewery in Tempe.  The advantage it has over Tempe is that it has air conditioning but beyond that Tempe is the Four Peaks to hit."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and I've always thought their food was really good. Much better than normal bar food.  But I just ordered a salad that was a \"special\", not on the regular menu. It was a Thai Salmon Salad. I love Thai and my mouth was watering for the spice peanut dressing!  Well, bless their hearts for trying -- It was basically a plan dinner salad topped with a few strips of deep-fried salmon, Kraft Italian dressing, and a hand-full of peanuts. I guess the peanut made it Thai...  I still enjoyed the salad and the Salmon was delicious, but it didn't do much to satiate my Thai craving."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a friend's birthday party - were we blown away!  We were part of a large party upstairs. My wife and I had the Ace Pear Pint beer. I don't usually like beer, but this was particularly tasty.   We also ordered the freshest Bavarian Pretzel you ever ate, which came with a spicy mustard that tantalized the tongue.  Lastly we had the ice cream cake. \"Fuh-getta 'bout it\" - amazing!!!   We live in Chandler so it's a bummer we don't have one (but we do that SanTan Brewery, which is under same ownership and also quite good), so next time we'll probably hit the Tempe location.  Awesome job guys - I'll be spreading the word about you"}
{"text":"I cannot rave enough about Four Peaks, just not this location. The beer is great, the food is great, but the service is not as good as at the original spot in Tempe.   That being said, the Scottsdale location is also much easier to get in to on a given night. Contrast with the Tempe location, where I've waited 1.5 hours for a table on a Tuesday night. True, it is worth the wait, but after that long swilling Oatmeal Stout one can barely even taste their food. And that is saying something, as the food here inspires ebullience.   5 stars for the food and drink, 4 stars for the service, and I round down (because I'm a bastard)."}
{"text":"Okay, I am typically not a fan of a bad Yelp review just because of one dick move on the part of a server, but I am going to break my own rule here. First, the food here is okay. Definitely not bad, but nothing special. The beer is good. The atmosphere is a bit sterile. They do not sell or give away stickers. Is it just me, or should all breweries give away or sell stickers with their logo and slogan?  But I digress. We met an old friend and proceeded to drink a lot of beer along with dinner. At 10:55, we were pretty well lubricated, and our server talked us into one more round even though our beers were half full (for those of you worrying, we didn't drive - took a cab). Anyhoo, at 11:00, our server for the past 4 hours vanished, and some tight t-shirt wearing toolshed told us we had to finish our drinks in 10 minutes. None of us had started the new beers. No one told us that the place was closing at 11. We protested to no avail. In the end, the frugal half of the party chugged their microbrews, while the other half left full beers on the table. We had to go to the bar next door to get a cab called since no one at the restaurant wanted to wait for it and for us to finish our drinks. Weak. If you are going to close at grandma's bedtime, have a last call to warn the rest of us. And wear normal t-shirt sizes."}
{"text":"Great local bar in North Scottsdale I love their strawberry spinach salad but go hungry because their portions are very large"}
{"text":"Came in to relax on the patio and enjoy a really nice day. They were very accommodating with our request to sit outside, and when another friend came to join us. It was a Sunday, so around 415 they came to tell us it was last call for food and soon after it was last call for drinks. Apparently, they were closing at 6 on a Sunday which seemed a but odd, but it didn't affect us too much.  The spinach artichoke dip was excellent. It came with fresh and crispy tortillas and really soft and fluffy pita bread. Mmm. And the beer was great too. I wish it was served in colder glasses or frosty mugs though. Got the kilt lifter and the oatmeal stout which was thicker and sweeter and more smoother than the kilt lifter."}
{"text":"Just sit at the bar and ask for Alisha .. It doesn't get much better than 4P on a Friday after work..  Cheers!"}
{"text":"The steak sandwich rolled up on the beer bread is awesome.  I had this based on a recommendation by my aunt and she was right.  I didn't want it to ever end.  It was also very well sized, so much so that I had some the next day as well, made great left overs.   I also split a soft pretzel when I was there - highly recommended.    And of course the beer was good and very well priced."}
{"text":"Four Peaks may be great for beer but is definitely a toss-up for food as well as service. The chicken enchiladas were good due mostly in part to the addition of over easy eggs, but the banh mi was fairly disappointing. It's certainly unrealistic to expect amazing things from a Vietnamese sandwich made by a brewery in Scottsdale, but the item was very poorly flavored and constructed. Additionally, the service was abysmal. I often don't even notice poor service or whether certain items take a long time to be prepared, but Four Peaks really disappointed me in that regard."}
{"text":"Delicious French dip that came super speedy! Fries were delicious as well. But the real top notch part of my visit was the beer flight recommended by a super friendly & awesome duo of bartenders. They were awesome & helpful!"}
{"text":"Really nice staff. The cheeseburger was nothing special but by no means bad at all. Had a few beers and they were pretty good as well. I'll return."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite spot to eat since moving to Scottsdale three years ago.  The food, especially the burgers and wings, is excellent, the service nearly perfect and the beer diverse and tasty.  You can tell when a restaurant is well-managed, and this place gets it right every time."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  A couple times when they first opened and just the other day.  Was looking for a good burger.  I had their summer ale.  Light and refreshing but had more flavor than the Kolsch they offered.  Happy hour so $3.25 for a pint. Mmmm.... also ordered the bavarian pretzels... around $6.00.  Was hoping to have some homemade style pretzels, but alas, they did the big no-no and served SUPER PRETZEL, sigh.  Why Four Peaks, why?  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE-LOVE-LOVE superpretzels, but just expected more from a place that handcrafts their own beer.  With that being said, the pretzels were hot and yummy and served with a side with possibly \"beaver brand\" mustard...YUM.  The mustard was the best part.  If I went back, I definitely wouldn't be opposed to ordering them again.    My hubby got the cheeseburger.  Their bun looks partially like a wheat bun--- not opposed at all as it was light and had a nice glossy eggwash to the top.  Not your standard aunt hatties sesame style bun (good for you 4 peaks).  Service was good for a Sunday afternoon.  Got to try several samples and they brought them quick.  The overall experience was good."}
{"text":"Just visited the FP on Pima on Saturday for lunch. We hadn't been in a while, but have never had a bad meal there. The streak continues.  First off, they are not afraid of trying new things at Four Peaks, and I've never experienced a failed experiment. Also, the service has always been efficient, fast and friendly.  Btw...major kudos to them for putting their kids menus on the back of those little magnetic/erasable drawing tablets. Kept my 2 1/2 year old busy for at least 10 minutes - and that's saying something!!   We tried the shrimp and goat cheese bruschetta, which tasted even better than it sounds. And it wasn't anything we expected. Bruschetta is usually some slivers of bread, with a few toppings. Good, sure, but this thing was a mountainous monstrosity of dee-lish-us-ness. Imagine a plate of tacos, but the chips are bruschetta bread, and the toppings are diced tomatoes in olive oil, plenty of chunks of goat cheese, and 6 large succulent shrimp. Heaven, but almost too much!  I took the server's suggestion and tried the beer bread steak sandwich, which was essentially a cheese steak with onions and peppers served in a delicious homemade \"beer bread\" - kind of like a moist, soft, ,chewy tortilla. As Cookie Monster would say, and I quote, \"YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!\"  My wife had the panko-crusted sea bass salad, which she raved about after every bite. And the wife is one of those unlucky-at-food, who rarely gets anything that tastes like she thinks it's going to taste. Even the cheeseburger and fries was devoured by my kid.  For the first time, I didn't try a beer here, but I was sorely tempted by the Pumpkin Ale on tap. If not for the heartburn and lack of Tums citrus, I would have gladly quaffed a pint.  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Great service by the staff and no matter your favorite sport, the games are always a priority when you walk in!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer!! We were there in Feb. (from Connecticut) and stopped in after a round of golf. The beer was so good and the food was too!!"}
{"text":"Just went here the other day after work. The atmosphere was great and the staff was very friendly. I didn't get to try any of the local brews they made mainly because I was driving but I plan on trying the peach ale. I ended up getting a turkey cheeseburger. I was happy they offered turkey burgers since I don't eat much beef. It was a decent turkey burger. I probably should have asked for ketchup for my burger but forgot to do so. The side salad was fresh and tasty. My friend ordered the pizza and I tried a slice of it. The pizza crust was really good and I'll probably go back to try a different pizza. Overall, nice, clean, friendly place with decent food."}
{"text":"I love Four Peaks. I like to try to support Local Restaurants whenever possible, and Four Peaks Brewery makes it easy! Admittedly, I'm not much of a beer drinker, but when we have out of town guests we always stock Kilt Lifter, and they are always very appreciative- so I guess it is good! Anyway, the atmosphere is very much pub and loud with games, and people drinking.   The food is NOT your typical bar food. Everything seems to be made in house.   I love the Garden Burger. I add Sauteed Onions and Mushrooms, a little bit of mayo and it is completely a sloppy, yummy mess. I'm obsessed. The bun is buttered and grilled.  I often try not to get a side of french fries and opt for salad. The salad is always fresh and their ranch dressing is homemade and fabulous. When I do opt for the French Fries I always enjoy them. They are so perfectly fried and seasoned. They are beer battered along with much of the fried goods at Four Peaks. REALLY great fries. I also use the ranch for those ;)  Other Hits Include appetizers like: Bavarian Pretzels- Mmm spicy mustard sauce! Spanakopita Garlic Beer Bread Thai Hummus- with peanut sauce  AND if I didn't have a difficulty with lactose, I would finish the Spinach and Artichoke dip on my own in about 3 seconds flat.  They also have a great Vegetable Beer Bread.  They have a surprising amount of Vegetarian Options, and I know that carnivores go crazy for their food as well.   I highly recommend Four Peaks to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Very nice place and service especially alex she recommends you the best plate and explain the menu professionally I like the place very much"}
{"text":"It's an AZ staple!! You can't go wrong! And when winter hits and they have those seasonal winter brews!! OMG!! that's all I gotta say about that!"}
{"text":"I went to Four Peaks with a friend that lives right down the street from Four Peaks. The service was excellent and so was the food. I only gave four stars due to the noise level but overall the atmosphere was nice!"}
{"text":"They have consistently good quality food at Four Peaks. I prefer the patio at the Tempe location (by far), but this will definitely work for a beer and a solid lunch any day. I wouldn't suggest come here to drink, this location is really more of a restaurant. Though they do have several of their own brews that I can vouch for."}
{"text":"Very cool brewery.  I pay less for good craft beer here than I pay for \"regular\" beer up the road.  Their appetizers are excellent as well.  Staff is always on the ball, and the beer is wonderful!  The atmosphere is very welcoming as well, this place has some character.  Did I mention how good their beer is?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I am not a big sports bar guy and am more of a wine drinker. I hardly drink beer. However the beers here are exceptional. The pumpkin porter, when they have it is great.  THE FOOD.  The food is what really makes this place one of the best sports bars I have been to. Everything is really good. I have tried almost everything on the menu and it is all really good. I can't recommend one thing they are all exceptional. Not your typical bar food. The Fried chicken sandwich is a beast and off the charts good. I recommend it covers in buffalo sauce for an extra kicker.  If you are in Scottsdale I recommend it highly.  Then check out Masteos for a good steak.i"}
{"text":"What can I say?  This is my favorite place in the world to eat or drink.  I don't know where to begin.  At both locations whether it's busy as all hell or dead, we are always seated pretty promptly.    The beer is top notch.  Kiltlifter is my #1 favorite beer of all time.  I've tried them all and they are all very competitive but Kiltlifter takes the cake.  Onto the foodies.  Without a doubt, any burger on the menu is going to be monstrous and delightful.  Mushroom and Swiss is my backup but I've recently fallen in love with the Jalapeno burger.  It's cream cheese, roasted jalapenos (not spicy) and onion straws.  For $9 you can't beat it.  I really haven't strayed away from my favorites (I tend to stick with what I love) but anything anyone has ordered on the menu, there has never been a complaint.  Without a doubt, if you are just visiting for a day or two in Tempe or Scottsdale, this is the place you want to go for lunch or dinner.  It will save you on the pocketbook and you'll leave with a smile on your face.  They also play wonderful music and have lots and lots of television.  I have also never had to wait longer than 5 minutes to sit at a table."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing prices.  The wife and I had the chicken tender basket and man was it good.  Plus I liked that they had large portions here.  I hate when you pay a lot and do not even get full, but that's an issue here.  It's also located in a nice area of Scottsdale.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I had no idea another Four Peaks place existed outside of Tempe HQ (#newAZResidentProbs). I went with a fairly large group of coworkers for lunch. Friday plus our group plus hunger equals a fun afternoon! Thank goodness for our reservation as the place was fairly full that day! As we all arrived at different times, our server continually came up to the table to get drinks ordered and greet us. This girl was amazing!   I've eaten Four Peaks food before so I know the lay of the menu. It's just bar food to me but nice they have a variety of flavors. Everyone in our group was satisfied with the meal- everything was brought out at the same time with no issue.  What really made our lunch fun was the seasonal beer list. Our server made sure we all were educated about the seasonal list, of which all of us at least tried a few. I tried the Black IPA and the GumLeaf Schooner, of which I ordered the Schooner! Both super tasty- I love a good Black IPA (waaay under-appreciated beer style), and the Schooner was mildly sweet. Thank you Four Peaks for creating interesting beer!"}
{"text":"So far the food is great everywhere from fish & chips to burgers to enchiladas. Seasonal beers vary to taste. The atmosphere is nice. Servers are always helpful. A word of advice it can be very noisy on the weekend especially game time. If you're not going to join in the football excitement it can be loud and obnoxious. Other than that we love this place!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast burger but I still think lumberyard has a better one . Good brews here and great breakfast scramble too served with fresh fruit . It's a little dark in here but it's still lively . I say come in and make your judgement :)"}
{"text":"When everything else is closed after 9pm on a weekday, the great beer and the above average bar food hit the spot."}
{"text":"CAN'T BELIEVE IT!  So we are regulars here.  Everybody knows us and our family.  I had just given my daughter her allowance an hour before we patronized Four Peaks for dinner.  When we got home, my daughter was freaking out because she lost her $40.  Fast forward two days ( our average time between visits...  Lol).  My wife and I stopped in for an appy and a beer without the chicklets.  One of the servers approached me and asked if we lost some money last time we were in.  I said yep...  $40.  The manager on duty Patrick Murphy had found it in our booth and held it for us.  Patrick, thank you!  I would say my daughter owes you a beer, but she's 15 so I'll buy one for you.  You are a stand up guy.  Four Peaks is lucky to have you on board.  Thanks again..."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I had the flight and loved 5/8 beers (I'm easing into the beer world). They have a selection of seasonal beers that are flavorful and their uniqueness in crafting beer is amazing.   The food was fantastic and the portions are large! Beware! The nachos are HUGE! Make sure you have more than just 2 of you eating them! The staff was friendly and knowledgeable which made the experience delightful! The ambiance was fun and I'm sure it gets rowdy on a game day!   We will definitely be returning many times again!"}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant and hardly a week goes by that I don't crave their food! An upscale sports bar with better than sports bar food. We tried the Tempe location one time and I kinda felt like I was slumming. I love the Scottsdale location and their wonderful staff. I always look forward to seeing their daily specials because their chef knows food! Great pizza, salmon blt, spinach salad, chicken salad pita and I always begin with the edamame. Yum!"}
{"text":"Stopped here to sample beers, then decided to go ahead and have lunch. So glad we did! The beer was good, across styles. The food was excellent! Ended up being the best meal we had during our 4 day visit.   Chicken enchiladas were amazing. Huge portion but I couldn't stop eating. Hubby had the southwest burger and loved it.  Nice patio area!  Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Can't really say anything about the place that hasn't already been said--great service, cool, relaxed atmosphere, best bar food I've ever had, killer fries, Kiltlifter's great, 8th Street Ale's pretty good, blah, blah, blah. . . it's all true.  Actually I take that back--try the stuffed chicken if it's on the menu. (it's a special) It's effing awesome.  This place truly does have the best bar food. Anywhere."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for food and beer, but the service today has been amateurish.  The server spends too much time at the bar, ignoring her tables.  Then she makes the rounds, apologizing for the \"delays\".  I'm drinking water because she never came back to check on me."}
{"text":"Although we always receive consistently good food and generally good service at either 4P location, today, the 5 star review is solely for the outstanding hostess, Corene. I would give her 10 stars if I could. She personifies excellence in customer service.  From the moment she greeted us at the door with a big smile, she was absolutely delightful. She chatted with us on the way to the table about children, and was very sweet to my 3 year old son. Later in the meal, she stopped by our table again and visited with us, checking in on how our meal was.   Corene had the type of personality that can't be coached or trained. The management of 4P needs to do everything they can to keep her on staff for as long as possible!"}
{"text":"Go for the beer. Stay for the sweet potato fries.   Good beer. OKAY food. Bartenders are pleasant. Cheap beer at happy hour and it runs from 3-7pm.  This location is also 5 minute from my house.   I don't go often but I have Four Peaks in my happy hour rotation."}
{"text":"I, being a tourist, cannot speak of their daily atmosphere or attitude. My one visit though was fantastic. We went here simply to sample their brew selection. The bartenders were attentive and friendly.  We sat at the bar top during a busier time of day, but they handled the crowd very well.  We ordered a beer flight, and it was amazing! Most micro-breweries I've been to offer a 4-5 sampler. Four Peaks offered an eight drink fight. The tray for the beer's was already labelled with which beer was which. Our bartender also gave us a description sheet on the style and brewer's details on each. It was also quite reasonably priced.   I cannot wait for another opportunity to come to this place again!"}
{"text":"Everything here is top notch! Quality of food, beer, pricing and above all else, great staff! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, I would recommend the chicken beer sandwich with the taziki sauce that is delicious, artichoke dip is also one of the best I have ever had. Unfortunately the staff is subpar, I would one star them for the staff but the food is probably a 5 star so you can't completely discredit the place for a terrible staff."}
{"text":"Great place!  Both food and drink are awesome!  Staff is really committed to ensure your experience is nothing but exceptional.  Was sitting at the bar deciding what handcrafted beer I wanted to enjoy prior to eating and the busboy chimed in with his opinion and had a real knowledge of the beers brewed and offered. The food is amazing, each dish tastes like there is real thought behind it.  The only exception is the gumbo they occasionally put on special, it is a little runny and more like chicken and andouile soup.  Not traditional in any way.  Otherwise what a great experience!"}
{"text":"Trying to understand why chicken on half order of nachos costs as much as on full order? Miguel, manager of the kitchen on North Hayden , reassured me that it is EXACTLY the same amount as it is on the full order....what? You be the judge..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The food we ordered was all goo but nothing knocked my socks off. But for some reason their water is amazing! I guess it is the beginning of a good beer so it matters. But in the Arizona heat this delicious filtered water made my day."}
{"text":"It's a brewer with bar food.  Since I don't drink, I can only rate the bar food and the bar food was just so so.   Still, my coworkers probably loved it."}
{"text":"Robin makes it happen! We stopped in for pre-dinner drinks and were wow'd by the friendly service and knowledge of Robin. Amazingly she's only been here a month and already has her brews down pat.  As for the brews, the flight is a favorite and superbly priced at only $10! The bourbon barrel ale could be a little more bourbon tasting.  The double pumpkin was light in taste despite a dark pour. The master pumpkin effect hit on the after taste and was super yummy.im not sure that was the ideal beer to soak in bourbon barrels for months.   Neat part was Halloween in witch (haha) hostesses and servers wore costumes. Robin, by far, was the most practically, and realistically dressed as a homeless individual who wants beer. There was a girl in a Unicorn costume that amused my husband. The matador was awesome and homemade I hear. Might slow her down. Maybe :)"}
{"text":"I might be harsh on this place, but I fully enjoy the Kiltlifer they make here.  The problem with the restaurant, is the price.  I've been here for lunch a few times and struggle to find anything worth eating that's less than $12.  To me that's too much to pay for lunch in a place like this.  The food is good, but not $12 good.  You're better off coming here to drink and watch the scenery than eat."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped in for lunch after running errands. As always, we were seated right away and had food on our table within 20 minutes, not bad for 1230pm! I had a turkey wrap and black bean soup, both were exceptional! My fiancé had the 4 Peaks burger and it was cooked perfectly! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Best brewery food in the valley- pumpkin porter is awesome- good consistent food- lots of tvs for watching sports!"}
{"text":"A-ma-zing!!!! Not only do they have my favorite beer (peach ale) on tap, BUT they have created a craft cocktail which incorporates the peach ale and my favorite drink, the Mojito! They call it a Sip'n'Slide, and it is a MUST order. Along with our delicious beverages, we enjoyed calamari and Bavarian pretzels. When offered cheese sauce to go with the pretzels, the answer was of course YES PLEASE! Omg. The cheese sauce was to die for. Dunking warm, soft, chewy pretzels into the molten Jack cheese and green chile sauce made me want to never eat anything else ever again. I finished the cheese sauce off with a spoon...it was THAT good. I'm dying to go back and order another Sip'n'Slide and pretzel appetizer!"}
{"text":"Ive been here many times and decided to do a review. Food here is always good. We had a first bad piece of food this go around and it was the spinach artichoke dip but oh well nothing a kiltlifter cant fix if you know what im saying. had the bbq chicken pizza which is one of my favorites cant go wrong with that. If your not sure which beer to try if this is your first time at Four Peeks i recomment the beer sampler you cant go wrong. This place can get packed on Fridays but was pretty slow for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Given they have been sold out to AB, I doubt I'll ever return.  As a local business they were excellent.  I will patronize other Local beers, breweries, and restaurants."}
{"text":"Dinner to cap off 2.5 days of moving, good burgers, friendly staff, very busy. Restaurant/bar great atmosphere, outdoor seating.  Only negative was that parking is an issue, had to park a long ways away . Four peaks can't really control that as they're are in a complex with other businesses. My rating does not reflect poor parking."}
{"text":"This place is a little bit hidden.  We drove all over the little strip mall looking for it and it is in the back actually behind Party City across from the Sushi place. The address is misleading or maybe just downright wrong because it's closer to Hayden road than N Pima Rd.    Anyways, if you can I would reccomend either sitting outside on their patio (it has misters in the summer and heat lamps in the winter) or up near the bar.  The dining area just feels a little strange to me.  The ceiling is super high and it's very bright.  That's probably one thing I would change about this place if I could.  Now on to the good stuff.  I started with a sampler to drink.  It's only $9 and the portions are generous and you get to try all brews that they have to offer.  They are all very good and you can try for yourself which one you like the best.  The peach one is tasty.  I ordered the chicken strips and I can't believe how good they were.  This is why this place is getting a 5 star review from me.  They are unlike any chicken strips I have ever had.  They are skinny and curled, almost like onion rings.  The batter melts in your mouth and the chicken does too.  It almost is a bit flaky like the fried fish you would find in fish and chips, but there is no fishy smell.  Just golden delicious chicken strips.  The sauce they have to dip them in is a chipotle ranch and it is really good also.  Overall, these are the best chicken strips I've ever had in my life hands down.  You will crave these.  The fries were okay, nothing worth writing home about but decent.  We had good service and the prices were reasonable too.  The chicken strips are amazing but I haven't tried anything else. I'll be back for sure though!"}
{"text":"Great wings and beer here. Pretzels kick butt. Don't rely on reviews under 5 stars. Great place."}
{"text":"Good beer, gracious staff BUT and this is a HUGE BUT I ordered the chef salad and it came with a dead fly wedged in my lettuce I'm pretty sure I did not ask for lol. The waiter took the salad off our bill but that was it. Seriously? A dead fly....  he did ask if I wanted anything else but come on after finding that in my food why would I want anything else"}
{"text":"I was always a little hesitant to come to this location since I've been to the Tempe location a few times and had to wait what seemed like forever to get a table to only give up and give in to sitting at the bar. Plus the parking is terrible there too.  So we came here on a Friday night and I was pleasantly surprised that we got seated upstairs right away with a view of front door and video golf. Parking is not a real concern here since it is in a shopping area.  Our waitress was friendly and prompt with refilling our drinks and our food took a reasonable amount of time to come out too. I ordered the Portabella Veggie Beer Bread and fries. Delicious! It comes is a wrap like vehicle for your mushroom, zucchini, carrot, sun-dried tomato, broccoli, mozzarella, pesto concoction. I'm not really into mushrooms but they weren't overwhelming and blended in with the other veggies.  It was awesome and more than enough food for one person and definitely worth the price.  I will definitely come back and I forgot how good this place is!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service here. I've been going to the Tempe location for years and when I moved up north I tried this location and wasn't disappointed. The Tempe location can be overwhelmingly busy so I'm glad this one is available. This one is smaller and not as lively but has the same great food and staff.   Some great food to get is their burgers and 8th street chicken strips. The Raj IPA is my favorite beer here and favorite IPA. It has the perfect amount of bitterness. If you've never had their beers make sure to get the flight.   They also have seasonal food and beers which is something new every time you come. Although those items can be a little more pricey than the regular menu. The atmosphere is another component to a reason this place is awesome. This is really a place to remember and a hangout spot to chill."}
{"text":"Four peaks is amazing! They have a lot of menu options and everything I have tried has been amazing! The fries are the best I've had and the burgers are so fresh and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Good beer. Food is like beefed up bar food but tasty. Good setting, good atmosphere. Good good good, nothing great. Local business, did I mention good beer? Service is good, but they get slammed quick."}
{"text":"A Friday night; 1st visit; as we were told, place was packed and loud. Okay, we're prepared for it: yelling to be heard sucks, but we were forewarned. Also told that the place was \"typical bar food\".  Hmmmmm.  PROS: we were seated relatively quickly;  pretty decent beer; server was friendly and took satisfactory care of our table of 8; entire staff seemed like an organized, hard working team  CONS: the food. I understand bar food is not haute cuisine, but 4 Peaks was just blah. Pizza undercooked--literally, dough was still moist in parts. Worse? You could tell just by looking at the pizza it needed 5 more minutes in the oven--why even serve it? Next issue: change the fry oil! Over half our table got something of the fried variety (I really hate bar food). In every case, the fried food had that really dark brown quality, indicating the fryer oil should have been changed after the lunch rush earlier that day! After I sent the pizza back and waived off the offer for a new one or another meal selection, I accepted a chicken strip from a table mate. It tasted as gross as it looked.   I understand why some folks like places like 4 Peaks, but I have yet to find a brew pub anywhere in which I've said, \"I have to return here soon!\" True, the beer was okay (I was drinking one of their IPAs), and I appreciated the hard working staff (BTW, server and manager came to table to apologize for the pizza I sent back AND comped us a pitcher of beer). I accepted the noise and the need to nearly yell to communicate, but I didn't like it.  But at the end of the day, the real issue was the quality of the food--poor to marginal.  I won't return.  Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday on advice from the guys at Go-AZ motorcycles across the street. My girl friend and I are self proclaimed beer snobs and have had bottled Kilt Lifter before and liked it. We ordered a couple of pints and found the beer to be stale tasting...like the taps/lines were dirty or the keg was just old, bummer. We also ordered some burgers with salads substituting fries. The salads were also pretty disappointing as they were obviously pre-made, maybe even the day before and were wilted and the edges of some leaves starting to brown. The burgers were just ok nothing outstanding. The bright spot was our server who was friendly and efficient. All in all this location looks a bit run down, the bathrooms were not clean and the signature offering of beer was not good. I'll stick with SanTan Brewing."}
{"text":"We've been going to four peaks for some time now and we are never let down. The food is great, the service is great and the beer is wonderful as well. Pricing is normal, nothing outrageous. The Tempe location has a better atmosphere, simply because of the layout and all the brick, etc. The Scottsdale location can get very busy but you are waiting in less of a line than you would in Tempe and you can actually find parking at this location.   I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich, it's great. I've had the jalapeño burger before, it's quite delicious too! The cream cheese and fresh jalapeños make it oh so good. Not to mention they have AMAZING chicken fingers here. I don't eat fried food often, but those chicken tenders tempt me every time. So so good."}
{"text":"Four Peaks Grill & Tap is a lot like all those brewery restaurant chains all over the U.S. You have some in house brews and good 'ol grill and pub food in a more family friendly environment. They aren't master craft brewers, they aren't master chefs but in the end they are a comfortable place to grab some beers and some decent grub in an environment that would be better than that of your typical bars and grills closer to the university.  Four Peaks is much like the chains that you'll find such as the BJ's Brewery chains, Oggi's, and others. Much like those, they offer about 8 in house beers, several types of food that just pair well with beer such as pizza, sandwiches, salads, etc. Basically, Four Peaks has something for everybody.  So the grub menu is good. The pizzas are solid and the rest of the menu probably is too.  I got a half \"Veggie\" and half \"Abe Froman\" and it was definitely good enough to have to not have any leftovers. I had some eggroll thing that I can't remember the name of as an appetizer and it was pretty good too. All in all, their food appears to be pretty solid.    The beer, well the beer is just alright. The downside to living in San Diego is that the IPA scene is killer. IPAs for days and hoppy beers in SD will ruin you forever if you go anywhere else. With that said, don't expect that same level of beer satisfaction here. Don't get me wrong, they are still considerably better than getting a domestic but they just don't hold a candle to what I'm used to in SD.  Their Session IPA didn't really taste too much like an IPA and their Kilt Lifter didn't really blow me away. The beer is great to pair with the food and wash it down but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come here for the beer only.  That's just my personal preference only since it seems a lot of locals love the beer here.  The server attending the table was extremely friendly and helpful so I can't knock service.  When all is said and done, this place fits a nice niche in the Scottsdale area.  Grab some good food and wash it down with some beer all in a family friendly, comfortable environment. It isn't anything you haven't seen before but that certainly isn't a bad thing.    This place is still okay in my book and I approve. ;)"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. Drinks are good, food is always quick and tastes great.   Usually go with a group of 5-6 and never really have an issue getting a table, unless it's a big event like a fight.   Head over its a good time."}
{"text":"A PHX standard that actually gets it right every time. The beer list has several favorites, and both the rotating seasonals and the go-to Kilt lifter and Oatmeal Stout are great. Something for every beer lover. As for food, it just keeps getting better. The new version of the portobello beer bread is even more full of veggies than before, and it has just enough cheese and sauce without being mushy. The Thai hummus is spicy and nutty. The spicy edamame are hard to quit. The fries are my favorite beer-battered pub fries, and whatever your order, ask for the jack cheese sauce on the side. It goes great with the pretzel, fries, chicken fingers, etc. If you're looking for dessert, the oatmeal stout milkshake and the stoutimisu (needs to be shared) are the best!"}
{"text":"Will always be one of my favorite breweries in Phoenix! The food and beer here is incredible. In fact, I constantly order their beer at other bars and get it for myself at home. Service is typically friendly and food/drinks come out fast. The only downside is occasional parking issues, having to park around the back of the complex during busy times.  My favorite food here is, hands down, the 8th street chicken strips with beer battered fries and chipotle ranch. My mouth waters just thinking about it..."}
{"text":"Four Peaks is one of our old stand-bys for lunch or dinner whenever we can't think of someplace else to go.  It's not super great, but it's a long, long way from being dull.    Being a brewery, the beer is really good.  I always have the Kilt-Lifter which is excellent.  Lindsay always has the Peach beer and is always really happy.  Foodwise, I usually get the fish and chips or the French Dip.  Both are good - not great, but not bad.  I've also had their pizza which is also pretty good.  Just about every time we visit it's extremely crowded and super loud.  If you're out drinking and looking for fun, this is great, but if you just want a bite to eat and spend some time with the family it's not so wonderful.  Despite it being a hangout for the 20's crowd, this isn't a bad place to bring your kids.  I rarely see tons of kids, but there's always a few and we've always found plenty for our kid to eat."}
{"text":"This location is nice - definitely a better parking situation than the Tempe location. I'm not a fan of beer, but I still love coming here because the food is good and they usually have a delicious pear cider. Some of my favorites off the menu are the Brewer's Breakfast (only served on Sunday for brunch), the Thai hummus (spicy!), and sometimes their soup of the day is a tasty chicken curry."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, great staff. Highly recommend coming if you've never been before. They brew their own beer and have happy hour everyday from 3 to 6 with discounted prices on beer. I believe it is $3 a pint."}
{"text":"I'm really glad North Scottsdale has a 4 Peaks location to keep it real. I tend to feel less and less compelled toward that area as it pops up with more commercial, crappy, generic restaurants, shopping centers and social hot (not) spots. I'm not big on the overall vibe up there for the most part, but I'm a softie for 4 Peaks. This location was equally as tasty and fun lovin as the Tempe joint but not as crowded. The food, the beer, the staff - all consistent with the original. I was really happy we found a spot to actually sit during a playoff game!  I'll be sure to ALWAYS suggest going here anytime I venture that-a-way. I'd take a microbrew and Thai Hummus over a Coors and nasty nachos anyday."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great place to relax and have some great grub. Food is always great which go well with any beer...depending on which kind you like. Don't like beer? They have wine and other liquors I'm sure the bartender can make a drink to your liking. Crowd is laid back and there to have a good time. Great place to watch games as well. They close at 2am which is good if you work late and need a beer to relax you. Cant go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best brewery in Arizona! Nothing comes close. If you are not from the great state of Arizona I recommend you try the Kilt Lifter. But all their beers are amazing! Haven't had one I disliked! I usually go in late night and the bouncers are funny attractive and super friendly! The general manager Patrick Murphy is a super friendly and helpful. The food is always tasty as well. I recommend getting something wrapped in beer bread! I usually do a French dip in beer bread. I promise you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Just like being in an average to sub par sport's bar. For a brewery, pretty darn unmemorable. Quite average beers all around (tried them all). Boring atmosphere. Nice waitress! So much sports this place should probably rename itself. See ya never! (3 stars instead of 2 just for Kilt Lifter)."}
{"text":"Great Food and better entertainment.  Love the beer selections!!!"}
{"text":"Here once a week and it's usually with a group of 6-8. They remember us and seat us quickly. Waitstaff is young, friendly and attentive. Managers are consistently making sure you are satisfied and well taken care of.   Great beers of their own and they also have guest bottled beers - usually top quality as well.   Then there is the seasonal Pumpkin Porter- yum!  Every item on their menu is delicious.. Well at least The 75% of which I have tried.   Wings, nachos, pretzels, carne adovada, chicken fingers, French dip, green chile poutine, salads, salmon blt, turkey blt... All great!  4 stars only because they lack a decent happy hour.. I think it's maybe .50 off pints during happy hour."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a long while because we usually go to Ohso and these two trips just reinforced why.  First time was for a late lunch on a Friday and the service was terrible. We got there around 1p and the place was half empty. Out of the three of us, two of us got our beers right away and the third never came. After we'd been sitting for about 20 minutes, we stopped another server and asked for the missing beer (our server was MIA). He came back with it and said our server was just putting in our food...after 20 minutes. After another 10-15 minutes we finally saw our server again and grabbed her to ask about our food. She played totally unaware that it was taking awhile, even though we're all sitting with empty beers because it had taken so long. When it finally arrived, it was good, not 45 minutes good, but good.  The second attempt was this past Friday evening and although the service was more prompt, the food was not good. We got there around 6p and had zero trouble getting a table. We ordered fries and spinach/artichoke dip and beers. Fries were soggy and the dip was only decent for about 5 minutes, until it cooled off and the thick layer of cheese on top turned into cement. Our server was better than lunch, but we were upstairs and when we were the last ones there, at 8:45p, she told us she was shutting down the upstairs and it was time for us to leave. I get that you want to get out of there, I was a server in college, but there's a right way and a wrong way and this wasn't cool. It's not like we're a bunch of loud party people keeping her there until midnight- we're preschool teachers having a couple of beers and chatting. And it's 8:45p.  Don't waste your time. Go to Ohso- food, beers, atmosphere, and service all much better."}
{"text":"Parking: Unlike Tempe, you won't have to walk a half-mile even after you park where you risk being towed.  But don't expect to park in front.  Food:  The spanakopita I had was unexpectedly tasty.  Still, it's not a place for food you'll remember to come back for.  Service: Good and friendly, no complaints.  Beers:  I really like the peach ale.  It's refreshing without being cloyingly sweet.  I read an article in New Times about their Bourbon Barrel Rye Wine...its really called wine but it's a beer.  9.1% alcohol so they serve it in a snifter rather than a pint.  I know high alcohol beers are served in a snifter but still mistook the online picture as a glass of red wine...so much for my discerning eye.  I call shenanigans!  Seating: The patio doesn't compare to the Tempe location but the place isn't small.  There's an upstairs dining area too.  I'm not keen on the lack of cushions on the booth benches though."}
{"text":"The beer here is unbeatable, peach and oatmeal stout are my go-tos. The food is nothing to turn your nose up at either! Tonight we had bavarian soft pretzles and beer battered fries covered on cheese and green chilies. Both totally hit the spot. I've also jad the fish and chips before and they're awesome! This is by far my favorite bar... if I didn't live 20 ish miles away id be here all the time. The only complaint I have is with the service... the quality is hit or miss. Leaning more toward miss. But again...the beer and food is so good I get over it pretty quick."}
{"text":"Location faces west (faces Hayden Rd. right before it reaches Frank Lloyd Wright).  Modest looking bar with great craft beer on tap, including seasonals that rotate fairly often and cask ale always available on tap.  Food and prices are reasonable, but nothing spectacular.  Highly recommend Hefe-Weizen, and IPA for the hop lovers.  Pretzels are a great appetizer."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They couldnt seat us for 20 minutes even though there are open seats. Waited another 15 for a server. Ill go to tempe next time or just not here"}
{"text":"Since this place is right across the street from Harley Davidson of Scottsdale I come here for a beer and a bite to eat while getting a tire change or maintenance done on my bike.  I have also been to the Tempe location several times as well and both are excellent.  My favorite menu items are the Steak Sandwich and the Fish and Chips.  The French dip is also well worth ordering.   Of course the standout here is the beer.  The best known is the famous Kilt Lifter Ale, and it is of course excellent but you can get that in stores and restaurants all over.  Do yourself a favor and find out what the seasonal is and try it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't love beer so this is purely a food review. We went this morning for Fathers Day and they offered a special menu with about 10 options. The four of us all chose differently so we were able to sample things across the board. The Brewers Breakfast was a nice traditional breakfast, the machaca enchiladas were a solid breakfast with good flavor and the BBQ pork sandwich with an egg was one of the best. Honestly the most surprising meal was the French toast option that I had- it looked wonderful and tasted even better. I love that they don't scrimp on fruit sides or salads. Service was good with a manager checking on our table during our meal.  We will return."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I understand the constant hype around Four Peaks.  It's your typical good beer, bar food restaurant. It is also very crowded and loud. It's good, just not as good as people make it out to be."}
{"text":"First bar that I went to when I moved from Minnesota to Scottsdale 4 months ago. This is the bar that I still go to and love going to, the 'bar' food that has yet to disappoint, and the beer that I crave.  Great times had and great times to come."}
{"text":"Came here in the evening after working out.  It was about 9p (so ok, it was night time) and they were carding at the door.  Since I had come from the gym I actually did not have an ID with me but was clearly 6 months pregnant so they made an exception.  Moral of the story:  Make sure you have your id.  We had a totally cute server gal who was totally helpful and accommodating!!  We ordered salads and burgers and both were excellent.  It was a pretty mellow evening but this looks like a totally fun place to come and have a beverage.  Solid brewery food and would return for more when in the area!!"}
{"text":"Went to The Four Peaks Grill & Tap for the first time on a Tuesday for lunch.  Nice job on the overall design of the restaurant and the staff is friendly and attentive.  The place is obviously popular and was very crowded.  Parking was difficult, but I was seated quickly upon arrival.  The fish and chips were great and the service by Heather was outstanding.  I was crunched for time and she set a world land speed record for getting me in and out.  Thanks Heather!  I am definitely a fan and will return."}
{"text":"I came from out of town but was told I had to come here to try the Peach Ale. It was tasty, but a 4.0%.  They had around 10 handcrafted beers. We also tried the Hefewiezen and 8th Street.  8th St. was definitely my favorite!  The House Bloody Mary was a steal for only $4 and was packed with a forest of celery, pickles, and olives, and well-seasoned rim.  Food was reasonably priced, good for bar food, and VERY large portions. I had the Artichoke Dip, which could feed around 25-30 and the French Dip.  My only complaint was the roast beef was very uniquely dry. I've had a ton of French Dips....but the meat on this one was quite strange.    Seems like a great casual bar to grab some beers and watch a game. They also sell their handcrafted beer to go."}
{"text":"Four Peaks Brewery in Scottsdale is the place to hang out on a Sunday. They have a great brunch selection, good drink specials (try the spicy Bloody Mary) and always a great beer selection. Today's visit was a Bloody Mary (salted rim, by the way), a New Yorker sandwich and fries and a couple Peach Ale drafts. You can always count on the food being good, the service attentive and the beer cold. Be sure to stop by after 12/1 to try the Odelay seasonal, you won't be sorry.  Written by Knife of Knife N Fork/Fork N Knife...be sure to check out reviews by my critic in crime, Fork."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The drinks are awesome.  The food is wonderful. The staff is always friendly!  There is something for everyone on the menu.  I love their home brews, specifically the Kiltlifter!  I really like how they suggest one of their beers to match every meal on the menu.  Nice touch!  I've been here several times and have NEVER had anything less than a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since before it was \"a thing\"...  I came here for the location, stayed for everything else.  Great beer selection (proprietary + guest bottles/taps) Awesome food ... 3 steps up from standard pub grub Location is key ... it's in the center of my bubble Awesome cast of regulars...
