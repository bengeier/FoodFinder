{"text":"So my Fiance and I ate here as we live in the skyview condo located right behind the strip mall.  We were eating for us and my fiance 's mother. When picking up our food the gentlemen was polite but when we brought our food home and found our order was missing an item and we had found hair in our chicken we returned to have our meal replaced, the man was irrationally rude and argued with us about the quality of his food and how long he has been established there. We have been customers previously without much of an issue but this was uneccissary arrogance over a 6 piece meal that is easily replaceable. We will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"As much as I love fried chicken.. This place takes longer than a sit in restaurant. My husband ordered 10 pieces of chicken and it took one hour to get it. Don't bother getting food from here"}
{"text":"The last three times I ordered the 12 piece meal. They gave me once all legs. Another time 8 thighs 4 wings and this time they gave me 6 thighs 3 drums and 3 wings. Argued with me she out 3 ribs and 1 breast in. Well you better go back to chicken school and find out what a rib is because it ain't a thigh. Rippers done with them."}
{"text":"This is a very family run place right now, with fast convenient food that is also delicious. For the price, you can't beat it."}
