{"text":"Love pike inn! Grew up visiting this place. Great breakfast food and lunch. I always get either an omelette or the steak hoagie which both you can't go wrong. Friendly staff and environment."}
{"text":"Great local diner w/ 50's feel and atmosphere. Nice place for breakfast or lunch. Folks are friendly and if you enjoy a local diner then you should put this on your list of places to check out."}
{"text":"I  have  eaten  there quiet a few times. Everything was very good !! But I  thought  it  was closed or up for sale????"}
{"text":"Great local diner! Stopped here for breakfast while in town for work, had the Italian Sizzler, which was excellent.

All the food is cheap and everything on the menu looks good. Friendly staff, neat decor, would definitely recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"not a bad joint.diner food, great breakfast items, great country fried steak.mash gravy..good stuff, not too cheap, nice dining scene. try it you will dig it. i will and have gone back"}
{"text":"Shelly's Pike has always been one of my favorites. Growing up, my nana and I always came here after Sunday morning church. Coming back 6+ years later, I still feel all of the homey & friendly vibes I felt back then. The service is fast, the food is hot, and the coffee is amazing. 
I ordered the Grilled Turkey bacon & Swiss sandwich and it was great! The only suggestion I would make is to not make it so buttery. 
My boyfriend got over easy eggs and they were cooked to his standards (which is hard to come by). 
The meals are slightly overpriced, but IMO, it's worth it. 
I always loved Shelly's Pike & I always will"}
{"text":"Look, they serve home cooked American diner food, and they do it in a nice way, in a clean environment.  They are down -home, not gourmet.  I like gourmet.  I like bread that has a crust and is chewy. You get soft, American-type here.  However, it is all reliable, clean, tasty and the staff is so pleasant, you're happy to find such a non-chain, local clientele place while on the road. I had a nice omelet, and my friend had three sausage patties (!). The coffee was good coffee.  No lattes, soy or any of that.  It does what it says with good cheer, good service, and nice warm food.  That's plenty."}
{"text":"To be fair, I've only ordered one thing here. The breakfast special, eggs, sausage or bacon, potatoes and toast, and it's about $7. It's always done very well. I have heard people tell me that they've ordered lunch or dinner entrees here and have been less than pleased. So, go here for a simple breakfast, and you will most likely come out with a smile on your face. It's a small-town, unpretentious feeling. But it's not a dump. It's clean and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. I have received better service and food at fast food restaurants and that's really sad. The so called fresh cut pub fries where battered frozen fries. The cheeseburger was a frozen patty. The food I would have rated as one star, the service... yelp does not have negative rating my waitress truly deserve. My waitress  did not care. I had a one glass of water, because she never checked in on how my meal was, and if I needed a refill. I had to ask another staff member for my bill. This was the worst dining experience I had since I can't remember when."}
{"text":"Great local spot for breakfast---all traditional breakfast entrees and sides served by warm, genuine cheery wait staff.  They have lunch and maybe dinner.  I have only been for breakfast and I am a fan"}
{"text":"A good place for your typical diner breakfast. The restaurant is clean well lit from large and plentiful windows. The decor tries to evoke 50's nostalgia with 45's and murals adorning the walls. They have counter service as well as tables and booths. It is a good place for groups to meet. They don't mind if you slide a few tables together and separate checks are not a problem. The food is fine and the service is fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for Diner fare, eat here with confidence."}
{"text":"Make a special trip for the ho ho cake! I did this afternoon, it's unfortunate my waitress had absolutely no interest in waiting on me today. Never checked back to see how my meal was and delivered my cake with no fork. Decided to stand up and get it myself since I knew I'd be in for a wait. As a chronic over-tipper, it's not often I have to use a calculator to figure a tip. The other waitress and bus boy were quite attentive!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there this morning to support a local business. I understand when a place is busy but our order was forgotten. 3 tables that arrived 10-15 minutes after we did received the same meal we ordered within 8 minutes. Our meal came 25 minutes later and only after we asked our server where are meal was. We could easily see her the whole time and she never once checked on our order from the window yet didn't realize she delivered another tables order before ours. The food was cool (not hot so it must have sat for a while). When asked if everything was OK and we said \"no\", nothing more was said or asked. Food wan't that great just basic eggs an toast definitely not worth the extended wait. Bad service"}
{"text":"My husband and I took our 2 month old here for breakfast one morning. This is a cute little diner with a down home vibe. The service was friendly and attentive and the food was dynamite! I had French toast and my husband had a mixed grill scramble with Italian sausage. The side of homefries made the meal - we both left happy and satisfied. 
I've heard that this is more of a breakfast spot, but I'd be willing to go back for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"If you were here on Black Friday morning  (11-25) and it was really  busy I'd like you're  feedback on how it was. I was one of the two cooks there. How'd we do?"}
{"text":"Surprising gem of a traditional diner. You can get a good breakfast here or an excellent meatloaf plate. Wholesome food and friendly service. 

It's nothing fancy but quite charming, and a good value. It's the kind of dependable place you will want to come back to. 

Make sure you leave time to check some of the photos on the wall. This place has been around for a long time and continues to remain someplace special."}
{"text":"Every time I have been to Shelly's it's been a great experience. If you're looking for good, local, home cooked food I would highly suggest this place. The waitresses are sweet and very attentive. Their food is great, LARGE portions.. and very inexpensive! Also, their milkshakes are hand spun and delicious! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with the other mixed reviews about the Pike Inn.... this place is like less than 5 mins away from my house, so we do come here often.... because of the convenience, not because of the amazing food lol. The food is basic, but the place is clean, the staff is friendly, it's very reasonably priced, and there is always an open table. Give it a shot. Not the best meal you'll ever have, but it's good!!"}
{"text":"Unique local diner with a great atmosphere.  Decent food and good service. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Where to start... I never honestly would have thought to say that I would pick fast food over any place but shelley's  pikes inn is the exception to that rule. If your regular your treated warmly, if not do not even waste your time or money. Wait staff is the fakest unprofessional excuse for humans I ever meet. On to the meal cheeseburger and fries.The \"fresh cut pub fries\" where frozen battered fries. Now on to the burger, frozen patty no seasoning, I had better tasting burgers at McDonald's. The waitress did not check in at all and did not refill my water glass. Overall, if I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Our waitress Joann was the best very friendly and fast! The food was delicious hot and came out very quickly. The restaurant including the bathrooms were very clean and decorative! Definitely recommend and we will be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this diner. I go whenever I have off as often as I can. I've only gotten breakfast but it's amazing. Their pancakes are the size of their plates, if not bigger! I get the omelets a lot because they're cooked perfectly to me. I've also had the chocolate pancakes and they offer specials which are no more than $7 for a ton of food! So much food for what you pay! It's a great diner for anytime with anyone!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this little gem on the way home from the outlets. Steak salad was amazing. The fries reminded me of the old potato patch fries from kennywood. Would recommend to anyone just looking to grab a bite to eat. Reasonable prices & great service."}
{"text":"I have so many favorite meals that it's really hard to choose just one! For breakfast, I love their typical breakfast special or their stuffed French toast. For lunch, can't go wrong with a fish sandwich, fries and coleslaw, or their tuna melt is great!! For dinner, let's see: country fried steak, meatloaf, hot sandwich with gravy. All good. Home cooked meals that you get your money's worth for. Don't forget about the HoHo Cake for dessert, also homemade!"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent flier at the Pike Inn. It's reasonable, their homemade product is good and they make a great omelette that's not brown and over-cooked.

They make a good meatloaf with gravy. Their fresh cut fries are very good, they somewhat remind me of Potato Patch fries from Kennywood. 

Service is always attentive and your food arrives quickly. 

It's a diner, expect diner food. As I said their homemade product is good, a lot of other items are not homemade. I enjoy it for breakfast primarily, stop on for lunch on occasion and once in a blue moon hit it for a quick dinner if I'm in the mood for it.

I'm a huge fan of the decor and the building itself. I like how it is all stainless steel paying homage to the diners of yesteryear. I wish there were more places like it. 

It's a Canonsburg staple. Worth checking out.

I'd like to point out there are two reviews which question the French fries. Pike Inn has both frozen battered fries and fresh cut fries. ***Make sure to ask for the fresh cut fries.***"}
{"text":"We wanted a quality breakfast in a unique song quoth good service. It appeared when we got there that Fujii is a local favorite.  The convivial atmosphere made the atmosphere warm and friendly.  Now to the food .. we created or own buffet including a specialty blueberry pancake, crispy bacon, and the meals.  Mine was the Italian grille, a scramble served in a fajitas style dish. It was delicious and perhaps a little too much as I had to ask for a togo box. The blueberry pancake was stuffed with real plump berries.  Yum. And the coffee kept flowing.  We got exactly what we expected and you couldn't beat the price."}
{"text":"I decided to stop here being my normal go to breakfast spot was closed and I'm happy I did. On entering me and my guest where not greeted but where quickly approached at our table. I was impressed with the size of the menu as well as some of the things they offered. I was even more shocked to see they serve beer and wine. After glancing over the menu there pricing is a bit high for what your getting. I also wish they would offer single slices of French toast to add on to your meal being I don't wanna pay 6 bucks for a French toast meal for one slice with my eggs. But I ended up just not getting it and want with the breakfast special. I got two eggs sunny side up now they where a bit over cooked, rye toast that being a fresh taste but way overly buttered, and the home fries I have to say where the best I've ever had. They where perfectly cooked and where very crunchy just the way I like em! Service was good and the waitress made sure everything was fine. Another tip of what I wish they would offer is a breakfast special for the early birds there before 9am. Overall I will be returning here to get the home fries again."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place! But today we tried their famous fish dinner. Best fish sandwich I've had in a long time. Excellent!!"}
{"text":"It is good for what it is... Diner food.  Clean, friendly staff and good basic food.  Great for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Love this local family diner. Owners are very kind and food is so good! I always stick with the spaghetti w/ meat sauce. Sweet tea is also very good."}
{"text":"So this place wasn't horrible nor was it super fantastic. It has a nice classic diner atmosphere and some good food. I had the homemade waffles and they were delicious! The coffee was like all watered down and just not that great and the waitresses were all confused as where to go and where orders were going, seemed like there was a lot of chaos and no cohesion amongst them."}
