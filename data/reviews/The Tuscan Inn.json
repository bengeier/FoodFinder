{"text":"My wife and I ate here on Halloween. It was our first time trying their new fall menu. Do yourself a favor. Stop reading my review and get in your car and check this place out!  Hands down the best food in the area. The flavors are bold, the presentation is charming and the atmosphere is delightful. You owe it to yourself to give this restaurant a go.  My wife had the lamb. It was big in both flavor and size. I had the duck, it was creatively done both visually and in taste. Absolutely fantastic! We cannot wait to go back. If you are looking for a quality meal that will deliver, look no further.   What are you waiting for? Go!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at the Tuscan Inn last evening and had a fantastic experience.  The atmosphere is charming, warm and inviting.  Everything was exceptional from the food to the service.    We had the  vegetable primavera with chicken (they gave us a shrimp option as well) and it was exceptional. The veggies were lightly sautéed - not mushy and the chicken was very tender and  flavorful.     We also had a great beet salad that was just the right size and although we rarely get dessert - we were tempted when we saw the berry ricotta cake on the menu......it did not disappoint!  Almost forgot to mention the great wine choices. We would recommend the Tuscan Inn to anyone."}
{"text":"It is a true pity when ownership changes cause a restaurant to go down hill. This place used to be worth the money, now, not so much. The owners seem disconnected, uninterested and not the least bit concerned with the state is the place.  After an epic fail last night with truly uninteresting food, subpar service and a forgotten birthday request tootle-loo, I will not be back."}
{"text":"We visited Tuscan Inn last evening for a farewell dinner with some old friends. The service was attentive but not overpowering. The menu was limited but covered all the bases. The soup of the day, a zucchini garlic, was outstanding. We enjoyed the salmon dish, the rabbit pot pie, and the evenings special crabmeat ravioli. All were very good. The wine list was well balanced and not over priced.  Definitely worth a trip. Our friends from the area will make this a regular visit."}
{"text":"Been a favorite spot for us for years. My party of 5 was unanimous in disappointment. We're told new chef and owners were retooling menu (again) and gone is the wonderful \"Stans Wine List\" replaced with what is a shadow of what used to be. At 7:00 four entrees gone including filet. Filet!?  Will give em one more chance. This was strike 2. So sad. But I'm hopeful."}
{"text":"First time at Tuscan Inn after the occasional drive by over the years.  Food was well prepared and in generous sized servings.  Decor and atmosphere more neighborhood upscale than fine dining. Had a reservation and seated quickly but was long time until waiter stopped by our table; but from then on service was great.  Little things, such as dirty, small trash can out in viewing area.  Overall:  food is five stars and worth the price while atmosphere is three stars."}
{"text":"We went to Tuscan Inn for a Saturday night dinner and we were extremely impressed with the amazing food, large menu and healthy portions. They were super accommodating for a gluten allergy and the staff and owner were genuinely personable and helpful. We loved the wine selection and we even bought a imported bottle of wine to take with us.  The atmosphere was quiet and intimate and we will absolutely be coming back to enjoy the fall menu.  Oh and the bread is unbelievably good too!"}
{"text":"I was visiting family in the area and we wanted to try a locally owned restaurant. We found out from locals that the restaurant is under new ownership as the previous owners had retired. When we walked in (without reservations), we were greeted like family. The new owner was there and personally escorted us to a table. All of the tables are tucked in and cozy. No herding into a large, cacophonous room and forgetting about the personal touch...no indeed; just the opposite! The table suited our large party to a tee, and we could hear each other talk! We ordered many things from the menu. I don't remember the Italian names but I had the pasta with wild boar; my husband had the duck, my seventeen year old son had the lasagna; my mother had the vegetarian pasta, my daughter had the salmon and my son-in-law had the short ribs. The chef prepared a special dish for my two year old granddaughter (pasta with butter sauce and sautéed vegetables). We ordered two bottles of wine and we were very pleased with the quality and value! We decided to share desserts...creme brûlée, chocolate lava cake, tiramisu and cheesecake. Everything was unique, delicious, and beautifully presented! The service was kind, attentive, friendly, and thorough. It was a lovely, relaxing, and memorable evening. The new owners are very anxious to please and to win your loyalty. Next time that I am in town, you can be sure that I will be back!"}
{"text":"We went to the Tuscan Inn last night with two other couples and were blown away at how good it was.   The place has a small intimate feel and an open hearth adds the perfect touch.   We ordered a few appetizers but the roasted garlic and flat bread was especially good.   For dinner, a few of us ordered the Risotto di Mare which is risotto with a variety of seafood.  I am a big fan of risotto and it was amazing - easily the best dinner I've had at a restaurant in the past year.  Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their meals as well (my wife ordered the salmon and she said it was awesome).  Overall it was a great experience, including the service which was spot-on.  I couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"Food is above average. Atmosphere is nice. Service was adequate. Those are the pros.   Cons???  Dishes are slightly pricey for their size IMO. The wine prices are worse. I understand there is a mark up, but they seem to take advantage here. We brought our own, and even the corkage fee I found to be a little rediculous...as in 7x as much as the nice Italian restaurant in Bloomfield I find myself sitting in as I type this. Especially on a $400 bill, you think they might drop one cork charge as a courtesy or something.  And how do you run out of meatballs?!?!  All in all I like the place, and would go back sparingly when circumstances dictated."}
{"text":"Service:  AMAZING!  Waitress knew the menu and the wine like the back of her hand.  Dirty dishes were removed almost immediately.   Food:  Every single thing we ate was amazing.  Appetizer:  Flat bread, roasted garlic, fresh mozzarella= AWESOME.  Butternut squash ravioli = So full of flavor and delicious.  Walleye special = my fiance ate every single bite.  Price:  $100+ tip for the 2 of us.  A little pricey for a casual friday night dinner but the excellent food and service helped east the sting. ;)"}
{"text":"Tuscan Inn is a city caliber restaurant in the suburbs.  Top notch food and good service.  The wine list is a little light, but you can find some gems on there as well, especially on the owners reserve list.  Each of those are rated 90 points or higher at varying prices.  Some decent finds for a restaurant of its size.  The sea scallops and the veal chop were our entrees and we could not find one thing we did not like about the preparation, presentation or taste.  They were wonderful and I would recommend either.  The house salad (which is fantastic with the optional additional Gorgonzola crumbles) comes with most entrees.  A nice treat in a higher quality restaurant these days.  They self professed their Cabernet Vinegarette was \"famous\" and the best.  I now agree.  The service was good, not great.  I missed our waitress' name and I regret that as I  would ask for her again.  The place was packed yet the attention was just right.  It would have been too little had we wanted to get out of there sooner, but since it was a special evening, and no kids, we enjoyed each other and the length of time.  The service lacked the \"little things\" like clearing plates before the next course (they sat awhile) and fresh forks and knives with each course (unless you asked).  That is knit-picking but one of the differences between 4 and 5 stars.  Overall, a great place, a good find and recommended.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Pasta was incredible in such a nice atmosphere with excellent service! Sin cake was well worth the calories!"}
{"text":"Seafood risotto was rich, but really yummy! Deserts aren't anything special (nice presentation but no real flavor)."}
{"text":"Have been to this place perhaps 10 times over the last 15 years, so definitely familiar with it. Had not been here  for perhaps 3 years. Last left off where my opinion was, \"hmm overpriced wine but they have some nice appetizers and flatbread\" . Let's give it a shot for a couple o glasses and their great charcuterie plate.  Well, the wine list got pricier, yet the quality no better, nothing on the list less than 12 dollars and some at $20.   The charcuterie plate, comes in for 2 or for 4 people size options. The waitress asked the two of us if we wanted the 2 or four people option. Strange we thought, do we look like we are big eaters or  very hungry. When it arrived I see why she asked, it was tiny  consisting of a few pieces of what looked like your local super markets sandwich meat some small pieces of asparagus hearts. All of this on a skinny rectangular plate not the large plater of times past.  The collective opinion on seeing and sampling was one of \"Seriously!\" For $15 this was an affront.   The flatbread instead of the fresh baked warm stuff of the past was somewhat stale very overly salted clearly yesterdays flatbread. Not even warmed up to fake fresh.  We'd planned on getting the stuffed banana peppers as they were a saving grace of the past, but this slap in the  face app combined with the wine list consisting of nary a bottle under $46 on the red side, once again prompted views of \"What are they thinking\".  We then looked at one another and said \" What's plan B\" and departed for what turned out to be a good experience in another North Hills place.  Additionally  the wine was served at a \"flabby temperature\" Not that I'd mention for a run of the mill place, since all but fin dining places typically do not serve at the right term it but if you are going to have $20 by the glass wines and greater than $100 on the menu bottles you should perhaps understand the concept of serving at the correct temperature."}
{"text":"By the name you could safely guess this is Italian cuisine. My wife and I were both pleased with our dinner here. The food was much better than Olive Garden or Bravos. Even though it was on the expensive side we felt it was worth it. We enjoyed the Formaggi (assortment of cheeses) as our appetizer. Entrees were prepared well and although we didn't have any there is a good selection of wine to choose from.   The ambiance was nice - an older style European theme. It was busy and a little crowded during the evening that we were there. Overall this is a good place to visit if you're looking for something a little different or a nice night out."}
{"text":"We recently revisited the Tuscan Inn, it's been years since we've dined there.  The decor was always rustic, now it's a bit shabby, but impeccably clean and cozy.  Our wait staff was excellent -  attentive, helpful and friendly.  The Antipasti platter was the perfect beginning.  We devoured the pickled onions, shrimp and baby artichokes. Of all the entrees we tried, the wild boar really stood out.  The fillet and duck were also delicious.  Desserts were okay, most not house made but still passable.  My big complaint was with my Caesar salad.  The lettuce was not fresh, some of it was actually discolored.  All in all, I'm not sure I'd travel out of my way to return, but a good choice if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love Tuscan Inn. The food here is so good. Like, we're talking \"this would be a competitor for my last meal\" good. It's admittedly also somewhere you could easily spend a ton of money on dinner - if your group is big enough, you'd drop a couple hundred dollars here without any difficulty. But it's absolutely worth it for a special night out.  So far I've been here twice, once for a sampler event and once for a full meal. The sampler was just so wonderful that I had to come back and eat more. I ended up visiting with my family to celebrate my upcoming birthday. And for the most part, the full meal did not disappoint.  Firstly, this place has one of the best foreign wine menus you'll find in the area. I splurged and had a couple glasses of wine during my meal here specifically because you can't easily find Argentinian wine anywhere else within the greater Pittsburgh area. So right off the bat, this place started off with a big thumbs up.  And as I said earlier, the food is just excellent. During my meal here my family and I shared a fig, beet, and cheese flatbread that was just perfect - it had a little touch of dressing, the right amount of crunch and an absolutely delicious blend of flavors that made for a not-too-sweet-not-too-bitter appetizer. No complaints about the salad, which was green and leafy and not drenched in dressing - just how I like my salads. For my main course I chose the lobster ravioli, which came with a huuuge tray of sauces that I admittedly barely touched - the ravioli really didn't need that much extra flavoring, as it was just flavorful all on on its own. But the sauces I did try were quite interesting and good as well. I also sampled the duck and braised short-rib when my family members traded bites of our food, and oh man - yum! That duck in particular was a little bite of heaven. I would absolutely order that during a return visit.  Really, the only issue we had at all during our meal was the delay it took for our main meals to arrive. Our dinner reservation was for 6:30pm, and for about an hour things progressed at a normal pace. Unfortunately, something happened in the kitchen that resulted in our table seeing absolutely no food between 7:30 and 8:00. Granted, we weren't starving thanks to the appetizers and salads that had arrived throughout the previous hour, and it was clear that what was happening had nothing to do with our attentive and apologetic waitress, but the amount of time we were delayed by was still pretty significant. We were at least comped dessert as an apology (chocolate cherry cake - a rich and decedent dessert that added an amazing touch to an overall excellent meal) and it didn't spoil the evening at all, but it was still a good thing that we didn't have any timely plans for after our dinner.  Delays or no delays, I will continue to love the Tuscan Inn. I also probably won't be here for at least another year. Or two. Because good food or not, those prices just aren't in my normal budget. But I guess those prices and the amazing quality of the food here are exactly what make Tuscan Inn such a great special occasion dining spot."}
{"text":"I visited the Tuscan Inn for the first/last time on Valentine's Day. The menu was decent and they had some Valentine's Day specials. My boyfriend and I both chose meals off the normal menu. The meals were good, but not outstanding. Both meals were over $18 and neither came with a side. Mine was a vegetarian pasta meal, his was seafood.   The building is cute. It's small and intimate. We were told the dress code was no jeans when we made the reservation. We arrived dressed nicely, to find half the people there wearing jeans! Not sure if it was us or them who wasn't following the normal dress code :)   A sidenote- we noticed a definite attitude change when the wait staff was serving us vs. other patrons. I'm assuming this is because we were a young couple in an expensive restaurant... maybe they didn't expect us to spend money or tip well or something? We both got soda and water to drink with our meals. For whatever reason, I felt like that set a bad tone for the rest of the meal (when it absolutely should not have). We planned on drinks and dessert here after dinner, but obviously decided against it.  I feel there are a lot more restaurants close by where you could have a more enjoyable meal for a more reasonable price and a much friendlier atmosphere. It's by no means a bad restaurant, just not for us."}
{"text":"Have driven by many times and always wanted to check out - so I stopped in on a Saturday evening for a drink. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Ordered a glass of Chianti at the bar. Wine was rather ordinary and had turned stale. When I got the bill I was astounded - $18 !! Since I thought I had the wrong bill I asked the bartender - and she confirmed the price. Live and learn - last time I will go there!!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING dinner on Friday evening 8/28/15. We entertained a special guest and everything was superb!"}
{"text":"My son and his girlfriend were out visiting. The food was delicious and about $30 per plate. The ambiance was quiet. The service was great."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  The customer service impeccable.    Started with the appetizer roasted garlic which Joey, our waitress, taught us how to eat.  My wife had the butter squash ravioli which was her style.  It was heavy enough to fill her up but didn't make her unbutton to make more room;)  I got the walleye which was the weekend special!  It was delicious and fresh.  The risotto was on point.  I actually told Joey that I wanted the chef to come out so I could give him a fist pound.  We all had a laugh, but in the end the experience was as we would get at a five star.    There was never a plate left empty for more than a few seconds before a wait staff came to pick it up.  Glasses were always full.  No complaints from us!    There was a bit of a surprise when the check came, but with a great experience comes a price.  If we didn't get drinks it would have been 30.00 cheaper."}
{"text":"We had my daughter's baptismal dinner in the beautiful back room of the Tuscan Inn. Jason was wonderful.  He went above and beyond in creating a spread to accommodate meat eaters,  a vegetarian,  and a vegan.  The staff was as incredible as the food."}
{"text":"I was visiting family from out of town.  The food was good not great and our waiter was amazing.  The menu had a ton of choices.  It is pretty much what you would expect when going to a Tuscan restaurant in the US.  My favorite was the risotto.  My husband had dessert.  He said it was tasty.  I was way too full to try any."}
{"text":"Very old, interesting place with great food."}
{"text":"I had a very relaxing date here the other night. I thought that the staff was very attentive and we didn't feel rushed at all even though we came in late on a Sunday night. I found them to be very accommodating when we asked to move tables.  The menu is fantastic, but I found the wine menu a bit overwhelming and pricey. I would have liked if they had more wines by the glass at more approachable prices.  Overall the food was excellent and very rich. It is expensive here but it was worth it for the romantic experience."}
{"text":"Ate here last week and definitely enjoyed it.  Started with the roasted garlic and flat bread.  Excellent, probably the best part of a very good meal, and a must if you like roasted garlic (the flat bread was great, too).  Also had the beet salad with goat cheese.  Not the best I've ever had, but also very good.    Finished with the seafood risotto.  A liitle bit rich for my tastes (which I suppose is the nature of risotto), but still very good.  It had lots of seafood, all of which was high quality, including the lobster.  My wife had the salmon and liked it as well.  We did not try desert.  Ambiance was nice, kind of rustic european.  If there was any downside, it was that service was just a little bit slow, but that was underatanble as they were very busy with a full restaurant (on a Tuesday night) and a big party in back.        Not the best Italian I've ever had, but most definitely worth return trips."}
{"text":"We went there for our anniversary and it was a nice place to go.  We are always looking for nice places we can enjoy and did enjoy this place.  The food was good and it was a little more upscale than say a bravo or olive garden.  We were in a small room at a small table for two and I didn't think it was that loud in the restaurant.  The building itself is not that big and the food was very good.  Personally, this is not a place I would take my kids, but I suppose you could take kids there.  It is a nice atmosphere and cozy.  It is a bit more expensive, but we thought it was worth it and a return trip."}
{"text":"A nice find in Allison Park.  I've lived here over 4 years and even though I knew it existed, I had never been motivated to try it.  We went here to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday and were seated in a private room in the back with glass walls and ceiling.  The view of the falling snow made for a beautiful backdrop but some dangerous roads later at night.  The table started with the antipasta platter and the flatbread with goat cheese, mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes.  The flatbread was a must have if you go there and to be honest, the best part of my meal.  It had such strong, great flavors.  The antipasta platter was good too.  For dinner, I ordered an item off the weekend special menu:  potato and Dijon crusted tilapia with a red pepper sauce and asparagus for $24.  The meal also came with soup or salad, and I opted for the spicy, black bean soup.  The soup was good but it was very thick so if you don't love black beans it was not something you should try.  The asparagus was grilled perfectly and tasted delicious.  The tilapia was ok and was the least favorite party of my meal.  It was cooked well but I couldn't taste any Dijon and despite my love of potatoes, there was something that I can't put my finger on that I didn't like about the crusting.  Maybe the crust was too thick and just wasn't crunchy enough but I'm really not sure what it was?  We had two servers for our table (group of about 15 people in our party) and they were great.  They kept the glasses refilled and were very attentive throughout the night.  My biggest gripe is that the place is a little on the pricey side.  With two glasses of wine at $10 each and the dinner at $24, it wasn't cheap.  There are definitely some Italian restaurants around town with better prices and equally good food."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem. My bone in rib eye was prepared perfectly accompanied by garlic mashed. Salad was freshly prepared and good size , the cobbler dessert will bring me Back. Great atmosphere with two separate seating areas. Nice uncrowded bar. Would go back."}
{"text":"Went for my mom's birthday. No one was thrilled with their meals or the wine. It was pricey as well."}
{"text":"Amazing service and really great food. From the attentive manager to the complimentary appetizer this dining experience was superb. Every item was top notch. Atmosphere is cozy and quaint. Great for date night or celebrating. My martini was best in Pittsburgh. Go NOW!"}
{"text":"Booked a last minute dinner via Open Table after researching the restaurant on Yelp.   As expected on a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was not busy, but that did not mean the food or service was lacking.  The staff was very polite, timely and attentive.  Even got a broader tour and history of the restaurant after our meal, as some seating parts are closed during the week.    Food was very good.  We had a lighter meal, focused on just soups and entrees, but both were well prepared and seasoned.    My dining partner had a roasted chicken dish that was moist and succulent, while I had a special which was also very good.  While they don't make desserts in house, the Tiramisu that I had was quite good.  There are a number of items on the menu I am anxious to try and given the excellence of our first experience, we will be back to try them out!"}
{"text":"The Tuscan Inn is our place to go on New Years Eve!  This is our 2nd NYE going there.  Our reservation was at 4pm, and it was the best time to go!  It was nice and quiet, not many people there yet.    We started with Jumbo Lump Crabmeat, which was so scrumptious!  Then Nick has his usual Caesar salad and I had the house salad!  You must try their \"House Salad Dressing\"!!  Then we both got the Surf and Turf NYE Special, which included a 4-6 oz of Filet Mignon, Crabcake and Asparagus.  Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious.  Then we did something different and actually got dessert.  What a wonderful decision......we got the Carrot Cake.  It is very good as well!  I definitely recommend this place for a nice relaxing dinner!  There are a lot of locals there, which makes it all the more cozy!  Thank you for a wonderful dinner on our NYE!"}
{"text":"YAY for delish gourmet food!  I had dinner here earlier today with the rents, and the food was on point.  I'm so glad we decided to try this place.  Thanks for suggesting this sweet joint, yelpers!  I knew I could trust you guys.  Anywho, we had two apps to start:  Focaccia di Pancetta ($11) and Cozze ($15). Both of these dishes were ridiculously yummy.  The flatbread was topped with smoked Gouda, pancetta, and fig, drizzled with balsamic reduction.  The cozze aka mussels were steamed in white wine butter, onions, shallots, garlic, and fresh herbs.  The flavors were all SUPER good, and portions were plentiful.   NEXT, a bomb soup course (or salad if you prefer).  I ordered the Cream of Carrot, but I tried my mom's Tomato Basil because I'm annoying and I have to try everything, HA!  Don't judge me =P Both soups were crazy tasty, but my Cream of Carrot was extra fab - probably the best soup I've had in a while!    For my entrée, I gotthe Capasanti - seared sea scallops with fresh roasted corn salsa, butternut squash puree, and cherry balsamic gastrique.  Definitely a scrumptious dish, but the scallops were slightly too salty IMO.  My parents definitely enjoyed their meals though (crabcakes & spicy calamari linguine).    All in all, we had a GREAT time here!  Tuscan Inn's a beautiful restaurant with amazing service and fantastic food!  Make sure to check this place out. You'll be hooked, for sure!  I know I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was as delicious as it was beautiful!  The staff especially Rebekkah  was congenial and very helpful!  Will definitely come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here in June with my parents who live 1.5 miles from here and haven't been in since 1999 or so.  My wife and I use Yelp all the time and with all the good reviews we figured why not give it a shot.  We were stunned at how delicious everything was!  The place is warm and cozy and the food was excellent!  The steamers could be the best I have ever had, and I've lived on the California coast for 16 years.  We met the manager Jason Lyrant and he made sure everything was superb and that we were enjoying everything.  Great service!  I think we were the last ones out of the restaurant, we were having such a good time.  It was our last evening in town and there wasn't a better way to end our trip.  You won't be disappointed.  My parents have gone back a few times now and love it.  Thank you Yelp, once again for showing us the way to good times and great food."}
{"text":"Yea, I'll give it 5 stars!   It's worth the 30 min drive out of Pittsburgh proper.   Chrisy was our engaging hostess for the evening.   The meal was 1st class.    Charcuterie plate with wild boar,  truffled pig,  beef,  prosciutto,  sopressato. .. yum.  Pesto gnocchi... perfectly cooked. ..  bit sauced up but tasty; crab cakes with zucchini spaghetti... really good flavor - I prefer less/no red peppers less mayo but yum!  Caesar dressing on salad authentic.  Chef has good palate with seasonings.   LaMarca prosecco went well with everything.   Rustic decor, could use some updating,  but still nice.   Intimate but not sitting on top of your neighbors.   Average to loud but it's a local crowd so a lot of people will say hello to their acquaintances.   We really enjoyed our meal.   Manager nicely stopped by to most tables which is always a good touch.  There is a bar & you can eat there.   Also a back room for private events/special events.      We'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch Awesome. It's brand new for the summer. It couldn't be better. The selections are fresh and vary from a Continental breakfast to ordering alacarte. Service was a little slow cause the server was more interested in talking about herself than serving breakfast. Overall a great experience. Any father would be excited to visit for father's day."}
{"text":"Their menu was being updated the night we were there, consequently several items were not available. The usually wonderful homemade bread sticks were served cold but otherwise our appetizers and salads were spot on. We ordered a very nice bottle of Italian white wine from their list to enjoy prior to the entrees. I ordered their goat cheese ravioli but substituted their meat sauce for the cream sauce. The combination was perfect. Others in our group had the lasagna or lamb chops. The lasagna was solid and chops cooked rare, just as ordered. Our server was competent, no more..no less. All in all, a very good meal  served in a relaxing environment. We plan to return to experiment with their new menu."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and it just keeps getting better...although I don't know how that's possible because it's fantastic to begin with.  We went two weeks ago for dinner.  The service is amazing!  Me and the hubby started with the flat bread with mozzarella and garlic.  We had a cup of their soup of the day, a bisque.  The hubby had the butternut squash ravioli and I had the Risotto Di Mare.  We finished with desserts.  The hubby had the Tiramisu and I had a caramel cake.  From beginning to end the evening was delightful.  And the food was delicious!  I just can't say enough good about this place!  It rocks!"}
{"text":"Finally the \"new\" owners are going old school Tuscan Inn. Quality, flavorful food, great wine, friendly staff and awesome desserts. The house salad and warm bread sticks great. Pasta bolegnese is my favorite. My husband had the free range chicken which I ate most of! Tasty risotto too. Had no room for dessert this time but the tiramisu is wonderful."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for Valentines Day.  We had never been there before.  I found it through my search on Yelp.  Let me tell you, we were not disappointed.  We each had meals that were Out Of This World!!  Not only were our meals extremely delicious, but the presentation was unique.  We will definitely be back! I highly recommend Tuscan Inn."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, and the food was good.  I had the duck which was a bit overcooked, as I ordered it medium rare.  It came out more medium well - but was still tender, juicy and not too greasy, as duck can often be.  She got the lobster ravioli which came with a large selection of dips, and she enjoyed that a lot.  It is a bit pricey, but it was a good experience.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Love it here!  Great food, good prices.  The only lyrics thing is don't go if you are in a hurry.  It takes awhile."}
