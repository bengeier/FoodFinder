{"text":"Jerk Chicken Rice Bowl - takeout I went over lunchtime.  My order took over 15 minutes to fill.  I'd give a lower rating, but the food is tremendous.  I'll definitely be back.  The place closes at 8PM."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place today, and am in love!  Menu consists of reasonably priced contemporary Japanese dishes like chicken/steak teriyaki rice bowls, pork/curry chicken and rice dishes, veggie rice bowls and a variety of salads.  I can recommend the steak teriyaki bowl and the sesame chicken salad.  We were served quickly and both dishes were excellent, light yet perfectly filling, for about fifteen bucks.  Will definitely be coming here regularly."}
{"text":"I've been to Saboten twice and it was very good.  It's basic fair, nothing special, but done very well. Basic noodle or rice-bowl type dishes, some sushi, etc.  The biggest draw is that it is locally owned and has very reasonable prices. My wife and I recently went there for a quick dinner and had two entres and an order of sushi for under $20."}
