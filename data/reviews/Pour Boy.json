{"text":"In the spirit of full disclosure, I was told about this place because a friend of a friend is one of the owners, it is new, and it was in my neck of the woods.

The place is a great new addition.  The actual space is very cool...awesome Hendrix mural on the entire front of the building, very open space for summer visits and it looks like it will be a very nice, cozy space for winter visits.

Nice selection of beers on tap.   Not a large selection, but it covers most angles well.  Not sure if it is an opening deal or the regular price, but pints are $4 taxes included!  That's pretty darn cheap for good beers (Mill Street, etc).

The menu is standard pub stuff with a few unique things like Pad Thai.  I had a burger which was excellent for a pub burger.  Not as good as my favourite (the Drake), but I wouldn't hesitate to order it again when I'm there and hungry.  The sweet potato fries that came with it were awesome (ie.  crispy, which is hard to come by in sweet potato fries).
There's never been much on that strip of Bloor.  If I'm going to Clintons to see a band, I am definitely going to make this a starting point."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am reviewing the new second location on College Street near Clinton.

It must be the Vietnamese ownership, but I have never seen such a menu at a place that presents as a sports bar! And I mean that in the best possible way. The Udon Noodles are a steal at eight bucks, and while I can't understand why it's the same price whether you get them with tofu or shrimp, I'm not complaining and I say gimme the shrimp please! Veggies are crisp tender and cooked to a turn. 

The most expensive item on the menu is the grilled salmon at nine bucks and while I am tempted to try it, I always end up getting the Udon Noodles. They're just. that. good."}
{"text":"Good pub type food at very reasonable prices.  The beers are very reasonable too, and I'll frequent on principle alone for that, as I hate getting gouged for a simple pint in this city.  Place has a good, laid back vibe."}
{"text":"Love this joint. Liberal prices, fast service and above-than-decent cooking. Come over with friends and you'll have a blast. If you come in alone, you have a chance of striking up a conversation with a poet or a writer. It can get louder on Friday and Saturday nights and why it shouldn't. One of my favourite pad thai's in town."}
{"text":"Fabulous spot- great vibe, excellent service and good beer and food selection. The Udon entree is incredible."}
{"text":"Good food, cheap drinks and nice vibe. Though I have 1 criticism, please don't assume that the change from the bill is the tip. You've lost my future business as a result."}
{"text":"There were 8 in our group.  I will give a run-down of our experience.

We were given pitchers of water and plastic cups.  We gave the waitress our order (she didn't smile or say much).
We waited for an age, the pitchers were empty and were never re-filled.  I asked why there was such a delay, 'they're making it' was the reply.  
Finally 2 meals arrived, everybody else waited.  
10 minutes later 2 more meals arrived.  One of them had a hair in it.
Another meal arrived 5 minutes later, by now the first 2 people who had been served were finished.
Another meal arrived.
The last 3 people waited and waited and waited.  A meal was left on the table by the runner, he never even asked who ordered it (nobody had ordered it, the waitress took the wrong order).  
The last 2 meals came and they were mixed up but the people took them anyway.  She said 'sorry I know it's pretty shitty'. The waitress then tried to give me the 'spare' meal and when I told her I didn't order it she said 'do you want this anyway?'  I said no and told her to cancel what I had ordered.  Then I left, went home, and cooked my own food.

This place might be a good pub, but it is not a good food place."}
{"text":"When my friends and I are looking for a casual place for some beers and food, we'll often come here if we're not in the mood for Korean.  The place is a casual and easy-going student-centric bar with a line up of domestic, import, and some craft beers.  Food is an interesting mix of things like sandwiches, salads, quesadillas, with pho, pad thai, udon ,etc.  I always go for the asian-y things since I feel the asian ladies in the kitchen do them better than the sad-looking quesadillas i've seen come out of there.  But their deep-fried tofu, and udon noodles stirfry are on my regular rotation.

The place is large, with a small patio out front, first floor seating (with the giant windows open, it almost feels like patio seating), and then an entire floor upstairs as well.  So even when I come with large groups, we almost never have to wait.

Only major inconvenience is they're cash only.  There is an ATM downstairs before the washrooms, but I don't know what kinda fees it charges, so consider yourself warned.

I also enjoy going to Java House, and they basically have the same owners and same concept, but I find the food a bit more flavourful, though a touch smaller at Pour Boy.

Think simple, hearty foods, bar rail, house red or white wines, pitchers and pints of sangria (!) and beers.  Service has always been decent.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Review is based on drinks only. 

So my friends and I came across this pub online while searching for cheap drinks, patio, toronto and so forth... typical tags for summer searches lol and pour boy came up! 

Our server was friendly but took a really long time to take our order seeing as it wasn't that busy when we got there.

We each ordered a 1.5L pitcher of white wine sangria for $17.50! This drink represents what summer is all about for me and their version was so refreshing, light and fruity! We also tried a pint of the red wine sangria for $6.25 which had a deeper flavour and was equally delicious. Both versions had sliced strawberries, citrus, mint, ginger ale, grenadine, orange-cranberry juice, wine and peach schnapps.

The food looked asian/thai inspired and seemed to be priced reasonably for the large portions I saw other tables receive.

Overall, we did enjoy our drinks and the cost did not affect the quality which was amazing! Loved the relaxed and casual vibe and definitely do see myself spending a lot more time here."}
{"text":"Had a quick pint of steamwhistle and a bite to eat at Pour Boy this afternoon. I had been for drinks before but never had anything off the menu. Nice patio and friendly service. Drinks and food are well priced. I had a simple brie and avocado sandwich with salad and my sister had the poor girl breakfast. Each was $6.25, simple and tasty. Nothing mind blowing but good value and exactly what we expected."}
{"text":"A great local watering hole with a really fun Monday trivia night.

Food and beer and is dirt cheap and OK quality; you basically get what you pay for. A really good place to come and have some cheap eats and drinks over candlelight. 

A nice front patio in the summer.

TIP: This place is cash only."}
{"text":"Came for some after work drinks on a Friday during summer hours. Cheap food and cheap beer. Perfect uncrowded patio. Top spot for a lazy beer. Ended up returning the following day it was so good."}
{"text":"SIXSIXSIX Manning.

This place is owned by the same people with Nirvana, Green Room, Java House, so if you're familiar with those spots- you won't be surprised here.

The benefit about this location is that it's the newest and less gross.

The mains are $6.95 and the pitchers of beer are about 12 bucks. The food is about 1.5x better than the price you pay for it. Pad Thai was a huge pile.

Cash only - sort of annoying when a table of ya's spend $200.

Non tax paying cheapskates."}
{"text":"Popped into Pour Boy on a busy Saturday night in Little Italy.

Drinks were very reasonably priced, under $10 for all pints. Craft beer selections were impressive. Had many offerings I've never heard of. 

The food was nothing special. Standard bar food. Fries, pita and hummus, nachos... It arrived fairly quick and hot so A+ for that. 

Service was quick and friendly. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a date once. We both went through our university years without ever going to a university pub, and therefore as working professionals we decided to make up for those lost opportunities and relish in student-priced drinks. The target market is definitely 18-24 year olds. There are wooden chairs and stained glass ceiling lamps. That should illustrate the environment for you very well. Basically, a very student-pub pub. Service was good, but I just felt kind of awkward to be served by a 50-year-old man that looked like my dad. I don't feel good about making an older-parent-aged person serve me. There is something not right about that. They should be retired and be the ones sitting down, being served! Ahhh. Anyway. Sangria wasn't bad, beer wasn't bad. Standard stuff, nothing special. By the way, check out their ugly but awesome website from the 90's. Gotta love 90's web design."}
{"text":"All RIGHT! This was one of those places I'd passed a hundred times and never thought twice about. The Jimi Hendrix mural was probably what turned me off - it just screamed popped collar frat boys who would drink all night and  then sing DMB songs with an acoustic guitar on their front stoop at the end of the evening. It reminded me on the Onion headline: \"Bob Marley Rises From Grave To Free Frat Boys From Bonds Of Oppression\". It just wasn't me.

Boy did I get turned around. There may well be a handful of douchtards there but generally it was an awesome vibe at the right price. Good tunes were playing and the assortment of vintage chairs and mismatched tables gave the place a unique feel. But it was the $4.50 steamwhistle that really caught my eye. I thought I had to slum for that kind of price - but here it was, a menu like the days of yore, long before the $8 pint of Canadian. My GF had a delicious Caesar served in an awesome PBR mason jar mug. I pounded pint after pint long past the terminal velocity that you hit when drinking on a work night. The place was quiet enough to talk freely but loud enough that you felt like you were in a good crowd.

Only critique is that the open windows and smoke friendly patio don't mix - indoors had a constant stream of the sweet smell of Belmont Milds floating through which is kind of a turn off if, you know, you don't like second hand smoke. But that was the only problem. The staff were super awesome and super friendly. All in all a great place to hang out and bang out a few beers. And if you want to meet up and play \"Crash (Into Me)\" on my stoop after last call, the more the merrier."}
{"text":"Affordable food and drinks. My partner and I popped by at around 11pm after watching a show closeby and were surprised that their kitchen was still opened. We ordered some late night comfort food (all day brunch!) and beer. They have a pretty long beer list. Bar food menu has the usuals and also some Asian flair, a good list of options. Very comfortable atmosphere, definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. First coconut beer I've ever tried was amazing. Nice vibe. Food is average though. Monday night charity trivia is really fun."}
{"text":"They had me with their great selection of reasonably priced craft beers. 

The knowledgeable server made the perfect suggestion for an IPA when I requested one. 

The food is also reasonably priced, and really good. I had a pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was fantastic. The fries were the best I have every had, hot and crisp with a dipping sauce that was mildly spiced and the perfect accompaniment. 

The menu offers an excellent choice of pub grub. The atmosphere is warm and friendly. The wait staff are fast, friendly and efficient. 

While it might seem sacrilegious to go to a beer pub in Little Italy, Pour Boy will be my destination of choice when I'm down there."}
{"text":"Pour boy was supposed to be a welcome reprieve from the stifling heat that has taken over Toronto, unfortunately it was not so cool. But what it lacked in a/c it made up for with a great atmosphere and smashing tunes. From the smells all around it would appear that the food was fantastic as well.

They had a healthy mix of \"close when you need 'em, and far when you don't\", which made having an exciting conversation all the more engaging. I ordered a Blanche De Chambly which they were out of along with their Pour Boy ale, they did however have my fall back Mill Street Organic. And for $4.50 a pint I didn't feel bad about ordering it in the middle of the day. 

Bottom line...I'm interested to drop in for another visit, but with so many soju spots right around the corner this little gem might get left behind."}
{"text":"Solid atmosphere inside that is much more intimate than pub like...not what I was expecting from the outside. Typical pub like food quality with some oriental spins. Drinks are solid but I was hoping that the selection would be larger. Food was average and the price was average...basically not something that is different. I had a burger and it was average...somehow I was hopping for more pub-like food on the menu. One annoyance is the fact that they don't take credit card so be ready with some cash. Overall, solid pub to chill and grab a drink since it is closeby, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Solid atmosphere, great prices. Food is average,  not very flexible with customizing orders and menu items. 

Great for grabbing pints with the crew somewhere hip, casual and ambient."}
{"text":"Overall, solid experience and I had a good time!  The service is super overally relaxed so come when you have time to kill and can just enjoy a nice pint or some quality sangria! Prices are super fair and reasonable. Food prices as well are awesome. There hops beer is lovely and has a nice kick and has a nice fresh after taste! It's a very open and chill atmosphere, I enjoyed my time on the patio here, it's a tiny patio tucked in on manning and I great to enjoy on a warm summers evening"}
{"text":"Great location, nice patio, good drink selection, slow service (but maybe just tonight?)"}
{"text":"If you want cheap beer and food along with a low key ambiance, this is the place. The vibe is great - low lighting and always a good crowd. The service is always very friendly and they have a rotating menu of craft beer so you don't have to settle for shit beer. The food is nothing special except for the fact that is all costs less than $10 (I believe). The nachos are super unhealthy and I love them for that reason. If you want a chill night out and are about saving those dollars, this is your spot."}
{"text":"We were waiting for our table at Snakes & Lattes when we decided to head down the street to Pour Boy. Some friends of ours allegedly visit here often, and rave about the cheap dive.

Very cool vibe. We went around 8 on a Friday, and it was fairly busy but not packed. It wasn't an issue to get a table. Its 2 levels, and we decided on a cozy table downstairs (lit by a cool little candle). 

Service was prompt. We ordered 2 double gin & tonics, and after we finished ordering, she immediately went to the bar and made the drinks. The entire process took what seemed to be 2 minutes. She was also very friendly.

We got the bill (after another round of drinks). Our 4 doubles brought the bill to a mere $28. Now that's affordable. Note that they accept cash only. 

Overall, very enjoyable visit, and we would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This is one of those great laid-back places to visit when you feel like bumming it. Are you a student and want to come in your Pajamas? Sure! No one is bound to care. The vibe is that laid-back.

Wondering what I mean? Well, whatever comes to your mind when I mention the Red Room, Nirvana, and the Green Room? Well, yeah, that.

They are almost carbon copies of each other, down to prices and a good chunk of their menus.   

Personally, I never order any food at places like these, since their mix-&-match Thai-Fusion dishes tend to fare fairly negatively when compared to the quality of the food that can easily be found at a stone's throw from the bar. I mean, Korean Town and the Ossington stretch have some pretty good restaurants, thus why would you do yourself the disservice of not eating at one of those restaurants instead?

What this dive is great at, is showing up with friends, catching up a game in the winter or chilling on their patio with a cold one during the Summer. Which is really the main reasons why I drop by, and to be honest, they should be yours too.

Do not expect more much than cheap drinks, and a fairly sized second floor for larger groups. 
Also, as a positive, once nighttime comes, the candles on the tables do add a badly needed sense of coolness and ambiance to an otherwise drab looking interior. I am not kidding, even their floors are fugly. 

So, the lesson here is this, if you do come here during the day, make sure the patio is open, if not, then wait until it gets dark. 

I would say the biggest gain is for the locals who have a dive-bar with a pseudo-international vibe to compete with the more Canadiana-looking Clinton's a block over. 
 
Definitely not worth the drive if you live far away. Great if you need a drink and happen to be in the hood and want/need to stay in it."}
{"text":"Parked ourselves here on a bright Wednesday afternoon, and were not disappointed. Great service, excellent beer, fantastic selection of hard to find brews. We loved the decor, and the prices were great. Was a nice cross between a pub and a bar, and I can see the place getting better with age, especially the bar, which was covered in tile. A large space too, and can easily see groups sitting down easily. The only disappointment was the food; bland pub grub, which seemed out of place compared to the beer selection. Its a new place, and it shows, but I look forward to returning when they truly develop their groove."}
{"text":"Not impressed. My friend made a HUGE reservation for her birthday this past October, we were 20-25 people. We sat a long table upstairs, and drank plenty, and spent a lot on food and drink.

As the night wore on, we started to stand up and mingle, and some chose to settle at some of the other tables that were available. You know how it is - you're crammed together at a big long table, hard to get in and out to the bathroom or to get another drink, it gets loud, people want to stretch their legs. 3 or 4 people would get up and go it at another table to have a quieter conversation, leaving some empty chairs behind.

Apparently, despite the fact that no one wanted those additional tables, and there were no people waiting anywhere to sit down, this was unacceptable, and we were repeatedly admonished to not spread out and \"take up so much space.\"

There was no table service, and nobody waiting. We were not being greedy with the table real estate, and their insistance that we all squeeze into a tiny corner was not put forth in a particularly friendly way, shall we say?

This is not how you run a late-night spot."}
{"text":"pour boy has a decent patio in the middle of Korea town. it's a rather random location for a casual bAr, but the patio is quite amazing during the summer. I quite enjoyed the sangria in the summer but the food is just mediocre, nothing spectacular or memorizing. overall a good place for a random drink in the area, but probably not special enough for a pre-planned event."}
{"text":"Incredible prices for drinks and food! Tons of vegan options and vegetarian options. The menu has some Asian inspired meals as well as your standard burgers and fries pub food. Service is awesome, drinks and meals come in a flash, and the servers are really friendly. Lots of seating space, the decor and music is chill. I highly recommend this place for hanging out with groups or on dates. I ordered the fresh rolls, garden salad, and my boyfriend ordered chicken fried rice. Everything was great! Will be back. 
Note: cash only!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in this area. The prices of food and drinks are crazy affordable in contrast to the fancy restaurants close by, yet your still getting the candlelit dinner, the pretty decor, and the super friendly service! There are vegan options too! I ordered the garden salad and tea, and fresh rolls which were both yummy. My boyfriend ordered a burger and fries which he enjoyed. I highly recommend this place for dates and for groups. There are also televisions here showing games, but you won't hear the commentary."}
{"text":"This pub is pretty great when it comes to affordably-priced food and drink and decent atmosphere. It's a bit dark in here but that's par for the course for a good pub. I rather liked my meal. We had good service and a good experience on the whole."}
{"text":"Pour Boy is located on Manning near the north west corner of Bloor and Manning in Koreatown.

This is a nice place with mostly indoor seating and a few tables outside as well.  The menu is made up with a mix of standard pub favorites and a side of Asian things.  For instance besides our drinks we also ordered poutine and shrimp chips.  The shrimp chips didn't seem freshly fried (hot and oily) and the poutine while decent didn't really have much cheese it seemed.  

Originally we sat indoors as the patio was full in the corner where the bench was like a church pew but eventually we were able to move outside because a table opened up.  The service seemed friendly and the drinks were brought out pretty fast but the food wasn't overly impressive for what we had ordered."}
{"text":"Was downtown with some friends last night and found Clinton's was closed because the LCBO suspended them for overcapacity.  In search for another hangout spot we stumbled upon Pour Boy. It was packed! 

Two stories, and we managed to grab a table meant for 2 for the 3 of us. The beer list is pretty decent. $4.50 a pint. Teas and coffees were decently priced (I was the DD so no drinking for me... Good thing too because certainly enough as I approached the Gardiner Expressway Ramp en route back home R.I.D.E. was in full effect). 

Their cappuccino was pretty dang good. I expected a watered down, tasteless cappuccino but was pleasantly surprised! Their green tea was a bit weak.

The service here was terrible, maybe because they just weren't prepared to have an onslaught of Clinton's-converts show up and flood their bar. The music and vibe was good. Old school jazz and soul music... Long lived James Brown! 

Another friend ended up joining and we wanted to move to a bigger table behind us where the folks were wrapping up only to be told by the hostess that the table is taken. We then had to go downstairs and find ourselves a table, but not before we were told \"you gotta pay up your tab first.\" I then asked if she couldn't just bring the bill downstairs and she said \"no we can't!\". They are so badly coordinated. We placed an order for a decaf, and then changed our minds and ordered another pint, but sure enough she brought both. After she took our order another waitress asked us what we wanted and we told her we'd already ordered and she said \"just tell me again because she may have forgotten.\" When my cappuccino came they brought it to the table behind us and then wandered around wondering who ordered it. What a zoo!

The only food item we ordered was the fried tofu. Fried tofu? Really? Fried tofu at a pub? That was a first!  It was served with a sweet-chili dip. It was pretty tasty but way too oily."}
{"text":"I came here last night for some stand up comedy, not really knowing what to expect. It really drew a good crowd for a Tuesday night! I had a Muskoka IPA from their rotating tap but they also have a great local and international representation of craft beer. The food menu is extensive and there's enough variety for everyone. I'll definitely hit this place up again."}
{"text":"From the outside you think this would be a \"live music\" , rock or blues type of bar.  The 2 story building is painted with a kick ass mural of Hendrix and Dylan.

I went with a friend and we sat on the patio.  I was slightly disappointed when our waitress informed us that it wasn't really a music bar. although they might have an act perform once in a while. That was the last of any disappointment...

This place had a friendly waitress, great prices on alcohol, and an interesting \"bar food\" menu. I'm hungry for some Grilled Cheese and Sweet Potato fries!

I will update and give more information on this review once I try the menu."}
{"text":"The pad Thai!!!! 
Shrimp, chicken, beef... Doesn't matter. 
Eat it!!
After you order the pad Thai... Grab a pint and sit out on the patio. 
Really great vibe, super friendly staff (slightly odd but in a fun way) and good mix of crowd. 
Only downside but I guess this applies to any patio on the street, no real privacy and people walking by are very... Very close to you. They look on jealously while you stuff your face with the shrimp pad Thai, extra spicy!!
Recommend and will be back again!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. They are always fast, friendly, cheap and tasty. They've split bills for parties of 8 for us. Great patio + upstairs has big windows that open, a plus in the summer!

Definitely a fave."}
{"text":"Wandering around the city on a food/drink crawl, we decided to stop here as they have an patio.  It's a bit small, but a decent size for a group of people.

The inside is a bit dated, but the service was friendly. We initially were seated indoors as no space on the patio, but one soon opened up and we asked to move outdoors - no problems at all!

The server recommend some drinks for us which is always nice.  The table ordered some small foods - shrimp chips, poutine - so I had a little of each and wasn't particularly impressed.  It tasted like it had been sitting around for a few hours and just re-heated (the poutine).  The shrimp chips din't have that nice crisp crunch to them.

The drinks weren't bad - just come here for a drink or two, people watch on the patio and enjoy your time here (minus the food)"}
{"text":"Went for some Saturday afternoon Sangria. Location is right off Bloor and pretty easy to find. The establishment is pretty small, but there were a few people there enjoying some food and drinks when we went. Service was pretty good too and they have a nice outdoor seating area.

The sangria was mediocre. Tasted pretty watered down from the beginning and it just got worse as we approached the bottom of the pitcher/the ice started melting. On the cheaper side of what you'd typically expect to get in Toronto though."}
{"text":"We came to Pour Boy while we were waiting for a call from Pinky's Ca Phe down the street. 

I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this place! The beer was good, the food is very reasonably priced and came out super quickly. We got two of their rotating tap beers-- honestly I don't remember what they were called. Our server recommended the one that tasted like pineapple and the one that tasted like dark chocolate and she was totally right, they were both great! We also ordered fresh rolls with shrimp ($5) and Penne with shrimp and rose sauce ($9) both were super fresh and tasted really good! 

Our server was really nice too! This place is cash only and casual dress. I would definitely come back for a casual hang out and drinks with friends. The atmosphere and staff are both super chill and really relaxed."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend who use to live in Ottawa and they had a Pour Boy pub there too. It was definitely out of the way of where we all lived so there must've been something good about this place.

I took a quick look online and my eyes lit up at the prices on the menu... looked like drinks and food were priced like it's 2005!

A couple blocks from Christie subway station, this place had a nice patio out front and a small sitting area inside. For a group of 8, we decided to chill outside.... and DRINK! For $15.75 we had a huge pitcher of Blanche Chambly which filled 3 glasses to about 20 oz each. That was a pretty sweet deal.... speak of sweet, the glasses of sangria seemed just that - full of juice and a gradation of fruity sips, but everyone seemed to be enjoying them.

We also ordered a few plates of nachos... which were unfortunately plain sad. They were presented on circular-type baking sheets. There were barely any chips, and the cheese was hardly visible. Barely any toppings accompanied by salsa and sour cream, but at the end of the day, I don't think I can really complain at the $8.75 price point.

At the end of the day, come for a drink (or many drinks), sit on the patio and have a great night chatting with your awesome friends."}
{"text":"Non-descript bar. Cheap. No craft beer list. on tap. The menu is basic. But they played The Smiths, Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen and other alternative acts while I visited!"}
{"text":"Great chill out place but smaller tables. Better get a reserved for Friday nights. Menu is limited but good quality. Music is slightly louder than typical dining place (great for students/young at heart people). Fast servers n relaxed environment."}
{"text":"Average food. Decent prices. Very attentive staff. Good in a pinch when you need a place to meet up for a bite."}
{"text":"If service is what matters, I had a pretty rude waitress. 

For my friend's birthday, she had reserved a table for around 4-6 people at Pour Boy's. While they were kind enough to let my friend bring a cake in for the birthday girl, our waitress totally sucked. 

Our the entire party was a little slow to show up, so at one point in the evening the waitress asked us if we could move to a different table to accommodate for the larger party that had just arrived. First, there were three of us seated at a four person table; Second, we had made a reservation unlike the other party; Third, the waitress was pretty insistent about moving us to a different table and had the balls to ask us a number of times how sure we were that they were coming. 

Was not happy with the way they treated us."}

The good:
- cheap drinks (13.25 pitchers too)
- relaxed
- sue tran is a great server and fun
- nice and cheap food menu
- upstairs, downstairs and patio
- relatively clean bathrooms
- welcome addition to the area

The bad:

- extra pitchers surprisingly show up on your bill"}
{"text":"Imagine you've accidentally brought your date to a poor restaurant in the area or you suddenly realized that they hate Korean and you're now looking for a place to drown that embarrassment with some booze. This is how I was introduced to Pour Boy. 

It's a small and dark wooden place that at first glance seems like it would be rather dank but ends up being cozy and relaxing. 

The service was pretty friendly and the drink prices were very reasonable. Now I haven't had any food here yet, but I genuinely recommend this place for a quick drink or a chance to relax and forget about your troubles. The low lit atmosphere actually makes it quite an enjoyable getaway when it's raining or snowing heavily outside."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite pub in the Annex/Toronto.They have a great setup, a great food selection and the best staff. I'm veggie and there is no shortage of options. The staff are always helpful and chatty (special mention for Brittney and Dearbhal). Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off with very rude service. 
All beer pitchers are listed as $15 on the menu, but when our bill came our pitcher showed up as $17. When we mentioned to our server that we would like the difference back since the price was falsely advertised on the menu, she said \"I'll just take it out of my tip\" and gave us the $2 back. I tried to explain to her that we did not mean to take it out of her tip, but rather the bill itself.

Later as I was standing by the bar waiting for my friends, I overheard her complaining to her coworker about the amount of tip we left her and she was mocking what I had said about \"false advertisement\" (We left a 15% tip). She continued gossiping about us for at least 5 minutes until my friends returned. She did this while aware that I was standing about 1 meter away, hearing everything she was saying about us. 

I confronted her later, politely explaining that its very unprofessional to be complaining about a customer while the customer is standing right there. She denied it saying she wasn't compaining and did not apologize. It left a very bad taste in our mouths, and we will be contacting management regarding this incident. 

Aside from that, the $10 \"muchos nachos\" was the smallest I have ever seen in a restaurant, with 1 layer of chips sprinkled on a tray. 

Not at all fond of the skimpy portions and the entitled attitude our server had."}
{"text":"SUPER RUDE WAITRESS! Hope the girl either changes her behaviour or they throw her out!"}
{"text":"K-Town really needed a new bar, the hipsters at Clintons were overflowing into the streets every night.

I have been so excited about the opening of Pour Boy over the past month. I didn't even know what exactly it planned to be, but I saw the spray painted wall mural completed last month and I was hoping it would be something cool.

Pour Boy finally opened it's doors a few days ago. Last night Eric L and I stopped in to investigate.

It's a two-story bar and restaurant wedged on the corner of Bloor and Manning st. We sat outside on the patio (nice tables and big wicker chairs) but popped inside and upstairs to check out the rest of the place. Full bar on both floors, nice decor, dark, candles, vintage looking chandeliers. Definitely classier than the decor at the Green Room, more of an intimate vibe.

Our waitress (VERY friendly!) explained that Pour Boy is operated by the same owners as the Green Room (Annex), Red Room (on Spadina) and Nirvana (on College).

The drinks are cheap and they have a cheap and expansive food menu too. A pint was $4, bar shots $3.50 and my giant pint of diet coke was $1.50

I will definitely be back to try the cheap food. They had a selection of bar food - burgers, sandwiches, pad thai, perogies, fajitas, salads, brunch items. Grilled cheese with sweet potato fries is only $4.50!!?!? Hook me up.

Will update my review after a few more visits."}
{"text":"Monday Night Trivia Nights at Pour Boy!

So my college buddy (who just finished up his MBA at UT) & I attended our first TN up here in T.O on Monday 6/20.

Mon 8pm - Pour Boy, 666 Manning Ave (& Bloor St), just west of Bathurst St in Korea Town, Metro: Christie/Bathurst, Wi-Fi, cash-only, $10/team (max 6 players) with the money going to charity, the Horizons Children's Centre (http://www.facebook.com/Horizons.Childrens.Centre).

Trivia takes place on the 2nd floor of Pour Boy, a nice gastropub with a healthy menu that's not typical of must restobars.  I really like how they serve Creemore on tap.  Trivia didn't start right away at 8pm as most people were still eating dinner before participating.

There were 5 other groups besides my friend & myself.  Most groups had 5 of 6 people, so we knew we'd have our asses handed to us w/o teaming up with others.  Luckily, the Quiz Master asked her sister's group if we could join them, and the 3 of them obliged.

We teamed up with the woman who ended up founding this Trivia Night), the QM's sister, & her fiance.  It was a perfect pairing b/c each of us knew genres of knowledge.

The format was 4 regular rounds with 10 Questions each.  Round 1 Q's were 5pts each, and each subsequent round's Q's increased to 10pts, 15pts, & then 20pts.  There was also a Name That Tune round (essentially Rd 5, 10 Q's, 10pts ea), and a Final Question (same wager rules as Final Jeopardy).

We couldn't come up with a good team name, so I just pulled up a name from the past, \"Quiz in a Box\" (I was trying to think of \"Quiz in My Pants, but couldn't remember the name).

After Round 3 (see the attached scoreboard pic), we were perfect.  50pts in Rd 1, 100pts in Rd 2, & 150pts in Rd 3.  For Rd 4, we missed 1 Q, and had 9/10 correct for 180pts (out of 200pts).
The Q we got wrong was:
\"What type of veins are provide blood between the heart and the head?\"
Louise guessed Jugular, but I thought the QM wanted something more generic, so we settled on arteries.  Turns out it was \"Jugular Veins\".

The Name That Tune round was a lot easier than what I'm used to down at NYC trivia nights.  No super obscure songs.  We only needed to name the song title.  Some songs were Kiss (by Prince), Under Pressure (by Queen & David Bowie), some Rush song (they're Canadian), I forget the rest.

Going into the Final Question, we had a 560 vs 545 lead against the 2nd place team \"The Trebecs\", so we wagered 531pts, so that if both teams answered the Final Q correctly, we'd win by 1pt.  Likewise if everyone answered incorrectly, and if every other team wagered the full amount and dropped to 0pts, we'd end up with 29pts.  We were able to set our wager after finding out the category, \"Physical Geography\", which we were confident in.

Final Q:
\"The Sahara is the hottest desert in the world.  What is the coldest desert?\"
Answer: Antarctica.
3 of the teams got it right.  2 got it wrong.  2nd place got it right, but fortunately we did too.  We won 1,091pts vs 972pts.  The QM told us that our score was the highest ever score set at Pour Boy!  The highest possible score is 1,200pts.

We learned some interesting facts.  All of these questions we got right, but using logical guessing.

Q: In 1887, a German physiologist invented what optical device?
A: Contact Lenses

Q: What Italian dessert means \"pick me up\"?
A: Tiramisu (lucky guess)

Q: What pasta means little tongues?
A: Linguini (sounds like \"lengua\", which is tongue in Spanish, and -ini means small in Italian)

Q: What is the largest muscle in the human body?
A: The glutius maximus (the butt)

Q: Terry Fox's (a deceased Canadian running legend) mother recently died.  What was her name?
A: Betty

Q: The Leaning Tower of Pisa is made of what stone?
A: Marble (we figured it needed to be something heavy, to cause the tower to lean, so ruled out limestone)

Q: What is the scientific word for sense of smell?
A: Olfaction

Q: For golf's Davis Cup, which two geographical regions compete against each other?
A: Europe vs. USA

Q: Who did the Blue Jays beat in the 1992 World Series?
A: The Atlanta Braves

Q: What is the second book in the bible (Old Testament)?
A: Exodus

We were lucky they didn't ask many Canada-specific Q's!

For placing 1st at Pour Boy, we won Steam Whistle collector's sets that came with a tall can of Steam Whistle beer and a pint glass.  Steam Whistle is a brewery located in downtown Toronto.

I really liked this Trivia Night and will return.  It's great that they donate the fee to the children's center, a boys orphanage in Ghana.  The TN organizers are active volunteers and finance and built the orphanage and are currently trying to build a larger building to house the boys.

Two sets of QM's (both are couples) rotate as the QM each week."}
{"text":"Pour Boy is a cheap bar and my local joint, tucked into Manning just above Bloor. It has a patio, it has a terrible comedy night, it has fresh rolls, pad thai, sandwiches etc. until midnight, it has $6 pints of sangria, it has plenty of wood and stained glass and *ambiance*, the servers are crispy, the floors are flooral, you can go with a big group or with your boyfriend or with a book and it always Feels Right, they have martinis in martini glasses if you want to do and be that person, and there is a laundromat next door in case of emergencies.

Other patrons are sometimes awful, and it's not like everybody knows your name, but everybody knows their own name, which I think is good enough."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and really well priced. My boyfriend and I came here for Super Bowl Sunday. I had the chicken burger with sweet potato fries and he had Singapore noodles. The quality of both were great. We've definitely found our new local"}
{"text":"Overall this place is pretty average, so here's some highlights:

The good:

- Avocado & Brie sandwich.  Quite tasty! Not as good as Red Room's but definitely up there.
- Sangria. They offer red and white.

The Neutral

- Sangria. It's OK Sangria. It's not traditional in anyway as they just mix up the ingredients behind the bar when you order it.  It's not pre-made and the fruit hasn't been soaking.  It's still refreshing on a hot summer day
- The patio. It's a decent size for the area and you can fit a good sized group onto it if needed
- The staff. They were pleasant and on the ball.  Nothing over the top though.

The not so good:

- The staff. They were very attentive at first, but once they started to get busy we had to flag them down to get any service.
- The music. The selection was fine but it was very loud.  The volume was probably fine if you're out on the patio, but if you're inside, you can barely hear the person next to you."}
{"text":"Cheap food is a plus. I was a little annoyed that they couldn't split up our bill for 5 ppl and they added a 15% gratuity.


Fuck... That.
Not good for groups."}
{"text":"The Pour Boy Pub is located at 666 Manning avenue which makes it an excellent locale for my neo-satanic meetups. When walking west on Bloor, you can't miss the mural of Bob Dylan and Jimmy Hendrix on the second floor looking down at the citizens of Koreatown. It's two floors of pubby goodness and has a spacious patio out front too. 

Came on a Thursday night and it was pretty lively in here. We grabbed a seat on the second level, which is less claustrophobic and (slightly) brighter. The menu features pretty decent draught selection and a lot of late night eats. We went for the cheapest pitcher ('cause that's how we do) at $13.25. Not bad. Since we were snackish we grabbed an order of the deep fried tofu which was maybe the worst thing I've ever eaten out of a deep fryer. Super oily and tasteless.

Service was exemplary. Our server won us over quickly with a Larry David impression and kept us imbibed during our visit. An excellent place for a nightcap or midnight snack.

Obligatory Title Pun: Come here POUR BOY, boy can you get it up?

Menu Readability: Using a Comic Sans clone. Not sure if this is better or worse than actually using Comic Sans.

Need to mention: Free Wi-Fi! We all checked in like fiends.

What this place teaches me about myself: I know better than to order deep fried tofu at a pub."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to chill and get a cider. Always suggest it to friends who are wondering where to go after a day in Christie Pits, or shopping in the annex. Kat is one of the best servers in this damn city, and there's usually a table available, even on Fridays."}
{"text":"After the better part of an early afternoon spent trying to find somewhere to day drink Pour Boy presented itself as a beacon of drinking salvation- finally, somewhere half-decent we could drink before 4 in Toronto!

It also helps that the service was quick, friendly and attentive; the pub has an artsy, warm and cozy atmosphere; the snack food was great; and everything was cheap. Definitely the kind of establishment I could hang out in for a while."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for some brews and cheap grub.  Patio gets packed in the summer and as a former smoker, can get REALLY SMOKEY."}
