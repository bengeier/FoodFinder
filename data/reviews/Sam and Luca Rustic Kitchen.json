{"text":"We stopped in for dinner for my sons birthday. He said his spaghetti was the best he had ever had. Loved the food, decor and good beer selection on tap. All food was tasty, quick to come to the table, and everyone was super nice. Will definitely be back. Happy to support the non chain restaurant in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Started out good, but called the other day to book the private room and asked for the manager or owner.  The person that answered said \"what can I help you with\" so I said \"are you the manager or owner\" and they replied \"don't worry about it, what do you want!\"  I hung up and will I longer be  patronizing this establishment.  Very rude and uncalled for!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this restaurant.  Good location, nice exterior and interior.  Our server, Shannon did an excellent job.  Opened the door for us, seated us immediately, brought water and bread and took our drink order.  But things went downhill from there.  We ordered the chicken Marsala to split.  The fettuccine tasted like it had canned sauce over it.  The chicken was so tough we could have used a steak knife to cut it.  All and all, everything was pretty tasteless!  We would have given it one star except for the service of course we were the only people in the restaurant.  There are so many other Italian restaurants in the area, I would go elsewhere."}
