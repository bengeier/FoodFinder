{"text":"J'aime la place et la bouffe.. Le prix est raisonnablement et le service est rapide et courtois."}
{"text":"The service is terrible, maybe it was only that one person but I felt so disrespected. The food is pretty good but not so much to make me come back."}
{"text":"I like cremino. Their patisserie is real good, staff are nice and what i like most is the decor...it's posh a d always very clean, feels like a lobby in a 4star plus hotel heh"}
{"text":"Love this Lebanese patisserie...their cakes, sandwiches and salads are amazing... Never disappoints. Place is clean and spacious. Staff is always friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. While it looks like a fancy bakery and coffee shop, it really has more to offer than meets the eye. I had lunch here once, and we bought a cake another time. The cake was wonderful, but the lunch was so good - who knew their lunch menu could knock it out of the park like it did!  I had a simple chicken fajita sandwich. It was cooked to perfection, with tender chicken, sautéed mushrooms and onions, just the right amount of cheese, and the softest, most amazing bread I have ever had. It came with a tasty side salad and an excellent cup of soup, also. I had the red lentil soup, and it was hands down the best lentil soup I've ever had. I tried an almond cookie for dessert, and I couldn't believe how soft and tasty it was. I will eat here again and again whenever I am in Montreal. No need to even try to top this place!"}
{"text":"Very good quality coffee and pastries.  The place is nicely decorated and always clean."}
{"text":"2em meilleur Resto café près du marché . Il offre une variété de pâtisserie, sandwich et salade et crème glacé. Une option très convenable dans le coin.  Mon coup de cur, des pâtisseries miniatures qu'ils appèlent \"petit four\". Plus particulièrement celui  chocolat et amande.... MIAM!!!  Pourquoi 3/5: Même si l'endroit est bien tenue et confortable. Même si  il y a un choix intéressant et de qualité ; c'est froid comme atmosphère. Il n'est pas facile d'inspirer autre chose quand on est dans un environnement commercial comme le Marché Central. Les fenêtres donnent sur la rue Acadie.  Quel est mon premier choix des les environs du marché.... j'ajoute l'endroit et je vous en reparle :))"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is so iffy. Understaffed and made us feel like ordering was such a hassle. Could barely ask for anything without getting attitude or feel guilty asking. The attitude was what bothered us."}
{"text":"Ice cream is good...but the cake and dessert is not that good...need to approve it...service was good!"}
{"text":"Had heard some good reviews about Cremino from friends so we finally gave it a go. The interior is very modern, bright and clean. It looks small from the outside but it is actually very large and inviting inside with a lot of seating spaces.   There is too much to choose from - from pastries and creamy cakes to a variety of biscuits and gelato. As we were just passing by, we customized a box of biscuits which is charged by weight. We chose our favourites and more, which the staff kindly packed for us and were happy to take home a lovely pink & white Cremino box of goodies.  The biscuits were similar to many Lebanese bakeries around Montreal, but they were still super tasty. I have yet to try the cakes and sandwiches etc so will probably be back.   Overall, great place if you are in the area but not worth travelling to :)"}
{"text":"A place where critics are not welcome. An awful customer service with complete arrogance and lack of respect to the customer. Old pastry is sold in this place. A complete turn off. A place to avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Very good and wide selection of cakes of all kind. They also do customize cake for special occasions. They have also a dine-in menu , not huge but most  of the items are delicious especially the steak sandwich. They do the best croissant in town. The service is ok , not great however not bad. I think thats whats lacking in that place. All said i definitely recommend it ."}
{"text":"Service is terrible, and they sell you old pastries. When I informed the cashier that I wanted to get another pastry or a refund because it tasted awful and stale, he said he couldn't help me and the other worker in the back started laughing. Never returning to this place."}
{"text":"Best cake I've had in my life. I ordered a photocake in the event of a friend's birthday (see photos below).  There were 4 choices of cakes I could order for a photocake: Black Forest, White Forest, Cortina, and Fraisier.   Anyway, so what's a photocake? It's a cake where you send a photo in any format and they print it on a layer of sugar (100% edible). Great for bringing up those funny/embarrassing old memories back to life.  I picked the Cortina which is a chocolate sponge cake with double chocolate cream (custard and chantilly) because that sounded like the most awesome chocolate cake in the world.  And it was: perfectly executed and guests loved it despite eating it right after a sushi buffet. The cake was firm, yet well aerated and didn't taste greasy at all. The homemade cream didn't feel as oily as creams on cakes I'm used to getting.   I also sampled a piece of their 'White Forest' cake, since I'm only familiar with the 'Black Forest'. It was truly outstanding: a layer of real fruits between two layers of vanilla cake. And the cake stood firmly (didn't fall apart).  Overall high quality pastries. They sell ice cream in the hotter months, so I'll visit again for that and to sample more pastries."}
{"text":"Je recommande cette place si vous voulez un endroit chaud ou placoter avec sucreries tranquilement avec des amis. Bcp de tables, bien aeré, grand choix de gateaux et tout. Café exellent selon mon ami et thé disponible."}
