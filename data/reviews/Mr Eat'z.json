{"text":"OK, let me start out by prefacing the fact that I've ordered from here several times along with my co-workers (upon their recommendations) and the food was generally pretty good. I've had their italian sausage sandwich (decent), the philly cheese sandwich (pretty good), pastrami (pretty good) and their chef salad. The chef salad is quite decent but they put these onions on it that look like they were meant to be battered and deep fried for onion rings. They were so large and overpowering that I started requesting to leave them off of the salad. Overall, the food has been decent, but this last time, I decided to get a small order of chili cheese fries. My God, that was a mistake. The chili was obviously out of a can...easily mistaken for dog food (even the smell took me for a loop). The cheese was like cheez-wiz....not appetizing at all. And like many reviewers stated, the fries were soggy. The fries are ALWAYS soggy. They don't punch a hole in the containers to let the steam out so once they're delivered, they are too far gone.   As for the delivery time, that's absolutely crazy too. For being in a fairly close proximity to their establishment, they sure take a LONG time, even if it's just an order of salads for myself and my co-workers. The delivery guy is different every single time and they are often a bit rude.   My co-worker ordered the chef salad yesterday, but was told they increased the price by almost $2.00. We unanimously agreed that we'll find some place new to get lunch.   The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because I can't lie and say they don't have good food, they do. But when you wait well over an hour for your food, you hope it at least tastes good, and when something as easy as chili cheese fries is as egregiously bad as it was yesterday, it's hard to want to eat there again."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! The burgers are the best!!! Bout to get one now :)  Always fresh and have it ready when they said it will be. LOVE MR. EATZ B) My kids love it, and my oldest daughter goes there after school to get her some pizza. Definitely going to order the party pack for my daughter 5th birthday!!! Keep it up you guys."}
{"text":"No longer accepting yelp deal. Refused my coupon 4/16/2017. Yelp refunded my money but still has the deal posted."}
{"text":"Good food for delivery food. I order here pretty often now that I know about this hidden gem. The lady who answer is super nice. They have a variety and everything that I had was pretty good. Delivery might take a hour but well worth it"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was awesome. We did delivery, and it didnt take so long; i mean comparing to other delivery places..... The food was great hot and good no complaints .... I truely recommend this place for a stay home watch movies day...."}
{"text":"Recommend the double Philly cheese with American cheese. This sub is affordable and full of flavor. I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Best bacon cheeseburger I've had in a long time.  I was surprised just how good it was.  Better than a lot of the \"high-end\" burgers!  Delivery is timely and the food is hot and fresh!  This is my go-to place for a burger for now on."}
{"text":"My wife and I chose Mr. Eatz out of a coupon book. While the atmosphere was kind of cool (it is a small, walk-in joint truly meant for take-out orders) the food was...well...blah.   My wife had the Meatball sub. The sauce was bland, the meatballs nothing special and the bread was, well, bread.  I ordered the Fish and Chips... Standard fish, a bit on the breaddy side. But no chips... coleslaw instead. After looking at the menu again, it specifically says fries come with the meal.   Overall I was disappointed and wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! Bad service, horrible food. Ordered delivery. Took over an hr to arrive. I live 5 miles away.. The Pastrami sandwich I ordered barely had any meat on it. They forgot the toppings I asked for and the sandwich was really soggy. The hamburger we ordered came with about 5 pieces off French fries. They also forgot the drinks that came w our meals."}
{"text":"Have you ever had that ill feeling that you just threw good money down the drain? Well same here... $28 wasted. My husband and I got a Patty Melt, Ravioli and Garlic Knots. Patty melt was wafer thin - for a visual, it was the size of a McDonalds hamburger - skinny and small. Why did we bother ordering it well done? 60 seconds sitting on the counter at room temp would have made it well done. Ravioli was dry and short on marinara and they completely forgot the marinara for the garlic knots. Maybe they were running low tonight??  Nothing more irritating than wasting your money on bad food."}
{"text":"Pastrami Burger is to die for....Love the food at Mr Eatz..."}
{"text":"This place was awesome the food was excellent. Ribs amazingly perfect fall-off-the-bone meet great tank Finger Licking Good that's all I can say. Their buckets surprise me because I was thinking it would be in the Box with their fingers and wings but they came in this huge pizza box filled with chicken fingers and fries I mean there was enough food to feed an army. The customer service was awesome the lady and the men there were just aim to please I would recommend this place highly if you come out how to Vegas"}
{"text":"I just ordered online delivery and even though it took close to two hours to get my food, the taste supersedes that.  I got the hoagie steak and a chicken salad sandwich and they're both equally delicious. The steak sandwich is soft like butter, and the chicken sandwich full of fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion. Both sandwiches are really great in size and the prices you can't beat it. Definitely will be ordering again within the next week! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This was the WORST pizza I have EVER had! Nothing close to the picture, it had 8 little chunks of chicken (BBQ Chicken) it took an Hour and it was STONE COLD! Next time I will buy a FROZEN pizza I am sure it would taste better than this so called pizza did! There was Next to NO cheese and it supposed to have extra cheese what a crap pizza!! I posted it on my FB what it looks like compared to their pictures.  Told All my friends to avoid this place! Wasted $24.00 on a pizza to gross to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Great prices decent food their Philly cheese is a hit, that's about the only thing I can vouch on."}
{"text":"I ordered a Patty melt that came cremated with not a hint of seasoning would have only given them two stars but mom's canzone and Greek salad she said were good, not great but good."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much- in fact, even armed with the Yelp app directions, I drove past it. The exterior just says PIZZA & RIBS, instead of the actual business name. That said, now that I've found it, I'm not going to forget.   There's currently a Yelp deal up, $10 for $20 credit. They also have $5 discount codes for ordering online. Either of these can be combined with their super-low lunch special prices. And even the lunch portions are enormous! So far, I've yet to find anything that isn't tasty.  RIB TIPS: The favorite dish so far, an entire takeout box packed full of meaty pieces, and better than many of the crappy barbecue spots here in town. $10 PHILLY SANDO: Lunch special is a hefty sandwich packed with meat and grilled veggies, plus a side of fresh fries, for about $8. This easily makes two lunches for me. WINGS & FRIES: Their sauce choices are few but the wings themselves are large and meaty, and even the meal comes with ~12 pieces. Not sure how many come in the bucket or half bucket, but this is a generous portion. Bonus points for offering a Cajun flavor that is actually a sauce instead of a dry rub!  Service is friendly and fast. Location is a small and messy takeout counter with no seating available. Majority of their business is delivery."}
{"text":"Delivery was quick and within the time they promised, pizza was good - even my husband who normally doesn't eat pizza loved it & wings were the best we've had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings, fingers, Pizzas, and Yummy phillys with delivery! Easy online ordering with fast delivery. My new go to on busy days."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ordered Mr Eatz for the first time today and it was surprisingly good! As well as quick! The delivery person was very pleasant. I will definitely order from there again."}
{"text":"Had Mr. Eat'z catered for our office Christmas party and the food was amazing! Highly recommend the Ribs.. Slammed it out of the park with the Ribs and Baked Ziti. Going to order and pick up on my way home from work in the future. Pepperoni Rolls are also highly recommended! Try it out for an easy take out dinner for the family..."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING my roommate and I order from here is amazing. We've tried over 20 menu items, and every time, we both agree, it's as good as it gets. Flavors are great. Texture is great.   Wings are great. Ribs are great. Garlic bread is great. Salads are great. Cheesesteaks are great. Pasta is great. Pastrami is great. Chili Cheese fries are great. Everything is amazing.  They also accommodate all of my requests in every order, quite well.  Mr. Eatz is my Las Vegas goto restaurant when I need to eat."}
{"text":"We have been ordering Mr Eatz at LEAST once a week for over a year now! We have NEVER had a bad meal or experience!  The chocolate cake is EXTRAORDINARY!!"}
{"text":"i should have taken the other reviews more seriously but i was feeling lazy and hungry...I just wanted it delivered -u know?   it only took about 45 mins   but the meatball sub was just so disappointing..so bland and just not enough sauce. the meatballs were so dry and bad,  -they were crumbling right before my eyes.  i imagined that they had been frozen for years and then thawed and served to me. -im so grossed out by that visual  the delivery driver was nice but there was an additional $2 tacked on to my order on top of the delivery fee and taxes -so his tip would have been about $2 more if that didn't happen."}
{"text":"I have ordered from you a few times before but this was the absolute worst experience ive ever had with any delivery service. I called at 8:20p 7/23/14 i ordered 2 BACON double cheeseburgers. First the lady taking my order was snippy and had an attitude then she states my order will be $20 and will arrive in 40min to an hour and i said ok. i did not receive my food until 9:45p and the gentleman reeked of weed covered in tattoos and asked for me to give him my license number i said no since this was never asked before and he just stood there like it didn't process then eventually said ok and left. So i open my food after the gentleman left and my order was wrong and cold. These burgers were black and tasted like they sat all day! I am never ordering from you guys again! I am blown away on how you can screw up an order that easy!!!  Sent from my iPhone"}
{"text":"Got a Burger from here, it tasted like hospital food. Wish I could of gotten my money back, but it's okay just wont be back. The service was mediocre at best, food was ewww."}
{"text":"Love them! We order them at the office all the time! Their delivery is fairly speedy and their food yummy .... especially the sausage sub and philly cheesesteak!! Even their caeser salad is delicious. Plus good portions. Def recommended"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from this place since 2006. They have tons of awesome specials to choose from. We have tried a variety of items pizza, wings, fingers, ribs and a few sandwiches.  Everything has been good. Delivery does take a while but the food is always fresh and hot when it arrives."}
{"text":"I used to order here all the time with my mom & sister & it was great. 2 years later not so much. I had a big order, my girlfriend & I were having a movie day, & they messed everything up. I called & the lady was rude as hell, told me my delivery time was 45 minutes. An hour and a half go by so I called back to ask where the food was & it didn't sound like she was paying attention. I told her my address & she said \"ok\" & after a few seconds of silence I said uhh yeah can you tell me where it is & she said \"ok\" after a few times repeating this conversation I started getting upset then she finally told me that it'd be 20 more minutes because they were \"10 minutes behind\" so the guy finally gets here after another 45 minutes & the fries were soggy, sandwich bread was burnt, soggy, & cold. Sandwich meat was full of fat so I couldn't even eat it. Mozzarella sticks were all fried & stuck together, & the garlic knots were dry & had a burnt taste to them. Last time I'm ordering from here."}
{"text":"This place is delish you have to try there pepperoni pizza it's the simplest dish but they have this garlic sause that you will LOVE."}
{"text":"The best spot for wings and pizza, it's a hole in the wall and if you're going to fast you'll miss it but the people that work there are awesome and funny humble people! You gotta check this place out if your in the summerlin area, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Have been looking for a good Mom and Pop restaurant to get a good burger and chili cheese fries. This is not it. First time ordering here and their burger was very bland, the amount of fries served with it seems like they belong in a kid's meal and their chili cheese fries, besides being $8, were packed up WITHOUT the chili and cheese. Had to go back to get my order correct. Although the workers were nice, and food is made to order, doesn't seem consistent per other reviews that have been left. Not sure if I will be coming here again, I may give them another try, sometimes bad days happen, we shall see or I may just continue my search for that amazing burger place."}
{"text":"Nope. OMG, as my sweetie said.  Absolutely horrible. The chili cheese fries were not edible. The fries were super greasy,  the chili was some mess out of a can, and there were beans in the chili. The cheese was like that ersatz \"cheese \" that comes out of the machine at 7/11. mixed with jalapenos. I ate about two bites.  The \"charbroiled burgers \" hardly even OK. With so many good burgers in Vegas, including even the fastfood burgers -- there is no reason to buy at Mr Eatz.  I could smell the grease through the styrofoam and plastic bag. 1 frigging star, and that is generous. Never again."}
{"text":"This food is delicious.  We found a flyer on our door and we live waaaayyy in Summerlin, but they delivered.  I had a house full of kids for the weekend and decided to give it a go!  The burgers that we ordered for the \"big\" people looked exactly the way a restaurant burger looks or one that you would make on your own.  It was juicy and delcious and hot for a delivery!  The chicken finger flavors vary and they were great as well.  And big shout out to you for using Open Pit BBQ Sauce (fellow-Chicagoans would understand).  For a delivery restaurant the food was perfect quality and got there when they said it would.  The pizza was devoured by the kids and you absolutely cannot beat the prices.  Oh yes, and the salad is huge enough for several to feed on!  No skimping of the meats and veges!  This is now our favorite quickie, go-to (delivery) place when we're too lazy to step out but have hungry mouths to feed."}
{"text":"Door flier food......oh my! I typically hate and almost always never try the \"door flier\" food menus that end up at my house ,but MR. EATZ  is the exception! It's like bar food done exceptionally well, and it's the go-to spot for my husband and I when I don't want to cook and he can't make a decision. Here's why I like it and what we order: ~White pizza.....if you love cheese order this biznatch, WTF?!?!?! ~Meatball sub....not too saucy, doughy yet crusty bread and prefect meatballs. ~Garlic knots.....no explanation needed! ~Chicken finger and waffle fries! ~Wings! ~COUPONS galore.......great combos! ~Fast delivery and GREAT PRICES! =)"}
{"text":"Almost 2 hours for delivery. Driver couldn't get in gate but never used directory to look up my name? I called and they apologized and gave me a credit for a future order (which was nice). But eating dinner after 10 pm = not fun."}
{"text":"Yummm! Just got a ham and cheese sub with fries and it was so good! Bread is toasted on the cut side which I love! Fries were hot and delicious. Will definitely order again"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Yelp and was worried due to the previous complaints but within 40 mins there was a knock at the door. Chicken Philly is really good! I'll definitely be ordering delivery again"}
{"text":"Trying to use the Yelp coupon I purchased was a STRUGGLE. The woman on the phone, who seriously lacked professionalism, seemed stressed out and had no clue how to ring it in... but I don't want her to ruin my review... the food at this place is INCREDIBLE.   There is normally a hispanic woman working and I feel terrible I don't her name... but she is amazing.  She is so nice and helpful and even offered me an additional coupon when I came in... I love love love the pasta special... 2 pasta entrees, 2 salads, garlic bread, and 2 sodas.... the entree portions are enough to feed 2 people. . . this place is only 1/4 mile away from my house and i feel like a fool for never trying their food...because they've been putting flyers on my door for years... Try this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Love their Cajun Wings!!! They are our go-to favorite spot! We order from Grubhub and it's fast and our meals are always HOT when we get it!"}
{"text":"This place is great, have never had a bad meal and they give you a lot! Fast delivery, courteous on the phone. Would recommend you try this place!!"}
{"text":"I guess you either love this place or hate it. It's close, and has delivery, so the food is still hot when it gets here. That means I'll put up with a lot. I can also drive there quick and save the delivery fee & tip. They recently trimmed my wife's favorites and some of mine from the menu. No more Alfredo sauce or fish entries, along with some other stuff we used to get. Still get stuff from then when I'm on my own and don't want to leave the house. Never tried their pizza; I rely on the big boys for pizza & wings."}
{"text":"I picked up my lunch, and when I tell you it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, no lies are told.  Hot and fresh. Yummers"}
{"text":"When I ordered my meal, I didn't think Mr. Eats would be good, but they definitely proved me wrong. I really love the fries, wished they have given me more. Lol   It was pretty good and everything tasted fresh. I would so recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have ordered 2 more times since my last review ...and this place is consistent. Delivery is fast, the burgers are good. I haven't made another attempt at the BBQ but, I haven't been disappointed since. They have definitely become my go-to place for quick delivery food."}
{"text":"Just had food delivered from this place and found 2 big pieces of plastic wrap in 2 slices of pizza. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"We ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich and the BLT. both the sandwiches were okay. The BBQ sandwich bread was soggy because of all the veggies on it. I feel like my bread on my BLT was either too toasted or stale because it was hard. I was REALLY unimpressed with the potato salad. For one, when I asked the girl if it had raw onions, she told me it was store bought. So they don't even make their own potato salad. Not only that but they hardly gave you any! A very small scoop! Which I'm not really complaining about now since it tasted disgusting like it was made with miracle whip. Over all I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"The food is really good here! I got the 14\" pizza with the wings and fries. The pizza was good. I loved the dough! Now the wings were the best! I had them Cajun style and it was BOMB!!! They were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The Cajun flavor was perfect. A little on the non-spicy side but overall delicious! This place is very close to home so I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Come check out the pizza, wings and ribs!!!! Absolutely delicious! Great staff, fast delivery drivers and again..... the food is great!"}
{"text":"On a good day, the fries are perfect, the burgers are delicious and I'm stuffed. We haven't had any good days in  a while.  This place can make some delicious food, but lately it has been terrible. The fries were way over cooked, the club sandwich only had turkey, and the bread changes EVERY SINGLE TIME we order it.   I love my lazy days and being able to just order a yummy hot meal from my laptop, but this place is so incredibly inconsistent lately, I won't be ordering again.  Positves: Delivery drivers are nice. Customer service is decent. They just need to figure out how to make the same dish the same way  every time.   It's time to find a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places to get an amazing Philly cheese steak sandwhich and fries! And don't forget their ranch, if you're anything like me, I'm a Ranch lover and this ranch is like crack! Ah-mazing! I don't think i've ever had anything disappointing at this place... you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! The chicken wings are Fireee !!! My order was delivered on time and also super nice customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place, the grilled pastrami on rye is to die for.  When you order it, please get the bread toasted, and the pastrami grilled, with raw onions. Pickles, lettuce, and mayo. The pizzas are fabulous. Try their ribs, the best in town."}
{"text":"We ordered spaghetti and meatballs for delivery , the food was nasty very runny and meatballs were way overcooked. Will not be eating from here again not to mention delivery was about 1 hr!"}
{"text":"Pizza has always been delicious when we order. The pepperoni rolls are yummy too. We enjoy ordering from a smaller place versus the big chains all the time.  Only recommendation is pickup is much faster than delivery."}
{"text":"Love the wings for here and a good pepperoni pie. They always make it with just the right amount of cheese and love how the always offer you parm cheese and hot peppers. And if you check in you get a free soft drink"}
{"text":"I was at the Pub next store and we decided to get some greasy pizza and wings..   we were successful with our decision.  The pizza was greasy and the wings were good.    The place is decent prices due to low overhead and in a very small unit.   They should demolition the crappy gas station next store that closed down 2 yrs ago and expand so they'd be a more legit restaurant and off a lot more food with seating."}
{"text":"Food made it here in 20mins.. I usually wait about 30-45mims durning lunch time. I ordered chicken finger lunch special.. was hot and fresh. We love mr eatz"}
{"text":"Fast delivery always . Great food. Delivery guys are friendly. Have ordered from them several times!"}
{"text":"I would say that Mr. Eatz is a great place to grab food for movie night or watching a sporting event. They've got really big chicken fingers and great prices on their lunch specials. I have been ordering from them for years. Not sure if the ownership is the same as then, but I still enjoy the deals. This place also has large party pack kinda deals so I'm sure it'd be great if you had to quickly feed a family for an affordable price. They're most own for the pizza and fried stuff, but their salads aren't bad either. The pizza isn't my favorite, but it's still pretty good. I prefer their buffalo style chicken fingers. Don't expect to sit down if you go to the location. It's sorta like a Dominos, standing room only for takeout items."}
{"text":"We have frequent office staff luncheons, and we continue to order from Mr. Eatz a few times a month. The food is always fresh and hot and tasty! On Mondays, they often offer a $5 pasta special: any pasta entree, including premium ones like Eggplant Parmigiana or Lasagna, are only $5 on Pasta Mondays! The portions are HUGE. You can't beat this for taste, or value!"}
{"text":"Really tasty food for cheap, amazingly friendly service too. I like to support the mom & pop shops over the big box ones whenever possible and Mr. Eat'z definitely has won me over. The hot wings are on point and the cheese pizza (didn't wanna spend extra for pep) was on the level of Papa John's - the crust is awesome. Just check them out already."}
{"text":"The pizza has really spicy sauce and two much of it. It tastes like you could have made it at home with Kraft singles.... But what do you expect for 1.50 slice. I only had the pepperoni but it was really gross. I ordered two slices and only ate one."}
{"text":"delivery was fast! we tried the half finger and half wing special w/ fries and ranch. The fries were okay and the wings were tiny. both were ordered medium flavor and it was tasty enough to satisfy my junk food cravings.  get the yelp special! $10 for $20"}
