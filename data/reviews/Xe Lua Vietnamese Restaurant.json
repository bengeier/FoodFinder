{"text":"This is THE go-to resto for me when I need to grab a quick take-out dinner while my place is being re-done.  Will get lunch here too.  My bias will likely show.  Their \"raw pork\" vermicelli dish (I usually get it with the beef) is second to none.  Haven't found a better joint with better raw pork.  Same with their steamed egg rice dishes (usually get with chicken).  Avacado shake is good, hard to perfect for everybody (some like it thicker, sweeter, colder, etc).  Same with their Curry dishes (the thicker the sauce goes better with the softer part of the bread, but thinner sauce is better for the crust).  The pho isn't the best in the city, and they default to the thick rice noodles if you don't ask for the dry thin version.  So took a star off for that.  I'll still order a medium when I'm in the pho mood, I just make sure to ask for the dry stuff.  There are likely other dishes that aren't the best in the city too.  But the last time I was at a five-star unicorn restaurant, where every menu item was a home run, the staff were super busy trying to bat down the flying pigs they had in the kitchen.  Service is fine, but maybe because I'm a regular, so I'll shut my mouth.  Still, they're packed during lunch and dinner times; but have never rushed me out or brought the bill prematurely.  All in all, you're sufficiently stuffed for a very reasonable price.  Decor, staff, and other (wifi) are fine.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Literally sat down, ordered and received our foods within minutes!!!  Atmosphere was bright clean place with many tables. Sat at the booth and was very comfortable. Had the vermicelli but the pork was kinda bland. The spring roll was crispy and the vegetables were fresh. Portions were really big! The noodle soup was tastier!! The broth was full of colors and full of flavors. Will visit again when we're in the area."}
{"text":"It s not 100% orginal Pho I m Vietnamese so the way they make Pho and other Vietnamese food is much more similar Chinese..and overall..i see the owner is Chinese"}
{"text":"The Pho Bo Kho was 60% fat and gristle, and the little meat that was there was tough and chewy. The BBQ pork was clearly pan-fried in oil. The Pho broth was just hot MSG water.  Here's a good rule of thumb: if you walk into a \"Vietnamese\" restaurant, and all the wait staff are speaking Chinese, don't eat there."}
{"text":"I don't understand the harsh reviews on this place... Went here for the first time 2 weeks ago and there werent many people there, hence service was pretty decent for me. I only came to order pho. The broth was flavourful, the meat was nice just how i like it (cut thinly and small). I don't normally get rare beef, however the tripe was pretty standard too. The only thing I disliked was their noodles...it was too wide and filling for my taste (hence the 4/5 star). Besides the thickness of the noodles...I would say everything else was decent. The waitress was kind enough to let us know that I ordered one of the milkshakes that it wouldnt be fresh fruit being used, but powder instead. I was grateful for that and changed my drink order."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, the Pho is one of the worse I've ever had in a long while, and the Bun rice noodle with grilled chicken was flavourless.  Much rather drive a bit to Pho Metro my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town."}
{"text":"So being very critical with my pho experiences, I've decided to finally write  review for Xe Lua Vietnamese Restaurant. They are a small restaurant chain with around 3 locations in Toronto. One in Vaughan, Chinatown and now North York. The north york location replaced the awful Top Saigon but in my opinion made no difference in the quality of the pho.   The atmosphere is clean, modern and comfortable. The service is quick but not too friendly as most of them are run by mainlanders with rude attitude. What comes with quick service is poor food quality. The portions are fair but should be more careful with how they cook the food. You'll find that their noodle soups, or pho in the case, are fatty and greasy. You can tell that they take the rice noodles right out of the packaging, place it in a ladle, cook it in a water boiler and dump it directly into the bowl. They don't bother hanging the ladle for a few mins to drain the water and oil. (Seen with my own eyes). So what you're left with is fatty pho and a bit of regret after eating it. As an experienced chef, this is not acceptable and makes me sick to my stomach... literally.   The great thing about Xe Lua and the reason why I gave 2 out of 5 is they tend to open pretty late to accommodate the bar and club goers. So if you're out late and need something to relieve your alcoholism then this is best place to go. Just be cautious of the s.w.a.t. team... get it? if not then watch this - https://youtu.be/1XoT6VQE0q8"}
{"text":"If I could give a 0, I would. Ordered shrimp summer rolls...awful. Two rolls 6 half pieces of shrimp for $5. It was stuffed with thick rice noodles and one leaf of lettuce. The satay grilled chicken was not grilled and the sauce they gave was so little that it only filled 1/4 of the bowl. Also ordered the vermicelli with grilled pork and nem rong. Grilled pork had no flavor or char marks that one would expect with GRILLED meat. Nem rong was ridiculously hard and dry, not to mention tiny. Fried spring roll was just pure grease.   Definitely would not go back."}
{"text":"Overall it's a pretty standard Vietnamese restaurant, the decor is nicer than most. We ordered the #108 rare beef and beef ball pho a small one and an extra large (S/L/XL). The XL is pretty huge and there was a lot of noodle. They serve the thick rice noodle and not the thin type. Spring Rolls #601 it was pretty good. I also ordered at tri-colour ice, which is red bean, mung beans and Agar Agar jelly in coconut milk, I haven't had this since I was really little and this was really disappointing.   Pro: Nice Decor, free WiFi (password: 88228822), good service, waiter speaks English  Cons: Thick rice noodles (really depends on your preference but I prefer thin, made a mistake on the bill and charged us more, no fish sauce on the side to add to pho."}
{"text":"My grandparents and I thought, what could be nearby and offer decent lunch fare on a sunny week day, not be packed with people, not too expensive, not too slow of service...and I thought hey! What about Xe Lua? Pho is a quick dish to bring up, and you can't possibly get it wrong, right?  Unfortunately, this bowl of pho had me asking what the pho as soon as it arrived. Instead of pho noodles (or even pad thai noodles) I was served with Chinese flat rice noodles. You know, ?? (\"ho fun\")! To top it off these were the lifeless, overcooked kind, which is really a textureless mushy mess. The beef and tripe were mediocre, my rare beef was dry and tough (it might as well have been well done because it tasted like it despite its colour) and the broth did nothing for me. Sad all around. My Viet style coffee took over to filter through, by which time the water wasn't hot enough and the condensed milk at the bottom left me with an odd room-temperature concoction that I didn't care for. Sadness all around.   I noticed the lunch crowd was weak, mostly people with the same mentality - quick meal, no wait, cheap and close by. Service is as expected (minimal, as needed). From a you-get-what-you-pay-for perspective, I guess it's fair. I mean, I didn't get food poisoning, the place was actually pretty clean and well ventilated, and the servers weren't rude or anything. But unless I have to, I won't be back, sorry!"}
{"text":"Crowded, noisy and hot! Something was wrong with the heat today. Service not so great. Under staffed. Kept getting the orders wrong, the bills wrong. Restaurant is super crowded, there's barely enough space to walk through.   I don't really like the pho here because they use the thicker wider noodles. I personally like the thinner noodles. Today I also ordered a mango salad, comes with fresh mangos, onion and peppers. More mangos than anything else. It was pretty good except 6 dollars seems a bit steep. Seems like just a place to grab a quick bite. Quality of food okay but service not so great."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in terms of aesthetics, with nice large tables, but when I ordered a pho it wasn't that interesting. They offer a lot of meat and noodles, but the broth lacked flavor. Perhaps they got too many complaints about MSG or something and they toned it down.  Wouldn't really come here for the pho."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. The Pho at time can have smaller portions of noodles while if you order any noodle soup dishes, they can be plentiful..a good, affordable place to eat with friends and for a quick place to eat as well."}
{"text":"Normally, our experience here is good. However I must detail a bad experience I had, which is written below.  The food 's quality was poor and the service was aweful. I ordered a bowl of rare beef and tendon pho. I was first presented with half a plate of raw bean sprouts and before I could ask for the bean sprouts be partially cooked (which is a common practice), the waitress made no eye contact and quickly turned away. When the noodle arrived,  I was shocked to find all the beef in my bowl was fully cooked. When asked if it was a mistake and what happened to the rare beef, I was told that it was the right item and in fact I should have indicated earlier that i didn't want the beef be cooked because everyone should know that their soup is always hot. I realized she was not interested in addressing my complaint.... so I asked her why would i want cooked beef when my order was rare beef.  The waitress again ignored my complaint and went on and on, literally yelling at me.  The waitress later came back and unwillingly put down a plate of sliced rare beef , saying that that was from her boss and  quickly turned away. It initially looked like an act of service recovery but it was not. They just did it to shut us up as it was delivered in a haste and  with no apology  I didn't want to add  the beef in the soup as it was completely raw and the soup had been sitting there for some time already  My husband in good faith decided to follow the suggestion and put the beef into at that point warm soup. Sadly the entire bowl of soup noodle was tainted with blood. It was totally disgusting and unsafe to eat. A very disappointing experience!!!"}
{"text":"Not authentic pho. The broth is bland and tastes super diluted, the noodles used are Chinese hor fun and it just lacks the flavors of authentic pho. I live like 5 min away from this place but I would much rather go further to get decent pho."}
{"text":"Every Xe Lua location in the GTA has been very consistent in the quality of food and service.  The Pho is very delicious in the hearty Pho broth, the amount of noodles and the amount of meat you receive in each bowl of pho you order.   The other menu items (Vermicelli, Rice, Curry) are other key items you should consider ordering if you are looking for a change of scenery from pho once in a while.   Overall, the service of this location is very decent and the waiters are very attentive if you have a request that needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"I'm a pho lover. I love the noodle soup pho. My experience here the last couple of times I came have been horrible though. The service is bad and are rude. I went one time with my fiance and he always gets a rice dish - his food came out cold. We told them about the temperature and they kept talking back saying it was not. All you really need to do is go and heat it in the kitchen and bring it back. Worst. I've never gone back since."}
{"text":"Always go here when i want pho. But their mi-phun noodles are the fat kinds. My friends do not like the thick rice noodles but prefers the thinner noodles. The wifi is okay. They have electrical outlets to charge the cell phones so it is convenient, when your battery is low. The mango shake is quite good so we always order that. They have 2 tv screens so you can watch chinese tv and cp pulse 24. The waitstaff is nice and all knows me. You can sit there as long as you want. There is no pressure from the staff to try to kick you out. They are very friendly. Chinese owned Vietnamese restaurant. :)"}
{"text":"THE MSG THEY USE AT THIS PLACE IS SO RIDICULOUSLY HIGH that I was already constantly drinking cups of water when Im not even finished eating yet. They used thick noodles for the pho here so its not the most authentic place for vietnamese food either. And on top of that the quality of beef they served with it is like dollar store meat . Will not be returning here no matter how much im starving"}
{"text":"It's a pretty standard Vietnamese restaurant. Love the fresh rice noodle they serve! It really stands out because most Vietnamese restaurants only serve the dry rice noodle. The dry rice noodle itself is really easy to break and no flavour at all. The fresh rice noodle has more flavour itself and more tender. Plus since its fresh it allows to absorb the soup easily which will give an extra layer of the flavour to the noodle.   I am so addict to it. The soup is not oil and the beef is always tender and does not have a lot of fat.  I come to eat here really often especially when I feel exhausted after work."}
{"text":"Pros: Fairly extensive menu. Lots of options. Free WiFi - ask for the password. At the moment, it's 88228822. It works quite well. Score!  Chili oil - Sriracha is standard. Chili oil is a plus. Vermicelli with spring rolls, Vietnamese sausage (possibly called raw meat on the menu...) and grilled chicken looked delicious. Heard the spring roll was fairly authentic, with taro bits in it.  Presentation for the curry goat with rice was not bad.  Cons: Rare beef pho (small size - $6.50) - I've never had a small pho this small before. There were two individual soup bowls worth of noodles in the small pho. The beef was cooked by the time they gave it to me, thus defeating the point of having rare beef. It doesn't count as rare unless it's rare when served to me. It's like serving cooked salmon as sashimi... Not only was it cooked, but it was tough to eat. Leathery. Not cool.  Curry goat - sauce was very watery. When my mom informed the waitress, the waitress said it was because they use the same curry sauce for the curry noodle broth as well, and that the consistency of the sauce is fine because it's good if you want to dip bread in the watery sauce because the bread will soak it all up. Ridiculous excuse. If you have broth-like soup and you dunk bread in it, the bread will most certainly soak up the broth, but it will also go extremely soggy even if it doesn't break apart on you. This was actually the second excuse the waitress made for this curry dish, the first being that they don't serve roti because Chinese people don't like roti. They prefer bread, and so Xe Lua only serves rice, noodles, or French bread. Um...okay then. Hi! I'm a Chinese person who likes roti. I know many Chinese people who like roti. I don't mind if you tell me you don't have it on your menu, but don't tell me it's because I have supposedly strange tastes for an Asian person.  Limes - I have a friend who introduced me to a very interesting way of eating pho. Take a whole bunch of lime wedges (I asked for extras), and squeeze them all into your broth. Then, take the sweet sauce and squeeze a generous amount into your broth. What you end up with is a slightly tangy, but not overwhelmingly sour broth. It's oddly refreshing, but still savory. The unfortunate thing about the limes here are that they're turning brown. Yeah.  I will probably be back (how unfortunate) because this place is fairly close to my house, but I don't think I'll be getting the pho or the curry again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is amazing I loved the service and really enjoyed the food. The environment in the restaurant is just breath taking. The waiters in the restaurant are very kind and they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Vietnamese pho!! Huge portion sizes, great value, fast service. Also has rice dishes, vermicelli dishes, Asian appetizers, sweet drinks.  I've said most of these things in my review of the downtown Spadina location of Pho Xe Lua: http://www.yelp.com/biz/xe-lua-restaurant-toronto-3?hrid=b9B3zGn0Kk34iQCw6KiR5A"}
{"text":"Called in and made an order for Pho takeaway in English. When I arrived, the employees thought I couldn't understand Chinese and started making rude comments. Pho was okay."}
{"text":"As most Yelpers have already said, this is your typical Chinese run Pho restaurant. They do use fresh noodles - I think (they are wider and much more slippery). Nothing special, a bit below average because of the skewers, see below.  The chicken satay skewers were a huge let down. The   chicken was not marinated whatsoever. The satay sauce is a Chinese style satay, not like a peanut style satay I've had at other Pho joints."}
{"text":"saw the brand new sign for Xe Lua so close to home and was overjoyed. There really is a dearth of good Pho Places within 10 min drive from my place, so this would be a welcome addition to the few other restaurants in this plaza.  ( The Spadina location is my usual, after party dinner place and they do serve up some yummy Pho at that location )  The restaurant must've just opened (7th Nov 2014 )and the decor is modern, great functional layout, and the furniture was ergonomic. The menu had the regular viet staples ( pho, bun, com, banh mi etc. ) a lot of items marked off as Not Available Yet.  My guest had ordered Rare Beef Tendon + tripe Pho and I got a bit adventurous this time with an order of Bo Kho( Spicy Beef stew ), The tea was on the house and served fast by the 4 wait staff. The two bowls came soon after. Not sure if the wait staff were being paid less or if they were over worked but they came across as being very cold and after serving the bowls, chose to stay near the bar and chat up rather than check on any of the guests at the tables. ( was 8pm )  The Pho was mediocre at best, the noodles were a tad under cooked and the bean sprouts served on the side were certain past their prime and were wilted and browning in spots.  The Bo Kho was a total let down tho, the spicy looking stew was lacking salt and worst of all, the beef was hard and fibrous. It was so under cooked that after trying two morsels my jaw was aching from the chewing. Through the 20 minutes of our dining time, not once did the wait staff bother to check on our table.   After finally getting the attention of a young gentleman ( must've been the owner's son ), i explained that the beef was undercooked and hence i wasn't able to eat it. They wouldn't discount the cost of the dish from the check and I was in no mind to reason with them.  Wish this was not such a let down"}
{"text":"Super fast service, got our pho within 5min just because we wanted to grab a quick lunch.  The three color dessert was pretty good, there was kidney beans, mung beans, black-eyed peas, tapioca, jelly, fruit, and coconut cream.  Sweetness went well with the pho, I liked it."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty standard. We ordered a bunch of combination dishes for take out. I like that they give lots of vermicelli & veggies. Their spring rolls were okay. The meats in their dishes weren't seasoned much so if you like food without too much sauce this is the place for you. I thought that their fish sauce tasted bland. Not sure if it was watered down or just not the most flavourful brand. Anyway, the service here was fast & they were polite & efficient. The manager was friendly, smiling & thanked us for our order. We would order here again for sure."}
{"text":"What I ordered: Seafood Pho ($8), Bun ($8), Wonton and Noodle soup ($8)  Pros: - Prices are cheap and the noodles are very filling, good place for a standard lunch.  - There is plenty of parking and space available in the restaurant.  - The food arrives quite quickly if you're in a rush.   Cons: - The Pho is pretty average and there aren't that many toppings, just a few shrimp or crap cakes. It is the noodles that makes you full.  - Vermicelli was bland but it was good you could have more sauce and sriracha on the side."}
