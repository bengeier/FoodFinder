{"text":"Went for lunch mid-week, and loved it!! There was a young man and a young woman working at the time, and they were both super friendly and the service was quick! It was a little busy when I went, but I only waited about 10 minutes from the time I ordered to the time the woman brought out my food, and she even apologized for the wait. They had a decent amount of seating for the size of the place, but a lot of people were ordering food to go. They also had free wifi, of which I'm always a fan.

I had the Lord Cheesus and I never thought I would say this, but I think it might have been too cheesy for me! It was delicious, but thank goodness I also got a small soup to go with it so that the creamy tomato soup balanced out the insane amounts of cheese. I'm not sure if I would order that again unless I'm in a super cheesy mood, but I'm DEFINITELY going back and trying out some of the other grilled cheeses on the menu!"}
{"text":"Wow. The sandwiches here are made perfectly, with the right blend of cheese, sauce, and bread. I ordered the Standard with caramelized onions and garlic aioli. So good!

A must try if you're in Kensington Market and want a quick bite. Great for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Just had a great grilled cheese sandwich. Highly recommend the Feisty Philly! Nice guys at the grill and right in the heart of Kensington Market."}
{"text":"So we got here,  ordered but since they are more worried about their delivery than their in store clients, it took forever from order to delivery.  The food was OK but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to Grilled Cheese in two years and upon arrival there was a banner under the original sign that said \"new owners\"...I'll keep this short, if you are looking for the same quality and taste as the old owners, you will NOT find it here. The menu is has totally changed, the quality of the food and ingredients is very cheap (the bacon tasted like grease and the bread wasn't the same quality). Watching the staff cook the food without any gloves and constantly touching other things around the place while still handing your food was gross. I don't see myself ever returning."}
