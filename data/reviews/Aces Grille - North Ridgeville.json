{"text":"Overpriced and smokey.

Those are the three words I can use to describe this restaurant.  Going into this place, I had a craving for a salad - but after seeing a price tag of $15 for a chef salad, I decided against this option.  Really?  $15 for a salad?  For a salad with lunch meat!?! The stuffed baked potato I went with was good, but brings me to my next point...

Smoking is allowed on the \"enclosed patio tent thing\" towards the front of the restaurant.  The catch is, Aces leaves the patio door wide open, allowing all visitors the delicious smell of second hand smoke while you enjoy your overpriced meal.  Sarcasm.  I left this place needing a shower stat and a washing machine to douse my jeans, sweater, and winter coat."}
{"text":"The food prices are insane!

I stopped having lunch at Aces because a sandwich, iced tea and fries cost north of $15 with the tip.  

The wife ordered 40 wings yesterday with an order of chili bombs and Parmesan Florets (fried broccoli). I was floored when I went to pick the up the food and the bill came to $70.  Yes.... $70 for fried food.  

Next time I will go across the street to Lone Tree and get 4 Prime Rib dinners for less than $60."}
{"text":"As a new resident of the area, my girlfriend and I had heard good things about Aces, so we decided to try it out last night. Stood at hostess stand for about 5 minutes literally in front of staff before anyone acknowledged my existence. After seated, I counted 17 waitresses and 10 minutes before our waitress approached my table to get a drinks. I should note there were only 2 other tables inside with customers seated. The food was over priced ($13 for a burger?) considering the quality. My girlfriend had french onion soup which contained what can only be described as a \"congealed substance of unknown origins\" (I presume it was just old soup) and I had a \"signature\" prime rib wrap that tasted nothing more than a Steak'em for 10x the price. It's obvious this is a place the locals frequent given the inordinate amount of \"high-fiving\" and random hugs with the wait staff. Needless to say, we will not be back in the near future."}
{"text":"It's not what it used to be but I enjoy watching browns games and tribe games here. The beer selection could be a little better. The pizza and Rueben balls are the best here. The only shitty thing about this place is on Saturday nights you have to pay to get in even if you're not watching the shitty cover band. Oh and the police sit on Lorain road across the street waiting for people to leave to give them DUI's"}
{"text":"Alright. I REALLY REALLY REALLY don't like to give bad reviews... but seriously... enough is enough. 
The food is good... but we solely rely on takeout, and the last FIVE TIMES we have ordered here it has been messed up with ZERO apologies or compensation. 
No \"Hey. Yeah. I'm so sorry I didn't put that in correctly!\" or \"Ohmygoodness. We are SO SORRY! The kitchen made an error.\" 
Nothing. Any time. Every time. 
I was a bartender/server for 15 years, and just wow. 

Our business catering and personal home ordering has to officially come to an end."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal visitor of this establishment for 4 years, I would at least stop in every other week for dinner with my family and boast to my friends about their pizza, wings and burgers. Unfortunately yesterday will be my last visit to Ace's for at least a month or so...  The place still has a nice atmosphere and SOME nice staff, however over the last year the waitresses we have come to know and like have all been let go for one reason or the other. The breaking point for me was the lack of quality control on their food and timing, while my son ordered a calzone that was edible it did have enough cheese and pepperoni for 2-3 calzones stuffed inside, some may not see that as a minus but it was just TOO MUCH. Our pizza however was served to us not cooked completely, the middle of the pizza had uncooked dough and I wish I could say this was the first time. I would be more sympathetic if they were busy but for a Tuesday night there was only one other table and some people at the bar and our pizza took over 40 minutes to make it to the table. When we pointed out to the \"new\" waitress she said, \"oh you want it well done?\" Our response was, \"we just want it to be cooked\" 15 minutes later it came out to us with a burnt bottom and burnt toppings, not edible. They took it off the bill but with the amount of time we were there we had to leave and unfortunately picked up fast food to take home. Over the last 3-4 months its been hit or miss with the pizza being cooked like this, trust me when it is done correctly it is fantastic which is why we keep playing roulette with this place. The other issue that has happened is that when we place our orders sometimes the items come back missing a topping here or there and when we ask where it is the popular answer is, \"we are out\". That seems crazy to me when you order a Chicken Club wrap and its missing avocado or bacon which is a main ingredient, I would like to know in advance so I can order something else. Chalk it up to wait staff that is always changing every couple of weeks and I guess that's where the issue may be but as a customer I should get what I order.

My first review of this place was back in 2013 when we first started coming there, great atmosphere, nice wait staff and great/pizza and burgers. Unfortunately I have to take a break from this place and hopefully things get better down the line..."}
{"text":"Food was not bad but the service was rather slow. A good place to drink and watch some sports. The patio was large enough to hold a crowd also. May or may not return."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed today when I stopped in for lunch.  I ordered a half order grilled buffalo chicken salad.  It came with black olives which weren't listed in the menu.  I sent it back and when it returned I was very under whelmed.  Small portion of lettuce a descent size chicken breast a a few red peppers.  For the half salad it was $8.  No cheese or croutons.  No tomatoes or any other things you would find in a salad.   Won't eat lunch here again."}
{"text":"We have been to ACES a number of times over the last three years. Unfortunately each time it seems like the service and food gets worse and worse. Yesterday was the last straw. It took 20 minutes to get an order placed. We had the Ruben Balls which are normally good, but this time they were still frozen in the center. My wife and I both ordered fish and chips, which tasted like it was simply warmed straight from the freezer in the fryer for maybe 20-30 seconds and then placed onto a plate. The same goes for the fries. It was bland and between warm and room temp. We each took a couple bites and had to go find our waitress. We told her we were not eating it and asked for the check. They charged us full price for the food and told us next time we come back, we should try different dishes. Unfortunately, there won't be a next time. This place may be a nice bar scene, but it is sad at best as a place for lunch."}
{"text":"Thought I would update my review on Aces Bar & Grille although nothing has really changed. Service is still really really slow. Beers are all domestic junk. Miller lite, BL, etc. we are in Cleveland - get some local beers!!

The menu has become so big it's really too much. Pizzas are always fantastic as well as the gyros. I almost always get the big house salad too - although sometimes it's obvious it's been made either the day before or in the morning because the lettuce is wilty and brownish. Yuck. I might suggest making them fresh on the fly. They're getting bad lately....

Patio is nice although you have to want to get lung cancer if you're out there. Smoking is just ridiculous. Maybe install a smoke eater or something. I would love to use the covered patio but I don't want to kill myself."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday at noon.  No other people were in there.  The place looks very tired.  Typical bar food.  Will not be going back any time soon"}
{"text":"We stopped here by chance when we had to pit stop along our drive home after being on the road for awhile  it was next to the gas station and looked like a cool place. They have outdoor seating which is a huge plus for me on a gorgeous day like this day was. 
Using walking in we were greeted by a friendly girl who sat us outside per request. Menus have a good selection and they have a kids menu. The decor is hard to describe as it's mostly rugged and woodsy looking. There are two bars. One inside and one outside. I got the feeling after reading their menu and entertainment pamphlet that they do the majority of their business at night and on the weekends. We came at lunch on a Tuesday and there were 10 tables max and mostly business people. I also get the vibe it's a biker bar and I would guess a pretty good one. I'd go for nightlife if I lived there 
Service was a little slow but she did have 6 of the four tables spread through tough the place and the kitchen is slow to prepare food. It took almost two hours from start to finish. That's why 4 stars. 
The food!!  Amazing. Amazing amazing. I had the corned beef in rye with kraut with homemade chips. It was simply out of this world with flavor and those chips. Oh man those chips have a ranch seasoning on them that's to die for. They'll leave you wanting more.  my child ordered tenders and fries. The fries are just as good if not better as those chips. So much so we ordered a basket of just fries. I believe they are made in house as well. We both kept saying how good our meal was. Worth every minute of the 25' wait for food.
Some people wouldn't like the location. It is right off the exit and the road is busy but for me it wasn't an issue. Just being outside with sun is great. 
Go visit eat and have a relaxing time."}
{"text":"We usually go to another local spot to watch sports, but headed to Ace's to \"celebrate\" the beginning of March Madness. The server, Hailey, was great. She was attentive and thorough. We hadn't had their wings, so she brought out the sauce for us to try before we ordered. The boneless wings were average, and the sauce was good. The gyro I ordered was good, and my hubby liked his pizza. The fries left something to be desired. The music wasn't too loud, and my hubby liked the smoking \"tent.\" We will definitely add it to our list of local establishments to frequent."}
{"text":"I've been to Ace's a number of times and I've always wanted to really like this place, but it just never happens.  When they first opened it was a very welcoming spot and the food was good.  Over the course of the last few years I think everyone on the staff:  waitresses, cooks, hostesses, and bartenders have just gotten lazy.  They've now added an \"internet cafe\" which brings in more loud obnoxious people.  

On my last and final visit the service was slow, we waited 10-15 minutes for someone to come to our table and take a drink order.  From that point forward service was average, but the food was horrible.  I had ordered wings and they were very clearly fried and dumped from the fryer to the sauce bowl without draining the grease.  They were then thrown into the basket for serving with the grease.  When the waitress asked how the wings were, I told her they were swimming in grease and not very good.  She simply apologized and made no offer to get a new order or anything.  We had also ordered cheese fries, but they were never brought to the table; they did however show up on the bill.  That was corrected.

The place is LOUD as they fill it with loud music.  The place is typical, nothing special, and honestly I doubt I would return.  For an extra 10 minute drive, I'll go to Fatheads."}
{"text":"I had the buffalo chicken salad.  Perfectly spicy, dress cut lettuce (not from a bag), and the grilled chicken was moist and tender. 

As far as the restaurant, it is clean.  The waitstaff are friendly and efficient.  Lots of televisions here to watch games."}
{"text":"I no longer live near Aces, but try to stop when I'm in the area. Figures...I moved away when they expanded their beer selection.  (Geez... beer selection is seriously a theme with me!)

I digress...good menu. I've never been unhappy with any selection. Their pizzas are really great. Salads are generous, and have very fresh toppings.  The wings are very good, and the provolone wheel is amazing.  Cardiologists recommend it so they can buy bigger boats.  

I don't really get the gaming machines recently added... I don't like those.  Eh.. something for everyone I guess.  

Outdoor patio is heated, and quite nice, considering it faces a busy Lorain Ave.  

Hosteses leave a bit to be desired.  But hey... you only have to deal with them a few minutes.  Waitresses are usually pleasant.  

The food is just that good.  Enjoy.  :)  Have a pizza."}
{"text":"Aces has moderately \"glammed\" up the otherwise drab North Ridgeville area which in itself is a feat.  Located near I80/480 Aces is easy to get to, or from (in case you need a speedy get-a-way from a 40something in his baseball pants who's been chugging beers since 6pm).

HUGE serving sizes, (football sized loaded baked potatoes anyone?), take their menu items up a notch and the lobster claw machine (you catch it they cook it) will have you feeling like a kid again.  During the day this place is perfectly acceptable for family and at night they offer live music and more to keep you entertained."}
{"text":"Great food. Great staff. I highly recommend this place. My grandfather loves their calamari."}
{"text":"I've come here before and have been underwhelmed.  I mean, how can you screw up bar food?

The answer to that question can be found here at Aces Grille. 

Got the \"Ultimate Chips\" and wings.  

Chips were cut so thin that they barely held together when you picked them up to eat.  The \"melted cheddar cheese\" is some kind of canned cheese sauce, not melted shredded cheddar.  Also, no Pepper Jack cheese on it all, even though it was advertised.  

Paid $14.95 for 15 underwhelming wings. I asked them for extra crispy wings, but they weren't.  The \"sauce\"?  I'm not sure what's up but it was all on the bottom of the serving tray and it was watery(?).   Never seen that before.  The wings had no taste of sauce at all. 

I would like to say \"you get what you pay for\" but I'm not sure that's the case here.  $40 spent and i left most of the food on the table.  

Server was friendly, but clearly people usually leave behind large amounts of food they ordered because it didn't occur to her to ask if there was a problem."}
{"text":"Their wings are great. Go Monday or Tuesday after 7 and you can get 25 cent wings. :) - not too shabby. They have many delectable flavors. 

We have always had good service here. Just be careful. Cops like to watch this place to pull people over. (Or at least that's what everyone has told us.)"}
{"text":"Under average food and sticky menus. Won't be my new hangout.


I ordered the turkey club. My turkey was burnt and had no flavor. My drink refill took over 10 minutes to come.

Save your money and order in Chinese food. :-)"}
{"text":"I've been to Aces on many occasions,I find that it's a good bar with an above average menu, and service that's truly hit or miss.

There's other reviews that complain about the food, but quite honestly, I have yet to find an establishment in the area that is even on par or exceeds the quality of Aces food offerings (for a bar).

I like their laid back atmosphere, lottery kiosks and outdoor bar that segregates the smokers."}
{"text":"We ordered carry out once and they got the order wrong.  Unfortunatly
I didn't catch the mistake until I got home. Drove back out and no one even apologized.  They acted like it was my fault.  I've been there other times and eaten there, at the bar the service was fine.  Kind of a strange place.  You'll find bar flies dressed to the nines on the prowl, rednecks, families, trailer trash, etc.  It's like the bar Toby Keith sings about in \"I love this bar!\"

Not a place I frequent, but a good place for people watching on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty good. They have a large covered patio which I think makes the restaurant really cold and smell like smoke. Our waitress was nice. The drinks were good. I got a house salad which was very large for small salad but it was all iceberg lettuce. We all got wings which were good but nothing amazing. Overall sub par bar food."}
{"text":"Awesome food, horrible service. If you are in a hurry don't come here. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Stop in for dinner and was seated by the hostess. We were given menus but we never saw our waitress. Thought maybe they she forgot about us and it was a simple mistake. After a half hour and the other tables in the section were complaining about their wait. We left and so did the other two groups. Aces was nothing but a bust."}
{"text":"4 stars for the wings alone. Plus they have Guinness on tap! Everytime we have been there we have had very good service. Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"I'll say this, the food here is always solid. Not outstanding, not boring, but consistent, and decent.  I'll admit, I've never had their pizza, but the wings are good, as are their sandwiches.  It's one of the more pricey places in the area to eat, but the portion sizes are decent, for adults.

If you have mid sized kids, you may want to avoid this place.  The kids portions are small ($4.99 for a small, and I'm almost talking tea cup sized bowl of Kraft Mac n cheese as an example).  If you have toddlers, you'll be fine, but go early, because the place gets noisy.

Downside, it is very expensive to drink with your meals here, I'm not talking just alcohol, $2.50 for a soda or other soft drink for the kids.  They may run beer or other specials, but they're not well advertised, and their draft beers/bottles are slightly/well above market price ($5 for a 12 oz Seeetwater IPA, ouch!)

Service always seems to be a crapshoot whether you're sitting at the bar, or a table.  Great one time, non existent the next, even when it's not crowded.  

They typically have bands on weekends, either Fridays, Saturdays, or both.  They do charge a cover for when bands are playing, so if you're just looking to get something to eat while they have a band, you would be wise to go elsewhere.

They do have a really large patio, so summertime can bring fresh air dining, but summertime also brings sports teams.  They are directly across from Victory Park, and they can have an insane amount of baseball/softball/whatever types of teams during the day.  Victory park seems to have tournaments every weekend, so it may be crowded.  Lone Tree Tavern down the road, and this place are closest in proximity to the fields.

Overall, and more often than not, I end up with buyer's remorse when I've gone here.  It's nothing bad all at one time, but there is a reason most locals avoid coming here, that doesn't necessarily include North Ridgeville police presence on Lorain Road."}
{"text":"Food not bad..but service makes it not worth the trip. Bar maid practically ignored us to talk and drink with friends at the bar..when asked for more condiments..she sighed and acted like it was out of her job to do those things...I live close..but will drive further just to have better Service"}
{"text":"Service is shitty. Food is good, the pizza is amazing! I get their corned beef every year... Like any bar, there are some older regulars who need to be cut off, their borderline Chester-molester like behavior to the bartenders is obnoxious!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night party of 4. Our experience was very poor. We waited 10 min just to be acknowledged to start off with. The next thing we heard was what sounded like a intense argument coming from the back. Loud enough we all could hear it. 
The food came out about 30 min after we ordered and some were cold. The fries tasted like the oil wasn't changed in months. The plates and silverware were dirty as were the bathrooms. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Visiting Aces again and while their food is better than middle of the road something has happened to the quality and to the luster of this place. Don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I live fairly close to Ace's, so when I want to drink near home, I figured this would be a good spot to hangout at. WRONG. I've to Ace's once or twice before this past weekend and it was just okay. But this time was pretty bad. 

We sat at a table by the bar and no one served us so we had to keep going back up to the bar to get drinks. Finally after about an hour we stopped someone and asked for a menu. We ordered the fried ravioli, which was bland and in a mess of sauce and they got the wings (which apparently they really liked--so maybe I would give 2.5 stars for that) 

Anyways, the amount of shady and trashy people made this bar get two stars solely for our wild entertainment, I mean my mom was in tears. Some people realllly should not get drunk and dance in public...But hey, if you're looking for some good, free entertainment, you probably will find it at Ace's!"}
{"text":"Food tasted great. Waitress was awesome. We waited an hour and a half for food, the manager came out and told us he would take 50% off our bill for our wait, but only ended up taking off 10% and was extremely rude! We did have a big fast pitch  group, it was busy and understaffed. But we had 4 hours to get to the next game and should not have been running out of there!"}
{"text":"After a long day and a baseball game across the street, we figured we would order to go food. We purchased 3 burgers and fries, one man burger and 2 double down burgers. All were supposed to be cooked at medium well and none of them were. The man burger was almost rare and the other burgers were probably medium. It's to bad I couldn't take the burgers back because we live over 12 miles away or could of checked them before I left because 38 dollars for this gross food is terrible! My son couldn't even eat the man burger since it was pretty much raw so peanut butter and jelly it is at 10:30 at night. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really want to mention the great medium three topping pizza thus place has on special for $5. on Wednesday. What a great deal and great pizza. The service is not great but acceptable. But try the pizza. It really is good."}
{"text":"A typical sports bar with many plasma tvs to watch.  The bar is very large and reminds more you of a diner than bar.  Darts and  game room for the kiddies.  It seems like a good place to kill time.

Staff is ok.  Average select of draft beer, and average beer prices.  I recommend the pizza it is slightly above average (very slightly).  

Only draw back is the very high placement of the tvs.  Not exaggerating, easily 12 feet off the ground."}
{"text":"Quick, kind service.  A little loud, but it's a bar, so nothing out of the ordinary...

BUT HOLY &*^% HAVE YOU SEEN THE BAKED POTATO???

Biggest potato I have ever seen in my entire life.  I think it weighed more than my first child - it might weigh more than all of them combined.  I didn't even order it (my awesome Mom did), and I sat there the entire time staring at her potato wondering if one of these potatos could end world hunger.

Good burger too - but I have to tell you i'm a sucker for a burger with jalapenos, so it could have been horrible and I still would have loved it. 

Good beer selection, and the pizza that the people at the next table bought looked and smelled good."}
{"text":"This place has to have the worst bar service ever! I'm at a car show here sitting at the bar hoping for a Diet Coke and something to eat, but I must have taken my invisible pill. I wish the owners had a video system so they could see just how bad things are. They should check the footage from Monday October 2 at 5:35pm at the bar. At this point, I'm going to decline anything as why reward horrible service with business. At least there are some cool cars in the lot."}
{"text":"I live nearby and come here every couple of weeks. The pizza is the best around, so is lobster bisque on Fridays. However the service varies from good to absolutely deplorable! They hire by looks here not talent. I'm posting today because I've gotten two beer mugs covered in lipstick stains. Pretty freaking gross!! Also bring a sweater in the fall and winter, Baby it's cold inside!"}
{"text":"I have been to Aces twice now over the past two weeks and have had a pleasant experience each time they seem to be making an effort to improve.  We ordered pizza an wings each time and the food was excellent and the servers were speedy and polite."}
{"text":"This place is good but the bartenders vary. The added some video slots in their smoking tent...yuck.  Food is good, though, some of the best bar food I've ever had.  I wish they'd fix their crappy sound system because they have live bands frequently and it makes everyone sound distorted.  
Good: pizza, burgers, giant spuds
Mediocre: chicken fingers, fries
Crap shoot: any mixed drink 
Disgusting: smoking \"tent\""}
{"text":"Easy access on Lorain Road btw 480 and Turnpike, Aces has some good stuff going for them. The food is very tasty, with decent wings, good sandwiches and surprisingly great pizza. Their \"Venetian\" Pizza is a white garlic sauce and olive oil with 4 cheeses, sausage, peppers and onions. Different, but in a great way. They have nice patio and live bands most weekends. The service is typical of a bar- as it gets more crowded you will see your waitress less and less. Pretty good beer selection including Yuengling and Christmas Ale on tap. Great people watching too, as there are 50 somethings flirting next to 20 somethings."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and meet up. Very large, lots of TVs. Huge heated patio.  Service is pretty quick.  Good for pizza but nothing amazing when it comes to food.  Wide selection on beers and drinks."}
{"text":"Wings are awesome. We always get hen to go for parties and things and we've never been disappointed. Garlic and BBQ are my favorites."}
{"text":"Live claw machine? Seriously? I work for a vet and volunteer for 2 animal rescues and the sight of that made me sick! Why not throw chickens in a machine as well or let people shoot their own cow out back. The board of health in many other cities have banned these machines gee wonder why? Yuck. I will not go back unless it is to picket your establishment to remove that machine!"}
{"text":"This place overall doesn't deserve much time. While the space is large and the food is above average the service is absolutely atrocious."}
{"text":"Place was more than half empty on a Sunday afternoon and they couldn't seat a party of 10 because the servers were \"too booked\".   Appeared that most people were done eating as well. Guess the servers aren't in to making money."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is typical sports bar, very clean nice big bar. The food menu is pretty large ranging from a variety of foods. Entrees all the way to your typical bar food. Craft Beer selection is pretty weak, only offering a few types of craft beer. The service has been pretty bad the two times I've visited this location, waited 12 minutes for drinks and the place wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Fun, new hang out for my husband and I.  We enjoy eating and a little gambling here.   The food is great and the service rocks...Rachel is our favorite server."}
