{"text":"I always used to come here in high school. $6 for delicious food + a drink. It was also my first time having chili chicken, and I thought it was the most beautiful thing I've ever eaten.   Maybe it's because I've had other hakka restaurants now, but I feel this place is just average. The chicken is still good for a few bites, then starts going downhill. The Manchurian chicken is decent, a good choice when you don't feel like having the chili chicken.   A good place to go if it's your first time having hakka food."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I would say it was pretty standard Chinese fare. The restaurant appeared to be clean. Bring cash with you no credit or debit cards accepted."}
{"text":"This is (unfortunately) the take out place of choice for my parents when they get Chinese food. Everything is greasy and honestly occasionally makes my stomach hurt a little bit. The usual order shanghai fried noodles with chicken, spicy green beans, vermicelli and veggies, beef and vegetables, and lemon chicken is palatable, but the quality seems on a steady decline over the last 10 years. Either that or my expanding culinary horizons have lowered my estimation of this place.  The only thing saving this place from a one out of five is a friendly service that remembers patronage (and food allergies) and fond memories that are quickly fading of walking over here for high school lunch. I sincerely hope it improves. Although it seems to have no trouble surviving with its cheap prices drawing people in still I guess."}
{"text":"If you're going to be cash-only, state it obviously in the menu and put a sign at the door.  The first time I ordered I ordered with a group, we all had cash so we didn't really think about it.  Then we I went to the actual store we placed out huge order, got everything set and then BAM \"No, no, Cash Only.\"  I don't mind it ... but PLEASE, a fair warning would have been nice.  As for the food ... it's average at best.  We've tried general tso, chicken with broccoli, and orange chicken.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Hey, if you are looking for high end atmosphere and amazing customer service. please stop reading. This place has its secrets, never renovate. Give 2 napkins, 2 packets of hot sauce and throw in a spoon and a fork with a HUMONGOUS portion of meat and white rice. I have tried quite a lot of their $6 combo's. However i must say, hands down the Manchurian chicken with extra sauce is by far the champion. Guess what they also give you the option of a soup or drink for that price. This place is packed lunch time."}
{"text":"Best chilli chicken ever. Never tried anything else but by the reviews I guess they suck. The chilli chicken here is amazing. I go here all the time. I have tried many Hakka places. This place is a 10/10. Golden China gets a 6, Fredrick's is 5, tangerines is 7, Lucky's is 6. This place is amazing , but make sure you get the chilli chicken. (Make sure you dine in because for some reason the takeout doesn't taste as amazing)"}
{"text":"Rude, rude, RUDE! And not good food. I'm not just basing this on one visit. I will always give a second chance. The second time I visited, it was worse!   And to SanMeGal K: Before you go calling names, I ordered it take-out both times."}
{"text":"This use to be my WEEKLY hot spot all through high school, the reason was because I use to live on Lee Ave and it was a short walk to great comfort food. This was the first place I experience Hakka Food, my favourite dish was the chili chicken on rice. The quantity usually lasted two days or two different meals in my house because it was way too much for one person. Another dish that was regularly ordered was the beef fired noodles, and the vegetable fried noodles.  I enjoyed the fact that every time I walked in I felt very welcomed and treated like a regular. Every time I had friends and family over that wanted to grab a quick bite to eat, I would place the call and by the time I walked over there it would be ready.  I use to get the Monday - Friday lunch special deal which was $5 for a container of whichever choice you picked (usually the chili chicken on rice) and it would come with a drink.  I haven't been there since I have moved but plan on making a visit real soon."}
{"text":"I have been there quite  a few times and it's always been good . They don't seem rude at all they do speak broken English so maybe that's the reason for other bad reviews  maybe alittle understanding  should come into play  I will keep coming back. Glad to have a good place like this close to home"}
