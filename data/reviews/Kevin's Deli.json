{"text":"Kevin deli is a small hole in the wall located inside Webster Hall. The space is small, so there's no sitting area. You can place your order for pick up or delivery.  Ordered a garden burger with fries. Very nice veggie patty served on a nice and soft bun. Fries were ok, nothing special. Great food especially for the prices. Total meal costed less than $7.  Its a great option for lunch. Awesome value for the price. Definitely recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Kevin's Deli is a great little place for lunch!  Just had the steak salad.  All the veggies were very fresh, crisp, hot fries and perfectly cooked steak!  It was delicious!  Prices are very reasonable!  Kevin is a super nice guy...always smiling and talking to his customers!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!  Had lunch here a couple of times.   Food is always hot, fresh and delicious!  Kevin is a very nice guy!  Very reasonable prices.  Don't bypass this one folks!"}
{"text":"Really great for an out of towner! Found Kevin's on yelp and decided to give it a try after visiting Phipps. Small little place but really know how to do business. Very patient while we figured out what to order and didn't feel rushed at all. Prices are phenomenal, but the chicken hoagie was out of this world. If I am ever in the area again, Kevin's deli will be on my list of places to stop. I really hope they expand their business and space to accommodate for their future success"}
{"text":"I just started working in the websterhall building. They told me there was a deli downstairs and I went to check it out. The food smelled great and the prices were affordable. I decided to try a tuna melt.... After my first bite I KNEW working at this job I would welcome 5 pounds because of Kevin's DELI downstairs  thanks for a great first experience! It was delicious !"}
{"text":"This place does not do dine in because it's a small cozy little place in Webster hall. But they do pickup, takeout and delivery, which is even better. This is my first time to Kevin's and was treated w a free pen, a buy 7 get 1 free card and a homemade pound cake ( or a free drink, I chose the cake, which was soon proved to be the right decision!) with my order. I ordered a grilled Reuben sandwich and it was soooo good, much better than the one I had in Eat unique in South Craig ave. Unlike the overly grilled bread I got in Eatunique, the bread here was grilled to perfection. The homemade pound cake is really good, too. Ok! Decision made: this place will be my future lunch place!"}
{"text":"This is a gem hidden away (maybe too far away) in Webster Hall off of Fifth in Oakland. I worked a block away for three years and had no idea it was even there until another graduate student gave me the menu before he finished his degree and said, \"this is my secret that I'm passing on to you.\" So, for better and/or worse, I'm letting the cat out of the bag here. This is the best cheap food you will find in all of Oakland for lunch (or breakfast). It's funny, the first time I ordered from them I called beforehand and ordered a veggie burger and some fries and told them I'd walk over to pick it up (they also deliver within 3 or so blocks)- and I couldn't even find the place after walking through the maze of Webster! After finally getting there, I walked into the little kitchen and there were a bunch of guys there just hanging out. Don't let the small space fool you... it's got a big heart, as well as the cook there (.... I'm not sure if it was Kevin). He was super nice and after I told him I had gotten lost and it was my first time eating there, he gave me a free dessert and told me to come back soon! I mean, who can beat $3 for a well cooked and tasty veggie burger and fries for less than $2? And the food was great! Since then, I have been back a couple of times. I recommend calling your order in first. They also do a mean breakfast, from bagels to hot stuff like omelets and hash browns. The one con to this place is that it closes pretty early in the afternoon, I think around 4 or so. I've been working late a couple of times and called over for dinner and I was super bummed (as well as my stomach) that they had already closed for the day."}
{"text":"TIP! On N. Dithridge St there's a navy blue awning with I think \"Webster hall?\" Written on it. Go in that entrance and it's immediately to the left!  Kevin is awesome and super nice. First time there and I was kind of craving a deli turkey sandwich not some overpriced artisan bs and he delivered with a solid simple deli sandwich. And if you like deviled eggs you'll love the potato salad. (I love deviled eggs.)  The menu is really vast with both fried and breakfast items and obviously deli sandwiches and salads. Don't let the small venue fool you!   This locale has great reviews for a reason. And apparently they have an outstanding fish sandwich if you're into that!   Not to mention the prices are 100% affordable. 10/10 I'll be a weekly regular at Kevin's. And follow him on Instagram!   P. S. They DELIVER! Check out Grubhub and if you sign up for the first time I think you get a deliver credit or something, also there're obvs delivering via Yelp Eat24."}
{"text":"A not-too-expensive, delicious reuben half a block away from where I work?! Score! I haven't tried anything other than the reuben yet, but I don't know if I ever will because it's so good and filling. Perfect comfort food for a cold day and you can't beat the price. I always ask for the dressing on the side. I ordered online and it was ready in about 10 minutes. I work a block away so it's super convenient. They're always friendly. I wish they had sweet potato fries on their menu. Then it would be perfect."}
{"text":"I had the chef salad. Large salad with lots of delicious ham, turkey, and cheese. The ranch dressing tasted homemade. Very filling but I couldn't stop eating!"}
{"text":"Food was top tier and was delivered to my house around 9 am. Was a fanatastic way to fill up on a nice meal before midterms."}
{"text":"This hidden gem should be on everyone's list!  Kevin runs a busy place but he makes time to chat up his customers. And his food is great.  The gyros (Jie-rows) were delicious."}
{"text":"It's at a rather unfortunate location, away from the direct field of vision of the passersby. Unless you intentionally look for it, it's kind of hard to find. I think they need a bigger/flashier sign! Kevin's deli is literally a hole in the wall inside of Webster hall. You have to go inside Webster and then follow the scent to Kevin's deli where all the magic happens.   I was a bit skeptical when I first walked in because it looks kind of sketchy. But the chef (I assume that's Kevin) greeted me with a warm smile and pointed me to the specials of the day. I ordered the chicken hoagie with a side of fries. Kevin was nice enough to throw in a free drink with my order. Thanks for the free drink Kevin! The chicken hoagie was delicious, filled with shredded chicken, onions, lettuce and creamy mayo. The fries were probably my favorite though...sooooo crispy and fresh!   Overall, I highly recommend stopping by Kevin's Deli for a lunch sandwich if you're in the Oakland area. Prices are extremely affordable! I spent around $6 for my hoagie and fries. Kevin himself is such a funny and enthusiastic guy who cares a lot about his business. That's what I love most about small businesses!"}
{"text":"This is probably the cheapest place to get a good filling meal or snack quickly. The best thing is the service. Kevin provides good company while he cooks and is very generous. This was the first time I went there  and he gave me a free drink and potato salad.  The veggie burger I got was big and good. It wasn't the best veggie burger I've had but still very satisfying."}
{"text":"This was my go-to when I lived in Webster Hall - perfect for a quick bite of deli-style goodness after a long day of classes.   I'm not going to lie, the food isn't top-notch quality, but it gets the job done (especially if the job is satiating a hungry, grumpy student.) I ordered gyros on the regular here and very adamantly looked the other way when the meat was taken out of the freezer, instead of off a rotating spit. What brought me back day after day wasn't the food; it was the engaging, personable staff. Kevin is just the sort of delightful, cheery person who can raise your mood after a grueling day (read: every day in graduate school.)   Be prepared to wait in line, since this place is a favorite among Webster Hall residents and tenants from neighboring apartments!"}
{"text":"Kevin's Deli is this amazing little place that can be found in Webster Hall in Oakland.  The easiest way to find it is to turn down N. Dithridge Street from Fifth Ave and pull off to the left into the loading zone.  (You'll see the deli's window on the first floor to the left of the entrance.)  Enter Webster Hall at this entrance and you'll find Kevin's Deli to the left.   I'm not sure how I first learned about Kevin's Deli, but I suspect it was one of the few reviews here on Yelp.  Shortly after, a Groupon became available so I jumped on the chance.  Not that the Groupon was necessary since Kevin's Deli is super-cheap.  Most items on the menu are $5 or less.  It's a bargain but well worth it.  Kevin knows what he's doing with the simple things.  Like the Turkey Bacon Club with fresh turkey and bread that is toasted to perfection.  I don't know where he gets his steak or what he does to it when he cooks it but I've had both the steak pita and the steak hoagie with fries and been amazed at how great it tastes.  I will be back to try some of the other items I've read are good.  Like the chicken salad, pasta salad or even that pound cake.  He also offers many breakfast items but I think most people go in for the lunch sandwiches.  I suspect that most of his business comes from local businesses and college students.  Don't go late (Kevin's Deli closes at 4:30pm) or on the weekend (open Monday through Friday).  You may be confused because he operates out of a very small room that was likely someone's office at one time.  But if it's lunch time and you're in Oakland, you can't go wrong for the price.  Kevin's Deli may be small like the prices, but the taste is bigger than you'd expect."}
{"text":"This place smells like heaven and the food doesn't disappoint. I would recommend trying everything here and at theses prices you would be hard pressed to find a better eating establishment."}
{"text":"Oh my. So finding the place was a little difficult, but as everyone says, it's right inside Webster Hall. If you enter using the doors near those tables outside, it's inside on the left.  I had the wingdings and fries, and they were fabulous. Reminded me of the wings I used to get back home in Alabama. The guys working were super nice, and I will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu. Btw, breakfast is served the whole time they're open!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Kevin's Deli this past Wed. to pick up lunch.  Despite being all of a block away from my apt., I'd never had occasion to stop by before due to its slightly inconvenient and out-of-the-way location within Webster Hall.  I was unable to get to the grocery store last weekend, however, and subsequently ended up running out of (real) food by midweek, leading me to stop by and purchase a proper lunch on my way to work.  After perusing the menu, I decided to order one of the daily specials: a grilled ham-and-cheese with a side of macaroni salad.  The price, at $6.25, was right, but I was able to get it below $6 with the application of a Yelp deal for first time customers.  My lunch took between 5-10 min. to prepare, and was served nicely packaged in a brown bag for transport and later consumption.  The sandwich itself wasn't huge, but was sufficiently filling for me, and rather tasty, if a bit salty.  The macaroni salad had a creamy consistency and included pieces of diced hard-boiled egg among the tender noodles.  Its flavor initially struck me as a bit sweet for my taste, but it grew on me and I ended up enjoying it.  Overall, I was pretty satisfied with my lunch from here.  The one major turn-off was the service--after I walked in, the guy taking orders took several phone calls before taking my order.  This seems to be common practice at eateries that do most of their business via delivery, but the staff should learn that it's courteous to take the order of walk-in customers after finishing their current call rather than answering the next call.  Given that this was my first visit, though, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and would return--though I might call in my order next time."}
{"text":"You know what I enjoy about Yelp?  Finding something new to me in the city.  That's exactly what happened with this place.  I could have walked by this place a million times, and not noticed it.  In fact I probably just did that.  It's somewhat a tiny place in a room inside Webster Hall.  It's not at the front of the building on Fifth, it is on the Dithridge side, and there is really no sign to find it.  Once you walk inside it feels like you are in a medical office building.  Quiet is the sound, so thank god you can follow the smell.  My coworkers wanted to order out again at work, and to them, it's OK to keep going to the same old places and getting the same old thing.  But not me, I was willing to go to a place if I had to to pick up something to eat.  Whenever my coworkers suggest something, I head to Yelp and do a search for nearby places, I wanted a deli, and that's exactly what I found.  They have a menu on the site, so that made it easy to figure out what all we wanted.  Calling the the order was pleasant as well, and working in Oakland made it easy to get here in the allotted amount of time it would take for the food to be ready.  I arrived, parked, was walking to the door, and noticed a sign, on 8 x 11 paper, and the owner looking out the window with a smile on his face.  The smile continued as I walked in the door, and without missing a beat was greeted.    The food was ready, and being packaged as I entered.  The owner and his son were both in the shop and making chit chat with me.  I was asked how I stumbled upon their spot and told them I found them on Yelp.  I was informed that I was the first person to come in their shop that found them that way.  They were excited by that.    The food, my god the food, was very delicious.  I opted for the turkey club with a side of Cole slaw.  The sandwich was stacked high with turkey.  I really wanted to call it a turkey BLT.  The bacon on this sandwich was cooked to the point that it basically melted on your tongue, the tomatoes and lettuce were quite fresh and the bread was toasted perfectly.  The Cole slaw was prepared to perfection as well.  Right up there with 'made like mom's.' My coworkers were happy with their orders as well.    Few tips:  hours vary from day to day, check their website; if you are coming to pick up your food, park in the loading zone (you'll bypass a ticket by hoping you don't take too long picking up food), they do deliver, but only until 4 pm, first time orderers get a little extra something when you arrive.  So people of the Oakland section of the city, make you way here to enjoy some of the best deli fare Pittsburgh has to offer."}
{"text":"One reason I miss living, working, and going to school in Oakland is because of Kevin's Deli.  Now the only time I can get here is on a day off.    The food is soo good! Breakfast and lunch, delicious! Sadly, a lot of people may not know about it because it's not visible from the street where it's located in Webster Hall.  I heard about it via word of mouth years ago.  I recommend calling ahead as lunch time can get pretty busy.    Kevin and Roger are awesome and super friendly.  I love the Buffalo chicken salad, but you can't miss with the other entrées.  When there's pound cake available, make sure you get a slice.  The deli is small with no seating inside.  There are tables outside of Webster Hall though.  Street parking is available nearby.  Cash and cards are accepted."}
{"text":"For lunch, if you don't call to place an order or put it online, it can be a little bit of a wait. But if you call ahead, like I've started doing, you will not be disappointed. It is the best lunch time burger I have ever had. The staff is so kind and considerate. I have met Kevin before, and he is so fantastic to the customers.   I get their cheese burger, but their chicken sandwich is also fantastic. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Eat here! The staff is friendly and helpful. The potato salad is perfect and the sandwiches are tasty. Eat local, not chain."}
{"text":"I love this place! Easy to get to and the food is always comforting and delicious. Steak salads are great! The guys are always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"First time ordering from Kevin's Deli. Took awhile to get our delivery. Kevin himself delivered it and gave us drinks for free. The fried chicken strips and fries were warm when we got them which is good considering it was cold outside. The chicken was crispy and tender, not dry and the fries were good. The prices are great for the area and would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"It took me a long time to get here and I wish I had come here sooner!     The sandwiches were filling, the service was incredibly nice and generous, and the price and location are perfect for college kids. The deli is right in Webster Hall (you may get a little turned around) but just keep walking and you'll find those golden gates/ a sign that says Kevin's Deli...  I got the tuna salad and he even threw in a bag of chips since it was my first time going! The meal was filling with any choice of bread (white, wheat, and rye) with lettuce and tomato.  I loved my tuna salad, perfectly creamy and not too fishy.  I definitely want to go again and by the end of the year I'll hopefully eat everything on the menu. Everything."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find unless you work in the building.  Kevin's Deli is inside of Webster Hall in Oakland and it's a great little deli that I've done for lunch many times.  Prices are really cheap and there's a surprisingly large menu selection given the tiny size of the place.  Anything from deli sandwiches, to hamburgers, to omelets, to fried food.  There is no seating so everyone orders to go and I think most people work in the building or next door.  I believe they also do delivery but haven't used it.  The owner who runs the place is friendly and so are the other staff."}
{"text":"A truly hidden gem in the heart of Oakland!  Kevin is not only a great deli cook, he's a delightful host.  This was my first visit to Kevin's Deli.  he recommended the Chicken Hoagie and I was not disappointed.  The sandwich and fries were hot and freshly made to order.  Keep in mind there is no seating inside so it's definitely a \"To Go\" or dine outside location but worth the effort. Call ahead if you are in more of a hurry.  Next time I am trying the omelette!"}
{"text":"I got to try Kevin's Deli when I was in town for a dental school interview at Pittsburgh. I came across this fine gem on Yelp. It was located near my hotel nestled in a little apartment complex?-- it was a little difficult to find...but I'm glad I did! This small shop has a large menu with some of the happiest workers that Ive ever encountered. The food was delicious and Kevin recommended that I try the Steak Hoagie. Very good! Since it was my first visit Kevin let me grab whatever I wanted to drink---On him! It was their great attitude and good food that motivated me to write this review. Heck I would go to this place just to put myself in a good mood! Their upbeat attitude and comforting food gave me a sense of 'mood therapy' that made the end of my trip to Pittsburgh great!    Thanks Guys"}
{"text":"Love there pasta salad as well as their egg salad...sandwiches are great too but I wish they used thicker sandwich bread instead of the kind you would buy when packing your kids lunch. They offer decent specials and combos and a cooler full of lots of drinks.   No place to sit inside the building but there are four picnic tables with umbrellas outside that would work just fine, only if it summer of course  Nice lil deli snack place for in between class quick lunch..:)"}
{"text":"Kevin's Deli is fantastic, and Kevin himself is such an awesome and charismatic guy with over-the-top service and food quality.   My GF and I were visiting from Portland, OR, and in search of quality, local, non-chain food experiences in Pittsburgh.   Kevin's deli is a wonderful little hole-in-the-wall. We thoroughly enjoyed his tuna salad and chicken pita, which we would recommend to anyone. His outgoing and positive personality was a nice treat as well. Definitely one of the best values in the city for food quality, service, and price."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Specially for the price. I paid $5 for an awesome fish sandwich. The staff were more than friendly  The place itself is small and it has no seats but there are seats outside the building. It might not be perfect for rainy wheather. This didn't cause me to lower my review. But, If you are really picky on the architectural designs and comfyness of the place you might want to reconsider going there. The food is definitely great for the price.   I will definitely go there again. We tried the fish sandwich, grilled reuben and steak hoagie and all was very tasty. I would suggest all. Just, the Reuben was a smaller sandwich."}
{"text":"Great random find inside Webster Hall. Seriously,  check it out for lunch. Cheap food, small dive, takes card,prices are great."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. And you will get cravings, trust me! Great people making great food!"}
{"text":"It took me a while to find this place. Kevin's Deli is located inside Webster Hall, and is very small and easy to miss. I ordered the daily features (special) which were (1) chicken tenders and onion rings and (2) steak and fries salad. As a first time customer, I was offered a free can of soda or bottled water. The people were extremely amicable, explaining what each menu item was in detail.  Unfortunately, what I ordered was not what I received. Instead of the steak and fries salad, I got the steak hoagie and fries. In terms of the quality of food, the meal was satisfying. The hoagie wasn't too greasy. The fries were a bit lackluster, and could be crispier. With regard to the chicken tenders and onion rings, they were neither bad nor good. The tenders were a little dry, but the barbecue sauce really enhanced it's flavor. The onion rings weren't special, and were very similar to that of Burger King's. Overall, the food here did not meet expectations."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time but kept putting it off and I finally got around to it today!! It was a little difficult to find since I went into the entrance of Webster Hall along fifth ave, so I had to go all the way around inside. But save yourself the headache and just go into the entrance to Webster Hall on N. Dithridge and it's immediately to your left when you enter.  I walked in and was happily greeted by Kevin and there was another employee and customer chatting on the inside. The environment is very relaxed and chill. When he found out it was my first time there, he gave me a free soda or bottled water. How nice!! Everyone was very polite the entire time. I ordered the chicken tenders and fries which were $6.00 and then some coleslaw which was $2.75; they accept cards here. It's a decent sized portion of coleslaw and it's delicious, tastes similar to the way that KFC makes theirs. The tenders and fries were piping hot and delicious!   Next time I want to try one of the hoagies, they look super delicious in all of the photos here on Yelp. And I definitely will be coming back here! Kevin was so nice and it's definitely a small space as there's nowhere to sit and eat, but the portion sizes are big and it's good and it's AFFORDABLE!  I didn't mean to eavesdrop on the conversation that was being had amongst the other three in the restaurant, but one of the customers was a struggling artist and Kevin and the other worker were encouraging him to keep up with his art and to keep growing despite being discouraged by the works of other \"better\" artists. Hearing this conversation just made my heart so full. Everyone deserves friends like that! I will definitely be coming back here to try more of their food!!"}
