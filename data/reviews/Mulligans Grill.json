{"text":"Food was awesome!  For our appetizer we had the potato skins - so flavorful , the green chili pork with pico de gallo - OMG!  I had the simple cobb salad - romaine lettuce, tomatoes, egg, bacon, blue cheese crumbles, cucumber, avocado, red onions. Couldn't finish all of it in one sitting - beautifully prepared, and quite tasty. My husband had the Cubano sandwich and it came with homemade chips - which were so great - I ate several of them too - you know potato chips- you can't eat just one!  We will definitely be back again. Nice neighborhood place to eat, relax, watch tv, and look out the windows and watch the golfers. Friendly wait staff. All around great place to stop in for food and drinks."}
{"text":"Such a freaking great experience today.  My brother and I stopped in for a beer and appetizer. Great food and great service.  Ariel was phenomenal and the manager was as well."}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday for the first time and we will not be returning. I ordered the mac and cheese and it was not as was described on the menu. It was boxed kraft mac and cheese. Even our waitress commented on it. The stew my husband had was nothing to write home about. As for the bar, our backyard bar has more variety than this place. Don't go, you would be happier at home."}
{"text":"Wife got the Cubano and I got the blue cheese burger and a few tacos and Dos Equis. Food was really great and definitely glad we came by, sat on the outdoor patio and enjoyed ourselves!"}
{"text":"I have to tell you, I just found a place that has awesome food, service, and staff. I have played golf here for years and my wife and i just came in for lunch and had the best burger and roasted veggie quesadilla with green Chile pork. Ask for Lisa from St Paul Mn, she took care of us with an awesome smile."}
{"text":"This place don't deserve any stars severs are so unreliable and slutty the food is Ok nothing special you can go anywhere and get better flavor. Its an ok hangout spot. Not much to say."}
{"text":"We eat here quite often, and I have to tell you that the wings and burgers are fantastic!

Last night we met the manager (Jay) and he could not be any nicer.

Great food, cold beer, and a great place to watch the game.

We will be back."}
{"text":"Sat for 20 minutes with no attention at all. No menu, no water. On a Saturday evening asked for a margarita when someone finally came over to be told there out. The place was practically empty which should have been a clue."}
{"text":"Wow, the food and service was excellent. I come here quite often with family or friends, and every time we have a very great experience. Highly recommended it to anyone, especially for holiday!"}
{"text":"On March 3, 2017, we were at Western Skies Golf Course, Mulligans Restaurant, in Gilbert, for their regular Friday night, all-you-can-eat fish fry, for $11.  We go there often and this night we were a party of 11 people, all seniors.  There was live music with a band called The Cover Ups on the outside patio, but we were inside so we could converse.  We arrived at 5:20, made first drink order about 5:30 and ordered food about 5:50.  Happy hour drinks were strong enough, but second round was slow in coming, and we were never asked if we wanted a third round.  Water was supplied, but never refilled.  

The food came out about 7:05, 7:10, 7:15, and 7:20.  That's about 75 minutes from time of order, and 15 minutes from the first food to the final.  The normal fish fry serving is two good-sized pieces of fried or grilled (or one of each), potato chips, and a dollop of cole slaw.  This night the grilled fish came as one small (1 1/2\" X 3\") piece, warm not hot.  Those who ordered one grilled and one fried got two pieces.  My second order of fried fish was hot and large and I had the sense to order it when my first order came.  Three of our group got a bowl of chowder and two of the bowls were warm (not hot), one was so cold it had to be sent back, and one came without the accompanying piece of bread.  One of our group was afraid to eat her second piece of grilled fish because it tasted raw to her.

We wondered if the management knows how to run a restaurant.  You can't chalk it up to an unusually busy night because this is their regular Friday night fare.  There were probably four or five empty tables inside and, due to the band, the patio was probably full.  Our server was trying to service tables all over the inside dining room as well as on the patio, and she was practically in tears.  Incredibly, the manager appeared to be walking around instead of filling-in and helping.  

Any one of these issues might have been forgivable, but there were so many, and they could have been avoided.  If you don't have enough servers, close sections to give adequate service to those you seat or at least warn patrons that service may be delayed.  If you are short on a menu item, don't take orders for that item instead of making minuscule portions.  If service is slow, don't set-out food until it can be served.  

We complained and it appears that most of our checks were reduced by about 10 percent by removing a drink or side dish from the bill.  Is that adequate?  You can decide that for yourself, but it will be a long while before we return."}
{"text":"We usually like to come here every now and then for breakfast. Our experience has been for the most part very good however, today the chef was off his/her game. Whomever it was thought it was a good idea to serve under cooked pancakes and serve very dried beef short ribs on the Benedict. Unacceptable! The waitress was pretty good. Just keep in mind that they don't provide you with spins unless you ask for them. I don't know why? It's a little annoying at breakfast with no coffee spoon."}
{"text":"Sat out on the patio to get some lunch.  The food was so good! Our entire party enjoyed their meals!! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"The food is so great here. The daily specials are all awesome! And the staff is top shelf. I eat here quite often and have always been satisfied with the quality and service at Mulligans!"}
{"text":"Sorry these jerks can dish it out and not take it.the food is awful and their manager is to busy chasing around 20 year olds to do his job.i wrote a previous review about my awful experience and they removed it.well the truth hurts you jerks."}
{"text":"I usually do not do negative reviews but if you want service here do not come! The line at the bar is 25min and we sat at our table for over almost two hours and was never acknowledged. 
We went to hang out with friends and listening great music. So that gets 5 stars.
But if there is an event do not come here!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's my home away from home.  Servers and management go out of there way to make you feel like you're part of a private club.  Great sports bar. Great food, great staff... can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and so is the staff! I love the patio and the laid back atmosphere. You gotta try their breakfast too. Everything is spot on!"}
{"text":"Waited at least 30 minutes for them to clean a table in a half empty restaurant. Another 20 minutes for them to come take our order only for them to then tell me they are out of the special. So I let the kids order and I order chips and salsa as an appetizer. 30 min later I ask the lady if we can please get the appetizer.  She finally brings the chips and salsa, no napkins. Terrible service. 5+ servers walking around and only about 10 tables and still poor service. Nice patio, good music. Not worth the $15 burger."}
{"text":"We LOVE Mulligan's Grill @ Western Skies! The holiday bunches are always Fantastic! Food is Delicious and service outstanding!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast again yesterday.  Still good and delicious.  Used a restaurant.com voucher.  When I got home, I got a notice from restaurant.com that Mulligan's is no longer participating in the discount voucher program....good thing I got to use my voucher.  I guess I have to pay full price next time we visit."}
{"text":"We have been here twice for dinner, will return.  We sit on the patio.  It has been so nice.  The service is excellent, the prices are very reasonable and the food has been very good.  I have had the chicken salad sandwich and I very much liked that.   It is refreshing to have a new variety of bar food although it is not really just a bar it is a grill.  Last night I had the prime rib dinner and it was perfect and delouse. Comes with mash tators but I had to opt out of those but the grilled vegies were really good and good variety.   My husband had the cheeseburger, looked soooo good.  Hand press burger, fresh bun, and he had their chips.  He very much liked them, he said they are not too thick and soaked in grease like a lot of places do chips.  With a nice patio and good weather we enjoy our new find."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood grill. Good food at a good value. We always come here with our kids. The kids meals are large and our kids like all of them. Casual, drink specials, and the food is really good. Got a free app for checking in which was really wonderful! We chose the chicken chips and salsa and it was amazing! Thanks Mulligans! We'll be back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"We went in for the 'All you can eat' fish fry.  It was 2:30 pm, about 5 tables occupied and at least 3 people working. We sat at a table for over 15 minutes and no one came to serve us. They looked and walked past, or back to the bar area. I Can see why they say, All you can eat, they don't ever serve you. I will never go back there.
Had to give them one star, or couldn't leave the review. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. They have a great menu for a golf course restaurant. Lots to choose from and have no complaints. The staff is very nice and would like to see more places like it."}
{"text":"The Pineapple Salsa & homemade chips are amazing. The Wings are great & the beer is ice cold too! Perfect place to watch the games on Sundays, EVERY game is on all the TV's!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Josh made two delicious breakfasts. Our waitress Lisa was very pleasant.

I ordered the vegetable omelet with bacon, and my friend ordered the Mulligan special and we both loved our breakfast. The potatoes  had a delicious flavor. The Executive Chef's name is Jay.

We're going to start coming back here regularly.

Of course since this is connected to Western skies golf course, it has a beautiful view of the golf course and the lake.

We appreciated the Yelp check in special.

The white cheese and beef on pita chips was delicious."}
{"text":"Always wondered what this place was all about so my family tried it. I was pleasantly surprised by the food and the prices. We came for lunch and both my kids had their kid's meal..one had a Mac n'cheese with the hotdog and the other one was cheese quesadilla with fries. Their portions were huge and my kids are quite picky and they liked the food. My husband just had the hot dog with the home made chips and he also enjoyed it as well. I wasn't that hungry so I just had the small tomato bisque that came with a grilled cheese or something but it was delicious. The prices are very affordable and it was a nice place to hang out. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. We would definitely go back and we are glad that we tried this place out. It's quite a hidden gem:)"}
{"text":"Who would have thought their food would be absolutely amazing!! I cannot wait to get back and try more on the menu!!! 
Let me start off by saying the service was decent nothing stellar, and the food was absolutely terrific. I have never had better mozzarella sticks that had amazing cheese and a light batter. Don't get me started on the dipping sauces because I am just drooling thinking about them. I was kind of bummed when the waitress took them away because I could have definitely used those sauces to dip my French fries in. Not like you really need them with their awesome fries but it would have made it a million times better. 

My boyfriend and his coworker got the burgers and they were MASSIVE. I didn't get to try either but they ranted and raved about them(the par 5 and the pastrami) sounded so delish on the menu.  I myself had ordered the burger wrap which was also pretty good and filling I would have liked no onions in it though not really Big on fresh cut onions. Bleh. The meat could have scattered better I think but oh we'll still pretty damn good and glad I tried it. 

Believe me when I say this is a must try for all!!"}
{"text":"Got to say after a long time of not eating here, I must say the meals have been improved 100%. Still need to pay more attention to the order taking, but good to see you guys back in the game. Keep up the new image"}
{"text":"We love Mulligans. The nachos here are amazing and the flat bread will leave you wanting one all to yourself :). Jay is such an excellent chef and his staff is so wonderful and welcoming. Not a bad thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went there for the fish fry. Very, very good, but can anyone tell me what kind of fish they serve?"}
{"text":"I came here with my mother in law and my kids and we were sooo disappointed. I thought based on the reviews that we were going to find a great new (close!) burger place. Noooope.

We got there early and headed out to the patio since it was a beautiful day. We sat next to another table having drinks and watched the golfers. The people at the next table were super loud and were using really foul language. Let me be clear, I have a potty mouth. I am no saint, but this was bad enough that it was making my kids uncomfortable. Next, they light up cigarettes. On the patio. Not 10 feet from the door that has the no smoking sign it. Pretty sure that's illegal? Anyway, we got up and moved all the way over to the edge of the patio. Problem solved, or so I thought. As the patio filled up with diners, more and more people started lighting up. The restaurant did absolutely nothing. 

As for the food, they don't have a kids menu, so heads up to any parents out there. Their burgers were very meh and the tator tots were no different than what you get at the grocery store. The mac and cheese is of the Kraft variety. My daughter found a hair in her burger. Oh, and everything tasted like an ash tray because of the smoking on the patio. The server was super nice, comped the burger, and did a good job, but it just wasn't enough to make up for the rest.

For the life of me I cannot figure out how this place is so highly rated. I'm guessing it's because of the members of the golf club? Maybe they get perks? Who knows. I definitely will never be back."}
{"text":"The bar is fine, the staff friendly and the beer was acceptable.  The riff raff band was good.  What was not acceptable is the despicable patrons, 2 couples who showed up in Black Face.  Seemingly everyone in the bar thought it was funny.  The bar reserves the right to refuse service to anyone but apparently the management agrees that racism is acceptable. I guess this is what I should have expected in a neighborhood filled with the Grand Wizard Trump signs adorning so many lawns."}
{"text":"Can't review the golf course and forget the restaurant staff!  These people know what they are doing, friendly smiling staff, great food and the Manager seems to know everyone by name.  Ariel has been a staple here forever and makes everyone feel at home.  If this isn't your new favorite spot after the first visit you are doing it wrong."}
{"text":"Ordered a Buffalo Chicken Wrap. Nice sized sandwich, and very tasty. They have a nice sized patio too. It was a little noisy inside, I had a problem hearing someone sitting across the table from me at times. Great service in the restaurant and the pro shop! Can't wait to try their breakfast and dinner menus, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting from a golf clubhouse. 
The entire restaurant was a mess. No one came to greet us so we sat ourselves, the waitress saw us and walked past us. We ended up just leaving."}
{"text":"Great food and service - loved the hamburgers and Mac and cheese. Very fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Great place to eat !! Lisa was a doll, and the Egg Salad BLT, a creation of Dean was AWESOME !!! Colleen's burger was huge and delish !!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. We had the green chili pulled pork nachos to share with four of us. Huge plate, Medium heat and delicious. My very picky friend who comes from Texas and has spent a lifetime in authentic Mexican restaurants said these were some of the best nachos he's had in years. All the food was very good. My sister had the egg salad sandwich. It looked good but she said it lacked flavor. Two of us had the green chili Mac and cheese ( yummy and slightly spicy) and the other lady in our party had the fish tacos which she said were very good. 
The restaurant is a typical sports bar kind of place and there were several there to watch the Sunday football games. 
Very reasonable prices and our waitress was very attentive. I couldn't find the menu online so I am putting it on the pictures portion of the review here. 
I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went their for breakfast last Sunday.  Wow what a surprise, who would have thought a golf course would have such good food!  I had the green chili pork skillet, it had such great flavor.  My wife had a healthy breakfast sandwich on rye.  It too was very tasty.  Great service, not very crowded, except for some golfers coming in after their round, and decent pricing.

My only complaint was the pork was a little runny, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.  The great taste, however, was the determining factor for us whether we will return.  We definitely intend to back for round two!"}
{"text":"Service staff is super friendly and food is always great. Love the Bloody Mary bar on Sundays. One suggestion is to carry an IPA on draft."}
{"text":"This place was awful. The restaurant was empty at 10:30 am on a Sunday. That should've been the first indication that it wasn't going to be a good experience, as all breakfast spots are packed on Sundays. Anyway, there was nobody to greet you as you walk in, so we seated ourselves. There was clutter about the restaurant and the storage room door was open with storage flowing out into the restaurant. We read the menu and still waited a long time for a server to acknowledge us. Even though there was only one other 2 top table in the whole place. She finally came over and took our order. I had to send the iced tea back because it tasted terrible. I asked if it was made fresh and she told me it came from a box!??? I spent $12 on a 2 egg veggie omelette and she charged me an additional $2 to substitute fruit for potatoes!!!! It wasn't even a dish of fruit, but one of those little metal cups that they serve a side of dressing in, so maybe 4 pieces of melon. 2 grapes. And a half of a strawberry. $14 breakfast with no meat, no potatoes, and no toast! Insane! Will never go back."}
{"text":"It's time for me to update my review.  I love the fact that I can walk to Mulligan's.  The staff has changed and the food has changed for the worst.  They have declined hamburgers.  The hamburgers have been replaced with some sort of burger filler.  I remember having a delicious thick grilled beef burger.  So disappointed in the menu.  Making cheaper dishes will result in loss of customers in the end.  It's sad because there are so many restaurants in this area no one is going to want a 1/4 inch soybean filler burger.  Please please change you food source or get rid of the chief.  What ever happened to the great food? Maybe it's time to say goodbye to Mulligans.  Last night we attended to Night Golf event.  It's was such a great time but the bbq dinner was horrible.  The hamburgers were so discussing and the sausages were like rubber.  The so called chili came out of a can..gross.  I would have not expected for what we paid for.  There was nothing BBQ on that buffet.  I was really disappointed with dinner.  If you don't do something about the quality of food you are going to loose customers.  Need to step up your game with customer service as well.  You have that beautiful grill outside...use it.  I would suggest that next bbq pulled pork, coleslaw, your famous homemade chips, grilled chicken and salad.  That doesn't cost much and it makes for a lovely bbq menu."}
{"text":"We just had our wedding rehearsal brunch on Saturday at Mulligans. The food was amazing, Jay is a very talented chef and very friendly. Laura, the events manager, was very nice and very helpful thru out the planning. We had a great time and everyone loved the food. Would recommend Mulligans to anyone!"}
