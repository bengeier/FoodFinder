{"text":"I've never had such quick service in my life!!!! The restaurant is always busy and I was pleasantly surprised by how fast we got our food, from arriving to ordering, I'd say 7 minutes. Now that's fast especially in Calgary! 

Spring rolls were fresh and hot, beef pho was spicy (love spicy). I ordered the regular and the portion size was enough for two people! Condiments on the table were clean, sometimes at Vietnamese restaurants they tend to overlook making the sauces on the table presentable.

When you go up to the counter to pay, the waitress had no problem splitting the bill and she even offered to split the cost of the appetizer for us. I have no problem giving a super great tip when restaurants are all about giving above and beyond service. Food is cheap as borscht, but quality is fantastic!!! I'd be back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"A staple for pho in calgary, always reliable, open late, typical service...perfect go to for an awesome meal. Get the deep fried wontons added to your pho :)"}
{"text":"Couldnt tell what was worse, the food or the servers attitude. The spring rolls at the beginning of the meal were great. Although i did have to get up and get my side plates myself. I had the shrimp and chicken vermicelli dish, the chicken and the shrimp were both very dry and hard to chew, almost like it was very over cooked. I ended up spitting it out because i didnt want to take a chance with the seafood. I was waiting to tell the server but she never came over, so i took my meal up to her and said what was wrong with it and that i didnt want it. The server immediately raised her voice at me for the entire restaurant to hear, telling me im wrong and that no one complains at her restaurant. I told her i didnt want an argument, i just wanted to return my food. She then took my food back and told me that i had to pay for it even though i didnt eat any of it. Dont ever eat here, its all around a terrible place."}
{"text":"Ordered the sate chicken noodle soup, nice blend of spices, perfect ratio of noodles to soup. Perfect for take out."}
{"text":"I tried out Co Do for the first time this weekend.  As a vegetarian, I was happy to see that their menu had a special vegetarian section.  I was also happy to see that their website reminds vegetarian visitors that the \"vegetarian\" pho is made with a pork-based stock.  I appreciate those little reminders!

We arrived around noon for lunch, and there were a few other people seated in the restaurant.  Over the course of our meal more groups came and went, but the restaurant never filled.  The walls are painted a warm red and there are traditional images of Vietnam around the restaurant... the atmosphere is definitely nice for an inexpensive restaurant like Co Do!

My friend and I started with the vegetarian spring rolls, which were great.  I then had Banh Xeo Chay, which was supposed to be a crepe topped with mixed vegetables, tofu and bean sprouts.  I had actually seen some pictures of this dish before and I was excited to try it firsthand.  What I was served ended up being nothing like what I'd seen online- but it was still really good.  The yellow crepe was filled with just-steamed cauliflower, broccoli and carrots, as well as fried tofu.  Bean sprouts were nowhere to be found.  The crepe itself was good, and the filling was nice as well (especially when dipped into what I now realize was totally un-vegetarian fish sauce!)... but there just something not-quite-right about big pieces of crunchy vegetables in a soft crepe.

I would definitely go back to Co Do, and I might even order the same dish (now that I know what to expect).  However, with lots of vegetarian choices I might also try something new!"}
{"text":"BE WARNED - look at your food before you eat it! We ordered take out and asked several times, very clearly and had it confirmed that there was a fatal peanut allergy. 
We looked over the food very quickly and once we got home opened for a closer look, BOTH DISHES CONTAINED PEANUT GARNISH. And not just a little. 
I am incredibly thankful that I opened the boxes first and tried the chopped up bits. 
Hate to leave a bad review, but this could have killed my boyfriend. 
On top of all that, now we're both starving. 
Be careful if you have any food allergies!!!! :("}
{"text":"Take it from me, I am Vietnamese and I live in Southern California (Vietnamese central in the US), this is by far the best Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to! EVER!!!  I love this place.  Whenever I come to Calgary, this is my first stop!  I've tried just about everything on their menu so I have too many favorites.  Oh what I would do for Co Do's Pho Satay right now!!!

Anyways, here is the breakdown:
FOOD: ALWAYS AMAZING!!!!!!!
DRINKS: Same as other places.  Just the norm.
SERVICE: Quick.  Owners are very quiet, humble people.
PARKING: requires patience sometimes
AMBIANCE: I like it!
CLEANLINESS: much cleaner and sanitary than other Vietnamese restaurants


LOVEEEE THIS PLACE!! I wish they would expand to California!!  You all must give it a try!! It shan't disappoint!!! :) Go on, delight your taste buds!"}
{"text":"A traditional and long standing Vietnamese diner on 17th Ave SW. Fast service, affordable. Best in town for value and flavour. I always order beef satay pho and tea. It's what you want it to be. Saigon. Solid."}
{"text":"I used to live on 15th Avenue and 11th, and when I was in a pinch for good, fast food that wasn't that Rockadoodle McDonalds on 17th, I went to Co Do. I remember it being this cute, locally owned place that had great food at a decent price.

Enter a few weeks ago, while re-living my bygone days, I decided to revisit Co Do.

Apparently my memory is fading because Co Do has gone downhill. The rave reviews here are of a restaurant I remember, not a restaurant that currently is. 

Co Do needs cleaning. Badly. The walls are splattered with mysterious sauce remnants (?) the windows are clouded with grease and I won't even mention the bathroom...I'd hate to see the kitchen.

The food has also gone down in quality. The rice was overcooked, the tofu I got was mushy and the sauce bland, all served on too little vegetables. One used to get a great bargain, lots of food, and lots of flavor; but now, it sort of made me wrinkle my nose.

If Co Do pulls up its socks it could once again be the good little place on the corner I remember; but for now, it needs a wash and a rethink.

T."}
{"text":"I find it hard to reconcile all the great reviews with the actual restaurant I visited last weekend. Snow's review matched my experience the best. The place was near empty during the lunch hour - always a bad sign. The vegetarian menu looked bland, my spring rolls on vermicelli tasted bland, the place was dirty (walls & floor), and the staff inattentive (dude didn't even try to upsell me on anything, not even a drink)."}
{"text":"Codo will always hold a special place in my heart. Mostly because it was my first experience with Vietnamese ever.  Codo's food is so good that I've compared every single restaurant to it ever since.  I don't know if that is a good thing or not because I've become so accustomed to perfectly flavoured rice vermicelli, pork and spring rolls.  My mouth is watering as I type. Sorry keyboard, it is just too good.

My tip for Codo's would be definitely don't be disappointed if you don't get a table.  It always busy, so you if you are able to snag a seat, you might as well buy a lotto ticket, you are that lucky. 

Their take-out is just as good as eating in and it will give you a chance to sit on a curb behind 17th ave and have a great dinner.....sorry, I'm reminiscing. 

If you haven't experienced vietnamese yet then you should definitely start and end at Codo's.  You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I've got to be honest, Most Vietnamese places Ive gone to ( Dozens) have never let me down...except one. They also tend to offer almost identical tastes.Vietnamese as far as tastiness, healthiness and affordability is always your best bang for buck ratio. 
CoDo is just deadly, close to my house and quick friendly service.
Dont sit by the door in -30...but that goes for any door in the city, just a tidbit of advice."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite place but now have gone down hill .. The chicken and beef are tiny pieces and very dry , veggies are not fresh at all ..  .. The portions are average for the price .. The only thing left good here is the very flavourful broth .. They make amazing soup broth just are really lacking in what is out in it . Finding a lot of other places better for cheaper ! ( side note .. Bathrooms are so gross )"}
{"text":"This was the place where I first learned what Pho was. It was an excellent intro.

We arrived about an hour before closing (something I don't like doing), but the staff were quite friendly and happy to serve us. I got a Beef Pho...but somewhere in there I didn't get any sort of spring rolls to start. I downed the pho and was full for the moment...but an hour or so later I was hungry again.

I'll definitely be back for another variety of pho, and to get some spring rolls."}
{"text":"My new all-time favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary.

I was in serious withdrawal of GOOD pho and I finally found it here!

TGFP (Thank God For Pho!)

If you've never been, definitely stop by! Great food, insanely reasonable prices, wonderful service."}
{"text":"The Pho at this place was off putting from a traditional recipe, but was still mediocrely done. 
The stir fried beef noodles on the other hand were almost uneatable. The beef and shrimp had an unpleasant scent to it, that provoked gag reflexes. Also, the noodles were nor stir-fried nor cooked. 
Last time ordering from this restaurant, too much room for improvement that need to be fulfilled. This place has a lot of catching up to do, in order to be relevant beside their competitors."}
{"text":"The service was prompt. I walked in the door and I was led to a table immediately. The food came almost instantly after ordering. Great food, great service."}
{"text":"When it's cold outside and something hot in temperature and hot in spice is needed to make you feel better this place is great! I love their Satay soup and homemade lemonade (its actually lime) so good when you want to ward off the cold!"}
{"text":"It's ok.  This city is full of Vietnamese restaurants and I don't get what stands out about this one to the other reviewers.  It seems average.  Maybe because I order the vermicelli and spring roll dishes instead of pho?"}
{"text":"Perhaps it is because I went on a Sunday late afternoon, but this place was nowhere near as impressive as I was expecting.  I ordered the beef noodle soup and it was good, but not spectacular. The basil was pretty wilted, there wasn't much meat in the soup and the tendons were quite chewy. All this was balanced out by broth that was quite good making a 1.5 star dish into a three and a half star dish. I also had the mango shake and some beef satay, both of which were average.

The restaurant itself was nicer than other vietnamese restaurants I have been in and everything was clean."}
{"text":"I love this place- always, always good food and cheap!  My go-to for vietnamese in Calgary!"}
{"text":"If you order takeout here, be careful to confirm the price before you hang up. Otherwise, you'll end up with a surprise on your bill.
The food is pretty much what you'd expect from any of the many casual Vietnamese restaurants around town. It's not high end by any means, but more just something you grab when you don't want to cook."}
{"text":"The beef noodle soup is fantastic!  Beef noodle is my favorite food, I search out new places every chance I get.  This place was on my radar for awhile due to other reviews, so finally got the chance to go.
Food - as stated above, the broth for the soup is unbelievable.  There is no grease / oil slick on top at all, the flavor is light, but just right to complement whatever you want to throw in.  Spring rolls were above-average as well, crispy and well made.
Service - very friendly, efficient and fast.  They asked about the weather, no snow yet, but sure felt like it's on the way.
Parking - 17th Ave parking, also side street parking.
Overall - clean place, we actually smelled the ammonia as we walked in so it was freshly scrubbed.  Good experience, will be returning.  We didn't have alcohol, but it looked like there was a well-stocked bar at the back."}
{"text":"This would have been a 4-star if I had never been introduced to Basil or Pho Dau Bo.
Don't get me wrong, there's nothing truly amiss with the place. The service was reasonable. The Pho was quite serviceable. There's nothing bad here. My dining partner was quite impressed with her bubble tea as well. 
However, after trying those other places, I just can't in good conscience give it a 5. 
There is one bonus to Co Do though: It is open until 10pm. This is an edge on both Basil and Pho Dau Bo."}
{"text":"Another staple for me in Calgary. I've tried many pho places here as there are so many, but Co Do has the best bang for your buck. Tasty pho that isn't overly oily, and I usually add extra beef for an additional $3. For my bf and I to eat two bowls of pho with extra beef it's $26. There were times we came here multiple times in a week especially when it was -20 outside. 

The owners have memorized our order by now and they're always pleasant whenever we come in. Love Co Do!"}
{"text":"Me and my daughter go here regularly, usually Sunday's. We can never finish as they give healthy portions.  We love the avocado milk shakes. The price is more than reasonable and I always leave feeling we got our money's worth. The service is fantastic and they are always so sweet to us. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Friendly little place.  Really good value and the food is great.  The staff are very friendly and the service is prompt and consistent."}
{"text":"For Vietnamese, this is the best I've had in Calgary. It's a tiny, basic little joint along a busy street with very limited parking, but the food is worth the hassle to get there!

The menu has all your typical Vietnamese items, and they make it right. Service is friendly and fast. I've been here about 15 times for dine in and countless times for take out. You can't go wrong here!

And if you haven't tried Vietnamese Coffee yet, you'd better do that!

Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I love this place, always tastes great, great price. Good portions nice and clean. Recommend.

One of the best of my favorite places there always fast and friends and there is usually lots of space."}
{"text":"It's places like these that I sorely miss ever since I left Toronto. It's low-key and cheap but not dirty, with the dining room filled with your typical Viet pho house decor.

 The place was uncharacteristically slammed for a Monday, with a fair amount of take out/skip the dishes being done. Probably because of the Flames' playoff game. The lady running the front was very nice and diligent, despite the overwhelming amount of orders coming in.

I had the typical pho tai, which has a variety of meaty toppings. A medium will set you back 8.50 and is a pretty satisfying portion. The pho broth was piping hot, with your typical flavour profile of rich beef and asian spices; namely star anise. The rare beef was a tad overdone, but the brisket was quite tender. The tripe had good chew and the tendon was SUPER soft. The rice noodles are thinly cut (I prefer thicker) and was a very decent portion. 

The spring rolls are the typical meat-filled ones you'll find anywhere, but they were still pretty solid. I finished the meal with a Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. Order it halfway through your meal to give it time to brew, as it is done pour-over style. If you love VERY strong coffee, you'll love Vietnamese coffee.

All in all, very good experience here."}
{"text":"Had a good visit here - I had the lemongrass chicken on rice (#40) and it was delicious. I haven't tried out a whole host of Vietnamese restaurants so I'm no expert, but definitely worthy of having again.

Despite arriving less than an hour before close, the staff were very friendly. However, they seemed to keep us waiting forever towards the end of the meal while we wanted to pay & leave.

I'd definitely drop by again.

(9/30)"}
{"text":"In my opinion the perfect hang over cure is a big spicy bowl of pho. So after waking up with a headache this Sunday, my wife and I decided to try this establishment. 

We were greeted by the host and immediately sitted. I ordered the large pho (8.5$) and my wife got the medium(7.5$) with everything in it. I specifically looked for tendon and tripe my two favorite ingredients in the pho. 

The soups arrived very fast. As usual I added a lot of hot sauce and basil. The soup was very tasty and maybe in my Canada top 10. 

I will definitely go back there to try other items on the menu. The spring rolls and BBQ pork looked very delicious. The prices are very affordable and the location is excellent. 

Don't be intimated by relatively shady exterior. Next time you are on 17th Ave and craving Vietnamese food, give them a chance."}
{"text":"jumpin' bean sprouts that was good soup!

I know, saying Co Do makes good sate is like saying water is wet, but this was honestly the first time I had tried the place, despite having lived in the area for 5+ years. Don't ask me how it stayed off my radar for so long, I can only blame a tear in the fabric of space and time....  And to be honest, I only went because I wanted hot/spicy soup after 9pm and Golden Bell was closed... Kinda glad they closed shop early because now I know what everyone else knows :)

Beef sate was on the milder side- for sate that is. Gentle heat and fantastic broth! I would order it extra spicy next time. Not the peanutty kind of broth (like golden bell) but rich and complex, and just plain good.

Definitely worth a try! All the best Vietnamese places seem to be little holes in the wall, and this place is no exception, small, cozy but fresh and yummy! I will definitely be back.

**pro tip- if you are getting take out, you can totally score free parking in the alley at the scotia bank spots. Just be quick and don't blame me if you get a ticket :P"}
{"text":"Given the high ratings, I actually had better but for the value, location (not much around here in terms of Viet) and cleanliness, this is an easy one to recommend.

Ordered the grilled pork on vermicelli, and as pic shows, this is an insane amount of meat!  Enough for 2 ppl for sure.  Noodles, i'm a bit of a snob: not as long and consistent, some short batches here and there.  

but good tasting fish oil sauce, and finely-cut veggies.

credit cards ok.

p.s. And isn't it so refreshing that it doesn't have a boring name such as Hong, Hang, or Phuong?"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Calgary I asked a friend who knew the hottest spots where the best pho was and he said hands down the Co Do in Calgary.  And with that request he actually took me there.

It was some week night and we had to actually wait in line because the place was super packed.  There were many Asians in the place but it was also brimming with Non Asians, families, artists, and couples.  My friend whispered to me that the secret had leaked out.

We sat at a table for two in the back and because the place was crowded, you really had to squeeze into your table.  The service was very fast and before I knew it I had a huge steaming Pho in front of my face moistening my pores.  It was delicious and so fresh, we had been sitting for at least an hour and the line up was nonstop.

They did encourage us to leave by placing the bill on our table as soon as we asked for it, but that was fine.  Can't think of delaying someone else from the delicious food here.

Prices are cheap, service excellent and the best Pho in the City of Calgary."}
{"text":"Order the right dishes, Co Do is pretty stellar.
Order the wrong dishes, Co Do is simply average.

There are few great things going for this place. First, it is open late (11pm).  Second, it is super convenient.  Third, the beers are very cheap aka great spot to start off your night before you start bar hopping along 17th. 

The first time we were here, we ordered the non-typical dishes on the menu, ie. Bun Bo Hue and the Pho Ga (chicken). Stay away. These dishes were sub-par and wouldn't order them ever again. 

The second time around, however, Co Do redeemed themselves. This time, we ordered our lesson and ordered the usual pho. The broth was delicious and it really hit the spot.  

Oh and did I mention that they are open late?"}
{"text":"I used to love Co Do- in fact, it's the first Viet resto I ever ate at in Calgary (May 2000). Over the years and with many apparent changes in ownership, it's gone downhill. The size of servings has shrunk and I have to sadly say that I am boycotting them now and forever because I ordered fried rice there (based on the good luck I've had with fried rice at other viet places, like Thanh Long up the street) and it was perhaps the single worst dish I have ever paid for. Taste-free mush- I got it to go and chucked it in the garbage in my kitchen. It was as if they hadn't even tried- just horrible food.

I am giving them one star because they need a kick in the pants and in the hope that people will start to discover the outrageously better Pho Ngon a half-block to the west. Even the new Thai Tai, next to Priape and across the street from Co Do, is better.

If you keep patronising them and giving unearned glowing reviews, they'll never improve, and this place needs tonnes of improvement."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place gets 4/5 stars. The satay pho broth was about as tasty as dishwater. I'm not sure if they just had an \"off\" day but with the great reviews it gets I'm hoping so. Grumpy server as well. Yikes"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here for dinner on Friday night because we didn't feel like cooking, I'd seen a good amount of poor reviews but decided to give it a chance anyways. 

We both had pho, I had beef and my boyfriend had a spicy chicken one, both were bland. The chicken one had a weird almost a fishy taste to it. And not in a good way. After dousing my beef pho with hoisin and sriracha, it wasn't bad, but the broth in both soups was just so bland and not good. 

We started with spring rolls, which were good, and the food came fast, but the service wasn't good, no one asked us how our food was after it came. Wouldn't go back here."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good location. Not the BEST pho I've ever had but definitely gets the job done."}
{"text":"This Pho is very decent. The broth is very flavorful and the sizes come in a very satisfying portion. I always ask for extra lime and basil to add more flavor. Also they have this special hot peppers paste that adds a bit of spiciness to your pho. Overall, really good taste at a very decent price!"}
{"text":"Vietnamese soup, hard to screw up, but because of the almost insatiable demand, hard to find a decent, reasonably-priced place in this city that serves it.

Everything on Co Do's menu is under $9, with the option of getting large or medium servings. The medium servings go from around $7.50, and are easily large enough to fill me up. The service is just quick, as it should be.

As many have said below, Co Do is now how I define Vietnamese food in this city."}
{"text":"I love their food. Hole in the place. But their food is delicious and cheap. Dinner for two with two appies and two entrees with a drink each under $45! Service is shit when the guy is serving but I don't really care about that as I go to this place often enough that I don't mind going up and grabbing my own fork from behind the counter lol."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Pho the other night so thought I'd check out Co Do.  Started with the spring rolls and the grilled beef pho for a main.  The spring rolls were quite tasty.  Good size and freshly fried.  The Pho was very good with a healthy portion of beef.  Well prepared and very fresh.

What would have made the spring rolls perfect is if they were served with lettuce and fresh mint.  I used to go to an AMAZING Vietnamese restaurant in Edmonton (Mekong on 107th Ave) that served the best spring rolls.  You could wrap them with fresh lettuce and mint leaves at the table.  Oh so tasty!!!  I've tried a lot of Vietnamese places in Calgary but have yet to come across anyone who serves their spring rolls like this."}
{"text":"I LOVE Vietnamese food.  I'm contemplating a trip to Vietnam so that I can eat exclusively Vietnamese food for many weeks.  

I did not love Co Do.  Perhaps Co Do is short for COuld be DOing better.

Yeah, it's reasonably priced.  
Yeah, you can get a glass of wine for $5.
Yeah, it's ok.

But, it's not that clean (which is kind of a big deal for me in food service establishments).
The food is pretty average.
The service is pretty average.

Bottom line - iIn this city there are many many Vietnamese options, so I'm not going to settle for \"pretty average\".  You shouldn't either."}
{"text":"I used to go here years ago but have stopped.  I recently stopped in for a pick-up and realized how much it's gone downhill.  The service used to be prompt and friendly, now you have a man that has a permanent scowl running the place.  The restaurant is dirty and doesn't smell too great.  The food was so-so.  There are so many more choices for Vietnamese food and if you're not willing to stand out from the rest or even just ensure your place is clean then why bother?"}
{"text":"Review #16 for Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012

I grabbed takeout from here the other night because it was after 9pm and my local Vietnamese place was closed. 

I got a 47 B stir fried tofu and vegetables on rice vermicelli noodles.  I appreciate they have some vegetarian options on their menu, but it's basically all the same, plain veggies and tofu or curried veggies and tofu on rice or noodles. 

My order was ready when I picked it up, so I was in and out really fast. 

I like that they're open late and might grab take out again if I'm in a pinch and looking for something quick. 

You can check out their menu online here: http://findmenus.ca/codoVietnamese.php"}
{"text":"Cleanest vietnamese restaurant i've been to in Calgary. Good value (Lot of delicious food for your money!) Polite & quick service. 
After trying many pho restaurants, this is my new favourite!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a pho addict. If I could eat it everyday I would. I am from overseas and where I'm from you can get cheap Pho pretty easily. I have also eaten it in Vietnam and fell in love with it there. Unfortunately since moving to the USA I have yet to find a great Pho and was pleasantly surprised when I came to Co Do for a warm Pho on a cold day. I honestly picked it because it was the closest place to where I was staying during a quick trip to Calgary. I can say hands down it the best Pho I've had so far in my time in North America. 

Got the original rare beef Pho and it was exactly the right flavours. It wasn't a big as some of the bowls I've become accustomed to but its a good size to still fill you up without making you feel overly uncomfortably full. Only down side was they did not provide any fresh chillies on the side with the spouts, lemon etc so I had to ask, but not a big problem. 

Service was very good (better than the usual places I go and I actually normally find that the worse the service the better the  food in these places so props to these guys for giving you both!). Also in terms of cleanliness (which others have said wasn't up to scratch) I would have to disagree with those people. The décor is really nice much more than your usual cheap viet place and it was clean and I didn't feel the need to wipe my chopsticks with a serviette which I often feel I need to do at other pho places.

If you are nearby, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love Co Do. The food is always very good, swift service and you can get booze here.

It might be that it is just a short jaunt down the hill for me, but we keep coming back for the spicy chicken sate pho. Their noodle bowls are great too.

The only thing they are missing is they do not do Vietnamese subs. If they did that I would never eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"Coming from San Francisco, Bay Area, I must say that we have the best vietnamese joint in this side of the globe. Just visited Calgary. Our first day there and just got out of the airport, starving to death. Found Co Do w/ great reviews here so I thought this must be darn good. 
I thought the place was ok, but could use some cleaning for sure. I can see sauce markings on the wall. Condiments on the tables needed to be refilled.
We ordered soup and the spoon handle was sticky, wondering if they are doing a good wash? The menu needs to be replaced, the sides were torn, it looked all chewed up! Plus it smelled like cigarette smoke.
We ordered the noodle soup, fried rice and chicken wings. One star for great customer service, one star for great tasting chicken wings and one star for the good broth. Not impressed with the other ingredients they put in the soup. Just few pieces of brocolli and carrots and tofu, few shredded chicken but that was pretty much it. I'm  used to our Pho soup here in SF where it's got all sorts of things, from mint to fishballs, chicken and shrimp..... there's just more to it.  The fried rice was blah too. I can totally make it myself, it's just fried rice w/ frozen peas and carrots. Quite disappointing. 
All in all, it wan't all that!"}
