{"text":"Two key points:   1. Lunch: cheaper, laid-back 2. French fries with garlic aioli: fatty deliciousness (You must ask for the aioli.)  They have a decent lunch, though I really just go for the french fries. Other lunch food worthwhile: tomato bisque, chicken salad wrap, and grilled cheese. I was never in a burger mood when there, but I see a lot of people ordering it.  Service here often becomes great fodder for conversation afterward. I mean, there was a waitress who was super perky and nodded vigorously whenever I asked for something--to then come back happily each time, completely forgetting that I asked for anything at all. I forced a friend to steal sugar from tables because of her. And another waiter who ran around in a rush as if someone was holding a gun to him and ordering him to drop those checks off, stat."}
{"text":"I never choose this place but end up here a couple times a year because this is where people want to go (for whatever reason). It's always disappointing. After reading some of the reviews I can see it's not just me. Two repeat offenses. (1) reservations that are meaningless because they either overseat or over-reserve, and (2) mediocre food & service. Not worth it. Too bad Kennedy's closed."}
{"text":"Bad service, overpriced food, food is WAY overrated"}
{"text":"Never gone wrong here with the lobster tempura appetizer, filet mignon, & creme brulee! They change up their menu seasonally which is fun. My boyfriend & I prefer it over going into downtown Champaign now. Easier parking, quieter atmosphere, & better service in our experience."}
{"text":"Higher end restaurant. You should probably dress up. Pre-nights are held here.  I'd only recommend going here only for happy hour appetizer specials and drinks  Off-campus in Urbana."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a special occasion. The steaks are amazing and the service is very friendly and kind. The desserts are rich and satisfying. In all, while more expensive than your average Urbana restaurant, it is worth every penny. I highly recommend Silvercreek to anyone looking for a wonderful meal and a wonderful night out."}
{"text":"I have had a couple so-so experiences here, one bad experience, and one horrible experience. After the last one I decided never to try again. Bad service, terrible (and expensive) food, awful ambiance. Last time the highlights featured an absent host so we stood around aimlessly waiting to be seated, even though it was basically empty. It was August and it felt like the A/C was broken in there, I had to use a menu as a fan. Service was slow and rude (we waited about 10 minutes just to get a beer menu, which we had to make a special request for). Music was terrible and so loud I couldn't tune it out (bad slow jams and classic 70s tunes). My so-called  \"Roasted red pepper risotto\" had not red pepper, but contained raw green pepper. And a fly died in my husband's beer. Yeah, like I said: Never again. There are much better places to eat within just a few blocks, for way cheaper."}
{"text":"Just hosted my daughters bridal shower at Silvercreek. I would highly recommend it. Most of the planning was done via telephone as I'm from out of town but I couldn't be happier with the end result! The food  and desserts were everything I expected and more! The waitstaff was super helpful and courteous...they were wonderful! Thanks Silvercreek for a wonderful bridal shower! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Traditional American food: burgers, sandwiches... pretty much the same as they are at Courier Cafe, its sister restaurant nearby. Had lunch there, not much choices. Foods were just so-so. Environment was very good! This was a large place with back yard. The decoration was classic. A good place for family gathering!"}
{"text":"We had a great family dining experience here earlier this week - I really love the rennovated old building feel, and the way they weave history into the ambience but still manage to be modern. It's the kind of place that could be romantic enough for a date but casual enough to bring the whole extended family. The food is pub-fare but with some good twists (lobster mac and cheese!). I had the BLT (with avocado and goat cheese). Very delicious. There were also veggie burger options that looked good. Wait staff was friendly and accomodating. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the area. the $20 Sunday Brunch Buffet are totally worth it - and do try the desserts! The dinner is delicious as well. Usually, I don't rave about soups but their tomato basil soup was the best I've ever had! My husband who also doesn't necessarily like soups though it was delicious as well. Silvercreek is worth the price and it is a good idea to make reservatiosn."}
{"text":"The food here is just plain terrible. Quantity is all they aim at while forgoing quality. I actually think this one and great impasta are by far the worst restaurants in town. As an Italian I can tell you this food has nothing what so ever to do with Italian cuisine. If I could I would give them negative stars."}
{"text":"We recently had my daughter's bridal shower in the greenhouse, and guests were delighted with the fare, especially the grilled chicken alfredo and sweet potato fries. Lunch was rounded out with a delicious field greens salad, quesadillas, and a fresh fruit salad. The buffet style option fit our needs, and it was a most pleasant and memorable occasion in a lovely setting!"}
{"text":"Silvercreek has been a great place to go to with my parents as a more upscale night out. That being said, I have had some hit or miss experiences with both the food and the service while I have been there.   Most recently, I had dinner with my family there to celebrate my graduation for the University of Illinois. We had put in a reservation for our party well in advance and paid a substantial deposit. We showed up slightly early for the reservation and still had to wait almost an hour after the designated time. We were repeatedly told that it wouldn't be much longer, but by the time our party got to the table we were starving and pretty tired of being there. While I recognized that graduation is a very hectic time for people, I just did not understand what the point of making a reservation was when we had to wait as long as people who walked in the door.   Once we were seated, the service was a little slow but was much more reasonable. Everyone enjoyed the food, which was flavorful and filling. Our favorite item was some sort of crab hushpuppies that were simply phenomenal. However, on other occasions, I have ordered fish dishes and found them to be somewhat bland.   Overall, this place is a nice place to eat if you're looking for somewhere with a fancy vibe in Urbana. However, I would steer clear of it for important events (parents weekends, graduation, homecoming and other peak times) and check the menu before you go to ensure that the food suits your tastes."}
{"text":"When my family first visited Champaign, I wanted to bring them to a classy, clean, and welcoming restaurant. I found Silvercreek online and brought them for lunch, where we were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful simplicity of the restaurant's interior in contrast to it's quaint and seemingly small outside view.   Since I was visiting during a time period of exploring a vegetarian diet, I ordered a portobello mushroom burger. It was--and still is--the best portobello burger that I have ever had. The rich flavors blended beautifully with a creamy cheese on a perfectly toasted bun. The vegetables were soft yet slightly firm. The carrot soup I chose as a side dish was the best soup I ever tasted, comprised of rich notes of cream and vegetable the combined to create a flawlessly rich consistency. I swore it was one of the best places I had ever eaten.  More recently, I went for dinner and was greeted by a similar environment. It was slightly formal but still welcoming, and the linen napkins and surrounding darkness of a wood-based interior still charmed me. I ordered chicken with a rice pilaf and was blown away by how a rice pilaf could consist of so many textures, so many rich flavors. The chicken, though, was slightly dry, although my dinner partners' choice of lamb was perfectly cooked.   For the high cost and the slightly overdone chicken, a five star doesn't seem quite fitting, but I am eager to visit again to know for certain (best two out of three). After all, higher expectations should be expected for a higher end restaurant. But, questions of four and five star reviews aside, this is a great place to eat, go on a date, or catch up with family and friends. I have recommended it to numerous friends, and they have always returned from dates or family visits with positive remarks."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for Sunday brunch.  The buffet is scrumptious and the desserts and perfectly portioned so you can try a bit of everything.  Ask for a table to the garden room; it's really beautiful.  One downside that I've noticed lately is that the juice portion has gotten smaller, but the price has stayed the same.  Be that as it may, brunch is still a pretty good deal.  I find dinner to be overpriced, hence the 4 star rating.  Keep in mind that during busy weekends (graduation) dinner prices are what you will get as they operate on a fixed menu.  Reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Silvercreek many many times over the years since they opened.  It used to be a reliably wonderful experience.  Unfortunately in the past 5-10 years the quality has just not been there.  The restored mill building is beautiful and if you've never been there it's worth a visit just for the architecture.  But I keep hoping for a better dining experience for the money and being disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is decent, so this one-star review is really about the way that Silvercreek treats its costumers.  We went there on graduation weekend and it was busy, but we were assured that the wait would be only 10 minutes, so we stayed. The wait was not 10 minutes, but more like an hour. Every time we asked for an update we were assured that we would be seated in a few minutes... After we sat down we waited more than an hour to get our food. Mostly what we ordered were salads, so there's no way it should have taken that long.  After about an hour they offered us some chips...The food was decent but expensive, as they upped the prices for their special graduation weekend menu. I probably would not have cared so much about the money, had we not had to wait for so long...for salads.  Yes, I understand that it was graduation weekend, but the host should not have promised seating in 10 minutes, just to keep us from leaving. It was clear that they had more business than they could handle, but just wanted the opportunity to make as much money as possible. By the way, people who had reservations didn't seem to fare much better...and they had to put down a $50 deposit just to reserve a table.  By the way, I went to several other restaurants that weekend with my boyfriend and his parents, including Bread Company, Biaggi's, and Big Grove, which were just as swamped as Silvercreek and received much better service in all of them. Also, they were honest about our wait time."}
{"text":"This is a mixed review. 5 stars, 3 stars and 1 star in one based on my experiences in 2013.  5 STARS: I highly recommend going to the Empty Bowls fundraiser held every spring at Silvercreek. You get soup and bread and get to pick a handmade pottery bowl created by local artists. Proceeds go to the Daily Bread Soup Kitchen.   3 STARS: The soup and bread was so phenomenal that my husband I decided to try Easter brunch at Silvercreek. Not the cheapest buffet, but we thought the food would be excellent based on our experience with soup and bread.  The appetizers and the main course were all good, especially the prime rib. BUT  the desserts offered were way sub-par compared to the quality of the main course and appetizers. With the exception of the vanilla bread pudding, which was very good, and the berry cobbler, which I did not have because it was gone, the assorted desserts seemed like they were NOT made fresh from scratch.   Honestly, these were desserts that would be seen at a church potluck with friends rather than at the type of restaurant Silvercreek projects.  It was very disappointing because I look forward to desserts. I eat less \"real\" food because I want to eat more desserts.  1 STAR: After our brunch experience, I emailed the restaurant telling them our experience and mainly asking if the desserts offered at Easter brunch were representative of the dessert menu at Silvercreek.  I received NO response, so I don't know. Even at Courier Cafe (same owner), I can't bring myself to order dessert (other than milkshakes)."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my boyfriend here recently and their new menu options look delicious! We are, however, only able to eat so much food so I'll review the dishes we did eat. We started with the heirloom tomato salad and it was delicious! The dressing goes so well with the delicious cornbread, arugula and tomatoes all together. I got the Scottish salmon and it was very good with a nice olive tapenade. My boyfriend got the filet and he definitely seemed to enjoy it. We finished the meal with the amazingly delicious butterscotch budino which is like fancy pudding, yum! They also seem to have a very extensive mixed drink and wine menu which we didn't have any of but it looks impressive. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Perhaps if I had eaten any food I could rate the food but this is a rating of service only.   After a short wait to be seated I was given a table and a menu. When five minutes had passed and no one had come to the table not even to bring a water I was starting to wonder where a server was. After another five minutes had passed I was becoming rather annoyed. I decided to wait another two minutes for anyone to come to the table and when no one did I left."}
{"text":"Great friday happy hour specials keep me coming back for more! Good draft beer rotation as well."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with Sunday brunch today.  (Oh and by the way, today was Easter for Orthodox people, so I was hoping for this to be a special occasion.)  While I don't think that $18 a person is too much for a nice brunch every once in awhile, i do expect to get what I pay for.  I don't want to be ignored by the hostess, then treated rudely by both her and the waitress.  Additionally, I expect the food to be restocked.  If you own a restaurant and advertise that brunch is offered until 2:30, the brunch should be stocked until that time.  If you want to stop stocking the brunch at 1:00, the advertise that the brunch ends at 1:00.    The good foods were omelets and waffles, smoked salmon and shrimp; the two things I could get cooked fresh, and the two things that are served best cold.  Everything else was cold, crusty crap.  We were rushed by the waitress who couldn't be bothered to refill our drinks.  Busboys were texting, no one would check us out when it was time to pay.  In fact, the only nice people there were the bartender and the omelet chef.    I liked this place in the past, and if I have another chance to come back, I will...so I guess the have a chance to gain some stars."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I was in town to visit my brother and we went there for dinner.  !  They serve warm bread with the meal, which is always a good start.I had the filet and it was soo good, and we shared a couple desserts for dessert and I would recommend each on - creme brule, bread budding, and a torte.  It was so good we went for their Sunday brunch.  It's $20.95 and worth every penny!  When can you get salmon, prime rib, fresh waffles, red velvet cake for $20!  It also comes with drinks included (I had juice and coffee).  They also have an awesome beer and wine selection - much better than your typical restaurant.  I would seriously recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place. I enjoy the farm-to-table, localvore style a lot. Our experience here was... less than optimal. I dined with my husband, and we had a late reservation. We had tickets to a performance at the Krannert, and wanted to eat dinner afterward. Silvercreek was one of the few places which had their kitchen open past 10, so we decided to check it out. We made a reservation, because we wanted them to know that we were coming. There were still two other tables dining when we got there, but that was it. I should have realized that something was wrong when I saw the totally empty parking lot at 10pm on a Saturday night.  First problem: the place was really bright and the music was awful. Chain-restaurant bad 70s music and lighting. Not what I was expecting for the description of what they were going for or for their prices. Pros: the restored location is really charming, and with better lighting and a less cheap and intrusive soundtrack, the place could be beautiful.  Second problem: the booth was dirty. The whole place was practically empty, they knew we were coming and they didn't bother to make sure that the table was clean?  The menu is a nice one. We opted for the calamari to start, then my husband ordered the lamb and I ordered the duck. We like both medium rare, which is the standard way that both meats should be served.  The food was just such a miss. The calamari was okay, and it would have been fine at Applebee's. For the price, a pile of frozen calamari rings (interspersed with pieces of fries and onion fritters - clean your fryer guys!) served with canned sauces is not the \"best of local, seasonal Illinois\".   The entrees came out fast. I mean really fast. So fast that they were decidedly undercooked. I had already gotten a sense that even though the place was theoretically open for another hour, they were unhappy that we were there. Even though they knew we were coming. And they were open for another hour. Both the lamb and the duck were under rare. The cherry jam that was served accompanying my duck was refrigerator cold.  We probably should have sent the food back, but it was obvious that the kitchen was hostile to the idea that people were bothering them an hour before they were even supposed to be closed, so I was somewhat afraid of what would happen if we did. Flat out: the kitchen shouldn't have sent out grossly undercooked food and the server shouldn't have brought the meat to our table that way. The message \"here's your food, eat and get the hell out so we can go home\" was not exactly subtle.  The food would have been good if it had been cooked properly. The plate presentations were nice and the cherry jam was pretty good - nice warm spices and cherries cooked just soft enough. The jam would have been a great accompaniment to the duck, if it wasn't obviously straight out of the walk-in.  It got worse, though. We had ordered a bottle of wine to share, and the entrees came out so fast that we were only half-way through. I'd noticed an \"artisinal cheese plate\" on the appetizer list. I figured that that would be something we could snack on while we finished our wine. Especially since the raw meat wasn't exactly a palatable meal. It also wasn't something that would take a whole lot of work from the kitchen, so I figured it would be safe. When she walked away from the table, the server yelled back to the kitchen \"Cheese plate coming\" Mel's diner-style. Seriously. The kitchen yelled something back to her about not knowing how to make one.  The cheese plate was $19.00 for the large. What we got was a platter of cheese straight from the deli case at the local supermarket. Boursin, some sort of italian herb cheese, a really cheap Double Glouster, a brie and some bland white cheese. Not one of them were anything that would be close to artisan. Not one of them is \"the best of local, seasonal Illinois\". It was served with a handful of jarred black olives and a heaping scoop of the aforementioned ice-cold cherry jam. It wasn't an awful cheese plate, but it is not what it's advertised as, which is surprising since there are a fair number of artisan cheese producers in the area. For $19, I was expecting more than cold supermarket cheese.  Soon after the cheese came the bill. No offer of desert, which is fine, since by that time we really wanted to get out of there and I could have stopped by the store on the way home and gotten some frozen pie if more stuff out of a box was where I wanted to go with the night.  If you're looking for a nice meal, especially late, go elsewhere. The price they charge here does not match the atmosphere, service, quality or taste. It's more family dining, and it would have been great if the bill hadn't run to almost $200 (that's with wine, tax and tip). For slightly more money there are better places in town that don't make you feel like they hate you for coming in while they are open."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Silvercreek's brunch, but woke up too late Sunday to go, so my friend and I settled on trying their dinner instead.  Despite the weather starting to cool off, we decided to sit outside and enjoy the last traces of summer.  Sunday = 1/2 price wine night (per glass) which was surprising as their wine isn't unreasonably priced to begin with (~ $5-$9), and they have a nice selection to choose from.  We split their goat cheese salad, I ordered their stuffed chicken breast, and my friend got their 5-spiced alaskan halibut (which I tried a bite of).  We both agreed that the chicken was really yummy and juicy, anwhile their halibut was well cooked and moist, I found it a bit tasteless (plus a on the more expensive for what you got).  The ambiance is quite romantic (both inside and out), but you don't need to dress up unless you want (I was just in shorts, a tee, and a fleece), and it's just a nice place for a quiet dinner.  I'm going between 3 and 4 stars here, but I until I try their brunch, I'll have to say 3."}
{"text":"This was my 5th time to Silvercreek for brunch. I have yet to go any other time.   Sunday afternoons are really fun here! Brunch... because mimosas. I mean really, do you need another reason. And they have them!!!   This is a buffet style brunch and they keep it classy. Everything is good! The waffle bar is fun and full of amazing toppings. They have your normal breakfast food and they have a salad bar with smoked salmon and cream cheese.   I love love love that they have turkey sausage links on the hot food bar. I don't eat pork, so this makes me very happy.   There service is great too. We call ahead for seats and they are always happy to help. The manager came by our table and is always friendly.   I love it here. We will be back of course!   The 4 start is because they are a little pricey. It's $20.00 a person, with no drinks. Ouch. But in a way, they do give you a lot.   Try to flourless chocolate cake. I promise you its amazing."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it is impossible to give Silvercreek a good review. There were a lot of bumpy moments during our recent visit. For one, we were sat at a table and immediately felt a little warm. We thought it was maybe because the table was near a window. We were wrong. At the end of the meal, as we sat there sweating profusely, we mentioned to the waitress that we were a little on the hot side, to which she responded, \"Oh yes. Two out of the three AC units are not working.\" Great. Other disappointing moments included ordering the special that was supposed to be a filet and they changed it to NY strip (not a huge deal except you shouldn't substitute a 4oz. filet for a 4 oz. NY strip), getting undercooked salmon that had to be sent back to be put back on the grill, and being overcharged for a bottle of wine. Aside from the salmon, everything tasted pretty good, but the bottom line is that it is sad to dish out over $100 for dinner where you are uncomfortable and so many mistakes are made."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and had a good experience. The landscaping and the atmosphere are great. Very friendly service.   I enjoyed my Italian turkey club, which came with good sweet potato fries. Would return if in the area again."}
{"text":"Silvercreek is one of my favorite places to go when I'm in the mood to be pampered with great service and excellent food.  The restaurant's ambience is just about perfect, with romantic lighting and a beautiful garden room that's just breathtaking (more on that in a minute).  There are some complaints on here about the food, but I think it's delicious.  I haven't had anything here I didn't like.  One of my favorites is a salad, whose name escapes me at the moment, made with field greens, goat cheese, toasted walnuts, dried cherries, and a champagne vinaigrette dressing.  It's simply divine; I could be happy with just that.  However, it just keeps getting better.  I think the chefs are pretty creative, although the menu hasn't changed much in the three years I've lived here.  The desserts are excellent, as is the wine selection.  I've heard that brunch is fabulous, but we've only been for lunch once and dinner a handful of times.  They put on quite a show for New Year's Eve, with a special menu and a generally festive atmosphere.  It was New Year's Eve 2004 that my sweetie and I were sitting in that gorgeous garden room, enjoying a night out on the town, when all of a sudden, a diamond ring was staring me in the face, and my sweetie was down on one knee asking me to marry him.  Now, Silvercreek isn't directly responsible for one of the happiest nights of my life, but they certainly helped make it as perfect as it was, and for that, I thank them."}
{"text":"When I come to UI in 1990 as an undergrad, other than the country clubs and Kennedy's/Rick's: An American Cafe and Timpone's, Silvercreek was really THE place to go.  The space is still lovely.  I thought the food quite good until maybe the late 90's.  Several chefs have come and gone recently (last few years).  I have had lunch/dinner here a few times over the last, say, 6 months, and it has been decent.  Nothing too stellar, but not horrible.  The menu gets tweaked more frequently.  HOWEVER - today I stopped by for brunch at about 12:40, it is scheduled to go until 2:30.  Brunch at the Silvercreek of old was very good - lots of salad and hot items, bustling crowd.  It wasn't too crowded, but I was saddened at the brunch I saw.  VERY limited salad items (though the dressing was good).  Mostly very standard breakfast fare, except that the scrambled eggs were somewhat brown (not from brown eggs, either).  Very few hot items, either - some brisket, the kind you would put on a bun, fried chicken (boring), and some salty, rapidly cooling prime rib and ham.  Desserts were unmemorable as well, including a key lime pie that had so much green food coloring in it that I wondered if one of the ingredients was green food coloring.  The trifle I had and the cheesecake were lackluster.  To top it off, I saw my server three times - once for my inital drink, once to clear plates, and once for the bill (which was wrong, I was charged for 2 buffets!) .  Never asked how things were - breezy and unprofessional.  Come on Silvercreek, there are too many other good brunch choices in town, including Luna and Jim Gould (best brunch in town as far as I am concerned, though I don't think they do other meals well).  I think the owner is too busy with his car collection to oversee his eating establishments.  I have not been very impressed with the Courier lately, either (same owner)."}
{"text":"SilverCreek may have given me one of the better experiences of my food eating career. Here's the thing: I like a burger just as much as the next person. But the burger I had at this place was one of the most fancy-schmancy burgers ever served to me.   But let's start with the service. Every time our waitress spoke, I couldn't help but wonder if she was frustrated from constipation. Her aggressive questioning made me feel uncomfortable, but at the same time she got the job done, so I'm not going to judge. Since we were in a hurry, we decided to skip the appetizers, but the the dinner was fantastic. The burger was cooked to order, and the fries were one of the tastiest things I have ever experienced, and I could easily eat them for the rest of my long life."}
{"text":"Come often for happy hour on Fridays- half off bar bites menu. $4 burgers! I always wished there was a better vegetarian option for happy hour because I always get the hummus and feel envious of friends getting a filling meal for $4. The atmosphere is elegant and classy, and there's also frequently live music!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, food, & service is wonderful. You can't go wrong here. Throw on a tie and head out for a great meal."}
{"text":"I had friends come into town and they heard about Silvercreeks brunch so we decided to go. They had an extensive spread of a buffet that had a waffle station and a prime rib station along with a dessert station. i started off with just one mimosa before the waiter told me that we could get a pitcher. Of course I then ordered a pitcher to split with a friend. Besides the mimosas I didn't really enjoy the food that they had to offer. My group of friends were also the youngest people in the entire restaurant. When the bill came I found out that the mimosa pitchers were $30. I was shocked. My bill came to $50 before a tip. I was pretty shocked to say the least because I didn't leave very impressed. The service was good but I probably won't be returning for brunch. $30-$40 is acceptable but $50 before tip is a little too much for me."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a top-of-class restaurant. Anybody giving less than 5-stars cannot afford the $22 brunch price. These are my ratings of individual foods:  prime rib: 10/10 creamy rice: 9/10 croissant: 10/10 lavender shortbread cookie: 10/10 chocolate chip cookie: 10/10 whipped cream (on cake): homemade in their kitchen horseradish: 10/10 omelets: 10/10 made-to-order includes gouda chees tea: 10/10 loose-leaf (no tea bag) earl grey smoked salmon: 10/10 includes capes, crème, sweet pickles, onions  Notice most of their food items rank 10 out of 10, i.e. perfect. So how is it possible that patrons even think about giving a less than 5-star rating? The only reason I can think of - they cannot afford the price, therefore their expectations are too high. This restaurant has the best food (BY FAR) of any sit-down formal restaurant in the area and for the price, it just makes the place a 5-star place. Oh, and the service is great. What is wrong with patrons these days? Do patrons expect restaurants to buy them a trip to the moon just so patrons will eat their food? My message to all the posters who rated this business less than 5-stars, \"Take a chill pill, stay home and eat the frozen processed food you so crave for $1.99 with a coupon. Leave gourmandize to the rest of us who appreciate it.\""}
{"text":"Went to Urbana for quick Sunday visit with our U of I son.  Thought that taking him out for brunch would be nice and it was!  Even though our son is a senior we have never thought about taking him our for brunch before.  What a shame.  Silvercreek is a great find.  First of all, half price mimosas and bloody Mary's.  Need I say more.  (Though a bit strange that they put a maraschino cherry in the mimosa.)  They have a nice omelette and waffle station that  the men enjoyed.  The buffet is filled with lots of hot options and a small table of cold items.  The hot table included two types of scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, vegetable, two types of potatoes (the sweet potatoes au gratin were outstanding), fried chicken, salmon and a carving station with both ham and prime rib.  I always enjoy a nice piece of prime rib with horseradish cream sauce.  The dessert bar had a nice selection too, including a hot chocolate bread pudding that was absolutely decadent."}
{"text":"In and out in 45 minutes for lunch today!! That was awesome.    I ordered the cream of mushroom soup and the 4 oz. filet.  The soup was very good.  The filet came with grilled asparagus and golden potatoes.  I asked for medium rare but received rare (which is better than well done).  It comes with seasoned butter on top which I presumed would be melted but it actually comes out cold.  Nonetheless everything was really good.  Yes, I would recommend Silvercreek for lunch.  They have very affordable items on the lunch menu and in and out time was remarkable!  I will definetly go back."}
{"text":"If this place were in a bigger, more diverse town with more options, it would merit just three stars. Given that it is the only one of a few finer dining options in the CU area, I give it a 4. Our family outing was pleasant, but the meal was not memorable. Will likely eat here again, but will avoid any time there is a graduation, homecoming, or other big university event that pulls in alums and family based on other reviews. Staff who works here seem very nice and fairly accommodating."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and I was very impressed. I loved the atmosphere, and the food was very good. Everyone who took care of me was very attentive and knowledgeable.  The bread that came with the meal was very tasty. I started off with the Roasted Squash Panzaella which is a crouton salad, and it was very good. There were too many croutons in it for me, but I just picked out some of them and ate the rest. For the entree, I got the Crispy Potato Crusted Michigan Whitefish. It was so good. I loved every bite. By the time I got to the end,  I was glad that I had not eaten all of the croutons in the appetizer.  For dessert, I got the Apple Dumpling A La Mode and again it was amazing. It was on the small side, but I thought it was the perfect size for me. Someone else may be disappointed that it wasn't bigger but any bigger and I would not have been able to eat it all.  All in all, I was very happy with my experience and if I am ever in town again, I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Where to start... OK I always thought that Silvercreek was a good place to go if you were A) Old, B) White, and C) middle-class and want to feel good  about your middle-classness. Which is why I never went, because I A) Feel old, B) am really white and C am horribly middle class. I don't like to go places where I all I see is clones of myself, but we went to Silvercreek for the first time 10 days ago, and have already been back another time since! First things first, the decor will suit anyone's parents, but isn't so stuffy and lame that you want to rip the crocheted crap off the walls and scream. The service is good, although knowledge of the wine list could be better (from both servers so far). The menu is really interesting, with a lot of options, and some cool creative twists on some meals which would otherwise be your typical American bistro fare. Prices are worth it, HUGE portions (generally speaking-but the pork chop especially is Massive and the Hangar steak notsomuch). I fully intend on going back, frequently."}
{"text":"I love the setting but the menu is limited and pricey. Staff is usually very good. I had to send my food back as it wasn't heated thru."}
{"text":"I took my family here today for Easter brunch, and was very disappointed by the turn around of the buffet. They were 30-40 mins late getting stuff refilled and turned over. Will reconsider coming back for the brunch. We were seated in the bar area by the kitchen, loud."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices. The architecture and history of the building is interesting and adds to a pleasing atmosphere and experience. A great place for a special date or celebration with family and friends."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch was good and very busy. We made appt, and still had to wait 30 min. The set-up is not convenient and I don't see how they get by with not having sneeze guards, as people constantly walk by the food. Our waitress was good, but not a very happy person, and not very informative. For example the syrup for the french toast was in the bar rather then next to it on the buffet line. So I ate it plain, but it was good. The prime rib was fatty, but delicious. The desserts were plentiful and pretty good, just a little too much on the lemon side. I certainly think it could be a little less pricey $20+, but any prime rib meal is going to be almost as much on its own. Not too excited about returning, but most likely will give it a shot again someday."}
{"text":"Was there with my mom for brunch today... I had to stop and say something to the general manager before leavening.   We began to share with the manager that we always have good service while dining there, but today by far was exceptional!  The wait staff was extremely attentive and was always making sure we had any and everything we needed!!!!  We had mentioned that we had horrible service at another local restive on yesterday and wondered if good customer service still existed...... well it does!!! Waitstaff Aidan and Georgia were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, thank you very much for doing what you do!!!!"}
{"text":"We came into town for a Fruition show at the Canopy Club, rented an Airbnb, the Airbnb host recommended we go here since it was right around the corner. Omg the food is to die for!!! We even met the owner and complimented her, ordering extra food to go. Perfect for lunch or dinner. Not sure if they serve brunch as well? We went for lunch and I had a turkey Brie melt with caramelized onions and apples with Dijon mustard and salad, bf had the club sandwich and corn ham chowder soup..... we just finished the 2 extra bowls we had to order to bring home. Mouth watering, don't miss it, it's delicious!!!! Super cute and homey environment. Great for families or dates!! They were all decorated up for Valentine's Day too. So cute!! Would definitely return!!"}
{"text":"This was on graduation weekend and mother's day, so I am cutting them a little slack since they were busy.  We were able to get reservations for my wife's mom and decided it would be a great idea to take her out on mother's day. When we first got there it was pretty packed, it took five minutes before anyone at the counter acknowledge us.  They sat us down in a booth and an older waitress asked what we would like to drink, we ordered three cocktails and she asked us if we were in a hurry? No we are not, but thanks for asking...The drinks took ten minutes to come out, apparently we should have said we were in a hurry.   For the starters I got the Beef Tenderloin Carpaccio for myself and Shrimp Cocktail for my wife and her mom, both came out fast and were decent taste wise overall. The waitress to me seemed a little spacy and not quite there, we had numerous other waiters/waitresses stop by in between for refills and checking up on us since she wasn't.  For entrees we all ordered the Cider Brined \"Double Cut\" Pork Chops, wait times were roughly 25-30mins. We were anxious to eat it as they were very thick chops, until my wife cut her pork chop open. The center of it was medium rare, borderline rare. Mine was a tad undercooked and also her moms, the waitress even commented and took it all back. They recooked it correctly and ten minutes later we received it back, the meal was above average and we enjoyed it.  Now I normally would let this slip, but the manager proceeded to stop by our table and explain that is how they cook them at Silvercreek and well sorry. I guess the waitress isn't aware of this because she was the one to first point it out. If this is the case, it should be stated on the menu, totally unacceptable and unprofessional behavior as it wasn't really a legitimate apology. The manager there needs etiquette training, you do not act snooty like that to customers.  The desert we decided on was Caramel creme burlee and I have to say it was perfect. It made up a little bit for the disappointing experience, but hardly a reason to return only for that.  Overall my experience was mostly negative with the service and how things operate there, they try to come off as upper scale but it falls flat. The location they are located it is a little bizarre, as right next door you have some sort of vehicle repair shop and things look a bit run down. For what we paid around $150ish and we did tip *More then we should have*, we did not get our moneys worth.  I can't recommend Silvercreek for the service, location, and price. You will find better places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"I don't hand out a lot of five-star reviews but this place definitely deserves one. From the food to the ambience to the helpful and wonderful staff this place has it all. You will definitely not be disappointed here."}
{"text":"The good:  fantastic ambience, very nice staff, great bar, and plenty of parking.  The food is usually good, but consistency is a key, which brings me to the ....  Could-be-better:  mixed results on food - sometimes comes out nice, other times bland, over-cooked and leaves a lot to be desired.  To be fair, they have always been very considerate about it, and have offered to replace my order (even though I wouldn't ask for that).   There is no reason why such a talented team won't nail it every single time.  Conclusion: a very nice restaurant if you want to get something a little bit fancy.  Worth trying.  I'll definitely come back for more, hoping this place will earn its reputation as the best restaurant in Urbana."}
{"text":"Looking for some comfort food I ordered the Grilled Meatloaf. Don't! Thin, salty, and grilled until it was brittle. My mistake. The wine was excellent!"}
{"text":"Generally speaking, the service is good -- I've had some bad ones.  The food is pretty good, but the reason to go is for the brunch.  It can get crowded, but worth the wait.  They make their desserts on site, and make omlettes and waffles while you wait.  The meats can be overcooked, but it's still all quite tasty."}
{"text":"Great food and service although a bit overpriced. I went for the Sunday brunch buffet which was $20 per person. The selection is smaller than what you would get at other buffets, but the quality of the food blows all the others away. I would say that it even rivals other non-buffet restaurants in terms of the quality of the food.   I liked their prime ribs and croissants, they were very fresh, a new batch being brought out once every fifteen minutes. The ribs were flavorful and not under or overcooked in my opinion. Some people may find some of the slices of meat to be too undercooked, but there are plenty to choose from.   One thing that was kind of disappointing is the selection of fruits. There was plenty of meats, vegetables, and baked goods to choose from, but I found the selection of fruits kind of lacking. Their website showed a whole platter of fruits with various melons berries, etc, but there was only a bucket of oranges and lemons (yes whole lemons) that you had to peel yourself. I would expect pictures to be slightly exaggerated, but this is a little too much. Even cheap buffets like Ichiban Chinese Buffet or Hometown will have slices of ready to eat fruit. Just that felt like a glaring hole, considering the price and the otherwise great food and service.  The service is definitely above average and my water was refilled often, and the waiter was prompt at taking my used plates. I felt comfortable eating at Silvercreek, with the restaurant being clean and the friendly staff. Overall a really nice restaurant, but one star off for the lack of fruits and higher price."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the quality of service and the food at Silvercreek!  Headed there for the first time for a friend's birthday with a large group of people.  Since I try to eat vegan and I know it can be a pain to sort that out in a large party, I called ahead to ask if there were any vegan items on the menu.  The hostess was incredibly helpful, pointing me toward a couple of salads and a vegetarian entree that could easily be made vegan, and reassuring me that if nothing on the menu caught my eye, the chef would be more than happy to create something for me with the veggies and pasta they have available.  Service at the restaurant was equally good.  I went with the autumn salad (Garden greens, apricots, pears, grapes, pecans, hazelnut vinaigrette) which was refreshing and delicious, and the stuffed poblano peppers (Black bean, corn & rice stuffing, red onion, cilantro, chihuahua cheese, paquillo pepper sauce) without the cheese.  The peppers were TO DIE for.  The pepper sauce was insane, creamy and delicious, yet somehow dairy free.  I still wish I had gotten that recipe!  I'd definitely recommend Silvercreek for any vegans or non-vegans looking to get a high-quality meal!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is yum ! Tons of good food. Mimosa and bloody' are included. Make sure to arrive early if you don't want to wait"}
{"text":"The greeter there yesterday around noon was SO RUDE. I can't believe they have someone with that attitude works there. The service overall was not as pleasant either. It was my first and last time to be here."}
{"text":"In a word, dissapointed. I thought it would be much better. The bread was boring, my 25.00 Filet had no flavor. My mashed potatos and zuchini were good. My server did not want to be there. There were flies and the grass outside needed mowing and the trash picked up. I had a view of Reds Muffler Shop."}
{"text":"I went there with my family, the food was very good but not quite outstanding.  The service was good The price were fair as well.  We sat in the glass conservatory in the back and it was comfortable in even on a cold night.  This place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"It was a delightful lunch. This is a great case of a score that really needs to be between 3 and 4 stars (so 3.5). Service was okay but was a little slow. Drinks were average no one will call this a cocktail lounge. Our food was solid, a great place I could take my family because there is much variety. The turkey Brie sandwich was good and their salads come with a mini quesadilla. Great patio deserves a plus for that. Pricing is very fair."}
{"text":"After seeing all the negative reviews I was a little hesitant to try this place. But this morning my boyfriend and I drove pass right when they opened their door and my boyfriend said that we should try this place out since other breakfast places were packed with homecoming weekend. I was surprised when I walked through the door, the decor were nice and the hostess was pleasant. Our waitress was nice, she kept our drinks full and came by often to check on us. The food was good, I really liked the prime rib and the mixed green salad was good as well. For those sweets lover, the cake area is the best. It's like being in dessert heaven!    Overall, I really enjoy the service and the food. I would definitely recommend this to others."}
{"text":"I organized a formal dinner for 58 people in Silvercreek's greenhouse group room for my fraternity. It was wonderful.  The room, like the rest of the restaurant, is beautiful and a great setting for a group event. For dinner we served the chicken, prime rib, and a vegetarian dish. Everyone enjoyed their meal. They were consistent and served almost simultaneously.  The patio in the back overlooking the creek is lovely as well.  I would definitely hold a large formal dinner here again."}
{"text":"You could do better a chain restaurant. Food and service are below average and they are not even that busy. Man where is an Outback restaurant in Urbana? I guess it's been here long enough so people send us strangers and visitors here but find somewhere else and do better than here. My second time and won't need to try again."}
{"text":"This was an unexpected fuel stop for a small group of us last weekend after discovering the long wait at the Courier Cafe just up the street.  The restaurant has a warm & cozy feel to it - equipped with a full fireplace and lodge-esque interior.  The bread variety was quite delicious - esp. the olive and rye breads.  I ordered the jumbo shrimp appetizer (the name escapes me), which was incredibly spicy.  It was ok.  I also ordered the spinach salad, which was quite good.  My fiancee ordered the pot roast entree, which I sampled, and it was actually very good.  My friend ordered the brie appetizer, which was also quite tasty.    The only downside was the service, which was slightly lacking.  The price is moderate but nothing completely unreasonable.  They also have a nice selection of domestic and import beverages, which always makes me warm and fuzzy inside."}
{"text":"I look forward to Silvercreek's Sunday brunch and try to go often.  Its always full of great tasting choices and everything is fresh.  Love the make to order omelets and especially the prime rib and ham carving station."}
{"text":"Met friends here for Sunday brunch.  The restaurant spread out the buffet offerings throughout the building.  I had a made-to-order omelette, bacon and a variety other items.  Everything including the mimosa was tasty.  We were sat in their garden house, which on an 85 degree sunny day...I do NOT recommend.  There were 7 of us and all were sweating our butts off by the time we left.  I believe it was about $23 per person.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great food but terrible service and timing. literally called 40 min in advance to make a reservation, just came a few minutes late. now it has been 25 minutes and still waiting to sit. very frustrated!"}
{"text":"I have to say, this has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in Chambana.  I've only visited for lunch and although their dinner menu looks good, I haven't made a trip to try.  I have always had great service and the food has always been wonderful.    The only time I haven't been completely pleased was with the Farro salad which came with veggies, but there were only two quarter pieces of zucchini and two 1-inch slices of asparagus.    This place is now my go-to restaurant for lunch because of the extensive burger and sandwich menu.  They have great sides and the prices are great for the quality of food and creativity."}
{"text":"Great variety of food. Excellent service, the staff very friendly.  Quiet and relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"i really wanted silvercreek to be better than it actually was, especially because it is one of the only fancy sit-down places walking distance from my apartment.  i went on a monday night, the week after valentines day.  my friend and i wanted to start with the mushroom puff pastry appetizer, but the valentines crowd had apparently wiped them out.  so we opted for the potato pancakes, which looked fantabulous...but one bite covered in white wine cream sauce had us puckering up so bad, the sauce was so sour that we could barely finish the first bite.    both of us ordered pasta dishes as our entrees, he the lasagna, i the gnocchi.  the lasagna was ok...really nothing special at all.  the gnocchi was in a subpar tomato sauce, and the gnocchi was overcooked to this dry, powdered mashed potatoes type consistency.  it couldn't choke more than a few dumplings down.   the dessert, however was delicious. warm chocolate brioche bread pudding topped with vanilla ice cream? super-win!  i will be back, if only because i have to check out this friday happy hour that is so well spoken of.  perhaps the steaks and chops, or the chicken and fish are a better choice? we shall see..."}
{"text":"I think it's a pretty good brunch.  I would give it four stars if it wasn't as pricey.  $18 for a brunch buffet is pretty steep, especially since they don't continually serve food in fresh portions.  By the time we got there, the meats and pastas were on the dry side.  The desserts are yummy, omelet was very good, and the variety you can't beat.  I would go earlier and not as often."}
{"text":"It's a mediocre restaurant.   Overpriced ($70 for a salad, two entrees, and a margarita) and the food is not that good - unless you desire pickled vegetables with every meal. Had the chicken with gnocci and I didnt finish per the poor flavor and texture.  My husband had the whitefish and it was fine.  Under its new ownership the menu has changed.  Used to be fine American dining.  Now?  Not sure how to describe the cuisine. More eclectic I guess. The bathrooms are not as clean smelling as before which makes me wonder about food quality. We used to love the Sunday brunch but base on last night, not sure.  We don't want to throw good money after bad.  This used to be a special restaurant for me and my spouse but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Fourth time there, first time for Sunday brunch.  Not too much, not too little food, but what was there was great.  Really dug the peppered fried chicken.  Desert selection was wide and I became a fan of the Bailey's Chocolate Cake.  Was seated in the converted greenhouse which added (positively) to the experience.    Look forward to trying the brunch again.  Only negative (also positive) was the huge crowd."}
{"text":"This is one of the finer restaurants in Urbana, owned by the same people as at Courier Cafe, just up the road.  It loses a couple stars because it wants to be a fine dining establishment with an accompanying pricetag, but the servers are generally not as experienced as you'd like (although they are trying, so it's not right to totally pan them).  And the food quality and inventiveness leaves something to be desired.  They have a good location, dining rooms, including a nice garden room, and it's quite comfortable overall.  It just needs an infusion of talent.  For brunch, four stars."}
{"text":"Just had a pretty disappointing lunch experience here today. Courier Cafe had a 15 minute wait so we decided to hop over here. Not a very smart move. First, it took 5 minutes to be seated because no one was up at the front. Then we got a little sass from the server who sat us because I asked if we could go to a booth instead of the floater table she took us to. The worst part, though, was that it took about 10-15 minutes to order, and then about 20 minutes for our burgers to come. Another couple that had arrived 25 minutes after us got their burgers right after us, so it seemed to be an issue with just our order. Either way, the food wasn't anything spectacular in the end and this visit today left a bad impression on me :/"}
{"text":"On Friday's Sivercreek has 'appyhour that is great! Half price appetizers in the bar area and live music. I love the atmosphere here and the regular Firday night bartendar is great (Brooke). She always knows what to recommend to drink and I hear she makes an amazing Bloody Mary. She prepares them prior to the Sunday brunch, which I still have yet to taste.  The fries are really good with truffle oil and the Steak & blue cheese Quesadillas are excellent. The 'appyhour menu changes regularly, which is nice if you visit often.  They have a large selection of bottled beers and change the tap regularly. They also have a good selection of wine. I just recently relocated to Urbana from Chicago and am happy to have found a place that I can frequent and always leave smiling!"}
{"text":"I was here recently for lunch and went for the Power lunch menu as it was more bang for the buck.  With the Power lunch option i get a cup of soup, an entree from the Power lunch list and a cookie, all for $12. The tomato basil soup was amazing and one of the best I've ever had!  Make sure you ask for bread with your soup as we didn't get bread initially.  For entree,  i got the Spinach Chicken salad which mainly had chicken,  sugared bacon, boiled egg and spinach.  The salad was good but it wasn't a whole lot of salad.  I mean i wouldn't get it if it wasn't part of the Power lunch deal as it was around $12 by itself on the main menu.  The cookie was warm and delicious.  Overall i had a good experience here and with the rustic ambience at this place i feel it would be good for romantic dinners. Might go again to try out their dinner menu."}
{"text":"This is a review of the Sunday brunch which is AWWWWESOME! I usually try to get a group to go to brunch every couple of months and we always come here.  There is so much on the buffet ranging from a waffle station, omelette station, salads, veggies, pasta, salmon, shrimp, potatoes, a carving station, and an absolutely wonderful array of desserts to choose from!    I walk out of here feeling stuffed for days!  While the cost is not cheap- I think it's around $19 including a beverage, it is well, well worth it! I have tried the other top Sunday brunch place in Urbana, and Silvercreek blows them away!  :)"}
{"text":"Yelp steered us here for brunch, but your only option is a buffet.  And it's not good.  My waffle was okay, but the syrup dish had a lot of \"skin\" that had developed in the tray.  Kinda chunky when pouring it out.  The bacon and sausage weren't particularly flavorful.  The \"homemade\" biscuits were hard.  Of all the places we ate in Champaign, this was the worst.  Definitely not worth $20+ for the same kind of Sterno-warmed slop you'd find at Old Country Buffet.  Go get a cup of Jarling's Custard and make that your brunch."}
{"text":"I was really expecting much better things from this restaurant. Based on the good reviews and seemingly more upscale menu, I thought this would be a nicer restaurant with good decor and great food. Well, not so much. My friend and I showed up around 7:30 on a Friday night and the place was only about half full. That should have been our first hint. The restaurant has a rather strange look what with the exposed brick and ceiling beams combined with the country-style tables, carpet, and booths. Overall, it just looked a little dated and old, especially the booths that were in a bit of disrepair.   The dinner menu isn't huge and has a handful of selections for seafood, steaks, and pasta. I opted for the potato-crusted whitefish. It came with a cream sauce, asparagus, mushrooms, and carrots. It came out nicely presented, but when I lifted up the outer potato crust and got a glimpse of the actual fish I was so annoyed. I'm not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that piece of fish was 2x2 inches. Maybe you're not supposed to notice that with all the potato lumped on top of it, but at $18 that was absolutely ridiculous. My friend said her lobster mac and cheese was good, but so rich she could only eat half. And, BTW, it was corkscrew pasta, not macaroni.  Sadly, I didn't order a salad because those actually looked pretty good. And there was also a good looking maple banana cake, but I refused to spend any more money there so I can't attest to the desserts. Overall, this place is way, way overpriced and I would never go back."}
{"text":"I went to Silvercreek for lunch today with my dad-- and I feel like it's undervalued for lunch!  I had pesto rock shrimp pasta ($8.25 and the most expensive lunch item,) and though I wish the menu had mentioned it was a light pesto cream sauce, it was delicious, and the garlic bread was awesome.  My dad had their burger of the day, and he loved it too.  Our waitress was a little spacey, but that'll happen.  Our entire meal including drinks and tip was still under $25; you can get a bill higher than that for lunch at places  with far inferior quality of food."}
{"text":"My bf and I went with another couple to this place as we'd heard great reviews. The ambiance is wonderful and we had a very friendly and attentive server. The food was absolutely delicious. The only downside was they were out of the one dessert we wanted to order but I would definitely go back to dine again (especially to try for the chocolate cake again).  One of the nicer places in Champaign and Urbana - loved it!"}
{"text":"Checked out Silvercreek for lunch, it was very tasty.  My boyfriend and I tried a couple sandwiches, the BLT (topped with goat cheese and guac) and the cuban.  Both were delicious and moderately priced; only about $7-7.50 each (cheaper than some of the other cafes in downtown urbana or champaign).  Service was great, the restaurant was not too busy, would definitely go back again for lunch."}
{"text":"Sorry Silvercreek, but I just can't with you.   I've been here probably 20 times over the course of many years. It's never my choice-- Champaign has a handful of restaurants where everyone goes when they're looking for a somewhat upscale experience and Silvercreek falls into this category. And so I find myself here for graduation celebrations, birthdays, meals for when relatives are visiting, and so on.   Most of my experiences here have been for their Sunday buffet brunch. They offer your standard biscuits, gravy, bacon, potatoes, as well as some lunch-ier fare like pasta and prime rib. It is all less than mediocre. Last time I was there for brunch, my dad said, \"We should have gone to Ryan's.\" Ouch. They have a pretty big selection of desserts. It really grinds my gears that even though they have an omelet and waffle station, they can't make eggs to order because they only have a big bowl of premade egg mix on hand. So yeah, no fresh eggs on hand. They have scrambled eggs in the buffet line but... gross.   Side note, try not to get seated by the omelet station. It gets boiling hot. Last time I was here, I actually dunked my cloth napkin in my water and dabbed my face and neck with it. I mentioned the heat to the hostess on the way out-- she asked how the meal was-- and her response was \"Oh, in the greenhouse? Yeah, hot day.\" No, not in the greenhouse. But that reminds me...  My best friend had her bridal shower at Silvercreek about a year ago, in the greenhouse. In the middle of the meal, one of the chandeliers DROPPED FROM THE CEILING and shattered on the middle of a table. Unreal. The staff did not know how to handle the situation and the only compensation was free dessert. This place is such a mess."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch & were pleasantly surprised. The selection was vast - with choices like prime rib at the carving station, salad, lox, poached salmon, biscuits & gravy, quiche, flourless chocolate cake, creme brulée, fruit, coffee, juice, shrimp cocktail, citrus bars, brownies... I didn't even try everything available! About $25 per person for brunch. Service was excellent. Our drinks were perpetually filled without even asking. Even though it was pretty crowded, the food was refreshed & our server was attentive. We wandered out from brunch happy & fulfilled."}
{"text":"Not very professional. It wants to be fine dining but the staff lacks training an the menu options are less than impressive. When I walked in there was no one greeting so me and another group stood around for a while not knowing what to do. The host then showed up and after a time of her not knowing why she was at work and why I was there I literally had to say \"I'm here to eat food\" before she clued in to seat me. Nice building. As a business, needs improvement."}
{"text":"Been here several times over the years and have never been impressed.   The waiters are slow and unresponsive.   The food is mediocre and has always taken a long time to reach the table.  For example, once ordered a steak, asked for medium rare but got well-done, so I sent it back. The waiter was hesitant but took it to the kitchen. After coming back, the waiter was argumentative and said the chef said that is how it is supposed to be.   Paid the overpriced bill and left. Don't care to return, which is a shame because I like the ambiance and want to support local restaurants."}
{"text":"Incredible brunch service! My family booked three tables in the Greenhouse on a recent Sunday and we could not have been more pleased. The selection of breakfast/lunch foods was borderline overwhelming, but in a good way. Of course they have the classics - waffles, bacon, eggs, sausage - and then many more premium choices like prime rib, lox, and shrimp cocktail. There is also a fabulous dessert selection for those with more of a sweet tooth. The servers are quick to refill a drink or pick up an empty plate and were more than kind and tolerant of our group which was frequently moving around and staging photos in the middle of a booming time slot. I would absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch while visiting from out of town!  The food was fresh with great variety and excellent service!  I recommend this as a nice casual brunch when you want to enjoy your company and great food!"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day and everything was great! The greenhouse area was a little chilly (understandably) but aesthetically pleasing. Staff were super nice too."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm a sucker for all-you-can-eat brunches, which Silvercreek happens to host every Sunday. While most places will have you tearing apart trying to decide between savory vs sweet, here you don't have to choose. And you can have 7 different cakes if you want, whatever no judging. It's pricey for this option though, so you'll need to come hungry and have an ability to eat a lot to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Went here for an anniversary a while back with the idea that it was one of the nicer places in town. I did have high expectations and was a bit disappointed. I do like the rustic ambiance, but the menu has little to no imagination and the wine list is quite small. I would suggest the lobster Mac-n-cheese though."}
{"text":"Went for brunch here on a Sunday. The after church crowd really packed the place. The tables of food were scattered all around the place. Seemed to me with no organization at all. Worst of all the omelet station was put into as corner by the bar where two people at most could get to it And multiple tables around there as well so people were trying to get by and eventually giving up on waiting like I did because the two cooks were so unorganized and cooking on dorm room skillets. Definitely not worth $20. Pretty good food but not $20 a person food and experience overall."}
{"text":"Out for a birthday with a party of 10.  Kate was our server and was absolutely smashing!  Everyone was extremely happy with their meals, and Kate came through in clutch with some on point fresh homemade apple sauce.  Here is how it went down:  Opa (my 90 year old fresh off the boat German grandmother) wanted some apple sauce to compliment  her duck (which was cooked perfectly and was delightly delectable).  She asked Kate if she had any apple sauce in the back, which she did not.  I inquired if they had fresh apples in the back, and Kate said she believed that they did.  I then jokingly replied that she had all she needed to make some apple sauce, all she needed was a little determination.  We all had a good laugh and Kate opened the next bottle of wine (their selection is quite good) and left the table.  We continued our meal when all of the sudden out of nowhere Kate appears with a small dish of fresh hand made applesauce that was on point (which means amazeballs).  Needless to say the service was some of the best I have had in quite some time and the food was delicious.  I would tell you that you need to get off your butt, out of those sweats, ditch the order the same chain store pizza idea and head to Silvercreek for dinner tonight.  Real talk."}
{"text":"A friend and I went there for Sunday Brunch.  Now this is $20.95 so we had great expectations.  However, none of the chafing dishes had any flame under them so the food was cold....cold gravy over little biscuits the size of a poker chip and the consistency of a hockey puck were awful...cold jambalya, cold macaroni and cheese....everything was cold.  The shrimp for the shrimp cocktail was so over-cooked as to be mushy.  The waffles were cold...I should have waited in the long line to have one made fresh....For the price I would NOT recommend, nor would I go back."}
{"text":"We love the atmosphere and the food is always good. Friday night happy hour has half price bar bites and $3 beer. The music is always goid"}
{"text":"The best food I've had in ages!  Ambiance is unique: relaxed but casual sheik. Bekka Is an amazing waitress.  I ordered the 6oz fillet, mashed potatoes, Spinach salad. So good.  You won't be sorry visiting Silvercreek."}
{"text":"We have been to Silvercreek several times for lunch, dinner and special occasions (booked events in the greenhouse).  I've always noted good service and the food is very good, especially the house-made breads.    This past weekend we tried the brunch for the first time and were delighted!  It is quite an extravagant lunch with MANY options, and they were constantly refilling the trays so everything was fresh!  The waffles were fantastic, light and fluffy, the salads were fresh, and the hot items were flavorful.  I was struck, as a vegetarian, with how many green vegetable options I had!  Brussels sprouts, broccoli, zucchini with cherry tomatoes, spinach salad, cucumber salad!  For meat eaters, there were all sorts of coldcuts, fish and seafood, fried chicken, beef and ham.  And save room for dessert, there are almost as many dessert items available as there are main course, so many cakes!  Along with tarts, candy, apple crisp, bread pudding (which wasn't very good, the only thing I didn't like at all), trifle and fruit.  This is the perfect place to bring visiting family or have a nice brunch out with friends.  Service for us was good, though I did have a bit of a wait once for a water refill.  The only thing that was kind of surprising was the treatment of the line/where the buffet is set up, it's not ideal but it seems to work so-so."}
{"text":"Have come here several times for lunch as I work close by at Carle. I'm very impressed with Silvercreek. Food is consistently excellent. Have sampled many things and it's all very tasty. Also service is super quick. We are in and out in enough time to get back to work. Also nice ambiance. No brainer  A+"}
{"text":"Traveling through town and used Yelp to find a place to eat. Nearby first choice was too crowded, found this place around the corner. Beautiful interior, excellent service and delicious food. Stuffed mushrooms, chicken breast, both terrific. Hot bread slightly sweet with real butter couldn't have been better. Too full for dessert then but couldn't resist taking chocolate cake for later. Not disappointed. Not a cheap dinner but what a treat!"}
{"text":"without a doubt absolutely the best most unique burger around.  I'm surprised more people do not know about it. When family visits from out of town they insist on me taking them here for the burgers. If you like burgers and live in or near this town and you haven't had the Silvercreek burger, I encourage you to check it out.  I'm talking freshly ground beef that is not flattened like a pancake,but delicately formed into an uber thick loosly molded mound of juicy beefy goodness, housemade bun similar to brioche, and if you like your burger cooked to a specific doneness, ie medium, Medium rare,etc.. it will actually arrive at the table the way you had requested it."}
{"text":"Went there for NYE at the early set for Candy Foster.  He was the best part of the visit.  Ashley our server was good.  I ordered the scallops and could not eat them as they were raw and only barely grilled.  The sprouts had been warm at onetime but were also cold.  My friend ordered the duck and it was good.  It was a very expensive meal for something I could not eat.  Next time a salad for me.  I only went for the music and I guess that's what I got:("}
{"text":"Best Sunday Brunch in Town ! - great selection of breakfast food items (waffle, sausage, bacon, pancakes) roasted meats (salmon, roast beef, ham, fried chicken), vegetables (different types salads), fruits, including an egg station where you can make request for eggs to be cooked in the way that you like, cakes and mini cakes. Mimosas are half price. Busy crowd that thins after 12. Come early or go later. Busy between 10-12 on Sundays. Overall a wide selection of food for $22.95 before tax. A little pricey but worth it. Wait staff was helpful and attentive, refilling food when needed. Even the manager was helping out. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is one of the nicer places to go for a fancy meal.  The decor is quite nice.. the service can be a hit or miss.  I would NOT go for their Sunday brunch.  I think it's kind of expensive and they pretty serve the leftovers from Saturday night.  I really like their steaks.  Those are pretty good.  Nothing else really stood out in my mind.  I think I would rather go to Timpone's (see my review) and pay the same price.  The only thing you just don't get is the as-nice-decor."}
{"text":"Here Price = Quality. Brunch on Sunday is the best I've been to in the longest. Only upset feeling from trying their desserts is for the people who DIDN'T try the desserts."}
{"text":"This reserved and quiet restaurant feels a little off the beaten path. Food is squarely aimed at a middle American palette and isn't particularly exciting. Clientele is largely from the business community seeking a decent meal served within the confines of the noon hour break. I've been generally satisfied with my choices here. I think the steak salad is probably my favorite, and the hamburger features a big patty and fresh ingredients. It's a good choice for a working lunch, maybe not so much for a hot date."}
{"text":"This place wants to be better than it actually is. The ambiance is really quite nice. They did a great job restoring the building and the grounds. It is beautiful, and it was also  the first smoke-free restaurant in town. I very much appreciated that at the time.   The food wants to be outstanding, but it is only very good. For as much as this place costs, I want it to be better. More innovative, more spectacular. The wait staff is mostly very young and not quite experienced enough to pull off the fine dining experience. One time, one of them addressed my dining companion as \"dude.\" He took offense, and rightly so. We are not your surfin' buddies, we are your customers.   That said, this is a great place for a big celebratory dinner with your whole family. It's a beautiful setting, the wine and beer lists are good, and your grandmother will be able to find something she wants to eat. So will your vegetarian cousin and her picky five-year-old, and so will you."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium rare steak, which was cooked correctly, but switched up with another diner's well done steak. We switched plates, no big deal. The steak itself was dry, chewy, and flavorless. The service was nothing of note either way. I ordered a Tom Collins and myself and my party were unable to tell if it was virgin or not. Even if it wasn't a virgin drink, it was an inexcusably small and undetectable amount of alcohol. I wont be returning and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Not many young people were eating here but the atmosphere was great. I had the trainwreck sandwich. It was loaded with meat and the bread was freshly made. Everyone else in my party had a gourmet burger and everything was devoured. My husband said when his family comes to visit he will be taking them here."}
{"text":"So this is a fancy establishment that exudes an aura of fine dining. It almost feels as if there should be a business casual dress code. Almost. I ordered the most basic macaroni dish. I wish the menu listed all the items that come with these dishes since I don't enjoy onions (it comes with green onions). The dish definitely was a bit better than your standard macaroni fare, but I don't think it's good enough to warrant an $18 price tag.   The Sunday buffet is similar. It costs $20 and the food is a bit better than your standard buffet food, but not enough to warrant the much higher price."}
{"text":"The owner took his time to message me and dealt with the greeter's situation after my review, which is very impressive. Not all business owners do that. I will go back visit for sure."}
{"text":"Very good buffet on Sunday. Very fresh shrimps and fishes. The desserts are too sweet for me but I saw many other people queueing to grab those cakes. Beef is also great."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch twice and have had the turkey and brie sandwich and the salmon and quinoa salad. Both were good.  I have yet to try the brunch. I was a little annoyed at their request for people to pay cash- the card at the table said that if you pay cash, you can ASK for a 3% discount. I paid with cash and the server took my check away before I could ASK for a discount, so when my check came back there was no discount because I had not asked for it. Here's my thing- I realize that it costs the establishment money every single time someone uses plastic, but if you are going to offer a discount, just give it automatically  when there is cash used. The day I was there a commercial was being filmed right during lunch so most people were paying attention to that, perhaps that's why it was missed."}
{"text":"I had the Kale Caesar salad and I loved it. The bread with the olive oil was great too. Their menu is very creative and all dishes were very well thought out and prepared. I had their special for the night which was a fantastic salmon. I'd go again in a heartbeat. Pricey but a great place to have a formal dinner."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with some co-workers for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised!  This place has a reputation for being overpriced however,  I didn't see anything on the lunch menu over $15. I won't say it's world class food or anything (only slightly better than Courier Cafe) but very well prepared and is good for people looking for classic American dishes - no weird exotic ingredients here!  3/4/15 UPDATE  Came in with some co-workers during Urbana Restaurant Week for my birthday. What a great deal! $10 per person and I left absolutely stuffed. While the service was a bit slow, it was really good. They even brought out dessert for the table for my birthday and accommodated the gluten free eaters as well!"}
{"text":"Dad's day needs a step up on the C-U restaurant ladder, don't you think?  We made a reservation at Silvercreek and were so glad to have this beautiful, WARM and welcoming spot to retire to after another bitter loss on the field.  The lunch menu is not quite as diverse as the dinner menu but we all loved our entrees.  We started with the corn chowder which was filling and nuanced.  My husband had the special pork tenderloin and my daughter and I had the vegetable ravioli - rich and delicious.  Plus the best bread basket in town.  I was a tad diaspointed in the chocolate cake - beautiful but the taste was dull.  That cake looked so much better than it tasted.  Had the dessert been better, this would be a five.  I have been there multiple times and have long felt this is the weak link in an otherwise great restaurant.  When the football team disappoints, the food will not!   I L L  I N I"}
{"text":"The food was good, but it doesn't outweigh the management practices. The experience was bordering on a nightmare. Definitely a stressful and extremely unpleasant dream.  Graduation day at U of I. Reservations were made far in advance. We had a 9pm reservation with a $50 required deposit. When we walked in a few minutes before 9, we found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with angry and annoyed patrons. We spoke to several people who had been waiting to be seated 1, 2, and even 2 and a half hours AFTER their reservation time. They know how to take a reservation, just not how to keep the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation.  So, due to the $50 required credit card deposit, all those people were stuck waiting and waiting and waiting. After waiting an hour, we asked what would happen if we left, and they said they would charge us $50. I'm pretty sure this wouldn't hold up in a court of law, but the small claims filing fee is more than $50 so they have people hooked.   When we were finally seated an hour and a half after our \"reservation\" time, the 5 of us were squished into a small booth with a chair at the end. There was no space for that chair. It was very uncomfortable. Were our drinks comped? Were we offered anything for our long wait? No.   The server was very nice, but we were starved and exhausted and really annoyed. The food was great, but way overpriced. I had \"little parcels\" pasta filled with cheese. Really great. The taste was worth 5 stars.   I find management's policy on the U of I graduation date coupled with their failure to keep reservations absolutely unacceptable. It is completely unnecessary, their restaurant would be packed skipped reservations or not. The management decided to take this opportunity to swindle people."}
{"text":"I had a reservation at 830pm. I have been here for 35 minutes, I paid 130 dollars for the reservation and the blond lady just came to tell me she does not have a table for 13 and that I have to wait."}
{"text":"Fisrt time visit to this restaurant and I'm very impressed!!! I give a big thumbs up to every category. Food is very tasty, Service is very friendly (Even a trainee server). Love this place already and I'm sure I became reg.customer if I live near by."}
{"text":"Skip the Power Lunch.  I ordered a Turkey Brie w Sweet Potatoe Fries on their Power Lunch menu.  Unfortunately, the entire entree was a big disappoint. The bread was soggy and the fries, seasonless and soggy as well.  Additionally, the brie was just unevenly placed in the sandwich. There were caramelized onions but that did not help the flavor - the sandwich was just flavorless and, I have to repeat, soggy. Huge disappointment. (Also, I did not get all the items in the Power Lunch. The cookie was missing. The bag was double- tied when I arrived, and I did not check it.) I did enjoy the tomatoe basil bisque that came with the Power Lunch.  Everything else went into the trash, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is warm and comfortable. Waitstaff is attentive but mostly young and inexperienced. Food was... Ok. Ordered the mixed grill special. Gremolata ( overpowering and chemical flavor) on over-cooked scallops, undercooked fingerling potatoes and a passable steak with uninspired brown sauce poured over. Overall, quite \"ok\" but no better. Highlight was the dessert, a chocolate cake with ganache and mousse. Best part of the meal was feeling welcome to linger and chat, which we certainly did."}
{"text":"When I was about to leave Champaign for Chicago, my boss and I went on a culinary tour around Chambana and Silvercreek was on the top of our list. She was raving about the Sunday brunch and they were right, it was so so good.   There's an egg station if you want your eggs custom made. Then there's other fancy meats, fish like whole smoked salmon, pastries, and of course, desserts.  The price tag is expensive for the Chambana area but the food selection will all be worth it. This is a must do for anyone in town."}
{"text":"Good service, food and ambience. Convenient location as well. A little pricey on their beer and wine prices. Overall, worth a visit."}
{"text":"I ate here for my Graduation dinner. The service was pretty good and the food was decent. They have a pretty extensive menu and the atmosphere is great. The outside and surrrounding property at this place is awesome! I got some great pictures here with my family!"}
{"text":"I tip my hat to Silvercreek and their amazing staff for accommodating my rather large family during my father's funeral. I know we were boisterous, but they didn't blink an eye and served us like royalty with quality food & beverages. We had called ahead initially to Longhorn Steakhouse (my mother's favorite) who informed us they wouldn't accept a party our size. A sibling and I had each had very good experiences with Silvercreek and were able to persuade my mother. This is now her favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have been able to say it in the past, but Silvercreek is checking off all the boxes in my book. As usual, the atmosphere is comfortably casual. The wait staff professionally attentive without being intrusive, and whomever the chef is in the kitchen is cooking up some magic.  All these parts come together like a grand symphony skillfully orchestrated by the ever effervescent sprite of a woman, Grace.  To have Grace greet you at the door when you arrive at Silvercreek is like taking that first sip of Champagne where the bubbles tickles your nose and leaves you wanting for more."}
{"text":"Amazing place for the sunday brunch. The waffles and maple syrup are amongst the best you will get in town! Don't miss out on the enticing array of deserts, it is easy to, since there is such a wide variety of food before it!"}
{"text":"1.  There was no wait for dinner (summer, around 6pm). 2.  Service was great.  We got water and bread pretty quickly, and they checked on us regularly, but not breathing down our necks. 3.  Food was ok.   - Truffle fries:  kind of just fries with some thick grated cheese on top, but not bad.  A large plate, so totally shareable between 3- 4 people. - Spinach Tagiatelle (vegetarian):  not seasoned enough.  There were enough tomatoes, mushrooms, and asparagus bits to make it colorful and interesting, but the dish itself was just ok.  I tasted, for the most part, pepper.    The other person who ordered a burger got fries that were very overdone.  Overall, it was just ok.  Perhaps not worth another trip."}
{"text":"We haven't been to Silvercreek in years - we were disappointed with the food. Rumor spread that they got a new manager.  We decided to give them another try.   The Chef's Line Burger is best burger in town - no exageration. Even my wife thinks so and she does not like to eat burgers. Tonight we enjoyed the appetizer buffet with oysters, chicken, shrimp, salads, artichoke dip, fresh fruit and chef cooked steak on the grill - delicious. You must try the Peach Kuchen to finish your meal.   Silvercreek is now our local favorite. If you haven't been lately you must give them a try."}
{"text":"Restaurant review Being 2.5 hours away from Chicago, I am still looking for a great modern America cuisine restaurant that is not simply a steak house. Silvercreek is likely the best that Champaign has to offer, but it still falls short of a 4 or 5 star dining experience in Chicago. As soon as you step into the restaurant, the all brick wall and wood ceiling interior adds a bit of class to your meal. We went in the summer time, but I can imagine how rustic it would feel in the winter with the large fireplaces that are along the adjacent wall. The server was quick to take our orders and get the kids meals out first with the appetizer. We went with the appetizer sampler which had the shrimp cocktail served with blue cheese mousse with cocktail sauce (FYI they serve it in such a weird shot glass that I thought it was an oyster in cocktail sauce....), calamari fried exceptionally well, marinated olives with a sweet zest, and duck prosciutto wrapped dates. It was nice trying a bunch of apps on plate. My duck entree is where it losses some stars as only 3/4 of this was cooked well, the other 1/4 was too well done on the chewy side. The cauliflower and parsnip puree along with the shiitake mushroom roasted cauliflower complemented the dish well especially the freshness of the vegetables. I am also very concern why there was a dark blue discoloration in the duck breast as noted in my picture. The redeeming quality is the extensive options on the menu and some farm to table elements.  Pros: refined menu that utilizes many components to the dish, special dinner menu, Sunday brunch  Cons: What is up with the blue discoloration in the duck breast and 1/4 of it was way over done  Hidden deals: 1. Sunday brunch buffet- I need to come back and give this a try 2. Pre-fixe menu- not advertised on the website 3 course meal for 29.99 3. Global Wednesday- unique foods from around the world 4. Live music Friday night"}
{"text":"I had eaten here a little over a year ago and it was one of the worst places I had eaten in the Champaign/Urbana area. I had recently been back and all I can say is WOW! The food is absolutely amazing. I returned here every Friday for 3 weeks after my return visit. Amazing wine, food and service. They had live music when I was there which was fantastic. The bread basket was great as well. 5/5 on all marks, decor, service, beverage, food and price. I will definitely be returning many times in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch for a decent price! I don't know why everybody is bitching so hardcore about this place. I almost didn't try this place because of all the one star reviews but my grandma loves the creme brûlée here so we went.  I had the lunch combo: half the gourmet grilled cheese (awesome), tomato basil soup (amazing), and sweet potato french fries (nothing to rave about but nothing bad with them).  For dessert we had the vanilla creme brûlée topped with fresh blueberries and strawberries. AMAZING!   We both had lunch, a dessert, and each an herbal tea (great selection of herbal teas!) and the total was only $34.50.  They also have a nice outdoor area to sit."}
