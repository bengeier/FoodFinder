{"text":"Amazing Ecuadorean food prepared from the heart, just like at home! Ingredients are always fresh, the food is very delicious and the portions are great. The owner cooks the food himself and is constantly checking in to make sure the customers are satisfied. 

I usually have pescado frito. A whole fried fish served with rice, fried plantains and an avocado salad. Don't forget to ask for the homemade spicy sauce! 

Their empanadas are a yummy staple here too. There are the beef empanadas which are savoury and include pieces of potato and olives. There are also cheese empanadas which can be rolled in sugar and which make a sweet end to a delicious meal."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try a couple of years ago. We were heading down to Ecuador and wanted to sample some of the cuisine first.  I have been eating here regularly ever since as the food is awesome!

My favourite menu item for sure is Hornado (slow roasted pork). It is a huge serving that comes with potato cakes, salad, and your choice of hominy or rice.  The Churrasco is also pretty killer. They have a bunch of different main dish options here and snacks like empanadas and humitas.

This place is definitely worth checking out. It's tucked in a little strip mall at Perth and Dupont.  They are only open Friday to Sunday and it's cash only."}
{"text":"I have only had the beef empanada with black olives $2 and cheese with sugar on top  $1.50 tax included. Both awesome. The people who work here are young and really nice."}
{"text":"Just finished our first meal here. Huge portions, all handmade with love and attention. The ceviche was my personal favourite, not too acidic, but completely delicious - the shrimp are served whole, which I like.

The Hornado was delicious, and the Churrasca was huge and satisfying. We will definitely be back soon. Mainly to try the empanadas and tamales!

Warning: cash only!"}
