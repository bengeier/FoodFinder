{"text":"This place is quite a find.  A very eclectic memo and fine service.  I enjoyed a white sauce pizza and my wife enjoyed one of the nightly specials.  Service is good!"}
{"text":"I was at Oliva's this evening with an acquaintance and within 5 min after we had paid our waiter came to the table to tell us the restaurant was expecting a large number of reservations and to please hurry up.  Only half the restaurant was occupied and there was absolutely no one waiting to be seated. I have never been told that by a waiter before in my life nor have I ever felt so unwelcome."}
{"text":"I spent a little over $12 for the worst breakfast I've ever had... I should have just went straight to Starbucks for much cost effective breakfast.  I ordered a breakfast wrap and the worst Americano ever; I tasted like watered down drip coffee.  I never order Americano outside of Starbucks and I should have stayed to what I know.  Disappointment."}
{"text":"Referred here by family we were visiting in Middleton. Beautiful and comfortable decor, the  cuisine is Mediterranean with Turkish highlights. As advertised every dish is made with fresh ingredients in house and is delicious! We had baba ganush, shepherd salad and lamb shish kebab. Authentic Turkish coffee added to a unique and satisfying experience. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"For a coffee lover like myself, I believe they have the best coffee in town.  Their coffee's are organic and full of flavour, their chocolate danish melts in your mouth. Friendly and trendy atmosphere for catching up with your friends or just grabbing a drink and getting some work done. They have super friendly staff and I loved their second floor. Cozy and hip!"}
{"text":"Has Oliva changed owners? Our experience there last night was nothing like previous times. First, they no longer start you off with flatbread; instead it's your typical Italian bread. Second, they were terribly understaffed; the host was also the waiter for half the restaurant. Third, we waited for over an hour for our meal. When our food finally arrived, the chicken was unbelievably salty. Very disappointing -- I don't think we'll be going back again."}
{"text":"This place is great! Here are the most delicious things I've tried there: -lamb kebobs -chicken parmesan -red lentil soup -even the house dressing on the salads -baklava-- best in town -other Turkish eggplant dishes.  The only possible improvements are not even with the food! Things like fresh flowers, seat cushions and/or table candles would add ambiance and comfort but the bottom line is the food is amazing. Note: they also do delivery."}
{"text":"My sister and I went to lunch here for her birthday.  The food was great and the service was friendly.  The reason why I am only giving this an okay is because the waiter kept leaning over the booth I was sitting in to place food/drinks/bill on our table.  The first time it happened, we thought, it's just a bread refill.  When he continued to do this the remainder of our meal, we couldn't believe it.  Was it too much trouble to walk around the other tables to stand next to our table?"}
{"text":"First impression, server was rude. He didn't know the menu, tried to correct us on the menu items, and told us that they don't have any Turkish wine (a quarter of the menu).  The hummus was unexceptional. The salad came with store bought dressing. My wife did not get a water refill by the ambivalent waiter until after the main course arrived.   Our dinners were relatively bland. The gyro, and it is generic gyro not Turkish doner, is kronos. The tzatziki is store bought. My wife's shish kabob came with four chunks for $15.   Overall, uninspired cuisine, an inaccurate menu, and shoddy service will not bring us back."}
{"text":"The service is ok. He informed us about the special of the day, my husband n our friend ordered it, lamb delight ...something. I ordered lamb kebab n hummus. The house bread was good very light inside and crispy outside. Hummus came with nothing and tasteless. When I asked he said he will bring more house bread which long after that. When their special came they turned out that around the plate was hummus which we thought he should have told us for we did not have to order it. My husband said there nothing special and they should have put more lamb. I was served with 3 small pieces of lamb, rice and salad which i quite agreed it should be more. The taste is ok, kebab usaully is only skewered n grilled. You cannot be wrong. So i give them 2 stars cuz the taste is just ok. The portion is less for the price. And some other points of the service."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I still love the food from this restaurant, i have to say they are pretty consistent in their food, however, they really need to work on their customer service, I have been there twice and I had placed a few orders over the phone and all the servers are rude, they make you feel you are bothering them all the time, I dont know if the owner is aware of this or not but seriously, I cannot believe how servers can treat customers bad; I dont go or call to this restaurant more often ONLY because of the rude attitude of the people who work there."}
{"text":"We first went to Oliva about 2 years ago, and absolutely loved it. Last time, a couple of weeks ago, was a huge disappointment and suggests that this restaurant has seen better days.   Although it's hard to recall precisely what made our first visit so special, I do remember especially the accompanying rice. It was prepared as I've never had rice before, served in an attractive mound and glistening making it very tempting to eat. The flavor was good and the texture on the firm side. Knowing that the owners are Turks, I later researched to see if I could find out what made it so delectable and special. I learned that Turkish rice is often made with a bit of pasta added, and then I remembered those small white pieces among the rice grains. It was orzo, but I'm sure there was something more than that as the dish was exceptional. The rest of our meal was tasty and memorable that day too.   But our visit a couple of weeks ago was quite the opposite. The rice mound was completely undistinctive, ie. no orzo, no spices embedded, and just something you eat to fill up, not to savor. Before that was served with the entree, however, I had lentil soup. That was a huge disappointment as well. Must have come from the top of the pot where few lentils resided because it was very watery with just as few lentils and nothing else of substance either. My lamb shish kabob was just okay. Somewhat hard and dried out, as if it came from a warmer not fresh from the broiler or oven.   Their prices are reasonable for good mediterranean food with an occasional Turkish bent. However, the few people at the restaurant on a Friday evening suggets to me that we're not the only ones who became disappointed with Oliva over time."}
{"text":"My wife's and my favorite restaurant in Madison.  Can't count the number of times we've eaten there (once already this week) over the past year.  The appetizer combo is fantastic with the bread they serve at the table.  Order a Peroni to drink, then treat yourself to a calzone or shish kabob.  The calzones are incredible, and the rice that comes with the shish kabobs is really great...not sure why, but it is."}
{"text":"The place my wife and I go most often for our date nights and we haven't been disappointed yet. We've taken friends and family there and they've all loved it. All the food we've had is really well prepared and tastes great and we end up full, many times walking out with doggy bags. Highly recommend the grape leaf wrapped salmon they regularly have as a special. Only disappointment was going on Valentine's Day without a reservation and being turned away. Also can expect to need a reservation on Friday evenings."}
{"text":"I learned a lesson today... You can't always go off reviews!  I still like Yelp and will continue to read and write reviews... BUT... I won't take it as seriously as I have been thus far.   I have been avoiding going to Oliva because of the mixed reviews.  Today, we decided to give it a try. I am happy we did!  The server, Megan, was very nice and accommodating.  I have food allergies, and I appreciate the fact that she went back and double checked the ingredients on the things that I ordered.  She seemed confident at first when I had questions, which honestly, makes me uneasy.  I prefer the server to always check with the chef or owner.  She did that on her own, so that was great.  The bread was amazing!! Perfectly warm, toasty, and soft at the same time.  We got the combo veggie appetizer- all 4 things were very tasty. I also had the veggie stew that was very good, but it came out on a plate... I think it'd be easier to eat out of a bowl.  My husband enjoyed the meatball sandwich and my son liked the kid's gyro.  All in all, the service was great and the food was yummy! We'll be back! Too bad we waited so long to enjoy this place!  To each their own though, right?!"}
{"text":"I went to Oliva's for my birthday lunch  I had never been there before but had passed by it often and decided I wanted to try it.  I was warmly greeted and was offered a beverage while I waited for the rest of my party.  The waiting area in front of the fireplace was very nice for this cold and damp day.  The food was very good and it was difficult to make a decision.  Oliva is a mediterranean italian restaurant.  I had the gyro entree and it was delicious and the bakala was excellent.  I highly recommend it and plan to return.  Also, the atmosphere is very nice."}
{"text":"I've been intending to go here since it first opened (since it's been called the west side Bunky's, which is a fav of mine), but didn't get a chance until just last week.   We had the olive tapenade with bread as an appetizer, which I really liked (although my dining companion was unimpressed - \"it's just olives\").  The bread was okay, but cold and a little hard.  I had a $2 soda (really, $2 for a glass of soda and I don't even get offered a refill?) and my date chose from the sparse beer selection.   My soup came quickly, but was lukewarm.  I was expecting greatness, but it was mediocre.  I much prefer Bunky's lentil soup.   I had the chicken kebab and my date had the BBQ chicken calzone.  Both were a disappointment.  Maybe because I was comparing it to Bunky's chicken shawarma, which is perfect - thinly sliced, nicely seasoned, plenty of charred vegetables, yummy rice, fabulous hummus, and great yogurt sauce.  Oliva's chicken was huge chunks, poorly seasoned, maybe 4 small pieces of onion and 1 of pepper, bland rice, no hummus, and way-too-dilly yogurt sauce.     I tried the calzone, which was okay, but we both agreed the calzones at Benvenuto's are better (and bigger) even though they aren't the greatest either.   I was ready for this to be my new \"go-to\" place on the west side.  Guess not."}
{"text":"Quaint Mediterranean restaurant with great food.   The red lentil soup is excellent and the falafels are the best I've had in a long time. The one negative I've found is that the service is very slow.  I've never had to wait for a table but I did have to wait a long time before our waitress took our order.  It did not take long to get our food but again took a long time to get our check.  If service were better I  would give them 5 stars.   The food is very good.   I will definitely return when I'm back in Madison."}
{"text":"Been meaning to go here for ages and finally remembered it while trying to decide where to eat. last night  We wanted to go someplace on the west side, so I suggested this to my husband.  The interior of the restaurant is understated.  Service was prompt and friendly.  There were a lot of options on the menu, and I had a hard time deciding what to order.  Since it was just the two of us, we decided to forgo any appetizers.  I definitely want to go back with more people and order the appetizer variety plate.  I finally settled on the falafel.  My husband got the shrimp mediterranean.  We were both very pleased with our dinners and easily cleaned the plates.  I'm fairly certain it was the best falafel I have ever had, and I have tried falafel many, many places.  It was not at all dry, but super moist and perfectly flavored.  Highly recommend.  I had a bite of the shrimp dish and it was also really tasty.  Lots of vegetables and the shrimp were decently sized.  I plan on returning, and I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Just a quick review of their pizzas. We often order an extra large veggie pizza with pepperoni added. They are consistently outstanding, the crust is light and flaky (really one of the best I have had), and they are generous with the ingredients which are always very fresh. It is a great pizza that actually seems pretty healthy when we don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"We've been eating here since they first opened next door as a tiny restaurant. People stood in line out the door to get a table, and for good reason.  Service is always excellent, the food has never disappointed. My husband eats from the traditional Italian menu options and I eat from the the traditional Mediterranean options. Something for everyone! Fair prices too."}
{"text":"Offers Italian and Turkish cuisine, hard to go wrong when this place is just down the road. Their bread doesn't look like anything special but is excellent -- light, crisp edges, pillowy soft inside. Both loaves we received were freshly baked and still hot from the oven. Table olive oil has a delicate, wonderful flavor. For dinner (served with soup or salad), I had the Nohutlu Ishpanak (sauteed combination of vegetables and chickpeas served with excellent rice) and my dining companion the Turkish Delight (braised lamb with vegetables over hummus), and both were quite good. Prices reasonable ($13-16), nice but still casual dining ambiance. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"The Home made bread was really good with the olive oil they provided. I had the special food which the waiter recommended us. It was a grilled salmon in the green leaf and had a green sauce on the top. It's served with mediteranian style cooked rice. The flavor of all three together was just perfect.  Chef knew how to cook salmon very well.  Another dish I tried was a chicken kebab. The taste was really good as well.  However, the food portion  was a bit  small when u compared with the price. Maybe it compensates with the welcome bread they serve."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for gyros but looking for something a little more upscale than a trip to Parthenon, this is your place to go.  The gyro plate is served with rice and a small salad.  The red lentil soup and fresh bread is delicious.  They also serve the best calzone I have found in Madison.  Atmosphere is cozy, and service has been decent on every visit."}
{"text":"The red lentil soup, shrimp artichoke and imam fainted were out of the world. The service was fantastic as well"}
{"text":"I've actually never written a review before but this place was bad enough to get me started. The food here is terrible. My chicken Parmesan was on par with a hungry man frozen dinner, and my wife's fettuccine Alfredo was overly garlicky and they didn't thicken the sauce at all so it was just heavy cream on the plate. Bread was good and the wine portions are generous."}
{"text":"Not exactly what I expected- small dining room, very un-pretentious, odd mix of turkish and italian. Somehow it works though. I had to stop myself from licking the plate my baked eggplant came on, and I swear my husband finished his whole plate of baked ziti in under 5 minutes. The service was quick and friendly. I'd come back here but probably more for a week night I don't want to cook and not for a special night out."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Oliva's several times now and enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere each time.  Last night I tried the Nohutlu Ispanek, a vegetarian entree with chickpeas, spinach, onions, carrots and celery cooked in a flavorful tomato sauce, served with rice and a yogurt sauce on the side.  It was outstanding!  Freshly prepared and delicious.  I also like Oliva's version of Imam Fainted.  Prices are very reasonable for the quality; portions are generous.  Entrees include a salad or soup."}
{"text":"This is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood! It is conveniently located close to the Sheppard/Yonge station. Their menu is reasonably priced - I came late one evening and the food was 50% off (but I don't think they offer this deal anymore). The best part is the spacious 2nd floor of the cafe. It is the perfect spot for studying - it's cozy, the background music is not too loud and the chairs are comfortable. I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. The lamb shank was the best we've had since visiting Paris in 2013. Even on a homecoming night, it was pleasantly quiet. The Mediterranean salad was very good. The two wines we tried were perfect. Our server, Rachel was friendly, gracious and efficient. We will return."}
{"text":"We ate there for the first time last weekend, the hubs ordered the lasagna and I had the stuffed eggplant.  We also shared an appetizer sampler- the oliva tapenade was wonderful, the Turkish bread is delish- warm and fresh. The stuffed eggplant was good, as was the lasagna; however, the lasagna was steaming, so it may have been microwaved.  Not that it's a felony to do so, but it was not expected. We shared baklava for dessert- unlike a previous reviewer's experience, ours was flaky and yummy.   Beer and wine only, so know before you go."}
{"text":"I ate here with a couple of friends on Saturday.  I mistakenly got the lamb shank instead of the kebabs, but it must have been some good karma, because that lamb was some of most tender and tasty that I have ever had, in a delicious and rich sauce.  My friend raved equally about the baked eggplant. My other friend had the tortellini, and really liked it, although she'd had better at restaurants with a primary focus on Italian.   The décor was quite nice and the owners and staff very friendly. Pricing was reasonable. Since Oliva is close to my home on the West Side, I will definitely be coming here often!"}
{"text":"Not good italian food. Chicken Parm seems to be frozen chicken patties. Same with the pre-breaded calamari."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see an independent coffee shop open up in the neighbourhood! I grabbed the chicken Caesar salad on my way to work one day -  really good! I've also tried the meatball wrap, which was quite good and huge! I'm not a coffee drinker, so I was a little disappointed to not see any tea lattes on the menu. There's a decent selection of tea - I wonder if they could make them iced?  Overall, it's a cute little place with nice staff and good vibes. Hopefully they will expand their drink and food selection in the future."}
{"text":"Well.... the hommus was ok and wine was nice. Everything else pretty bad I'll never go there again"}
{"text":"Very lovely people working there.  Food was fresh and delicious.  I had the Nohutlu Ispanak - - it was wonderful.  I hear the vegetable stew is also outstanding.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Had a very wonderful dinner here. They have lots of vegetarian entrées. I had the vegetable stew, hummus, grape leaves and the fresh bread. It was all completely delicious! I will definitely come back.   The service was very friendly and on top of things as well. We sat very close to the fireplace on a cold winters night in Madison, it was warn & toasty. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"I am constantly switching between a 3 and 4 star rating for this place. This is one of those times where I wish I could provide half a star.  Oliva is a cozy and casual restaurant on the west side of Madison catering to those who have a taste for Mediterranean or Italian food.  When walking into this place, you are welcomed to an open atmosphere with decor and colors that would be traditionally thought of as traditionally from the Mediterranean or Italy. A feature that I took particular liking to was the fireplace which was turned on, leading to a welcoming, home-loke environment.  Once seated we were greeted by a courteous wait staff who immediately brought water and fresh, warm Turkish bread. Our waitress was very attentive and had good timing. She also provided some insight with regards to what is popular on the menu. Overall the service was just fine, I have never come here and felt unwelcomed.  We decided on the shrimp artichoke, chicken kebabs, and gyros. All dishes came with a perfect serving of rice. We actually really liked this as often restaurants will just pile on the carbs and it can be tough to press on the brakes! All of the dishes, including meats, were perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The shrimp were large and was served in a rich, garlic cream sauce. The chicken was moist and tender. The gyro meat was not as rich as traditional gyro because it was a beef only recipe - big bummer in my opinion.  I think while everything was satisfactory, one thing that took away was the variety of food. They do it all well, but, as often said, the jack of all trades is king of none.    Overall, reasonable prices, good service, good food, good date spot."}
{"text":"I was in Madison for work, I wanted to find some mediterranean food. I am so glad I found this place. I was here like 6-7 times during my stay. Everything I tried tasted great.  I had a chance to meet the owner. He was welcoming, very friendly chef with 20 years of experience. He makes sure the customers are satisfied with their food. I would recommend this place for everyone who wants great taste of Italian, Greek, and Turkish food."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like Oliva because our server was so friendly but there are many fundamental flaws with this restaurant: first of all it took well over an hour for our entrees to arrive, 3 out of 4 dishes were lukewarm at best. We started with the hummus appetizer which, though we ordered it as soon as we sat down, arrived AFTER our soup course, approx 30 mins after ordering it. The soup was not hot .... how can a soup not be hot?? Just turn the stock pot on! Salads were dull. But to wait an hour for the food to arrive only to have it tepid at best was unforgivable. We will not return"}
{"text":"When you're in the need for cheesy comfort food, you can't beat the pasta dishes here. Unpretentious and quality food. Just like what your family would make."}
{"text":"We went to Oliva last Friday night.   I had salmon baked in grape leaves, which was one of the specials, and my husband had the gyros plate which was a deconstructed gyros.  We both thought our meals were excellent.  I also had lentil soup which was the soup of the day and very good.  My husband had the house salad which he said was good, but pretty standard.  We also enjoyed the freshly baked Turkish bread that came with the meal.  We received excellent service from our waiter, Tanner. We will definitely return!."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for dinner! Arrived here with a party of 3 and wait wasn't too bad, perhaps 30 minutes. There was a great couch and fireplace to sit and wait!  The lambrosa wine from Italy is nice and bubbly! Very fruity like a fruit juice!   Bread was amazing! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! Olive oil was great!  Fried calamari was alright.  Chicken kebab was great! Grilled to awesome flavor but was a little dry for my taste.  Imam Fainted. eggplant with pine nuts! The sauce was basically tomato, but if you're a vegetarian fan, this is great!  Lasagna was great! Light and cheesy.  Side note: the waiter misunderstood our order and kindly offered to replace our dish. When we refused as there would be another 15 minutes wait, he was so thoughtful and sent us a chocolate hazelnut cake!  I'm not sure if I would be back although the food was great. But there are other places in town for more authentic mediterranean (greek) and italian food."}
{"text":"We come here every now and again and consistently have a decent meal. The service has been good each time, and there are a few standbys we know we can order that will be pretty good, like the red lentil soup and the falafel. I don't have a crazy experience list to compare their falafel to, but it's better than anything I have done at home and better than Bunky's (for the locals) in my opinion. Tonight we added olive tapenade to the appetizer line up, which was ok, nothing outstanding - seemed like mainly basic black and green olives stood out. I have previously ordered the chicken kebabs which I've always enjoyed but tonight I went with the vegetarian Nohutlu Ispanak. Both this and the beef kebabs, ordered by my husband, were simply under-seasoned, but again - decent and certainly not bad. I did add the rest of the olive tapenade to my dish and it definitely gave it a little more depth.  The kids can easily find something to eat here and this restaurant has always been welcoming to the family table. I'd like to see them take it up a notch with their food but I'm sure I'll be back regardless as sometimes you just can't put a price on consistency."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here! Cute restaurant with good food! We started with appetizers- cigar borek (delicious cheesy pastry appetizer- kind of like a Turkish mozarella stick... Except with feta cheese and better), baba ganush (very good), and the Shepherd salad (yummy and refreshing).   For dinner, we got an array of things. We unanimously decided the stuffed eggplant (karniyarik) was the best entree. Chicken shish kebab was good, but would have been disappointed by serving size if we did not get appetizers.   Overall, very nice and fresh tasting meal, with lots of yummy Turkish options. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really REAL Turkish food: So thrilled my husband found Oliva, not far from our hotel on the edge of Madison right after we arrived. We were even more thrilled to find the excellent quality and true Turkish food, reminiscent of being in Turkey - starting with the glass of Cankaya white wine (from near where I used to live in Ankara, Turkey) through the kofte and sis kebabs, the Turkish lamb special and the karniyarik, and the baklava - made with yufka not phyllo dough - and not cloyingly sweet as most US baklava is. It was great to be able to speak Turkish with the owners, Yucenur and Mehmet and others in the kitchen. It was so delicious, we went back the next night!! I didn't have enough room or time to eat all the Turkish treats offered on the menu, especially the ones I cannot make for myself!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best calzone I've had in the Madison area. It was a nice atmosphere and there vice was great. My wife had the gyro platter which was also delicious.  If you're in the mood for some good food from the Mediterranean area, this is a great place."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food!  My Gyro plate was super and the pizza was very good and the lamb kebab was memorable: rare and tender.  Overall very happy."}
{"text":"I may have gives it a five I was so impressed.  I have never given a five.  The staff was friendly and attentive.   The portions were generous.  My wife had the chicken shikabab and said it was excellent.  I had a calzone and it was well done.  The baklava was light and very well done.  The rice pudding may have been the best I have eaten. We have bookmarked it and will be back when in Madison."}
{"text":"I had the calzone, it was a fantastic because the crust was not thick and it was crunchy- so it gave a beautiful tasty to the vegetable filling. I had one with spinach, artichoke, mushroom, and tomatoes.  The side sauce was fabulous, and I was able to get more - I'm love sauce with my calzone.  The server was fantastic and informed me that all vegetables are as fresh as can be and it tasted it as such."}
{"text":"We come here often and I've tried just about everything on the menu. The hot bread the comes out must be tried with a plate of their homemade hummus. The beef kebabs are always done right, and any of the salads are crisp and fresh, we usually get the Shepherd's salad, which is cucumber, tomato, feta cheese and olives. The Calzones and pizza are very good with a light crisp crust on the pizza. The Calzones are a decent size and could be shared. Try some Turkish tea with your meal, and some baklava for dessert. Service is usually very prompt and courteous as well."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with an Americano and a brioche egg bacon and cheese sandwich which was really good. The brioche bun was fresh, crispy bacon and lots of egg. The coffee is made using an industrial sized Nespresso machine, which is good for decently strong and consistent coffee beverages but don't expect any artisanal coffee drinks here with latte art. I'd come here for breakfast over SB or Tim Hortons just for that sandwich. I ate it too fast and didn't take a photo."}
{"text":"Healthier alternative to all the other stuff around.  Had the meatball wrap. Pretty good size"}
{"text":"It was interesting to see both Mediterranean and Italian offerings at Oliva.  I'm not sure if specializing in two ethnic foods was necessarily a good idea because both sides were just average. The deluxe pizza was good as it's hard to mess up pizza in my eyes (I'm a pizza lover). The gyro platter was okay, but I've definitely had better and definitely for cheaper as well. I probably liked the stuffed eggplant the most. As for dessert, the baklava wasn't bad.  I've only been here once because like I mentioned, you can get both better Mediterranean and better Italian food elsewhere. Nonetheless, if you and a friend want to get dinner together and can't decide on one or the other, then that would be a call for Oliva."}
{"text":"This is, sadly, a boring Sysco-based restaurant. It's not offensive, but I won't go there again. It's just not all that interesting.  I think you're better off at Bunky's."}
{"text":"I've been going to Oliva for a while. Not a regular but go in every once in a while, a few times a year. I find the mediterranean options good but aren't my favorite. The dining experience is very professional and relaxing. A lot of people had negative experiences with the servers being rude I see but I have not found that personally."}
{"text":"The Avondale neighbourhood needed something like Oliva. I was getting tired of going to the Starbucks and battling students for a seat for a ten minute coffee break.   I dropped by a couple of times mostly for quick coffee/ tea, and they are pretty average. But I really like that they have a variety of pre-packaged food options that you can pick up on your way to work - and they seem fresh!   The upstairs area is spacious and a great spot to get work done or study, whereas the downstairs seems to be a bit more social. The staff were polite and very quick with service. I am very excited to see the direction it takes in the next little while. It definitely has the potential to be the \"Neighbourhood Cafe\"."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place because of the atmosphere, great coffee and food and amazing upstairs area to study and get work done."}
{"text":"The exterior caught my attention and the interior reminds me of one of those higher end fast food HK Cafe inside Times Square.   Basically there's a section where you get your hot items. I chose the mushroom with Swiss cheese. It wasn't hot enough so I asked if the staff can reheat it, they said the stove will melt my bun. Anyways, the egg was way over cooked. I thought starbucks breakfast was bad, but this one beats the quality of how dry the eggs are. The tea was mediocre.  This is more like a 2.5 star. Not sure if I will come back again."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for lunch a few days ago. It is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking there and across the street. The inside of this establishment is cozy and clean with nice Mediterranean decor. A bit unique as the menu is mostly Italian but has a wide variety of Greek and Turkish selections as well. The service is very good.  They bring out a basket of bread and there is olive oil and cheese on the table to enjoy it with. The bread is very good and not like many of the run of the mill mass produced garbage you get in many places. This is important to me for this type of cuisine. Everybody in my party went with lagnasa which they said was very good. I tried an appetizer called Cigar Borek which is a feta cheese filled pastry tube of delicious. I had the lamb kabobs which came with a side of rice that was spiced with what I believe were pine nuts. Also included is a small salad on the plate itself. The meat is cooked to order and it was very lean and tender. The dish was not large but I enjoyed t very much and it was enough. I would definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food. Fresh and Tasty. Reasonably priced and wonderful waitstaff! We've been 3 times in the last month and we have not been disappointed. The stuffed grape leaves and the baba ganoush were wonderful."}
{"text":"Nope. Not liking this place. I've gone there 3 times just to make sure. Mostly bc we live around the corner and also bc we thought it just might have been the dishes i ordered, or the day of the week...blah, blah, blah. Nope, it really is just that the food isn't really that good or tasty.On the Italian side of the menu, the food was bland. No real depth of flavor. On the mediterian side, The falafel was mushy and tasteless. Not a typical falafel -which I don't mind creativity in presentation, but it has to taste good. Event kids didn't like their kids selection. 3 times a charm for me."}
{"text":"Our server stole from us.  He felt he deserved additional tip and added $10 to the bill after we left. We needed to contact the bank to cancel payment. Also, he was inattentive even though we were the only ones in his section.   Food was very oily, basically oozed out of my vegetarian plate. Took it home and had to use 5 paper towels to soak up the excess oil. Ordered tea and got a single 6/8 oz glass instead of a pot. Dessert portions were a bit on the small side (3 triangles of baklava) and did not taste much better than store bought.   We won't be back.  Update: Talked to the owner/manager about the theft. He was aware of it and had talked to the bank on his end. Unfortunately he said that he would talk to the server about this, which was appalling to me as now knowingly employing someone who steals from their customers.  If you do decide to dine here, pay in cash or verify that your card isn't being overcharged. I likely wasn't the first person server #53 stole from, and I probably won't be the last."}
{"text":"I had the Imam Fainted entree for dinner.  That and the lentil soup were very tasty."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant and go every time we are visiting Madison! This time we had the stuffed grape leaves, Mediterranean salad with shrimp, and eggplant parm! Delicious!"}
{"text":"The best word I have to describe Oliva is meh. That pretty much covers it. Meh. The decor, the food, the service was just meh.  We decided to drive across town to try Oliva. My husband was craving Mediterranean and there unfortunately aren't many moderately priced good Mediterranean restaurants in this town. (Someone please remedy this ASAP). But I see they served Italian as well so why not.   We got seated right away and our waitress was very sweet and new in her job.  We ended up ordering some wine. I'm always curious to see what kind of pours restaurants give you. I had the same wine for the same price at a different location last weekend and the pours were vastly different. Oliva was definitely on the weak side. I despise cheap wine pours.   Then our waitress brought us the only highlight of the entire experience...the bread. It was light and warm and great with olive oil. I ordered the cannelloni and my husband, who had planned to order the beef shish kebab changed his mind and ordered the special of a lamb shank. We both opted for the red lentil soup instead of salad because we are suckers for a great lentil soup. When it arrived, well let's just call it the Tale of Two Soups. My soup was all liquid with a scant amount of lentils on the bottom. I assumed this was the soup. I didn't see my husband's because a water glass was in the way. He happened to notice what I was eating and was shocked. He moved the glass and showed me his soup. It was completely different. Thick and loaded with lentils. Side by side they looked like completely different soups.   Because we had to wait so long for the soup and wine we figured dinner would be awhile. But to our surprise, our dinner arrived within 3 minutes of us getting our soup. That immediately said to me....microwaved.  Yep...the plate and food was screaming hot. Even at home, you know you don't get food like that unless it was microwaved. My cannelloni was rubbery with filling that was flavorless and tomato sauce that was too sweet. My husband's lamb shank was better with really tender meat but it severely lacked salt. He wished he would have stuck with his original decision of the kebabs.   Too bad over all. We like to try new restaurants but the food and decor seemed soulless. I think it they would concentrate more on the Turkish side of the menu, it would actually work.  I was really hoping this restaurant would deliver but sadly it didn't."}
{"text":"This cute little place opened up on Yonge, just south of the P&G building. The structure itself used to be a condo showhome that has since renovated and has enough seating space for a cozy café   We arrived thinking it was a brunch place (owners, can you pls consider this? ) but found out it was a café with sandwiches, pastries and coffees   Their prices are around the $3-$6 mark and are excellent. Attention to detail is spot on as they had both stevia and lactose free milk to add in your coffee.   Will be back in the near future to sit down and enjoy a cup of joe on their patio. It's a good alternative to the Starbucks in the area  This is a good spot to have a chat with your friends, or to do some work. I believe they have an upstairs in addition to their patio."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I visited Oliva last friday. We ordered a few appetizers. I think Baba Ganoush, Kalamari and Charman. Kalamari was a little bland but the other two were great and very flavorful.   I ordered the Beef Kebab and we shared a chocolate cheesecake, both of these dishes were delicious. We had a great time, our waitstaff was gracious and attentive. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant. The food is pretty good and the service is ok as well. You walk into a warm inviting restaurant with a beautiful fireplace in the middle. It is usually fairly busy so calling ahead to make a reservation is a good option. Our waitress was very nice and the service was ok all around. The bread is amazing that they bring you before your meal! It is fresh, crunchy yet soft and the olive oil to go with it is also amazing. Our food came out and it was pretty good. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan. The eggplant was a little underdone but it was still good. The red lentil soup is to die for, it's really delicious, the pepper in it is my favorite spice. Overall a pretty good restaurant. I recommend it for larger groups as you can share appetizers for the whole table. The hummus plates, falafel plates and a lot of other great options to share."}
{"text":"I think this place has been open only a week or two but since its close to my work, I have tried it 3 times. I felt good as soon as I walked in since its very clean and looks nice and new. I have tried one of their parfait, their tuna salad sandwitch and greek salad. All 3 were really good and tasty. I totally felt good for the price that I paid. Prices are much cheaper than their naighbor starbucks and the options are way more than what you can find there. Staff were nice and friendly too. I hope they keep up the good work and dont go anywhere."}
{"text":"Oliva is fantastic! As soon as your order is in the server will bring a basket of fresh baked bread to the table. The bread itself is rather unique in that it is both toasty and crispy and soft and chewy at the same time. The servers will keep the baskets of bread coming until your food arrives. As far as the food goes if you like stick to your ribs home cooking and Italian/Mediterranean flavors this is the place for you. I've tried their falafel appetizer, calzone, pizza, and chicken fettuccine. I have yet to be disappointed. Also the baklava is heaven! Perfect balance of pastry, filing, and honey!"}
{"text":"Awesome new addition to the neighborhood. Great food, super friendly staff, very well priced and over all a great atmosphere to grab a coffee on the go, have breakfast or lunch, or  pastries to sit and enjoy. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After a series of disappointments at restaurants stretching from here to Montana I am happy to say we finally scored some very good food at Oliva!   Not only was the food good but the atmosphere was very nice,  the settings were elegant and clean and the service was very good. We began with a serving of four slices of delicious bread that I thought he said it was pita bread.  It was light and flavorful.   We ordered two more later in the meal all complements of the house. I had an eggplant dish with pine nuts called The Imam Fainted.  It was served hot with rice and of ample proportion and full of flavor.  My companion ordered the Vegetable Stew which was equally delicious.   For desert we had the Tiramisu which was well made and very good but didn't wow me. The view outside isn't anything that spectacular.  But inside the decorations are fitting with a Mediterranean restaurant and the music was also fitting and at a perfect volume.  This is certainly a restaurant we will be back to soon."}
{"text":"Pretty standard coffee, but a great venue. We spent a rainy afternoon studying at Oliva, which is surprisingly spacious with plenty of seating on two levels. It never got too busy despite it being a Saturday. Music was pretty similar to what I usually listen to, and suitable for focusing. The a/c seemed to be on when we first arrived even though it's mid-fall, but they turned up the temperature once someone complained.   Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for an open, moderately quiet study space.   P.S. there's a few parking spots behind the building reserved for Oliva customers (didn't see these and parked about five minutes away - got soaked on the way back to the car)"}
{"text":"First time visit of this place. Was very impressed by the friendly staffs who actively provided helps when I walk in with crutches.   During my time working in here, a staff came to me with a medium size coffee & asked me to give it a try. She explained that i have two Starbucks cup on my table (b/c I used the travel mugs to fill in coffee & water here). So her manager want me to try their coffee & have a taste of it. Honestly, i would expect a question, or even a request for me to buy stuff here, when they have this question in their mind. Instead they gave out a coffee for free, maybe believing that I will like their coffee more than Starbucks. This gesture makes me feel warmly welcome, & I am really impressed by that.   I had their organic coffee, a California sandwich, & an almond croissant. The sandwich is fresh with decent price, & the croissant tastes alright. The organic coffee matches Second Cup or Timothy, but not as outstanding comparing to the real espresso bar or local rooster & coffee bar. With their price ($1.99) & under a great competition with a Starbucks nearby, I would expect their coffee can be a little better.   Anyhow, still had a good experience here. A place where I can work, dine, & to chill with a cup of coffee. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great middle eastern and Italian restaurant with Turkish flares and delicious appetizers soups and entrees to choose from. Greatest I've found of this cuisine in Madison so far. Flexible carry out and nice dine in options."}
{"text":"Oliva is hit or miss.   The customer service has been amazing. Whether I'm with my partner, with my family, alone or with my kiddos. I have never been approached rudely, or had any negative interactions at Oliva.  The calamari was a little underdone, breading a bit raw still.   The grape leaves weren't my favorite. (I've had a few different styles.)  The hummus platter was wonderful.  The pizzas were delightful.  Overall I would say yes for service. If I find my bills and recall other entrées I've had I will adjust this review to show them. I'll write reviews sooner in future!"}
{"text":"I think what impressed me the most with Oliva was the ambiance and the menu. I believe it's the first time I have seen a hybrid of Mediterranean and Italian, redundant as that may sound. And a large comfortable, classy dining area which might imply a more pricey menu. Yet, the extensive menu choices are all at a price point one can swallow. Pastas where pastas should be-around $8-9.00. appetizers between $5-10.00. Sandwiches and salads and some middle Eastern Kebab dinners And a variety of choices which made me think I need to try them all.   We were in the mood for a light lunch. My companion had the Mediterranean Salad and I chose a small Shepherd's salad and a plate of stuffed grape leaves. While the latter were a little over-salted, they were full of flavor. The salads was fresh, visually appealing, and just right for a small serving. The number of appetizers and small plates really allow for tapas style eating here. The Italian entrees which I observed on other tables were pretty substantial and would fill the average eater. Don't look for \"big food\" though, because portions are more on the European side.  Our server was quiet and even a bit retreating in her approach, but she didn't fail to keep our fresh bread basket or water glasses full. I like the 0ffering of dipping oil, parmesan and fresh bread. Our meals were delivered in a timely manner. I can recommend Oliva if you're looking for a quiet, unhurried lunch where you can catch up with a friend or family member."}
{"text":"I love this place because I like hummus and Mediterranean food. I went here once for a birthday party. We had a good time. The complaints were: Food took too long (they were busy and had just opened), very cold draft blowing in from the front door (wear knee socks!), lighting too bright and they need to use glasses instead of plastic cups. I'm not too wild about the kind of bread they serve as an appetizer, but my date loved it. Olive oil for dipping is plentiful and good quality. The little dinner salad was a bit skimpy. Overall the food is fresh and well presented. When they are busy the restaurant has a warm atmosphere with help from the fireplace and the buzz of the patrons. The wine is good and reasonably priced as is the menu. The tiramisu is fabulous! They are locally owned and operated, the wait staff is very nice and attentive. Located off Old Sauk, next to the Alicia Ashman library across from Dean Care in the old Atlanta Bread Co. location. They outgrew the Grape & Co. location next door. 5 stars as there are not a whole lot of restaurants to choose from on the west side. If they could just tone down that lighting a few notches..."}
{"text":"Loved the fresh food and the pleasant athmosphere!"}
{"text":"This restaurant microwaves all the dishes in plastic wrap which has been known to cause cancer. I would stay away. The owners also do not like Americans, just Turkish people."}
{"text":"This is one of the best middle eastern cuisine I've had - i like everything here - baba ganouch, kababs, gyro, hummus.... my favorite thing is their freshly baked bread that they serve with the dinner.... I loved their sangria as well..... the atmosphere is quite and cosy.... really nice place to have a peaceful dinner with friends and family....."}
{"text":"The lentil soup was good, although lentil soup in general is hard to mess up. I want to be very clear about the falafel, however. It was flat out awful. Didn't try the hummus. The bread was okay. The baklava was unfortunately very soggy, not very good at all. On th bright side, they let us stay til 11pm and we weren't the only ones there, the place has a good atmosphere and nice, attentive waitstaff. I wouldn't come here again for mediterranean food. Lastly, my gf had the stuffed eggplant and she said it was ok--the rice pilaf was cooked well but needed more almonds. The eggplant was nothing special."}
{"text":"Quality: 4.5/5 Service: 3/5 (it's self-serve) Price: 4/5  California club sandwich was really good. the ingredients here are very fresh and reasonably priced. if you are looking for fast food speed but healthy option of a restaurant style branch, this is your place.   breakfast options include various sandwiches, drinks and baked goods + soups. I would say the soups are not worth it (had the lobster cream of soup), it didn't have any lobster and didn't really have the seafood soup taste, just creamy taste. felt like i was just drinking thick cream.  because everything is made fresh, popular items will run out if you go there late. it's pick up + go style. you don't order what you want for food items. you order your drinks.  tip: they have more seating area upstairs and they have free WIFI"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with my mother-in-law.  The decor was nice and the service was pretty good, but a little slow considering the restaurant wasn't that crowded.  The turkish bread that they keep refilling was delicious.    I got the Mediterranean salad with falafel and it was delicious.  The homemade dressing had a very tasty flavor.  The falafel was crispy, had a good taste, but I've had better falafels.    My mother-in-law got the veggie stew.  I didn't try it, but she said it was flavorful and the portion size was good.    Overall, we enjoyed this restaurant and it was worth the price.  I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"While Turkish food in Madison is not the exotic oddity it used to be, it can be a welcome change from the regular options to local diners.  I remembered that they had a weekend salmon special wrapped in grape leaves with a green citrus sauce, along with a small salad and nice serving of saffron rice.  It did not disappoint, although the price led me to believe that it was likely farm raised.  On this occasion, not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch yesterday without looking at the menu or reading reviews first - something I rarely do.  We were immediately greeted and sat.  The decor is interesting - seems to have a lot of different \"areas\" within the large space.  The kitchen was sort of open so you could see the chef but not necessarily what he was doing.  There was only one waitress but it really wasn't busy at all.  She brought us waters right away and continued to be seen until we were ready to order.  I was torn between two dishes and she helped me choose, which is always appreciated.  The worst thing to hear is \"I haven't tried that before\" or \"I'm not really sure\".    We were given bread and my friend requested their house dressing to dip it in.  She has been here several times and insisted I try.  She made a comment that she'd wished she ordered a salad too just so she could have more of the dressing. The food came quickly and was absolutely delicious.  I had canneloni which was hard to stop eating.  The portion size was perfect - could've saved half if I had ordered a side salad.    I over-heard the waitress speaking to the table next to us at one point.  She apologized that there was a delay in their food and that it was her fault and not the kitchen's.  I thought she handled the situation with tact; assuming responsibility and then offering up some free dessert.  Sometimes it's just easier to blame it on the kitchen and I liked that she was honest.    I will definitely be back.  My friend highly suggested the Gyro plate - which, by the way, is made of beef - not lamb like she had thought =)"}
{"text":"I'm a bit confused by the hype surrounding all the Oliva spots that are popping up. My wife got their coffee and it was nothing special (isn't it just Nespresso?) and I got their cocoa and it was overly, sickeningly sweet. No idea about the food but based off these 2 items and how much they cost, I'd much rather go to the nearby Starbucks or Tim's.  That said, the location is awesome. It reminded me a bit about how Starbucks used to be. Not in terms of any fancy/trendy decor or comfortable couches. But more about it being a quiet place you could stay at for hours on end. Spent half a Sunday there working on my laptop and felt completely at ease and in the zone because of the great space on Oliva's second floor: good spacing between tables, comfortable-enough seating, and not-excessively-loud noise levels.  2 stars for the coffee/cocoa, 4 stars for the space."}
{"text":"Really not an Italian restaurant. Had a sampling of appetizers, liked the baba ganush, falafel was pretty good, everything else pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick team lunch. The concept reminds me of Pret-a-Manger in the UK with a selection of sandwiches, salads and hot items on one side and drinks and desserts on the other. The space is bright, open and inviting. With all the condos and office buildings in the area, I'm sure it will be a welcome destination.   I shared the chicken ceasar and hot meatball wrap. The ceasar was a decent size for a light lunch with plenty of cheese. The meatball wrap could have been saucier, but I get that they don't want to have a soggy mess. It might be nice to have sauce on the side for dipping. The prices are in line with other fresh options available in the area. There was a turkey wrap with avocado and cilantro dressing that sounded amazing, so I'll be back. They also have a nice size patio, so that'll be nice during the warmer mouths."}
{"text":"Not impressed by pre made food kept hot or cold on shelves. They make nothing to order and customized. It's a glorified cafeteria basically."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious.  When we arrived, we were seated quickly and the waitress was very friendly and quick. We started our dinner with the house soup of red lentil soup and that was just delicious. Good balance of flavors and not too heavy on the lentils. We then had our appetizers of the Appetizers Combo (Humus, Kisir, Chaman, and Tapenade) and Garlic Bread. The garlic bread was wonderful. I wasn't thrilled with the texture of the Kisir, the humus was a tad on the bland side for me, the tapenade was a tad salty. My favorite was the Chaman. However, my husband and our friend enjoyed each spread, so it's likely my taste buds are just off.   For our entrees, my husband chose the Imam Fainted and enjoyed that very much. I decided to start with Shepherd Salad because I was craving a salad and that was a good idea. The salad very well done - the veggies were a good balance of each vegetable and the dressing light and refreshing. I also chose the Falafel entree and that was, again, delicious. Our friend had the gyro combo and enjoyed that very much considering it was her first time having that. The rice that accompanied each of the entrees was yummy...and I'm not a big fan of rice.  For dessert, we had baklava and that was just amazing. It wasn't too crunchy and wasn't too sweet.  One thing to note: the portions were huge. (And we also ordered way too much but we didn't realize that the appetizers would be portioned as big as they were. We got full off the red lentil soup and the appetizers themselves).   Our waitress was super sweet and prompt. Wish I could her name to give her proper kudos. Oh well. But we'll be coming back here !"}
{"text":"Nice decent cafe at Yonge near Shepperd. It a good place for a quick bite or if you are looking for cheap options but healthy. They have a decent patio. They make fresh sandwiches and salads. Service is good. They do have some good vegetarian options. Coffee is fine too.   It more like a breakfast or quick lunch bite rather than a sit-down place. But the good thing is they have some parking space at the back."}
{"text":"They have the best bread. Unfortunately for the Madison food scene, this is the only restaurant that i've visited (and I've been around) whose bread is smoking when you tear it apart. It's light, aromatic, crips on the crust and pillowy on the inside. A basket (or two) of this bread with olive oil, accompanied by a cup of their tomato based lentil soup, and you're on your way to lunch heaven.  Other favorites are the puff pastry appetizer, kebobs, and artichoke shrimp with rice. That last one is a dinner item, they will serve it at lunch upon request.   I also love the decor. Excuse my ignorance, but it seems very Turkish (please correct me if I'm wrong). It's elaborate but unpretentious, romantic but personable. A befitting ambiance for any occasion."}
{"text":"Great ethnic appetizers on this menu.  For a place that is Mediterranean and Italian, I would consider this place just your average Italian restaurant judging the entrees.  One page of the menu is dedicated to Pizza and another to Calzones.  If you are looking for someplace with a variety of ethnic choices, I would not recommend this place.  Atmosphere and service excellent."}
{"text":"Being in a strip mall, it's not a place that many people consider, but it has very good food at a very reasonable price. I recommend the Gyro Doner or the Eggplant Parm, both are excellent. They have good pizza as well, which is very popular with our 5 year old.  My only complaint is that they don't have a full bar, just wine and beer, and their selection is pretty limited. But again, very good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is a nice new addition to the neighbourhood. I think there are some points which can use feedback but overall a great first experience.   We were greeted warmly when we walked in, the people working there are young and enthusiastic. There were only a few people actually in the shop though and it seemed like there were a lot of people working for whatever reason. The food is all pre-made which I think is good for a quick stop but that means customizing your sandwich or salad isn't an option here.   We tried a chicken bacon sandwich, the lobster bisque soup and a spinach salad that came with goats cheese and a bunch of fruits. The food was priced fairly, everything was around $5 to under $10. The salad was priced a bit high in my opinion at just under $8 which I wouldn't normally mind, but the container was somewhat under-filled so I didn't think the value was quite there but it did taste fresh and there was a generous amount of cheese and fresh fruit. The soup was actually pretty delicious. Rich and creamy and it had bits of lobster. For around $4.50, I can't really ask for more, maybe that the cup was filled a bit more, it was around 2/3 full which was a bit surprising when I opened the lid. The sandwich was pretty good too, big chunks of chicken and bacon. I'm not a big fan of prepackaged sandwiches just because you don't know how fresh they are but this one wasn't bad, the bread was a bit soggy though but for the price, it's good value.   They also offer some other hot dishes like pasta and Mac and cheese, they have some breakfast options like oatmeal and fruit bowls and a bunch of other nice stuff at a reasonable price. Their espresso offerings, like other people mentioned, are brewed from a commercial nespresso machine which, for people like me that have a nespresso machine at home, isn't overly impressive, and I likely won't be ordering coffee drinks from here because of that. We did order a hazelnut iced latte though which was good. I think they should have gone with something more unique like a local coffee company rather than nespresso.   The space is nice and bright, I assume they're anticipating lineups because other than the bar around the perimeter of the cafe, there isn't anywhere to sit. It's just a big open space in the middle but there is a nice patio outside. Not sure if that's going to change once winter comes.   The cafe is brand new and super clean, the food is all really attractive looking and the prices are good. I'll definitely come back for the soup and maybe try a breakfast option or quinoa bowl!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a smallish strip mall next door to a Peruvian restaurant (the picture of the restaurant here is actually its former location, where the Peruvian place now is), Oliva's mix of Italian and Turkish cuisine is somewhat unexpected, but it's a good place for groups because almost everyone can find something.  When you sit down, you get a small basket of Turkish bread, which isn't like pita bread but more like squares of puffy, light foccaccia. We ordered the appetizer combo ($14), which included hummus, olive tapenade, Carrot Delight, and a slightly spicy red pepper dip. For entrees, our group was evenly split between Turkish and Mediterranean. I loved my beef shish kebab, especially the flavorful rice, which sort of reminded me of dim sum sticky rice. The yogurt sauce was envied by my calzone-ordering tablemates, although they were very happy with their giant calzones. The house salad comes with a tangy lemony vinaigrette that's really good and worth trying.  We came in fairly late, an hour before closing, when there was only one other table. Soon we were the only table, and from then on we were kind of obsessively stalked by our server, who was popping in every two minutes to refill the bread, ask if we needed anything else at all, and generally hurry us out the door. I didn't care for that part so much - if you're open till 9, you're open till 9. Quit bugging us about the damn bread.  In addition to the shish kebab and some veggie Turkish dishes, there's also a sprinkling of traditional pasta dishes, a few salads, and individual pizzas. Prices ranged from $12-16 for dinner entrees, and it looked like they also did some pizza delivery or takeout at the counter. The vibe is casual and friendly and overall I enjoyed it... that server just needs to chill out a little."}
{"text":"Dude. Oliva's is good.   I really love their red lentil soup. I've had the chicken and lamb shish kebab and both are delicious - well seasoned and cooked perfectly - not dry at all. Loving eggplant, I'm really tempted to try the Imam fainted, but i enjoy so much the kebabs, i have yet to do it.    It is nice that Oliva's offers a little for everyone. The service has always been good, too."}
{"text":"Wow!! This used to be a favorite.. What happened? Host rude.. Waitress worse.. She came alive & complained about staffing problems when it came time to tip! Portions scanty & special order made incorrectly.. With no apology.. Too bad.. Our last visit.."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The decor and seats are so welcoming, and well designed. The seats are so comfortable and the tables are very nice. They have a patio and seating area upstairs all very spacious. The food tastes very fresh and clean. Prices are very reasonable and portions are very filling. The staff were welcoming and I would definitely come back again! They had some very interesting cleansing juices, sandwiches, pastas, soups, yogurt mixes, oatmeal mixes and baked goods with coffee. I had the mushroom onion soup and it was very good and not pricey ($4 something). It wasn't very salty and tasted very rich in mushroom and onion. The apple craisin almond yogurt was fresh and filling and around $3 something which was very reasonable! Everything about this place screams young fancy convenient but without the outrageous price!"}
{"text":"Best gyro sandwich i've ever had; perfectly balanced (Have tried many different gyros while living in different cities over the years). The crusty bread rather than pita is unusual (given their concept it makes sense), but adds a nice texture to a dish that can sometimes go a bit soggy. Service was great, very pleasant & attentive. Great value for money as well. The red lentil soup was fantastic too. Definitely will come back & check out other dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place. We eat here often and have never had a bad meal. Service is attentive and friendly. I had the lamb kabobs this time and they were cooked perfectly to my order. Companion had the spaghetti and meatballs and was very happy with his order. Unfortunately, the bread is delicious and I ate too much and was stuffed after finishing my meal."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious coffee, and an excellent selection of fresh sandwiches / wraps.  Remember to check out the upstairs area!"}
{"text":"Love their fresh organic coffee always go with my friend When we are in the area. Bye Starbucks"}
{"text":"I ordered the falafel entree for lunch ($9) & water to drink.  Tasty meal overall, & fillling enough for a warm midday meal. Good service too. This is the first restaurant in the area I've encountered that offers Turkish döner."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance , good service very disappointing food. We ordered calamari and received pre-frozen uniform cut pieces which were NOT calamari. Some derivative of pollock. Fishy tasting. We also ordered a soup with our meal. Pepper lentil soup. Not much to write home about. Then the worst of the night. Eggplant parmesan which was not baked, but sliced and breaded then deep fried with canned tomato purée. Flavorless. Spaghetti was over cooked and flavorless.   We also ordered a gyro. No pita bread offered or available. Pre-cut frozen gyro. Uniformity of cuts of gyro meat indicates pre-made product.  All this mediocrity for $50.00. Appalling.  I saw many people at this restaurant and the majority ordered the individual pizzas.   Very disappointed and I will never go back. A bad date night meal"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal.  Easygoing relaxed atmosphere with fantastic food.  The falafel was the best I've had in many years;  it was light and crisp.  My husband had the fettuccine Alfredo, fabulous!  The server was friendly and attentive.  We dined with our 7 and 1 year old comfortably in one part while adult friends dined comfortably away from our domesticity.  The children loved their food, too.  Great baklava as well."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend out to dinner tonight. There weren't that many people so I figured service would be terrific and the food fast as we were starving. Boy was I wrong. The server took forever to bring our drinks Bc she kept answering the phone and taking carry out orders. This should have been handled from the host or a server that wasn't busy. I ordered the large med salad and got a small yet she charged me for 2 small salads which was $4 over the large salad price. The calamari was delicious. My boyfriend ordered shrimp Alfredo and got something completely different and was served with rice. We thought it was odd that pasta would come with rice and then we realized it was the wrong order. He is too polite to send it back. Took forever to find the server to ask for water. That is so annoying when you're out of water. The dressing on the med salad is delicious but I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 stars because of the hot chocolate I ordered, it tasted water-downed and really had no flavour profile. But because quiet and clean working spaces are far and few between, I do hope that it sticks around and stay that way.   I can't comment on the food but I hope they improve their beverages. My boyfriend ordered the cappuccino and it was lacking in taste and pretty average. We love the upstairs space, it was spacious enough to not feel cramped with other people and felt like we had our personal space. It would be nice if there were more outlets for the tables just hovering in the middle and if there was an area to charge phones."}
{"text":"Only giving 3 stars because I ordered a small take out and am not able to comment on service or a wide variety of food.  The atmosphere was nice upon entering, lots of cute booths and a fire place in the middle. I ordered baba ganoush and the grape leaves. The gapes leaves with a yogurt sauce. They were pretty good and you got 5 in an order which seemed substantial. The yogurt sauce though was a little bland for my taste. The baba ganoush was pretty good as well. It had a slight kick from a ton of garlic, which I didnt mind. However, I did not get any bread, veggies or anything for dipping with for the baba ganoush. I'm guessing they just forgot? I would hope so because for $6 the portion was not as much as I would have hoped for to begin with plus no bread was kinda of a turn off. I will probably come back to try other things maybe dine in. As the flavor of everything was pretty good."}
{"text":"First of all, throw away your preconceived ideas of what eggplant is like. Then go to Oliva and order \"The Imam Fainted\", their baked eggplant dish. They must bake the slices of eggplant for hours ahead of time, until it becomes a nutty, buttery substance that melts in your mouth. They then finish it in the oven with onions, peppers, and pine nuts, and what seems like a coulis of sun-dried tomatoes with it. The final glorious touch is the rice pilaf, which contains the most buttery perfect rice I have eaten in years. My guy had the beef kebabs, which were marinated in a complex but subtle blend of spices then perfectly grilled, and accompanied by the great rice pilaf. Although he is a committed meat eater, he loved my eggplant enough that I think he'll order it next time. Along with the meal they serve a soft, toasted turkish bread that is nothing like a pita. We got some humus to have with it and it was excellent, with something else I couldn't identify in addition to the chick peas, tahini, garlic, and lemon juice. For dessert I tried the baklava, which sadly was a little on the gooey side - the crispiness possible from the phyllo was probably lost over a few days of sitting. But aside from the baklava, this meal was superb. The waitress was genuinely interested in our opinion of the meal and was very attentive. It's a large space but had some divisions so it still feels comfortable, not cavernous.  We have been back numerous times, and have always been pleased. The gyro meat is great, and my kids really like the pizzas. In fact, my son orders pizza with gyro meat on it (off menu), which he sees as the perfect meal. The service has always been great, and one of our favorite servers in town works here. She is always friendly, attentive, and makes us feel at home."}
{"text":"So far it is not a bad cafe to hang out, with friendly staff. The bistro coffee shop includes a selection of coffees including nitro brew with pre package sandwiches and salads both hot and cold.  Price point is good and sandwich portions are good with a decent selection.  Staff says more to come, I could see it doing well if the have made to order sandwiches and salads as they have a nice amount of space upstairs.  One thing that kind of disappointed me is that all the coffee is made by an automated Nespresso machine rather than hand made by staff, not a big deal as the coffee was still good.   As it is only the first weekend of operation time will tell but so far so good."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding here!  Also, excellent and professional service.   Everyone at our table left very happy.  Without a doubt,  I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a new cafe in my neighbourhood but i was a bit underwhelmed by my first visit.  Because i went after work i picked up their packaged Penne meal which said caution its hot but the padta wasnt hot and the cheese on top solidified.  The padta sauce was just a generic cheap jarred sauce flavour.  I took it home to heat it up again but didnt even finish it.  I also got an iced coffee.  Not that great and the cup leaked.  I tried the pecan cheesecake which was a bit on the soft side but the best of my order.  Everything but the coffee is pre packaged.  Great for grab and go but not so enticing for their lovely patio."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and good food. The wait staff is very friendly. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in years.  This was excellent.  The service was fast and thoughtful.  Nice job facilitating our kid chaos.  The combo appetizer was excellent.  The stuffed eggplant also excellent.  Kids loved the Alfredo and spaghetti with meat sauce.  The Kofta was very good.  We will return.  Best Mediterranean I've had in Madison sine Shish cafe closed."}
