{"text":"speakeasy was a joke.  i used to be the head bartender at this establishment i should know.  the owner jon was drunk almost every night. never had enough food stocked the prices were to high and the selection of alcohol was interesting to say the least.  the started paying their employees under the table and now im sure are regretting some of the choices they made. heard through the grapevine they have closed their doors today which was well awaited seeing as it wasnt a smart business choice for him in the first place.  i feel bad for his beautiful wife judy.  my prayers are with her in this time seeing as who she has married.  i always respected her as a professional and wish her the best.  

If the word was incorrect then I apologize but that's what I'm being told from multiple people. 

worst work experience i have ever had and will never work for ANYTHING that he is connected to ever again."}
{"text":"The hostess is the best, she was also our server, but still - very nice and attentive. I've been for Brunch and Dinner and both were extremely delicious. The blue cheese crumble New York Strip for dinner was cooked perfectly - medium rare and absolutely delicious. There weren't many people there for dinner, but it's a new place and their location might be hard for some people to see. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not sure exactly what we were getting into, my wife and I turned into Speakeasy tonight. Given that it was only 5:30, there weren't many patrons, and the place is so large that it felt a little overwhelming. The interior is pretty rough, and it's hard to tell if they're going for a dive bar or prime steakhouse vibe. The menu was very limited, again, not knowing what we were getting into, I probably should've looked it up beforehand.
Fried raspberry brie appetizer - very good, could have used a couple more pieces of toast.
6oz filet, mushroom risotto, green beans with bacon - very nice cut of steak, cooked perfectly, and the risotto was great.
Beef Wellington - nice flaky crust and a good mushroom flavor. Again, the steak itself was cooked very well.

Overall, Speakeasy Saloon and Grill deserves a try if you're going out for steak. It's a bit expensive if you're thinking it's more of a lonestar/texas roadhouse type of place (like I was), but the food was VERY good."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for live music and saw a new place was opening and decided to check it out.  It's got a cool second floor that is great for watching the band and the dance floor.  

A country band was playing, but the decor is not at all country, so kind of a weird feel to it.  And it's not cheap.  $30 bottle of wine was excellent.  $10 shrimp appetizer was good but very small.  Looks like a nice place to go for a special occasion dinner.

Had a great time although it was fairly quiet at 11 p.m.  I expect it will get more crowded as more people hear about it and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is not good. Stay away. I put that right here at the top so everyone will see it and be warned.

What is Speakeasy Saloon and Grill? I don't thing even it knows what it is. Is it a speakeasy? Definitely not. Not even close. Of course the sign on the outside is toward the rear of the building so by the time you see it you have passed it, which is something you should do just keep right on driving, and when you walk it there is no hostess or even a hostess stand. So maybe it is. Is it a steak house? Not even close. To even think this place is a steak house is an insult to steak houses. Corporate fake Australian steak houses are better than this place. Is it a country bar? Kind of? The bar is made out of wood and they are playing country music but that is about it. There are no other decorations beside a picture of some cows way over in a corner.
When you walk in you immediately face their postage stamp of a dance floor and the quarter sized stage, well maybe a half dollar size. Then there are some stairs right in the middle of the place that lead up to what looks like a \"kind of nice\" VIP section, no one will ever know. Then on the other side of that are some tables placed haphazardly around with some black angus reject booths along the wall. Don't worry about finding a place to sit there won't be anyone there. There was only a family of three and two other guys there when I got there.
The place doesn't look nice at all. Possibly clean. I thought the menu was just a drink menu and was waiting for the real menu to be handed out when I realized this was the real menu. One of those tall leather books that in a real place would be a drinks menu and there are symbols next to some of the dishes but they don't mean anything. Way to go with that. The only reason I even bothered to walk in this place is my Mom had a groupon. Otherwise I would have never come here which turns out was the right choice.
The only things possibly good about this place was the service was good, but I feel sorry for the one server and one bartender because they will be out of jobs soon, and the bread was pretty good. That was it. Other than that is place was like one of those places on one of the many save my restaurant shows on TV. You don't think those places can be that bad but yes they can. If you call yourself a steak house you should know how to cook a steak. Their chief or cook or whatever he is called should be fired immediately. They cut into my steak to see if it was done!?! Really. You should have confidence enough in your cooking abilities to know when a steak is cooked how you want it. Cutting into it let the juices right out of it and made it dry and tough. Way to go with that. The baked potato was ok but be careful if you want it loaded you get charged $2. What you do get for this hidden fee? A pinch of cheese, one piece of bacon crumbled up and some sour cream and butter. Wow thanks so much for that.
Another thing if they are trying to be a country bar then you would think they would have standard beers on tap. Bud, Bud Light, Miller Lite stuff like that but no they have fancy no name beers on tap. What? Again I ask what are you trying to be.
When the bill came it was $50 and no way was that even close to a $50 meal. On no planet was that worth $50. The fake corporate place charges less and is way better then this place. Guess what they don't cut into your steak to see if it is done. They know when it is done.
Whoever opened this place must have read Starting a Restaurant For Dummies but didn't finish or only read though it not cover to cover. It is almost like they didn't have enough money to start up but went for it anyway. Figure out what you want to be and go with it. Don't try to be everything at once. Get a new chief who knows how to cook steak if you are going to be a steak house.
Maybe if this place figured out what it was it might be ok but if not they will be closed by this time next year. I should have given them one star but out of pity I give them two. Mostly because the service was pretty good even though the place and the food were horrible.
I don't want to be mean but this place is bad. One of the worst I've been to in awhile. Even my Mother, who isn't critical of places, thought this place was horrible too. Do yourself a favor just pass this place by and keep right on driving. There are some great places just a mile north of this place. Go to one of them."}
{"text":"I need to follow some of the other people who reviewed this place... What is it? The name Speakeasy means an establishment that illegally sells alcoholic beverages. Such establishments came into prominence in the United States during the period known as Prohibition (1920-1933, longer in some states). During this time, the sale, manufacture, and transportation (bootlegging) of alcoholic beverages was illegal throughout the United States. However, this Speakeasy is a country western bar, saloon that has a dance floor. The interior is not completed which gives a sense of bring rushed to open. One side has a large dance floor and the other side has table and booths to eat. The food was good, but the prices were high, even with a $30 Groupon used, our bill was $43, and we did not have any drinks.  This place needs an identity and a country western bar is not it...."}
{"text":"We wanted to try an establishment in Chandler, and was fooled by the word 'speakeasy' in the name. I have been to a few speakeasy places and always enjoyed them, thus a speakeasy saloon was different and a little exciting. All excitement was gone one I walked through those doors, when an atmosphere atmosphere of depression and melancholy embraces me like a brain parasite. 

The Good. 
Well, it was easy to find and there was lots of room due to lack of patrons. 
That's all I can muster up.

The Bad.
The Service is fantastically bad. The waitress we had was rough looking, and when I mean rough I mean Gulag-style kind of rough and the style of waiting followed suit. All of us felt she was hostile and passive aggressive. Even when someone tried to order from the bar, the bartender ignored them (probably so they had to use their hostile waitress) over and over. 
The service alone would have given this place a bad review.. but wait, there's more. 

The Absolutely Ridiculously Bad. 
Hair in the food of two dishes. A hefeweisen that looked like it was part milk, part water from the holy river of Ganges. Do NOT buy draft beers for two reasons; 1) they apparently don't treat their equipment and 2 ) then you need to use their glasses. They must have a broken dishwasher, because we had wineglasses that came out with lipstick stains, water glasses that came out just filthy. I am getting sick to my stomach in retrospective knowing that I actually ate some stuff here. 

Summary.
DISGUSTING. This place is NOT a steak house, and NOT a speakeasy. Bad service. Horrible hygiene. Well overpriced food, that also is questionable if one would dare to eat it. This place have done everything wrong. I wouldn't come back here even if I got a whole night comped. Disgusting place that I hope closes down as soon as possible."}
{"text":"The grand opening was ok. Our food was nothing special. However, our waitress was really nice and checked on us often. 
Ceating the 2nd floor was a great use of space. Although it's small, it gives a great view of the dance floor.
I think they should have hardwood floors throughout for dancing. The crowd after 9pm was a dancing crowd. If there was hardwood floors, they could have moved the tables to expand the dance floor. By 10pm, no one was sitting at the tables anyway, it was just empty unutilized space."}
{"text":"We went for the Buffet that they have on the weekends. First of all when I walked in it defietely looks like an old DIRTY Saloon. The buffet food was not impressive. There was only a few choices for the price you are paying for. 
It was not very busy and the waitress took forever to bring drinks and refils and our check. horrible experience and will not be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I like to give new places and unique concepts support. I love seeing people try to make a go of something they are passionate about and always hope for their success.  

On the bright side, our server was friendly and accommodating.  But, on the not so bright side, the ambiance was confusing and the food was not great.  I ordered a chicken dish they suggested as a top seller and found it so salty it was hard to eat.  The French onion soup was just OK, and the spinach dip was also odd.  I will say there was one thing I loved - the bread they serve was super tasty.  

Obviously the food needs help if they are going to be successful, but I also think that they need to clarify who there are in order to draw a sustainable crowd (it was crazy slow there when I went on a Friday around 7).  From the name, menu and 3/4 of the décor I'd expect a fun, old school experience.  If they went with that identity I'd imagine they could get a following from the local swing dance crowds plus others looking for a fun reason to dress up and go out on the weekend.  But, they are pretty obviously trying to do something country there, too ~ some country décor, country dance, country bands... it just ends up feeling confused.  I'm not sure the mix of everything ends up making it comfortable enough to either crowd.  Just my opinion, but if they picked a direction and went down it perhaps they could create something outstanding.  I do wish them the best. :)"}
{"text":"The first thing I would do before I just venture over to Speakeasy Saloon is call first and make sure they are opened.  I am not saying this because they have unusual hours; it is just a feeling that they won't be opened very much longer.
Where do I start?  Well, let me start with the good, I can tell you the \"service\" is very good.  Apparently, this is the one thing the owner of this establishment knows how to do.... hire good waitresses.  
Is the place really bad?  No.  Is it good?  No.  Fair?  Yea.
Let's start with the \"identity crisis\".  First, what is a \"Speakeasy Saloon\"?  Anyone who knows the history of the prohibition knows what a speakeasy looks like.  Everyone in Arizona has a pretty good idea what a saloon looks like.  Well, there is absolutely nothing, zero, na da, zilch about the inside (or outside) décor that says \"Speakeasy\" or \"Saloon\".  The décor inside is \"confused\".... modern fixtures and (comfortable) seating booths.  Granite/marble sofa tables mixed with wooden tables.  Cathedral/vaulted ceilings... in a saloon?  
The ONLY hint that this is a western themed bar/grill is the music and that the waitresses where cowboy boots.  They play country music and apparently at 9PM there are live country bands.  But this is NOT a place for \"dancers\".... not to be confused with people who \"dance\".  The dance floor is far too small to support progressive country-dances, a stable for country dancers.  It needs to be at least 6 times its' current size to support the Country 2-Step.  
The \"location\" of the dance floor is also unfortunate.  \"Dancers\" like to sit and stand around the dance floor so they can watch people dancing and ask others to dance.  There is a seating area and tables separated from the dance floor by the bar.  This is not conducive to people who consider themselves \"dancers\" (or for patrons who want to watch people dancing).  That brings me to another poorly thought out architectural aspect of this establishment, a long staircase that leads up to \"a platform high above the bar\" where you find tables looking down on the dance floor on one side and people seated below and eating on the other.  How the owner could ever imagine that staircase is not an accident waiting to happen I don't know.  Even without a drink or two in you, those stairs can be treacherous.  I hope that the owner was not \"dreaming\" that was where the \"dancers\" can sit to watch the people dancing.  Also, considering how unusually warm it was on the lower floor with very few patrons in the establishment, I can't imagine how hot it must get upstairs above the bar (heat rises!).  
We did have dinner at the Speakeasy Saloon and the food was fair to good.  It was nothing special and overpriced for the quality and portion sizes.  We tried the Mushroom Medley for an appetizer.... to our disappointment when it arrived, we found it was a small bowl of broth with sliced and whole mushrooms floating about.  It was sprinkled with cheese and some bits of toasted bread around the bowl for dipping... overall, disappointing.  We both had the grilled salmon entree, it was a very small portion and it came with some grilled vegetables.  It good.... once again nothing special. 
If you want to \"dance\" to country music and are in the neighborhood, you might want to venture over to the Speakeasy Saloon, but considering the vast number of restaurants in the Phoenix metro area and many not that far from this establishment, I recommend you eat elsewhere first.
Now, I will say this, there are very few \"country bars\" that have a large dance floor and serve food.  No bar/restaurant owner seems to be able to put it ALL together.  The Speakeasy Saloon has also failed.  The place isn't big enough to have a large enough dance floor.  It would take a total gut job (they should have one long bar along the south wall... dah.... just like a \"saloon\", make the dance floor larger and have the tables adjacent to the dance floor) to make it into a country or speakeasy bar.... but my God... pick a \"theme\" and go with it!  The food as it is now will never pull you into this place; they need something special... some kind of \"signature dish\" or more excitement with what they are serving now.

I suspect the owner ran out of money before he was able to finish what he started and was \"stuck\" with the décor that was already there and the overall layout.  If that was not the case, very, very poor planning and execution.
From what I saw on a Saturday night, I would be \"shocked and amazed\" if this place were still opened come August 2014."}
{"text":"Food sucked.  The menu looks fancy and the prices make you feel like you are getting quality, but it just didn't turn out that way.  The $12 hamburger tasted like they dug out a $0.99 single burger from a dumpster behind DQ.  Just not impressed.  At least they had a dance floor and band (why they got 2 stars), but we didn't hang around for that action.  I think this is the first time in my life I have gone out to dinner yet came home hungry and ate 2 bowls of cereal to satisfy myself."}
{"text":"The decor was bland. The window sills and windows were dirty. It felt open and spacious. 

The food was over priced, pretentious and mediocre. The drinks seemed to be reasonably priced. The staff seemed friendly. 

The dance floor was vinyl. It looks like wood, but was vinyl. Obviously the person who decided that was not a dancer. The bar area that is right next to the dance floor though was laminate flooring. Go figure... 

The live band was good! There were not very many people there."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I came back, but perhaps I would like this place to succeed instead of going out of business. Speakeasy is really deteriorating. Here are some of my gripes:

* There was no live band, which they always used to have. The DJ music was boring  with no variety.
* I was there with several people who wanted to dance. We left after about 45 minutes because the music was so bad. We asked the DJ to put something on that was danceable so after awhile he put on some awful hip hop rock stuff. In all fairness the DJ couldn't do much music because he was doing triple duty at the bar, tables, etc.
* Only two beers on tap, and they were just standards like Bud. They used to have one or two good craft beers. Blech!
* They had bottled beer - Bud and Bud Lite. Wow!!!
* I ordered a martini because the beer selection was so lousy. Bartender couldn't put vermouth in it because they didn't have any. That is the first time I ever saw that happen!"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and were disappointed. The sliders had only 2 sliders with the saddest looking patty's and no cheese. If you are trying to be a nice restaurant you can have decent beef for the sliders.  Also we were chatting and missed the end of happy hour, the bartenders were not that busy and could have reminded us.  I appreciate a good bartender who does this and tip accordingly.  Instead she came up at 7:07 and rudely reminded us that happy hour was over.  I give this place 6 months tops.  A shame too I like the concept."}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars to this place. The layout is weird, the decor is bipolar and the prices are ridiculous for the service & servings. 

Cream cheese, bacon stuffed jalapeños: 2 on the plate =$9
Ribeye, green beans, risotto: $33
Salmon, green beans, risotto: $19

No bread service, no salad service. The risotto tasted like it was rotten. The steak was like a shoe. 

We had to ask for napkins & silverware. We had to ask for refills & our waitress practically scolded my boyfriend for drinking his lemonade too quickly. 

Just... Don't."}
{"text":"Once I saw this place going up I was excited to go with my boyfriend, however i ended up going with a group of six friends.

To keep it short this place seems to be decor confused. Classy restaurant meets barn maybe? It's small in the inside an while the tables have white table cloths and candles in an attempt to be nice, there's writing all over the pillars inside so while sitting at our table I got to look at a permanent marker penis drawn on a pillar. Classy.

The food was way over priced I guess in an attempt to make it seem like you were getting quality food. My friend and I got pasta that was inedible. The shrimp in it was hard and the scallops were awful. It tasted so fake and I was confused to why it was an $18 dish. It was honestly reminiscent of a lean cuisine. No one else at the table seemed to like their food either.

Our first clue should have been how empty the place was. Oh well..at least the free bread was good!"}
{"text":"Nice people but food was not that good and seriously overpriced. The decor is confusing and it was dead in there. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good food and drinks! They are pretty new and everything doesn't quite \"flow\" yet but they make up for it in willingness and smiles!  Monica behind the bar was great."}
{"text":"Food was average at best and a bit pricey.  Owner may be off his rocker.."}
{"text":"I went here for an Ahwatukee Chamber event and enjoyed it. I didn't try to the food but they have great beer on tap and I loved the service."}
{"text":"We used our Groupon as a excuse to try out this steakhouse/bar/dance hall. It is down the street from our house and we are always excited to try new places. The decore of the place is confusing. Nice lighting, tables, and dance floor, but they let people write all over the pillers around the bar. It's like they can't make up their mind if it should be a restaurant or a dive bar. I think it really detracts from all the effort and money put in to make this place look nice.
At 5:30 on a Monday they had a good size crowd at the tables, but only one waitress. We decided to stay at the bar to order our drinks and dinner. The bar tender was friendly, and fun to talk to. She did a great job recomending what we should try, and getting us our meals in a timely manner. I ordered the NY strip and was very happy that it was medium rare like I orderd it. Most places mess that up. The meal was excellent and served with veggies that weren't over cooked. Looking forward to trying this place out on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon quite some time ago and just never got the chance to use it. Tonight we decided we had nothing to lose and went for an early dinner/happy hour. Big place, kind of neat, guess it reminds me of the Midwest so I loved the setup. Rachel was the friendliest waitress I think I have ever had on the West Coast! We ordered the shrimp cocktail and the spin dip and both were awesome! They should serve the spin dip with toast all around so we had to ask for more but no big deal. She actually brought us the jalapeno bites because she told the manager what a great table we were and they comped that. We both had burgers and I love the grill taste but my boyfriend wasn't too thrilled. The baked potato was great bc it was rolled in kosher salt like a bake potato should be! I had the woodchuck cider beer and it was great! We had a great experience and since we live close, we will be going back! (This review comes from a previous rest. owner so don't let the emptiness fool you! People are missing out!)"}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago I got free General Admission tickets to go see Chris Cagle at the Speakeasy Saloon.  I surprised my wife with the tickets who was excited to go. Thinking that we were going to get something to eat there we left for the concert.  We got there and right at the gate I knew something was going to happen. The guy at the gate says that only people that paid for tickets were allowed to go inside and eat but he said to check with security near the door. So we walked up and a family was standing in front said they were just kicked out by the hostess because only people with paid tickets could go in to eat. So we asked the guy at the door if we could go in.  The frustration was mounting so the security guy took us inside and confronted someone saying they need to stop refusing people. We thanked the guy and the hostess reluctantly took us up stairs. This is where the fun begins with this place. It appears that they were under staffed for this event because we got a bar tender and barback to take our orders. To make a long story short we ordered drinks and food. We got the drinks but never received our food as everyone else got theirs. We complained to the bar tender then he checked on our order which was never cooked in the kitchen. We had been there an hour with no food so the bar tender comped our drinks and we left for the concert.  Chris Cagle was awesome which made up for some of our experience. The management at the Speakeasy Saloon needs to get there act together when holding a major event. If you need more help then hire more wait staff, less security guards and food accessible outside. If you have a problem keeping up with the demand of food then cater from Rudy's BBQ across the parking lot. Not a great first impression for first time guests."}
{"text":"Alright, before I get started I want to say that the ONLY bright spot, the only reason this place gets a star, close to two stars is because of the bartender.  The bartender was fun, charismatic, and enjoyable.  Plus she did fireball shots with us.

Now some bad things.  It was dead.  With only us, and a couple of people around the bar, this place had maybe a handful of people and a few people eating.  The DJ played mainly country with a few older songs in there to try and get people on the dance floor.  When we danced we were the only ones out there.

We made lemonade out of lemons here...LEMON"}
{"text":"I was there for opening night Friday 1/25. I had the Grand Filet with Mushroom Red Wine Sauce. The steak was like prime and they cooked it perfectly. it was obvious they are working out some bugs since it was there first night open but i think they will do great. i love having a place that is about great food and entertainment. they have live country music and the place rocks after 9. it is also nice to get a steak i dont have to pay another 15 bucks for a starch and veg.  it may take a while to perfect but i think they may be on to something. great food and great entertainment."}
