{"text":"Very good service and food.  Had the seafood over angel hair and it was excellent .  My wife had zucchini pares an and it also was very good and a lot."}
{"text":"Went to Rodney's for the first time with the family.  Didn't make reservations so we had to sit in the bar area.   We had a variety of their pasta and seafood entries.  Everyone really enjoyed their dinner.  We shared their desserts because they were huge.   They food overall was all very good and prices were reasonable.  The service was great."}
{"text":"I love your bakery section! The little cakes, brownies and themed cookies, they are perfect for any occasion and taste delicious!! I had the raspberry white chocolate brownie around the holidays, I still dream of it."}
{"text":"This place has a nice warm atmosphere, servers are very friendly we had I think her name was louann super nice women! The first time we were here we sat inside nice clean dinning room I had the chicken parm it was amazing would recommend this dish. The second time I had a burger, it was OK you could tell it was a frozen patty wish they would of made them fresh, but we sat outside and their deck is beautiful. My fiance and I had some drinks off their drunk menu and both were very good. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was weary of trying a mom and pop restaurant deep in the suburbs but this place is really good. I recommend the hoagies, their pizza and their dinners. The food tastes like it's homemade, not frozen and then microwaved. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Another family event and the place is great for all sizes of groups. Reuben looked good,wife had pumpkin ravioli, I had the the steak salad which was a meal! All 9 enjoyed every meal ordered! Place was packed and I know why!"}
{"text":"Lunch at 11:30. Only a few people here. Initial service was very slow but due to an excellent hostess we were taken care of efficiently. Our food actually came out in the proper order that we arrived. Pasta sampler and Philly Cheesesteak were both excellent."}
{"text":"Hidden right off of Route 30 in Greensburg, this is the perfect place to bring anyone for a delicious, reasonably priced meal. I've been here twice in the past month and was really satisfied both times.The most recent visit was for a birthday lunch. We arrived with a party of 8 and our waitress was attentive and completed all orders correctly. Selections we chose were the club sandwich, Reuben sandwich, Steak, Salmon, and Grilled Chicken Salads, Pasta Fabrizi, Scrod with cole slaw, and mac and cheese for the kid.  First, they bring out fresh bread, which is soft and accompanied by soft butter for spread. Wow, was it good, and I'm not even a bread person. I could have eaten an entire basket myself. Our meals came out shortly after. My brother and husband went to town on $2 pumpkin beers, leftover from the season.   Some of us tried the soups as well. We had the french onion, tomato basil (chunks of tomato and generously seasoned), and cream of mushroom, which was FILLED with mushroom pieces and tasted somewhat garlicky. If you're into mushrooms, you would love this soup.  Nobody tried dessert this time, since we had cake at home. We split the check and for 4 people, the bill came to under $100 for 4 lunches, 4 soups, and 4 alcoholic beverages. The bathrooms were clean and easy to locate. If you're going for dinner, which we experienced the first time here, make sure to make a reservation or you will end up waiting (but well worth it)!"}
{"text":"Went there for my aunts birthday. Had a huge variety to select form. Anywhere from burgers and fries to steak and seafood. Personally, there's something for everyone. They brought out the cake from their own bakery and there was no cleanup. The waitress Susie had the biggest brightest smile on her face. Incredibly friendly and sweet. The bar was quite busy so it took a while to grab the drinks. Other than that it was a great time and even better food!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise...  We came here for our friend's birthday dinner and really enjoyed ourselves.    They serve a varied menu of mostly \"Italian-ish\" dishes that should be able to accommodate most food palates. If they don't do the trick, some standard pub-type fare also graces the menu, along with a nice salad selection to round out a pretty good set of options.  Plus, they have some ever popular appetizers that aren't too shabby, either.   My favorite thing about this place is their portions.  This place certainly delivers a bang for the buck as every diner at our table brought home an ample lunch for the next day.  Just don't forget to leave some room for dessert...they're pretty solid, too and definitely worth a try!  All in all...good food...good portions...great value!  I guess that's why parking lot was full...people know this place is good eats!"}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich for $8.95 the menu claimed it was a 6oz chicken breast the bun weighed more than the chicken.   ripoff"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Rodney's.  Because of the horrendously poor waiter service, we won't be returning.  Pasta dinner was good, Reuben sandwich decent. Stromboli was extremely disappointing.  Lots of dough, nothing inside. Composed a detailed email and sent to the email address on Rodney's website. Never received a response.  Enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"Walking in made me feel like I was back home at a feel good mom and pop restaurant. The waitress was nice but sadly that's as good as it got. I ordered the chicken parm with pasta. The pasta with the sauce was very bland and the chicken parm itself was at best, average. I went ahead and got dessert thinking it could make me feel like this was more of a sweets place, I was wrong. I went with the apple dumpling which took a couple of minutes to come out. That should've been an indication that it was nuked. The apple in the middle seemed slightly frozen still. When I got the bill I noticed the dessert, which the menu didn't have a price on it, was $7.95!!! That floored me to see how expensive a small warmed up dessert was. The dessert definitely needs to be less than the same prices as most meals. I wanted this to be good, but left feeling let down."}
{"text":"Rodney's is just off Route 30 on Arona Road in Irwin, PA.  Rodney's is a classy independently owned restaurant featuring American standards and a solid pasta menu. If you needed a nice place to take someone that won't break the bank, Rodney's is a dependable choice. Rodney's also offers catering services for parties and weddings. I like their large fish sandwich and I also like their wedding soup."}
{"text":"I am not sure why there are so few yelp reviews for Rodney's considering how long it has been a staple in the area.  I know I have gone here for several birthday gatherings, Christmas parties, Mothers Day dinners,and a few wedding and baby showers over the years.  Rodney's is as traditional as it gets when it comes to dining out.  Nothing fancy or unusual.  It's the go to place when trying to please multiple dining requests.  The lunch and dinner menu offers similar choices which makes it convenient for those not wanting a huge dinner and are leaning towards a burger or a sandwich.  They prepare the standard dishes.  Soup, salads, appetizers, hoagies, pizza (including a pierogie pizza made with mashed potatoes)stromboli's, pasta,seafood, steak, veal and chicken dishes.   The dining area is very spacious and comfortable.  They have plenty of rooms that offer private dining for larger crowds.  I especially love sitting out on their large, well- designed outdoor patio and bar during the warmer months."}
{"text":"Attending a surprise birthday party at this restaurant. Food was very good and the service was excellent. The accommodations were very nice. Overall, a very pleasant experience at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I recently went back here after saying I would never come back about 3 years ago. I was very impressed with how much they improved! There menu offered great options, and the dining area was updated and cleaner. That night, we bought multiple appetizers: the spinach artichoke dip, cheese sticks, and fried zucchini! All was made to perfection. My friend bought a fish sandwich and it looked delicious as well! The prices were reasonable, and the staff was great. I would defiantly come back after this experience!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review for Rodney's. I have been here on numerous occasions over the past several years, and each experience leaves me questioning the one before. Reason being, food and service (especially service) is hit or miss.  Some good points: About 10 years ago, I organized a bridal shower here. The food was good, we were given decent selections, and everything was reasonably priced. The bride and guests were pleased, so overall, it was a success. I was also here for a friend's surprise 30th birthday party and my aunt's 75th birthday. Both events were also fine. The food is fine, nothing exciting, but good. There is also a nice sized deck out back, which for me is the biggest draw, especially in the summertime when it's nice to sit outside and either eat dinner or have drinks with friends.  Some drawbacks: If you are having a large get-together, there is an upstairs room which can be rented for $50 (last time I checked). However, I was told they will not split the bill in any way. So, if you wanted to split the bill between a few people or pay for the room but have everyone pay for their own meals and drinks, forget it, they will not do that. Also, there is a strange transition time in the evening between late dinner-goers and those coming for drinks and mainly to hang out. There is a bar area, a dining room, a larger dinner room that kind of transitions into a dance floor and a stage for bands, and the outside area. So, if you're coming for a late dinner, they will charge you a cover. It's something that's always bothered me about the place. When my husband and I came for the surprise birthday party, we were asked to pay a $5 cover...unreasonable in my opinion since we were there for a sit down dinner / party. Naturally, I refused. Also, even though there is a pretty large parking lot, it can be hard to find a space since the place gets pretty packed in the evenings and weekends."}
{"text":"Very nice, and clean eatery. Did lunch on a Sunday with the family. And can honestly say that everyone with me enjoyed the food.  I personally had a cup of sweet chili which was very good and had the chicken Parmesan for my entree.  Oh yea and the rice pudding was off the hook good!! The only thing that kept them from a fifth star was the service was just a little slow. I will definitely be visiting again!!"}
{"text":"Great service (Pam) got our food fast. Everything was perfect. I had a  pecan chicken salad and my hubby had the roast turkey. A lot for a serving  we ate in the bar area. Very nice"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome steak salad!!! Delicious!!  we were waited on by a blonde haired lady who was very patient and nice!!  Josh and myself had a GREAT lunch!!! We loved  everything!!!

{"text":"Awesome food, great pizza and a really nice outdoor seating area. Nice bar area as well. Everything I've ever had from here has been well done"}
