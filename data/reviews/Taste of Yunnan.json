{"text":"Crossing the bridge noodles is a must try. Great flavor. Come here for authentic yunan favors. Decor and service could always be improved on but lets be honest you're not in Chinatown for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Reviewed Dish: Small Pot Rice Noodle  Reviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 3 / 5 Cooking speed: 1 / 5 Food Quality: 1 / 5 Food Quantity: 2 / 5 Price: 3 / 5  Cleanness: 0 / 5  Repeat: No  I couldn't help but notice this little South West Chinese Noodle shop as it was right beside a street car stop. After tasting the awesome \"Homemade Ramen\" down the street the day before, I decided to try out \"Taste of Yunnan\" without consulting Yelp.......  I walked into an empty restaurant, comparing to the full house at \"Homemade Ramen\"...... I have a bad feeling about it but I decided to give it a try anyways.  I know it is a smaller dish, but my heart sank when the table next to me received his noddle --- it's desert sized! Fortunately when my bowl of noddle arrived, it's slightly bigger...... Then I noticed half of the chopsticks in the holder are dirty........  I took a bite of the noddle, it's no where near the Homemade Ramen's noddle. This noddle is soft and soggy, it tastes and feels like wet and overcooked spaghetti, even the noddle had the same color as spaghetti! The meat is overcooked, and the bowl contained exactly 1 diced piece of tomato and (discolored) green pepper. I'm so glad I order the smaller size this time! Needless to say this is not a repeat."}
{"text":"This place serves the worst taste yunnan rice noodle in town. My frds who tried this place would never come back again. Neither do I ."}
{"text":"The food is quite authentic, down to the pu-er tea that they serve. The portions are very filling. Definitely get the crossing bridge noodles.   Contrary to the other reviews, I experience good service. I complained that the booth seats were too far away from the tables, and the waiter helped to move them in (these were heavy booths)."}
{"text":"OK, so its not the best but there a certain value to the simplicity of the menu. Focus only on Yunnan food, and bowls of noodle. First time, was the best. Good broth. Silky noodles. The third time, noodles overcooked. Its not very consistent but its $7 or less for a meal. Hard to come by..."}
{"text":"Traditional yunnan food. The restaurant is clean and service is good. I feel excited to see this traditional restaurant for yunnan food. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I just pay for the food, absolutely not the service. Bad sanitation! Prepare Food with a naked hand! We went there Wednesday night, and did not get the foods we ordered. They did not make any apology too. So bad!"}
{"text":"South-Western Chinese food is not well represented in Toronto, so I was happy to find this spot.  The decor is basic, but clean. Ordered: -Crossing the bridge noodles: broth and noodles were delicious -Spiced potatoes: spice sauce was good, but it looked like they used store-bought frozen fries -Baba (fried buns/pancakes): delicious"}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch with my friend and I like it so much that I actually came back for dinner. Price is good, servers are nice though maybe not attentive enough. Also I think there is msg in the food, which I am not very happy about, so look out if you want your food msg free.  Recommended dishes: I like their signature cross bridge rice noodle and the clear broth beef rice noodles, the clear broth wonton and pot stickers are very yummy as well. The chilli oil they supply for free are so flavourful!   Drink: I love the watermelon slush though it's more like watermelon juice, they will add sugar unless you advice otherwise. I like it without any added sugar."}
{"text":"Fantastic food with great service!!  Must try: XIAOGUO rice noodle! Steamed chicken and the milk tea!!!  This is the real original milk tea I've ever had Toronto wide. Homemade with black tea from Yunnan and Puer.   The chicken tastes like real meat. Pretty fresh and yummy. Healthy as well.  Would definitely come back again, and the price is fair. One drawback is pay by card over $20.  Wish for discount if paid by cash as Origination cross the street."}
{"text":"Normally, I would rank this place 3 stars for food quality and price but there was one thing that caused me to change my mind. I have been coming to this place for over 2 years and it offers decent noodles from Yunnan. I came here often enough to know that the restaurant provided the incentive for people to pay in cash (10% off). Today, I went in and paid in the full price plus around 10% of tip, which results to 20%of tipping on the food. The server told me that I wasn't tipping enough. First of all, I am wondering if the serve really worth the extra tips and secondly, I am not sure if the actually pricing is different. I did pay extra and walked away. Honestly, it is very little money but I think it touches the principles of business. They could have made this clear and no charge differently each time.   Also there are plenty of authentic Chinese noodle places nearby. There was an one across from the street, offering similar food."}
{"text":"The menu looked decent at Taste of Yunnan so we decided to give it a try. We ordered the sweet potato pancakes, beef slices and their most famous noodle dish (with big flat rice noodles). The bill barely hit $20 which was a plus. The ambiance of the restaurant was basic. It's not a restaurant that really stands out in Chinatown among the many other options.   The sweet potato pancakes had a very interesting texture. It was somewhat crispy on the outside, but soft and chewy on the inside. The taste and texture grew on me after a few more bites.  The beef slices were the best part of the meal. They were well prepared, not too chewy or soft.  Good balance of beef flavour and the soy sauce marinade.  Lastly, the noodle dish was ok. It was quite sour and the noodles were a little mushy. There was not as much ground pork as I expected, however the peppercorn in the soup added an extra kick to it."}
{"text":"The only restaurant I know in Toronto that serves food from the southwestern region of China. Good noodles and eats"}
{"text":"I'm from Yunnan and I think this place is quite authentic. The cross bridge noodle has the right tasting broth (similar to what you would get in Kunming). Another must is the fried potato. Now this is not your typical fries, this is Yunnan street food! The secret is in the sauce, which has a special bean paste from Kunming (????), fermented bean curd, and cilantro. Not extremely spicy, but it is very savoury. One thing I see other people complain about is the sogginess of noodles - these are rice noodles and can't be compared to the chewy ramen!  P.S. try their home made Yunnan moon cake too. It is different from Cantonese style moon cake. Stuffed with salty and sweet ham, these moon cakes really compare to the ones I used to eat growing up."}
{"text":"Restaurant was completely empty, and waiting time was pretty long. Owner was swatting flies as we waited for our order.   We ordered small pot vermicelli, which was not bad. I'm native Yunnan born, so the taste was pretty similar except the spicyness wasn't up to par.  Overall experience was alright. The service was good, except the filthy environment.  My advice is to not leave the utensils out as flies will land on them."}
{"text":"Umbrella Guy @ Taste of Yunnan. Came for lunch on a Thursday.  They have a rather large restaurant with seating for at least 50. However, it was basically empty. For the past year or so, everytime I pass this place during lunch time, it's pretty much empty.  I'm honestly surprised they are still in business, but maybe the crowds come in at a different time and I just happen to never see anyone.  The place doesn't look like it's been maintained very much, so it kind of looks old. Well, it's pretty much chinatown standard as far as I'm concerned with decor. Washrooms were also kind of rundown looking, but at least they had paper towels.  Having been to another Yunnan restaurant across the street called Origination and having the experience of having the Crossing Bridge Noodle Soup bowl prepared in front of you, I was somewhat disappointed when the bowl just came out already put together. We did come as a group, and several members ordered the crossing bridge, so maybe they decided not to put on the show in front of us.   Food takes quite a long time to serve up. I imagine the lack of customers contributes to this if they're just starting to prepare dishes when they're ordered. We waited on average 10-15 minutes before the first bowls arrived.  There isn't much service here. They'll come and serve tea and take your orders, but after that, if you need anything else, you're pretty much going to have to go up to the counter cause the person handling the cash is the same person handling all the orders and bringing out the food.  Despite the long wait, I do like the flavour of the food, so at least they're making sure to cook it properly. I don't know about authenticity, but the flavours were enjoyable to say the least. Portion sizes were pretty good as well.  I'm not sure why this place is always empty at lunch. Maybe because it takes so long? Perhaps the food quality? You definitely need to set aside some time if you want to enjoy a meal here."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. Maybe more if there are days when I'm hungover. Cross-bridge noodles are insanely delicious and some of the best cross-bridge noodles I've ever had. These noodles are pretty rare to find.  I also get their potstickers or fried cream cheese wontons. Good stuff."}
{"text":"We walked by on Sunday afternoon and the place looked pretty empty. My DH wanted the crossing bridge noodle so we decided to chance it. Service was ok - had to ask for water and tea mid meal as it wasn't brought when we sat down. We ordered the original crossing noodle soup (already mixed) when served, the cold rice noodle and wontons in clear soup. Everything was fresh and tasted good. We also ordered the steamed rice pork belly which was forgotten until the end of our meal. It was a small appetizer portion - 4 thin slices of pork belly steamed with spiced rice powder. A bit salty but would have been good with rice. We enjoyed our meal and I would recommend the dishes we had here."}
{"text":"authentic yunnan food. Even though the environment is quite dull but the food is good."}
{"text":"Not my kind of restaurant to go to for celebrating the end of school term. Place was empty @12noon when me and friend went in, kinda dark too. We ordered the beef noodle soup, corn pancakes, steamed tiny chicken pieces  in a tiny clay pot ( why did i even see a chicken neck in there??). I cannot describe the taste of the soup, my taste buds got mad at me. just noticed my friend putting chili oil and soy sauce w/vinegar to her soup frequently, she said she was \"fixing\" the taste, too. check your bill before you pay.. I did.got charged for an item that never reached our table..  To each his/her own. No second time for me here."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here before. I had no idea what I was ordering. An older gentleman who was working told me to try the dumplings since I don't like spicy food. I order the pan fried celery dumplings and they were awesome. I went back two days later and ordered more and ordered several other things that were also very good. The only bad thing I've noticed is a lot of their menu it written in Chinese so I have no idea what I'm ordering. I just pick a picture that looks good.  They even have a friendly Turtle on one of the tables."}
{"text":"Located in chinatown,  I always like to try out different types of asian food.  When I saw this, I wanted to try it out.  It is pretty good.   I didn't taste any MSG.   The price was reasonable.  I think more people need to discover this place since I think the noodles are one of my favourites.  You can eat and finish the order in 20 minutes.   I think the older lady is the owner here.   I haven't tried the other items on the menu but I always get the noodles."}
{"text":"*One of the most popular dish in Taste of Yunnan was the cross-bridge rice noodle. I have been here over 10 times and I keep getting the same dish lol.   -Cross-Bridge Rice Noodle - $8.99 *The server will bring out all the ingredients and assemble the noodle bowl on the table. The idea is that the meat, followed by the egg and noodles should be cooked through within a few minutes. Finally the fresh herbs and pickled vegetables are added as a garnish.  The broth was light and tasty, not overly salty and no MSG! There was a light film of oil on top which was normal as the oil would keep the broth hot enough while being transferred from the kitchen to the table. The meats and vegetables were cooked just right. Some people might compare this broth to a Pho broth, I would disagree (I'm not being bias because I'm Viet..lol). The broth here was a simple chicken broth, while pho had more spices (cinnamon, star anise) in it, but at the end of the day, both are delicious and I can quite easily eat two bowls of it."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice. The food is actually quite tasty. Nothing spectacular but great taste for a cheap price. I had the small pot rice noodle twice and both times were very pleasant."}
{"text":"The cross bridge noodles are basically the Pho of China! Super delicious, and amazingly priced. I think you can get totally full here for less than $5. We had the cross bridge noodles, the cold noodles, wontons and a meat dish. Total came up to just under $25.   Would definitely come back. It's not fancy food by any means, but it's Asian comfort food."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood spot.  Food disappointing. Our noodle soups were only noodles and broth.  Hardly any veggies and meat.  Not really a bargain."}
{"text":"Very good food at very good prices. The small pot flat noodles were delicious, and the pot sticker dumplings were quite nice. The crossing bridge noodles also lived up to expectations as the signature dish of the establishment."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Taste of Yunnan while looking for a place to eat in Toronto. The food tasted authentic, and the server was very helpful and kind. We ordered the steamed chicken soup, steamed beef, and spicy beef noodles. Each dish (the first two were more like small appetizers) was delicious, and the meat from the steamed appetizers literally melted in our mouths. They also have devices on each table for you to signal to the waiter if you need service/water/bill/etc. it was our first time in Toronto, and we were pleased with our meal."}
