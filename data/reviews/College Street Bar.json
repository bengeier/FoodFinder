{"text":"Looked impressive but when I got in they said 5 bucks cover! What are you thinking owner if the club! I'm coming in to spend money on drinks and I have to pay cover. This is dump! My friends said let's go but I paid just to check it out. I was sitting in the front and watching people come in and faster out when they heard 5 bucks for cover. People don't want to pay cover. Their was about 20 people that left. To the owner that's money lost in drinks. That's bad management buddy. Anyways I would of come back bud like I said its a slap in the face me. Greedy. I won't come back or recommend this barn to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here with a few of my friends for dinner.  Service was sufficient and while everyone thought their dish was great.  One of my friends had the seafood risotto and thought it was one of the best risottos she's had so maybe it's the dish I selected.   I had the Penne & Sausage which also had spinach, roasted red peppers, sundried & fresh tomatoes.  I really like sundried tomatoes, especially in pasta but found that it really lacked flavour in the few pieces that were in my pasta.  Overall it was just okay and a bit boring half way through."}
{"text":"Great for any occasion date night, anniversaries, birthdays, ladies night, guys night out, private events, bachlorettes, and just a night out to have a great time with good people, Beautiful ambiance, live music or DJs, beautiful smiling people, bartenders with personality and great drink skills, amazing fresh, unique and delicious cocktails, bar going up in flames, sabreage(what is this you ask Sabre a bottle of sparkling wine open behind the bar with one of the sexy bartenders just buy the bottle)and a heated back patio all which will make a night to remember with whom ever your there with! Get a drink made by the Cocktail Messiah he will change how you perceive the cocktail world!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is a gem! Its gorgeous inside and they have an awesome back patio! Great for dates or groups! I like when you can trust your bartender, to be able to say \"make me anything\" and its always something delicious! They have a very large selection of well everything behind the bar and are very knowledgeable about the unique drinks they make! The staff are amazingly personable and will make sure you never want to leave! I have seen so many cool things here! (they light the bar on fire!) If you like live music JukeBox Wednesdays and Off The Hook Sundays are the days for you! They are so talented and its such a intimate atmosphere by the end of the night everyone is talking and dancing, you will always make new friends! The stage presence of the artists are truly phenomenal you wont want them to stop! Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays they have out of this world Djs who play such a perfect variety of old and new , I never want to stop dancing! The crowd that comes here is great - all different ages and styles which creates an amazing vibe and chance to meet tons of friends! They really make you feel special at College Street Bar!  I also must say the interaction between the Bartenders Djs Artists and Customers is something special especially when its rammed in there what an totally kick ass experience!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't our first choice on a Friday night for dinner, but there wasn't a wait and our group was hungry.  For an almost 1/2 empty bar/restaurant the service could have definitely been better.  The food was lost somewhere between regular bar food and good Italian cuisine.  The drink menu had a variety of choices which was nice.  Around 10, a DJ starts and a crowd steadily arrives.  Overall, a decent place to grab a drink with reasonable pricing but would suggest to look elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"Have been stopping in at the this bar on College Street for the last 5 years. You never know what is going to be happening in there. I have walked in  on a Thursday night and it was a raging party while the rest of the street was dead.

Food is pretty good but mostly have went for the DJ's."}
{"text":"they call themselves a cocktail school but apparently these fresh out of class bartenders have no proper training. one of the absolute worst martini's i've ever had, how do you mess that up?"}
{"text":"I had dinner here on a date on a Wednesday. The place was fairly empty when we arrived and we took a table for two by the wall. We started with red wine and some Bruschetta. The waitress was friendly enough and we were happy that we didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive.  I ordered the Seafood Linguini with tiger shrimp, scallop, mushrooms in a tomato basil sauce.  The food is reasonably priced for what you get...It wasn't awful and filled me up, but I wouldn't rank the food as anything spectacular. 

The main problem I had with this place was the way the tables are seated. While explaining a story to my date, you can hear the guy behind us talking.  When I got up, I was afraid to push my seat back too far as it may result in colliding with him...

A large group came in and was seated at the table on our left. That was when I felt uncomfortable. It felt like we were cornered/squished in a corner against the wall. I stalled on taking a trip to the washroom cause there was no room to even get up! Well we eventually had to leave right? lol I had to literally interrupt their table and ask kindly if they could make some room for me...It would make a HUGE difference if the tables were more spaced out! 

It's not the best place to have an \"intimate\" dinner, I think I will skip on it next time."}
{"text":"Had more than a few great nights here. The bar tending is awesome, they know what they're doing and they're really engaging and can get the crowd pumped up. Good mix of people in here on any night. Service here is good too!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with friends..we got the cucumber Collins, college street car & thr new fashioned. The drinks were all well made. The college street car is toasted at your table and tastes quite nice if you're into sweet drinks!! The prices were decent for the area and the spot had a great trendy vibe!"}
{"text":"the stuffed chkn with asparagus is perf!, 

this place is perfect in the summer for a dinner date.....plus its right across PAAEZ..."}
{"text":"Never have I waited so long for food. An hour in and the food still had not arrived. There were no servers checking up on us and there was no communication among staff. 3 different people had to \"check up on our food\" and no one got back to us about the status of the food. The server was so immensely rude and condescending. 
We went during a Taste of Little Italy which is a FESTIVAL and they only had 2 cooks staffed. When asking why the food took so long, I all I got was a snarky rude answer about how they have only been open for a few months and only 2 cooks in the kitchen. It also took them 40 minutes from the time our cups were empty to refill our water. The food was sub par and it took well over an hour and a half to get 4 out of 10 appetizer-sized dishes out - the ones that were on special for the festival. Because of this we didn't even get to try everything we ordered. I will never return nor would I recommend this place to anyone. Why would you open up the patio and put dishes on special if you cannot handle the volume?"}
{"text":"Had a great time here Halloween weekend. The new owner Gavin made an effort to socialize with patrons and created a super friendly atmosphere! I will definitely be visiting again. Thanks"}
{"text":"Showed up after midnight on a Friday. A friend and I paid no cover. The front door guy was a little goofy but nice, I think he needs a friend, one that isn't us. DJ was awesome, even played a bit of soca, respect. Not sure what's up with the same one flare move the bartenders were doing. I bartender too, just make me my damn drink guys come on! :)
Spent about $100 buying drinks for two friends that night and had a really good time. Place wasn't too loud or too rammed. Patio-ish arwa too. Got a free shot. I was a happy guy."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience here, although it seems like my brethren did not. That being said...

I used a dealfind coupon I had bought. That is what brought me here on a Wednesday night. That and the fact that I have nothing but butter, champagne, and a portobello mushroom in my fridge. Time to eat out! The coupon said that I had to make a reservation to use it, so I dutifully called up last night at 5pm and asked if I could come at 7:30. The short notice wasn't a problem at all. Of course when I got there we were the only table in the restaurant. No wonder they weren't concerned about seating my coupon-loving self. The service was good throughout the night, despite the fact that they knew I would be using a coupon.

We ordered a antipasti platter to share as an appetizer. It was pretty good! Olives, artichokes, grilled red pepper, procuitto and salami. It was pricey, but hey, I has a coupon! Good portion sizes.

For dinner we split the linguine with seafood and the linguine with smoked chicken and pancetta. Both pastas were good, although I think my seafood pasta was better. A healthy serving of mussels, calamari, shrimp and scallops. I had it prepared with the white wine and garlic sauce at the suggestion of the waitress.

We split the dessert duo (creme brulee and tirimisu). Both were made in house and were very nice.

The only real downside to the meal? Waking up at 4 am DYING of thirst. Guess the meal had more salt than I realized!

Dinner for two came to $90 with tax and tip ($30 after the coupon! Yeah dealfind!) for a sharing appetizer, two pasta, one dessert and two alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"I was there on Saturday night with a few girlfriends. We would visit again for another epic dance party but do really hope they can gather a better crowd. We loved nearly every song played (pop, hip hop, old favourites), but the scene was lacking (gal to guy ration was about a 4:1 at best). It wasn't awful by any means and it depends what you're even looking for. I wouldn't mark it off the list though; definitely check it out if you're looking for a night of dancing. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I went on Friday night because my friend had her engagement party/let's get drunk celebration there. 
I skipped dinner and they wanted to charge me $5 cover to get in...to a bar. I managed to get around it, with difficulty, but otherwise I would have just left right then. 

I was surprised at how packed the place was. I do think that's partly because of the layout which is quite long but not very wide. There is also a small little back area behind the dance floor on the way to the bathroom which you could easily miss and it's the quiet dark area for people uninterested, I guess. 
It is not cheap. A pitcher of domestic beer cost $19 and the options were few. 
The crowd was a strange mix, but definitely one I hadn't seen before. A mix between young 20s and early 30s, mostly. 
The bartenders weren't particularly friendly. 

The dance floor is small and there is a screen where they play music videos, which was kind of cool. The  music selection is what made me laugh. 
It was early 90s hip-hop R&B and rap. I honestly felt like it was a way-back playback. 
now, whether this is their normal music or not, I can't say, but judging by the crowd I'd say it might be. 

It was cool but we left by 1 if not earlier because it was a little too packed and went on and on...not enough 'mix'."}
{"text":"A so-so place to hang out on a Friday night. 

I met some friends here for some post-midnight hangings outs. At the door I was greeted by what I assumed was the bouncer, as he didn't move or say a word to me. I gave him my ID and he opened the door for me, which was nice. 

The space itself is pretty comfortable. We had no trouble getting a table. The dance floor filled up at around 1am, when I guess people were drunk enough to try to dance. The DJ basically played 30 seconds of a song, and then mixed and transitioned it to 30 seconds of another song. All night long. I probably heard 800 songs in the two hours I was there. The selection was great, but it was pretty annoying to find that a song had changed by the time you hit the dance floor. The music also got progressively louder as the night went on, making conversation basically impossible around 1am (probably why people started dancing)

There is a small patio out back for the smokers, and ONLY for the smokers, as the air was was thick. You could smell it on the way to the bathroom, which was pretty gross.

The beer selection was fine, something like $7 a pint including tip which isn't bad these days.

I think I'd go back, but only if they changed the DJ, or the DJ decided that he might play more than 5 bars of a song someday."}
{"text":"If you want mediocre cocktails and rude attitude, then this is the place to go.

I came here on a Thursday night around 11pm and the place was empty - literally no one in the entire bar.  Yet, there was a DJ spinning really loudly.  The music was sort of clubby and didn't match the feel of the rest of the bar. 

When I got up to the counter, I asked if they had Fireball whiskey (they didn't - but that's fine), then I asked if they had any hard ciders since I saw they did have a few things on tap and some bottles in the fridge.  The bearded bartender then says \"honey, this is a *cocktail* bar\" and starts to giggle.  That's when I should have just left.  If there is no one in your bar on a Thursday night, I'm not sure why your first instinct would be to talk down to your only two customers there as soon as they walk in the door.  So I just ordered a Cucumber Collins instead.  It was fine - nothing special.

Then my date goes to order an old fashioned.  Instead of the bartender just making the drink, he goes \"I think what you really want is a Friends with Benefits\" and starts making that drink instead of what was ordered.  

I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.  The bartender just hung around in front of us and kept talking to us about all of the liquor selections he had to play with and was trying to impress us by concocting some new drink and throwing bottles and glasses around.  I would have much preferred to have been left alone by the guy who had just insulted me and my date.

Avoid this place unless you like being talked down to."}
{"text":"There's a smooth and cool atmosphere here. The service is good and there are usually seats available when you arrive. 

One thing is for sure, college street bar isn't anything special or unique. When you think of little Italy you think of pizza, pasta, gelato, antipasto, and friendly service.

You get that all here, but something is missing. Although the selection is there, the favors and tastes are mediocre. Not one dish I had impressed me. I didn't find myself wanting more when I left.

My gnocchi was OK but tasted like something I could have made myself. The same goes for their meatballs. 

Overall, try something else on this vast strip of culinary taste and adventures. There are restaurants here more worthy of your visit. Cheaper and much more memorable."}
{"text":"Fancy drinks with awesome food. Didn't expect that food can be as good as drinks in a bar!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place on College Street which does one thing better than probably anywhere else on the street... Being a restaurant during the evening and becoming a decent dance club at night.

They have a decent selection of beer on tap including lots of Toronto breweries, and the bartenders are all pretty on the ball at night. We've also eaten dinner here a couple of times, and were for the most part impressed. The best thing I've had was the Supreme Chicken which was really good, and composed of chicken breast stuffed with spinach, red peppers and mozzarella, with a side of mashed potato. It was actually really impressive tasting and very satisfying. My date had the Seafood Linguine one time if memory serves correct, which also went over well. Otherwise they also usually have specials, although when I had the veal it was pretty lacking. Also we came here once with a Dealfind voucher and noticed the portions actually seemed smaller than normal which was kinda shameful on their part, but I haven't seen them run a group buying campaign since so I don't think that should effect anyones future experience.

Looking past the dinner side of things, I also enjoy this place for its night time action. It is more of a lounge meets club vibe, good for shmoozing and also a fair sized dancefloor near the front where the dj sets up. Between the many Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays I've stopped in for have heard everything from funk, hip hop, and rock to funky house and electro to crappy commercial rap and top 40. So it can be a crap shoot at times, but when the music is good its usually pretty darn good and worth hanging around for a few drinks. The only downside on that tip is their soundsystem isn't the greatest.

So what to make of this place? Well if you're looking for a place you can have a later dinner and still want to hang around after, this is definitely a good choice. It's also not bad if as a place to stop into for a few drinks during a night out. Would I recommend coming here just for dinner? I wouldn't bad mouth it, but there are probably better places within a few blocks."}
{"text":"College Street Bar is exactly what it sounds like - a bar on College Street. There's nothing particularly spectacular about this place. It has a nice patio out back, a dark, ill-lit interior with your basic black, pseudo-swanky decor. I don't know if it's because College Street is saturated with a million bars just like it, but I never feel that this bar offers anything out of the ordinary. I've had drinks here a couple times but always to move on to bigger and better things. 

Drinks are moderately priced and the bar also serves as a restaurant dishing up inexpensive Italian fare. The restaurant also appeared on Restaurant Makeover, but, in my opinion, to no avail. 

College Street has tons of great restaurants and bars, but its namesake isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  People who give this place a good review / rating don't know food.

Everything was bad. Food was either not cooked properly, tasteless or just plain disgusting (should a review ever have the word disgusting!) Appetizers are expensive and tiny!!! Calamari was one piece made up to look fancy.  Also DON'T go with larger parties unless you want to tip 18% for crappy food and service. 18% is automatically added for groups over 6. Odd that when you make the reservation and when you arrive a list of rules and information is told to you but the automatic tip is mysteriously omitted.  Seems a bit like a scam.  It's cheap bad food that is way way too expensive. Alsoit's too loud to have a nice meal. Is it a bar or a restaurant? DONT WASTE YOUR TIME / MONEY.  Just thinking of this place makes my blood boil! 

You're only going for a drink you say? Still stay away! They have a nice size martini section on the menu.  however they are again OVERPRICED. Money Grab. Martini was not good and even seemed to be light on the alcohol.  I'll drink and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"College Street Bar is one of my favourite places in Little Italy to venture to on a good night out.

First of all, it has NO COVER CHARGE. This is already an amazing introductory feature as many people hate paying cover and a lot of people, including myself, love to party it up at more than one location sometimes.

Secondly, it has great drinks and a decent food menu with yummy snacks and some full dishes that are flavoured with Italian themes.

Thirdly, THE MARTINIS ARE AMAZING! They have a long list of martinis you can choose from and they are all delicious. And what is even better is the taste of the full drink and not just the alcohol used in it.

Last but certainly not least, the entertainment is always good. They always employ hot DJs to spin their magic and pump energy into the bar with vintage and current music hits.

Overall, I just love this bar!"}
{"text":"We were being very west-end - out on College Street looking for a quick, late night bite after attending an art exhibit opening at a Bathurst Street gallery. 

We'd actually gone in to Utopia a few doors west, but Utopia was full and we were too hungry to wait for a table. 

We must have caught College Street Bar at the very end of dinner service as they seemed to start charging cover just after we arrived. The DJ was already playing and the place was starting to fill with 20 somethings there to drink. I really wasn't expecting much in terms of food. We were clearly the only table there to eat and the night had moved on from dinner spot to loud, bad sound system lounge. 

The service was laid back, but genuine. I had the green salad followed by the lamb Bolognese gnocchi and my partner just had the gnocchi with the cream sauce, add chicken breast. 

My salad was delicious. Fresh crisp greens with perfectly grilled red peppers and sliced Roma tomato tossed in subtle wine vinegar with very good quality olive oil. 

My lamb Bologneses was very, very good. Robust sauce with gnocchi that, if not house made, certainly fresh. 

The plating for both dishes made it clear that the food had been prepared by somebody who cared about what they were doing. 

Avoid the by-the-glass chardonnay unless you have a thing for really horrid wine. For some reason, it took me two glasses for it to sink in just how bad it was. I'm talking - clean rust stains off the sink - bad."}
{"text":"I went here last night for a few drinks in a group of 4. It is a very nice small bar in Little Italy. The cool night air was refreshing and this bar had their windows open to let it all in. Upon entering there was dark wood tables and chairs, candle light, exposed brick, dark wood wainscoting, a dj, a long glass tiled bar, and a nice quiet patio in the back. The bar felt welcoming, seductive, and kinda trendy.

Maybe it was an off night but service was shit. Not just any shit but runny, nasty, putrid shit. The shit you wish never existed and can't imagine come from a living being. It wasn't busy when we walked in so I would expect service to be on the ball but they weren't.  The waitress that served us wasn't really the brightest and forgot what drinks we ordered several times and had to come back to ask again 15mins after we ordered. If you forget thats cool, I mean I forget shit all the time but 15mins after we placed our order? You can do better than that. That is ridiculously slow. That's so slow it could possibly be a special gift, a very special gift. What was she doing in that 20mins before placing our orders? 

Throughout the night she was also putting on her jacket, grabbing her purse and would leave the place for 30mins. Where is she going? Oh I know! She went to leave us without a replacement waitress so we ended up having to go to the bar ourselves. The staff at the bar on the other hand were pretty cool. Laid back and unpretentious. Up for conversation. Super friendly. 

We also ordered a spaghetti, calamari, and bruschetta... wtf. It never came. I know our waitress was dumb but she actually put the order through, I assume, because when we got our bill the food was on it. So I think that's the kitchens fault on that one. Again another shit stain on service. Around 11pm our server's friends came to the window, they started talking and she left for the night. We were given another waitress... THANK GOD!

But to no avail she sucked balls too. She was rude, didn't look at us, and didn't know what to recommend. Not even a small smile, at least the dumb girl was smiles ear to ear. She also forgot what we ordered a few times but she had the decency to come back within 3mins to ask us. Is everyone here high or something? I haven't experienced this much temporary memory loss since I was in college. It's not like we were ordering complex drinks or abundant amounts of stuff. Simple things like beer, gin and tonic, maybe even a scotch. 

Overall the drinks were priced nicely. I don't know about the food but looking at all the other tables that actually got their order it looked mediocre and can't say it is worth the $15 price tag. The atmosphere was great and the decor relaxing. Too bad all the service sucked massive nuts because it would be a great place to have a few drinks and maybe eat if your food actually arrives. Come for drinks but stay at the bar because the waitstaff can't handle simple orders. I feel compelled to go again just to see if the service is this bad all the time and maybe to enjoy the quiet patio."}
{"text":"My favorite spot N & I stopped at on Thursday night! We didn't have anything to eat here we just enjoyed a cocktail."}
{"text":"This place at night is bangin!! Maybe it's the night I went too and the dj they had, but they have amazing music friendly bar staff and amazing enviroment.

The place is a little tight for space, but it's perfect for an intimate setting. They attract a crowd that are friendly, sexy, will party and enjoy the night as much as possible.

I've never been here during daytime, but I can definitely recommend this place at night when it turns into a lounge."}
{"text":"I happened into the College Street Bar on a Sunday evening and it was the best decision I could have ever made.  

First of all, the bar staff was very helpful and inviting.  The drinks were good and even the martinis were pretty good.

Secondly, the band they had there was kick-ass.  It's not every night you get to see a white guy do Sir Mix-a-Lot's \"Baby Got Back\", in my opinion, better then the original.

My only gripe was going to the bathroom there.  Cause it was kind of packed I had to walk right in front of the band sometimes.  


This place may not be spectacular but it sure reminded me of some of my favorite bars back in Columbia, South Carolina.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This place used to be much better years ago! I went on a Saturday night with two others, it was remarkably slow at 7 pm, thus service was pretty good as there were only 3 tables to cater to. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs but it was ridiculously spicy! There was no pepper or indication on the menu. So thankfully my fiance gave me half of his panini which was OK for my spaghetti as it was completely inedible. Sangria was super overpriced at $30 a pitcher, but the panini was only $10 which was a decent serving of cheese + chicken. I would definitely not go back there after that spaghetti mouth on fire experience!"}
{"text":"The College Street Bar is revamping their menu and I was invited to the media event on Thursday evening.

Brad Cooper provided entertainment ... he was good!

We were each given two drink tickets.  I tried a Hemingway Daquiri ... and it was good.   Gord ordered an Apocalypse which was fun.  The sugar cube and 151 were lit on fire ... then you sip from the lime and then from your drink.  I also ordered a Rosemary Bramble ... it was sweeter than I expected.  Gord ordered a CSBloody Mary.  I've never seen a Bloody Mary shaken before.  It was quite spicy.

Samples of food were brought out.  The grilled cheese were my favourite.  The pork sliders are on donuts.  The Smoked Mac & Cheese was good.  I thought the chip overpowered the taste of the poutine.

It was fun to go to this restaurant tonight and check out what they now have to offer.  The servers and hosts were friendly."}
{"text":"Shit service. Venue is too small.
But it's still a nice place if you go for drinks early. 
Once the DJ comes on, and the place starts to fill, leave and go somewhere else. It's not worth the wait for dirnks."}
{"text":"Awesome place. First off the DJ is awesome.  Once the place turns into more of a club, the place is hopping.  Overall the menu has a good selection.  Good quality and prep is great.  Taste is great.  I've been there for brunch before and I highly recommend the chicken and waffles.  I don't know who Sonia S is that left a one star review, but I think her taste buds are shot and had poor taste to begin with as the cocktails are great!! If there is any cocktail you can think of they will make it and make it right.  Thumbs up CSB!!"}
{"text":"I went in with a group of 10 people. I had gotten the mac and cheese and the description was very misleading. It made it sound so yummy but the food was just plain and had no taste. I think box mac and cheese would have tasted better. We stayed a bit later and it turned into a more clubby vibe but must say the crowd is more mature (late 20s-30s)."}
{"text":"I came here to grab a quick bite to eat and some drinks with a friend late on saturday night.
I had no idea what it was but it was packed inside! It looked romantic with candle lights on the tables and they advertised there was a live dj all night.
So we got inside and seated ourselves. Immediatly we were served water and menus.
It was mostly italian food. We both ordered pasta and drinks..
The food came quick and was very good. The waitress was very friendly and was great!
There was a bus boy that was always quick to grab stuff off the table when we were finished.
The place itsself is very nice inside.
At the back of the restaurant there is an outdoor patio but you cannot really hear the music. 
The djs were really good! :)

Im going back!"}
{"text":"I came every now and then and the staffs are always very friendly. They don't have just average bar tenders, these guys are mixologists. They have some pretty fancy drinks and if you like your scotch, they have a pretty good selection also. Week days can be somewhat mello but the weekends gets bumping at night. Overall nice vibe."}
