{"text":"This is a clean deli place run by a friendly couple. I mostly eat the oven baked chicken breast and it is really great. Owner Jay always jokes and entertains you interesting conversation.  Overall a nice place to grab quick breakfast or healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Should have done a review a long time ago, but I am new to Yelp. You will always feel welcome here, not only is it home cooked food you know it's made with care and pride. This is   what it was like if you grew up in a friendly town.
P.S. the baked chicken or ginger beef on brown rice is awesome. Also try the pound cake with cinnamon!"}
{"text":"Small convenient cafe which serves sandwiches, coffee/tea and korean food. 

I tried the Bi Bim Bap today; it's by no means what you'd get at a sit-down Korean restaurant complete with sizzling hotpot, so don't expect that. But for a take-out non-sizzle version, it was pretty decent, full of fresh veges, a little side of beef and korean hot sauce- $6.70 including tax
Friendly and fast service"}
{"text":"Just grabbed some bibimbap on my way back to work and it was totally decent! Owner added some jap chae for $1 which seemed unnecessary but it was tasty. Very friendly and fast service for sure."}
{"text":"This place is run by a lovely couple.
The man is quite funny cracking jokes and breaking out in singing songs.

I used to come here often however I've steered clear for awhile. 
Their hot dishes are great for lunch - comes with a side salad.
I usually go for the spicy chicken which is loaded with flavour and packed with veggies. 
I reason I stopped coming here is because every time I had a choice of what I wanted, the wife would try and change my mind.  \"how about you try the stirfry with rice - it's really good\".  The only reason she would offer me certain dishes is because there was one serving left and she wanted rid of it 

I just want what I came in for.  So this is why I haven't come back.

If you do pop in though - grab a pork and veggie springroll.. they are SO good."}
