{"text":"Food: Karahi's are as good as back home, there is no difference and I have no doubt in claiming that there is no better Karahi in GTA than theirs. They are not dumbing down the spices to please the regular audience and are keeping it authentic.  HOWEVER, literally everything else in this place is a disaster. If you go there to dine in, be prepared to wait at least an hour before they serve your food. If you order ahead, guess what? you're still waiting at least half an hour for food. Tables are dirty, washroom is filthy and there is barely anybody looking after the seating area for customer's needs.  If you wanna have authentic food from back home with all the masalas intact, this is the place, but that's all you're going to get."}
{"text":"Food was good but the price was a bit high, they could use an upgrade customer service was not bad as well"}
{"text":"The food is ok and long hours is a plus. However customer service is beyond pathetic and the owner is notorious for over charging. Have ordered exactly same food at different times and paid different price. With a lot more options available, I will definitely NOT recommend Hot Plate !"}
