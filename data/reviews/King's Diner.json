{"text":"Remembering this is a diner and not gourmet dining this place has really decent diner food at very reasonable prices"}
{"text":"When I lived in the neighborhood I would at least eat here once a week!  It's still a \"go-to\" place when I'm in the neighborhood! Why?  The food is fresh and tasty, the service is prompt and courteous, the decor is warm and pretty, and the prices are unbelievable!  Example: A burger and fries is 6 dollars!! I love their chicken club-no deli meat here, just real chicken.     I hope to move back to this area and if so, I'll definitely be a regular again."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Inexpensive, great food, generous portions.  So glad I discovered it. Staff is really friendly, service excellent.   Will come back again... and again"}
{"text":"Great little neighbourhood joint. Pleasant and attentive staff. Such a price for a standard breakfast. Food was fresh and tasty. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Walking into King's Diner is like walking into a living room. High ceilings, wooden furniture, carpeted floors. It's definitely a local joint, with a great family vibe - the type of place you'd bring your parents or kids to."}
{"text":"Well I finally convinced my bf to come here and I'm not sure why it has so many good reviews. Yes it's cozy and homey...if you live in a shack.  Seemed not very clean. We sat down and it took ten min for the waitress to offer coffee, which she poured and promptly walked away leaving us with no milk or sugar. Coffee got cold before we could get her attention again. Ordered our meals - my over medium eggs were WAY too runny. His omelette was tiny. The staff seemed generally disorganized and confused. We won't be back which is too bad since it's in a convenient spot."}
{"text":"Our new favourite diner and go-to breakfast for overnight guests. Husband is in love with the french toast and I'm in love with the pancakes. I typically don't order pancakes. They have a bit of a crunchy exterior and fluffy insides, with pockets of warm banana chunks. We tried the blueberry too which is also good and fruit filled, but the banana is by far our favourite.   I've also tried the eggs (overeasy), bacon, rye and home fries. Cooked well, pretty standard, great price (under $5). Home fries aren't excessively packed onto your plate. Portions are great - side of pancakes ought to be shared by at least 3 people.   Service is prompt and pleasant. Coffee was refilled often and we never had to ask. Only thing - staff sometimes responded louder than expected so everyone knew we were ordering yet another side of pancakes."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but I love the pancakes (tried plain and blueberry). my dad has the egg breakfast with peameal and love everything on his plate. The coffee is what you'd expect from a diner, not great but good enough. The service is good as well, everyone is kind and are prompt and always around for coffee refills."}
{"text":"I really like this place... Food and prices are better than good. Lots of options. Friendly service. Is the decor dated? Yes. Is it bustling early in the week? No. But I don't mind. It's a neighbourhood diner doing a great job, at a great price."}
{"text":"For the price, four stars. Basic breakfast - nothing exciting. The sausages tasted like they'd been cooked in old grease. It was hard to get coffee refills, but then again, the coffee was free because it was early in the morning."}
{"text":"Poor service. Food is ok. My boyfriend and I live around the corner and we wanted to try something new for lunch (our breakfast Sunday afternoon). The place was packed and luckily as we walked in there was a table for two. We got seated right away... YET it took a lifetime for someone to at least give us some coffee. My partner and I waited at least 6 minutes... we looked at each other and said another 3 mins and we are walking out... around the 2:49 mark someone arrived and took our coffee order and our meal order. Coffee took a while to arrive. When asked for cream/milk they gave us ONE creamer each.... The coffee was served in a small coffee cup. Later after we finished our first cup of coffee I had to wave down the waitress for a refill...  They weren't very attentive. The food arrived much after. They served us our meals, asked us what else would we like... ummm maybe a fork and knife?.. They said no problem... 5 minutes later no fork and knife... I HAD TO WALK AND GET IT MYSELF. My pancakes were ok. and my bacon was undercooked. My boyfriend got ham and eggs which he said were fine. The staff were not well trained for serving or handling customer service. I will not return."}
{"text":"What a gem! Found this place on my Yelp app. Couldn't believe I got a 3 fried eggs, bacon, toast, and homefries for $4.95 + tax. Ordered orange juice, not sure if it was the freshly squeezed kind but it wasn't super cold, it was almost room temperature but it was okay. That was about $2 a glass. Average price for a breakfast place I guess.  I tipped nearly 40% just because the service was warm and pleasant, super fast, and I thought the super sweet and kind owners deserved something more.  The atmosphere is old school, but in a genuine-and-gawdy old-school way, not a faux-hipster lets-make-these-new-chairs-look-old old-school way.  Lots of old wealthy-looking ladies yelling \"Crystal! Crystal! I want my bill!\" and talking with no filter. Gotta love 'em; their conversations are eavesdrop worthy. I'd go back there just to eavesdrop on patron's updates on their disappointing grandchildren."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, good portions, and good service.   Great place for breakfast, brunch!!  I got french toast which was so good And beef steak it comes with mushroom and veggies and your choice of mashed potato or rice.  Everything taste good and staffs were so friendly.  Would be back soon!!"}
{"text":"It was mentioned below that this place is not fancy, but that the value is hard to beat.  I went for dinner a few days ago, and the place is cheerful, staff is friendly, the food from the eclectic menu is pretty good.  Value, however is great.  The prices are as though this is the 80's.    My only complaint is a lack of Vegetarian options.  This is a nice neighbourhood spot."}
{"text":"Great food, great value, super friendly staff and a nice-homey, neighbourhoody vibe. We live in the bluffs, but it's well worth the drive on Sunday morning for a great brekkie."}
{"text":"My kids love Crystal's place.  Nothing fancy. Typical Breakfasts, Homemade Burgers and Grilled Cheese (which is never grilled, but thats hardly King's Diner's fault), decent fries and soups too.  Reasonable prices, kid friendly. Good coffee, quick to refill.  Kids love walking down for pancakes while Mommy sleeps. Dad can read the paper while they scarf down some pancakes and chocolate milk."}
{"text":"This might be the last place in the city where you can get a classic breakfast (3 eggs, bacon/sausage/ham, toast, homefries and fruit) for less than $5.  The service was friendly and quick, and the food was good. Their homefries were nice and crispy, with seasoning spice on them. The atmosphere is homey... wood chairs and carpetting. It reminds me of an 80s home-cooking restaurant, in a good way.  We'll definitely be back if we're ever in the area again."}
{"text":"A wonderful place. The staff were amazing, so friendly with our children! The food was very good and we would definitely return."}
{"text":"Food is basic but always fresh, well made and tasty. The prices can't be beat and service is prompt and friendly.  This is my favourite go-to place when I need a quick and excellent meal that makes me feel like I visited a friend's place (with a mom that is a great cook!)"}
{"text":"Good food at a quality price. I had their mushroom swiss burger and it was quite nice. The staff are friendly and the decor is nice but with classical music it gives a funeral home sort of feel. all else is good will deffinetly go back."}
{"text":"Any time I have to walk around and find my own utensils, 5min after the food is served, there is a problem. And I wasn't the only one."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a good old breakfast!  Where else can you find these prices? Nothing fancy but it does the trick when you want to feed your belly with a classic breakfast."}
{"text":"Not that great. The potatoes are almost raw and I really like my hash browns. The eggs were okay but a bit on the under done side. The bacon is the cheap kind that you would never buy for your home. The service is really good though. They're nice and the food is really cheap. Because of that, I'll probably go back once in a while but I know what I'll be getting."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try for breakfast this morning as I love a diner breakfast from time to time.  The decor was definitely not what I was expecting, but I loved it - reminded me a small European hotel dining room. We sat up on the balcony level near the bar area.  Service was brisk, a little less friendly than others have noted, but still efficient and polite.  I ordered the Farmer's omelet ($6.95), which was fluffy and came with a generous amount of mushrooms, swiss cheese and onions. Served with a side of home fries, rye toast and a wedge of watermelon.  I found the omelet and the homefries to be a little under-seasoned for my taste, but nothing a little salt didn't fix. My husband ordered the pancakes with bacon ($5.95). The pancakes were as big as my face and nice and fluffy. I can see why kids dig this place.  All-in-all a decent diner breakfast, with very generous portions for the price. Though I wouldn't say it was the best diner breakfast I've come across, I'd certainly come back if I wanted a nice quiet spot for a homestyle breakfast."}
{"text":"It's not fancy, but the value is hard to beat. We get brunch here often on the weekend. For two, it's usually less than $15 all in.  Sandwiches and burgers are pretty good too. Entrees (chicken parm, souvlaki etc) are a little more hit and miss."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to do a review about this place and keep it a secret!  I have been meaning to try this place since seeing their ad in our church bulletin 3 years ago.  Finally, after seeing some Yelp reviews I decided to try it out with my husband and 4 month old.  As some of the reviewers said, it's traditional diner food, with traditional diner prices.  I ordered a corned beef hash and it was only $6.95, and if I had come before 11am, I would have had free coffee or tea.  It's not a large place but we were comfortable, but not sure if they could handle large groups.  The service was fast and friendly and definitely family run.  The food was decent diner fare, and I found it wasn't too greasy either.  My husband ordered three eggs with ham and it came out fine, as one would expect.  Nothing fancy but that's perfect for breakfast.  We paid with cash and tipped more than usual because of the prices being low.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great prices and pretty good brunch. Will definitely be going again for the prices. I didn't like the omelet I decided on (it had tomato sauce and veggies added after the omelet was done and I thought it was all cooked together) but I ate it. My husband got the regular breakfast and it was delicious. There was a bit of a wait for the food and the place was packed. Seemed like a nice family business."}
{"text":"I've walked/driven by this place literally hundreds of time (it's on my way to work) but only recently went in for breakfast with my wife.  The atmosphere is very casual.  Most of the patrons appeared to be families with kids.  The food portion sizes are average.  The service is relatively fast, at the time there were only 2 women who were serving tables and they were very quick.  Don't expect a lot of chit-chat from the staff--they're here to work. After placing our order they came to our table in less then 10 minutes with breakfast--just not ours.  We waited another couple minutes and my breakfast came out, my wife's came out 5 minutes later.  We enjoyed our meal, it was nothing to write home about, but the price was very good--$15 total, including 20% tip and taxes."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  My boyfriend and I were looking for a quick place to grab some breakfast, and Yelp led us here.  King's is a tiny place that only has 8-9 tables. Breakfast is extremely cheap, like $4.95 for 3 eggs, ham, toast and taters cheap. With free coffee. Food was extremely good too and not greasy. I had poached eggs and peameal and my guy had an omelette, the bill came to under $20.   Service was fast too.   The menu is a little quirky, the lunch and dinner food was just a bizarre mix of influences (pasta, burgers, souvlaki, curry and rice, wonton soup)? Probably best you stick with breakfast."}
