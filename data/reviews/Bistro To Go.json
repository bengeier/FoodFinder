{"text":"If there's a party in the Pittsbugh area, Bistro & Company is our only pick! The food is really amazing - fresh, lots of unique flavors and beautifully presented. It does not taste like typical catered food that was made for the masses. Not sure what is in their honey mustard sauce, but it might be the best ever.  The service from Nikki and her team could not be better. Delivery is on time and super friendly. Hosting events can be stressful and we never have to worry about the food!"}
{"text":"We used Bistro To Go to hold a Sunday brunch for our out of town wedding guests. The food was excellent and the location was perfect. I had gone to brunch there before they changed their hours. The server told me the French toast was the best in the city and I laughed. It turns out that he was right! We had to have that for our event. Everything else they prepared was also wonderful. I would definitely recommend using their catering and their space.   Since then, I've stopped by a few times to pick up lunch. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"AMAZING creamy tomato bisque. I am always craving this soup now. The chicken salad sandwich on a crescent roll was a tad disappointing and bland, but still pretty darn good. I love their 1/2 soup and 1/2 sandwich combo, good deal for a delicious lunch, and they are very fast and friendly. Did I mention how cute the place is? Has that make-yourself-at-home feel. Comfortable, clean, affordable and seat-yourself. Definitely recommend the Bistro To Go."}
{"text":"I ordered the stuffed chicken, roast beef, and garlic mashed potatoes for my mothers 80th birthday party.  The service was not only efficient and friendly, but the food was delicious!! My family raved about it all, and wanted to know where it came from!! The roast beef was tender and juicy and the chicken was very tasty!  Thank you Bistro to Go!! The party was a great success!"}
{"text":"I finally made it here and was so glad I did. What an unexpected gem on East Ohio Street, with charming decor and architecture, extremely friendly service, and a delicious array of food.  I felt so welcome from the minute I approached the counter to the minute I left, it was almost like I was visiting someone's home.  While this is somehow listed as \"caterers\" on Yelp, it is definitely open for eating in for lunch or taking out back to the office. I had chicken and a side dish, which were way better than fast food but without the time commitment of a sit-down restaurant. The dining area is a good size and they bring the food to you and apparently just began cleaning up after you as well.   I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a fairly priced lunch or dinner. Food is always hot and good! Staff is pretty friendly too. The cheesy jazz music takes away from the atmosphere, but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"This place was a great addition to the North Side.  Bistro To Go has daily specials, but every Wednesday they have a buffalo chicken mac & cheese dish that is amazing!  It's simply delish.  I ordered a pan of it for a friend's party and let's just say I was the most popular girl in attendance - everyone raved about it :-) The daily specials are a gourmet variety: cod, salmon, pork chops, meatloaf, pasta, etc.  The sides are less exciting, but the cranberry chicken salad is A+.  They have a charming courtyard, which is great for Spring/Summer dining.  The staff is friendly, professional, and accommodating and the atmosphere is airy and light - high ceilings and large windows w/ jazz playing in the background.  The presentation is perfection.  Keep in mind, it's a bistro/gourmet deli...so, not worth a trip across town, but you should most definitely give it a try if your in the vicinity (North Side, Strip District, Downtown, etc.).  You'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I gave my sister a bridal shower in the Bistro Company Room, it was fantastic all thanks to the great decor the food was fabulous and Nikki and Sarah made the affair so stress free. Oscar and his crew was also fabulous. Will be going back to have more parties."}
{"text":"Delicious and helpful! In-house or catering, Bistro has it all.  I love the dishes and the service so much - Bistro catered my son's first and second birthday parties (and probably to his graduation and more!)  Our guests were always happy and if there was any question (even on a Sunday at 1pm) we were given four-star service.   Highly recommend!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is delicious! Catering menu is expansive with a lot to choose from. Very easy to work with for an event, a definite go to if you are a nonprofit looking for catering. If you are looking to grab lunch or work remotely, this is a great place to go. The dining area is cozy and warm with large tables to work."}
{"text":"Really cute & really good lunch spot! Great selection of salads & soups and a changing weekly & daily special menu.   Cute interior that is decorated well and has nice little tables to sit in (including an outdoor space for nice days).   Vegan & gluten free friendly! They have lots of options for both which is a rare find!   Nice looking desserts that I'm going to have to come back to try. Can't wait to return for another lunch!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite lunch spot on the North Side. Disappointed for not having found it earlier! The selection of hot dishes is incredible and have a gourmet feel. Cornbread is unbelievable! Sandwich and salad menu is big and diverse. Service is wonderful and you can tell the owners and chefs have a passion for what they do. The ambience is super cozy too. Could not recommend more strongly!  *PS: PERFECT place to go if you're at the hospital next door or visiting someone there. It's not even a 5 min walk."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food- a short walk from AGH- and worth it!!  Try the turkey dinner, complete with cranberry sauce, for a perfect fall lunch."}
{"text":"Omg... I look forward to my weekly walk to the bank because I get to stop at this gem for lunch , food is made with heart and homemade recipes and the staff is absolutely amazing , def sticks out from all the other options for lunch in the city"}
{"text":"When choosing a caterer for our wedding, we were limited to three choices...  man am I glad Bistro was one of them.  The pros:  Nikki (the owner) is an absolute pleasure to work with.  She was completely willing to modify their standard menus/packages to reach a set-up that met our needs.  We went for two tastings, and both times, we were amazed by both the quality and selection of food (along with our ability to consume and unbelievable amount of food in one sitting... come hungry!).  The catering for our wedding itself was professional, and the food wasn't incredibly different than what we tried at the restaurant (usually not the case).  The cons:  One of our buffet items never made it to the line for the reception.  In addition, there was a mix up with our cake where they didn't cut enough and half of it ended up being left at the hall (ARGH!  the sorrows of wasted burnt almond torte!).  Overall though, Nikki and the catering manager were great about admitting the mistakes and making it up to us, offsetting what would of otherwise been a 3 star review.  Bottom line:  If you're looking for a caterer downtown or in the surrounding area...  Bistro is a great place to go to."}
{"text":"You lost my loyalty at $1.75 for a bag of chips today!  I am willing to pay for a side or extras but this was your typical 50 cents portion, or even the free bag that most places give. I was splitting  the delicious classic bistro sandwich with a friend today and the chips were right by the register.  At first I thought, they were part of the deal and I threw in two with our sandwich purchase.  The total was over $12 but the sandwich was only $8.  I was perplexed so I asked and she told me that it was almost $4 for the chips.  My first thought was to cancel the order but she informed me she already completed the order.  There wasn't a sign on the basket of chips indicating how much they were, if so they wouldn't sell any.  In addition, when I was duped she was pretty much refusing to cancel my order.     I was also excited to find out that the soup of the day was veggie chili.  It was priced accordingly: $3.95, half pint, $6.50 for a pint and $12 for a quart.  I honestly thought she was kidding!! I am by no means a cheap person but there comes a point where you say, why would I ever come back here?  I support new and local businesses but I am also not a fool.  If you don't last, it's because of your outrageous prices not because your food isn't tasty."}
{"text":"The food here is so underwhelming!!!  I left here hungry. I actually settled on this place upon finding out that Legends of the Northshore is closed for lunch on Saturdays.   My boyfriend had lemon pepper tilapia that was dried out and shriveled.  The food doesn't have any flavor. It taste like hospital cafeteria food, the end.  Actually I'd probably be able to get  a better  meal at the Allegheny General Hospital cafeteria."}
{"text":"I too can't say enough good things about Bistro to Go.  We had our wedding at the Mattress Factory in Pittsburgh and everyone is still raving about the food! Nikki worked with me to create a customized menu within my price range.  I also had a vision for the way the food was displayed.  Nikki embraced my vision and executed it perfectly.  I would highly recommend Nikki and her excellent staff for any event.  In addition to catering our wedding we had our rehearsal dinner in her space next door to the Bistro.  Again the food, staff and ambiance was amazing!"}
{"text":"On East Ohio St, friendly place, super nice people working and eating there and a good place to get a wide variety of fresh, healthy and well prepared food.  I love the sandwhich with ham, cheese, green apples and onion on the bread cheese roll.  Staff is always super attentive and pleasant.  Good for vegetarians, comfortable dining room.    Definitely worth going to for lunch and dinner for homestyle classic meals and some well done inventive dishes."}
{"text":"This is strictly a review of a catered box lunch I received at work from Bistro To Go.  We get a lot of leftover catering at work, but Bistro to Go may be my absolute favorite.  They make really cute boxed lunches ($10.95/person) for events!  A few days ago, I indulged in the most amazing Tomato, Basil, and Mozzarella sandwich.  It was served on an Asiago baguette with fresh basil, tomatoes, red onions, buffalo mozzarella and spring mix, drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette.  It was seriously amazing with the big thick slice of mozzarella and the perfect blend of everything else.  It came with a side of Pasta Salad.  While the pasta salad was good and had tomatoes and cucumbers, it uses an Italian vinaigrette, which was quite a bit of vinaigrette including the sandwich.  It was a bit too dressed for my taste but really good nonetheless.  The chips and cookie made a complete meal.  I really never head over to the Northside, but if I do, I will check this place out in person!"}
{"text":"I have to appreciate things that come together without a hitch. Bistro To Go is one of the finest catering services I've ever used. I say that and happily give them five stars for the very reason they are a successful business! Nikki was able to answer any and all questions and allay my anxiety. The food and presentation was exceptional in look and flavor, the staff (a mother and her daughter) I forget their names sorry, were attentive and made us feel very welcome as they not only kept the food stations full and ready they mingled among the family making sure people had everything and knew what was available! Can't thank you all enough, it really did help make our family reunion that much more special! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place!  Came in for lunch with a friend and was immediately impressed by the clean and cozy decor and delicious smells.  There is a set menu of sandwiches/salads that I am sure is worthy of attention, but before I could read more than two words I spotted the case housing the daily specials- meatloaf, crispy chicken, smothered pork chops, chipotle shrimp fettuccine, or gumbo topped with a choice of protein for the entrees along with sweet potato casserole, garlic mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, and cajun greens for the sides.  I decided to go with the meatloaf, sweet potato casserole, and greens and my friend chose the fettuccine, ensuring that we would both be in a nice food-induced coma when we made it back to work.  The food came out within 5-10 minutes and everything was amazing.  All of the food here is made in-house from scratch and to top things off each plate also included a giant, buttery roll.  On top of the great food, the service was outstanding.  Our server was incredibly friendly and was happy to stop and chat with us when we bombarded him with questions about the restaurant.  He also let us walk over to check out the section next door that is Bistro Soul, the catering part of the restaurant.  It looks like it would be a great venue for a smaller event (showers, retirement/anniversary parties, etc.).  Only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the hot entree prices seemed a little bit steep, but all together my food and drink came to a total of $12.75 and completely filled me up.  Also, their sandwich and salad options were a little bit less expensive (I think about $8) so were more comparable to typical chain lunch spots and if they are anything like the hot entrees are much higher quality.    One other definite plus- the drink selections included every single flavor of Boylan Soda (Birch Beer, Cane Soda, Creme Soda, etc etc).  Just add delicious on top of delicious.  They also allow BYOB."}
{"text":"For my wife's birthday we along with nine friends celebrated a delightful evening at Bistro to go on a Friday for their Friday evening tapas.. The only complaint was that it was too much food.  The service and food were outstanding and with BYOB it was incredibly low cost . We all had a great time and would recommend going"}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of food options for folks who work in Allegheny Center.  East Ohio Street can be a scary place with a unique mix of individuals (the fact that there are three pay day loan storefronts is a good indication ).  So it is nice to have a place that is a little nicer and offers variety .    There is a standard menu along with weekly specials.  Items are pre made and displayed and plated and heated when you order.  I've never had a meal here that I didn't enjoy, but I have been disappointed a time or two thinking I would love a dish and then just finding it to meh.  I like their sandwiches better than their hot entrees and you get a nice variety when you do the soup /sandwich combo.  My favorite is the chicken salad.    In the summer they have a cute outdoor seating area.  The unfortunate thing is that it overlooks the previously mentioned East Ohio Street.  It is worth a visit if you work in the area or need a good spot for a lunch meeting, but it isn't someplace to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place!! Quick, quality food and friendly service. Seriously the staff is great!!!   My go to for lunch! Always a great vegetarian option!"}
{"text":"Clean. Quick, friendly service. Great cranberry chicken salad sandwich.  Nice atmosphere.  Customer friendly.    Restrooms impeccable."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times and the food is always delicious! I always leave full and happy I stopped by. I have also gotten a breakfast catered from here. The French toast was amazing! Everything was packed up and ready to go when I arrived to pick it up. I'll come here again and also get more events catered by them."}
{"text":"I came to Bistro-to-Go for the weekend brunch buffet, and it was very good. Eggs, bacon sausage, omelet station, and lots more. They also had pastries and self-serve juice and coffee. Plus, the staff is super nice and the decor is eclectic and fun.   I wouldn't say you should search out this breakfast buffet since it was only above average, but it is a great place if you're looking for something different for breakfast.  I'm also planning to head back for their lunch and dinner selections- the menu looks good and I expect the ingredients to be fresh."}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe with great food! perfect for a weekday lunch!   The service was quick and the people are friendly! As regulars, they call you by first name which is a huge plus and definitely hard to find in the service business nowadays! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Food use to be better. Also give you very flimsy/cheap plastic \"silverware\" now. For the money they charge- I would expect better."}
{"text":"SETTING: Quaint and cute, like I was dining at an Inn or Bed & Breakfast. Bistro to Go is one of those cafes with a cozy atmosphere, perfect for a rainy or snowy day. Medium sized place with tables for mostly small parties (2-4 people).   FOOD: Came for Sunday brunch. We thought there was a brunch buffet, but that is no longer the case here. Got the french toast with two sides (bacon and scrambled eggs). Both sides were done well, nothing super special. However, the french toast--this was what made the dish mouth-watering.    I couldn't really pin point the fantastic flavors I tasted, but the french toast seemed to have a hint of cinnamon and pumpkin/pecan (or something??) with syrup drizzled on top. I couldn't figure out the taste, but I did know the french toast was delicious.   SERVICE: Extremely kind people and staff. Did not laugh at our confused faces when answering our questions regarding the case of the missing Sunday brunch :(.   IMPRESSIONS:  I enjoyed the brunch. It's pretty typical brunch fare that is done well (get the french toast!), but what really stood out to me was the atmosphere. It's not too crowded, it's quiet, and it's a cute place with great customer service. This gives Bistro to Go an automatic leg up compared to other brunch spots that tend to be noisy and over packed--with people glaring at you in hopes you eat faster so they could get a turn at your table. I don't handle that kind of pressure well. Here, you can take your time. If you're looking for a nice sit-down brunch place to relax and take things slow, this is your spot.   Again, no breakfast buffet unless it's a special occasion like Mother's Day. I don't think they changed this info on the website though, hence our confusion."}
{"text":"Generous portions of quantity and quality. Restaurant quality, faster than fast food, and at $8 for a huge sandwhich, it beats the nearby Subway in taste, price, and atmosphere. It's literally cheaper than Subway, at least it can be. Because you can also splurge and get a dinner plate of preprepared entrees and sides that rotate every day, but always having the sandwhiches as a fallback.   Also, they have a very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Came here for a bridal shower for my sister. The space is very nice and intimate for a bridal shower setting. They let you decorate how ever you want and the staff was very friendly. The food was great we did a brunch bridal shower menu. Before they let us do a tasting and they have many vegetarian options. We had the frittata with and without potatoes. It was very flavorful. They also had crab cakes with a lemon dill sauce. Very fresh and mini turkey Ruben sandwiches. Those went very fast and everyone loved them. The fruit salad was fresh and flavorful. We also brought our own cupcakes and they set them up nice on a tray for us. They are open during the week and have a regular menu. They are also catering my sisters wedding that is having 200 people so they are capable to do large parties!! Can't wait for the wedding food"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about Bistro to Go! Have used their catering for many events and it is top notch. All of the staff are courteous and professional- you can tell they take great pride in their work and delivering the best quality. In addition to catering, you can go inside the quaint restaurant to dine in or take food to go. They have a standard menu and also a weekly menu that is posted on their website. Highly recommend this venue!"}
{"text":"We ordered catering from Bistro To Go.  Wow!!! Everything these guys did was A+!!!  The food looked awesome!!    It tasted amazing!!  They got rave reviews on EVERYTHING!!!  They knocked it out of the park!!  We really appreciate all the attention to detail.  I know it took them a lot more time but it really made a difference.  A solid 10/10 !!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the greatest comfort food/southern kitchen. Their soups, sandwiches, and salads are amazing. I also fancy their homemade buffalo chicken mac & cheese... The staff is so friendly. Great place for lunch, sunday brunch, or a quick bite for dinner.   Not really a sit-down place. There are several tables and they will bring your food out to you once you order at the counter."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch before I went to the airport. Thought we had come to the wrong place, but little did I know. By day, this place is a caterer. By weekend, it's a full service traditional breakfast/brunch buffet. The food is exceptionally prepared, and I was wanting of nothing when there.  There were all the traditional breakfast items: scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, hash browns, french toast... etc. There's an omelette bar as well, where one of the chef's will make an omelette to your choosing. There's also plenty of pastries, bagels, and fruit as well.  Each dish is prepared very professionally, where I can tell that quality counts. The french toast does not taste like mass produced french toast, rather individually battered and grilled french toast. It's simply delicious.  There is cranberry and OJ, and if you pour 2/3 OJ and 1/3 Cranberry, you get a delightful drink that is greater than the sum of its parts.   Overall, I don't want to shoot myself in the foot with this place. It's definitely a gem, and I don't want it to get overcrowded, because the food here is prepared to an excellence as befitting its catering reputation. However, I feel guilty keeping this place to the select few that know about it.  So go, and enjoy."}
{"text":"We were on E Ohio Street for another appointment and decided to add lunch nearby to our agenda. This place was convenient and the food was good, with lots of nice options. The salads take a bit extra long to construct as compared to the prepared foods, so the food ends up coming out at different times."}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us went to Bistro to Go last Sunday for a birthday brunch.  The staff is so friendly and helpful and the food was delicious.  The highlight of my meal was the french toast but everything was great.   I have eaten on the other side as well and that food is amazing there too.  We also had our wedding catered from here a few years back and people raved about the food but that is a different story :).  They have a cute little outside space in between both restaurants with plants and cute hanging lights.  It's also byob so we enjoyed some mimosas on this beautiful Sunday morning.  I don't normally do reviews but felt it was my duty to share the good word about this place.  Go check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say it was the friendliest and nicest customer service I've had in a Pittsburgh restaurant in a really long time.  Kudos to the staff, I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. You either get something really really good or something you'd rather not talk about again. My first time here I wasn't impressed and the second time I went with a co-worker and had a country fried chicken with Mac and cheese and I'm a snob when it comes to both of those things and it tasted so comforting. I enjoyed every bite and it made me want to fall asleep at my desk. Today I gave it a go and tried their New Orleans Gumbo and it left little to be desired. I asked the polite lady behind the counter if it was spicy and she said yes only for me to get back to my desk and it was barely seasoned let alone spicy. Next time they have the fried chicken and Mac and cheese I will most definitely be there. I love that they change their menu up every day. I also enjoy their rolls. The rolls alone make up anything else on your plate.  Would I eat here again? Maybe! Would I make this a regular lunch spot? Probably not! The staff is nice and sometimes you get some really good food. And they also have a Coke Freestyle machine which is awesome sauce."}
{"text":"I recently chose Bistro To Go as the caterer of our company picnic. They were very easy to work with for ordering and a wide range of options - not just the boring catering lasagna and chicken. We had them deliver to the house where the event was held, they set up everything very quickly, gave us everything we needed, and were on their way!  Our guest LOVED the food. The hummus and dip spread was a hit with all kids and adults. The salmon had a yummy dressing. The burgers went quickly. The salad was fresh and the homemade dressing went perfectly with it. The one item people are still talking about it the black bean croquettes with spicy ranch. I have a co-worker even trying to find the recipe! Oh - and the pricing was very reasonable for the amount of food we ordered. Portions are pretty large, so either weigh your options of ordering less or preparing for leftovers!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! Work nearby, it's great to find a place that is guaranteed to be fresh and delicious. Inside is super adorable and cozy. Love the ceilings! Looks very clean, it's nice that they prepare the food in view of the customers. Have eaten here multiple times, have yet to find something I didn't like. It would be nice to have more meal deals. The only thing they really offer is a half sandwich and a cup of soup. Would like more options like that, but still delicious!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick bite between stops while visiting family. I actually ended up next door at Bistro Catering for Sunday brunch. The French Toast was as delicious as promised (don't miss the sauce!), and the (owner? manager?) I talked with was super nice. I'll definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Bistro To Go is my favorite lunch spot on the North Side! I used to work nearby, and had gone at least one time a week. Unfortunately, due to a job change, I will not be able to continue going as often as I would like. The staff is friendly and the food comes out really fast. For someone who has some dietary restrictions, this place has been a saving grace for me! I've never tried any of the prepared food options I haven't liked, and the made-to-order salads and sandwiches are fantastic as well. This review is long overdue -  I highly recommend Bistro To Go!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and found that they serve homey food in a very relaxed atmosphere. The prices are pretty good, but this is a place I tired of because it is very homey and I can cook like this so why go out. Went for the sunday brunch that was advertised in an e-mail and was disappointed.It wasn't a brunch, only a breakfast with nothing spiecial. The eggs I asked for over medium were cooked over easy which means runny whites, so I couldn't eat them. The sides were mostly cold. The potatoes were good tasting but cold. The bacon was either raw or burnt and again cold. I didn't try the sausage or the french toast because I was afraid it was cold. The other thing that bothers me is that every buffet that I've been to has you use a clean plate every time you go get food and this place gives you one plate to use over and over. This means that if you use ketchup on your eggs and potatoes then you get ketchup on your sweet roll and fruit, yuck! There are better places to go for the money."}
{"text":"This is a neat little spot to pick up a quick lunch. Nicely decorated interior and outdoor patio seating as well. The menu changes weekly. I'm a fan of the tomato bisque, wedding and chicken/noodle soup. Grabbed grilled kielbasa with a side of mashed potatoes and it was good though $9 is a little pricey. Small cup of soup will run you $5 and $7 for a bowl."}
{"text":"I have passed this place for years! Stationed over in the north side for training and I wish I've been going everyday. Or not, bc seriously, this apple cheddar bacon sandwich is kind of ruining me for all other sandwiches. It is delicious, everything on the menu looked good, THERE WAS A HO HO CAKE and the girl at the register was genuinely nice and like, excited to help me with bread choices. Definitely a place to visit for lunch if you're over this way and I will keep it in mind for any catering."}
{"text":"My time here was short and my order was small but I was very impressed with the whole experience!  Service is EXTREMELY friendly, with everyone greeting you, asking how you are, if you need anything and just plain being nice.  I love that!  Plus, the \"to go\" is represented well with fast and prompt delivery of the goods... the food I mean!  I was craving a chicken salad sandwich and surprise, it was on the menu as a raspberry almond chicken salad served on a croissant.  Done!  The salad part was very tasty, with enough mayo to satisfy my saucy needs, but not too little to make it dry.  The croissant was so moist and buttery.  It wasn't firm by any means, so the sandwich kinda fell apart.  It didn't matter tome though because it was VERY good!    I loved the help yourself iced tea as well.  They had two different kinds, a sweetened peach and regular unsweetened tea.  The peach was incredibly sweet so I mixed the two and it was just perfect.    I can't wait to go back and order up more items on their menu and also stop by Bistro Soul that's connected to this one.  And try this wonderful $10 brunch buffet I've heard so much about!"}
{"text":"We had Bistro To Go cater a bridal shower for about 48 guests in Pittsburgh.  I was planning from out of town, but staff was very helpful on the phone.  They recommended the perfect amount of food for the number of guests.  The food was excellent--we had sandwiches, salad, and pierogies--not fancy but much nicer than your average deli spread.  Price is great for what you get.  One slip--they forgot to include the vegetarian sandwiches I ordered--but the guy who delivered returned in 20 minutes with a whole tray of them.  Would most definitely use them again to cater a daytime, informal event in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We had the Southern Seafood Gumbo and Seafood Lasagna for a big, late Friday lunch. Delicious. And the service is friendly and very accommodating. We'll be back. A lot."}
