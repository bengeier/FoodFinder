{"text":"I recently moved back to Ohio after living in Arizona for the past, well, let's just say it's been a long time.  Anyway, there was a place in Arizona that had chicken and waffles and I was curious if there was anything like that around here.  Well, didn't find much on here before and it just so happpened that yesterday my Mom, Aunt and - were out and about checking out some specialty grocers on the westside and while checking out the old neighborhoods and low and behold, near the intersection of Lee Rd and Libby, I see Mr. Wonderful's.    Well my Mom and Aunt thought I was a little nuts when I said how good chicken andwaffles were and now I know where to come back and try.  Well, next thing I know we are pulling into the parking lot.  Yeah, how exciting.  Huge menu!  Awesome choices!  Eat there in the decent sized, very clean dining area or take out.  We ate there.    We each ordered the 1 waffle with 4 tenders and of course had to get the Sweet Jesus glaze on the chicken.  When the food arrived, it was nice and hot.  4 sectioned belgain waffle with the Sweet Jesus glazed tenders on top along with hot syrup.  Well, I was in heaven and my Mom and Aunt were pleasntly surprised.    While we savoring our food, a gentleman, who I assume was an owner came over and asked how we were enjoying our food.  Told him very much so!  he asked if we had tried the honey bun cheesecake.  Told him no, that this was our first visit.  Well, next thing you know, he brought a piece over for us to try.  OMG!  Amazing!  it reminded me of a cinnamon crumb coffee cake.  The cheesecake was smooth and not too tangy like some can be.  Will so go back again and try some of their other menu items.  The dirty fries sound delish."}
{"text":"This a great neighborhood restaurant, the service is great the is always cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this place is awesome. Call ahead as they cook to order and it takes about 20 mins. Don't forget the sweet jesus glaze omg that's the reason"}
{"text":"Everything but the ribs are good. I enjoy going there, because its just around the corner. Staff are polite, and they do their best to please the customer. Love the gospel music playing in the background, and how clean the establishment is. Wish they had good ribs, because they would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great little hometown restaurant, but I ordered a catfish sandwich and it was nothing but a piece of catfish and 2 slices of bread.  No sauce, veggies or anything else, just dry bread.  The catfish was very delicious, thus the three stars.  But the presentation and the flavor and texture was lacking.  Maple Heights is a quaint hometown type place near Cleveland and I was passing through."}
{"text":"I am new to the area. So trying out new restaurants is a must. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles with the Sweet Jesus sauce! Wow, what a hit! I look forward to heading back to explore more yummy goodness. The staff was friendly and the food was prepared as ordered."}
{"text":"I used to pass this place all the time. Its really close to home but it never dawned on me to check it out. I always go to the 7-11 thats a hop skip and a jump away but only read the title to this location. I honestly only came here because some friends told me it was amazing so i had to try it for myself.   The chicken wings here was medium size with a nice flavor. The waffles were made with a homemade style batter. The food took an extremely long time to finish cooking. The cajun fries looked meh as they were regular thick cut fries with cajun flavor on them. Other than the waffle, the only thing that really stood out here to me was the Jar of Super Sweet Kool-Aid.   Not gonna say i would never go here again because there some more menu items i wanna try but i wont put in any extra effort to get here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is always on point and the service and staff is amazing."}
{"text":"I usually love this place. Have been coming for YEARS. literally since it opened. Yet last night I had the worst experience. I ordered a grilled chicken salad. The salad was terrible too much cheese , only veggies on the salad was tomatoes and lettuce. Wtf terrible. I will never order a salad from here again. It's sad when you can't get a healthy salad.  So the only reason I gave 3 stars was bc of the history I have with this place. Bc if it was solely based on last night it would have been 1 star."}
{"text":"Interesting place to say the least, the wait was longer than I would have like, but the food, was spectacular. The Sweet Jesus Glaze in half if the chicken was well worth it crispy cooked well, not dripping with grease. The Carolina gold sauce is tangy, the BBQ Is sweet. I recommend calling ahead to get you food, as well as getting a jar of peach mango kool-aid."}
{"text":"First time here. Got the sweet Jesus chicken and waffles, and it was amazing! Friendly service, super clean place. Loved it!"}
{"text":"A coworker took me here for lunch recently and advised me to get the 4 piece dinner with the 'sweet jesus' sauce, and it was fantastic. The establishment was pretty clean and everything seemed to be made to order. I'd probably try to call ahead if I was doing take-out since it took a good 10-15 minutes to prepare. The mac & cheese and rice/gravy sides were a little underwhelming, but the chicken was to die for. I overheard a lot of people getting the collard greens as a side, and would probably try that next time. Overall very good."}
{"text":"My nephew and I ate here on a whim after talking about food while playing grand theft auto. They had a chicken place in the game and it wasn't beyond breakfast. So why not combine both?  First time here we had to get.......Yes, you guessed it chicken and waffles.  Does the combo sound bad, yes kinda depends on who you ask. I was ready for my tummy to be upset. So we get 2 pieces and 1 waffle since we were unsure. We ate at home since it was close by. We pour our syrup and hot sauce on our food annnnnnnnnnnnd IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!  Score one for the odd couple of food, we both thought it was a very delicious lunch to have the best of breakfast and dinner combined into one awesome power couple of yummy.  So say yes to chicken and waffles, it will surprise you!"}
{"text":"First off, when I got out of my car I was overcome by weed smoke from some young guys outside smoking RIGHT BY THE ENTRANCE!!! Next, when I went in I ordered a polish boy. I paid and I asked how long the wait would be and I was told 22 minutes....for a HOT DOG????? I asked for my money back...because honestly who in the world has time to wait that long and they weren't even crowded!!! Maybe it was all of the weed smoke making them move slowly. The woman at the register gave me my money back and beside her was a guy shaking  his head at ME in disgust. I asked him why he was doing that and he said \"fuck it\" under her breath. I told him this experience and his attitude are why African American businesses don't often thrive. That was my first AND LAST TIME GOING THERE."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. I have always felt welcomed. Clean dining area, serving area and restrooms. Staff appear clean and are respectful. I came in for lunch and was waiting for a friend to discuss a project. We were sitting for several hours with no issues or requests to leave. Obviously they were not requiring our table at that time."}
{"text":"Their waffles are amazing! They're not your typical buttermilk waffles. They have a warm spice that makes you feel like like it's autumn all year round. I got the Chicken & Waffles and my boyfriend got the Chicken Philly with Dirty Fries. The food was great and a pretty decent price. The staff was helpful and the food was done pretty fast. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I got the chicken and waffles with the sweet Jesus sauce. Omg To Die For. This place has been kept clean and the staff is friendly and helpful and knowledgeable with the menu."}
{"text":"I ordered the perch and shrimp dinner with two sides; the shrimp were the cheap frozen butterfly Shrimp; the perch were 3 small pieces that equal 1 large piece; mac N cheese was fair. Also ordered 10 wings and fry, Wings were very small; they should have gave 20 wings to make up for the small size. They are buying the cheapest products and selling them for a premium price. Perch dinner and wing dinner came to $30. Didn't get tarter sauce, hot sauce. Did get a fork and napkins. Person packing my meal pants were sagging and showing his underwear. Food wasn't great. I want be back!"}
