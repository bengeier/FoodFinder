{"text":"One of the few halal indian restaurants with asian/chinese options included aswell. Delicious food with humble decor and reasonable prices.

Would recommend the spicy biryani (make sure to mention them to make it spicy).

One of the few places that actually fulfills my indian food craving without tasting watered down or bland like most places."}
{"text":"I was excited at the prospect of Chinese Indian in montreal. After Dosas it was the thing I missed the most from back home in Bangalore where some would argue you have the best Chindian restos. I went to some in Jersey and they were amazing.
I ordered Salateen to go, so please factor that in my review. 
I ordered the manchurian chicken, 1 chicken fried rice, and mixed platter (small). Total was $38!!!!
Rice was tasteless and very dry (might have been better if I ate there). Portion was ok here.
Manchurian had that taste so flavoring was right but portion was tiny. Chindian portions are usually abundant. 
MIxed platter was decent but nothing Sana (on Jarry) can't pull off for half the price.
 
I am a pretty good cook but cannot manage making Chindian. If someone out there reads this and can cook this stuff, please open a resto. I will bring clients by the dozens. It's the one thing I hate about Montreal, not having that deep fried fix.
There is one thing that really says Chindian for me, that vinegar with chillies they serve as a condiment doused over chicken Hakka noodles...Not happening here.

Soooo disappointed."}
{"text":"Only tried the Palak Paneer, that was very good, along with very good nan.
Service can be iffy, but food is good.
Chicken Biryani takeout always seems to be at a very special low price.

Overall, worth the trek to this far-off un-touristy area for decent Indian/Pakistani food at very good prices."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Just regretted going there. We got our order after 45 minutes!  And when we got it the biryani was cold which is supposed to be piping hot to be able to enjoy it.  The nihari was just soup without taste. We just wanted to finish our food and we promised ourselves never to go back! The food was not up to the mark considering the competition in that area and a little too expensive for the typical Indian restaurant. We paid the woman at the counter and later realized that she had charged us $10 extra. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"We were recommend Restaurant Salateen by some family friends and decided to give it a try. Now my expectations of Indian/Pakistani cuisine is extremely high, as I am quite accustomed to it so we usually avoid the more 'commercial' type ones and only go if we are sure it is authentic!

Located in the famous Jean Talon district, that is well-known for its selection of Indian cuisine, Salateen is a small and cosy 'typical Indian restaurant' looking place. It is fairly clean and comfortable.
We were recommended their Indo-Chinese selection which is what we intended on having. It is difficult to find 'Hakka Chinese' in Montreal - Chinese food with a spicier side. 
We started with the Hot & Sour Soup - this was amazing! I only expected it to be a spicy vegetable soup but it had chicken and the texture was absolutely delicious. It tasted almost like Tom Yum that I was addicted to in Singapore/Malaysia so I am definitely coming back for this!
We also had the chicken pakoras - these were good, tasty with a lot of food colouring (bright orange) but the pieces of chicken were quite small. Usually these are big chunky pieces but here they were bite-sized with a lot of fat. However, we devoured them and would probably order again.
For our main course, we had chicken noodles, beef schezwan and naan bread. I really enjoyed everything and found the portions a decent large size. This was definitely enough for two people. The noodles were delicious but the schezwan could have been better. It was more like a beef curry than a corn-starchy schezwan - was not impressed by this. My husband however, loved the fact it was more a curry-base and gobbled it all up with the soft, fluffy naan bread. The naan is definitely authentic, tandoor-baked naan which is a must-have!
We shared a mango lassi on the side (lassi is usually too heavy to have with meals) and it was perfectly made.

The biggest downside for us was the behaviour of their staff. I found them too eager when we entered and then stood not far from our table watching us as we ate. It was quite daunting. There was a new girl working and she made a mistake by placing rice on our table. Usually, the schezwan dishes are meant to come with rice so we thought it was included and my husband began to take some. After a few moments, another waitress came by and grabbed the plate and said it wasn't for us and that the girl had made a mistake. Her attitude was very rude and I feel she could have done this more tactfully. 

Overall, delicious and authentic food-wise but service could be improved"}
{"text":"This restaurant is under new administration, I ordered the regular hot and sour soup and it had no veggies in it anymore, just broth for 3.99! Chicken tikka masala was served as chicken butter!! and the sizzling plate was so so DRY, had to ask them to take it away. And when I mentioned to the waitress she just made a weird face. I'm disappointed since I was craving the hot and sour soup. I will unfortunately not go back."}
{"text":"Service is way toooo slow, but the food is always fresh and delicious. Its my all the time to go indian/chinese/pakistani restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been craving for Indian-Chinese food (Also known as Hakka Cuisine or Desi Chinese) since I came to Montreal and was surprised that these kinda restaurants are almost non existent here. Browsing through pages on yelp I found a review of Salateen by  Montreal Yelp CM, the awesome Risa D. It said that Salateen does offer Desi Chinese food. So off I go to the Parc & Jean Talon area.  Located just a block away from Parc Metro is Restaurant Salateen. Looks like any other Indian restaurant in the Parc area. Nothing special. The Ambiance..... Its a dining hall with 10 tables, a tv that's playing some south asian stuff......But you are at an Indian restaurant in the Park and JT locality. If you are here I assume that you are here for the reasonably priced food, period. The place looks clean. That's what matters. The Salateen menu has 2 sections. Indian food & Desi chinese. I haven't tried the Indian menu as my intention was to go for Hakka menu. So I ordered Chicken Manchurian, Schezwan Chicken, Veg fried rice & Chicken Noodles. Honestly I was expecting the food to be mediocre as this was the only restaurant that serves this kinda food and there's no competition in the city. I was WRONG. The food was delicious. The Manchurian was very flavorful & the Schezwan had a nice zing to it. Fried rice was good. Its not the regular fried rice you get at Chinese places. This is made with Basmati rice. So its very fluffy and has a nice aroma. The Noodles were good. A bit greasy, but in a good way. Definitely worth a visit.


Food -  Really Good
Service - Ok
Ambiance - Place looks Clean
Worth the money - Hell Yeah"}
{"text":"Just got back from a friendly quiet dinner at Salateen at the recommendation of one wise Noah B. We ordered off the Desi Chinese menu - that's an Indian take on Chinese food, a well-established flavour kingdom in the universe of Indian food that supposedly comes from the small Chinese community originally in Calcutta. I only know this because I looked it up after enjoying the subtle mix of spices, I don't have much experience to compare the good eats at Salateen to, but I know I enjoyed them. 

The garlic beef noodles and szechuan fish were my favourites tonight, both dishes tasted fresh, light and spicy. We ordered four dishes, had a bunch of leftovers and paid $15 each, so this was definitely affordable. The room was clean and comfortable though it was empty when we got there it filled up with neighbourhood locals as we ate, everyone greeted sweetly by our waitress who gave good recommendations and prompt service. The food didn't blow my ears off but I really really really liked it and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Indian & Chinese food?? You already know this place is not legit. Not only are the reviews on the chinese menu are horrendous but we ordered their butter chicken today.... if you cannot even perfect butter chicken how can you call yourself an Indian restaurant? Worst butter chicken ever. We failed to search this place up for reviews before ordering and are full of regrets. Google reviews of people who got food poisoning from this place as well. The butter chicken was bland and watery. The only reason they get 1 star is for the NAaan bread which is decent."}
{"text":"This portion of Jean-Talon Ouest is definitely known for its Indian and Pakistani restaurants and businesses. We recently discovered Sana Tandoori Palace after playing at Parc Jarry and then walked the short distance to this neighborhood in search of a new Indian restaurant to patronize. We are so glad we tried the Sana Tandoori Palace. The food is delicious and the prices will make you believe that you are in Bombay. The chana samosas are crispy and filled with delicious goodness. The tandoori chicken is cooked to perfection. There is a huge selection of different kinds of naan... chicken, qeema, garlic, tandoori. We recommend the beef curry... there are yummy bits of ginger in a garlicky and delicious sauce and the best part... it is only $8 and enough to feed 4 people."}
{"text":"Came here after a long drive from Pittsburgh, PA to be slightly disappointed. Food doesn't really stand out in quality and the decor is atrocious. Wouldn't ever come back but would I'd tell people to give it a shot. 

as we entered there's a sense of disarray. Random blinds in the back of the place, posters from from Ramadan 2016 (which was 2 months ago), random buffet cart, exposed wiring on the floor, carpet looked as though it hadn't been vacuumed in weeks, and some light bulbs seemed to be out.

Sure that's very picky of me but after a long drive into a very diverse city, especially the street it's located on, you'd expect better. 

So we ordered the food and immediately encountered a problem. A member in our party couldn't eat spicy due to a stomach problem, so we told the waitress to make one of the dishes not spicy at all. We saw her write it down and heard her say it to the back... The dish was perfect except the fact that there was a noticeably large amount of red chili flakes mixed in the noodles (Item in dispute was chicken chow mein). Eventually we had to ask for several bowls of yogurt to help him eat his meal. 

The rest of us shared a large mixed grill platter w/several naans which was above par but nothing exceptional."}
