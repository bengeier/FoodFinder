{"text":"To preface, I must admit that the reason why I'm about to give Cacao 70 such a blah review is because I built my expectations up so high from reading all the wonderful reviews on urbanspoon and yelp.   So I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how warm the ambiance was. I liked the large open kitchen and the wooden counters. I liked the fairy lights and the spacious seating area.   My friend and I were lethargically greeted and seated by a guy who looked like he wanted to just get out of there. My friend got the Cioccolata Calda (Italian-style Hot Chocolate) and I got the %70 Fleur de Cao which was different than her's which was hot chocolate where as mine was cocoa based. We also ordered the Cacao 70's Cheesecake.   The drinks came and they were actually really delicious. I have to say that I've never had hot chocolate/cocoa this good. They were rich and thick and creamy. If anyone has seen that scene in the film Chocolat when Vianne is pouring cocoa into the cup for Armande and it's perfectly dense and rich... well that's how our hot cocoa/chocolate was. I liked her's more, it did have quite a thicker consistency, allowing her to drink with a spoon. I wish mine also came in a cup instead of a  fishbowl-like glass which made it hard to drink from since it was quite hot after pouring in the cocoa. It also detracted from the warmness that you should feel from drinking cocoa, I feel.   But what I didn't like...well a lot actually. First the price. I'm sorry but $8-10 for hot chocolate? Really? Sure it was really good, but I'm not used to paying so much for hot chocolate. Secondly, the cheesecake. Presentation wise, I'd give it a 1.  It gets 1 point for drizzling red raspberry sauce on the plate, ok fine another point for nice cut strawberries. Otherwise, it really seemed like they scooped (yes scooped) the rest of the cheesecake that was left and plopped in on our plate, smothered it with whipped cream and called it a night. It must have been some excellent quality whipped cream that we were paying for then because that's mostly what we ate. The little bit of cheesecake I guess was okay.  We couldn't finish our drinks because we were too full. I don't think there will be a next time for me but I'd recommend just getting either a dessert or drink. The drink would've been satisfactory for me. Whatever you do, just don't get the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Sunday brunch.  Both the food and service were excellent.  We were seated as soon as we arrived and for the entire meal the service was fast. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and answered all our questions. The menu is full of choices, so we will have to return again and again. Our crepe was very good and came with an \"appetizer\" of fruit and chocolate dip... a nice touch.  The granola with fruit, yogurt and chocolate drizzle was also very tasty. We highly recommend Cacao 70, but time your visit carefully, it can get very busy."}
{"text":"Needed a caffeine boost so I stopped by with my mom-in-law.   The Mocha Frape (iced) was delicious, maybe the best iced coffee drink I've ever had. I could taste the strong notes of espresso blended with vanilla ice cream and dark chocolate - customers can pick between milk or dark chocolate, and I much prefer dark.  My mom-in-law had the mocha (she also picked dark chocolate) and it was rich and delicious.  Would def recommend the place and return here myself!"}
{"text":"Was originally directed to a poor table next to the cash, asked for window, then was asked to move from it.  Ordered a vegetarian sandwich; sliced tomatoes and spinach, chunky-melty white stuff."}
{"text":"The chocolate offerings which we sampled (100% and 55% hot chocolates, single dark fondue) were \"A-OK\". I might even say that the hot chocolate was a pleasant surprise. My girlfriend ordered a house special crêpe - it was also acceptable. Not too impressive, but surpassed passable, considering that this is a specialty chocolate spot.  The staff were hard-working and pleasant. The environment was busy, a touch cluttered, but comfortable.  The sole detracting factor of this location was the abundant presence of fruit flies. We were swatting away at our food and drink during the entire experience. It's March...  Final note: at the time of our visit, their Internet was failing intermittently."}
{"text":"Fast service, but poor preparation. The waiters and waitresses are quick, attentive, but the food wasn't fully cooked.   The staff are reluctant to offer any adjustment to the bill if you aren't satisfied. Keep this in mind when dining here. You may not get what you expect, but you'll still pay full price."}
{"text":"Sat down to have dessert with my wife today, cheesecake for me and crepe for her. The coffee was decent and the food was OKay. There was one little problem: fruit flies on the coldest day of the winter. That was it. Two or three fruitflies and we complained to the manager who didn't charge us for a partially eaten meal. She did ask my wife to pay for the coffee which we refused. Of course, If you see flies in this weather, it.means there is something wrong with the cleanliness in the kitchen. I also noticed there was an accumulation of furry dust on the walls which is off putting but the place was filled with eager customers. Go figure. Anyways, hygiene should be the utmost factorbin operating an eating establishment. We will never return."}
{"text":"Cacao 70 not only sells dessert...they have a full on brunch menu available until 4pm. Their portions are huge, just like their desserts, so it is well worth visiting!  The cafe's menu is a bit on the pricey side for dessert, but I forgive them because their portions are quite big and I would really do anything for chocolate.  The Milton & Parc location is very spacious, with lots of tables and booths for everyone. There is a permanent table for 8.  Brunch: When you order from their brunch menu, they offer a plate of fruits & chocolate fondue! We didn't realize they did until they brought it to us, but it was a really nice surprise. Because the fondue isn't the main dish, the chocolate is a lot less, but the amount of fresh fruit that they give you is so abundant!  Our portions were so big that neither of us finished it on the spot. As for the taste, I think it tasted pretty decent... very healthy. My frittata was a bit bland for my taste, but still nevertheless very good.  Cacao 70's strong pursuit is definitely their sweet stuff; their brunch menu is alright. Nothing overly extraordinary, but not too bad either. I especially love that they offer a side of fresh fruit with chocolate fondue.  Onto their sweet menu: Nutella Ricotta Cheese Pizza - The pizza tasted great; you really can't go wrong with nutella! The taste of ricotta cheese wasn't very strong, which was a little disappointing, because all I could taste was nutella. But I think using ricotta cheese was a smart idea because the cheese is a good mediator; whipping cream would've been too much and ice cream would've made the pizza way too sweet. The ricotta cheese has texture to it and allows the sweetness of nutella to really be the main focus of the pizza. The fruits and chocolate sauce given is a nice touch, to personalize your slice of pizza just the way you want it."}
{"text":"Hot chocolate was great. Italian one was not as thick as we expected but yummy none the less. The volcano ice cream cup was below average - exactly what you'd find at any normal chain restaurant. Hard brownie, hodgepodge of sauces on top, nothing brining it all together. Very disappointing. Wasted most of it."}
{"text":"Café Resto sympa au village ! Ma crêpe fraises choco un délice et service agréable. Décoration en bois et chaleureux. Les 2 employés m ont très bien reçu. Ai retrouvé une touche française. Je reviendrai à coup sur."}
{"text":"A wide selection of everything chocolate you can think of! From brownies to fondue, from hot chocolate to cakes. We were a group and we ordered of bunch of stuff. Everything tasted wonderful and full of flavor. One of my friends described it like he hit a new high. Their hot chocolate was so thick, so it tasted like melted chocolate. The fondue was awesome with so many food combinations. The cheesecake tasted so good. On top of this, pricing was fair. Overall, a great place to sample some of the best chocolate desserts."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, surprisingly good. I had the frittata which came with fruit and chocolate. My girlfriend had the granola bowl and enjoyed it. The smoothies are are also good but expensive. 6$ for a glass is a bit much.  It is good for 2-4 people and there is wifi. The usual chocolate desserts are really good, it is always full so you might have to wait in line."}
{"text":"Great brunch. The vegetable frittata was a favorite for our group as well as the crepes. Good service. The only alcohol they offer is red stripe beer so no mimosa options but the coffee was great. We returned for brunch again :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a chocolate banana shake and the vegetarian sandwich.   The shake was quite good, with a rich dark chocolate and banana taste.   The sandwich was terrible. For $10 it was a couple of flaps of bread, some poor tasting spinach, a couple tomatoes and two tiny pieces of cheese. I've unfortunately had cheaper, better sandwiches from pit stops on the highway.   I'm giving this place a 3 because the deserts look excellent (and the shake was quite good), the atmosphere was nice, and there is plenty of seating for larger groups.   I would avoid their regular food menu and stick to their deserts."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service but excellent food.  All the food came out in parts. E.g., I ordered a waffle with an egg on the side. The waffle came first and 20mins later came the egg separately.   The menu is large and there are plenty of choices.   All in all, would come back when I'm not in a hurry"}
{"text":"GREAT, superb chocolate and desserts!!  You really should go here.  Docked one star because I showed up with a group of 15 or so about twenty minutes before they closed down, and they told me 'sorry, we're closed,' and then agreed to serve us takeout only, and not the full menu.  There's nothing wrong with closing when it's time to close...it's just that some places would go above and beyond instead, being more concerned about earning 15 repeat customers."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant pour faire le plein de chocolat! Il y a énormément de choix pour les dessert afin de combler les envies de tous. Par contre, les repas salés ne sont pas leur spécialité! En effet, j'ai commandé deux paninis qui ressemblent à ce que n'importe qui pourrait faire à la maison, c'est-à-dire du pain, de la mayonnaise, du jambon et du fromage. Je n'ai par contre rien à dire sur le service qui était excellent et assez rapide! Un arrêt nécessaire à faire à Montréal!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Quality and portions.. can't complain about it. Prices are ok but 10$ for two little sandwiches.. idk.  I wasn't happy with the service.. she was complaining about being tipped too less.. unbelievable"}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit :) je le recommande aux amoureux du chocolat! Ambiance chaleureuse,  service sympathique et biensur un grand choix de délicieux dessert.  Un excellent endroit pour passer un bon moment entre amis."}
{"text":"This place has amazing desserts! Perfect for people who are chocolate addicts. The portions are big and it's a bit on the expensive side, but totally worth it. But here's why I am only giving them 3 stars. Last time we went there in October 2013, we had terrible service:  When we came in, (which was out 5th time probably), the place was rather empty, about 2-3 tables were occupied. We sat down, already knowing what to order. We ordered, and then we wait. After 15-20 minutes of waiting, I noticed how it took so long since it was only one plate and we would always order it previously. Our table was facing the checking counter, where the waiters would usually punch in the orders. I saw our waiter going to the counter, and said loudly \"Oh Sh*t!!\" with another waitress beside him. She looked at us with a \"shocking\" look on her face, and walked away. Immediately after I saw that, our waiter came to us and said \"Sorry guys, your plate will be there in like 10 minutes, there's a problem with the waffle machine\" and he proceeded to give us the knives and forks, which they usually do right after we tell our order.  Obviously, I didn't believe him, I just knew it was pure BS and he simply forgot to put in our order. Also, I saw another waiter giving a plate of waffles to another table that came AFTER us, we waited 10 more minutes and left unsatisfied.   Since then, we haven't returned to this place, since the waiter lied to us straight up and nobody else seemed to care of what happened. Service has never been the best there, and that day proved it. We understand it was a mistake and that these things happen, but we are a big fan of this place and we are going to the one in the village, which has better service.   I would recommend Cacao 70 to anybody who loves chocolate, waffles and ice cream, this place is exceptional for what they do, despite of what happened! :)"}
{"text":"it's a bit on the pricy side but totally worth it..i go there mostly every other weekend and oh do i enjoy it!! their coffee is always on point and all the waiters are friendly even though it gets so busy especially on sundays..the chocolate pizza,classic hot chocolate and the sweet experiences are all must trys"}
{"text":"I had the \"Illegal chocolate waffle\" - Classic waffle drizzled with a 36% caramel chocolate sauce, milk chocolate shavings, served with caramelized bananas, crunchy chocolate wafer balls, chocolate sauce on the side and whipped cream. Now if that picture (shown in original post on my blog) above doesn't look like some sordid orgy of everything you know of breakfast, brunch, chocolate, and sin to be true and what you'd think the last room service order to Britney Spears' hotel room looks like before she shaved her head... then I don't know what does."}
{"text":"The interior of the cafe was clean and organised, with lots of space in between tables so you can surely get some private time while dining there. Got the lazy breakfast and it was served with a mini fruit platter that came with melted chocolate on the side which was simply a treat. Coffee was pretty decent as well. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to have an exceptional brunch!"}
{"text":"I would give 3 stars for the food but 0 star for the service. A very small thing but they deal it so badly.  Food? Ice cream taste good? others are ok? but the waffle is too soft.  Service? 1. A sign of only to go was stood in front of the door half hour before closing. Ok, I can understand maybe they want to close the store right at 11pm. Why don't they just change the dine in hours to 10:30pm?  2. About 5 minutes, the server came to give me the take out, one big plastic bag of kitchen utensils, a big box, a tray with 3 cups. ( I only ordered 1 waffle) Was he thinking that take out customers should take each piece separately?! His reason was the bag doesn't fit the waffle boxes. The take out items should be hold separately or horizontally in the bag with two hands. I only ordered one Item and the take out was pack in a weird way. He said he can not do any thing.  3. I mentioned I can't take it like this. At this time the manager came and fixed the problem easily. All the boxes were fit in the same bag easily. So far so good. However when I tried to mention him what just happened with that waiter. He didn't want to listen and even said I am blaming his employee?!    I understand they all are very busy on dine in customers, but this is not the reason to treat other take out customer so so so poor. Not pack up the take out? Not listen to complains?Won't won't won't go again."}
{"text":"the waiting time is long but the food is always amazing, my all time favorite the marshmallow bbq and choc crepe, it has become a traditional between me and my friend to always take our dessert at cacao 70 after our meal on st-catherine, i always bring my visting friends there, its a must in Montreal !"}
{"text":"The raspberry crepe with Belgian milk chocolate is amazing! It's my go-to whenever I come here. The staff is hit and miss, sometimes it's great service and sometimes it could be better. But that crepe though, keeps me coming back..."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's birthday along with my other friends. We took the sharing sharing menu for 2 or more; which essentially has most of delicicacies of the menu covered. It contained a quarter of triple chocolate pizza, marshmallows for roasting, grahm crackers for smores, fresh strawberries for fondue, chocolate covered waffles, and carmelized bananas. I found the waffles to be the best of them all. The waffles were hot and perfectly crunchy. The service was fast and the waiter was very nice and cheerful. I love the clean, pristine atmosphere of the place. I would most definitely come back to satisfy my sweettooth! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent ! Rien a rajouter, une superbe place de brunch pas trop cher et sympathique."}
{"text":"Food: Can't help it, love this place even though I don't like sweets that much! but the fondue is to die for! so good!!"}
{"text":"This is the best spot if you have a sweet tooth and love quality chocolate! Lots of chocolate options and combinations (fondue, hot coco, shakes...). The dark and white chocolate fondue is delicious.  Don't go there for anything salty or crepes, there are better spots in the city. Customer service was not good. The decor is also disappointing."}
{"text":"Really cute place to have a hot chocolate.  When we first walked in we were promptly greeted and seated with the menus. Atmosphere is quite nice; woody chalet feel with good lighting which is ideal for someone who wants to study.   Shortly after sitting down, a waiter came over with a cute bottle of water and two little cups filled with both the dark and milk chocolate bases for the hot cocoa. Nice complementary touch to help you decide what you want to drink and eat.  I had the lactee superieure hot chocolate with the milk cocoa base. It comes in two parts.... 1) you have a high ball glass with the bottom filled with your choice of chocolate 2) a cute metal measuring cup with the base of your choosing. You have a spoon to mix it and voila!!!! heaven in a glass.  My choice of chocolate was really good..... it smooth and velvety. Drank it with no problem :)  My friend had the Milk frozen hot cocoa. She drank it all and really liked it. I didn't have a taste so i can't explain it in great detail. But she seemed to enjoy it considering it was gone within 5 min. :)  Prices are on the steeper side..... 10.50$ with tax for my drink, not including tip. It is to be expected considering it is premium chocolate.   Too bad we had just came from the noodle factory or i would have had something to eat.  Next up at cocoa 70......... The amazing pizzas or maybe a waffle?!?!?!  stay tuned for my review :)"}
{"text":"Double order fondue was incredible. Stay away from the vegetarian grilled sandwich, it was awful... desserts made up for that! Cozy atmosphere"}
{"text":"I passed by Cacao 70 on the street, and I had to double back and have my third breakfasts there on a Tuesday. The place was completely empty (because of the time of day), but I loved the decoration and watching the pedestrians through the big front window.  I ordered a fabulous nutella crepe with raspberries with an Earl Grey tea. I wish I could take this cafe home to my home city so I could have something like this on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"I've been to Cacao 70 multiple times as it is close to my apartment but haven't felt the need to review this establishment until very recently due to probably the worst experience at a restaurant yet.   I went here with two girlfriends Friday night around 10:30 pm and was not surprised to see a line up almost out the door. We waited for around 30 minutes in line, drooling due to the smells and seeing other people eating. We were very excited to be having dessert here as one of my friends had never been. We chatted while we waited watching as some people left, starting to get a bit impatient. A waitress came by to take our party number saying it would be 15-20 minutes of wait time.   After 30 minutes, maybe more of waiting we were seated by the same waitress who apologized due to being understaffed. That's when I realized that there were only two people on the floor waiting the entire restaurant on a Friday night. By this point we were very hungry and thirsty from waiting, but no water was brought to our table. This is where things went down hill fast....  1. We had to wait 20+ minutes for water to be brought to our table and it was only after I had to bark down the waiter who would not look at our table as he passed it multiple times.   2. After finally getting our water, our order was taken and food arrived shortly after (~10-15 minutes) but one of my friends had ordered a cafe au lait which we had to ask for THREE times before finally receiving a lukewarm coffee. No one came by to check how we were and we were very unhappy with the service.  The waiters knew they were understaffed and it took us an hour and a half to be seated, eat, and pay because of terrible service. They didn't even offer to give us anything to make the wait more enjoyable nor did they make us feel like they cared at all. At one point, there was no one on the floor and that's when I wanted to get up and leave. This is the first time I have ever left no tip at a restaurant and it was well deserved.  I can definitely say I will not be going back after such a horrible evening at Cacao. It is unbelievable to think that they were 'understaffed' on a Friday evening, probably their busiest time yet there were 4+ people in the kitchen.   Beware of their terrible and rude service."}
{"text":"Alles rund um Schokolade . Perfekt für die Seele und natürlich den Magen. Große Auswahl und große Portionen. Also besser Hunger mitbringen. Gemütliches Ambiente mit stabilen schnellem WLAN."}
{"text":"Clearly don't go here if you don't like chocolate.  We had the bitter selection for two.  Hot choc good..nice and bitter..fondue just enough..marshmallow toaster was fun, but also good for keeping warm.   What spoiled it was it the seats.  It's January, it's freezing in Montreal.. So being put at the,table that gets the blast of of arctic air whenever the next lot of customers feel the need to,keep both doors open as they try to get in.  Not a pleasant way to eat chocolate.. However the chic was great!  Get a proper porch!"}
{"text":"Cacao70 is a must go when you stop in Toronto!! The menu is based around the chocolate concept but don't worry, if you don't like sweets there's an entire breakfast/brunch menu as well. My friend and I each ordered the party waffle which was huge! It was completely saturated in whipped cream, strawberries, and chocolate of course. We really could have split one. It came with white and milk chocolate dipping sauces as well as chocolate covered cereals which were so delicious. As well, we split a fondue tray which was absolutely perfect in regards to size, selection, and taste. Definitely do not leave this place without ordering a fondue! Service was fast, the ambience was calm and quiet and it was cozy inside. They have wifi as well which was such a nice touch for us since we were coming from the states. everything on the menu looked amazing and I wish that I had more time in Toronto to go again! Favorite place in Toronto by far!"}
{"text":"Overpriced ...  7$ for one layer of crape... The washroom was not clean. I'm sorry but I don't recommend here."}
{"text":"Decadent and rich, whether you're getting one of their desserts or breakfast meals.   Seriously, their dessert is so fattening and it'll get you full. It can replace your lunch, if you don't have heavy lunches or if you don't eat a lot in general.   They'll serve you some fruits with chocolate fondue no matter what you order, kind of like how restaurants serve you bread and butter at the beginning.   I got Fondue Triple Chocolat; a tall mug of really thick chocolate (swirl of dark, milk and white), 6 small pieces of decadent brownies, and a variety of fruits. To be honest, if I knew they'd be giving us complimentary fruits and fondue, I'd have ordered something different.....What I ordered was just like, a heavier and expensive extension of the complimentary stuff they gave. Unless you LOVE fondue, order something different from what they're giving you already (basically, I don't recommend ordering fondue).  My friend got one of their breakfast meals for lunch, and he was very happy with it at the beginning, but later he got sick of eating it, because it's a looot of meat...ham, sausage, egg, bacon... nothing refreshing or light about it. Didn't have any veg or fruits.   Great date place, good tourist experience. I wouldn't come back here again though...It's a little tooooo decadent (to be honest, after I had their complimentary stuff, I had had enough chocolate), and I'm not rich enough to keep coming back every time I want something sweet. I give four stars because I think you should try it at least once."}
{"text":"Great location, in the heart of Montreal's gay village. I literally eat myself into a chocolate coma every time I come here. Everything is amazing. Only downfall, and the reason for the for star rating, is that every time I've come here, my waitress usually ends up missing in action after the food is served."}
{"text":"We went there twice. Once for lunch and once for dessert. Had hang-over omelet and crepe for my bf. At first I was worried there won't be enough for lunch, but it turns out the omelet was very tasty and filling - they've given enough ingredients to prepare it. It also comes with a small fresh fruit chocolate fondue (which is good enough for us to share) to start with so I think it justifies the price tag for \"just an omelet\"  As for the crepe, it was just very rich and delicious chocolate.  The second time we went, we had \"A little bitter chocolate experience for two\". Comes with fruits, marshmallow, a little flame grill to roast your marshmallows, vanilla ice cream and a big tub of dark chocolate and a small chocolate drink. It was fun, and tons of chocolate for you to dip. The drink was heavenly, and we feel super full after the dessert. Probably will need a 3rd person next time.  Space wise, the store is spacious and deep. If you want some privacy you can seat yourself to the back of the restaurant. There are Ikea power bars everywhere with usb chargers so I guess they wanted to make it a somewhat a cafe. They've stopped giving free wifi though 2 weeks after opening."}
{"text":"Cacao 70 is a great place to go to with people with different tastes, there's something sweet for everyone!   The line to get in will be long (out the door even!) no matter when you go but don't get stressed if the host hasn't even looked at you, the time will be made up while (barely) waiting for your food after you order it!   However, I would suggest asking them to bring you your bill at the same time as your food. I've waited for my bill for a long time before and having your bill with your meal allows you to leave when you want to and not have to wait all that extra time.  For the atmosphere, it smells lovely in there (chocolate, of course!) and the decor is very chic. The tables for two are just the right size unless you each order a chocolate pizza, that's when it get's squishy. The last thing is that it's pretty hot in there so waiting in line with a jacket on could be brutal if you're someone who gets hot easily!  When it comes to food, their chocolate fondues are the way to go! The chocolate is so rich that even a little bit is enough and having the fruit, peices of crêpe and brownies to dip in it only make it better! Their desserts are very decadent, leaving you with a chocolate high. Very nice presentation; very picture-worthy! Almost so nice you won't want to dig in- except for the fact that it looks so delicious!  I would recommend having a healthy snack a couple hours before going here and not going on an empty stomach because it's just so much sugar! But don't have a huge meal either because these dishes, even when shared, are quite filling!  It's always fun to try something new at Cacao 70 and free wifi is pretty great! I go at least once a month, definite recomendation unless you're impatient."}
{"text":"Went for brunch here the past weekend.  Pros   - Friendly staff - Nice atmosphere - Toast is amazing - Clean   Cons  - The eggs are like rubber. I'm assuming they are done in a microwave  - No drip coffee (don't bother with Americano. small cup and not worth the price.) - Menu is beyond out of control. 1001 choices (my personal preference is when a restaurant sticks to a certain number of dishes rather then bringing a binder full of options.) - The price for breakfast vs. quality is ridiculous."}
{"text":"My to go to dessert place! Awesome for casual meet ups! Its afordable & delicious what more can one ask for? Ive tried different types of dessert snd my top 1 is the pizza , its just so tasty! I love it"}
{"text":"If you are a student and enjoy good company and good looking desserts, come here. Service at the kitchen and around the tables is not so great. Even with good quality products, the chocolate was room temp ( even after requesting to warm it up!) and server did not overlook our table after sitting down. We needed to request napkins twice! Anyways I don't think I'll come back with my wife and young kids again. We went to Juliette & Chocolat at DIX30 two weeks ago and it was far better than this."}
{"text":"My friends and I found this place through Yelp during a visit to Montreal. We were debating between a few recommendations but boy we were glad we picked this one! The place is hip, the portions humongous, the food delish! This has to be one of my best breakfast/ brunch experiences. The pictures speak for themselves. Will denitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Amazing! Melt a marshmallow on a fire that reminds you of a camp fire or have the fondue. Must go here if you love chocolate!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, nice staff. Pizza is way too sweet for my taste, but crepes and fondues are pretty good. (Good food visual)  I like to take their make your own parfait, portion is good for 2 people and not too expensive. Other things on the menu can be on the pricy side."}
{"text":"Got the chicken and mayo savory crepe and the black and white chocolate dessert crepe. Both delicious! The white chocolate here is especially delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are coming with a group of 5 or more, expect to wait. I was there with a group of 5. A table of 4 and a table of 2 right next to each other were available. The staff refused to put the two tables together because it is against company policy. So, we had to wait while a group of 4 and a group of 2 got the tables before us. Extremely poor customer service. I will never come here again even when I'm not in a group."}
{"text":"A friend of mine mentioned that he came here a few times, on dates.  This place does seem totally designed for dates, many items are for two :) and what's more romantic than chocolate??   When you walk in you will inevitably draw a comparison with Juliette and chocolat... Decor wise, this place seems more cosy and inviting. But menu and dessert wise it's on par with Juliette and chocolat.  The menu is extensive, and it gave me a case of I don't know what I want-itis...  What we ended up having was a banana split, NYC chocolate shake, and volcano, which is a brownie with a scoop of ice cream.  The NYC shake, is not creamy, made with mostly ice, so good for those who are lactose intolerant, but then again a shake without cream or ice cream is in my opinion, a tragedy!!! but it was very chocolaty and less sweet.  The banana split was the best thing we had. But ice cream, banana and chocolate sauce is hard to miss.   The volcano was too sweet, the brownie was too sweet even though it had a lot of chocolate flavor. It was topped with a scoop of ice cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce, caramel, and strawberry sauce... too many sauces, and sugar over kill.   Again, another nice concept in theory, but things didn't pan out as we had hoped. I do want to go back as there were some things I wanted to try out but could not since we were full coming here...  My wish is to have something made with chocolate incorporated in it, some cake or something, not some dessert with chocolate sauce on it... it seems unimaginative, plus we have plenty of that at Juliette and chocolat, why can't we get something different?"}
{"text":"Dont call \"crepes from Brittany\" when you obviously don't know what it is. Greasy and flavourless. Plus some clean would be nice considering this is just above the \"kitchen\"."}
{"text":"I would leave a better review but I only arrived 20 minutes before the closing time (damn you poor metro system). Honestly I felt so bad and I actually would have understood if they had refused me but the staff that served me was kind and welcoming. I ended up ordering for take out a hot chocolate and waffles (the banana split one), which were both very good but you really have to be a fan of chocolate because there's a lot of it. Chocolate on the waffles, chocolate on the bananas, extra chocolate sauce on the side, you name it. It's not called Cacao 70 for nothing. A bit pricey I must say but still okay for the portions you get. I'll definitely come back but this time I'll get to sit down and relax more."}
{"text":"Kid friendly, excellent service. Food is unique. Definitely mix up your order with the sweet and savoury. Loved our ricotta Nutella pizza with a side of espresso topped with ice cream!"}
{"text":"Went to visit the McGill ghetto and was pleasantly surprised by this Cafe at Milton and Parc. My friend and I ordered a chocolate marshmallow pizza (quarter inch)  to share. Although the menu stated it was for one person, it was more than enough for the two of us. The 'pizza' came with bananas and strawberry to dip in chocolate as well. We were very happy with the meal and the service.   We went around 3pm on  a Monday and the place was quite empty. It would've been so nice to have had this Cafe to go to back when I went to McGill!"}
{"text":"Should hire more people since it's crazy busy during the Christmas market. Servers were overwhelmed and not very helpful. The wait is ridiculous. People who came in after us were also served before us."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. I am a chocolate lover, love dark chocolate everything. I ordered a quadriple chocolate parfait... Sounds fancy doesn't it? Ya it was just regular chocolate ice cream with 2 bits of brownies in it. Cost me 11.50. My friend ordered a banana split. It was a soupy mess with pieces of bananas in it. I understand the place was busy, but this was unacceptable. When we pointed the melted ice cream to the server, his attitude was very snooty. He just rudely said \"I see it\" and took it away. Guys, if you have any taste in good chocolate and good quality desserts, this is not the place for you.The prices are pretty fancy though. Highly disappointing, will not come back."}
{"text":"The hot chocolate is very good (albeit overpriced). But what's unbearable is the annoying commercial advertising on the radio channel that's running in the background. Awful."}
{"text":"Went to this place for breakfast whilst visiting Toronto and enjoyed it so much I went back a couple days later to their other location! This location is the better one though so I recommend coming here. I had the croque monsieur and my boyfriend had the savory pancake. Both were very good. The second time we went back we just went for dessert and tried one of the signature waffle which was very good. I wish they opened a store in LA because I would definitely go regularly!"}
{"text":"On my last last adventure I visited the lovely city of Montreal.  I saw this restaurant  and had to try it. Oh my Goodness this place was Sooooooo Good! I went back two days in a row.  The first day I had the veggie frittata and to my excitement it came with a tray of fresh fruit w/chocolate dipping sauce!  The second day I had the raspberry chocolate crepe with a bowl espresso and milk Mmmmm delicious!  If I had more time in that wonderful city I would have gone there everyday to experience a different plate of chocolate and food."}
{"text":"came here for a visit bringing friends and family them around town. i first had cacao 70 back in montreal. it was amazing. chocolate overload. since toronto had opened 2 locations, i decided to give them a try. not worth it. my friend and i shared the waffle topped with whip cream, vanilla ice cream, a tiny bit of almonds, a drizzle of chocolate sauce. they came with a side of bananas, strawberries, and a bit more of chocolate sauce. i would have to say the best part is probably just the sauce and the bit of crushed almonds. don't even get me started on the waffle. it was soggy and cold, extremely thin, when i picked it up with my fork it was flimsy. yikes. the ice cream was very icy and store bought, the side of fresh fruit, ah well, at least it was fresh. overall extremely disappointing. i think i'll just save my visits for when im in montreal."}
{"text":"How to start describing the deliciousness of the chocolate, the waffles, the ice cream??!!. I go there all the time and absolutely love it"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were curious to try this place out, and shared a \"sweet experience for two\". Some were definitely bigger hits (marshmallow chocolate pizza) than others (vanilla ice cream -- but mainly because you're just not interesting enough when your neighbours on the dessert plate are chocolate brownie bites, chocolate wafers, and chocolate sauce) but I liked the variety.   Contrary to Juliette's (where service is a bit inconsistent -- some days I feel like that place is oozing snootiness), our server here was super helpful, friendly, and what I appreciated the most -- she didn't try to talk us into ordering more food than what we could finish. (We were considering getting the sampler AND a waffle, but she advised us to start with one and to see how we feel because she said it was common that people's eyes were bigger than their stomachs when it came to the restaurant). We took her advice and boy was she right!! We needed to be rolled out the door after that dessert sampler and would never have been able to take a few bites of anything else.   I feel like 4-stars might be more appropriate for this place but the prices feel a smidge too high. I've only been here once, so I will dutifully go again to see if the service is as awesome as the first time to see about bumping this up to 4!"}
{"text":"Chocolate heaven!! Went here for dessert last night and it was great! Lots of selection to satisfy every type of chocolate lover. Service was very good and place was packed with people at 10pm. The only down side was its pretty pricey once you add tax and tip but it's not like you'd go every day.  You'd likely only go for special occasions except for my friend Tina who'd likely frequent this place daily. Lol"}
{"text":"Great dessert place, especially for Chocolate lovers! Nice place to get together with friends. Definitely worth it to order the specialty hot cacao drinks. I loved the Venezuela choice. We were 5 and shared the Bitter Chocolate Experience for two, it was yummy and more than enough! Would be back!"}
{"text":"Tried the vegetarian sandwich for lunch. It was $10 bucks and turned out to be two slices of soggy bread with some soggy spinach and 2 tomato slices. Won't be back"}
{"text":"In need of Saturday brunch our hotel's concierge recommended this place. It was amazing. The restaurant is really cute and has an upbeat fun cafe vibe. It smells like chocolate as soon as you open the door. The menu has tons of options so everyone is bound to find something they would like. We both got frittatas which came served in a cast iron pan. They were perfect. To our surprise the frittatas came with fresh fruit and melted chocolate for dipping. I'm not a big chocolate fan but I have to say the chocolate was really delicious. The service was great. I would love to visit Cacao 70 again when returning to Montreal in the future."}
{"text":"Stumbled across Cacao 70 on our way elsewhere and decided to try it. So glad we did! Thankfully we weren't too full from dinner, but even so a single parfait worked perfectly for two. We got one with chocolate-mint ice cream. I was a little worried when it arrived -- oftentimes green chocolate-mint ice cream is lower quality than white -- but it was great. It's two generous scoops of ice cream (and they happily gave us another bowl so it was easier to split) plus a whole slew of toppings. We really got a kick out of the options this provided. We dipped the fresh strawberries and the chocolate wafers in the hot fudge to create a mini fondue, as well as experimented with the various toppings in different combinations with the ice cream. The hazelnut \"crunchy bits\" were wonderful, and the brownie -- a very generous portion -- was excellent both plain and with the ice cream.    The missing star is for the price. This place ain't cheap. But it's definitely worth it as a special occasion place. And I suppose it's good for our waistlines that most of us can't afford to eat here regularly!   Sadly we didn't get the hot chocolate samples other people got, but there are numerous varieties, including several types of cinnamon and/or chili hot chocolates that I can't wait to try. Discovering Cacao 70 is making me look forward to my next visit to Montreal even more."}
{"text":"Favorite place ever. The fondue is amazing, same thing for the shakes. Went there a couple of times and always had a great experience. The people are so kind and we are always well served."}
{"text":"First time going to this place and I absolutely loved it! The place isn't that big but it feels cozy. The service was okay. The menu has a lot of choices,  but my friend and I went there for a fondue, we ordered \"Triple Chocolate Fondue\" in double ,and it was delicious! Though I felt like that there wasn't enough fondue for our fruits since at the end we had some fruits left. We even had chosen the double one.   I would recommend this place to my friends and I'm already looking forward to my next visit there! Its a must go\" during winter time !"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends from New York we had staying with us. We each had a hot chocolate and split a few of the desserts! All the hot chocolate there is AMAZING. I love dark chocolate and that melted in milk is so rich and creamy. We shared the platter that comes with the small fire put in the middle so we can roast marshmallows! Such a fun place to go...especially when it's cold out! It's often busy though so be prepared to wait, especially if you're a big crowd"}
{"text":"Great place to visit on a cold winter night! Warm up with some delicious super rich hot choclate! Made with real chocolate melted made into beverage form. Mmm. I got a strawberry cheesecake crepe which came with a side of strawberries and chocolate fondue sampler and strawberry sauce! Crepe was to die for, so amazing but way too much for one person. Def a place to share food at or be prepared forns ugar overload. Only thing i didnt like was the young boys who work there because i could hear their conversations about stupidness while i am trying to enjoy all of this goodness! They did provide good service although the professionalism is lacking. I do not want to hear 16 year old boys boast and brag about their personal life stories which kind of ruined our visit. Also my friend and I were not sure if we were supposed to go up to the counter to order/pay because some guests were... Although they did take our orders and such but took a long time to do so. Otherwise the choclate is amazing and food quality is great."}
{"text":"Great little place for indulging...if you have a sweet youth and you like chocolate then this is a must try. Staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Service is okay but the food is not so good. Crepe is definitely not worth it for any price. the sandwiches are okay......"}
{"text":"I used to love the hot chocolate at this place but I was totally disappointed last night. I had the same Italian Hot Chocolate a couple months ago but this time the chocolate is ridiculously sweet and watery. Italian hot chocolate is supposed to be thick. It's about the cocoa and the milk. But no. They have to screw it up. This place has gone downhill. I told the server about it and he added more 100% dark cocoa to balance it but it's still watery. I specifically asked him to make sure it's hot. But it still comes back only lukewarm. What's the point of having hot chocolate when you can't make it hot? This place is seriously lacking passion in making chocolate. Maybe it should be called Emo Cacao 70.  I also used to love its waffle but last night we were greeted with soggy waffle. WTF! I'm charged 16.95 for a plate of soggy waffle. The sides on all three of our desserts is the same banana, strawberry, and chocolate syrup. It's boring."}
{"text":"Service was okay but the food was awful. I ordered an omelette and it was cold. My boyfriend ordered a sandwich and it was soggy and dry. Don't go here if you don't have to."}
{"text":"After many delicious snapchats from my friends I was eager to try this place out for myself at the distillery location. I went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't packed; in fact a few tables were getting up to leave as we walked in. Another group was also waiting when we walked in and they simply got up and left 5 minutes after we arrived. We waited to be seated (as per the sign at the door) for 15 minutes total. NOT ONCE during that time did a server look up in our direction to acknowledge that we were waiting, or take our names down, or apologize for the wait. It felt like they were ignoring us on purpose. Needless to say I am disappointed and took my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time at cocoa 70, it's amazing...I had the brownie volcano with vanilla ice cream and it was out of this world...loved everything about it...the brownie was moist and rich and the ice cream so creamy. I also had cappuccino, loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Les portions sont plus que raisonable et le prix est très raisonable aussi. Petit endroit chaleureux pour les couples . Ils font également les brunchs du midi et offrent une bonne variété.  Excellent service! The portions are more than reasonable and the price is very reasonable too. Small cozy place for couples . They also do brunchs and offer a good variety."}
{"text":"Came here a year ago as a first date with my now boyfriend. We went to Cacao 70 again last night while also looking at the Christmas market. We had the large fondue plate which came stacked with a ton of fruit that we couldn't even finish. Good service, and relatively cheap prices."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to go here since it opened.  Unfortunately the day we fibaly decide to come their debit machine was down n we only had 5 bucks ..we tried the volvano which was around $9.   Really liked the balance of coconut and brownie. Whipcream was fresh and not too sweet. We had a good experience. Would go back and try more:)"}
{"text":"Horrible experience and terrible waiter EVER!!! At first, I asked green tea and he gave me earl grey and insisted I ordered earl grey. Also, he served us with the forks he dropped on the ground and insisted because he was the only waiter there. That's his excuse to served us with the dirty fork? If we didn't see it, is it ok to serve customers dirty forks??? I seriously question about the sanitation of the cafe. Also when we were leaving the waiter yelled at us loudly because we didn't leave enough tips and he threw the tip out of the store and shouted us to get out! This is the worst dining experience I ever had in Toronto!!  Also, the fruit came with the fondue were NOT fresh at all. The bananas were brown."}
{"text":"I had a fuffly light and delicious frittata. My husband got the chocolate oatmeal. Both dishes came with fresh fruit in chocolate dipping sauce. Stupendous!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I ordered the classic chocolate fondue for one at the Queen Street location and it was very underwhelming. The amount of chocolate fondue they give you is ridiculously small (yet it came in a deceivingly tall bowl) and the brownie had a weird after taste, as though it had been sitting in a fridge that contained diced onions. So bizarre. Will not ever go back. Demetre's and Café Crepe are way better!"}
{"text":"Le lieu des chocophyles! Tout est là, l'ambiance, l'odeur du chocolat, la qualité, la longue liste de choix."}
{"text":"Belle alternative a Juliette et Chocolat. On appréciera les tables en bois ! Spécial mention a la gaufre au fruit avec sa crème et sa boule de glace!! J'ai aussi beaucoup aimé la présentation du chocolat dans de très beaux verres!  J'y retournerai! 2 succursales a Montréal, les 2 sur Ste Catherine."}
{"text":"Quite expensive. Although, that doesn't seem to stop the long waits and lineups.  Dessert pizza is very tasty but again, the price doesn't seem justified.  The service can be very poor. For example, on one visit, I literally gave the waitress the last bit of money I had in my wallet... 5$. She had brought us 2 dishes and had returned once to ask if everything was to our liking. That's it. That's the extent of her work. 5$ was a very decent tip, just under 18%. I like to tip well when service is good. Which it was up until then. As I handed her the 5$ I said \"this is all I have...\"    She took it , her grin changing to irritation and she turned around and walked away without so much as a thank you. I left knowing I would never return. I can eat some Nutella at home, thank you very much. I don't need some waitress with entitlement issues giving me attitude. If someone gave me all the cash they had in their wallet, which was by no means a bad tip, I would thank them kindly. Not be a miserable b to them. Unfortunately this was enough to make me never return. And honestly had I known she would react that way, I'd have kept my money. I work hard too."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat and get dessert. They have a wide selection of hot chocolates, desserts, and some regular food as well (sandwiches, crepes, etc.). The staff were very friendly and helpful. Prices were reasonable for the kind of restaurant that it is - not cheap, but good for being located in a touristy area like the Distillery District.   Definitely give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a date.  After a meal, I was looking for a place to have fruits. Had a craving for fruits on that day. haha She suggested me Cacao70.  We ordered a chocolate fondue for 2 :D I asked for extra fruits.  Banana, strawberry, apple tastes good with chocolate. It was fun to deep fruits into chocolate.  She was all excited about it.  The waffle drives her crazy haha Staff was very kind. Water cup was always filled up. The atmosphere was great.  Great experience. I'm not a crazy fan about chocolate, but the extra fruits was really nice. Strongly recommend for date place.  Excite her with damn chocolate haha"}
{"text":"Quelle déception! Un décor génial, mais ça s'arrête la... J'ai commandé, au jeune serveur visiblement emmerdé d'être la, une crêpe bananes et chocolat à 64%. Rien de plus classique et standard pour ce genre d'établissement. J'ai reçu une quelconque crêpe sans saveur, pâteuse et élastique à souhait garnie d'une banane tout aussi sans saveur (c'est l'hiver, mais bon! Si tu n'arrives pas à avoir des fruits importés de qualité en cette période, change ton menu et opte pour des fruits d'ici!). Il y avait du chocolat que sur le dessus de la crêpe et en petite quantité. L'intérieur était donc sec et ennuyant à mourir... Et que dire des prix, exorbitants pour la qualité des produits! Pas du tout apprécié l'expérience! :-("}
{"text":"Absolutely a winner! Ample seating, air conditioning, wifi, pretty decor, great music, friendly staff, plus delectable desserts and shakes made from real quality chocolate? Can we please duplicate this restaurant all over the city? How about Queen West today, but north of Queen tomorrow?  If you're just looking for a snack and not a full Belgian waffle, try the brownies.   And you must try that chocolate banana shake. Oh my.   Tip: If you are looking for a place to impress a date, this is it. You're welcome."}
{"text":"We stopped for dessert prior to the airport. Place was very cute. We were only one of two tables there at the time. There were only two workers. We were sat down quickly but it took a while before our orders were taken. At this point I should probably have a disclaimer that I was in Paris a few months ago so I may be biased. The hot chocolate was thick and rich. You can tell they melted good quality chocolate. It was super pricey though. My cup of hot chocolate was $10 (Canadian dollar) plus extra for marshmallow. My husband's crepe was just ok. After we were done with desserts, we also had to wait a while before we got our checks as the waitress was playing with her phone."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. Service wasn't good. Mildly dissapointed. Very cool concept though."}
{"text":"This was my favorite brunch place that I visited in the city. We were planning on going to L'Avenue just across the street, but the line was out the door, so we walked over to this place instead. All of the brunch options include a fruit and chocolate fondue, which was delicious. The cappucino was fantastic. The omelette was a little empty and could have used more ingredients, but there's a large menu so you have plenty of options."}
{"text":"Would definitely not recommend the food I had: First of all, their \"hot chocolate\" was unfortunately in fact pretty cold.   So was the vegetable crepe that I had later. The crepe tasted a bit sour (whole wheat?), the vegetables inside the crepe were not done, the eggs on top of the crepe had no salt or pepper on them. Now that I am thinking of it: I am sure that there were no spices whatsoever in the whole dish.   In a nutshell: If you like bland undercooked food, this might be for you."}
{"text":"Crowded place, I went with friends on sunday afternoon. The chocolate is good bu a bit pricey. Now the service is TERRIBLE! We were 3 friends and got a table (after the looong line). Then 15min later a 4th friend shows up at our table and the waitress refuses to serve him. Apparently it is against their policy to serve 4 people on a small table. We told the waitress we could accommodate, the boss came and told us that we would have to go back to the line up. Again. How retarded."}
{"text":"I fully admit I love chocolate and Cacao70 really satisfied. The menu is large and the portions are huge. I ordered the \"feels like chocolate\" and everything was good. The hot chocolate was one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. On one hand I enjoy most of their sweets, but the service is inconsistent. The first time I was there I had a bad experience with a male waiter while I was with a friend. Forgot our order and was rude. But the second time I went, I had a sweet blonde girl serving us who gave us free marshmallows for our hot chocolates and made good recommendations on what to eat. The fondue is good, the brownies and ice cream parfait is good, and so are the hot chocolates (Italian is my fave).   There's nothing really artisinal about the food, typical cafe stuff but it's convenient to get to. Because of that though the place tends to get packed and noisy on weekends so don't go to relax."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, and service. Went to have breakfast, and ordered a 'feel good omelette' and two chicken and waffles. Overall, the food took more than thirty minutes to arrive and the omelette arrived cold and not fluffy at all. The server was not helpful at all, and overall the food quality was pretty bad. The chicken and waffles comprised of a very stingy portion of chicken breast pieces between two waffles, like a really unappetizing looking sandwich. All in all, a really mediocre experience and this branch is extremely lacklustre when compared to the cacao 70 downtown on st cath"}
{"text":"As usual I come here once a year and  the food is always tasty. The location is great and close to the metro worth fun things to explore around it. The meal sizes are very satisfying.  My favourite part is the complimentary appy of fruit and chocolate to start."}
{"text":"Stopped for a light lunch. Staff very friendly, menus in both French and English. Had a ham and cheese crepe, was really nice light meal that came with a simple salad. Wife, being on vacation, went for straight up chocolate fondue. It was really good, came with fruit, brownies and waffle bits. Waiter saw that I was on the fence about having some and without us asking brought over some extra fruit for me to try. Nice touch.   Probably a little pricier than it should be but still good overall experience."}
{"text":"Came here after dinner to unwind and chat. Ordered their Cacao 70 hot chocolate ($5.25).  Staff were friendly and service was great. Drinks tasted sweet with a strong hint of dark chocolate. My friend and I enjoyed it but didn't like the fact that it came in to-go cups as we were dine-in guests and the drinks were warm not hot.  I came here before for their fondue. The amount of chocolate fondue was misleading as the cup only filled half-way and the accompaniments (apples, brownies and marshmallows) that came with it were so little.   All in all, although the food and drinks were not so bad, the menu is overpriced for what you get. For some, the atmosphere may make up for it but for others, the price may be hard to justify."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and includes something for everyone. I ordered a breakfast omelette and it was fluffy and delicious but the real star of the show is their hot chocolate! It's creamy and smooth without being too bitter or sweet. It's a perfect balance and I highly recommend trying it. This place is a nice stop for a bite but it's definitely a causal place that can get loud. If you're looking for a more quiet place to eat, this isn't it. However, if you're just looking to come in, have good food, and don't mind noise, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Mmm... chocolate fondue... I didn't think there would be anything vegan here, but the dark chocolate fondue was safe for me. My friend had the waffle and brownie bites, and we shared the fruit. It was extremely rich, so I don't know that I'd come here regularly, but it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"Nous avons été servie une demi heure après avoir été arrivée et il n'y avait que 3 tables d'occuper dans la salle. Nous avons commander une fondue double, le plat était minuscule et il nous as coûté 15.00$, il a pris 30 minutes a faire, et il contenait des curs d'ananas... Je ne sais pas pour vous mais je n'ai pas trouver agréable de croquer a pleine dent dans un cur d'ananas ... Nous avons donc fait le commentaire a la serveuse qui nous as répondu tout bêtement que \"il y a des gens qui aimes sa\" ... Des gens qui aime manger des cur d'ananas ? Bon, moi je n'y retournerais pas ...   Le service est pourrie Les assiettes sont minuscules  Il y as des cur d'ananas dans les plats  What the fuck.  Heureusement le chocolat était bon."}
{"text":"This place is chocolate heaven. Went here on a winter night when visiting Montreal.  Everything from the chocolate and the ambience just hit it out of the park. I've been to another chocolate establishment in Montreal (The name of it is Shakespeare inspired, so I'll let you guess.) yet this place is so much better."}
{"text":"J'ai pris la gaufre after Party et je me suis tout simplement régalé ! Je recommande vivement cet établissement ou les prix sont corrects et la nourriture est très bonne. Le staff est très sympa et petit plus quand on est en vacances, l'établissement propose le wifi ! Ce qui est un petit plus. A faire donc !"}
{"text":"A good place to hang out with family and/or friends. There were  a lot of seating area to choose from when we got there which is around 9pm on a Sunday night. We ordered the chocolate fondue, one being matcha white chocolate which I really liked and the other is a dark and white chocolate split. Nothing too special about the menu, just something to fulfill your sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Clearly overwhelmed by the crowd - the restaurant was full when I arrived but they could not get caught up even as it emptied. I was on the patio and two tables left because of how long it was taking to order. Once people ordered it took more than 20 -30 minutes to get coffee. The table of 2 next to me got their coffee after the meal came and no cutlery.  There is clearly a lack of a system in place because when drinks/food finally came out, they didn't know what table to bring it to. Isn't numbering tables on tickets restaurant 101? The table of 8 near me got there food staggered and some people were done eating before other food came out.  I ordered the hangover omelette which comes with toast and potatoes and a side of fruit with chocolate fondue. The food came without the side and when I asked, the guy had no idea what I was saying. I don't think he understood French and didn't have much English. The potatoes were cold and the omelette lukewarm. I got up and brought it back to the kitchen because there was no way I was waiting for someone to check on me. I had already been there an hour.   My food came again about 15 minutes later. The omelette was pretty good but could have used more cheese. I wasn't a big fan of the potato wedges. The fruit was fresh and chocolate was yummy. No one came to check on me. I would have liked a glass of water and more hot water for my tea.  I didn't want to have to wait for the bill so I went to the cash to pay and there was a lineup. Apparently they only have to credit/debit machines and 1 was not functional and the waitress had taken the other one.  While in line I noticed food sitting at the pass getting cold. Dirty dishes piled everywhere, most of the restaurant with empty uncleared tables with lots of unfinished food - I'd say that the food didn't meet other people's expectations either.  And the worst is I didn't even get an apology from anyone"}
{"text":"This place is situated in the more creative part of town. Worth a visit. Do visit  Graffiti Alley. It's just around the corner. Do you like chocolate and sweat stuff? Then this is paradise! Eat your heart out! The interior is quite cosy and staff is very friendly! Coffees are nice too."}
{"text":"We had never heard of this place previously but oh. My. God. It is fantastic! We ordered the black and white chocolate fondue and it was not too sweet and not too rich but perfect. Everything is good. It's got a great environment to peopl-watch cause it's in the gay district and the service was great. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food tasted great. However the service needs some work. The length of time between being seated to being asked what to order was too long."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the sweet heaven in this place.  We went for a late lunch after going to the park and it was perfect. We tried the following: Black and white waffle - vanilla and chocolate ice cream over waffle --delicious Chocolate crepe - really good and rich. The crepe was well done and had a good texture to it. Open face chicken with egg - amazing chicken - flavoring was so good on the chicken  Mushroom omelette was just okay Chocolate chip and mint milk shake - creamy and delicious  The chocolate dip with fruits that came with the dishes was an extra perk that we enjoyed. The fruits was so sweet by itself already. The banana and strawberry was a good combination with the chocolate but the pineapple didn't go as well as the other two fruit. We planning to back again."}
{"text":"Great place for sweets! I had the hot chocolate and shared the fondu with my aunt and uncle.   Service: We waited a few minutes and never had any attention from servers until at least 10-15min so maybe be ready to wait a bit.   Food: the Fondu was really great. It came with fruit, pieces of waffle and brownies. The fruit and waffle pieces were very fresh and tasty. But the brownies were a bit stiff and it also seemed a weird combination to submerge a brownie piece in there. I would change that something else because I really didn't care for them.   Ambience: The place was nicely decorated, clean and sophisticated. It surprisingly didn't get way way too loud even though the restaurant was packed. I still wouldn't recommend it for an intimate conversation during their peak hours."}
{"text":"Pure decadence!  Delicious chocolate.  A cornucopia of selection.  From the healthiest antioxidant packed cocoa to the sweetest desserts, this place has it all.  Huge menu."}
{"text":"It's a very adorable place, I have been there a couple of times. The hot chocolate and the dark chocolate milk shake are my favorite. Their waffle is served with the fruits and ice cream, which is quite well. Althouh the chocolate fondu is delicate, I was not interested in it. cos the taste is just so so. I don't know whether they were too busy to serve me, the service wasn't rapid."}
{"text":"As an update to my previous review from a year ago, the menu has definitely changed a lot since the last time I visited. The selection feels much more limited and the variety just does not offer the same amount of appeal as it once had a year ago. With that said, it is pretty much the spot to be when visiting the Toronto Christmas Market to share a fondue or hot chocolate between friends if you are willing to put up with a minimum 30 minute wait to be seated. The highlight as you would imagine concentrate mainly in the category of drinks and desserts. The portion and quality of their food selection is definitely not something you would be missing out on. In short, fill up on snack foods from the market and then hit up Cacao for a sweet finish to your Toronto Christmas Market visit."}
{"text":"Wondering if all the brown walls are supposed to be a substitute for the lack of chocolate in my crepe?  Found it quite tasteless (the food and the decor)...student hangout. Loud and impersonal.   Will not be back for more. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best dessert I have ever eaten. Also a great place to go with friends, it is a nice and cozy atmosphere, plus they stay open pretty late. Portions are huge which is great, because you can easily split one order between 2 or 3 people. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was great. After walking around the distillery district, we had nice break in there. The atmosphere is bright and comfy. We had chocolate fondue, and the fruits and waffles were great with the melted chocolate. It would have been better if there were more melted chocolate, but still, tasted great. But the coffee could be better I think.  The server was very kind and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place for desserts. Good location and nice staff.   About the food:  - chocolate and fruits crepe: not a good option for us. It comes with around 80% fruits, 15% crepe dough and only 5% chocolate. I missed more chocolate in the dish. - Mexican hot chocolate - delicious creamy hot chocolate. It comes with more chocolate than milk.  - Triple chocolate fondue - delicious  Tip: do the reservation, otherwise you will wait for a long time to get a seat."}
{"text":"Really nice place and atmosphere to sit and relax and with friends but I personally found what I ordered to be a miss. I would definitely love to come back and check out more stuff but I feel like their items are expensive for what you get. I got the zesty crepe and it honestly did not live up to my expectations. It was overly sweet to the point I couldn't even finish half of the crepe. Their hot chocolate was rich but it came lukewarm... so it ended up being disgusting. I really wanted to like this place.   Not to mention our waiter also mixed up our bills with the table next to ours. And thank goodness we asked for it before the other table left because they were just about to get up and leave! (Their bill was probably 2x the price as ours because they were a party of 4 and we were a party of 2..)   Overall the place had a nice ambiance but I probably wouldn't return as it did not live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"We are completely hooked on Cacao 70s uniqueness since its opening, 2011. We go to Cacao 70 at least once a month usually to enjoy their divine hot chocolates and amazing crepes. Just love their crepes so much!"}
{"text":"The classic chocolate fondue is really good, the fruits are fresh and the chocolate itself is very good (milk chocolate)"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for four days and came here twice for brunch! (My sister has a chocolate addiction.) I opted for the fritatta, which was served with crispy bread. It came in a HUGE pan and was quite tasty, although watery at the bottom of the pan.  Service was a little inattentive, although friendly. The other negative would be that the wooden decorative wall that we sat against had large clumps of dust that we were slightly worried about falling into our food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been to another Cacao 70 location, the one on Queen Street and the service there was amazing. Unfortunately, the one here left a really bad taste in my mouth, or rather no taste because we left before we ordered.  When we walked in, there were no staff to greet us which was okay because the sign said \"Please wait to be seated\". We did wait, for about 2-3 minutes standing at the front door and no staff came to greet us. I probably got more looks from customers dining here than the staff themselves! During this time, the staff looked at us and looked away several times when we were waiting at the door. Eventually, we decided to take a seat in the waiting area because others were also waiting there until a table was ready.  About 15 minutes pass, and everyone else in the waiting area has been addressed, so it's our turn. I guess not, another group of two came through and immediately were greeted and served... meanwhile we're waiting at the waiting area. Okay, I get it. Maybe you just didn't see us when we came in, but wouldn't you ask the group of two sitting at the waiting area that you've made eye contact several times with if they wanted to be seated before you seat the people that JUST walked in?  Anyway, at that point we decided to approach the staff (since they really seemed keen on ignoring us), and the man said he just got there and didn't know the situation. Sure, this was true as he wasn't the original waiter that ignored us several times. After explaining our discontent about the discussion for a few seconds, he told us we can have a seat at a table. As he walked passed me, I guess he found it appropriate to say \"sheesh\" to a customer. At that point, I felt quite unwelcomed and decided to leave. I understand if you don't want to work and are having a bad day (which I heard the workers complaining about their day as I waited).  If it isn't too much to ask for at a restaurant, I'd appreciate it if you could at least acknowledge your customers. Safe to say, I won't be back (but I'm sure the waiters won't care after hearing them complain about their long day as I waited)."}
{"text":"Excellent chocolate. Good place to have afternoon desserts. But sometimes u need to wait."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Cacao 70 after having a great experience at Juliette et Chocolat in Montreal earlier this year.   We decided on a quarter slice of the chocolate hazelnut pizza, a dish with Cacao 70's own in-house chocolate. We chose this item because we cannot get this chocolate everywhere.   The dish consisted of a simple pizza dough topped with Cacao 70 chocolate and crushed candied hazelnuts. The dough was dry (not soft or chewy) and the pizza was nowhere near as warm or the chocolate as \"melty\" as I was expecting, especially since the dish was advertised as baked. The chocolate was not tasty (bland actually) and hazelnuts must have been old because they had zero hazelnut flavour and left an unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth. The pizza came with a few sliced strawberries and bananas and melted white chocolate for dunking. This was a nice touch albeit a very small portion for the price.   Overall, this dessert was disappointing and since I'm all about loving every moment of my food, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Je recommande cette place à tout ceux qui aiment les commerce qui se spécialise dans un domaine. Leur menu est recherché et ne manque pas de séduire. Sans doute la plus intéressante selection de chocolat chaud. Prix abordable pour le contenu et la presentation des assiettes sont superbes. Quelques petites surprises vous attendent."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast but I really think it should just stick with deserts. The fruit did not seem very fresh. The food was okay but nothing special. The highlight was my friends meal which was a delicious waffle served with fruit whipped cream and chocolate. I would go back for desert and coffee."}
{"text":"WHAT A SPOT! If I lived in Montreal I would be here for every meal! Whether you enjoy sweet or savory this place has it all (made exceptionally well at that) The waiters and waitresses are super friendly and make sure everything is perfect. The frittatas come in the skillet and super delicious. Hot chocolate is to die for AND comes with the option for added espresso (what's better than that? IDK!) Definitely check out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Holy. Came here on late night on Thursday, it was a bit busy but able to get seated fairly quick.  I tried the black & white waffle while my boyfriend tried the frozen hot chocolate. I thought I couldn't finish the whole thing, but it was SO amazing. Others at the table tried the salted caramel milkshake and loved it.   Service was fantastic and quick considering only one guy was taking care of tables that night, def amazing."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a fun chocolate breakfast for the family before our visit to the aquarium, and they didn't disappoint! Ooey gooey chocolate fondue at the table, a nice assortment of yummy nom noms and everyone left quite happy. Service was five stars... so much so that we went back after our aquarium visit for some hot chocolate. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered triple chocolate fondue. It came with fruits, brownies and waffles pieces. The brownie with chocolate fondue was really chocolatty!! If you are craving for chocolate this is a must! Mini waffles were disappointing, didnt taste like anything. Good place to go with girl friends. Prompt service good location."}
{"text":"Wow. everyone that visits montreal needs to stop by this place. Chocolate HEAVEN!!!! they have absolutely everything everything cocolicious you can imagine. I am not sure if this is a chain but i know that they have at least 2 locations in montreal.  I came in on a week day for lunch after getting recommendations from a friend of mine and also reading about it on food blogs. I must say it does not disappoint! I went for the nutty waffle which consist of nuts with vanilla ice cream, nuts, whip cream, chocolate, nutty drizzles (i think hazelnut), bananas and strawberries. You can substitute your waffles for a crunchier type call cacao 70 for about 2 CAD more i think. I went with that and boy i devour that whole thing down in just a few. So goood!!! it' a bit sweet and quite a big portion for one to finish so i would suggest going with a friend if you can unless you are like me who is traveling on her own. so foodies if you are into nuts and chocolate i highly recommend this one! i was debating between this an the one on the special section \"feel like chocolate\" or the marshmallow and chocolate pizza. But both of the other ones seems a bit overwhelming for one so i went with this instead. Service was fast and pleasant. I would def come back again when I am in town next time around!"}
{"text":"Over the top selection of chocolate everything. Had the platter for 2. Rich and decadent. The fondue is rich and yummy."}
{"text":"Cute place but $17 for 2 cups of hot chocolate to go is just robbery. I don't care what % of cocoa is in it, that is just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Nice place if you're craving something sweet. They have a lot of options, crepes, waffles, hot chocolate, etc. Definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their delicious moka, made with their chocolate and espresso. Their menu looks great and looking forward to trying some of the food out too. The owners and staff are super nice and the space has a nice, relaxed feel."}
{"text":"What can go wrong with chocolate fondue!? Nothing! I live here. We got the chocolate fondue and loved it! It's a great date place!"}
{"text":"Perfect for cozy dates in the winter time. Had the traditional semi sweet chocolate fondue to split between two people ($20). Comes with brownies, waffles,  strawberries, bananas, apples, and pineapples. Server was very understanding about allergies, was able to get extra fruit by removing the pineapple. The chocolate began to harden maybe about half an hour after, so we had to quickly finish eating, there's wasn't any heat source underneath the fondue which was unfortunate. Quite filling - we had a light breakfast beforehand and this was a substitute for lunch."}
{"text":"Something to try, especially if you are a chocolate lover (although don't spill your whole hot chocolate on your pants like I did...)  We had a really sweet waitress and overall enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"i ordered the chocolate oatmeal, honestly i did not like it and I should have listened to te waitress, but their hot chocolates were bomb, and my friends ordered the STRAWBERRY SHORT CAKE crepe which was delicious, I will go back again to order other items. price is moderate, and atmosphere was great but service was a little slow."}
{"text":"This was one of our favourite places in Montreal. We knew they were planning on opening one in Toronto on Queen St but were pleasantly surprised to see it in Distillery district.  We had our dinner early around 7 pm so we had some room for desserts. We had 2 of our friends along with us who didn't know about Cacao70 so we had to get them to experience it. We went in around 11:30 pm, seated immediately. We ordered only one 'sharing sharing for two or more' as we weren't hungry. The price was 35.75$ which is pretty reasonable for four. If you're hungry i would suggest ordering this for two.  It had a quarter chocolate pizza, banana split waffle, strawberries, graham crackers, chocolate wafers, chocolate waffle balls, one scoop ice cream (vanilla), Milk chocolate fondue for dipping, marshmallows, and chocolate sauce.Their hot chocolate is to die for too.   Somehow eating there makes me feel so sleepy, happy and spent at the same time. You all know the feeling. :) Need i say more, visit them..and have a toe curling foodgasm."}
{"text":"When we came here on a friday night, the wait time was 20-25 minutes.   Came here for the black and white waffle, and ordered a brownie as a side so we could eat it with the ice cream from the waffle. Asked to get the brownie warmed up, but when it came it was cold. So we asked the waiter to warm it up again, and it came back at least 20 minutes later (during which time the ice cream had melted considerably), but the brownie was still cold.   The waffle itself was good but the waittimes and customer service was not."}
{"text":"Love, love, love  I always love trying new places and it's even better when I really like it! I've been wanting to come here and finally made it a point to come for my birthday!  I had 9 people in the group and we were told it would be a 30-45 min wait but it wasn't so bad...the light festival was still happening so it was nice to kill time that way. And we ended up only waiting for 15 minutes!   What a great restaurant! I completely love the concept! It's so different and unique from most (if not all) dessert places I typically go to. Since we had a large group, we each decided to get something different so that we could all give it a try!   We ordered... - single fondue set with peanut butter chocolate  - single fondue set with matcha chocolate  - dessert pizza with chocolate, hazelnut and crunchy toppings  - cacao 70 hot chocolate  - waffle with more chocolate!  Everything was soooo good! Super sweet, very rich and decadent but oh so good!  Our server was Mike and he was amazing! Very friendly, patient, genuine, helpful...the list goes on! He went above and beyond to make us happy and made sure that we were ok!   Just remember: there's always room for dessert!"}
{"text":"What can i say - its crepes , chocolate , caramel & other good stuff. And this place has pizza deserts! WIN"}
{"text":"This is my second Cacao 70 location i attended, and i was a bit let down. The service and food was slacking in flavour, consistancy, and over all service. It was extremely slow, to the point to where i think i waited almost 30 mins for my coffee. I even found hair in my food, after that i just stopped eating. My meal wasnt terrible, but i wasnt blown away like i was at the other location. I had the blue mushroom omelet, which was very filling. however, the eggs were over cooked and it was dry...mushrooms felt undercooked. The toast wasnt fully toasted, potatoes were very salty but food otherwise. like i mentioned, service was very slow, was it busy? kinda, but the other location was too and they handled things better..it just seems hectic at this location."}
{"text":"Come here for breakfast! Its not just a dessert spot, i swear you will be so pissed off if you dont. Pretty much every meal comes with some fruit and a little melted choc fondue to dip it in. I personally enjoyed my buckwheat crepe with baby spinach and feta. The spinach was extremely fresh--nothing frozen here! the crepe itself was thick and kept everything in like sandwhich, drizzle the syrup over them and let the yolk crack down onto your crepe. it will be very juicy and its a perfect pairing with the spinach & feta.  The waffles are perfectly cooked on the outside too, and will be the perfect touch to a sweet tooths breakfast craving!"}
{"text":"If you are a chocolate lover then this is your heaven. I had the Mexico choco drink since I am a firm believer that chocolate and chile go hand in hand. I recommend ordering a cup and just sipping it while you navigate the beautiful city of Montréal."}
{"text":"A big fan of desserts and chocolate and this place is as good as it gets.  A coffee shop style seating with wooden tables for large and small groups and is actually quite spacious.  The air is constantly filled with mouth-watering smells of chocolate and waffles.    We tried both matcha and earl grey hot chocolate (holiday special) and it was such a pleasant surprise.I was worried the taste would over power each other but it was absolutely perfect.  A great elegant taste of earl grey in sweet hot chocolate....mhhhmmm!!  Fondue is priced around $11-15 which is great to share between 2 people.  I feel like most places charge over $20 for fondue and sometimes isn't worth it if you really just need a sweet tooth fix.  The waffle/crepes were also just on point with the amount of sweetness and chocolate sauce.  Perfect casual dessert place!"}
{"text":"I've been in there a few times already and it's always been a great experience eating there. The place is quite small but the ambience is quite nice. The service there is really on point and always happy to receive customers. Food wise, to my surprise, is really good. The portions were bigger than I expected. Ex: I ordered a cheesecake crepe and I couldn't even finish it(I'm the type of person to eat a lot). At least they have bigger portions than many other chocolate restaurants. Some stuffs are a little pricy but it's worth the try. Their menu is super organised and understandable. Its not overly exaggerated."}
{"text":"I saw previous reviews before and pretty much everyone was complaining about the wait time but I was lucky because the place was empty so we got amazing service and it was fast.  The girl working there was super great and went beyond to give us the best experience ever. We had a hot chocolate and a single fondue but it's plenty enough for 2 people to share. The wifi was down that day so I believe it might be the reason why it was so quiet because I saw a few people walking out and also the debit machine was down.  The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is this is the only location without a liquor license and we were not aware of this and we went there with Bailey's on our mind. So be aware of that if it is on your mind as well. The waitress told us that the other franchise do have the liquor license."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I did not have a great customer service experience here. My boyfriend and I arrived to this place at opening time, only to be told that they will be opening in 10 minutes as they aren't set up yet (no biggie). We walked around and came back 40 minutes later, only to be told that they will not serve me because the server is running late.. I was pretty upset at the situation but never the less really wanted to try this place as I have a big sugar tooth! Fortunely our friend lives upstairs so we loafted a bit at his place for an hour. We came back downstairs to see that they were in business.   We decided to eat here anyways but what did bother me is that they person who told us that to keep coming back, could have just served us considering that it wasn't busy at all as we were the only persons there.   Anyways I ordered a chocolate waffle it was very delicious! However this place is pricey! I may or may not return to this place but that depends on time."}
{"text":"The entrees here are just average; what really makes Cacao 70 great are the numerous desserts and hot chocolate offerings. I definitely recommend trying one of the milk or dark chocolate fondue options- they include a little bit of everything (waffles, fruit, marshmallows, chocolate fondue and a mini hot chocolate cup). Be sure to ask for the hot chocolate menu which includes dozens of different hot chocolates. This restaurant is a bit pricy, but definitely worth trying-especially if you have a major sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"My husband is addicted to the marshmallow pizza and his mood seemingly improves after a visit to this place, so that's very good. I have been here so many times I think I have mostly tried everything, and my \"only\" complaint is that almost everything tastes the same. Not a lot of variety of flavor, but if you appreciate simplicity on desserts this is your place. Additionally, I prefer Cacao 70 over Juliette. Their milkshakes are tastier and I believe the prices fairer, besides a cozier decoration and a more attractive menu."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place. The interior is very nice and modern. It has a comforting atmosphere where you can stay for hours just chatting. They have an extensive dessert menu. The desserts were great, but the service was mediocre. They appeared to be lacking staff when I was there. It took a long time to get service and at one point, we could see our dessert waffle with ice cream waiting in the kitchen. It sat there for 5 minutes before being served to us and the ice cream had melted. With an adjustment to their staffing requirements, the entire experience would have been better."}
{"text":"The smell from outside, inside. The amazing hot chocolate menue 'wine style* The only complaint is the waiting, it is very popular and shows a line up on a regular basis. Love this concept. Can't go wrong with everything chocolate!!!"}
{"text":"Came by 30 minutes before closing to see if they would still take us and to our surprise, they were more than happy to seat us. We ordered the dark chocolate fondue dessert for two and a hot chocolate on the side. Everything was delicious and we really enjoyed our time there. The food was plentiful and we tried really hard to finish it but clearly, we were way over ourselves and had to roll out. The staff didn't rush us at all - in fact, they told us to take our time while they cleaned up. The place is really nice and spacious but the washrooms are a little but of a hassle to get to. Would definitely come back to try their coffees!"}
{"text":"I went there Sunday for brunch, and I was really disappointed by the food. I ordered the Croque Madame, which was advertised as a sandwich with ham, cheese, fried egg and béchamel sauce, but I got what seemed as a makeshift, effortless version of it... For one, the bread was not buttered or toasted, there was NO béchamel sauce, the cheese was only sliced up and not melted... Instead of the béchamel sauce, they put extra ham and cheese slices on top of the sandwich, which only made the whole thing more salty... At least I had salad, cut up fruits and chocolate dip with my plate to make the meal decent... Anyways, this place is better for desserts, for sure. Will not come back again for brunch."}
{"text":"if you are in Montreal, you need to come to cacao 70. You won't be disappointed with their menu. Everything I eat here is amazing.  Each time I have a friend visiting me, I bring them here. Try the Lazy Breakfast or the black and white crepe for Brunch. You won't regret."}
{"text":"Delicious food, awful service. We got waffles with chocolate and ice cream, and it was amazing. We were seated in the front window, which was good for people-watching, but apparently made us invisible to wait staff (I was 8 months pregnant, so it's hard to be invisible!). We had to flag someone down to take our order, and once our food arrived, we didn't see anyone for the rest of our meal. We had to go get the check and pay, and after my husband left the tip line blank, our crappy waitress had the nerve to come to our table and point out that he left it blank. We said we were leaving cash for tip to get her out of our faces, then took a cue from her and ghosted. Would done at a different location next time because the food was that good."}
{"text":"As a chocolate lover I just had to try this place. The menu looks good and the prices are affordable. The marshmallow pizza is really good and the hot chocolate is the biggest reason why you have to visit Cacao70. I tried the Ghana chocolate (40%) and it was sweet and delicious (9.75$ that I will pay again and again)! It's a great place to come for dessert, and yes, just for dessert. They do have a salted crepe and sandwiches menu but we had to change our order 2x because they didn't have Roast Beef for the roast beef crepe, and no parisienne sauce for the ham crepe (ham, cheese and sauce). I think it's the worst mistake for a restaurant to lack the ingredients to prepare what's on their menu. We end up ordering the breakfast crepe which was nothing special (just eggs and ham with maple syrup on the side - 14$) It felt like I was eating an omelette. The waitress was very nice but the service was a bit slow (maybe because there was only one waitress for the whole room, which was packed). Also because the tables are not organised properly they'll try to sit you right beside people you don't know, which makes it a bit of an uncomfortable experience if you don't like people listening to your conversation the whole night."}
{"text":"Je sais pas si c'est vraiment légal d'appeler ça un déjeuner tellement c'est sucré, mais j'y suis  allée 2 fois et les gaufres sont excellentes! Pas de lineup, une place calme, pas loin du centre-ville où ça sent le chocolat... très appétissant. Pour ceux qui sont moins fan du sucré, les déjeuners salés sont moins nombreux, mais tout aussi bien. J'adore"}
{"text":"Been there with friends for breakfast. Love the food very much! I personally like their the sweet more than savoury."}
{"text":"Well...looks like Juliette et Chocolat has a competitor now..although the charm of J&C  is still my fave, the quality of this place might slightly surpass J&C.  Cacao 70, for those of you who don't know, is a newish chocolate place nestled between du Fort and Chomedy on St Catherines. It's a cute little place with a MASSIVE list of chocolate options ranging from drinks to crepes to ice creams to cakes and even to chocolate pizzas! I've been a handful of times, and each time I push myself to try something new. Happily, I'm never disappointed! It's a little on the pricey side (at ~9 for a hot chocolate), but totally worth it!   Go try it out - I promise you won't be disappointed!  Oh and, they even have savory snacks (amazing sandwiches!)"}
{"text":"First of all the staff in this place are always smiling and welcoming. Service is fairly fast, however in you happen to visit in rush hours you may need to wait a bit. I tried the apple crepe (with extra cinnamon!!) and I loved it. Delicious and healthy I say. The ambience is warm and inviting. I enjoy the woody design."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying that this was the first restaurant we dined at upon arriving in Montreal last Tuesday afternoon.  We were strolling down Mont Royal looking for a tasty place to eat and this fine establishment caught our eye.  We walked in and didn't have to wait long to be seated.  My partner, mother, father, and I shared a booth near the open window.  I must note that it was extremely warm.  The weather outside was pretty unbearable, however being inside did not help much as I don't think they had any AC on at all!    We received three menus.  One had typical breakfast items and sandwiches, one had sweet entrees, and the other had chocolate varieties.  It was a bit overwhelming but there were many pictures of very delicious looking foods - yum!  The nice and pretty waitress came to take our order.  My partner attempted to order a beer, which was on the menu, however the nice and pretty waitress informed us that they don't yet have a liquor license because they're \"new\" and are, therefore, unable to serve him the beer.  This is unacceptable.  If there is beer on the menu, there best be beer in our bellies.  I ordered the vegetarian omelette, which came with a starter of fruits and warm melted chocolate for dipping.  It was strange that the bananas came unpeeled and the strawberries were oddly shaped.  Nonetheless, the warm melted chocolate was delicious!  We waited about 20 minutes for our main dishes to arrive.  My partner and mother ordered the vegetarian sandwich.  My mother is a big fan of bacon, so she decided to add bacon to hers for an extra fee.  However, when her sandwich arrived she described the bacon as \"the same kind they use at Tim Hortons, the kind you microwave\"... Very disappointing for an esteemed restaurant. Soggy bacon is not acceptable.  At this time I would like to say that there was the cutest little child ever sitting at a table by ours. He had a nice watch on and a great haircut.  Best wishes growing up, kid!  Onto a different note, we noticed something a little fishy in the bathrooms.  There were signs in the stalls that requested we put our USED toilet paper in the garbage bins (which were open, without lids) rather than the toilets.  I wonder how sanitary this is... I get it if your toilets aren't working so well but at least get a garbage bin with a lid on it to avoid gross things getting in the air.  Please either get a plumber or rethink your waste management outlook.  I was appalled.   Though our savoury meals were satisfactory, in hindsight I think it would be best to come to Cacao 70 with a sweet tooth, if you know what I mean. Our teeth wanted salty brunch, but Cacao 70 is more suited for someone with teeth interested in something a little more chocolatey, or \"cacao-y\", as they might put it themselves. Overall I'm still not sure how to pronounce \"cacao\" correctly, but this mont-royal chocolate emporium had me thinking \"bring on the sweets!\". A nice start to the vacation in Montreal. I plan to return for a chocolate waffle, or maybe even a piece of chocolate on its own, or fondue or hot chocolate. As soon as they get their plumbing fixed. Maybe it's fixed already, who knows?"}
{"text":"I've visited Cacao 70 on Easter Sunday, I've chosen this location because it is very close to the metro which is great especially during the winter as it avoids long walks. The service was great, the waitress who served me was very professional. I have read many compliments about the decor (and maybe my expectations were high), however, i didn't see anything original about it. I ordered their American Style Hot Chocolate which was succulent as well as their salmon which was served with bread, cream cheese, salad and scrambled eggs... Hum.... I have to say that the eggs were a bit greasy and tasteless, the rest was just a simple salad with salmon and bread nothing that I wouldn't be able to do myself at home. Despite the last part of my review, I would recommend this place because they are specialized in chocolate and honestly they handled that part very well, next time I will stick to the chocolate menu and avoid eating anything that isn't related to their theme."}
{"text":"For someone with not a terribly huge sweet tooth, the options are overwhelming -- from crepes to fondue to shakes, hot chocolate and more.   The spiced hot chocolate (CHOCOLAT CHAUD EPICE - SPECIAL CACAO 70) is supposedly a dark chocolate spiced with paprika, curry, cardamom, and espelette pepper. It was more subtle than I had expected. The flavours were really well balanced and drank rather smoothy, except it definitely is thicker than your joe schmoe powdered hot chocolate mix so it is a bit rich on the palate. $8.75.  Had a bite of the classic crepe with white chocolate (CREPE AU CHOCOLAT CLASSIQUE - AU BLANC) which actually wasn't cloying sweet (contrasted really well with my drink), but it is literally just crepe drizzled with white choc. This one seemed slightly overpriced. $7.50.  Finally, the classic chocolate fondue with dark chocolate (FONDUE AU CHOCOLAT CLASSIQUE - AU CHOCOLAT NOIR) didn't seem anything special. it was served lukewarm in a tall mug and while there was space under the mug for a candle, there was none. Still plenty molten, however, to dip the bits of banana, strawberry, pineapple, brownie, and waffle. The brownie was actually quite delicious on its own (actually more spiced than expected), but dipping it in more chocolate seemed excessive. Waffle squares were not good...could have been omitted. $9.50 for \"simple\" (vs. \"double\" - which i assume to be either two flavours or supersized)  Nice quiet place to hang out, with a patio out in front. Overall I can see this place being pretty exciting for chocolate/dessert lovers but for those just looking for a nibble of sweetness post-dinner, you'll definitely want to share."}
{"text":"This place was packed when I went. Tons of college students. The service was mediocre. They seemed to be having trouble with the high volume of customers.  I tried a waffle and a fondue. The waffle was way too sugary and the ice cream was icy and bland. The fruit (strawberries and bananas) was okay, but overall it was just sugar overload. For how much you pay, I was expecting higher quality food.  Next time I'll head to a bakery for dessert instead."}
{"text":"Service sympa on vous place sur une banquette de quatre confortable même si vous êtes deux le service est rapide en tout cas à 20h30 un samedi -  nous étions la pour un dessert - desserts copieux et jolis beaucoup de choix.  La glace vanille est tellement bonne et le brownie bien chocolaté nous reviendrons avec plaisir"}
{"text":"Cute spot to feed your chocolate cravings!  A friend and I ordered the milk chocolate fondue, it was delicious and creamy. Be aware though, we thought it was a lot of chocolate but the porcelain cup it comes in is actually shallow! You do have the option to order another one, but we found 1 was enough for 2 people for dessert. We also ordered an earl grey tea and a Mexicocoa, which was nice and light.   Lovely interior and atmosphere and the service was okay. We went to the front to pay, it was easier that way, instead of waiting for the server to come to you.   I definitely think it is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Chocolate lovers unite. Stylish chocolate Cafe similar to Juliette st Chocolat in Montreal. Their hot chocolate menu is pretty extensive and each one comes piping hot in a cool goblet. Depending on which chocolate on the chocolate spectrum you order it could be very sweet or bitter, but all will be thick and not some watered down hot chocolate.   Their food items are pretty lame except for the chocolate fondue. It was fun to try once but it's pretty expensive.   Long lineups at night, we came at 9pm and waited for around 20mins for a table of four."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend going here for the chocolate. My friend ordered a hot chocolate with a very rich dark chocolate. It was delicious. I had the triple chocolate fondue. The bowl/cup the chocolate is in is deceiving. You think you have more chocolate left than you really do but it's only a concave opening at the top. So conserve your chocolate for your entire fondue. We arrived at the right time because shortly afterwards it became very busy. The service wasn't the best. Even after we were finished it took us a while to get a check and pay."}
{"text":"This place is amazing in Montreal but terrible in Toronto. Nothing against the food but the servers are probably the worst I have ever experienced in the city.  There would be five empty tables and the wait staff would still think it's appropriate to any seat people when 20-25 gather up at the front. By that time, you have already been waiting ten minutes staring at the empty tables wondering if you should just sit yourself down before they actually even give anyone any attention. It's appalling how you have to chase down a server to be seated, and then be told that people who came in after you were here before you and they can \"only do one thing at a time\".  Absolutely terrible and horrendously mismanaged. You are better off going to any other cafe in the Distillery than Cocoa 70."}
{"text":"ok I was walking by this place, saw it, and had to go in! It's all about chocolate!!! Everything on the menu looked amazing but we ended up getting the Sweet Chocolate Experience for Two - it came with marshmallows for us to roast on our table (!!!), chocolate fondue, strawberries, bananas, chocolate cereal, waffle with chocolate, ice cream, and got chocolate. Wow!  Roasting marshmallows is great. Backyard fire pits are illegal in Toronto so this is a great option for getting your marshmallow fix.   I think the waffle with chocolate and ice cream was the best waffle I've ever had.   This place is great for an after dinner dessert, or for brunch, or an afternoon treat, or anytime you're craving chocolate."}
{"text":"Le mexicacao un délice.  Seule chose à considérer en cette fin d'hiver un nettoyage des pieds de tables des planchers et des vitres. Ajouterai à une expérience plus \"clean \" sinon vive Cacao70"}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend this place if you're really having a chocolate craving. It definitely hits the spot. The milk chocolate fondue is fantastic, as well as countless other items. Would definitely recommend. Service can be a tad slow at times."}
{"text":"We wanted to order takeout as my 85 year old father in law was worn out from a day of walking around Montreal. So our plan was for my wife to order takeout while my son and I walked there.  Turns out the employee hung up on my wife when she tried to explain why she wanted to order.  (I learned this when I got home.)  So we enter the restaurant and I said \"my wife called in an order\" and the guy rolled his eyes and said \"no\" and walked away.  I realize my phone is buzzing and my wife just texted me what happened and texted our order to me.  So unhappily we will start from scratch.  Several minutes later the guy comes back and says well do you want to order and I say yes and then say \"but I'm still confused why you can't take an order with a credit card\" and he says \"because people like you won't show up\".  I couldn't figure out if he meant American or Anglo or something else.  So I go to read the order from my phone and he simply walks away again.  We go through this two more times (and I got stern...my kids call it daddy tone) and he does the same rude thing...asking if I want to order but walking away when I try. And he kept calling us names under his breath. We definitely heard \"Jesus...f*@king a@@holes\".  The other is far more offensive based upon the religion he perceived us to be but I will leave that out since we are not positive he said it.  (I\"ll give him the benefit of the doubt.)  I then called the Atwater location to see if we can do takeout from there. The employee there said we could but said I should talk to the manager at the Parc location. The same rude guy at Parc said there is no manager; I ask for the manager's name so the next day I can send an email.  He says he won't give out the name of the manager because it is private.  I said first name is fine if there is a concern.  He said \"I'm not giving it to you.\"  The staff does not wear name tags and he wouldn't give his name either.   We left and went to the Atwater location to get our takeout.  (I gave them a five star review.  Great staff.)  I think Cacao 70 has an issue on its hands.  Given the diversity of the neighborhood around Parc and Montreal as a whole I think they want to be careful with the offensive prejudices of the staff and the treatment of customers."}
{"text":"Came here after the Parc location refused to take our order.  (I think my offense was being a 50 something American dad.). So took an Uber with my youngest son to pick up desserts for the entire family.  Staff was professional, courteous, and upbeat.  Food was amazing.  This will be our go to location for sure!"}
{"text":"It was very busy and I just popped in to see what it was like. The atmosphere is great and I will be back again.  I got the hot chocolate and I thought that I was great. I would recommend going here for any craving wether it be for something savoury or sweet. There is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Omg. Chocolate heaven. Just go!  We got the chocolate fondue with strawberries, bananas, chocolate crispy things, waffles, drinking chocolate, and ice cream. It was worth every calorie."}
{"text":"Been to this place several times. The service is good and the place is quite clean. If you love chocolate and sweets but also want to eat something salty because you're a reasonnable person who doesn't just eat sweets for a main meal, this place is great. They have both. From brunch and salads to milkshake and crepes, their menu has many varieties."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and was very impressed with the customer service. The particular hostess/also server (forgot her name) made us feel welcome and helped us order some of the more underrated menu items since there were so much to choose from!   Got the vintage hot chocolate to start, husband got the champurado. Both were so creamy and chocolatey!   Split a ham sandwich which was the perfect size to split since we were saving room for dessert. The sandwich did it's job. It was a regular sandwich but the mustard used was pretty good!!  For \"dessert\" we got the Nutella ricotta pizza. It was amazing!!! Our server recommended it and we loved every bite. The bread was soft, the Nutella was still warm, and I'm not a fan of ricotta but it went so well with the Nutella. The dessert wasn't overly sweet either. Totally recommend this."}
{"text":"Got the frozen chocolate here to go. Lacks richness/flavour. Huge chucks of ice instead of smaller ones. Did not blend enough. After a few sips, it was basically a cup of ice"}
{"text":"have been here twice and both times were for chocolate fondue and coffee. convenient location for me and a nice place to hang out and chat with friends, while enjoying some chocolately goodness"}
{"text":"The fondue was a good portion for the price and really good, although some things look a bit expensive for what they're offering other things look like unique offerings. I personally would not spend ten bucks on drinking chocolate. The service was a mix of competence and incompetence depending on the employee."}
{"text":"I went here for a date night with someone who loves hot chocolate, so we added this spot to our places to hit up.   I appreciated that it was open later than other cafe-esque places, so we were able to settle in after a nice dinner elsewhere. We were seated pretty quickly near the back, where I have to say it was pretty cozy. The place was pretty full, so we had high expectations. At the time, they had their winter drink specials so I got the matcha white hot chocolate and he got the American style hot chocolate.   When our drinks came, I of course had to take a million instagrammable (and yelp-able) photos. But when we took the first sip, neither of our drinks were particularly hot and I don't think they could have cooled down that much in the photo-taking process. The matcha flavor was definitely there but no bitter aftertaste due to the sweet white hot chocolate (only get this if you really have a sweet tooth). Apparently the American style hot chocolate was nothing to rave about, and did not taste enough like milk chocolate. I guess if you like dark chocolate it'd be better for you? But then again, that's to be expected at a specialty chocolate place.   Overall, I liked my experience here because of the company and cozy vibes. I wouldn't particularly come back for the drinks or food, but that's also because I'm not a huge chocolate person. I'll probably stick to my coffee.   If you like chocolate and have the money to spend, this place would be worth checking out once! They do varieties of desserts, drinks, chocolate crepes and pizzas, etc. Less intimidating desserts than Demetres, which really does the chocolate cakes, milkshakes, ice creams, etc."}
{"text":"Cuteness overload. The front is a chocolate shop and the back is a restaurant good for brunch. The smell of chocolate wafts through the air leaving you hungry for sweets.   Got the nutella and strawberry/banana crepe- portion was huge. It was exactly what I expected and wanted. My bf got the orange grand marnier crepe, which was good, but drenched in too much sugar. It was too heavy and I think I would have gotten sick from eating the entire thing (good thing he's a piggy and ate it all).   The way they make the food here was like artwork. We sat by the open kitchen and watched the chefs skillfully drizzle chocolate on each crepe and decorate each dish to perfection. I think it was a fun experience to try it out, however, balancing a sweet dish with a salty one would have been smart."}
{"text":"Just a great place for brunch! Ordered crepe, smoothies, and Montreal breakfast. All just great. Preceded by a complimentary appetizer of fruits with hot chocolate for dipping - a nice surprise."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.. however they could have been a tad bit larger. The pictures looked a lot different from what I actually got. Also the washrooms were not well kept. I would return but just have in mind what to expect."}
{"text":"La place parfaite pour manger un dessert a montreal ! On a pris le milkshake au cheese cake et pumpkin spice est c'etait troooop bon  j'imagine que la place est tres bien pour dejeuner aussi !"}
{"text":"I took a bunch of friends here during their visit to Montreal. It was around 9:30pm on a Saturday, and there was no line up! Hurray! The decor has a bit of a modern twist to it in comparison to its st, catherine location near metro atwater. The bakers or cooks are in the middle - a very visible location for anyones entertainment. Trust me, it's fun to watch how they make all the dessert art. It's also MUCH more spacier - which is good!  I ordered the white and milk chocolate fondue, while my friends ordered the strawberry crepe, caramel milkshake, and hot chocolate. I would say the quality is comparable to their other locations. My friend wanted to try their chocolate alcohol, but we learned from our waitress that they were still waiting for their liquor license. I'm not sure how long it takes, but our visit was recent, so if you're there for those items you might want to try a different location.   Servers were nice, our waitress was courteous and always came around to ask us how our food was. She was also very prompt with our requests."}
{"text":"I still love going to Cacao70, but I think one thing I forgot to mention is the wait time. I was lucky that I only waited 20 minutes to get a seat. However, I was only with my partner. So  if you have a bigger group - it's definitely going to take a little longer. You want to take that into account. I believe the other locations (e.g. around Berri-Uqam) isn't as packed. But if you intend to meet here with a group of friends for, say 9pm, I recommend coming at least 15 minutes earlier.  This time I went, my partner got a marshmallow and chocolate pizza, while I got the choco-nut waffle with ice cream. We always see people ordering the pizza, but I guess the idea never really sunk in to order one before. Definitely an interesting experience. Dough is basically pizza dough (I was expecting pastry) - with roasted marshmallows and drizzled chocolate. Mmm so good, but so filling. I don't know how he finished it. Especially since it comes paired with fruits and another mini-fondue of dark chocolate.   As for my order - I loved the waffles as always. I also love the nuts on top - crunchy and sweet. The cream and ice cream melted really fast, and I'm not exactly the fastest eater - so my partner was taking bites here and there from my dish. I am definitely loyal to the Banana Split waffle - something about the caramelized sugar that seriously makes me drool. I do love how they also gave me fruit and mini-fondue though."}
{"text":"Groupe de 7 a 20h ... commandez un sandwich jambon , goût ok , servit seul avec rien autres dans l'assiette ( peut etre avions nous pas bien vu le menu ou le comprendre ) le dessert un parfait brownies choco framboise étais succulent! Les verres eau tachés de calcaire pour plusieurs serait à revérifié de plus nous servons notre eau nous même ( ce qui derange pas ) bref le total de 19.55$ pour un sandwich & dessert . Je vais revenir pour essayer  un repas complet sucré."}
{"text":"As soon as you step into Cacao 70, the smell of chocolate hits you and its the most glorious feeling. If you're a fan of chocolate like I am then you'll like Cacao before you even eat anything. There are specials that rotate every so often, and you can often find it advertised on the walls of the restaurant.  We were seated quickly and we actually ordered off their brunch menu and then got one dessert to share. Just based off of my experience, the breakfast was very mediocre and I would not recommend it. If you're coming to a speciality chocolate restaurant, order something with chocolate, you won't regret it. The chocolate menu is extensive and it includes almost everything your chocolate craving heart would desire. It includes crepes, waffles, cakes, cheesecakes, ice cream sundaes, hot chocolates, mochas, fondues and so many more. Next time, I'd go there on an empty stomach and order just desserts!  We ordered the triple chocolate fondue and it was SOooOoOoO good. We ordered the single size and it was perfect for us to share. The chocolate was warm and it came with waffles, brownies, and assorted fruit for us to dip. The little cup that the chocolate fondue comes in was pretty deceiving because it looks like its super deep and holds a ton of chocolate but in reality its a shallow bowl. Still plenty to dip all our dippables.  Will definitely be returning !"}
{"text":"Tried to come here at 10:34pm on a weekday, their website says they close at 11pm. I traveled from pretty far but the person on the phone said they already turned away customers strictly at 10:30pm . I even said I would give him my order over the phone and promise to be out by 11pm, he said no. I ended up doing take-out of the choco-nut waffle, I assembled it myself and drizzled the chocolate as fancy as I could. I ate it outside right in front of the store (took me 10 min). Is it just me or is everything just average? There was waffle, chocolate, banana, ice cream, candied nuts. All of these things were rather basic and together it was just OK, the nuts were the only unique thing but there wasn't that much. Maybe the pizza and hot chocolate is what is unique? Otherwise I can go to Demetres (actually better and cheaper now that I think about it), D-Spot, Spins etc. Nothing special here."}
{"text":"Posting the Byward Market - Ottawa location review here.  Cacao 70 2nd Day opening - nice concept, thanks for opening in the Byward Market!!  Toronto next?  I think this would be BIG in Los Angeles Market - Irvine, Costa Mesa, Rowland Heights, Hermosa Beach, Santa Monica, Old town Pasadena??  maybe franchise it out?  This is a chocolate lovers dream cafe...no calorie count posting!!  Good service, by Adam.  Loved the Chocolate Fondue.  Good Luck Ottawa, hope to visit on my next trip.  Get the Ottawa Yelp location updated!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite place to eat in Montreal!    When I stumbled on this little gem online the fat girl in me was ridiculously ecstatic!  A restaurant that served mostly chocolate?!  I was sure I'd died and gone to heaven.  It was recommended for brunch or dessert(can't figure out why), so I thought my daughter and I could go there after the half marathon.  Wrong.  I was too tired after the half and went back to the apartment to sleep.  When we woke up we figured chocolate for dinner was the perfect post race reward.    They don't take reservations on weekends.  We arrived around 8 pm on the Sunday night to a small line.  We waited.  Glad we got there when we did because that line quickly grew.  I knew we'd made a good dining choice when people waited in that long line.    After maybe a 15 to 20 minute wait we were seated.  Our waitress kept coming around to take our orders, but we were so overwhelmed with all the chocolate options we didn't know where to start.  Finally we started on beverages.  I ordered a chocolate raspberry soda and my daughter got the chocolate orange one.  They were so tasty!  All my sodas should be chocolate!    We finally decided on meals.  My daughter got the the Black & White Waffle and I chose the Banana and Nutella crepe.  Afterwards I wished I picked raspberry instead of banana as I can get the banana kind here in Calgary(although not as good... not gonna lie).  However, I loved it.  It was a huge serving and was delicious!  So much nutella and lots of banana.  My daughter's waffles was huge with a scoop of chocolate ice cream, whipped cream, black & white chocolate sauce and little chocolate crisps.  I managed to eat all mine.  My daughter maybe ate 1/3 of hers.  We split the rest for breakfast the next day!    We were hoping to split a dessert(yes, on top of chocolate loaded dinner), but that did not happen.  We were much too full."}
{"text":"One of several Cocoa 70 localities in the city including the production facility. The chocolate is processed wonderfully you can even purchase their bars in a variety of percentages of cocoa at each location .The location on Av du Parc has a pleasant and attentive staff who speak French and English. The location was not busy for a Saturday afternoon which was a concern at first. We were brought a bottle of water to start for the table. The menu is simple with a wide variety of savory and desert crepes to chose from. We had the Strawberry and Cheese cake as well as the Crepe with banana and chocolate sauce with whipped cream. The cheesecake filling was delicate and creamy. As well as an Americano coffee. The location takes credit or cash. There is good paid parking on the street."}
{"text":"Remember that time in the mid 2000's before smartphones, before laptops had all day batteries that turned these cats into coffee shop refugees?   There weren't starbucks and timmies all over Montreal back then. We had these lesser known local joints you would meet up  at with your girl and that was the only place in town like it.   Cacao 70 is an old school style local business. They still write their specials on a chalk board on the wall. The wifi password is up there now too, but when you look around, there's folks having conversations, friendly staff that aren't up in your face.  They still make a decent cup of espresso here.  To my knowledge they don't have one in Toronto yet. Cacao 70 still belongs to Montrealers in that sense.  The customer experience is legit. Cozy woody decor, lending the place an \"urban cabin\" vibe, the seating is comfortable,  background music isn't intrusive or too loud. You'll be comfortable here.   You'll fit in just as well in your hoodie, jeans and joggers as you would after work in your business casual.  As world city culture and urban nomadism spreads, I believe spots like this will become fewer and far between.  The rate Cacao 70 is going, the shop always has patrons, they've already opened up a 2nd location on Parc, but make no mistake, it all started right here near Atwater, in this still slightly dingy part of town.  What's the difference between C70 and Juliette? Everybody goes to Juliette, Juliette is where you're supposed to go.  C70 is where you go if you know it. If you prefer, the slightly quieter, chill place to the  number one famous place.  One day it might be a big chain with Cacao 70's in any city.  Come try it. Look around, chat with the staff, ask and learn about their local chocolate.  Enjoy these small, special moments while they last."}
{"text":"For sweet or salty treats!  Recommended!  We had the fondue, Crepes, Omelets.  If you like Hot chocolate look for the special formula"}
{"text":"This place was the right choice for a seriously cold night!  There were tons of choices on the hot chocolate menu, I opted for one of the dark hot chocolates with a spice blend (there are two on the menu but unfortunately they didn't have my first choice) and it was very good. Very creamy and rich and the spices really put it over the edge. It's about $10 for a cup which is a lot more than I normally would like to pay for hot chocolate but to be fair, the mugs are huge. I didn't really see a need for such a huge portion and actually couldn't finish which is rare for me.  There are also tons of options for different desserts (all chocolate of course) and the staff are very friendly. Would have rated 4/5 if not for the price but overall a very good experience! I would go back to try some of the desserts for sure but maybe only for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is how you do business right. Nice place, great food and drink, knowledgable and energetic staff, and consistency. Keep it up guys this is why you are always full."}
{"text":"Large menu selection that's fairly priced. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Even after leaving my umbrella there they kept it on the side for me to pickup later on. We came at the end of the shift (11pm) and the stag was still friendly . Their hours are great here as o stated before it was 11 pm on a week day! Perfect for getting dessert. They are located right on Saint Cathrine street so it's not easily missed. The inside is cute and trendy; and very clean. You can smell the chocolate and sugar upon opening the door and entering. They also offer free wifi! Always a bonus I would recommend to anyone wanted good dessert in the Montreal area for sure ! It has all of the dessert types you would want in one place , waffles , icecream, fondue , crepes, drinks etc.    Came back here again for breakfast and the omelets were amazing !! Also we had another great staff experience with having Alejandro!! He made sure our order  was made perfect, he helped translate the menu to English for us , and was super friendly !!"}
{"text":"I visited Cacao 70 again tonight, and was again astonished by the quality/originality of their desserts!  This time, I ordered the triple chocolate pizza, and didn't regret my choice AT ALL.  Scrumptious sweet, indeed. I literally died inside!  My clothes might be slightly tighter tomorrow morning, but every single bite was worth it! :)  This place is a GEM! The ambiance is very laid-back (great music), and the service makes you want to come back to taste some more of their baked goods. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Better than Juliette et Chocolat in service and atmosphere! Better than chez Cora in quality! If you are a true lover of chocolate than this place is for you! And shoutout to Shane who was super friendly and genuinely cared about customers and cacao70! Also I love how you built your menu! How you serve people with the cutlery and napkins . How you provide water, you make sure that the customer doesn't feel like they hassle the employees because they have everything they need from the get go! This is like the grown up version of Juliette! Not to say the other places are not good! It's just that this place a a little edge over them! Great job! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Costly but worth it!! We really liked this place. My partner is not sweet tooth but in Cacao 70 he loved each bite. We enjoyed our visit!"}
{"text":"We've already been to Cacao 70 in Toronto so in Montreal it was a must visit for us. I chose this place for our anniversary celebration and I asked one of the staff to make it special by writing anniversary wish on our waffle plate but she said that she'll ask the chef if they can do it...few minutes later she came back and said that they can't but they can arrange a candle. So yes the day was special and of course we love chocolate so it was a bonus and I again fell in love with Cacao 70. Fondue is a must have and yes Hot chocolate on a cold day!!"}
{"text":"Cool spot in Montreal. We had never been so decided to get the sampler -- My favorite was the banana split waffle (so bomb). My friend said she really liked the fondu and pizza.  Also... Thank you for having an English menu :)"}
{"text":"the chocolate is bomb af but the waiters are too slow even on an empty night :(   highly recommend the crepes but dont get the chocolate pizza it tastes weird 1/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"One star for terrible service.  We came here for a late brunch on our last day in Montreal. No complaints about the food. I liked the fresh fruit and melted chocolate that comes with the brunch platters. Nice balance to the savoury sandwich I had. I had the open faced chicken and egg sandwich which was quite good. Chocolate pizza was pretty good as far as the chocolate goes but the dough was a bit thick and overwhelmed the chocolate.  We were seated at a tiny table which would have been fine if we were drinking two mugs of hot chocolate. However, the plates for brunch platters and the chocolate pizza are enormous. You can really only fit 1 plate comfortably and 2 if you really squeeze. Our server brought out the fresh fruit and melted chocolate part of the brunch platter first. Within 5 minutes, before I had finished the fruit, they brought out NOT the rest of the brunch (i.e. sandwich and omelette) but the chocolate pizza. We thought it odd to serve the sweet stuff first before brunch but ok, whatever. We worked on the chocolate pizza. AGAIN, in less than 5 minutes, the server showed up to announce that the brunch entrees were out but that they would wait until the table gets cleared up a bit more after we finish the pizza. Clearly our food was getting cold at the pass while we tried to eat the pizza as fast as we can. Before we could finish the pizza, the server just came out with the brunch plates and put them down on the table anyway despite just announcing earlier that he would wait. At this point, the plates were spilling over the edges of our tiny table and we are literally contorting ourselves trying to eat. The napkins had nowhere to go and our server just tossed them on top of the FOOD and rushed away. Needless to say we were completely flabbergasted by this terrible treatment that was completely non-sensical. Even when we had finished the pizza, our server ignored our table and did not take away the stone so that we could have more room with our plates.  Would never go back."}
{"text":"On the pricey side however the atmosphere is cute and cozy. I've been here a couple of times and the service is A+.  -Good for brunching -The chocolate pizza is awesome -The crepes are decently large and quite good -Don't bother getting the sandwiches other things on their menu are a lot better and these are overpriced  It is a chocolate infused restaurant, so try something along those lines and dont be disappointed that their real food isnt up to your expectations."}
{"text":"I could definitely picture being in college and being taken here for a second date. I call it \"romantic-cafe casual\" because it has a very college coffee shop feel to it and well since they do have fondue, chocolate, and whipped cream--whats more romantic than that?  I, on the other hand, came with the boyfriend post-Saturday brunch. We were stuffed after eating at Bon Vivant (which is an amazing restaurant btw) and wanted to try this joint for its  dessert. The fondue itself was OK--it came with fruits, waffle pieces and a whole brownie. We ordered the single size, and since we already ate, this was the perfect size for us. The brownie was so rich and dense, and actually really good! I would rate the place 3.5 stars for the idea of it (a chocolate haven for us chocolate lovers). The menu is extensive--seriously a booklet of chocolate treats. Thankfully I did not go to school in the area or else I would have overdosed in chocolate here :)"}
{"text":"Amazing chocolate heaven. There are savoury options for those who are in the mood but I fully recommend taking advantage of the superb chocolate treats. I have shared the triple chocolate fondue, a banana split waffle, Black and white crepe, frittata (which is huge... your own skillet of frittata), and more. I love that many dishes come with an appetizer of melted chocolate and fruit. If you're not in the mood for a huge chocolate feast, this should still give you enough to be happy."}
{"text":"It's hard to give a good recommendation to this place yet but I will be trying after only one visit.   I am not a chocolate person and I am not a huge fan of overly sweet things. Things just to keep in mind. The location we visited is in the distillery district. We got the individual chocolate fondues in earl grey and matcha.   The fondues from out taste is that they are most likely white chocolate as they were on the sweet side. There is a good portion on brownies bites, waffle bites, strawberries, bananas, and pineapple. It give a good balance to the experience. I found the brownie perhaps unnecessary unless you're going to get a more bitter or dark chocolate fondue (which we did not). The rest went well with the fondue, the tartness of the fruit helped to cut the sweetness. The earl grey flavour comes though much better than the matcha does due to the sweetness.   I think there is promise to the food here and we will likely come back to try one of the fondues for two sharing plates.   The service was relatively quick despite the busy nature of the store. They had a bench seating area for you to park you butt as you waited to be seated at a table. The servers are attentive enough and don't hover. Our server actually rushed over to us as we made our way to pay at the counter. It was endearing and you can see the effort they put into trying to be there for you despite the lack of staff."}
{"text":"Chocolate-y drinks and dishes, really well crafted delivered in a comfortable ambiance. I don't think you can go wrong here."}
{"text":"What a place!  I loved loved the concept and the way it was setup! I hope they expand out to Vancouver!  Great chocolate based \"dessert parlor\"!! We went in late and I had the hot chocolate and the chocolate cake (re-imagined in a smoothie glass)!  The hot chocolate had options for white, dark or milk chocolate and I got the milk chocolate. Man-o-man... It was perfect, so smooth, creamy and it was amazing. I could have easily had a few more but we all know about our friend Mr. Diabetus...  As for the chocolate cake, I felt it was freshly done because the chocolate on the edges and in between the layers were just the right amount and the whipping cream on top was perfect! It was a perfect size and I really enjoyed the textures! The cake was not soggy, which leads me to believe that they would have to put it together fair often but overall 10/10!"}
{"text":"This location is perfect for a cold winter evening located centrally downtown (right  by the atwater metro-walking distance). I came here on a Monday afternoon around 4:30 pm- I didn't need reservations-as the place was pretty empty. I was served right away with menus/water- which was nice. When we were actually ready to order- nobody came by to check up on us- so I literally had to flag down someone behind the counter to tell them we were ready to order.  We ordered the : the savoury waffle (4/5) that came with ham, 2 sunny side up eggs, roasted mushroom, onions, white cheddar, bechamel sauce and maple syrup. This was plenty for a 2 people or a very hungry person (like me). The egg was a nice touch balancing out the maple syrup - sweet and savoury; the strawberry goat cheese salad (3/5) presentation was beautiful, but the portion size compared to the price of the meal was too small-salads are suppose to be filling! This would work as a side, not as a main course.  For drinks: I had the champurrado (3/5)- a spicy dark hot choclate with a kick of cinammon topped with whip cream. It was a very nice drink, but since I am not a fan of dark chocolate- I couldn't finish the drink.; my friend had the tea- which was generic tea.  The prices were reasonable with service tip.  I am looking forward to trying out there dessert pizzas during my next visit!!"}
{"text":"I been here a couple of times and it's always consistent  One of my favourite place to go when I'm craving something sweet.  The chocolate is not too sweet and it's rich and creamy  I love the concept of having an option of a small fondue or fondue to share with others  Definitely a good place to hang out with friends or go on a date :)"}
{"text":"An awesome place to go to when you want to treat yourself. Simple and pretty decor, huge windows with a nice view of the distillery district buildings, and most importantly, awesome waffles!  I had an after-party waffle and it made my day  Coffee is not the best but it's pretty decent.  The only con is that it's pricey, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"This chocolate experience was divine. I went with the Belgian beans and ALMOST finished all of my cacao. That is actually a pretty impressive accomplishment IMHO because the servings are quite generous. If you know someone who loves hot chocolate and or chocolate in general, do them a favour and introduce them to this place."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekday around 4pm. There were only two other customers, and yet it took 15 minutes for them to take our order. The service is pretty nonexistent. We ordered a Nutella crepe with fresh fruits: raspberries and strawberries. The crepe was TERRIBLE. Both my boyfriend and I are French, and he is from Brittany (where crepes come from). This was not at all a \"Breton\" crepe like it claimed. The crepe was very thick (almost pancake like) and VERY rubbery. Really the worst crepe we've ever had.   My boyfriend ordered the hot chocolate. He said it was really good, but not hot."}
{"text":"The menu looked great. Ended up getting the waffles. They were pretty soggy and mushy immediately and didnt really have any flavor. I would try something else on the menu next time."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience with great service. Must confess we came for L'Avenue but switch due to the line up. Was  unsure of due to the reviews but so glad we came. The food was outstanding and service was very good. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled on in here 7 minutes before they were done taking orders -- yes, I remember the waitress specifically saying I had 7 minutes left to order. I wouldn't call that the most humble welcoming, but it's fine. It didn't bother me much because I was too out of it to care.   I ordered a nutella crepe, and just like anything involving nutella, it was amazing. The crepe was perfect, not burnt and not undercooked. The nutella was rich and they aren't stingy with their serving of it either.  Cacao 70 is any chocolate-lovin'-sweet-tooth addict's heaven. You won't be disappointed!  Fuhrealz."}
{"text":"came here 6/25/17, got the volcano. pretty average stuff. looks pretty but pretty average tasting. could have had a bigger dollop of icec ream that was covered in 4 feet of whipped cream. this is not a real dessert place. but you can get dessert here."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch not too long ago to the queen street location. It was AMAZING! Loved their mocha and crepes! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Grosse déception ! J'étais habitué et content du Cacao 70 de la rue Sainte-Catherine, mais là...  La nourriture était correcte mais le service laissait à désirer : il y avait manifestement un problème en cuisine entraînant un temps  d'attente élevé et plutôt que de nous l'indiquer à notre arrivée (ce qui a été fait pour certains clients), nous avons patienter 25 minutes pour nos boissons chaudes et près d'une heure pour l'assiette..."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with some friends, and it was a great experience! The menu is full of chocolatey-goodness, and their brunch menu is quite extensive as well.  As I had already eaten something before I met up with my friends (OOPS), I ordered a strawberry white chocolate milkshake. It was served cold, and it was VERY creamy in a good way. The strawberry flavour really came out and I was a little sad when it was finished.   After my milkshake, I couldn't help myself and I ordered a parfait as well. DELICIOUS.   The service was great and I look forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"Always thought I had a sweet tooth, but this place is just sweets overkill lol. Nonetheless, it is a cool dessert place that has all kinds of different chocolates to choose from around the world. It is kind of pricy, but thats normal for the distillery. The staff were pretty friendly, and our orders came fairly quick.   Bottom line is, if you're a true chocolatier aficionado, you'll enjoy this place. But if you're a uni student looking for a cheap date, stick to demetres lol."}
{"text":"The food was good but we felt strongly discriminated against by server/manager Sarah.   When we walked into the restaurant, it was mostly empty. When we requested to sit at a larger table, she replied: \"If you want to sit there I will have to split the table\". After we sat down at a small table, we noticed that every single couple here had a larger table. The table she refused to give us was then promptly given to another couple who came less than ten minutes later. It was very strange and unprofessional.   We understand that restaurants need to save space, but at least be consistent. We were the only couple among five to have a small table despite requesting for larger one. Indeed, there were several larger tables empty the entire time we were there!   Sarah has one of the worst attitudes I've ever encountered in years, it's legendary. She might not be a bad person, but she lacks the most basic understanding of her job function and the service industry.   The services at this restaurant has almost always be very pleasant but it's too bad that she ruined the entire dining experience this time.   If the owner of the restaurant sees my comment, you are welcome to contact me for verification and more details. Don't let your great restaurant be ruined by a few incompetent staff members."}
{"text":"Great customer service. The waitress was nice and attentive.  The food was memorable, not because it was great, but because it was lackluster.  I ordered the Lazy Breakfast after seeing pictures of it on the Yelp app. My food did not look like the pictures. The chorizo was cut in small slices and I was only given 4 pieces. I told the waitress and she got me about 4 more little pieces. She agreed that my portion was rather small, but what she gave me to compensate wasn't really a compensation. The were also skimpy with the baked beans. It had to be a portion size of about a single tablespoon.  I ordered a hot chocolate and it had a gritty and thick texture.  I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and both times have had very poor service. Even though the place was not crowded no one bothered to seat us for 10 mins of waiting by the door. Then they seated us way in the back and the corner. Came to take and deliver our order after much time had passed. Constantly came to check on other customers in the area. Once our omelette was served the waiter asked if we wanted hot sauce. To which I said yes. He never came to give us hot sauce so by then I finished the meal sans salt or pepper. Makes me think it had something to do with the colour of our skin because we got the same run down at the Distillery District location. I thought this was Canada. I gotta say amazing food and drinks but do you think that makes up from crap service or just crap service to us."}
{"text":"Do you want Chocolate everything?  And I do mean almost everything.  It's like someone decided to single handedly support the chocolate market by opening this store so that Canadian chocolate lovers could get their fix.  And this place is their dealer.  Decent chocolate at average to above average prices.  Crepes and waffles seem to be the popular thing here, but you know me, I'm all about the hot chocolate.  After walking in the snow, who wouldn't want hot chocolate?  Now all I need is a toboggan and a backpack for my adventure through Montreal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to chill in Montreal. Its the perfect palace for students and anyone who appreciates chocolate and its many forms. The fondue is the most popular thing on the menu, highly recommended, service is great but after 6 and during weekends can result in lineups near the door."}
{"text":"This place definitely is a good place to hangout with your buddies. The ambiance is great and the servers are helpful. Also, the food looks really well presented and very instagram worthy. However, everything I've tried so far is nothing special and pretty standard food you can find in many other places."}
{"text":"Don't waste you time here. The staff was friendly but the food left a lot to desired. We had to send a few utensils and dishes back for being dirty. We dinned here as our second option since the line for the restaurant across the street was too long. We would've been better waiting in the long line. The food was not worth the $$$"}
{"text":"I ordered one of the favorite menu items, dark melted chocolate with a side hot chocolate ($10 + tax/tip). The melted dark chocolate was small in quantity but exactly what you'd expect it to taste like. I was expecting the hot chocolate to be bland in comparison but it was surprisingly quite rich, and very sweet... Definitely satisfied my sweet craving, but I wouldn't call it good value.  Food: 3/10 Service: minus 1 star  I typically do not penalize for service, however the attitude here is exactly what's wrong with many Montreal establishments. I had a bad feeling before even ordering. The waitress was obviously more concerned with flirting her male colleague than serving customers. I had to wait quite a long time before being seated, wait quite a long time before getting the menu, make multiple fiery eye contacts before being approached. Menu placed on the table with her back turned away. Same with water. After finishing my chocolate, I put my credit card on the table and fired several rounds of eye contacts to no avail, only seeing her pass by multiple times while looking away. I finally flagged her down and said \"can i have the bill?\" before she came back and grabbed my card while continuing to look at the guy behind the counter. I once again shot fiery glances at the girl when going out, obviously without any sort of greeting. I get that the typical clientele is distracted couples or large groups who don't care about fast personable service, but that's not an excuse to abuse customers. I kinda wish she didn't give me a receipt so that I can report their ass to Revenu Quebec.  Not impressed. Neither by the food quality nor service. The execution is just inferior to Juliette & Chocolat on so many levels. Avoid."}
{"text":"To my fellow chocoholics - Behold! Paradise!  ((Just a tid bit - when I rate a place 5 stars it means that not only was the service, food, and prices excellent, but the place instills the meanest of mean cravings in me. It means that after I'm done eating I already want to go back and order something else.))  That is what Cacao 70 did to me.  I am a chocoholic - a cocoa Fiend. My phone is protected by a chocolate bar phone case - Just to give you an idea of my love for cocoa.   I acquainted our waitress with my addiction. I ordered Mexican Hot Chocolate (rich chocolate with cayenne pepper to add to the kick; absolutely divine), Nutella crepe with bananas (very large portion, can be shared between two people - simply yes!), and a chocolate cake (the weakest link, but still delicious) - the waitress looked shocked and asked if all of that was for me to which I ecstatically replied \"Yes!\". She said she had to forewarn me that it's a lot of food, but I told her I still wanted everything I ordered.   She was right about the portion sizes - I had my work cut out for me, but I demolished everything. I was in Cocoa heaven. She came back later to pick up my empty plates and saw my chocolate covered phone and said \"Now it makes sense\". She also apologized in case she offended me, but she hadn't.  It's probably a good I don't have a Cacao 70 nearby, I'd honestly go broke and possibly gain 10 lbs a week.   Great for groups - especially like a ladies night or a date night. Just order dessert - it's Cacao 70 - it says it in the name - stick with something chocolatey and I doubt you can go wrong!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dessert, and was definitely not disappointed. Loved the simple, yet comforting decor. The waitress was super friendly and was really helpful when we asked her questions regarding the different types of chocolate. They brought out a tiny sip of hot chocolate and a bite of waffle to sample before we even ordered which was nice. We ended up splitting a banana, strawberry, and 55% belgian chocolate crepe. IT WAS ENORMOUS. We contemplated ordering two but thank god we didn't. It literally covered (and overflowed off) the plate. So glad we listened to the waitress's recommendation to order the 55% chocolate over the Nutella. The chocolate was just sweet enough to complement the fruit nicely. Best of all, the crepe was only $8.50! What a deal. Definitely a great place to pop in for dessert!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for chocolate lovers :)! Huge menu with all kinds of dishes, sweet and salty. Generous portions too, so you'll for sure be full when you leave this place. Very cute interior design as well, I love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Great spot for chocolate lovers. Very nice dessert options. The chocolate fondue is awesome. Good vibe."}
{"text":"Best hot chocolate! There was a point where I would come here bi monthly for a few months straight just to enjoy their hot chocolate. By now I've tried over most of em and they are all pretty good.   I'd give this place a 5 but their other food / dessert wasn't that great. I really didn't enjoy anything besides their hot chocolate.   Hot chocolate = 5 Everything else = 2.5"}
{"text":"It was my good friend's birthday and she wanted to come to Cacao to celebrate it!  I ordered the Choco-nut waffle which composed of a waffle, whipped cream candied hazelnuts, vanilla ice cream, melted milk chocolate, toffee bananas, and fresh strawberries (from their menu on their site). We also split a triple chocolate fondue (white, milk, and dark chocolate).  For their fondue, it came with a side of fruits, waffles, and brownies. The brownies fell apart when I dipped them into the fondue. The fruits were great though and perfectly complimentary with the chocolate.  For their Choco-nut waffle, I thought the waffle was going to be more fluffier but it was more dense on the inside. The ice cream was delicious- not overly sweet. The whole dessert was very, very sweet (coming from a sugar fanatic) and I would suggest you to split it with a friend if you don't think you can consume a whole plate of sugar.  Although the food wasn't spectacular, it was definitely a great experience and the staff were friendly and checked up on us. If I do return, I will definitely get something from their savoury menu."}
{"text":"C'est un endroit sympa pour travailler, discuter, je n'est pas goûté à tout leurs plat. Mais le chocolat goûte bon. La décoration est bien bonne, le service est en général bon, mais pas toujours."}
{"text":"Highly recommend for dates! My boyfriend and I had brunch here. The hangover omelette and the potato wedges are very good, but the best part of the meal was the chocolate fondue. It's smooth, and silky and not overly sweet. The meals are presented in such a cute way and the hot chocolates are huge! The cafe has an industrial loft kind of feel, with warm lighting and an incredible arousing aroma of chocolate. The staff are pretty chill and laid back.  There's wifi available on site. It's a nice place if you're craving something sweet breakfast as most of the menu are dessert type foods."}
{"text":"Ordered the large fondue to share for two. Not sure if it was just me and my boyfriend's large appetite but we ended up staying hungry after we finished. We're guessing it was from the selection of fruit such as pineapple. The chocolate itself is to die for. We finished it pretty quickly. It comes in a mini container that doesn't go all the way down and only ends mid way through, thinking you have a lot more chocolate. Other than that, it was a great setting and really enjoyed the food!"}
{"text":"Location: In the Village. The closest subway is Beaudry, and street parking is available (metered). That said, in the summer, Ste. Catherine becomes pedestrian-only so you're better off using transit and walking if you visit during the summer months.  The place: I ate on the terrace so didn't get a chance to see what it was like indoors. The terrace isn't huge but it does offer up a few tables. It's a great place to people-watch while you eat!  The goods: I stopped in for brunch and chose the vegetable frittata and a side of potatoes. The frittata consisted of eggs (obviously), spinach, onions, basil and feta. All of these goodies were oven-baked and served piping hot in a cast iron frying pan (perfect if you suddenly find yourself in need of a weapon).  When I saw the frittata, I really regretted ordering the side of potatoes - it was HUGE! Anyway, everything was great, fresh and hot. I should also mention that when you arrive, they bring you fresh fruit with melted chocolate. Yumm-O!  Service: Great. Our waitress was super friendly.  Price point:  The frittato + potatoes totaled around $15 + taxes and tip."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Been here on two separate occasions.  I won't want to come back.  Its very pricey for what they give you.  Ordered an apple crepe one time.   It was very dry and no flavour.  The apples were cooked very basic with some cinnamon and no sugar.  The crepe itself was extremely dry and flavourless made of what seemed like whole wheat flour.  Tiny bit of caramel sauce drizzled over it, and I mean a tiny bit.  I was thinking \"I paid how much for this?\"..  I could have made better at home.  Another time I ordered an omelette.  Again it was really basic with vegetables, no flavour.  The toast they gave with it was whole wheat, very stale.   It came with a fruit cup and chocolate sauce.  Again nothing special, stuff you can make yourself buy some fruit and melt some milk chocolate over it.  The chocolate was nothing special honestly.    Overall very disappointing quality of food for the price they charge it is not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great brunch. Chocolate dip with fruit is a nice touch."}
{"text":"3-3.5.  Good but nothing special I got the cafe au lait which normally is filtered coffee with milk but they made me a latte which is espresso.  It was good though!   I tried the bacon crepe.  It could have used more bacon!  The taste was good though. This isn't anything exciting about this place that I would recommend... but if you need a brunch spot with decent food, you can check this place our"}
{"text":"Breakfast time! My sister and I have a big day ahead... shopping day, therefore we need stuff ourselves with good breakfast.  It's a rustic looking restaurant. The service was friendly, nice and super quick.  I had white hot chocolate with marshmallows toppings and fruits/Nutella crepe. My drink and food were decadent. It was really delicious. My sister had a chocolate milkshake and grilled chicken/bacon waffle sandwich, which she gobbled like a maniac. She loved her dish.   The ambiance was cold. There were few people but it was missing warmth. Even though it was warmer outside for the month of January."}
{"text":"Can I say that I'm basically dead right now because of the bountiful chocolate that I've consumed from this place? Okay because that's pretty much what happened.  SO MUCH CHOCOLATE! My boyfriend and I ordered the Sweet Chocolate Experience for Two, and it came with waffles avec chocolate & vanilla ice cream with chocolate, as well as marshmallows, bananas, and strawberries to dip into a delicious pool of chocolate (fondue) and chocolate coated krispies. For two?? More like for FOUR!!! We may have been intoxicated by all this chocolatey goodness; we became very sleepy but happy with chocolate in our tummies.   So do I recommend this place? YES! If you're a lover of chocolate, go here! YUM YUM! Good pricing too."}
{"text":"There was a choice between the milk chocolate set or the dark chocolate set.  We went with the dark chocolate one.  This chocolate fondue set was characterized as \"A Little Bitter Chocolate Experience for Two\".  For $26.50, it included a dark chocolate classic waffle, fresh strawberries, bananas, chocolate-coated cereals, marshmallows for grilling, chocolate-covered ice cream, dark chocolate fondue for dipping, and a small dark hot chocolate for sharing.  It was also served with our own grill.  Despite the name showcasing the fondue set for two people to share, we found that it was doable to share between three people too.  It was adorable.  The grill was perfect for heating up the marshmallows to then dip the dark chocolate in to eat.  It was like eating s'mores without the graham crackers since the marshmallows were all fluffy and gooey from the heat.  It was so fun!  The signature dark chocolate was really rich and delicious.  The fresh strawberries and sliced bananas tasted good with the dark chocolate.  I also liked the chocolate-coated cereals although neither one of my friends cared for it too much.  I liked that the crunchy little spheres weren't too sweet but so chocolatey.   The dark chocolate classic waffle was really two pieces of dark chocolate waffles cut up and presented creatively on the dish and to make it look like there was more than just two pieces.  However, I liked that this was included with the fondue set for us to try!  I really liked the dark chocolate waffles too.  The waffles were just soft and warm enough for my liking.  The chocolate-covered ice cream was also good and went well with the waffle.  However, my companions again weren't a fan of the ice cream.   The small cup of hot chocolate was intensely rich and a classic \"dark chocolate\" drink."}
{"text":"If you're a chocoholic then Cacao 70 is your version of Heaven.  They have a wide variety of chocolate-related goodies on their menu and, in my opinion, absolutely give Juliet et Chocolat a run for their money. That being said, I don't particularly care for J&C as there's nothing extraordinary about them and I've found their desserts to be somewhat lacking in chocolatey goodness.   Anyway, the first thing to note about C-70 is that there always seem to be a line-up so be prepared to wait. I stopped in on a Saturday night around 10pm and waited about 30 minutes for a table.   As I looked around, I realized that everyone had gigantic portions of whatever it was they were eating (C-70 is definitely not cheap on portion size!) so when the waitress came over, I told her I wanted something relatively light and you know, not the size of a soccer ball. I ended up ordering the Raspberry Brownie Parfait.... which was huge! It was made up of real raspberries, whipped cream, chocolate brownie, melted chocolate AND chocolate sauce. AND ice cream. Holy Jesus, that's a heart attack in a glass, just waiting to happen. I did opt out of the ice cream part of the show but regardless, this dessert was VERY rich, although be it delicious. I was only able to eat half because my body just couldn't handle so much chocolate overload in one sitting.   I had also ordered a latté.... not realizing that they were going to make it with chocolate milk (using real melted chocolate). SO, I got a double dose of chocolate insanity and I didn't sleep all night.   Definitely worth a trip, though I suggest sharing something or going on an empty stomach. Mmmm.... choc'late."}
{"text":"Gave this place only 2 stars because even though I asked to have strawberries added to the crepe and I even stated that I would pay the difference, they were not added. The reason given by our very friendly waitress was because they were too busy and couldn't take the time to add on strawberries! I have never encountered such lack of accommodation for an order. We were willing to wait and were in no hurry but apparently the kitchen staff were!???"}
{"text":"As a chocolate connoisseur, Cacao70 has made it into my top 5 places to go for a delicious and dangerous (in a good way) chocolaty treat. I'm not usually one to be out done by a dessert but that almost happened the night I wondered in here look for a sweet treat.   I ordered the quadruple chocolate parfait which consists of chocolate ice cream, chocolate brownie bites, melted chocolate, chocolate whipped cream and chocolate sauce. It looked small compared to my companion's chocolate waffle topped with ice cream, but it packed a major punch. Every bite was just amazing.   The restaurant it self was a nice size with a cafe vibe.  There's a display of different types of chocolates that you can buy by weight. They also have chocolate artisan candies on sale. I bought a small assortment for a friend and she loved them. This place is nice for small groups and kids. I'd recommend it as a cute place for a date night."}
{"text":"It opens at 10AM, and there was already a line up! This place is super cute with a wide selection of chocolate as well. I think I ate way too much chocolate during this trip! We ordered a pretty big brunch, the bananas, strawberries and pineapples comes with it as a little treat! How nice! oh and don't forget about the melted chocolate dip!And brunch is served! That was such a nice little treat from the restaurant! I didn't expect that.  My husband got the chicken egg sandwich. I got the egg, bacon, beans, bread, potatoes and sausages! They come in big big big portions!!! So make sure you go hungry!!  I love the atmosphere of this place. Super cute! I would love to come back here for dessert!"}
{"text":"Not a huge chocolate sweets fan, but this place knocked it out of the park. Everything on the menu sound amazing and the waffles with chocolate and ice cream was the best thing I've had in a while. The flavours are perfect not to sweet just right.  Advice go with a few people this way you can all share each other's dishes."}
{"text":"Spectacular desserts (the triple chocolate cake is to die for) and a wide range of delicious hot chocolate. Go there for the desserts only, not for the main courses."}
{"text":"I had a veggie fritata for brunch and it was sooo good. It was served with fresh fruits and melted chocolate which was also great. The tables are very small but the environment is comfortable. I will definately come back when i have extra money to spend"}
{"text":"A cozy place to go to when you have a sugar craving! It tends to get very crowded in the weekend evenings, so its preferable that you get there around 9pm to avoid the line up!  Everything on their menu is good... I mean how can we go wrong with chocolate!  One thing I suggest, avoid trying this limited time hot chocolate-earl grey drink, it wasn't that great.... see picture for reference. But any other thing on the menu is good!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! After-party waffles were great, hot coco was good, ice mint coco was equally delicious!  Service was a little slow but it's perfect for this environment which looks like a good local hangout."}
{"text":"Caution: chocolate overload! Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.   The portions are not small, so be careful when ordering. I wanted one of each, but settled for a mocha frappe. It was really good. And even a small one was a decent size. Prices are fair, you do get good quality chocolate in all the drinks and desserts. The service was a tad on the slower side, but they were lovely.   I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice brunch here with friends. I ordered a Europa pressed crepe sandwich-it was a little rich for my taste but still very good-and we shared some grilled marshmallows for dessert, which were delicious. I've roasted a lot of marshmallows at many campfires over the years but this was a new one for me! The wait time was reasonable for both as well. Our server was friendly and very helpful explaining the differences between the various types of chocolate. The final bill altogether was pricey but based on my experience I'd say it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The worst crapes ever I had, I order Nutella fruit crepe and it's come without the Nutella"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch with friend and thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the menu choices and am looking forward to going back. The service was great & friendly."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious there! The serving / presentation is always super cute! The only thing is, went there on a tuesday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, but the service was just okay... The waitress took our order quick and forgot about our drinks until the end of our meal when we reminded her."}
{"text":"I always come here to eat, but tonight was particularly stressful. We came here at 22:15 because we are both working late night shifts and are used to a late schedule. We usually never had problem coming here an hour or less before closing time... Tonight though, the second we got our seat, we were just told to leave before 45 minutes. Working in restauration service as well, never have I ever told this or was allowed to say this to a customer. It instantly makes you feel unwelcomed and it causes anxiety and pressure my whole meal. I came here to enjoy a good dessert and I'm used to a good service and that's why I choose this place. But tonight i felt pressured to finish my meal and leave, couldn't even enjoy my late night dessert. Anyway, the food was good as always but service was very unfriendly!"}
{"text":"Came here to try out a crepe and ended up having their chocolate stout. Really good food. It was light and perfect."}
{"text":"Ambience is okay but I thought $7 was a bit steep for a milk shake or frappe.  It was just a regular sized glass of frothy milk shake."}
{"text":"I came here Friday evening during the Christmas  market.. And let me just say all chocolate lovers need to come here! Now!  When we got inside we noticed a short line of people so we waited about maybe 15 mins for a table. Once seated, my bf and I were looking at the menu and decided on the sweet experience for two. It consists of milk chocolate fondue with strawberries, bananas, marshmellows, chocolate covered cereal(? Don't remember), a grill to roast your marshmallows, a side of waffles with vanilla ice cream and finally a small hot chocolate. That was about $26 something so prices are definitely on the higher side.  When we got our fondue set, the server forgot to bring us our utensils. So we were just staring at the food with our hungry eyes! Luckily, I waved down our original server and he brought us our utensils and plates.   The fondue set itself was amazing, the milk chocolate was rich and creamy! Just like how it's suppose to be. Same with the hot chocolate I was really impressed! Anyways, food was great, service was fine. I'll definitely be back because I wanna try their crêpes!"}
{"text":"Just so average. Add the decor, and the location, you get up to 3-stars. Add to this a hot date, then you're pushing into 4-star territory. And if you get a nightcap out of the deal, then it's worth a 5-star rating.   However, since I didn't go with a hot date, nor was I invited for a nightcap, the 2-star rating is related to the \"nothing special\" menu, while I've had better elsewhere. If the items weren't as expensive, the overall rating could have pushed closer to 3-stars."}
{"text":"I came here with friends after dinner on a Saturday night.  We were told the wait would be 30 minutes but were seated moments after we gave our name to the hostess.  I liked the ambiance - big tables spaciously organized throughout the restaurant, which made for a perfect casual after-dinner spot.  I ordered the Peanut Butter Chocolate fondue to share with a friend.  For the record, there was no sign of chocolate in the fondue so the name was deceiving.  I love PB so I didn't mind the rich flavour of PB but another customer expecting a mix might have been upset.  I previously ordered the same thing at the Distillery location and it was far better.  I remember it was served hot and was not very oily.  This time, the fondue was cold and was noticeably runny and oily.  It came with some sliced fruit and a cold waffle and brownie.  While everything tasted good, it felt underwhelming compared to my previous experience. I really love the concept of a casual pop in dessert place so hopefully this time just fell short of expectations."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while in the distillery, it looked so cute and all that chocolate? Who could pass it up! We had a play to attend after so we were in a bit of a rush, Im more a savoury crepe person, while my partner LOVES chocolate. So I got the spinach and feta grilled crepe (without egg) -there was also not many savoury options besides breakfast things- while my partner got a chocolate banana crepe.  Presentation was great, however my crepe was dry and bland, while my partner said his wasn't as good as the presentation.   Overall service was a bit slow, i expected more seeing the presentation. However it was very busy, would probably go again to try some of their chocolate drinks and maybe something to share, the decor was good also."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dessert to take to-go. Being a chocoholic, I found it very hard to decide on what to order because everything sounded appealing. The server was so helpful and strongly recommended the chocolate cake. I am SO glad he did. (Do NOT be deceived, this is not your average chocolate cake!) It came in a cup (maybe bc we ordered it to-go), and it took all our strength to wait till we got to our hotel to eat it. It was HEAVENLY! Layers of mousse, cake, dark chocolate syrup (that was CREAMY), and other things I couldn't quite identify. The texture came together and just melted in your mouth, though the distinct flavors truly spoke for itself. How can something taste so light and yet so rich?! I couldn't stop thinking about that dessert for the rest of the day. A bit steep on the wallet for a cup of cake ($11ish after tax), but boy, it was definitely worth it! Would not recommend sharing! Preserve your relationship and buy your own! ;)"}
{"text":"So chocolaty and so good. Their menu is pretty big. It's a great place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Just waited almost 20 minutes for cake take out, the restaurant was almost empty. The when I asked what was taking so long the waitress apologized and said she couldn't say anything to the kitchen because \"they won't listen to me\". Don't care how good it is, not worth $10. The \"Triple Chocolate Cake\" doesn't have much chocolate..."}
{"text":"Had the nutella crepe with nana and strawberries. Not enough nutella for our liking though. Strawberry cheesecake was a little too tart. Good, friendly service"}
{"text":"Excellent service, free samples, versatile menu,. I love this place.  They offer brunch, and lunch special crepes as well as tons of dessert options. I actually came in for lunch, not dessert with my bf and ordered the special crepe called Rosbif with roast beef, cheese, and mushrooms. Yum! Very delicious. It came with a salad and I wished I asked the waitress what the salad dressing was because it was so good. My bf ordered a waffle with semisweet chocolate sauce, and a salted crepe. His waffle was not too soft, not too hard....just the right texture. The semisweet chocolate tasted great, it melted in your mouth. That's when you know it's good quality chocolate.  Waitress was very attentive and I enjoyed the free American style hot chocolate sample. I will definitely come back again and try more of the desserts and drinks. (I noticed there was a chocolate soda!!)"}
{"text":"In a failed attempt to find a wine bar in Le Village, we ended up here for some dessert. Preferably anything chocolate. A kowinkidink? I think not!   We walked in with high hopes. The air was filled with buttery aroma from fresh-made crepes and the decadent smell of cacao beans. Ahhh...We knew we were going to be in for a treat...  Their menu showcased a myriad of dessert options such as crepes, parfaits, chocolate something pizzzas, cakes, and cookies, as well as an impressive list of hot chocolate drinks. It was a cold night and the sound of something hot and rich was music to my ears. I decided to go with the CIOCCOLATA CALDA (Italian-style hot chocoloate). The menu states it's \"one of the most amazing treats in the world!\" Well, I couldn't say no to that, can I? It was indeed very rich and decadent. Not your typical American hot chocolate, the liquid is very thick, almost pudding-like and not milky at all. I like it! Dark chocolate is my thing and this one was leaning towards that with a pleasant hint of bitterness. For about $9 CAD, although the portion is generous, I would also like to think they only use quality cacao beans. It was a lovely treat!  I wish I could say the same for the crepe. We got the NUTELLA CREPE with bananas and strawberries. This took forever to come out but that's not exactly why I wasn't happy with this order. The crepe was huge! Filled abundantly with fresh fruit slices, I dug in and shoved the first bite in my mouth. Wow, that was underwhelming. Maybe I had too much sweetness from the hot chocolate already that my taste buds could no longer appreciate the subtleness of this crepe? Maybe... The strawberries were sour so that didn't help my cause either. The crepe, I almost couldn't taste it. I wish I ordered it a la mode but that was such an after-thought. I would've ordered a savory crepe if I didn't want anything sweet. It goes without saying, I've had better!    Skip the crepes when you come here and indulge yourself with a hot chocolate instead. WiFi is free, YAY! However, service was slow and they weren't even busy. Hmmm... This place is alright!"}
{"text":"Ce resto est toujours un incontournable quand j'ai envie de manger vraiment trop de chocolat. Je suis un peu triste qu'ils aient retiré leur pizza dessert Nutella et ricotta mais bon, ils ont d'autres choix qui sont tout aussi bons! Leur crêpes salées pour ceux qui feel qui salé que sucré sont délicieuses!"}
{"text":"Crepes?  More like Craps.   Bland, boring, uninspired.  Both our ham and apple crepes were dry and without any semblance of flavor.   Extremely disappointing.   2 stars only because service with nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Their chocolate desserts are pretty good but pricey for what you get.    Small Fondue with dark chocolate (4): Chocolate was really good.  Dipping items were good as well.  The chocolate is presented is a really nice bowl however its deceiving.  It's really just a small dish of chocolate.  not much at all.  We had tons of toppings left over without chocolate.  It was still good, just wish they didn't skimp so much on the chocolate."}
{"text":"Really cool chocolatey place, I prefer over similar places in Montreal so if you want to have a pure chocolate delight you should definitely give it a try.  Alternatively there are salty crepes for brunch :-) but why bother"}
{"text":"This was delicious! Our server was friendly and the service was fast. The food was absolutely delicious and I wish I could go back! The menu is mostly sweet breakfast items, but there were some savory crepes and sandwiches too."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! The menu has so many incredible creations that will blow your mind making it near impossible to choose!  I ordered the Grilled Marshmallows. They light this flame and you literally grill your marshmallows to perfection and use the items on the platter to make the most incredible smores ever!  Other people in our party got the Feel Like Chocolate experience and it was mind blowing! A little bit of everything!  Definitely needed to go for a long walk after this to work it off!  Highly recommended to any chocolate and sweet lover! Will be returning!"}
{"text":"My little heaven... chocolate, berries, and coffee... it was delicious! They have an incredible variety of deserts and hot cocoa. The menu was clearly organized to help me sort out exactly what I was craving. Being in the distillery district definitely gives it a plus."}
{"text":"Disappointment.  The place looks cool so the four of us wandered in at the end of a long day to get our dessert. The menu doesn't really have small desserts (at least not for small prices). I got a classic chocolate fondue with dark chocolate - which was really too sweet for what dark chocolate should taste like, but it was the best thing on the table. too bad that there wasn't enough fondue  for all the pieces of fruit, brownie and waffle that came with it. There wasn't a candle to keep it warm so it got cold quickly when you dipped cold fruit into it.  My friends got hot chocolates (dark and semi sweet) which they say is not impressive and not as good as \"Juliet et Chocolate\" (where I would recommend you visit instead). They also shared a triple chocolate cake that was served in an uncomfortable brandy glass with lots of whipped cream, but it didn't look good - nor did they like it - it was left mostly uneaten. Another friend had a parfait which he claimed to be like a milkshake and different from what he expected by the menu description and picture.  In short - if you want a big sweet mediocre chocolate meal - you can get it here, but don't expect much (except for a slight nausea  feeling). Across the street, at Premier Moisson  you will find better desserts for a smaller price. If it's a chocolate meal you really want you'll do better at Juliet et Chocolate (much better value).  We will not be back.  Oh - service was fine - therefore they get two stars."}
{"text":"We enjoyed an impromptu breakfast at Cacao 70 when Ma'Tine was unexpectedly closed.  We sat outside on the deck under the soft, magenta bulbs strung over the street. It was a warm, but pleasant summer morning.  The menu of Cacao 70 was extensive. There was a regular menu, a dessert menu, and a hot chocolate menu! M was deviant and ordered something that had nothing chocolate: coffee and a Europa crepe. She didn't like it. She thought that there was too much ham on the crepe. Even the server asked if there was something wrong with the food and if M would prefer something else.  I made up for that. I got two different kinds of hot chocolate: the darkest called the Equator and the lightest the French Cream. I also got the Illegal Chocolate Waffle and a side of bacon. Everything was on pointe. M kept eating and drinking all of my food and beverages also!  The Equator and the French Cream were huge contrasts to one another. One was mature, rich, and seductive. The French Cream was indulgently sweet and creamy.  My Illegal Chocolate Waffle was served with caramelized bananas, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce. I love caramelized bananas. It was a well put-together dish. I am thankful that I had some crispy bacon to cut through some of the sugar though."}
{"text":"Everything here has something infused with chocolate. Which automatically would get five stars. But I had wanted to buy some of the chocolate discs and upon finding out they do sell it, it was $12 for 100 grams (a handful), that is way too expensive when I can get Valhrona or Callebaut for cheaper.  Good things to get here are their drinking chocolates and crepes drizzled in chocolate."}
{"text":"I stopped in over the weekend and with the unseasonably warm weather we had, I decided to indulge in an iced coffee and a dark chocolate crepe. Although the crepe was thin, the unctuous dark chocolate sauce made it more than enough for a light meal. The combination with the unsweetened cold coffee was perfect and it left me wondering what the other menu items would be like... I'm sure I'll be back in the future."}
{"text":"If you want to know what real chocolate tastes like, this is the place to be. I had the Venezuela dark chocolate drink, which was to die for. The fruit and nut waffle was so amazing my dad finished it all and he doesn't like deserts much. The only warning would be not to over order because some of the chocolates are so rich it's easy to go overboard.   The place itself is trendy, modern, well decorated and bright. It doesn't try and fail to be fancy like so many places today, it is cool without even trying. The staff was nice, responsive and offered great recommendations.  In other words, you've got to try it if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wifey and hubby visited this chocolate heaven sans porkiebun for the sole reason that this place was open later than other dessert places in the area.  Nothing too spectacular about this joint. If you've tried good chocolate elsewhere then there's nothing too special about this place.  Hubby got a Nutella crepe with bananas. Server came back with strawberries in it but were quick to apologize. That's of course, after the little while it takes to get their attention. Crepe was mediocre. Wifey ordered the chocolate and peanut butter fondue, which comes with assorted fruits, brownies and waffles. Again, the desserts were not bad but nothing stood out either. Portion size were small compared to other dessert places out there.  Will visit again maybe with a bigger group to check out other menu items like the dessert pizzas."}
{"text":"This is another fantastic date spot or great for gf hang outs. After all, who doesn't like chocolate?  When I first came, I wanted to try all the different dessert. They have fondue, pizza dessert (made with chocolate of course!), waffles and pancakes. And there is always ice cream. They also have savoury menu that's for breakfast or brunch though I never had a chance to try these...interesting observation...if your chocolate fondue comes with marshmallow, they apparently give you a small roasting desktop stove to roast the marshmallows on before you dip it into the fondue...i really regret not ordering that after eyeing other tables!  There is hot chocolate  (with various intensity and flavour) and milk shakes (thick and creamy...)   I think the chocolate shots might be their claim to fame just because they devoted a separate menu to it.  They list the chocolates with the percentage of purity and the description sounds like a wine list with words like \"top notes\" and \"fruit bouquet\" and the region of harvest. You can request to sample a few of the chocolate pellets before deciding on what to order.   The shots come in a wine glass with the pure chocolate at the bottom and a small jug of warm milk chocolate that you pour into the glasses to drink. The chocolates are so rich that one shot is probably all you need for the entire day.   I will come back over and over again until I am satisfied that I've tried every single item on their menu."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a diabetic coma to fall in to, you have come to the right place! The smell of chocolate permeates the air of this crowded cafe. They somehow have managed to cram a large number of tables into their square footage while maintaining the navigability of the space.  With a menu so overwhelmingly large, it's a good thing the the staff is friendly and helpful and can help you navigate the sea of sweet that comprises their offerings.   In addition to chocolate and sweets, they also have a selection of savory menu items, such as crepes and paninis. I ordered the breakfast crepe with spinach, feta, and egg. The spinach they used was fresh baby spinach and I was surprise to see the egg did not come inside my crepe but in the format of two perfect sunny side up eggs next to my crepe. As it turned out, I loved it that way! I got to dip my crepe into the runny egg yokes as one would points of toast. My only complaint was that Cacao 70 does not offer be channel sauce with their crepes, and so, the crepe was a bit dry.  All in all, a great place to go as long as you don't mind leaving with a bit of a sweets induced tummy ache!"}
{"text":"Went by at 10:20 PM (40 minutes before closing time) to grab a quick bite. The two employees were there, doing nothing. There were no other clients. I was told they couldn't serve me for \"kitchen reasons\". I sais I could eat in under 10 minutes (what I wanted was pre-cooked and ready to serve!) and they insisted that they didn't have time before their closing time and was told more insistently to leave. Very poor work ethoc, was very disappointed l."}
{"text":"We checked this place out. It just opened so inside was all clean and squeaky-new like the wrapper was just taken off. They didn't have any soap in the bathroom, though...  I got the s'mores dish with the open flame to roast them. The flame roaster thing was really strong and I was scared that my hair would ignite. It died down pretty fast though and my last marshmallow was left uncooked and raw. There was barely anything on that dish. A couple grocery store marshmallows, part of a banana sliced up, graham crackers from the box, dribble of chocolate, thin liquid peanut butter, squirt of whip cream from the can - it was totally a DIY kind of dish. Like I could put that together for under $5 from the No Frills grocery store. They charge $13.50 for that.   But I get it, it is a chain and they have their set menu that is at all the locations. The only thing close to gourmet is the chocolate itself I guess. The s'mores dish was totally nothing special other than the interactive experience of cooking the marshmallow yourself.  I'm giving this place 3 stars because it was clean and bright (maybe too much bright/light), and a nice atmosphere and lots of options on the menu. It's a nice place to come with friends to hang out."}
{"text":"If you're looking for refuge from the cold/snow, this is an excellent place to come to. I came here during the Christmas market on a Thursday evening so the place was packed. I was with a group of 10 and we waited for about 20-30 minutes to be seated.   We all opted for hot chocolate. Prices for these drinks range from $5-10. I personally prefer to eat ice cream or some other form of solid food, but we were all pretty full from dinner. I got the frozen hot chocolate, which was pretty average, maybe a little too sweet.   Overall, it's good given the area, but it's not the best hot chocolate I've ever had. I would still come back to try their other desserts if I had the chance."}
{"text":"I had the nutella raspberry crepe and it was one of the best thin crepes i ever had, in terms of texture and taste! The staff is extremely friendly. The atmosphere is so cute ( perfect to bring ur date guys!). I went with my girlfriends and we absolutely loved it!   ++ very affordable for the quality AND quantity served!!"}
{"text":"Un envie de sucré ?! Voilà ce qui nous a principalement attiré. Un choix varié passant par une gamme de chocolat. Nous avons penché pour le gâteau au fromage qui est délicieux ! Le service est rapide et c'est dans une ambiance casual."}
{"text":"Ended up in this restaurant after ditching L'Avenue because of their long line. What a mistake that was. It looks very promising from the outside and when you sit down, but everything goes downhill from there. Service was atrocious. They took approximately over 45 minutes preparing our food when the restaurant was empty. The server took forever to take our order and was never around when we needed anything. Usually when i wait this long, I always think the food is going to compensate for the wait, but no, food was actually horrible. Four of the five plates we ordered were cold. I ordered the Meat Lovers Omelette. The omelette was dry and flavorless even with all the meats. :/ Two other people in our table ordered the Lazy Breakfast and it looked doleful. It barely had any eggs and it didn't look appetizing. Needless to say they weren't please with their food. Overpriced food, very long wait time and bad service. No thank you!"}
{"text":"Bad service.....when we came in the Resto...not busy....but we waited too long for order...the waiter looks like very busy.....he don't know how to do the job....we asked him to take the order..he ask us to wait for two mins.....and he is training with another new waitress.....and when the other customer coming ...he let the people waited too long......just don't give the seat to them.....so stupid waiter......the food here is not that good like everybody talking about....just soso....and expensive....."}
{"text":"Came here cause I was craving fondue and this place 100% satisfied that craving. I got the classic fondue and shared it with my friend and the portion was just perfect enough to satisfy our sweet tooth craving. The decor is cute - reminds me of a library cafe and the lighting is nice and bright in the front. The service is friendly but it was a bit awkward at first because no one greeted us at the entrance so we just sat ourselves down and grabbed our own menus - not a big deal. Overall, will definitely come back and try another dessert in the future."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 5/5 Variety: 5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Taste: 5/5 Price: $$ - $$$  The staff that served us was really nice! To make room for dessert my friend and I decided to share a Grilled Tuscan Chicken Sandwich (I forget what it was called on the menu, but it sure tasted like it)? I was blown away by the taste!  I love how you can choose your chocolates (and therefore their sweetness level). I love eating desserts, but I don't like mine too sweet so it's really hard for me to go dessert hunting. Since most places I've been to just taste like sugar. Anyway, I got a mix of white and semi-sweet chocolate fondue with my dessert and the taste was just perfect! It was sweet enough to be a dessert, but not too sweet that you can no longer taste what goes with it or over power the ingredients - fruits, brownie, and waffle in my case."}
{"text":"I do love chocolates: Ghirardelli, Lindt, Dove, Godiva, Laura Secord, Milka, and Cadbury are my favs. These brands are what I was comparing the chocolates at Cacao 70 with. Now I know there will be loyal customers disagreeing with me, and that's totally ok; but for those Yelpers who have the same tastes as I do, I have to share my insight.  Hubby and I shared the Volcano (brownie with coconut and sliced almonds, vanilla ice cream with whipped cream topped with sliced strawberries and chocolate and berry sauce drizzle). We tasted each component separately before combining them; everything tasted like it was bought from the grocery store and was over the top sweet.  I also ordered the Giuseppe Lama's Bolognese Hot Chocolate circa 1660 (orange flavored chocolate spiced with cinnamon). It was very thick and even after adding a whole cup of steamed milk, I still couldn't drink it. The different flavors just didn't harmonize well. They should really offer this in a shot glass as a sipping chocolate not a drinking chocolate.  Lastly, I asked for samples of their milk chocolate. The server asked if I wanted to sample it melted, hot or as a button; I chose the button chocolate. He came back with samples from Venezuela and Guayaquil. Hubby and I made sure to cleanse our palates with water between each tasting so we could distinguish the different flavors; we didn't care much for either one. We drank the entire bottle of water just to wash down the thick sweetness of the chocolates we tried.   The decor was nice, there's free Wifi, they're open late and I do have to say that our server was sweet, attentive, and accommodating."}
{"text":"Though the brunch and coffee were good, the service was not. The man at the cashier was rude when we asked to wait for the tables by the window. We stated we were willing to wait and he looked annoyed and upset. The entire time we were there he served us with an unwelcoming expression. Service was slow and it took long to simply get the orders in. Not a great experience."}
{"text":"I had the \"The Breakfast\" crepe and my wife had the \"Feel Good About Yourself\" crepe.  They were both excellent and authentic.  The hot chocolate was to die for.  I would recommend the Bolognese hot chocolate which had the faintest orange twist that was awesome.  We wanted to taste the chocolate fondue, but we were afraid that we might end up in a food coma.    We were able to get a table within about 10 minutes on a Saturday morning around 11:30 am.  Service was OK for how crowded the place was."}
{"text":"Great place for dessert or a very sweet brunch! We ordered the 3 chocolate fondue (I dont remember the exact name ), it was sooooo good. It came with fruits, waffle bits and brownie bits. The decor of the place is really classy and the service is good. I would give it 5 stars but i found the price a bit on the high side. For drinks we got their chocolate milkshake which one to die for!  I would definitely come back !"}
{"text":"Went there in 2016, the environment was really good! I love the huge bookshelf there! The service was nice too and the desert we had was quite tasty!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon. It was very busy. However staff was still fast with their service and friendly. We ordered the milk chocolate sharing platter for around $26 which included marshmallows for roasting, strawberries, bananas, hot chocolate and chocolate for dipping. As well as waffles and ice cream. It was worth every cent. Very good selection, a lot of fun roasting our marshmallows. Everything was delicious and we could taste the quality in the chocolate. My favourite was the hot chicolate. Thick, rich, not overly sweet but smooth chocolate. It was delicious. We look forward to going back to try other items"}
{"text":"Came for a quick brunch before going sight seeing, but they punched our meal ticket before anything was made so we never ended up getting any chocolate. One person ordered a parfait which they said was good. I don't know if I would come back here though, they don't have an alcohol license but have alcohol offered on the menu. Overall it was disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The menu here was so hard to pick from! I got the black and white waffles since the bf is a waffle person so we could share. The chocolate quality was great - SO yummy. The crunchy ball toppings were also tasty. The waffle itself was very good - the perfect amount of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Put it all together with the cold ice cream and we got ourselves a perfect dessert!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place with wonderfully rich chocolate.  But it is a far cry from there Ste. Catherine Street store in Montreal.  But I do return regularly for the hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Came into cacao right before the rush. the place was packed with only two servers, surprisingly the service was pretty fast! first time at cacao and definitely a great place with your significant other for a date. Ordered the banana pizza and the classic fondue. Both tasted amazing, definitely recommend getting the fondue! Highly reminded."}
{"text":"Located in the beautiful Distillery quarters of Toronto this fun local dessert spot is not to be missed. Awesome place to come for a night cap. Chocolate fondue, smores, hot chocolate and cakes galore. This place is a sweet lovers haven! I thought their pricing was fair considering it's located in one of the tourist hot spots. Service is quick. Can't comment on the parking since I took a cab here but if you need to take a cab back home there is a line up of them adjacent to the main entrance of the Distillery."}
{"text":"It seems that the folks here in Montreal love their chocolate. We were overwhelmed with the choices on the \"sweets\" menu, but finally decided that you can't go wrong with chocolate fondue. The \"single\" Flaming Turtle  was plenty for the two of us and  included banana, strawberry,  pineapple,  waffles and brownie bites. The chocolate was a perfect consistency and the right amount for the items to dip. You could taste the mixed in rum sauce at the back of your throat....in a good way.   We also ordered a spicy hot chocolate with curry and pepper. I would have liked it to be spicier and a bit hotter in temperature, but it was still delicious.   Other sections of the menu feature milkshakes, sundaes, chocolate for the purist, s'more's, crepes and waffles and on and on and on.   It was slamming here on a Sunday night, but servers were friendly and unflustered. Seems like it would be a good choice for date night!"}
{"text":"I ordered a milk chocolate mocha and the Chico nut waffle! Mocha was good, nothing extraordinary. Waffle was okay, mines were a little under cooked as the insides were too gooey.  They had one server working when we went (1-2pm), we weren't  greeted when we came in. The server also didn't come and take our orders until she saw that we were getting up to tell the front desk the order."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food +1 for the service. Its not exactly worth what you're paying for but they do have a nice food presentation and its very interactive. Good for pictures and groups of friends"}
{"text":"Would only recommend the earl grey fondue and nothing else. Overcharging for things that aren't impressive enough to wow my taste buds. Very basic flavours, nothing out of the ordinary (for regular food). Only get their desserts"}
{"text":"Got the single dark chocolate fondue (with fruit, brownie, waffle). It didn't seem worth $9.50... Until I realized there was a full CUP of rich chocolate. By the end I couldn't finish it and reluctantly had to share. A bit of a girly vibe, but the servers were helpful and friendly to our group ofbdudes. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I went here expecting killer waffles.  The result were small, floppy and thinner than expected.  We took the platter for 2 which included a small flaming volacano to roast marshmallows, some strawberries and bananas to dip in milk chocolate.  I would have licked the plate if I didn't look like a fool.  I'll be back to try the other plates because nothing is better than chocolate.  It's slightly on the pricey side."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location but I have previously tried Cacao at distillery district. Overall the atmosphere here is very relaxing and makes you wanna stay beyond the desserts to catch up with a friend.   We ordered the green tea foundue and the strawberry cheesecake crepe! Both was actually really good! The green tea fondue was like eating a green tea kitkat! The fruits were fresh and sweet! Overall a great dessert place!"}
{"text":"I love sweets so much. In fact, I could probably eat dessert for all three meals (so I thought.) I found this place via Instagram and the photos made my mouth water so I had to check it out. After checking out their site, I found out that there are a number of locations in eastern Ontario and Montreal.  On a Sunday afternoon, it was quite busy. We were lucky to have to wait only a few minutes as there was a table for two available right away. It's a nice shop that's open concept. You can see the staff prepare your chocolate treats. The windows are glass from the floor to the ceiling so you have the perfect view of the Distillery.  The menu is practically all sweets. They do have some savoury breakfast items though. My friend ordered the waffle with strawberries smothered in whipped cream. She let me have a few bites and I was a little underwhelmed. It was just too sweet and the taste of the waffle was overpowered by the whipped cream. I had the peanut butter and chocolate fondue for one. For one, it was a little too much. The portion could be smaller. I managed to surprise myself and did not finish it.  I love the concept of everything sweet on the menu, but a meal portion of sweets was a-ok. I would suggest ordering one thing and sharing.  Good for: sweets"}
{"text":"it should be a 3.5. but soooo much better than juliette and chocolat.  Fondue: gives you the option of one, two or three chocolates for the same price. The fondues are served with seasonal fruits, brownie and waffle bites. The portioni s large enough to share with two. the sharing sharing is a large portion that in my opinion can be shared with three people. Same at the fondue but is served with more stuff like a half nutella pizza. The pizzas are not good. The dough to topping ratio is not proportional and the dough is very dry making it hard to swallow.  The caramelized banana waffle is very good. It's simple. waffle, with caramelized bananas and chocolate drizzled on top. The surgar on top of the bananas are torched making it chewy and adding a different texture to the plate. Satisfies a waffle craving for sure. The hot chocolate is not good, its too thick for it to be a hot chocolate and too watery for it to be a ganache and flavor is off.  A very good date place and dessert for friends and lovers. I would recommend it"}
{"text":"Ok so in short, this place sucks.    Service: This place has the worst service I have ever encountered. The host and servers seem like they're forced to work at this restaurant. I hope the owner/manager reads this and has some serious training for the staff. The host basically discouraged us (8 people) from sitting down and eating, and told us up front that they had many limited dishes and that our plates would come out at different times. We had initially intended to go to L'Avenue but the line was out the door and it was -20 outside so NOPE. After being seated we order coffee and the server brings everyone their coffee in a mug but mine which was brought out in a paper cup. She said \"we do not have any more mugs\" when 5 minutes later I witnessed the table next to me with a mug. There was never a smile cracked by the server which is cool everyone could be having a bad day, but it seemed as if she was upset that she was even working. Every answer was short and dry. The coffees came with one sugar packet and when we asked for more the server was annoyed. They didn't bring out sufficient water cups so we had to ask the server 4 times for that as well. When clearing the table, the server looked at me annoyed almost as if she wanted me to help her clean. DO NOT GO HERE.       Side note: couple next to me left without eating because one of them received their meals and the other didn't have anything in front of them for 30 mins  Food: The feel-good omelet was alright; the bacon was super undercooked and the eggs lacked flavor. I wouldn't say the food was that bad but it also wasn't anything that I would come back for if everything else was good.     Ambience was just about the only thing that was cool. It had a nice Café vibe to it, and the décor and artwork inside is cool"}
{"text":"We ordered the cheesecake and it was a little disappointing.  The Volcano was great good amount of chocolate wish there was more strawberries.  The girl with the tattoos had a horrible attitude not friendly or helpful with the menu.  Please hire people who actually want to be there."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I was pleasantly surprised.The reviews are great but I throughly enjoyed my experience here.  The food quality/taste, ambiance and service were are great.So I went here on a cold mid afternoon.The place was 80 percent full.I like busy restaurant/eateries it makes my dinning experience better.  So this isn't a self seat restaurant you walk in wait to be seated and a server is appointed.We ordered an early grey tea, a macchiato and a classic half fondue.  The macchiato was great.The desert was so beautiful and nicely presented. The fondue was $11.75 I added strawberries for an up charge. All the fruits,waffle,and brownie were very fresh and flavorful and so was the chocolate.  Our service is was great, the server was quick and helpful.The ambience of the place is very warm and cozy with plenty of seating in front and behind.  The pricing wasn't bad either for all of what I ordered I paid $20 and some change.Their menu is so extensive, they got crepes and s'mores and so much more.They also have savory foods.   I'm definitely coming back here again to try their other desserts!!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite dessert place in Toronto! I seriously crave it! They're about to open a location in Scarborough town centre and I couldn't be more excited. Honestly, I can't even specify what I enjoy the most because everything on the menu is delicious. The chocolate sauce that comes with most of the dishes is yum. Chocolate explosion."}
{"text":"Cacao 70 is one of those must-go-to places for a romantic evening. They have several locations across Canada including Quebec City, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. We went to the one in Toronto's Distillery District after exploring the Toronto Light Festival. The restaurant is known for it's chocolate, and of course on Valentine's week, Cacao 70 was definitely packed.  My friend ordered a Strawberry White Chocolate Shake, creamy with bits of white chocolate you can chew on. I've ordered a Vintage Hot Chocolate with semi sweet. I had to pour the milk myself, which was an interesting experience. As for the main event, we've shared their limited Valentine's Special, the White Chocolate Strawberry Pizza, which comes in quarter or half size pizza.  The dessert came in three parts, the strawberry pizza coated with white chocolate, the bananas with the white chocolate on the side, and a vanilla ice cream drizzled with dark chocolate."}
{"text":"I had a large dark Moka here. It ruined my day. It felt like I did two lines of bad coke. They must be adding extra caffeine. At least it felt like that to my body for a the next six hours.  The food looked great though."}
{"text":"I would strongly suggest that if you go to Cacao 70 you REALLY like chocolate. There is barely anything on this menu that isn't chocolate, chocolate infused, or extremely sweet. The good thing is that I really like chocolate.  The service is really slow here so I hope that you aren't in a rush. It took about 10 minutes to get my coffee (iced) and in the end I had to send it back because my husband watched the guy make it. He used his FINGER to stir the coffee. The waiter understood and brought me a a new coffee and obviously at no charge.   I was trying to find something relativity healthy to eat for my daughter to no avail. We ended up getting her just strawberries.  The food simply wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be based on the Urbanspoon ranking of \"10 Top in Montreal\", so maybe I went in with high expectations.  I would probably go back if I was having a chocolate fit."}
{"text":"If you love chocolate this is the place to go. Yelped this place after dinner to grab dessert and did not disappoint. Wasn't too busy when we got there and was seated fast. Don't get a drink on your own, I'll leave you with that warning. We couldn't even finish our drink. Also don't order a drink and a dessert by yourself, share everything! Prices are a bit high here depending what you order. We had the banana waffle and upgraded it to the cacao70 waffle. We also ordered a hot chocolate with milk chocolate. It was really good but after eating the waffle we were too full to drink the hot chocolate.  Would come back but only for sharing a dessert or just a drink. The decor is cute and never felt like it was too crowded. Service was fast and easy to get their attention. But definitely come here on a emptier stomach."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing dark hot chocolate here. Marshmallows were weak. But I stuck with the 5 stars because I can't wait to have this again !"}
{"text":"This place is utterly amazing, I traveled to Montreal for spring break (I know crazy right?), but it was absolutely wonderful! My best friend and I would go here every morning to order the illegal waffles, black and white waffles, the fondue, the best lazy breakfast ever and of course the Costa Rica 30+ chocolate drink. I wish there was something like this in the states. :("}
{"text":"We tried the hot chocolates, brownie sundae, and the strawberries and chocolate sauce and everything was delicious. The service was really slow even though it wasn't crowded and the decor is strange."}
{"text":"Yummy.    Location wise, more convenient than distillery district.  I've learned my lessons, no more hot chocolate from cacao (too think more like sauce consistency)  At this location I order:  1. Black and White waffle using C70 special soft waffle version My issue is the ice cream melted fast, if you order this, I recommend that you take both scopes of ice cream off the waffle.  Waffle portion size little bit small. especially since I paying extra, I should get a little more waffle.  Rate: 8.5/10  2. New York Frozen Hot chocolate Disappointment.  Second cup taste better.  The best one I had was Serendipity frozen chocolate in Las Vegas. Rate 3.5/10   Service: Great.  Location: better, more comfortable.  I been to all three location, Montreal, distillery district and now Queens' location"}
{"text":"Superb for chocolate fanatics. I made a mistake of ordering milkshakes with all those chocolates and sweets. Perhaps have it with tea next time.   Overall, I would recommend for experience.   $$$"}
{"text":"I had the special dark chocolate with hot chocolate. It was a fun and busy place. Probably the worst service we had in Toronto. The chocolate was good."}
{"text":"They have quite a bit of diff chocolate items to choose from. Drinks, food, etc. tried dark frozen hot chocolate, the Italian pudding like cocoa, and chocolate pizza.  Get ready to spend a bit though for dessert 1/2 pizza is about $14 and drinks are @ $9 so this can be an expensive dessert experience.   Items are rich so keep it simple as over indulgence is a given here.  And there is such a thing as too much chocolate."}
{"text":"I went back yesterday and I still give this place 5*! Honestly, unless you don't know how to order or you don't like chocolate or desserts, I don't understand how you can't love this place. For my full review, please visit: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2017/10/18/baby-its-cold-outside-and-i-need-some-cacao-70-hot-chocolate-and-fondue-to-warm-me-up/"}
{"text":"Came to this location with 10 other family members as it takes reservations and the other downtown location doesn't.  Well-known for its variety of chocolate, brunch items come served with some fruit and chocolate fondue. While the food was good, the service was terrible. It wasn't particularly busy but our water didn't get refilled unless we asked - and we rarely had the opportunity to ask as they didn't come to check on us often, not even when they delivered the food to our table. One guest even had to get up and get the salt and pepper.   Another guest ordered a mint-chocolate milkshake, but was only served a regular milkshake. She took one sip, and told the waiter as soon as she could. The \"wrong\" milkshake sat untouched, while the waiter brought the correct order.   They would bring 2-3 plates of food every 5-10 minutes. When there's 11 people, that ends up being a lot of time for the first person served to wait to eat (we wait until everyone has been served before we eat - common practice, no?). Everyone's food had come except one person who ordered the same thing as a couple others (not something really complicated). We quickly asked if hers was still coming and the waiter replied \"yes, its on its way!\". 15 minutes later, the waiter informs us that she never placed the order. 20 minutes after re-placing her order (35 minutes after the last person received their meal), my cousin finally gets her meal.   There was no excuse for this, as the place was not busy at all. Not only did she charge us for her mistake (forgetting to put the meal in after telling us that it was on the way), but she called my cousin rude for wanting to get the charge of the WRONG milkshake off the bill. Completely unbelievable. No one should pay for something they didn't order. Just terrible service."}
{"text":"Cozy place, but Don't come here unless you have 50 mins of time to wait for ur foods to be served."}
{"text":"A friend told me about a cafe that had chocolate in nearly every item on its menu - and it just so happened that I stumbled upon Cacao 70 and realized that this was the place that she was talking about! I had the American-style hot chocolate (a bit boring, I know, but I like my hot chocolate with marshmallows in it) and the white chocolate crêpe. Everything was perfection - the hot chocolate was rich but not over-powering with the white chocolate crêpe being a good balance. On a side note, I also like the fact that you can have lunch there as well - great if you need something to eat but want chocolate afterwards.   Cacao 70 has a great social ambiance - perfect for socializing with a group of friends and dates! I like how the cafe is spacious and has shelves lined with books - it gives it a very relaxing and chilled out environment.   My one complaint would be the service. Although the service was quite friendly, it took almost twenty minutes for my hot chocolate to arrive - it really shouldn't take more than five minutes just to make hot chocolate, especially when there weren't many people coming in at the time. Service was non-existent after the dishes and mugs were taken away. We ended up having to go to the front to get our bills.  Apart from the inattentive service, I am definitely down for coming back here. I think it's great that there is an all (almost all) chocolate cafe here in Toronto (and in a good location too) and I am looking forward to trying out their fondue and chocolate pizza in the future!"}
{"text":"This location seems to have opened with relatively little fanfare compared to the Distillery location. The place doesn't seem to very busy, not even for brunch in the brunch-crazy city of Toronto.  I went with a few friends for dessert on a Sunday night. Their dessert menu is extensive, but prices are rather high. A simple crepe with a bit of chocolate on the side is $9, while adding fruit makes it $11. I tried the banana crepe and the strawberry crepe. As their specialty is chocolate, the melted chocolate was very good. However, the crepe itself was far too thick.  Desserts priced like meals and questionable food quality, Cacao 70 seems to be suffering from a bit of an identity crisis. In the midst of summer is not really the optimal time for cozying up with a mug of premium hot chocolate, so they really need to offer a better quality and value for desserts."}
{"text":"Came here with friends to relax after a day of shopping.  Service was attentive, and food was yummy as usual (sometimes a bit too sweet, depending o what you get). I would come back, especially since the location is so convenient!"}
{"text":"I've gone to both locations in Ottawa, and since Juliette and Chocolat was full when I called, we decided to go here with a group of friends.   Felt cozier than the Ottawa locations, and more spacy. Service was pretty quick, and food was delicious as usual."}
{"text":"I avoid this place like the pest. Yes it does serve everything you can think of covered with chocolate and in whipped cream but nothing is of great quality. Cacao 70 is a great example of a place that puts quantity over quality.   Everything is overly sweet, they use already processed materials (think store bought marshmallow, whipped cream, store bought wafer cookies, pre-made pizza crust, etc).   The quantity of whipped cream they put on everything is alarming - I've once had a bowl of whipped cream as a component of my tasting plate...   If you want good chocolate, I would definitely suggest suite88 or Juliette et Chocolat where the the ingredients are of better quality and the portion size more reasonable."}
{"text":"Five stars not because their hot chocolate was amazing but because they had a great service. Our waiter was the only one working that night and he had to serve 5 other tables. He made sure our table had everything we needed and he even gave us a complimentary brownie with strawberries! Otherwise the setting is great for a group or just a date for coffee/dessert. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dessert spot! The coffee was great, and the waffle was dense and sweet, but light somehow. The atmosphere is lovely, and the smell of deliciously caramelized sugar is thick in the air. The lineup was quite long, but it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Overdue review - I was disappointed with our experience here. My husband ordered a sandwich that had bacon in it - asked for the bacon to be removed and to add smoked salmon. We were told there would be an additional charge and we agreed. We received the sandwich - with bacon inside. Mistakes/misunderstandings take place in the kitchen, no problem if handled well. Except that as I ate my vegetarian omelette, I found pieces of ham in that too! Two strikes within one meal."}
{"text":"Went back for a frittata on a Thursday lunch. Not very busy. Frittata was good and had a good mix of veggies. Nice hangout place."}
{"text":"Had the Earl Grey Chocolate fondue (small) for $13.50. It came with a piece of waffle, brownie, and two small bowls of chopped fruit (pineapples, bananas, a tiny bit of strawberries). It was enough to share for two people as a light dessert.  It was tasty - think very creamy Earl Grey (It's white chocolate based). Don't be fooled by the tall bowl - it's actually very shallow like a plate, about 1/2\" deep. It wasn't enough to dip all items but enough for the fruit and waffle.  The service was warm and efficient.  Overall, a nice place to have something sweet (or savoury - they had sandwich and savoury waffle options) and catch up over a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch options. The crêpes au sarrasins are pretty amazing. The staff is friendly. Good adresse!"}
{"text":"The only place with a table available Friday night at the distillery district and I'm glad the other restaurants were full. The food was great, the atmosphere relaxed, and the staff friendly.  My boyfriend and I split the chicken waffle sandwich and a small classic milk chocolate fondue.   The sandwich was so delicious we ended up ordering a second.  The waffles were sweeter and fluffier than others I've had which paired very well with the savory chicken.  The chocolate fondue was delicious, not too sweet or to bitter. They also gave enough fruit, waffle, and brownie bites for the amount of chocolate. That being said, if you are only there for fondue, order the large.   Overall I would definitely go again to try the test of the menu."}
{"text":"We came here around 7pm, it was pretty busy but still seats were available, since we got seated with in 2 minutes. However after we we're seated, we weren't given, menus no water and no cutlery. After waiting about 20 minutes and grabbing the menus our selves we had to call a server over for him to realize we haven't gotten anything yet. At this point he said give me a minute and brought over cutlery (which was dirty) and water and didn't apologize.  We we're pretty disappointed by now but good thing we waited for the food because if the service is like this often then the only thing saving this place are it's chefs since the crepe and salad that we got was delish!   I don't think I'd come here again unless I was in distillery district and nothing else was in the area."}
{"text":"I have had brunch here twice and have been impressed both times! Seems like many of the brunch meals come with a little side of fruit and melted chocolate. Delicious. Food is also pretty fast and tastes really good. Of course there is a huge list of chocolate items on the menu and they are great."}
{"text":"I came with my cousins for so chocolate goodness and was satisfied. I got the fondue. It came with fruit, brownies, and waffle bites. I enjoyed it a lot and got extra chocolate at the end. The crepe my cousin had was pretty good. The waffle was likewise good but too sweet with their milk chocolate."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to Cacao 70 for special brunch and we were greeted by a waitress there. The food was good but the service was not. We are both poor university students and we understand that the social norm for tipping is 15%, but when you barely have enough money to feed yourself, tipping isn't something that you'd have the luxury to do. We both tipped 10%. It's not as if we didn't tip. The waitress pointed out that we didn't tip the usual 15-20% and asked us if the service was poor. Of course we understand why she would ask, but her attitude made us very uncomfortable. We said that we weren't dissatisfied by the service, and then she proceeded to ask us why we didn't tip the regular 15-20%. Her manners were rude and hostile. Although the food was good, the service and this waitress's attitude ruined our whole meal. I'm not sure if I would return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Coffee is like any other coffee place, nothing special. I ordered triple chocolate cake and it was everything but chocolate.. probably a crep or waffle will be a better option."}
{"text":"Food is good, but might be a tad overpriced. Freidnly service.   I used to go Cacao 70 so many times when I was in Montreal. It was a big hit there, so they opened a new location in downtown while I was there (last year). So when I heard that Cacao 70 was coming to Toronto, I was super excited.  It was not the same as I remember from Montreal. Although the menu is the same, I feel like there are better dessert places at a more reasonable price in Toronto. I ordered strawberry shortcake ($11.95 before tax and tip), and it came in a glass. A glass full of shortcake cubes, fresh strawberries, their signature strawberry sauce, and whipped cream. I was disappointed. We also had a strawberry cheesecake crepe ($17.95) it was better than the shortcake, but remember we paid six dollars more for this.    Overall, I will not return to this place because I can get better crepes and cakes at a cheaper price in downtown or uptown. Their brunch menu is worth a try if they have the same quality as the one in Montreal ( they at least have a same brunch menu). I do not recommend their regular savory menu though (based on my experience at Montreal locations)."}
{"text":"My sister and I thoroughly enjoyed this place. We came here pretty late in the evening to have dessert, and the atmosphere was really nice and relaxing. We had Strawberry Nutella Crepes which were really delicious. The staff was helpful and very friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm so torn about this... I went in for a milkshake... and knew full well it wasn't going to be cheap but assumed my mind would be so blown away because of the quality of the chocolate here, there's no way it's not worth it. So here's the thing, it's worth it... like you compare it to a milkshake half it's price from elsewhere, and yes its double as good.... so the price makes sence. I'm just thinking that maybe milkshakes up in that price point shouldn't even bother to exist anyways, its just kind of unecessary to be that pricey for somthing as simple as a milkshake. I'll re evaluate this review after I go back again for somthing else. For now, 3."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal from New Brunswick and had heard great things about this place. My boyfriend and I wanted something sweet after dinner, so we decided to give it a try. When we entered, we were seated immediately despite seeing a full restaurant. Service was friendly and fast (though it took us a while to figure out what we were going to get!) Once we figured it out,  (we got the \"Feel like chocolate\" plate to share) we certainly had no regrets! The only regret is that we didn't  have more time to taste all the delicious chocolate dishes! We also got boozy milkshakes (the Brazilian, I believe) and it was amazing. Such a great experience and very delicious treats! Will definitely be back again next time I am in the city."}
{"text":"A great place for satisfying that sweet tooth. Simple decor that's cozy and warm makes you feel welcomed. I regularly go on the weekend for their lunch menu waffles. My favorite is the Illegal Chocolate waffles with banana slices and scrumptious melted chocolate all over it. Service can be a bit slow when they are busy so I tend to avoid the peak hours. They also have an extensive assortment for cocoa connoisseurs but I've only tried a few of them - too much chocolate for lunch!"}
{"text":"I wish i could leave less than one star. I couldn't tell if my sandwich was chicken or fish. I wasn't able to eat even half of it. So terrible. Worst meal of my life"}
{"text":"This was simply awesome.  A friend recommended it and when they offered the chocolate sample when I walked in to check out the menu, done deal.  Got the grilled chicken sandwich with fries.  Both were great, but the accompanying fruit with chocolate - awww hell yeah.  (Check out the pic I posted.)  Also appreciated they let me substitute eggs with bacon.  Friendly staff.  Was surprised to see this place so quiet while all the tourists flocked to the restaurants who had a patio because it was the first nice day in a week."}
{"text":"This was overhyped. I was expecting better, but it was still good. Probably wouldn't go again though."}
{"text":"I hate to be the first (I think) to write a bad review about this Montreal favourite - but unfortunately, my last visit there left me extremely disappointed.  I have been to this location a couple of times in the past but from last Friday evening's experience, I feel the quality and standards have fallen tremendously.  It didn't take us long to get a seat and were pleased when we were offered a lovely banquet. We ordered the 'Choco-Nut Waffle,' 'After Party Waffle' and a Banana Split to share. Immediately, just from the appearance of the waffle, we could see a difference.  The waffle was extremely soggy and as if it had been made the previous day. The strawberries were tasteless, the banana's still a little frozen. On the menu, the toppings were described to have 'fresh strawberries, toffee banana, hazelnuts etc' - we weren't given a choice of ice cream flavour and the fruits were definitely not fresh! All the space was just filled by tasteless whipped cream. The melted chocolate too was not good -  not Nutella or comparable to that of its competitors.   For the price and what was presented, we were all extremely disappointed and didn't even end up finishing, despite sharing. For a sweet-tooth like myself, that is saying something.  I will not be back any time soon"}
{"text":"I love their dessert selection, however I don't know if they were understaffed the service wasn't that great. We went on a late Friday night at around 9:30PM and the restaurant wasn't busy but for some reason it took them so long to serve us, they never refilled our water bottle, they forgot our coffees and they made us wait forever for the bill. We were only supposed to stay there for about an hour but we ended up staying til almost closing."}
{"text":"I was visiting from the U.S. And wanted to eat some breakfast before hitting up the shops on the same street. I browsed around the street and looked at many menus and cacao 70s looked the best so this was where we chose to eat.   The restaurant is very pretty and classy. They had the screen open so you could look at the beautiful street while you eat. We had a great view of the street. Our waitress was very nice and explained some of the dishes to us. Most importantly, the restaurant did not smell, especially not of fried food!   We chose to order two dishes- chocolate peanut butter fondue and white chocolate crepes. It was my first time ever eating fondue and it was beyond amazing. It was chocolate mixed with peanut butter and came with strawberries, bananas, pineapple and chopped brownies and waffles. The brownies and waffles were to die for. The white chocolate crepe was delicious but simple. I absolutely loved what we ordered.   The menu looked fantastic and had chocolate pizzas, waffles and hot chocolate I would love to go back and try someday.   One of the best things about the restaurant was it had free wifi with a great connection. we were grateful because we did not have access to our phones in Canada.   Cacao 70 will be one of my first stops next time I visit Montreal. I tried some other breakfast places and this was by far the best one. The prices were reasonable compared to everywhere else."}
{"text":"Update - I think the staff who I assumed I was lying was let go, I haven't seen her around in my past 3 visits. They are doing \"Take Away\" hot choclates now even if you don't sit. ------------------------------------ I am a regular at both cacao's location, end up going to either one at least once in 2 weeks. The quality is consistent in both locations, the kind of hot chocolates they make are really hard to find in other places and they have really interesting dessert menu.  That being said, i am rating this location low stars because of what happened last time I was there. I usually order one hot chocolate for dine in and one for take away and I have never had a problem, I went last Friday and asked for the same and my server said \"sorry sir, we don't do take aways for hot chocolates\", I told her you guys literally gave a hot chocolate take away last week, and two weeks before that, and she replied they don't do hot chocolate take aways here and she is not sure how i got it.  Dishonesty goes a long way folks, you could tell me that it is very busy today and we will bring you the cup and you do it yourself without lying to me and i will understand, but if you're going to flat out lie, or assume that i am lying, thats just not cool."}
{"text":"I realize that i may have been unfair to this place in my last review. What happened was terrible but the manager reached out to me and assured me that he has had a talk with his staff and would make sure this doesn't happen again.  He wasn't wrong, because i visited this place again at 10:30 after calling them and they did serve me without any hiccups. Their stuff is amazing and that is out of question, from the little knowledge I have, I think this is Toronto's attempt at Julliette and Chocolate.  I have been to this place thrice already and see myself going back again whenever I am craving their cheesecake crepe and hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Upon entry, I was seated immediately despite the restaurant seeming to scream \"no more, too many already\". And it was a good spot too, at the back with 3 chairs, even though it was for just me and one other. Place was like a sauna! Sweat gathered on my nose. Not complaining 'cause it was a snowy day (hopefully the last for this winter and note to those from warmer cities like me, there is snow here at the end of March sometimes).   Waitress was cheery. All smiles. I wasn't seated for even 5 minutes and she asked me what I'd like to drink while waiting for my friend. Just water was fine. And what was super great was that they gave a water jug and 2 glasses with the menus! Not many places do that apart from some Korean restaurants. Yay!   I ordered the banana split waffles and my friend took the choco-nut waffles. They were similar except that she had strawberries with her bananas and I had choco wafer balls with bananas, which were, in addition, caramelized. Oh! And hers had whipped cream (I was slightly jealous about that). All in all, a good meal at a good price ($14.5 + tax). I walked out thinking this place is a tad better than Juliette et Chocolat. Bigger portions and wider selection of desserts and non-sweet dishes."}
{"text":"I really like where this place is located. Its quite charming in its own way as far as the surrounding structures and you have to walk quite a bit inside because their not necessarily visible by the road side. Once you see the heart shape statue and keep walking pass that, this place would be in the left side.  I really recommend for you to come here if you love sweet/chocolate desserts. I had the Belgian Cocoa drink and it was delectable....I just couldn't finish it because it was REALLY rich, let alone thinking about eating something else from their menu was already too much for me to handle. Perhaps share this with someone?   My partner got the Black and white waffle dessert... it was really good. The vanilla ice cream on it was really nice but the chocolate ice cream was mediocre. The waffle is okay... depending on what type of waffle you generally prefer so the one we had was soft..not crispy if that makes sense.  Anyway, our server was really nice. The dude gets 10/10 for customer service. Very polite and likes to converse with you.  Overall, I recommend going here with your family, friends, or spouse. Depending on what time of day it is it can get busy so you might have to wait and they also do take outs."}
{"text":"A new dessert place added to Distillery district for some tasty sweet and sinful chocolate desserts. Their decor is very nice, it had an industrial feel but very well lit. Its a small space so if you're looking for a quite place to catch up with friends this might not be the best location for you. It can get quite loud and the table sizes were quite small so it will be difficult for them to handle groups larger than 6 people on a busy night.  Their dessert menu is really something else. They had a large variety of different chocolate available for you to sample, ranging from dark chocolate to white chocolate. Their prices were comparable to some other dessert places like Demtries or Symposium. I got their triple chocolate cake dessert and it was amazing! Different layers of chocolate butter cream, chocolate sauce and chocolate cake with whipped cream, how could this be bad?    My only complaint about the experience was the wait time. My group and I were 6 people in total and unfortunately had to wait over an hour to get a table. However this was during the Christmas Village event in distillery so this experience maybe a little bias. However the staff were quick to notice this and offered us some chocolate samples for our patience.   Overall, I had a good experience and the staff were friendly but if you need to wait over an hour for the desserts its not worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic option if you're around the Distillery District and especially after walking around the winter Christmas market. It's the perfect spot for a chocolate-holic or someone with a serious sweet tooth. Prices seem high, but their hot chocolates are massive and their fondues come with plenty of chocolate and piles of fruit. Portion sizes are on the bigger end, so I'd recommend sharing them with someone else if possible. The wait can be very long and service is somewhat spotty."}
{"text":"This chocolate café is great for anyone with a sweet tooth! So many options to choose from, and I got the hot chocolate with Tanzania chocolate (one of the darker choices). There's a menu for you to choose your chocolate from where they give the cacao content. The higher the percentage, the darker the chocolate. From the view in the booth, I could tell that this simple order was made very delicately by the cooks. The way they poured the chocolate into the round glass, to coating the rims with the chocolate you chose so you're able to taste your chocolate before the hot chocolate mixture hits your palette.  The plate came with a mug of regular hot chocolate and the special chocolate you chose in a glass. You can taste your chocolate first before pouring some of the hot chocolate in, drink it, then pour more hot chocolate in-- all while trying to drink it without marking your nose with chocolate! Mine tasted dark enough to my liking, but I couldn't even finish my drink because it was so much and I get pretty full from chocolate easily.   Open windows in the café, so you can peer at the outdoor seating area as well as the streets. Peaceful and chic ambiance, with great music (I was so excited to hear Carla Bruni) and the customer service provided by our waitress was great, and she was super helpful in explaining how to taste and drink our chocolate!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Poor customer service. Had a chocolate hazelnut pizza. Didn't like it. The dough tasted and looked undercooked. Hot chocolate drink was rich and tasted ok."}
{"text":"Three girls we tried their dark chocolate classic fondue. The fruit, waffle to dip into it were generous. Good quality chocolate too. Overall, we enjoyed our experience. If they improve the ambiance a little bit, that would be great, such as less lighting or make the place more cozy."}
{"text":"As much as I am a snob for Juliette & Chocolat, I have to say that this St. Cat's location of Cacao 70 does its job pretty well. Compared to the other location on Parc that is within closer proximity to the McGill campus and where I live in the Plateau, this Cacao 70 outdoes it on all fronts. The ambience in particular is much more classy and feels like it had more effort put into it - polished tables, wooden chairs, and a nice, airy layout - whereas Parc's feels much more clunky (plastic colored chairs?) and is only famous because it sponsored McGill Arts frosh last year, if I remember correctly.  Since I hadn't eaten a savory meal at all that day, I went ahead and ordered the spinach, tomato, and feta sandwich; it actually tasted quite nice despite the spinach being slightly watery, but perhaps it was because I was utterly famished at the moment haha. Then, I went ahead and ordered the dark chocolate fondue, which came with an assortment of fruits (pineapple, banana, and strawberries) as well as a brownie and waffle. The fondue complimented the fruits and waffle PERFECTLY without it being overly sweet; however, the brownie with the fondue itself was too saccharine for my liking, but it tasted divine on its own.  Although I still prefer Juliette & Chocolat over Cacao 70 overall, this location hits the spot for those chocolate cravings. Definitely go to both locations to compare and see which one fits your liking the best!"}
{"text":"Très déçue du service. Nous avons commandé une crêpe. La crêpe était froide, j'ai demandé au serveur si c'était normal. Le serveur me répond : bizarre, je vais voir c'est quoi que la cuisine peut faire... il revient 5 min plus tard et il me dit : je l'ai mis dans le micro-onde, veux-tu l'essayer? Encore pire que la crêpe froide et molle évidemment. Je refuse la crêpe. Il retourne à la cuisine et pendant ce temps on attends impatiemment... après 20 min, toujours pas de nouvelles.. on lui demande qu'est-ce qu'il se passe avec la crêpe? Il nous répond: ah j'ai annulé la commande étant donné que le chef ne voulait pas vous offrir une nouvelle crêpe !  Bravo au super service."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé ce jour une gaufre choco noisette, venant assez régulièrement je savais ce qu'il devait arriver dans mon assiette. Surprise ce jour l'assiette est arrivée, froide, les gaufres molles et pas assez cuite, la glace fondu, une montagne de crème chantilly pour camoufler le tout. J'ai demandé à me faire changer l'assiette, il m'a été dit que cela été impossible car j'avais goûté l'assiette pour couronner le tout la table que j'avais était bancable personne n'a souhaité la mettre à niveau !   Vraiment déçu, dernière fois que je viens"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. The portions were way bigger than I thought they would be! And I love how here's they come with fruits and the cute little chocolate fondues."}
{"text":"This is one of the best crepe places I've been to. The cappuccino is absolutely perfect. Not too strong not too weak. Creamy and smooth. Their crepes are always well cooked. Their service is great always quick. The staff is super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I visited yesterday with my friend, but this is a great place for a date! We ordered the \"Sharing Sharing for Two or More\", the American Hot Chocolate and I got the Cioccolata Calda. Everything was fantastic! The table side grill to roast marshmallows brought me back to my childhood and the bananas that were served with the waffles were unreal."}
{"text":"We ordered black and white fondue but we ended up with black and white fondue but our server whose gracious and kind brought us the fondue to make it up. Amazing combination! Green tea was nicely done to wash down the chocolate after finishing. Amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  So glad they are expanding now, such an amzing concept.  Chocoholics heaven.  The  chocolate is sooo rich so pace  yourself.  I know the menu is super hard to choose  what you  want, and everything looks so good but I would recommmend only  a few chocolately things in one sitting.   Great date place, with awkward  chocolate fondu mess- very sexy.   Recently had the nutella ricotta pizza, love how they pair some things you don't  normally have with chocolate.  I would love to see more unique twists and combinations, more spices etc.   Of course to really experience it you have to  get a Cacao;  so many to choose from and then  you make it just the way you like it with the  right chocolate type and  milk ratio.  Of course  most of the chocolate drinks are super duper rich  so you  will be spending quite a while here to enjoy them; perfect for a cold  rainy day.  I know alot of first timers feel weird asking for a to go cup to take their cacoa but it's totally normal."}
{"text":"Décevant. Le cadre est sympa et le service correcte, mais plusieurs déception pour ce restaurant spécialisé dans le chocolat... Voici notre collation : 2 gaufres C70 (à base de chocolat).  - 5.50$ Avec une sauce chocolat.                  - 1.50$ De la crème fouettée.                         - 1.00$ 2 chocolats chaud d'époque (dark).   -6,75$ Soit un total de 29,50$ et donc avec les taxes et le pourboire, 38,42$... Le prix aurait été correcte si la gaufre n'était pas arrivée blanche et que le chocolat ne s'était pas transformé en un mélange de grumeaux... Bien dommage, c'est un concept que j'aurai bien recommandé mais finalement le rapport qualité prix, n'est vraiment pas génial... Surtout que je suis un amateur de chocolat..."}
{"text":"Guys honestly cacao 70 is really overrated. I visited cacao 70 today with two of my friends and we were all fairly dissatisfied. I ordered a latte and my friends ordered the matcha hot chocolate and earl grey hot chocolate respectively. We also ordered a fruit crepe to share amongst the three of us.  Firstly, all three of our drinks were served lukewarm (not even warm). This was especially problematic because our drinks quickly became cold and unappetizing. My latte tasted especially bitter and there was just something off about it ... but the fact that it was served lukewarm made it even less appealing.   The crepe was served with three fruits (strawberries, bananas and raspberries). The strawberries were okay, but the raspberries tasted VERY sour and had a gross, mushy consistency. I think that the raspberries must've been served from a can or a jar because there's no way that fresh raspberries would be served like that.   The crepe itself was also super thin and crispy for some reason... and overall I'd say this crepe tasted like something my 6-year-old nephew would cook. It was dry, bitter, messy and disappointing. You know that there's a problem with a restaurant when you feel like you could've cooked something better at home.  I'd also like to mention that the sink in the washroom didn't have running water (very unsanitary in my opinion)...  TLDR: Lukewarm drinks, sloppy crepes. There are better cafes in this area -- if you have the option, don't go to cacao 70."}
{"text":"Great Desert Place. Creeps don't compare to the Waffles"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The hot chocolates are shareable and the brunch items are too."}
{"text":"I was the first customer in the restaurant, so it was quite peaceful. I ordered the banana split waffles; they were unreal! I fell into a caramelized dream full of bananas, vanilla ice cream, sugar crispies, milk chocolate ganache, and choco-pops. I felt like an umpa lumpa, minus the green hair and orange face, add a full round stomach. It's better than Gene Wilder's vision of Charle & the Chocolate Factory! I'll post a picture too, you should check it out! #WillyWanka #GoldenTicket"}
{"text":"It was pretty cramped when I went. Food was ok but the presentation was really nice. Service was decent too."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert, ended up staying an evening!  We came in early, hoping to avoid the type of line-ups these chocolate cafes tend to create and got lucky as we were seated immediately with the only table that was available. The menus were given to us, the water of glasses were poured and then we waited...and waited...and waited.... to simply place our order.  We ended up flagging her down about 25 minutes later and placed our order with authority. We didn't drive all the way here to be denied our yummies! I went with their dark Italian chocolate and we shared a chocolate fondue meal.   The hot chocolate was perrrrrrfect, with the right amount of bitterness that made it nostalgic for me! The fondue to share for 2 was huge! SO MUCH CHOCOLATE!!! We had a great time trying everything out. For the food I give it a solid 5 stars.  Did I mention we waited nearly 45 minutes for our food after we ordered? Yeah, we did. When it came to pay we simply rushed the counter to pay because we couldn't afford waiting any longer. The service was a 1 star for me, she was nice but she and the kitchen were completely overwhelmed with so many people... on a Saturday night?!? We shouldn't be here for 2 hours, heck at least ask us if we wanted anything else while we were sitting down!  If you're wondering why you're waiting 30+ minutes at the door (and when we left the line-up did stretch to outside), then this is the reason why!   Hire more staff Cacao 70!"}
{"text":"Great service...excellent food...delicious fondu...please bring tour franchise to Fort Lauderdale!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible, TERRIBLE. Its like they are actually paying us to go and have food there. This place is so crowded and loud, you can't have a proper conversation . I think it's a little bit overpriced too, the plates are well presented and everything but it's not wow. I went there twice and I think i'll end up going to juliette et chocolat instead, much much better."}
{"text":"The good news: The sandwich bread is delicious. The chocolate quality is, indeed,1st rate.  The bad news: They got 1 of our 2 orders wrong and an order at the table next to ours. My chicken salad was so full of mustard flavour that I could barely finish it though I was famished and too much of the mesclun was rusted. Yet, when my friend asked for mustard for her supposed beef crepe she was told they had none. To boot the crepe had a super thin single layer of beef and almost none of the advertised mushrooms or cheese besides being too sweet to be called savoury. Our mugs of hot chocolate were so huge that we could not have finished them in a million years and the orange flavour advertised was no where to be seen. Service was impossibly slow but they appear to be understaffed and what staff there is appeared under-trained.  Verdict: The bad outweighed the good too much for me to go back. There's better elsewhere."}
{"text":"FIVE STAR FOR THE FOOD: I went there for desserts, and Oh. My. God. Best dessert place ever! Had a Black & White chocolate fondue with an americano, shared a single with a friend after a meal, and we were full. Best chocolate ever--my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The only reason why I wouldn't give full five stars is because of the service. My friend and I wanted to sit and take plenty of time enjoy our coffee + fondue, but the server asked us whether we were done with our food when we hadn't even finished half of it! Even after that, she walked around our table which made us pretty uncomfortable...so we had to finish our food in a rush and leave."}
{"text":"Ordered the American hot chocolate, semi-sweet and it was very creamy and tasty.  Very nice to have a real hot chocolate somewhere, especially in cold canada!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of chocolate but the place really gives you the choice. You can have a cup of single origin hot chocolate and it's fantastic. Deserts are amazing, waffles and crepes but too much of a chocolate at the same time. If u come to try every bit of something each time you come it's definitely worth it. Nice location  and place is very coz inside. As you can read I do not have a sweet tooth but for a chocoholic it's a place to go."}
{"text":"I could have died happy after eating at Cacao 70! This was the perfect establishment to get my crepe fix when I was in Montreal on vacation.  Firstly, let's start with the decor. It was chic and trendy with a touch of hipster, so I was immediately obsessed with everything they were about. Though the extensive line was a bit discouraging, my friend and I decided to stick it out. The wait wasn't too bad, but it definitely helped that there were only two of us. We seated right by the open windows, which was appreciated on a beautiful summer night, and we were given our menus that were a small example of what you could be served if you were in heaven. I chose the chocolate raspberry crepe, and oh my goodness gracious, it was sweet, tart, and absolutely delicious. What I experienced is what I like to call a \"food-gasm.\" It's exactly what it sounds like. I couldn't have asked for a better crepe to make my stay in Montreal perfect.  Though the place was terribly crowded, I did lose myself in the food and found myself ignoring everyone around me. For an establishment to do that was quite blissful."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been here many times (for brunch or dessert) since it is really close to McGill campus and reasonably priced. I love the vegetable frittata! Desserts are delicious as well -- very sweet but rich. The choco-nut waffle is a favourite among my friends. I find the service to be average."}
{"text":"This place is for chocolate lovers!   I saw this place is recommended by BlogTO when visiting Christmas Market. So I was really excited to check this place out. I wasn't too excited about the waiting time though, it wasn't that bad but it was a 20-30 mins wait.   Once seated, I opened the menu and everything was mouth watering. If I could I would order everything on the menu.   I ordered Choco-Nut waffle and Dark Frozen Hot Chocolate. They came daily quickly considering how busy they were.   The waffles were soft, fluffy and light. The toffee nut was to die for. And the whipped cream was light and delicious (and I don't even like whipped cream). Oh and that ice cream, soooo good but I don't know what flavour it was.   The dark frozen hot chocolate was so rich and creamy. But you'd need water to drink it with. I find it to be too rich after having a somewhat rich dessert. It's almost too much for my throat to handle two orders of chocolate.   I will definitely recommend this place if you're into desserts, especially  CHOCOLATE of course."}
{"text":"I stopped by to get a hot drink to warm my hands a few evenings ago. I wanted the Mexican hot chocolate, but it only comes in the larger size so I went with the American-style hot chocolate (dark) instead. It was nothing special - not very dark, not very rich. It comes with marshmallows, and I was excited for homemade ones, but alas they were typical store-bought. I mean, if you're a gourmet chocolate shop, I expect homemade marshmallows!   The place was pretty packed on a Saturday night - I heard the hostess tell people there was a 40 minute wait for a table!"}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant to all chocoholics. As the name suggests, they have chocolate, and lots of it. I love chocolate. The mere thought of it makes me happy, so naturally, I had to try this restaurant. I went with a friend and we decided to share one of the platters. Oh my goodness. It was a lot chocolate. We had a dark chocolate fondue with fruit and waffles, ice cream topped with chocolate, and a grill for marshmallows so we could make our own s'mores with the graham crackers. It was delicious. There were absolutely no flaws and the quality of the chocolate was superior. The only setback with the experience was the service. It was not bad, but the servers were not extremely friendly and we had to go track someone down to get the bill. Overall, I would go back and I recommend it to anyone who puts dessert above all other meals."}
{"text":"Wooooow this place was amazing  very generous portions, lots of fresh fruit, and high quality chocolate. We ordered the strawberry cheesecake crepe and the banana waffle with a side of strawberries. Both were perfect. I especially liked the caramelized banana. The only thing we ordered that we did not enjoy were the mocha's."}
{"text":"Incredible choice of chocolate inspired drinks and desserts. Friendly staff and nice crowd.  Waffles are perfect!"}
{"text":"As I was trolling Saint Catherine's  for street art, I was feeling hungry and saw this little place.Was I ever a happy camper that I did!   I discovered they were only ten days old. Their chalkboard welcomed all its new patrons in this comfortable space.  If you love chocolate be prepared to be here awhile to try their offerings. Upon seating they will give a sample of their hot chocolate they make in house. Then you can make your own custom drink with literally,  a world of chocolate to choose from.  Besides the noticeable array of chocolate, I came in for the crepes they served especially the savory ones.  I ordered the Europa: euro ham, Swiss cheese and parisenne sauce. Served with a spring mix salad and a light vinaigrette.  It was incredible! It completely hit the spot.  Just right amount of dressing with a surprising touch of finely diced onions. Made the salad for me.  The crepe was flavourful and filling.  I finished every single thing. Completely satisfied by the meal and finished off with a nice americano.  Service was fast and friendly. Prices I felt were reasonable. If I lived in Montreal I would be a regular."}
{"text":"People wandering in off the street always seem a little bit confused after stepping inside Cacao 70, but if you are a chocolate lover than without a doubt you're in the right place.    The staff are friendly, they'll get you seated in a nice place with menus and water, and sample of one of their delicious chocolate drinks.  I'm a fan of the warm natural wood interiors and chill feel of the place. Free wi-fi is always a nice touch.  Select from any of their huge selection of chocolates from a variety of regions and they'll turn it into a rich and silky smooth chocolate drink that makes this place unique.  A stop at Cacao 70 isn't complete though unless you sample one of their chocolaty desserts, honestly I drool over every one, but perhaps a chocolate pizza is a great choice, or maybe one of their warm chocolate lava cakes for a more intimate occasion.  Their complete focus on quality chocolate drinks and desserts are really what make this place stand out from the crowd, but as others have mentioned it's a bit pricey.  Over $10 for a drink and about the same for a dessert, add in tips and it's a certainty that you'll walk away lighter in the wallet and heftier through the waist."}
{"text":"Nice place for a rainy afternoon, we ordered the fondue and the crepe, nice service too"}
{"text":"Looking for a date spot? Look no further. Cacao 70 is a great place. I've been to both this location and the Queen W location. I prefer this location, it's cuter and then you can walk around the Distillery.   We ordered the Milk Chocolate Fondue which comes with Fresh Fruit, Brownies and Waffles for dipping. This is probably my favourite thing here, the chocolate can be a bit overwhelming with some of the other desserts and this has the sweetness of the fruits that can cut the richness.   My friend got the waffles with chocolate and vanilla ice cream which was also very good. Everything compliments each other. The coldness and creaminess of the ice cream works well with the chocolate and hot waffle.   I really enjoyed my experience here!   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"Waited for about 20 mins on a busy sat night. You have give your name to the hostess and wait at the restaurant to be called.   Love the bright lights and rustic feel. Very cute for a date! Very cute decor!   Wifi didn't work for us. Apparently, if there's a lot of people using it, it overloads the router.  We ordered the double serving triple chocolate fondue. We initially wanted the single, but the waitress told us it was not enough to share. But, having gotten it, we would have been ok with the single serving because we had dinner beforehand. It was very filling. Lesson learned. The triple chocolate fondue included dark, milk, and whites chocolate. It was delicious. Not too sweet and very silky. The fruits included: Bananas, apples, strawberries, and pineapples.   The mint chocolate shake was really good. Very minty, a lot of chocolate pieces, and just the right sweetness.   A very cute place for a date night!"}
{"text":"Cacao70 était notre seconde option pour ce brunch du dimanche...Nous avons attendu, et attendu, et attendu...une heure pour obtenir des oeufs dans une poêle qui se battaient en duel, du bacon, un peu, des beans secs...le café servi trop tôt avait eu le temps de refroidir et quant aux fruits qui ont suivi avec la \"fondue\" de chocolat, ce n'était pas l'extase.  Une chose est sûre, je n'irai plus !"}
{"text":"If you're a chocolate lover, this place is a must.   It's chocolate heaven.  We were lucky to have an amazing server. She took the time to give us samples of chocolates when we couldn't decide what to get. She was very helpful and super nice.   We went there on a Friday night during the Toronto Christmas Market and got there before 8. The line up was already starting to get packed. We had to wait 20 minutes to get seated and the line got ridiculously jammed behind us. Even if everyone who were already seated were to leave, it still wouldn't accommodate everyone who were waiting. I suggest if you're going to hit this place, drop in earlier in the evening.   Despite the long line up, we were not rushed to leave, nor were timed. There was a couple who were there before us and they didn't seem to be leaving anytime soon when we paid, and we were already there for 2 hours.   I recommend this to anyone and everyone who live and breathe chocolate."}
{"text":"The granola yoghurt waffle with extra bananas is the perfect balance of healthy and indulging. I traded the milk chocolate sauce for the dark chocolate and it was perfect."}
{"text":"AAAAAAAAMAAAAZING! That is all that can be said about this delectable dessert place. I had toasted my smores on the table, and on another occasion had their black and white waffle.   Yum yum - n'uff said! You have to go and try it, but be sure to make reservations! It gets really crowded."}
{"text":"This is by far the best dessert place I have been to in Montreal. My husband took me here and I absolutely fell in love with this place. For all those dessert lovers and bookworms- this place is nirvana. They have amazing milkshakes, crepes and waffles. My personal favourite is the Strawberry Cheesecake crepe. I took my family there as well when they came visiting and they loved it too.   I'm waiting for more out of town family members to come so I can take them here. It's a heavy on the pocket and I would advice everyone to reach atleast an hour before they close to get good service but overall it should be on everyone's 'things to do in Montreal' list."}
{"text":"We came in here as we walked through Distillery District on a cold day, and we did t wait much, but people were forming a line.   I had the mexicocoa and it was very delicious! It had a touch of spice and some sweet. My friends had the hot chocolate, mint tea and mocha and they all loved their drinks.  It is definitely a nice cafe for a quick drink and bite."}
{"text":"Pour les amoureux et les amoureuses du chocolat sous toutes ses formes. Boissons chaudes, crêpes et sous bien d'autres formes, cette douceur déploie son irrésistible charme.  Profitez de terrasse jusqu'à tard le soir. Un chocolat chaud est parfait pour se réchauffer quand le temps plus frais vient à la nuit tombée."}
{"text":"Funny thing. I'm not sure if I really like or somewhat dislike this place. The chocoholic in my loves it. The hot dark chocolate is yummy and who wouldn't like a chocolate dessert style pizza?!? That said, I also find the open industrial unfinished rustic look too cold and uninviting for the warmth and coziness that chocolate represents. The menu, which is a tad predictable and unoriginal, could benefit from more creative dishes and I was disappointed by some of dishes on more than one occasion. If ever you have a hankering for a chocolate & oatmeal breakfast, I'd avoid it here. Rather lacks in any taste and the use of milk chocolate instead of dark only adds to the blandness. That said, do try one of the sweet creamy cocoa oozy dessert pizzas. You'll feel like Miss Piggy, but it'll satisfy that sweet tooth for a while!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!!!! Waffles are great! I was there several times and never regretted. See the photos and you can understand why:)"}
{"text":"It has become a Montreal tradition to eat here and shoot my blood sugar levels to alarming levels, a tradition that I definitely enjoy. My family (mom and sister) came here at 10:30 on a Saturday night. The place was fairly empty, with the exception of a couple of tables. The hostesses were sweet and spoke English to us the second I announced \"Je ne parle pas Francais\", which is the  end of my extensive French vocabulary. We ordered the white and dark chocolate fondue sharing plate with fruits, brownie, and waffle bits. The waffle bids provided were barely anything, but the fruits (apples, bananas, and pineapples) were chopped up and served nicely, and were more than enough. We also ordered the chocolate and marshmallow pizza to go, which was absolutely delicious, if you could get past the initial sugar shock. All in all it was a delightful experience as always, the only reason I'm taking a star off is because the waffle bits provided were very few, which really is unacceptable for the price range."}
{"text":"What a treat!! Sooo decadent.  We stopped for a snack and then couldn't even think about dinner.  Delicious hot cocoa."}
{"text":"Waited for 20+ minutes around 9pm on  a Saturday. Table management needs improvement but desserts were good.   The main thing is the fondue. Dark chocolate fondue was good - how does the chocolate stay smooth without a flame? We had the one with pineapple, strawberries, bananas, brownie bits (dense and moist!), and waffle bits (fluffy!).   I also had a chocolate crepe with banana (too ripe for my taste) which was ok, would be better with some icecream."}
{"text":"Just a heads up, the French menu has lower prices than the English menu.  I had the hot chocolate, and it was rich and delicious as it usually is. Comes with cream on the side if you like it creamier."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in her late one Saturday afternoon as our six-week-old son had started to stir and we wanted a clean place to feed and change him.  We had a great experience!  Our server was incredibly accommodating of the fact that we had as stroller, and sat us in an otherwise closed part of the restaurant where I felt quite comfortable nursing.  Neither the regular nor the accessible bathroom has a change table, but at least the place is clean which is more than can be said for many places that do have change tables.  We each had milkshakes, my husband the dark chocolate and me the raspberry chocolate.  Both were quite enjoyable.  The price difference between the small size and the large size is negligible; we felt that the large is worthwhile.  We will definitely keep this place in mind for when we are looking to eat something sweet.  Reminds me of Juliette et Chocolat, a chain in the Montreal area."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what it is. I would describe it as \"fine\", but I don't think I will be returning to this restaurant after having given it two chances and feeling it was mediocre both times."}
{"text":"Delish! Had the Guiseppe hot chocolate, savory chicken crepe, and finished with a chocolate/ricotta cheese pizza. The hot chocolate had a little kick to it and was amazing to drink real chocolate! Chicken crepe was great with the perfect ratio of spinach to chicken with a slightly slightly sweet crepe. The pizza was the highlight with nutella and ricotta cheese. On the side was strawberries and bananas. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, massive servings. The large hot chocolate was too big to finish for even two people. The waffle itself was great wish there was more chocolate syrup tho. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"If you're in a long line for L'Avenue and you're tempted to ditch the waiting and grab a bite at Cacao 70 across the street, DON'T. Sure, you'll get a seat right away and they advertise brunch, but the place is just a facade. It looks promising, but it does not deliver.   First, the service was atrocious. We walked in and the hostess/server was standing right in front of us, but just ignored is for several minutes until we asked her if we could sit. At which point she told us to sit wherever even though the sign clearly indicated to wait to be seated. She then took forever to take our order. She even took the orders of Yankees that walked in after us first. She seemed annoyed and was not at all friendly--not even in the fake server way. Drinks took forever to come to us and all we ordered was coffee.  Second, the food was terrible. We all ordered omlettes that were over cooked and dry, but also cold. I don't even understand how that's possible. Additionally, the food had zero flavor. It was extremely obvious that the cook didn't even use salt and pepper. Condiments were brought in takeout packets and we were given one each. The potatoes were cold. Not like, sitting on the counter for a while cold. More like cooked hours ago cold.  Third, THEY DON'T SERVE LIQUOR. Their menu days you can add liquor to your drinks, but that was a flat out lie. Also, they don't take USD. First shit experience in MTL."}
{"text":"My spot 4 a really genuine cacao treat. The Venezuelan as a hot chocolate  is my preferred."}
{"text":"This was my favorite meal in Montreal. I want to come back here a million times, alas.  It was 10am and we wanted a french-canadian breakfast so where better to go than a crepe place? And Cacao 70 was even better than a crepe place, it was a CHOCOLATE place that serves crepes!   Boy, everything we ate here was amazing!! Ordered the country ham, cheese and egg crepe which came with a small plate of six whole pieces of fruit with an AMAZING dipping chocolate sauce. The crepe itself was fantastic and literally bigger than my head, huge huge huge tasty crepe!!! We also got the nutella strawberry crepe with ice cream on the side which was even better (naturally, because of the nutella and chocolate aspect), even the ice cream was stand out. Not to mention the stand out cafe au lait and mocha ordered... mmmmmmmmmmmmHM perfection.  All in all, favorite place ever. Need to come back to Montreal to eat here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very warm and comforting feel when you enter. We were greeted by the hostess as soon as we got in and seated immediately. The menu is very extensive and offer English and French language. We, as a table, ordered 'fire it up\" crepes, savory waffles , chicken waffles. For drinks I got there signature mocha in dark chocolate milk and it was very excellent. I ordered my fire it up crepes without cheese but when the order came it had cheese. Our waitress immediately took care of it. Great service, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were on the hunt some late night cheesecake, and I read a recommendation for theirs!   First, let me say that we stated right away that we were just taking out, but the servers still gave us water and a table while we decided. Very nice!   We had the cheesecake and a cappuccino. The cheesecake is very interesting (matcha chocolate, fruit, etc) and very tasty. The cap was all right! We'd get the cheesecake again for sure.   The rest of the menu looks tasty, too."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. I really wanted to try out a different dessert place with my friend and was craving crepes for some time. Upon entering, the worker quickly approached us and seated us right in front of the window. At first I thought it was amazing to absorb so much sunlight, but the sun was repeatedly hitting my back and I did not stop sweating until I left the store and entered the subway station. I hate sweating when I'm eating! It felt like there was no air conditioning. The waitress was very kind and provided us great service. I ordered the Cacao and Fruit Crepe with milk chocolate and strawberries. I didn't have to wait long for the crepe, but the milk chocolate tasted incredibly bland and plain. The strawberries tasted like it came straight out of a can and didn't even taste like real strawberries. They were pink and super soggy. Surprisingly, I finished it even though it tasted absolutely horrifying. On top of all that, there wasn't any wifi! Our waitress' shift ended and another waiter took her place. I honestly wanted to get the bill and leave the store immediately. The waiter never came around to my area and I had to wait like 15 minutes to get his attention. He didn't even mention if I wanted a separate bill or not. Every other place I go to asks me this question. He came back with one single bill so my friend and I just pitched in equally to make everything easier. The waiter never asked us if we wanted back our change and assumed it was a giant tip. We waited 10 minutes and I realized that the waiter wasn't going to come back and give us change. I was quite annoyed as he was extremely incompetent. He was much worse than the waitress that served us right before. The waiter shouldn't even receive a tip and received so much for terrible service. I do not recommend this place to anyone so save your money and find another dessert cafe. I had a horrible experience here and I never ever want to come back."}
{"text":"Had a fondu which was amazing. Loved the spread and the amount of chocolate.   Definitely get the fondu.   The table service was hard.   They only brought a tiny amount of milk out with my tea and then it was impossible to get my servers attention.   Same thing when we wanted the bill. We were sat at the table just wanting to leave for too long."}
{"text":"Just went here yesterday for my birthday brunch with my mom. I ordered the \"After Party Waffle\" and a coffee.  And it was so amazing! I have a serious sweet tooth so all the chocolate was fine by me!  I'm also very picky about waffles and French toast and such and this place definitely didn't let me down.  The coffee wasn't watery or burnt. It was strong and came to our table hot and it was a great drink to wash down all the chocolatey goodness that was my waffle.  My mother ordered the \"spinach and egg crepe\". I took a couple bites and it was delicious!  Definitely gonna order that next time I go.  The restaurant is a little on the smaller side but it's a bright and cute spot.  The service was very good. Our server was very helpful and kind.   I definitely will be going again!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch and deserts. Kids friendly. Awesome hot chocolate! The menu was in both English and French! I had the Lazy Breakfast and my wife had the Spanish Frittata (sorry no pictures). I will post a picture of the delicious hot chocolate!"}
{"text":"All around pretty average and overpriced for what you get  Service was terrible  Wouldn't recommend for breakfast"}
{"text":"What a perfect find for breakfast. The server was super nice & had such a fun and friendly vibe about him. The place itself was cute and homey. My boyfriend ordered tea that was presented so nicely. Omelettes were delicious and the potatoes were definitely a unique twist to your average breakfast potatoes! Compliments to the chef. I wish I had places like this where I live"}
{"text":"Located in the distillery, green P parking is available in the area.   This will be short and SWEET unlike the Crepes I received.   First of, if I'm ordering Crepes from a place that has plentiful desserts, I expect the fruits to be sweet and ripe.  I ordered the basic Crepes with strawberries and chocolate.   Sadly $10 dollars did not provide me with sweet strawberries. Rather, I received what seemed to be frozen, watery, un ready strawberries. They were even pale in colour.  This completely ruined the experience for me, as I am a Crepes lover! The size was not even that big, and they did not put enough chocolate on the top to balance out all the bitter tasteless strawberries.   I expected more from a place whose supposed to provide specialty dessert.   Sad to say that even though this looks like a hip place to hang out with friends, the lack of a decent simple dessert does not make it worth my time.   Sorry but I was very very disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to warm up with a hot beverage while exploring the Toronto Christmas Market on a cold windy day. It may not be totally fair to rate a place based on just one or two beverages but the service was pretty good, the place was clean and spacious.  I had a Moka coffee and my companion had an American Style Hot Chocolate, served with marshmallows. Both drinks really hit the spot and it was nice to be indoors for a while, escaping from the cold. It was a relaxing break, with nobody rushing us out, even though it got busy.  I'll probably be back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I am glad to have found a new favorite hot chocolate location and I foresee myself returning in the coming winter months for it. The hot chocolate comes in a large mug enough to share for two people, unless you want to overdose on chocolate by yourself. It's on the pricey side for a drink but there is plenty of quality and quantity for what you are paying for. They also make breakfast foods, waffles, crepes and sandwiches. It is a limited selection and they are okay, but they are really just the sides to the main reason you are here: the chocolate!  I chose the classic spicy hot chocolate because I prefer my hot chocolate dark and with a kick. It's spicy, frothy, dark and steaming hot. Just how I like it. The chocolate itself is think and rich, coating your tongue completely with every sip. The spice tingles the back of your throat as you swallow but leaves a clean finish without any weird aftertastes. It even comes with a little pile of extra red spice on the side, which you can opt to add in and increase the spice level. I added it in and liked it even more. Will definitely be back when I'm in the mood for a cup of good hot chocolate."}
{"text":"I really loved the place, it was great. Nice ambiance, great staff, delicious food. The Dark milkshake, the Outlaw chicken Waffle, and the Cacao 70 cheesecake are to try absolutely."}
{"text":"If I was rating this place for their coffee and sweets, This will be a 5 star for me.  My kids really liked their waffles and chocolate. I got to try them and they were delicious.  The chocolate was awesome, not too sweet nor bitter. The waffles had a great flavor and texture.   Located in the Distillery district, we woke up early to explore the Distillery district then have brunch at Cacao70 which opened at 11am. Nice spacious restaurant with modern decor.We ordered the Lazy breakfast, egg and spinach crepe, illegal chocolate waffle, and after party waffle.  Best part of the lazy breakfast was the fruit and chocolate dip! The staff were nice enough to give the table an extra place of fruit and chocolate! The ham,bacon and sausage were dry and flavorless. The beans were ok.  My wife didn't think much of her egg and spinach crepe. My kids loved their waffles, and I loved finishing their plates!  From my one visit here, I think the savory items on their menu are not their strong suit.  Definitely loved their chocolate. I've been to Max Brenner's in the U.S. and thought the same of them, but their chocolate was not as good as Cacao70. They have a list of chocolate they serve in their menu items. Unlike Max Brenner's they do not sell chocolate gifts.    I would not hesitate to come back to try some of their other chocolate treats, such as crepes, fondue, cakes,and pizza!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Cacao 70 at Distillery District and had a pleasant experience there. This location was no different. When you walk in they have a cute little set-up, with a very old-fashioned style (and great for pictures, for all the IG fanatics out there). The rest of the place is very cute and cozy. Our server was super friendly; I can't put my finger on why, but I just really enjoyed his service. He was nice and calm, helpful with the menu items, and came around in good intervals to check up on us. I had the Matcha Fondue and my friend had a strawberry crepe dessert (I can't remember exactly what it's called). The matcha fondue was SO GOOD. Any adjustments we asked to make to our dishes, they were happy to do. My friend enjoyed his dish as well, and we even had a short conversation with the people sitting at the table next to us (complete strangers) about how amazing our own dishes were. They are opening a location at Scarborough Town Centre and I am so excited to visit it! Can't wait to try more of their desserts."}
{"text":"As good as it gets! I've been coming by to satisfy late night cravings... and it really does the trick. The atmosphere is chill and casual, and the food is always prepared beautifully and perfectly. The boyfriend really enjoys the americocoa, and I really really recommend the Illegal Chocolate Waffle- the combination of crunchy choco-balls and molten chocolate, with caramelized banana and fresh hot waffle is perfect!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. The server screwed our order over and we waited for 45 minutes. Got both wrong and didn't even care to correct it!"}
{"text":"Loved their choco-nut waffle! Their nutella & fruit ( you choose one, my brother chose strawberry) is just OK, nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Choco fondue, grilled marshmallow and cheesecake. Love the berry sauce on top of the cheese cake!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I need to try this location again, but not for Sunday brunch. I get the Montreal's weekend brunch culture is popular and therefore restaurants become very hectic but there was no organization practiced here at all. I thought we were lucky to be seated right away and on the patio! Score! Except we were surrounded by tables of really needy types of tourists. So my table of two slipped the minds of the waiters I suppose and I waited at least 30 minutes for some coffee. And then waited for food. And then waited and waited for the bill. And waited while the waiter said he would get the machine but cleared tables instead. And I wouldn't be bothered by any of this if I didn't know right across the street in my view is the always busy but organized L'Avenue where even though they are super busy they take the time to give you juice and always refill your coffee. I'm not mad about the experience at Cacao 70 because everyone working there seemed new and like they had never worked a Sunday brunch rush before. And maybe they hadn't. But my lesson was learned. Don't go for breakfast. All that aside, the food was pretty good. I love chocolate so that was perfect, the crepe was okay. I wouldn't suggest ordering a side of bacon. It was that kind that is as thin as paper. Not very good. My boyfriend was satisfied by his omelette. I will try again for dessert someday in hopes of a better experience."}
{"text":"If you want a dessert, look nowhere else, this is THE place!  If you had to choose between sex or dessert, go with dessert from Cacao, trust me. Not to say you can't do both, but the sex just won't compare after the dessert options Cacao has to offer. Honestly, take the extra trip to come for the sweet treats they have to offer either after lunch or dinner elsewhere.   We opted for the Tutti-Frutti Waffle dish (which I would recommend splitting for two) which really had it all; ice cream, caramel, chocolates, dipping sauces, bananas, strawberries, and delicious waffles. Everything blended so well no matter what combinations you laced your spoon with, it was an orgasm coming at your mouth in every bite.   I also went with a chocolate shake to wash it down and they made a proper shake with just the right amount of thickness that you can still use a straw without blowing out your cheeks trying to suck your face in for a sip. If you're only in the city for a day, this is the dessert shop to be at!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival, my group of 4 was seated after a brief wait. The waitress took maybe ten minutes to take our order. I ordered the savoury waffle, which was amazing, and then we waited. And waited. And waited. It took almost an hour for our orders to come out which surprised me considering the place wasn't particularly packed. The waitress did not check on us to see if we needed anything or to update us on the status of our orders. As a matter of fact, the waiter did appear to have a slight attitude. Because we also wanted to try crepes for dessert, we actually ordered it before our brunch came out because we didn't want to be further delayed as the service was as slow as molasses.   Now, as for my order, the savoury waffles, it was amazing. I immediately forgot how annoyed I was about the wait. I don't think it made up for the poor service, but, it at least tasted great. It's a nice melange of flavors and textures that I normally wouldn't put together. I would recommend the savoury waffles if you are willing to tolerate the wait. In addition to the waffles, as I mentioned, we also ordered crepes. I ordered a crepe with white chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Our crepes took about 20 minutes to come out and that's with us ordering them before we ate brunch. The crepe was good, nothing incredible but nothing I can speak poorly of either."}
{"text":"Came here twice during my 3 night stay in Toronto. This place looks amazing and the desserts are even better. You can't go wrong with the flaming turtle chocolate fondue. Ugh! So delicious! Everything was fresh and tasted great. They were also playing Frank Ocean upon my return which made the experience even better. I will definitely visit again when I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"Giant sticky menus, refrigerated counters of chocolates, a happy crowd of people laughing and quite possibly eating chocolate marshmallow pizza for dinner without judgement because why the hell not, super friendly chill service, in general it's hard to not be a fan of this place when you're in the right mood for it. I went with my family after a dinner in the area, there was no line when we arrived and we laughed and were dazzled by the indulgent menu but ended up sharing two ice cream parfaits, one with this delicious caramelized coconut topping and both with brownies, and it was good times."}
{"text":"Service d'une lenteur infinie. J'ai pris le déjeuner des paresseux. Le bacon est du bacon préparé qu'on met au micro-ondes. Les saucisses avaient l'air infectes. Je ne me suis pas osée à les manger. Les patates semblent être du congelé. Pâteuses. Je devais avoir des fruits et une petite fondue au chocolat. Je ne l'ai jamais eu. Bref, la seule chose de bonne etait le café. Je ne retournerai jamais bruncher à cet endroit, je me suis sentie volée pour le prix, versus qualité."}
{"text":"You can't really complain to much about a place that has the basis of chocolate built into their name. What I love about this place is that you're overwhelmed by the amazing scents of chocolate as soon as you walk. Every dish looks amazing as the servers walk by with them.  It's always busy which is a testament to the food.......almost every menu item has chocolate on it, in  it, under it, over it, through it, etc. etc. They did a great job with the ambiance and the location nice and central. Go there! Have Chocolate!!"}
{"text":"Slow service!  Tried there spicy hot chocolate excellent choice. Don't think you can go wrong .. The vanilla and chocolate waffle was excellent, it's can be easily shared with two."}
{"text":"Omg gorgeous desserts here!!!  Delicious in every way possible. That pretty much sums up the desserts. You are allowed to judge them by the cover here :)  But one thing, maybe it was because it was the last day of the light festival, it wasn't TOO busy as it was really late (1~2 hour before closing) but the service was so slow. The man who was serving us seemed like he was high.... he didn't come ask for our order until 20 mins later and when he finally did, he had a hard time writing down the correct item. And then after 5 mins of leaving our table he came back to re-ask what we had ordered LOL....   We forgave him... but let's not smoke on the job."}
{"text":"Cacao 70 is located in the distillery district and is fairly new to the area. Cacao 70 specializes in amazing chocolate treats but also has brunch and other non dessert eats. Some of the items on the sweets menu include chocolate fondue, various types of hot chocolate and milkshakes, chocolate and waffles, toasted marshmallows and dessert pizzas.   My friend and I went and checked out cacao 70 on a Saturday night around 11pm and it was packed! Since it was busy and there was a wait we decided on dessert to go. We both ordered milkshakes, the mint chocolate and chocolate raspberry, and a white chocolate coconut brownie. Everything was amazingly delicious and definitely hit the spot. The milkshakes were rich and chocolatey so it was probably a good thing that we both got smalls. The brownie was chewy and moist but also quite rich - just the right amount to white chocolate, coconut and brownie.   If you're ever in the area and have a craving for something sweet, definitely go and relax and check out Cacao 70. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Friendly prompt  service. Clean restrooms. She had the 'lazy breakfast', a hot skillet of scrambled eggs, baked beans, bacon, sausage (tasty), ham (sugar cured and not to my taste), potatoes, and toast. I had the 'blue mushroom omelette', mushrooms, spinach, onions and Swiss cheese. It was very good and accompanied by seasoned, roasted potatoes and toast. The meal came with a surprise appetizer of fresh strawberries, pineapple, banana and delicious warm melted chocolate for dipping. We had planned to try one of the desserts for which they are known but were pleasantly full after our breakfast and will have to go back again to try the desserts and crepes. She had a hot Americano she said was \"strong enough to bounce a bull\". I was disappointed with a weak nearly flavorless iced coffee. In all a satisfying way to break the night's fast and after a brisk walk back to the Sheraton, a pleasant morning."}
{"text":"I just love this place! It's beautiful, the food is incredible and the portions are big! My new chocolate place! :)"}
{"text":"The food was good. Loved the chocolate with my fruits. I had the crepes and my friends had the omelette. No complaints from any of us. It was a really cute place to hang out during gay pride and the cute blonde waiter was an added bonus."}
{"text":"Now as I am not a chocolate lover *GASP!*, I don't quite have the capacity to fawn over the majority... or almost any of this menu. BUT, I do know that the staff are knowledgeable, friendy, and that the atmosphere is terrific. I have seen cute couples enjoy the fondue sets and have an appreciation for their tea selection. The menu is about 90% chocolate so I found myself eating a Turkey sandwhich, and although it was a little over my usual cafe budget, it was soooo tasty (blueberry AND cranberry sauce - YUM). You can't call yourself a chocolate fan if you've never been, please have the s'mores so I can live vicariously through you!  Food:  8/10 Service:  9/10 - friendly and informative, personalized staff Price: 9/10 Atmosphere: 9/10"}
{"text":"I came in here with a friend around 9pm on a Wednesday and as soon as we walked it, the heat hit us like a wall. This place really need to turn their AC on, I feel bad for the staff. A sign at the door directed us to find a clean table and sit. Staff looked at us and no \"hello\". As we sat down, the table beside us lost patience and left. The place seemed a bit chaotic. There were 3 staffs working that night and they all seemed exhausted (probably the heat). One of them came by and drop off some menu and took our order. Service wasn't the best but decent. We ordered a sweet pizza and the food took a bit of time but worth the wait. There was a lot of bugs in the restaurant as they left their door open and the light attracted all these guys inside. We both jump out of our seat and left quickly after seeing multiple bugs flying and landing on our heads. This place can use a few extra staff and a boost of energy."}
{"text":"OMG! I can believe this place exists! I could feel my blood sugar levels rising when i walk thru that entrance door! I could no believe all the chocolate i could try.  Its wonderful, good quality chocolate. The \"restaurant\" is big, open concept and very warm feeling. From Hot Chocolates to amazing desserts. Definite try!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on the last leg of our weekend getaway to Montreal and were so happy that we did.  The place was pretty empty for a Monday afternoon so we pretty much had the place to ourselves.  Service was efficient and the crepes and milkshakes tasted wonderful.  This is a must visit place to get your chocolate craving extinguished!"}
{"text":"I felt sick after going to this place -- chocoholic problems.   Seriously though, it's easy to gorge oneself on everything covered in cacao goodness, but one must practice self-restraint. This was a lesson I learned the hard way.  Honestly, everything's good here. Why? Cause it's chocolate. You can't mess that up...or can you? *eyes narrows*  I would personally pass on the strawberry shortcake, it was so-so. The chocolate fondue is ace and all the hot chocolates are a must try, especially the spicy Mexican one  -- yummers!"}
{"text":"The food was subpar and it made all three of us who ordered food sick. We came here for brunch and the only one of us who felt fine after didn't order anything. Do NOT chance it. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came here for a little afternoon snack last weekend.   I ordered something called the volcano which was a brownie with ice cream, strawberries, coconut and caramel. My friend ordered a raspberry smoothie and a banana/strawberry/chocolate crepe. The portions were extremely generous and generally the food was delicious. I found my selection to be overly sweet and it caused a sugar induced headache, but I think that was my fault for indulging in such a rich treat. My boyfriend enjoyed his selection as well. We also ordered tea.  My only complaint was that service was really slow at the beginning- we kept getting ignored for a good 20 minutes before they took our order. Also, it was quite loud inside, especially with some crying kids."}
{"text":"I went to give it a try, ordered just a hot chocolate and i was not impressed. I was brought a cup with chocolate syrup and a small container with lukewarm milk. It could have been syrup from the supermarket for all I know. The customer service was friendly and quick, but the ambiance is ruined by too many McGill students who take over the place and scream across the tables, actually, the place seems to be invaded all the time by rude Asian students"}
{"text":"Leur crêpe au chocolat et fraises était très bonne. Par contre, j'ai pris le gateau triple chocolat et j'ai été tellement déçue. Ce n'est pas réellement un gâteau, ça vient dans un bol/coupe et c'était un mélange assez mouillé. J'ai jamais autant détesté un dessert. Le lieu est correct, difficile de se rendre et stationner. Le service correct mais lent. En retrant en hiver c'était très dangereux car l'entrée était mouillée et en pente alors il fallait se tenir super bien ."}
{"text":"Try their Fresh fruits with dark chocolate fondue. Hot chocolate with hint of orange was wicked good too. Fair warning - You may go nuts."}
{"text":"Super excited to try this place... however, when we got there, there was quite a wait for sit down so we decided to do take out hot chocolate instead.  Hubby got the american style hot chocolate made with milk... he got it with dark chocolate and he was like, wow this is quite dark.   I got the mexicoco - which is made with just hot water... boy can you tell it was. It was very thin and basically had no taste, which just the chili aftertaste.   For the price we paid, we expected a lot more...  perhaps dessert would be better..."}
{"text":"Stopped here by chance when shopping in the distillery district.   Staff was very friendly and the hot chocolate and waffle we ordered was amazing.   We were a little  cold walking around outside but this place was warm and comforting."}
{"text":"Si vous avez envie de fondre tel un chocolat à chaques bouchées des délicieux desserts présents sur leur carte n'hésitez pas un seul instant. C'est la référence. Et en plus la deco est très sympa dans un style vintage et moderne. Miam !"}
{"text":"It's like Charlie going to the Chocolate Factory!  Yummy chocolate is oozing from practically everything!  Our waitress, Amy, is the awesomest!!!  Had the waffle--portion is just right."}
{"text":"Cacao 70 is one of my favorite places to go for dessert with friends! Though the restaurant offers actual food (sandwiches,wraps,etc.) as well, I've only ever tried their desserts. Most of the sweet dishes are within 12-17 dollars, are very filling and make a great meal. My personal recommendation would be to avoid the fondue here as the containers of melted chocolate are very misleading and are less than a couple centimeters deep. My favorite dish that I've tried is the Chico-Nut Waffle which is a large waffle served with ice-cream, candies hazelnuts, melted chocolate, strawberries and bananas :) Overall, a great place to be unhealthy with friends and the location is ideal for mcgill students residing in le plateau, the ghetto, new Rez and la cit."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch this morning, and I'm definitely a fan! My friend wanted to take me to Le P'tit Plateau for brunch, but the line extended way out the front door. Since we were in a time crunch, we decided to eat across the street at Cacao 70.  We were seated right away when we arrived at 11:30am (it seems people tend to go out for brunch a lot later in Montreal), and attempted to decide if we wanted sweet or savoury. Lucky for us, Cacao 70 gives you a free appie fruit plate with dark chocolate dip to start. We LOVED this (ordering this separate is $5), but wish it had come at the end of brunch instead of at the beginning. I ordered an Americano, which was surprisingly delicious, considering this place isn't known for their coffee.  I originally wanted to order the blue mushroom omelette, but I couldn't change the order to not include swiss cheese (the omelette mix is pre-made), so I decided to order the veggie frittata instead. The veggie frittata came as a huge portion in an iron pan for $12.50 and included eggs, spinach, tomato, basil and feta cheese, baked in an oven. It also came with a side of whole wheat sourdough bread. I was barely able to finish half of this, and took the rest home as a second meal.  My friend ordered the open faced chicken sandwich ($11.50) and also only had good things to say about it.   My bill with tax and tip came to about $18, which was very reasonable for coffee, 2 meals and the adorable fruit plate at the beginning. I definitely want to come back, but for the sweet menu next time!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had the Nutella crepe and the Mexican Chocolate. It was soooo good! I definitely recommend this place, it's a must try."}
{"text":"Once we got to the restaurant they took more than 20 minutes to even come get our drink order. We order our food as well, and another 30 minutes later the food arrived. I order the triple chocolate pizza. That should have been called the almost-no-chocolate pizza.   The pizza came out as just a piece of hard dough with a few sprinkles of milk chocolate on the top. There was little that could mask the taste of the dry bread you were eating. The pizza also came with a cup of white chocolate, which I decided to pour onto the piece of bread they called pizza, which only made it taste worse. All my friends also tried my pizza and they agreed it was some of the worst pizza they had ever had.   I heard that their shakes and sundaes were fine. So if you go here, please avoid the pizza."}
{"text":"Came here in March 2016 for my daughter's Spring Break. The manager of the shop was so professional & a sweetheart. She made the food and chocolate drinks herself and provided some good hotspots to check out while in Toronto (being that we traveled from Washington, D.C.). She went the extra mile by shooting some candid photos for our memories. The service and delicious food and drinks will always make me a returning customer at this location."}
{"text":"Great coffee and good fondue experience. This place should be a good visit for an authentic breakfast"}
{"text":"Truly the best hot chocolate I have EVER had. I happened to stop in one day when I visited Toronto with my husband on our anniversary. I tried the American hot chocolate with dark chocolate step on top. The hot chocolate wasn't to sweet but so rich and full of chocolatey goodness."}
{"text":"This dessert for place is on another level. My husband and I came for a little sweet treat after some having some sangria. It's has a cute cafe feel and a good sized outdoor patio section. We opted to sit inside in a comfy booth. The sweets menu was totally in French and my husband and I are anglophones. I had to rely on my rusty grade 9 french but we managed to get through. I ordered a banana split waffle and he ordered the volcano. The desserts were large portions, we probably could of split one. The fresh waffles came topped with a full banana with a caramelized sugar coating. There was a scoop of vanilla ice cream along with a milk chocolatey ganache sauce and crispy dark chocolate rice crispy type balls. Beautiful presentation. It was divine and totally satisfying. My husband loved his dessert too. Large portion sizes and amazing attention to detail defines this place."}
{"text":"There's not much that could go wrong when chocolate is involved; and this place knows how it's done. Been here multiple time and have never been disappointed. My favourite is definitely the triple chocolate fondue. I recently had their new homemade marshmallow dish with fondue and waffles for 2 which was also mouth watering. If you have never been this is definitely a place you need to go at least once and leave your diet behind you!"}
{"text":"This is the best dessert place in Toronto. Has more variety than Cafe Demetre and Spin. Toronto really needs to work on its lack of dessert cafes situation. The boutique Asian ice cream stores are great but it's always beneficial to have a place with more options and variety. Anyway, Cacao is great! I personally prefer the Distillery District location over the new Queen St West one, better atmosphere, more open space, and a nice vibe overall. Been here a couple times, the staff is pleasant. It gets busy on weekends, with a line up on most evenings, especially closer to Christmas time because of the Christmas Market. Brunch is alright, not too great. The crepe is a delicacy, with rich belgian chocolate sauce on top. The brownie cup with icecream and strawberries is also delicious. Not a huge a fan of the pizzas, you are practically eating tasteless dough. Again, the best spot for desserts in the city. Your next stop should be Dunk n' dip in Mississauga as there aren't many favorable dessert only locations in Toronto."}
{"text":"We came here for dessert. This cafe is very spacious and had a cozy feel and also very clean. I also thought it was great for larger groups. There is a board with the wifi password for those that require it. The menu has a lot of great choices including fondue. The service was fast and the waitress was very informative. I liked the idea that they also served brunch. We ordered the cacao made with real chocolate and it was delicious. The cheesecake was also a hit. We would definitely return for more dessert!"}
{"text":"Just love this place! Great decorum, good service, and very large menu. Beware of the chocolate coma that follows"}
{"text":"Les desserts de Cacao 70 sont excellents, et c'est le principal. Mais il y a quelques trucs qui accrochent:  - un soir de feux d'artifices, c'était le seul commerce du Village qui était ouvert mais dont la terrasse était fermée (la rue est piétonne, il faisait très bon dehors). Résultat, nous devions attendre qu'une table se libère pour s'asseoir; - les fraises servies avec la fondue au chocolat étaient des fraises de Californie, alors que la saison des fraises est commencée...; - le menu (par sa longueur) et la présentation des assiettes sont génériques, un peu \" banlieue \". Ils ne jouent pas la carte du petit café local, mais bien de la chaîne qui verra toutes ses assiettes faites de la même façon, à toutes les succursales; - les nombreuses fautes dans le menu (par exemple \" Les meilleures choses de la vie sont faites pour être partagER \"), qui a visiblement été réalisé par des professionnels, c'est décevant.  Comme je disais, les chocolats sont excellents (jamais granuleux, à la bonne température, etc.), les brownies et gaufres sont juste bien faits, etc. Aussi, j'ai été agréablement surpris de commander un latté et de le trouver parfaitement balancé, il était parfait tant au goût qu'à la température et la présentation. Le fait que ce soit ouvert tard est aussi un gros avantage."}
{"text":"Je n'y ai que dégusté un dessert, mais c'était vraiiiiment délicieux! Nous avons pris le frappé au gâteau au fromage et aux épices d'automne; MIAM! On l'a tout fini malgré l'immensité du dessert! C'était excellent, les goûts étaients parfaits et le prix très très raisonnable!   Je recommande pour les dents sucrées!"}
{"text":"This place was an experience! Absolutely enjoyed every moment spent here. The breakfast is large and decadent. Each dish comes with fruit and chocolate fondue- how fun! The specialty coffee drinks were fantastic as well. Definitely worth a visit, especially if you're from out of town."}
{"text":"A place for chocolate lovers. This is a cute cafe/dessert place where chocolate is incorporated into every menu item. The cafe is super crowded and on weekend evenings there is usually quite a long line. We ordered two American Style Hot Chocolates ($5.50) to try off their menu:  Dark Chocolate: very rich, almost a bit too strong for me  Milk Chocolate: very smooth, rich and sweet. Definitely recommended for those with a severe sweet tooth   Although I wouldn't come here on the regular, this is a cool dessert/cafe place to try with friends. The setting is pretty casual and it's a unique experience."}
{"text":"Wow!! Love this place, great vibe, perfect for desserts after dinner, whether you are on a date or with friends, perfect to satisfy a sweet tooth. Their desserts look really good, especially the hot chocolate. We got the chocolate fondue because we were way too full from dinner. Got a single order to share between the two of us, the triple chocolate fondue allows you to have three different kind of chocolates swirled in the pot. We had the dark, semi sweet and white chocolate. It comes served with pineapple chunks, strawberry, waffle bites, and brownie bites. I wish there was more varieties of fruits but it's still a good value at under $9. I'd totally go back."}
{"text":"The platter with the banana, pineapple, apple, strawberry and brownie was delscious. I tried the spicy hot chocolate for a change up-it was...interesting...but I would stick to the regular stuff. Good place for a date who has a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Updated with our second Visit (4 days later - Read First Visit below if you haven't done so already)  Second Visit  This visit we ordered a whole bunch of things: - Raspberry Brownie Parfait (again, but the first time was better as it came with chocolate cream) - Quadruple Chocolate Parfait - Triple Chocolate Pizza - Chocolate Nutella Ricotta Pizza - Chocolate Peanut Butter Pizza - Waffle with Ice Cream, Fruits and Chocolate - Raspberry Crepes with Chocolate  Yes, it was insane. The Pizzas were good but we ordered way too many and after a while you can only take so much. One slice per person is enough and I suggest getting something that isn't ONLY chocolate otherwise you go crazy (i.e. Quadruple Chocolate Parfait was good but near the end...). The waffle didn't taste like a waffle, it tasted like a sponge cake that was put into a waffle machine and I actually liked it better this way. As for crepes, it was good but a bit too soggy (too much jam on whatever the liquid was) for my taste. There are pics on my blog!  First Visit  After our visit to Kazu, which if you read about can tell that I was still super hungry (Satya actually cooked up a supper when we came back right after going to Kazu and Cacao 70!) we decided to try out the now chocolate place, Cacao70. I think it was a Presse Café before and the transformation into a chocolate bar was a good one. The place is aesthetically pleasing, well lit and makes you crave chocolate in every way. I am a huge chocolate lover and used to pound down tons of chocolate as a kid.  We started off with some samples of hot chocolate. Despite the varying degrees of sweetness, I must say that the texture and taste of all the types were amazing.  The Raspberry brownie parfait was great. The whipped cream was chocolatey and the ice cream went down really well with the brownies and raspberries. The triple chocolate cake was ok but the cake seemed to be more of a marble pound cake than a chocolate one. I haven't tried the chocolate pizza yet but it seems to look yummy. Maybe the next time I go."}
{"text":"The dark chocolate milkshake is arguably the best milkshake I have ever had in my life.  The waffles were also great and the fondue was good.  The Sweet Chocolate Experience, meant for two, was huge.   The menu is big and diverse with an impressive selection of chocolates.  They also have several items of regular non-chocolate food as well.  The service was good and the staff was knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We ordered the Nutella pizza and it didn't taste that great. The dough was kind of raw. We could taste more dough than Nutella. Not a huge fan of pizza so maybe will try something new"}
{"text":"I came here recently with my girlfriend for a late brunch (thankfully served until 4PM) and really enjoyed the experience although some minor problems with how they cooked my meal kept it from being perfect.   I got the hang-over omelette that was basically a Denver omelette (bacon, red pepper, onion, and cheese). The omelette came with hashbrowns, toast, and a fruit and chocolate tray on the side which ended up being a lot of food. The omlette was good, but not great, the ingredients tasted fresh but the egg was overdone and the vegetables felt a little too hard. The hashbrowns were fine, they were potato wedges dusted in a layer of spice, they were soft and had a good amount of spicy heat to them but I think I'd prefer if they were a little bit crispier or more of a hash, instead they fell in between the two. I found the toast nice and airy and the strawberries, banana, and pineapples that made up the fruit platter were fresh and juicy with a small bowl of creamy chocolate to dip. I got their Moka (it's a mocha) to drink, clearly their specialty in chocolate helped them out here because it was delicious. The food came out very fast and hot.   As for the ambience the entire restaurant looked nice, bright and clean, I'd consider the design close to a coffee shop or a bistro. The staff (and in particular our waiter) was polite and friendly, with my only complaint being that we stood at the front for a bit unsure if we sat ourselves or if we waited to be seated since there was a hostess desk at the front, but the staff just told us to sit anywhere.   So it wasn't incredible and they could probably work on their omelette a bit, but overall I had a good time and would feel comfortable recommending this place to someone in the area, especially if you're in the mood for some chocolate."}
{"text":"The biggest question is how do you choose out of all the options, and what do you get? So many options, so many deserts. Icecreams, waffles, crepes, tons of chocolate stuff, everything you could imagine basically. It's a great place for desert, or even for dinner if you are craving chocolate like I usually am.   Just a note, you never get what you expect. Say you want a cheesecake, you'd expect something simple right? But instead its this huge portion, that comes with chocholate and other things as well, which is sooo good. Portions are pretty good so would be a good idea to share."}
{"text":"This place is heaven for chocolate lovers. I have been to this place three times now and I absolutely LOVE their triple chocolate. Their cake is so soft and delicious. My friend tried their hot chocolate and liked it too."}
{"text":"This was our first spot once we arrived to the city. We had two hours to spare before checking in to our hotel so we decided to check this place out. There are many little shops around to spend your time. Huge selection of sweets and wide range of chocolate based drinks on the menu. My friends and I ordered American style/vintage hot chocolate, triple fondue, and a cacao fruit crepe. The chocolate fondue was really rich and smooth. An interesting part is that you have an option to choose what type of chocolate is used in the hot chocolate. Either milk/semi-sweet/dark. I have to say the service was quick and server was friendly. Utensils were squeaky clean which is a major plus on my list. It sure was a chocolate paradise, a cafe devoted entirely to cacao. I was fascinated at the credit card machine they brought over to the table versus having to wait for the bill and then sign it. It was quick, easy and efficient. Wish all new york restaurants integrate this as part of their POS system."}
{"text":"Best breakfast for anyone with a sweet tooth. Had waffles drizzled in dark and white chocolate. It's pretty hard not to overeat at this place!"}
{"text":"Though nothing beats Suite 88 or Juliette et Chocolat in these kind of chocolate-centered restos, this place comes close. I would say definitely check it out if you are in the area. They give huge plates which can be a good or bad thing. Weight-watchers, be careful!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, 1st class service, amazing presentation!! They also have very big servings, very filling. Definitely recommended to anyone looking for a relaxing, delicious breakfast. We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I am surprised by the good rating. I am not a picky eater or chocolate connoisseur, but their chocolate does not taste any better or different than in an ordinary coffee shop or another brunch spot. Mostly though I was shocked by their high prices and super small serving sizes (I am not someone who eats big portions). Maybe my expectations were too high, but I won't be back and can't recommend this place. Too bad, I was hoping for a nice chocolate experience."}
{"text":"This place is a chocolate lover's dream and it's constantly busy for good reason! My husband and I came here for dessert after having dinner in the Distillery District weeks ago.  I loved the many mouth watering options for chocolate treats and drinks. I wish I could try everything since there were so many good choices here and prices are decent for what you get.  We ended up getting a big cup of hot chocolate (creamy smooth milk chocolate) and triple chocolate fondue for two that came with fruit, waffle pieces and brownie pieces. Omg, talk about chocolate overload - heaven while we were eating and drinking but definitely felt like it was too much about half an hour after we left. I would do it all over again though when I get chocolate cravings since it was that good and it's okay to treat yourselves once in a while! It was pretty much the closest thing to Montreal's Juliet et Chocolat that I've experienced in TO.  Staff were friendly, attentive and efficient despite it being packed on a Friday night. Great job to everyone working at this place for the awesome service because people were coming in non-stop for the hour we were here and the line up had grown even more when we left.  The only con is you might have to wait if you come at a busy time like we did but we luckily only waited about 10 minutes before we were seated. Highly recommend this place and will be back when I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other ones and it's great but at this location it's disappointing. I've been here 3 times and each time it was on a saturday yet somehow they run out early of their house brand of waffle??? The service is really slow because they are consistently understaffed (only 2 ppl waiting on an entire resto ). Honestly their reviews are already bad and they don't care enough to fix their problems!!"}
{"text":"I puked it all out. Too much chocolate. Too. Much. Too. Strong. I got really sick. BUT I love chocolate and desserts and it takes about 3 hours for food to make you feel sick so maybe this didn't make me sick. Still great. Just very pricey. Still okay."}
{"text":"Pas mal sur plusieurs plans (service, plats et ambiance). Seule bémole, nous sommes un peu trop serré. J'ai trouvé de la saleté dans le seau à baguettes..."}
{"text":"The drinks are good, but the service is a bit slow. A pretty great dessert restaurant overall."}
{"text":"Got here right when it opened, only a couple other people. I walked in and was promptly greeted and sat down. I was in the mood for brunch food so of course I got a crazy decorated waffle (After Party Waffle) and a side of bacon to make things a bit savory. I also decided to order a black sesame hot chocolate. You can order the mix of this to make at home, by the way.  The food came out quickly and everything was really presentable (seeing as how Instagrammable all this food is) and pretty much lived up to aesthetic expectations. In terms of taste, the waffle was now a bit soggy from the mound of whipped cream on top. The extra toppings on the side were nice but I didn't even finish it all because it got too sweet after a while. The bacon was a little smaller and thinner than I would've expected for the price.  I think if you're expecting a meal, this could be a place but this restaurant is really good for dessert. The waffles are meant to be for dessert, not necessarily for a meal. The sides might break your wallet and not be as filling.   Overall, I'd come back whenever I'm in a city in Canada that has one!"}
{"text":"Cacao 70 is a nice and cute pitstop that serves a variety of desserts. I was intrigued by the chocolate fondue with all the types of chocolates swirled together. Be careful though because the chocolate container is very deceiving and is only 1/4 deep in that container. Also, be sure to go fast because as you get to the bottom the chocolate will start to harden and no longer melt on to your fruit.   The chocolate however totally lives up to it's reputation and absolutely melts in your mouth. The serving size is also very big and you may find yourself with some extra brownies or waffles by the time you want to leave. Overall, the staff and environment were very welcoming and I highly recommend stopping by here if you are on your way to Graffiti Alley!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the wonderful chocolatey experience Cacao 70! This cozy cafe reminded me of Max Brenners in NYC. Looked like there was a mix of tourists and natives dining here. I'd definitely come back again and again as a treat for myself x)   We ordered:  - Chocolate, marshmallow pizza (came with strawberries and bananas which can be dipped in a small dish of melted chocolate) the bread was slightly sweet and combined well with the chocolate spread and the lightly toasted marshmallows.  - American style hot cocoa (you can get this either with milk chocolate/ medium or dark chocolate) I got it with dark chocolate. Though delicious I couldn't finish it :P  - raspberry parfait ice cream cup (loved the brownie bites in this one!)"}
{"text":"It's great to find a place when you're on vacation that not only satisfies your hunger, but gives into your sweet tooth as well.  While in Toronto's Distillery District I stopped by Cacao 70 for a late breakfast- and a milkshake. You're in a place that is known for it's chocolate and don't get a milkshake you have a problem in my opinion and let me tell you now the the milkshake is worth every single calorie.  I tried their lazy breakfast- eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, and baked beans. I forgot about Canadians and their baked beans until my plate arrived. And it came toast.  Bonus- the dish came with a fruit tray and even more chocolate for me to indulge in. And believe me, I did.  The restaurant had free wifi which is always worth noting in my opinion.  The waitress was very friendly. The location was clean and the service was great. It had a coffee shop vibe, but with a more crisp look.   Definitely a fan. If you're in that area check it out. If nothing else, get a milkshake and bring those boys to the yard."}
{"text":"J'ai testé la version salée donc je reviendrai pour une douceur au chocolat plus tard. J'ai pris une Savoury waffle qui était bonne. L'endroit était désert et pas très chaleureux."}
{"text":"Food and service were very good.  Nothing too extraordinary in their brunch menu but it did the trick!  Excellent that they have a kids menu and offered crayons and paper to the kids - don't see that often!"}
{"text":"Landed there for brunch randomly and was really pleased. Very cute spot away from the downtown madness. Service was great and food was delicious. Menu is filled with delicious sweets and some savoury ones too."}
{"text":"NO NO NO!!!!!!  Ok so the guy who served us tonight, tall white blonde hair, grabs a handful of mini marshmallows with his bare hands and sprinkles on our waffles and serves it to us.   I'm sorry but that's gross and I'm sure it's not up to health codes.   The guy is wiping down tables, using debit machine, swiping cards, moving tables and chairs, handling menus.   Buddy your hands are dirty!!!!! Don't put them into the mini marshmallow jar and put it on my food !!!!!!   He might as well of spit on my food and wiped his nose on it.   Leave the food making to the chefs."}
{"text":"While vacationing in Montreal, we came across cacao 70 cafe. The menu looked awesome, and it ended up being just that. Had to have fondu, the dipping for it was very creative. My favorite was the waffle chunks. Now I must remember to order a dish just with waffle next time around. Our waitress, Stephanie was very friendly and helpful. It's great to be on vacation and have positive people serve you."}
{"text":"I went there with girlfriend on a weekend morning, around 11am. It was our first time, and for nice once-in-a-while outing it is OK.   Pros:  -location -hot chocolate is delicious -variety of chocolates (types, origin)  Cons: -loud -overpriced -serving is not efficient/nor quick (I'm not talking here about cooking per se, as long as it's good it could take a while, I think) -fast food ambiance of the place -was surprised to not find any good pastries: e.g. croissants, just plain baked goodies.   1. Bit too loud in my opinion - the kitchen is open and constantly you hear the noise of making/cooking etc. I prefer quieter places. Also, I had the constant feeling I'm in the fast food place, not expensive good-quality cafe. But again, it's matter of taste, I guess. Maybe I had wrong expectations.   2. Now, I'm a chocolate lover and very picky when it comes to hot chocolate and/or cocoa.  Yes, they serve delicious hot chocolate - I ordered the real melted dark chocolate they serve in fancy glasses, along with hot chocolate base. Yummy.  BUT I was waiting for it for ~15 min; moreover, when it was ready, the girl who made it put it nearby the cashier guy who was supposedly our server. I suspected it was my chocolate but he did not bring at once, he took orders at cashier from several customers, while my chocolate was standing nearby getting cold:( I thought, maybe it's not mine - but no, eventually he brought it to me. The chocolate base was not as hot as it was supposed to.   Also, I ordered a crepe (apples &raisins) and it arrived waaaaaaaay after I was served the hot chocolate. Mmm, I actually ordered to have them together, but who wants to drink lukewarm sweet thick chocolate? So I had to eat the crepe by itself. It was a good sized portion, but crepe was itself nothing extraordinary, it tasted too dry - for that $$ I did expect more.  I felt it should have smth to moisture it. My bill for 1 hot chocolate & 1 crepe came to ~28$ with tax and tip.  3. Overall, I recommend if you are not on budget and you want to explore the chocolate variety. If you want quiet, cozy spot for breakfast/brunch - I would find some other place."}
{"text":"Amazing dessert spot. Restaurant is almost always packed at night so get there early or you might have to wait in line! (granted the wait is never too long). Highly recommend the chocolate pizzas and fondues. I get them almost every time I visit and they're SO good. The chocolate pizza is definitely a sharing item cuz you might not be able to finish it on your own. The fondues come with fruits, marshmallows, brownie pieces and cookies so you can basically make your own smoore. Tried their chocolate drink once but it was actually pretty bitter so just a heads up to people who can't take dark chocolate that well (when they say dark they mean real dark). Highly recommend overall."}
{"text":"Satisfait et jamais deçu , je me régal à chaque fois .. 5 étoiles mérité me concernant !"}
{"text":"We eight people came at 10:15 am and we were the third table in the restaurant. We waited 40mins to get our dishes. The waitress told us it's because a new chef doesn't know how to cook some dishes. If it is true, I really don't know what to say. The brunch totally turned into lunch.  The frittata my wife ordered was burnt. and she had to send it back. The brunch menu all comes with fruit w/ fondue. However, the fruit was not fresh. My friend said the pineapple tasted like alcohol. The fruits were the worst I've seen."}
{"text":"Heavenly! We tried their choco pizza and raspberry crêpe. Both tasted phenomenal. There was s huge line up but the staff tried their best to keep the line moving. The food was so amazing that it made up for the wait. The chocolate collection in the menu was diverse and for all likings. The staff were passionate and knowledgeable about the menu. They didn't rush us at all and for that we were grateful. Great company & great chocolate: a memorable night indeed. I highly recommend this emerging choco spot."}
{"text":"Beware of the relatively big portions in this cacao heaven. The brunch omelettes have a side fruit dish with chocolate to dip in. Both omelettes and crepes are so well sized, by the time your cacao arrives you are already full. If you are cacao lover just focus on it as it is so good and is a meal by itself. BTW you can take your cacao home if you can't finish it. One thing for sure, chocolate beer, import from UK doesn't help either, but tasting a version of chocolate Guinness with your crepe seems to be appropriate although strange combination.   Service in this place is nice, on a crowded Sunday afternoon we were taken care of promptly. The only problem I had is all my cloths smelled deep fried after I left the resto."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I'm really not a chocolate person and just walked into this place with a couple of girls for a coffee... We chose the \"sharing sharing experience for 2\" and let me tell you, it was well worth it. The plate had chocolate fondue, marshmallows, strawberries, wafers, waffles, dessert pizza, and it goes on and on. Every single bite was better than the one before. Although the caloric intake is through the roof, it was well worth it!!"}
{"text":"The chocolate might be some of the best we've tasted in US & Canada, but be ready to pay some extra to eat here. The fruit crepes and hot choco are outstanding, but you can pass on the dessert pizza. It's way too pricey for the tiny quarter of a pizza they give you. Nonetheless, delicious dark & white chocolate. Management can really help by hiring another person because each time we came here, there was one guy working the whole shop, running around like a headless chicken."}
{"text":"With a family that's all about a sweet tooth, gotta say, it's a chocolate dream come true! Can't believe I haven't heard of this place before. You can have chocolate any way your heart desires, it's actually  a little hard to chose because everything looked so good. If you're a sweets fan, do not miss this place!"}
{"text":"The chocolate land! As name suggest its all about chocolate, Its like our childhood fantasy about eating chocolate for food.. Chocolate pizza, and best its the Sharing sharing Fondue, it has all from hot chocolate drink to crackers, ice-creams, waffles, crackers , fruits and marshmallows, as name suggest sharing sharing, It good for four people...  They have chocolate for every one , some light to dark, sweet to bitter , various combinations and range to fit your taste.. Their service is quick and food is consistent all the time and at all the location - Montreal /Toronto/Ottawa ! They do not accept reservation but we always get a place even on Saturday night after wait of 15 mins. It reminds me of MAX Brenner in New York.  The prices are really low as compared to the food they serve. Lovely place for both kids and grown ups. :) Don't forget to try their chocolate beer. Also you get some regular sandwiches and salads just in case :)"}
{"text":"My kids and I decided to go out for a treat. This was the way to go since it's chocolate heaven. My son decided on a waffle drizzled with chocolate. My daughter had a chocolate banana crepe. I had the Spanish frittata. It came with toast and few pieces of fruit to dip in chocolate. The only down fall was no refills on coffee and the mugs are tiny. For 2.95$ just a bigger mug would do. The service was good and we were seated immediately. I can honestly say we all left stuffed and satisfied. Well needed more coffee but stopped at Starbucks for a quick fix."}
{"text":"God damn addictive!!!! Nuff said .. Lol it's like a diner, their sandwiches are really good and the pizzaaa, sugar overload!!! Never get tired of this"}
{"text":"Cacao 70 is perfect when you're craving a sweet treat. Their menu is pretty standard and you'll be pleased with most of it. I wouldn't say it's the type of dessert you dream of indulging into but it hits the spot.   My warning is go in wanting to spend some quality time with someone because the service is so slow. They usually have 2 people waiting their big restaurant on busy nights and they really struggle to keep up.   My favourites are their strawberry shortcake and their banana split!"}
{"text":"Wow the dessert here is so good and satisfying. They really know their chocolate. We ordered the dessert for two for three people which came with a fondue and a waffle with ice cream and two shots of hot chocolate. My girls and I were so satisfied and mind blown by the amazing chocolate richness. I love good chocolate and I know I fell into the right restaurant for dessert. The fondue was so rich and it came with a grill to roast your marshmallows so so cute!! The hot chocolate shots were my FAVOURITE because it was like dark chocolate and so incredibly rich you have to enjoy it"}
{"text":"3.5/5  *The decors were quite nice and restaurant was very well lit, thus it's a perfect spot for foodies to take some Instagram-worthy picture.  *I thought the service was great but it was indeed a bit slow. *they could have utilize the tables better. As these were round tables, they actually took a lot more space and it's hard to organize them if there are groups larger than 5. *the strange thing I noticed about Cacao 70 was that despite having more than 10+ types of chocolate, they don't offer a chocolate tasting menu. We asked to sample some chocolate and was told by a server that they can only allow 3 samples. I think a tasting menu to educate and allow customers to understand different types of chocolate would be a great idea.   -Hot Chocolate: 64.5% Peru - $9.75 The hot chocolate arrived to the table.. well.. piping hot! The plate came with a mug of of regular hot chocolate and the special chocolate you chose in a glass. The chef coated the rim and bottom of the glass with your choice of chocolate, this way you are able to taste your chocolate before the hot chocolate mixture hits your palette. I don't recall what type of chocolate they used in the mug, but the moment you pour the it in, you are supposed to stir and mix both types together. I have to say despite the $10 price tag, this was delicious and I've never had hot chocolate like this before. It was perfectly rich, thick and creamy. Just like the description on the menu, the Peru cocoa was not too bitter nor sweet, yet had a fruity note aftertaste which was quite unique!  -Classic Chocolate Fondue (fresh fruits, chocolate brownie bits and classic waffle bites to dip in dark chocolate) - $11.25/Single The chocolate was really rich and smooth. The mini waffles and brownies didn't taste like anything and it was a bit too soft for my taste, and the brownies keep falling apart while I was trying to dip it into the chocolate!! I also suggest ordering the single to share as it was enough for just 2 people"}
{"text":"I went there twice. Firstly, when I went there, smells were really good because of chocolate!! I forgot what I ordered actually but it was really tasty! I went there with my friend for the first time, we ordered Earl Gray chocolate fondue and regular chocolate one (sorry I'm not sure about the name) because we don't know about share plate!! Second time when I went there, I brought three friends because of share plate! It's good for four people and it was really good!! Most of girls like it I think. I really enjoyed to have it! Specially marshmallow!!!! We could roast it on the table! It was good portion and not really expensive. I think it was around $10 each. The barista is really kind and they explained about menu politely and simply! Honestly I'm not good at eating sweets but I could eat all! I was really happy not really sweet for me! Haha They have a lots kind of flavor about chocolate fondues!! I hope I can try another flavor next time! I'm sure I'll visit there again. I recommend here to have deserts and have a conversation with your friends!!  Thank you for reading even though my English is not really good :) have a good time!!!"}
{"text":"A place completely dedicated to chocolate, ahhhhh!! I was so eager to go, I took a good 30 minutes at home to check out the online menu beforehand. After much deliberation, I picked a chocolate pizza, and decided then and there, that that would be it. If you don't make your mind up pretty quick, be warned, you might fall into a stupor! Will you have a...waffle? a...brownie?a...sundae? The options are mind-blowing, but if you happen to be with friends, a sure bet would be their plates for two, so you can sample everything.  We were seated very quickly, and as so many other reviewers have mentioned, the space is lovely, if a little cramped. I guess what they lack in space, they make up in portion size! My chocolate-ricotta pizza arrived on some sort of marble counter-top, which was odd, and incredibly heavy. Sorta tough to maneuver when eating. The pizza was good, and had a nice balance of salty and sweet. The waffles are beautiful, but I'm not sure the spongy texture is my thing. The mini-brownies on the other hand are great! The highlight of the meal was the raspberry-chocolate sundae. That thing is pure decadence. It's massive, it has brownie chunks in it. Gah! Would totally recommend! I wasn't crazy about the service though. My biggest gripe about the place is actually the chocolate. Sad face. It's very sweet and I wonder if they don't prefer the use of candy-level chocolate as opposed to the purer stuff.."}
{"text":"Chocolate overload. This is heaven for chocolate lovers! Everything on the menu includes some sort of chocolate, except for drinks and coffee!!   It's definitely an experience here - not only do they give you quite a bit of food (or dessert), it's also somewhat presented on the plate. The portions are definitely on the bigger side so I wouldn't recommending getting more than 1 thing per person.   They won't be using premium chocolate, or special chocolatier to create chocolate pieces. But the choices and combos they offer is fantastic."}
{"text":"Love the chocolate tasting menu for two. Mmmm hot chocolate, waffles, fondu, a little campfire for roasting marshmallows.  I've Laos have the chocolate pizza and really loved it. They toast marshmallows on it too"}
{"text":"- Ambiance was amazing. Great place to have a relaxed time with friends. - Recommended item : Chocolate Fondue - Service was friendly and quick - Will definitely try the Hot Chocolate next time - Great place to take chocoholics"}
{"text":"Dessert was good. You have to come at an earlier time aroung 8-9 to avoid waiting. They tend to get busy as it gets late. At least that's what I observed. Portions are big and good for sharing."}
{"text":"We visited the cacao 70 on a Thursday afternoon , i had a very unusual experience . The server took our order and im just assuming forgot to send the order to the kitchen we waited for a good 40 min before i started complaining . And then the brought the wrong order for our drinks and then when the food arrived we still haven't gotten our drinks . But as you can see im giving a good ratting even though we had a somehow bad experience and the food was just average nothing special . But the way that the manager handled the situation and gave a us a discount with out even asking was very nice ."}
{"text":"Been travelling all around the world and I must say this place is amazing. Went there with my date and we had an amazing time. Service is excellent, the ambiance is great. Desserts are amazing and will go back again. Thank you Cacao 70"}
{"text":"Poor customer service!!!! If you see  a lot of people waiting there, it does not exactly mean that the place is good. It is probably because the waiters don't give a F*** about the customers that come in. After 10 min of waiting to be sited,  we finally got a good spot. BUT after 5 minutes the waiter demanded us ( not asked) to move to another table because he wants to put a group over there of three people ( on table for 2) . I don't know about their food quality but the service is Horrible!! If you want a good service, good food go to Juliette et chocolate it is much better , and few steps away"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and this place is awesome   If you like bitter or dark chocolate this place is for you , hot chocolate is awesome and so is their chocolate fondue   Great place for lunch and my 5yr old give is a 5 star because she loved everything she ate"}
{"text":"Arrived here at 11:30pm and they wouldn't take orders for dine in. The server was rude and didn't answer my question at the door and made us wait just to answer a yes or no question. I had to ask the cashier. We ended up going to the other location. The other location at distillery district the kitchen closes at 11:45pm and the servers were way friendlier."}
{"text":"The servers are very friendly and welcoming. We got the chocolate experience for two, the salted caramel milkshake and the frozen hot chocolate. The salted caramel milkshake was okay but the frozen hot chocolate we didn't like at all. The frozen hot chocolate was warm and had really strong flavour. We didn't finish our drinks because It was too sweet for our liking. The chocolate experience for two was great. You get to roast your own marshmallows and there's also fondue. The fruits are really fresh.   This was our second time here and the service was great."}
{"text":"Great hot chocolate and dessert. The hot chocolate ($10) comes as chocolate melted into a cognac glass with a side of standard hot chocolate to mix in creating a delicious, thick, and rich drink. My gripe with Cacao 70 is the decor and atmosphere. Coming here feels like going to a cheap cafe, there's no warmth or character. This is not something I normally put any weight on, but a fancy hot chocolate joint should put some effort into being cozy."}
{"text":"OMG...This place is amazing.  The chocolate is transcendent.  I would just drink the melted fondue chocolate by itself.  I had the choc-nut waffle.  The hazelnuts on it was delicious, beautifully displayed, nevermind the melted chocolate being delicious.  There was a wait on a Saturday night, but well worth it."}
{"text":"After visiting Cacao 70 twice, I can say I was quite pleased by its food and atmosphere. They have a broad menu with an interesting variety of chocolate drinks, food (waffles, crepes, baked goods, ice cream, etc.) as well as smoothies and, for the ones who would prefer eating a proper meal, sandwiches and salads. Their brownies are moist, fresh and warm, and their hot chocolates are rich and tasty, yet not overbearing. As for the waffles they are good as well but, in my experience, a bit hard to digest.   I would definitely recommend this place for chocolate lovers and I am looking forward to visit Cacao 70 again to try something new!"}
{"text":"Visited this little spot this summer and absolutely loved it!   The girls working, were both friendly and took time to explain the menu, gives us recommendations.   The food was nicely prepared (see pictures) and absolutely delicious!   They've got a beautiful sunny patio during the summer season, tons of flowers planted around. Careful for the bees if you're afraid of them. They were friendly but didn't bother us.   Waitress was very attentive and kind.   Great overall experience!"}
{"text":"Don't go here. We came here for Saturday brunch. It looks cute but we waited an hour for food, half an hour just to get a cup of coffee, and when our food did arrive, my frittata was super dry. When we looked around the full restaurant, literally only two tables had food. We ended up commiserating with all the tables around us about how terrible the experience was. Some of them had waited even longer than us for food. Just go across the street and get in the line. The wait is the same but at least you get good food."}
{"text":"This is a great place for desert, they have everything from fondue, crepes to waffles. They have a wide selection of hot chocolates and they are phenomenal.  I suggest you take the platter of everything, it's for 2 people and you have more then enough to indulge in. The only issue I had was the service... A bit slow but overall a very enjoyable experience"}
{"text":"The food here was actually really amazing. Some of the menu items seemed a bit strange but I do recommend you go with some friends to try it. I went for breakfast foods so I definitely say give it a try if you're feeling adventurous for breakfast or brunch"}
{"text":"Awesome place for getting a late night dessert if your downtown! We were super full from our dinner so we only shared something for the 3 of us.   The menu is definitely for chocolate lovers! They have crepes, waffles, Sunday's, milkshakes, fondue, and everything else that your chocolate heart can desire!   The best thing about this place is the first aroma of cacao or chocolate once you walk in the door. It's a small place, but you'll definitely get seated eventually if it's not a busy day.   We got something called the strawberry volcano?!?! It was super rich and awesome to share with your friends. Filled with brownies, coconut, strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, drizzled with chocolate syrup, this is not for being who are looking to eat a lite snack.   I'll definitely come again to try more desserts here! I highly recommend coming here for dessert."}
{"text":"This place is for the chocolate lovers!   They start you off with pieces of fruit with melted chocolate on the side.   We tried the Black and White Waffle, which was recommended by our server. Waffle with scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice-cream, drizzled with white and dark chocolate and whip cream! There was also little chocolate balls and melted chocolate on the side. Absolutely loved it.   We also ordered the Meat-Lover Omelet from the brunch menu. It was what you expect at a typical brunch place, nothing too special.  For drinks we went for the Moka (semi-sweet), it comes in large or small. Delicious and LOVED it especially during the cool weather in Toronto.   Service was great. The waiter was very welcoming and very helpful with the menu although you do wait about 10-15 minutes for a table (but, we also went on a Saturday during the Toronto Christmas Market)"}
{"text":"My sister and I wanted to get an afternoon snack and we were lucky to find a Cacao 70 near our hotel. The menu is full of chocolate decadence, but also has a few options for people like myself who are not so much into chocolate.  There were plenty of tables available at 3PM and we were seated promptly. My sister ordered a triple chocolate pizza and I ordered the Crepe Suzette. My sister was sooo happy eating up the chocolate pizza and my one bite of it was quite good.   Now the Crepe Suzette. The menu said that it was alcoholic but I figured that the alcohol was going to be reduced away during the cooking of it. When it arrived to the table, I was a bit confused. It was a square crepe with a side of vanilla ice cream and a side of the sauce (or so I assumed). I kind of shrugged and poured the sauce over the crepe. I took a bite and my eyes popped wide open. It was straight up Grand Marnier! I probably had the same look on my face as that one time my dad had accidentally taken a shot of Grand Marnier when he thought he was finishing up a taste of Port.   Ultimately really liked the crepe Suzette. I cut out strips of the crepe, added some ice cream and Grand Marnier and rolled the crepe over before eating, which gave me a really great bite of everything.   4/5."}
{"text":"It's got a great hot chocolate called the bolognese with a hint of orange cinnamon spice. Delish. Is bit pricey but quite romantic. A plus for a chocolate lover."}
{"text":"Mon petit ami et moi sommes allés à Cacao 70 par accident. Nous avons cherché un restaurant pour le dîner mais comme il était samedi, nous avons eu de difficulté localiser quelque part avec moins d'une heure d'attente.   Puisque il est de New York, mon petit ami connaît le restaurant Max Brenner qu'il croyait être presque pareille, mais contrairement au restaurant américain, Cacao 70 n'a pas de choix salés pour le dîner. Pour la plupart c'est un restaurant pour le dessert et pour le brunch.   J'ai voulu les churros mais comme nous n'avions pas encore dîné, nous avons commandé qqch moins chère: la tutti frutti graufe, ce qui était trés petit! La graufe seule n'était rien de spectaculaire, mais la glace à la vanille était de la meilleure glace que j'ai jamais mangé.   Je veux bien y revenir, mais pas sans manger avant."}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy day with my girlfriend after dinner. We thought it would be more of a grab & go or cafe style, but it's actually a sit down dessert spot--kind of like Max Brenner's. Fortunately, the wait was short and we were seated within minutes.  I ordered the strawberry cheesecake crepe and my girlfriend got the Earl Grey Chocolate fondue. Both were solid choices, especially the fondue. Something about the tea flavor infusing into chocolate...  An extra 2 cents, if you are sensitive to sweets or have cavities, it's probably best to share something or find another spot. The portions are pretty generous and between us sharing 2 orders, it definitely left a 'too many sweets' after-taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Je m'attendais tellement à un ravissement de mon palais moi qui suit une dent sucrée, mais je n'ai pas été impressionnée. Tous les plats essayés n'avaient rien d'exceptionnels, la gaufre moyenne, la poêle aussi pas si fameuse. On a vu mieux ailleurs et je préfère Juliette et chocolat malgré que je ne suis pas fan. Nous avons tout de même été bien servis et les boules de chocolat à côté sont vraiment bonnes :) le goût du café décevant aussi!!"}
{"text":"Chocolate Overload!! I don't mean that in a bad way either. We ordered a variety of dishes and beverages, and none of them disappointed. We had a Meat Lovers omelette, Waffles, and Crepes. All of which were amazing.  In addition, their coffee and hot chocolates are practically desserts. We were tourists in Montreal, and we knew we had to stop here. I'd recommend anyone visiting to do the same!"}
{"text":"Great place and addition to Distillery District for hot chocolate and dark cacao desserts! We walked in first day of their opening and it was packed!! I ordered their Giuseppe (hot chocolate drink) which was a cluster f of really decadent cacao and cinnamon and my husband got their Cacao Cheesecake which was orgasmic good! Total was $21.00 with tax which is pretty pricey!! Their Decor is pretty nice and with items like chocolate peanut butter pizza, strawberry cheesecake crepe and choco nut waffles I will be back here for more!"}
{"text":"This past Valentine's Day weekend, I had the chance to visit Cacao 70. Coming from the US, it was my favorite meal in Montreal. The chocolate was decadent and rich taste. My boyfriend and my meals were impeccable and my hot chocolate was truly the best I have had. A wonderful experience with excellent food! Looking forward to making another trip up and visiting Cacao 70 again!"}
{"text":"What a little piece of French Canadian Crepe heaven!  It's a great little brunch and dessert spot located near McGill that seems to be a favorite amongst college students.  On a Sunday morning around 10 AM we were seated without a wait.   Fickle as ever we opted for the 70 salad, the Italian sausage frittata and the illegal chocolate waffle.   The salad is a mixed green salad with feta and tomatoes topped off with a poppyseed dressing. It was quite good though I wished I had ordered the dressing on the side.  The frittata was hot, came in a cast iron skillet. It was savory and filling. I was barely able to put a dent into it.   The crown jewel of the meal was the illegal waffle. I will admit I like my waffle crispier than that but besides that it was a piece of heaven. The bananas were transformed into a \"banana brûlée\" with caramelized sugar. The order of operations was to then dip the banana or waffle in a chocolate sauce or whipped topping then top it off with these mini whopper balls. Unbelievable!  They also have a dessert menu. No doubt we'll be back in the future. By the time we left it got quite busy so clearly this is no well kept secret."}
{"text":"Five star except for the loud rap music playing. If you are a nutella lover, you have to come here. Great service!"}
{"text":"The woman at the counter was absolutely horrible to us. Rude and condescending. Left there after 5 minutes disappointed and insulted."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the Max Brenner of Montreal.  Brunch is served from 10 am - 4 pm. It comes with bread, a fruit plate, and chocolate sauce to dip in. I would have been happy with just those three things but of course you have to order one of their fabulous entrees. I appreciated that they brought a small bucket of ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise. The first day we ordered the Spanish frittata and the Hangover Omelette. I substituted the white cheddar for goat cheese. This omelette was so good that I ordered it the next time we came in. My boyfriend ordered the Apple and Bacon Waffle which was a sight in itself. He said it was amazing.  This is an excellent restaurant. My boyfriend and I came here twice during our visit to Montreal. We left both times feeling happy and will definitely return the next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"A good place for brunch and I'd recommend going when you're pretty hungry. I got the vegetable frittata  (with toast) and it came with a mini fondu with strawberries, bananas and pineapples. I wasn't able to finish and probably should have split one meal with a friend. Overall, it's a decent place, lots of seating and dessert/brunch choices for different taste buds!"}
{"text":"Came here around 8:30pm on a Saturday. There was a line up but moved quite fast. Great customer service. I got carried away and got the double Triple Chocolate Fondue. I couldn't finish it and this was meant to be dinner. I'm a big eater. It was amazing though. Our group also got the Chocolate Peanut Butter pizza which was equally great. Definitely recommend this place! Small but great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here after dinner for some sweets and it didn't disappoint. We ordered the chocolate taster for 2 and was very glad the server didn't try to up sale us since there was 4 of us, instead she said it it should be enough to share between the four of us.   The taster came with a roast for roasting marshmallows, fruits, chocolate nibblets , waffles with ice cream and melted chocolate cup. Everything was very tasty and fresh.   It would have been a 5 star rating except the prices were a by on the high side. Compare to your typical dessert Cafe, a waffle or crepe is $5 more at $15 but I guess that's the price you pay for prime location on queen st."}
{"text":"We were excited to come here based on the existing reviews, but were disappointed by the desserts and service. The hostess was very unwelcoming and it seemed like she didn't want to work there. There were tables with leftovers from previous visitors, and no one bothered to clean up after them. The desserts were also very mediocre. We had ordered crepes and a cheesecake. The cheesecake was good, but the crepes were cold.  I wouldn't go back when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"My wife and I thought this was just a place for chocolate. Boy were we wrong.  We looked in and saw a customer with frittata in a cast iron pan and realized the menu must be more expansive.  It was.  We both had frittatas and they were excellent.  You are served with a small platter of pineapple, strawberries and banana with a small dish of melted chocolate before your entree is served. A mini fondue if you will. Delicious.  We will definitely be going back to try their crepes, waffles and sandwiches."}
{"text":"On a commandé l'assiette sucrée pour 2. Service très rapide et efficace! Les gauffres sont encore un peu moelleuse à l'intérieur, une de nous a adoré, l'autre non. On avait un petit four pour faire griller nos guimauves :) La fondue au chocolat était très bonne, c'était accompagné de fraises et de bananes, mais il y en avait pas énormément. La crème glacée maison est bonne aussi. Le chocolat chaud nous a déçu, très épais et beaucoup trop sucrée. Nous avons aussi pris un chocolat chaud-froid qui etait également beaucoup trop sucrée. général très bonne expérience, nous y retournerons"}
{"text":"One word: YUM.  Came here for a late night dessert. We were two couples and we both got the platter for two. One milk chocolate and one bitter chocolate. It came with waffles, fondue, marshmallows, strawberries, bananas and a hot chocolate sampler cup. Everything was so delicious. We were having an amazing time roasting our marshmallows and dipping them into the chocolate fondue. Such a relaxing dessert to have after a long day, if you're in the mood for a sugar rush!"}
{"text":"It's late night, I've been walking since downtown, and the streets are full of boxing anticipators. I'm eager and hungry for some ice cream, but doubtful I'll find anything.Z  Then, I see Cacao.  I gleefully run across the street like any good Vancouverite (read: I jaywalked), and jump into the Open-Signed restaurant with 20 minutes to spare before closing. Or, that's what the sign said, anyway.  The place is almost full, yet I'm greeted almost immediately.  \"I'm sorry, our kitchen is closed\".  Uh...   I've managed both retail and restaurants, including a busy coffee shop that stayed open later than anyone else in the area. Rule #1: serve the customer. Especially if they NEED chocolate. ;)  My reply, after a beat, \"So you can't even scoop me out some ice cream?\"  The lady shakes her head and walks away. I ask her as she goes, \"but your sign says... what time is it?\"   She says she doesn't know. I ask her again, \"I honestly don't know what time it is. I have no watch and just got to Toronto. Maybe my phone didn't update\".  \"Uh... it's 20 minutes to midnight,\" she says unconvincingly.   Me: \"Okay... so you're still open!\"   Staff: \"No, I'm sorry, our kitchen is closed\".  I vow to never, ever return here again and share my experiences on Yelp. I also vow to jump into the boxing brawls with the drunken dudes on the street - cuz that's about how I feel not getting some chocolate in my bod.  As I leave, a large group walks in. I tell them, \"she just told me their kitchen is closed and won't serve me\".  The group persists, and the woman starts to serve them.   Yea, no. I'm done.   Management: you'll never win me back, but in the future, perhaps change your hours OR give your staff some sort of perk/bonus for staying open until closing hours. This was completely unacceptable, especially since the large group after me was served.   1 Star Review: Why? Poor service, non-adherence to posted hours, and frankly... refusing me service for no apparent reason is reason enough."}
{"text":"Despite I'm a huge chocolate fa, theDark chocolate shake was still way too sweet for me and my friends, she has to pour a cup of water in it to make it drinkable, I would only recommend it whoever enjoys sweet flavour a lot. The chocolate marshmallow pizza was good, although, sweet as well, but the marshmallow was grilled very nicely, it's crispy outside and melted inside, combined with the crust, the only downside was the fruit that comes with it, strawberry and bananas, are a little dry. I ordered a hot chocolate as well but I guess the server forgot about it, which in this case is forgivable cause the quarter of the pizza for two of us is already more than enough sweet for one day, and no way I could finish the hot chocolate after the slice, will come back if I ever walk pass."}
{"text":"Warm and inviting environment, spacious and clean, friendly and knowledgeable servers, not to mention the delicious chocolate dishes, this place is a haven for chocolate lovers. Bonus point, they take reservation.   Five of us girls ordered Sharing Sharing for Two or More, a great way to taste a bit of everything - triple chocolate pizza, banana split waffle, chocolate-coated vanilla ice cream, milk chocolate fondue, refillable marshmallows with a small grill, brownies, chocolate-coated cereals, strawberries, graham crackers, and chocolate wafers.  It was a fantastic feast, and even five of us couldn't finish everything. My favourite part was making my own s'mores, it was a fun and tasty experience. Would love to go back to try their savoury dishes (frittatas and crepes) and other sweet offers like hot chocolate and cheesecakes."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing.  The boyfriend and I stayed at a close by B&B in Montreal this year and decided to stroll down the street one night looking for dessert like places.  I stumbled upon this little chocolate cafe and decided to give it a try.  We ordered the fruit crepe and a semi-sweet chocolate with a shot of rum.  They were so delicious!  The chocolate had great flavors.  It was the best chocolate I had so far."}
{"text":"The food is here quite delicious, but the service was so terrible that I would never come back. We were a group of 7 with a reservation (that we confirmed days before we came) but when we arrived we were told there was \"miscommunication\" and waited half an hour. We were made to feel that the error was on our end when it wasn't. The server was extremely rude and had a terrible attitude. Every interaction seemed to annoy him, and we were made to feel stupid for asking simple questions. Some of the meals didn't come with everything; for example, when one of us asked for the missing yogurt sauce, the server rudely shot back with \"you want two?!\" A side order was also forgotten (it was brought out later), and one of the crepes didn't have the ingredients represented on the menu. Bills were split (which was great) but one person paying for two bills made our server upset. She even apologized for inconveniencing him and he just ignored her. To top it all off, since we were a group of 6+ we had an 18% gratuity automatically added to the bill, otherwise we would not have tipped that much. We all felt super poorly treated and it's too bad considering the place has yummy food and an otherwise pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal!  (Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)  Absolutely amazing! I always recommend this place to all my friends who visit Montreal. This little restaurant is an absolute gem. The place is very well decorated and very unique. Definitely in my top 5 places to visit if you ever pass by this beautiful city.   I always get the \"sweet chocolate experience for two.\" This place is the perfect place to go on a romantic date or have a great time with friends. What is more hilarious than laughing at each other with chocolate stuck on everyone's teeth? :)  I would also recommend the crepes as they are really tasty as well! To be honest, anything on this menu is good. Highly recommended and a solid 5 stars! Well worth it I promise you!"}
{"text":"As a sweet lover and a chocolate lover I absolutely adore this place and have been there so many times. The chocolate fondue is my favorite but it can be a little too much for one. Waffles are just delicate with their ice cream but Their brownies are somehow dry and greasy.Last time I went the hot chocolate I ordered was just warm and not hot at all, and the servers were not very responsive... I was disappointed?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning for brunch with a group a 5. The wait was 45 minutes to be seated since it was the brunch rush.   The service was slow because it was crowded, so beware if you are extremely hungry and you want to be seated right away.   The food was good and tasty and even got a free fruit platter for the long wait. Everyone was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Cacao 70 is a standard version of chocolatier / dessert places these days. With many other options for patisserie, ice cream and crepes, Cacao 70 wouldn't be my first pick unless you were craving chocolate fondue. I ordered the volcano which was a brownie with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, caramel / strawberry and chocolate sauce. The brownie was alright but I have a particular aversion to 'generic-tasting' vanilla ice cream so I was disappointed to see that a joint specializing in dessert wouldn't invest more into a high quality vanilla ice cream. Other than that the sauce were pretty average, nothing to rave about. On top of the taste, the value for money isn't great considering a single brownie dessert is $8-14. Still, Cacao 70 deserves three stars for its convenient location, attentive staff, clean environment and average desserts."}
{"text":"If you want to get your sweets / chocolate fix, this is the place to go.   I went on a sunday night around 9PM and there was a short line up.  We decided to go for the Choco-nut waffle and the Strawberry shortcake. Both delicious, except I found the shortcake a bit too dry. Would have added a bit more of strawberry syrup to make it more moist.  Our waiter was nice and helpful, and service was quite fast."}
{"text":"TLDR: Food is excellent. Atmosphere is interesting, service is prompt and the menu items unique. Highly recommend the banana split waffle. Random hordes come in so you may have to wait a bit but it is worth it.   The fruit is fresh and well washed. The tables and whle place is very clean and the servers have a personality and are not afraid to chat with you. There are ample savory choices but the chocolate is what you should come here for. As a savory, the spinich and fetta crepe was good but khought it could use a bit of sauce as there wasn't anything to bind it."}
{"text":"This place was really nice and a fun way to finish off a night. My two friends and I split 2 single fondues. We definitely recommend the peanut butter chocolate one. Really cute place and friendly staff. The lighting was a little bright but maybe that's just me. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great location for places  to check out around the city. The quality was good - but my waffle was soggy :( the service was so so :| Would I go again? Probably not. Moroco does an excellent chocolate fondue, other dip and dunk places around the city. No where near as good as Max Brenners."}
{"text":"I loved how they had an english menu but it was small and we still used the main menu which was all written in French! It was hard to decide what chocolate drink to try. I don't remember the name of the drink I chose but it was very chocolatey! I was hoping for some whipped cream or something fancy on top of it but I still enjoyed it. My boyfriend ordered some egg dish and I tried a bite. The ham was delicious! Probably the best I've ever eaten! I found myself asking for more, and luckily he was kind to share! We ordered the milk and white chocolate crepe but my boyfriend asked for all white chocolate. It was very sweet for me but my boyfriend really enjoyed it-he has a sweet tooth! We really liked it had free wi-fi since we both don't have international plans for our mobile phones. I don't really recall the prices but since we are from Los Angeles we didn't think it was any different. I also liked the waitress wasn't pushy for us to leave. We really enjoyed our time here especially since it was our first stop during our Montreal trip."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing food. Seriously recommended. And the staff were lovely even though we showed up close to closing.   Seriously though, if you love chocolate, come here."}
{"text":"Came here for some hot chocolate with the beau. Can't remember the name of the hot chocolate I ordered but it had cinnamon and a hint of orange in it. The beau had a spicy dark hot chocolate with cayenne peppers in it.   Both were tasty, but be forewarned, they are extremely thick in texture and rich in flavour; unlike regular hot chocolates, the cup of cacao tasted like drinking melted chocolate, so make sure to leave some room in your stomach..   I preferred the beau's cup of dark chocolate, but too big of a cup and too rich for one person unless you're a serious chocolate lover.   We were so full we didn't have room for dessert, however the chocolate fondues looked delicious.."}
{"text":"Très similaire à la franchise Juliette et Chocolat avec un focus central sur les desserts, Cacao 70 ont une panoplie de desserts chocolatés et incluant des boissons chocolatées.   Le prix sont raisonnable et on voit que ça touche une scène plutôt jeune. Cacao 70 est très bien situé et offrent une destination de choix dans le \"deuxième quartier chinois\" de Montréal.   C'est certainement un endroit où je retournerais s'il y avait un restaurant dans le coin ou j'irais mais je ne ferais certainement pas de détour pour y aller. C'est un endroit qui peut être idéal pour les gens avec un bec sucré et qui n'aime pas nécessairement le café ou l'alcool.  J'ai pris le chocolat au lait mexicain. C'est un lait au chocolat épicée et très très crémeux. J'ai mangé un morceau de gâteau au fromage et l'ensemble, moi qui ait le bec très sucré, m'ont satisfait mais c'était à deux doigts d'être trop sucré pour moi.   J'aime le concept de ces endroits très chocolatée et je reconnais une certaine originalité au menu dessert mais j'aimerais certainement y voir un menu plus balancé. Parce que tout choix non-réfléchi dans la sélection vont faire en sortent qu'on est un peu écuré par l'overdose de sucre.   Donc, du thé? du lait (de chèvre, ou Fermier quelque chose d'onctueux). Des mets plus complexes. C'est le genre d'élément manquant ici."}
{"text":"Cacao 70 is a ultra chocolate themed restaurant on trendy mount royal (a cross between Williamsburg Brooklyn , Wynnwood near miami and Chelsea New York.The restaurant..of course has strong  wifi  and abundant electric all outlets. More importanly it boasts chocolates and cocoa from around the world and has dark chocolate menu items which seem awesome. Prices seem fair. I had a dark chocolate mint frappe which was delicious and refreshing. ."}
{"text":"Very cute and comfortable spot for some delicious rich chocolatey goodness ! I've been a few times and have always enjoyed my order and the service. Everything from the fondue to the hot chocolate to the waffles will satisfy your sweet tooth. There is usually a lineup to get inside but I can't say I have ever waited overly long amounts of time to be seated."}
{"text":"went here because i was craving matcha and hot chocolate and since they have their holiday special, i decided to go here.   I got the matcha hot chocolate - very tasty! the hot chocolate wasn't too hot that it was burning my tongue. the flavours blended well together - the matcha flavour hit you first then you get a sweet taste of chocolate afterwards. i got mine to go so i missed out on the decoration of the foam. i wish the size was bigger - it was literally the size of a dixie cup for $6.50 - but well worth the money"}
{"text":"This is my new go-to place for crepes, chocolate, and anything desert. Freshly made treats, great selection, reasonable prices, excellent service all in a beautiful setting in the Distillery District. They also serve the various sauces, toppings and fruits on the side, that way you can customise the sweet creations you order."}
{"text":"Chocoholic. Period.  Any chocolate lover should come here. The atmosphere is pretty casual and is a pretty good hangout with friends, but not to the point it's super crowded and uncomfortable.   Their name says it all - chocolate. The fondue was amazing (you'll want at least 2 people for this); you get choices of fruits like strawberries, bananas, pineapple, marshmallows, chocolate brownie cubes (yup, more chocolate) and other surprises. My personal favorite was the brownie cube, it was super soft and chewy and would go great alone or dipped in some MORE chocolate.   Also, give any one of their waffles a try - it's just more chocolate-y goodness. It might be a good idea to walk to this place as opposed to driving so you can find a place to burn off all that sugar you just inhaled.  Just looking at their pictures makes me want to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome place for any meal but particularly for weekend brunch as they offer a little bit of everything to please anyone, with a major focus on chocolate.  I've had chocolate fondues, as well as the salty crepes with chicken etc, and was always impressed.  Their smoothies are always fresh.  Service is very nice and pretty fast. The one downside is the price. It's aligned with Juliette et Chocolat which would be their main competitor, but on the more expensive side compared to other brunch places."}
{"text":"Ordered the vintage hot chocolate and a latte, almost 30 minutes later we get two cold drinks. We asked them to warm it up but the server was a bit rude. Shit service but they may have been short staffed. Would not recommend unless you have over an hour to kill to get a drink."}
{"text":"If you love anything-and-everything-chocolate you owe it to yourself to indulge here. Aside from satisfying my cocoa cravings, the food here gave me the sexual appetite of a demon rabbit. Long story short, my wife and I missed out on a lot of sleep."}
{"text":"Yay Christmas market in the distillery got a brand New cute dessert cafe. It's located where the spidery sculpture is in the side alley way. Known for gourmet chocolate.   Had a choconut waffle and raspberry brownie parfait. Price wise, it is a little bit on the higher end than other dessert places I've been to. The chocolate fondue also seemed like a popular choice among customers.   Getting a lot of business from the xmas market, I find that the cafe is popular with young women. We got a seat right away for our group of 4. Server was very friendly, attentive, and cute and checked in on our group often.   Decor is cute and trendy cafe."}
{"text":"Even though I was difficult tonight Catrina gave my friend and I a patient great service. At first I was kinda disappointed, but I think she over heard our comments and make sure we left happy. Thank you Catrina for the experience. After all we had a great time. Food (CHOCOLATE) was Great!"}
{"text":"Walked in around 4PM on a weekend. The place was pretty packed but we were able to find a seat right away as we were a small group. Friend got the waffle and i went for the fondue. Both were good with really nice presentation, however unless you've got a serious sweet tooth this wouldn't be something i recommend. Both our totals came around under $20 tips included. Our server was super nice, helpful, and attentive.   Reasons this place isn't 5 stars.  1. We asked one of the other servers for assistance since ours was halfway across the room, and we were kinda blown off.  2. It's pricey. I know i know pretty much all trendy places are pricey and this place was no exception, but still $14 for a waffle?! (Price is an estimation. I don't recall specifically)   Anyways if you're fond of sweet things (and i mean SERIOUSLY fond, i couldn't even finish my fondue and i have 7 fillings from my sweet eating habits), this is a cute place to stop for a nibble."}
{"text":"This was a great place for brunch. I recommend getting the frittata brunch which comes with a side of fruit and chocolate fondue. There is an expansive chocolate menu but they also have great breakfast items!"}
{"text":"This is the sort of place that looks good on paper. An all chocolate restaurant? What a brilliant idea! Of course then you try it and it's good, really it is but it's expensive and well, it's fucking chocolate. You could melt your own to your tastes and not pay this much. The other problem is tha it's so rich, after a few bites, you're full from the 18$ treat you just got.   If you're going to eat here, bring a group and share everything so you don't waste money on being full and queasy seconds later from a cocoa overload."}
{"text":"Quatre étoiles pour les portions gargantuesques (petits appétits, adeptes des diètes, en attente d'un diagnostique de diabète, optez pour le partage). Mention spéciale à la gaufre banana split. Belle et succulente création. Le service est très courtois et l'ambiance est agréable.  Laisser tomber la belle de Roméo à quelques rues de là. Cacao 70 lui a damé le pion et il n'utilise pas de Nutella, LUI!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited my cousin in Montreal three weeks ago. We got to try a popular chocolate dessert cafe/restaurant called Cacao 70. They offered a limited selection of coffee drinks but I wasn't there for the coffee. Since it was brunch time, I was desperate to have some content into my stomach. I didn't want to order dessert because I had nothing in the morning and didn't want to be filled up on sugar. So I ordered one of their savoury crepes, The House Special (I think, I'm basing it off their online menu since I forgot to record it). It came with fruit appetizers that you could dip in chocolate before the main entree came. I definitely enjoyed the food! It was not crazily mind-blowing and unique, but it definitely gave me a fill and I was definitely content.  I really liked the atmosphere and their chocolate-themed restaurant. You could also buy chocolate to take back with you if you wish. I didn't buy any only because they were a bit pricey for a bag.  If I was to come back to Montreal (which I obviously am), I would definitely try their dessert crepes. Even if you hate chocolate (like my boyfriend), there is definitely something there for everyone."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for dessert and they have never disappointed me. Today I decided to try their brunch and I am sad to say that I will not be returning for brunch.  The service was fast and courteous however I ordered the spinach and feta crepe with eggs. I asked for the eggs well cooked and they came runny, I sent them back and they came back runny.   The crepe was okay but contained 95% spinach with a few speckles of feta.   I was extremely disappointed. Montreal is full of great restaurants, if they are going to do brunch they need to step up their game.   1 star and that's for the server."}
{"text":"The best chocolate and brunch restaurant. Its a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy all kinds of chocolate foods including pancakes, foundues, chocolate pizzas and much more! Go check it out you wont regret it!!"}
{"text":"I had the half portion of the chocolate marshmallow pizza, and it is VERY sweet, but good! I went with 3 other people and we each had a slice and were satisfied. Although it would have tasted better if the dough part was crispier.   I also had the grilled vegetarian sandwich, and it was extremely bland, I wouldn't recommend it!  Also had the Milk Chocolate Milk Shake - AMAZING! very tasty!  The service was EXTREMELY friendly!!! Very good service! Atmosphere is also really comforting and relaxing!"}
{"text":"One of two favorite Chocolatier places to try out in Montreal. Multiple locations. We ended up wandering the streets of St Catherine's and ended up there on the patio. Hot day so I tried the NY chocolate Martini which didn't disappoint. Decor indoors was fun.  Definitely promoted the neighborhood feeling and staff were friendly enough. Reasonably priced with many options of different types of food and desserts - open late to enjoy."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience in the flagship location but decided to give them a second try at their location on Parc avenue and oh my, what a difference!!  I think I just had the best-cook waffle ever! Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside! Love it!  The ambiance was great, on a Sunday night, not too crowded, a great place to spend the last moment of a weekend with the love one!  Next time I'll go back there to try their salty menu!"}
{"text":"We ordered the banana split waffle as we usually do, but this time isn't the best I ever did.  The waffle first came in raw... And the mix batter was still leaking out so we advised the waitress she said they will make another order.   Few minutes after, the waitress brought it back, yes they did make another waffle but everything else were from the previous plate, you can see the vanilla iced cream already half melted. The worst part is, they really did made sure the waffle is fully cooked... It turns out to be over cooked. You can see the burnt area on the waffle AND the banana. Instead of a sweet desert it turns out to be a bitter desert due to the burnt area. See picture below.  So my advice to you, eat the raw waffle.. Don't complaint..."}
{"text":"Oh yeah! This place knows a thing or two about good hot chocolate, waffles and crepes. If you're craving something sweet, you owe it to yourself to visit Cacao 70. My personal favourite is Cacao 70 Vintage Strawberry Shortcake for $10.25. The service was prompt, the atmosphere was good and did I mention their Grilled Marshmallows Cacao? mmmm it's delicious. I'm salivating just thinking about this place. If you have a sweet tooth, you'll be thankful you stopped by that place."}
{"text":"The ultimate dessert and chocolate place - must try!  I'm well acquainted with Juliette and Chocolat which similarly specializes in decadent chocolate treats from hot cocoa to crepes, although I think Cacao 70 has a far greater selection. If you want to accompany some friends but aren't a chocolate enthusiast, they even have salads and wraps.  Went on a Friday evening and it was pretty packed. There's a very cozy feel to the place, it's warm and a great setting for a date or groups to share good times over a huge fondue.  I tried the tutti fruiti waffles served with a drizzle of milk chocolate, strawberries, caramelized bananas and vanilla ice cream on the side. For 13.50$, it is worth the size of the portion and could be filling as a meal itself. I also got their american style hot chocolate milk, which was extremely rich - I'm pretty sure there was more chocolate than milk in it and if let to cool down, it would solidify! Unfortunately it just gets too sweet and sickening, I was not able to finish everything I ordered despite having a light dinner beforehand.  There should be a warning to consume in moderation. I will be going back as I'm eager to try some of their lighter desserts like crepes or cakes or perhaps just for a drink, they have smoothies and milkshakes too."}
{"text":"Came in tonight at 9:45pm, the moment we walked in the waitress gave us, A group of 5, the dirtiest look. We stood at the door to be seated for about 4-5mins and decided to seat ourselves, there wasn't even any music playing. Just silence and the sound of people eating and cutlery. The waitress brought us menus and told us that the kitchen was closing at 10pm though the place closes at 11pm. She said they were closing early because one of the cooks were sick and she was the only waitress working. Complete trash response for the way she spoke to us and the attitude that was coming off of her. She placed menus even though we said it was fine and that we would leave, and didn't say a word to us, anything like \"Sorry, please come back another time.\" Absolutely zero customer service. Trash, don't come here, the wait is better at the Atwater location. Restaurant wasn't even full. Trash yo. I work in the industry and have so for 5 years, I understand her situation, but she was just garbage altogether."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for chocolate lovers. Everything is chocolate and there's so many different types to choose from! From French style white chocolate to dark chocolate from Costa Rica, they've got it all.    We went to the distillery district location and it was cooped comfortably in between the beautiful bricks. The decor inside is alluring and made it feel very relaxing. It was the perfect place for catching up with an old friend.   As for food, it was like dessert heaven. We got the black and white chocolate fondue (definitely recommend this!) to share, which came with fresh fruits, waffles, and brownies. We also got the house special salted French crepe which was also savoury and good. They stuffed it real nice with chicken, mayonnaise, parsley, baby spinach and cheddar cheese. For drinks I got the chocolate milkshake (the added Icecream is to die for) and the Moka, which is an expresso with hot chocolate. They also gave the choice of chocolate too (milk, semi-sweet or dark).   This place is quite pricey, but if you don't mind paying for the high quality chocolate, would definitely recommend for anyone to stop by, especially for a hot chocolate drink on a cold day."}
{"text":"Great desserts! Chocolate with everything. But get early. Had to wait like an hour to get seated"}
{"text":"Chocolate and dessert places will not escape me! I've been here once before and I decided to come again with a friend for her birthday. It was a delightful experience and we had the following:  1. Italian Sausage Frittata ($13.50) This had some healthy vegetables in it and the presentation was cute - came in the pan itself! This brunch item also came with a side of toast and some fruits and chocolate to dip! I wish the sausage pieces were a little bigger but it was so tasty overall!  2. Strawberry and Cheesecake Crepe ($14.50) This came with vanilla ice cream with milk chocolate and some strawberries with strawberry sauce on the side. The best crepe I've ever had the chance to eat! I was expecting some cheesecake pieces in a crepe but it's not that! There were separate ingredients put together to make it taste like a super light cheesecake that you can't get enough of! If we weren't so full from the brunch frittata, we would've definitely finished it!  3. Large Mint Chocolate Milkshake ($7.95) This has chocolate and mint ice cream in it and it wasn't as thick as I anticipated but it was pretty heavy. Still enjoyable but once it started melting, we couldn't finish it anymore.  The server was really nice and seemed knowledgable when I had a few questions. Also, we asked for the crepe to follow the frittata and they served it just as we were finishing up with the frittata! Perfect timing! I was so impressed! If it wasn't for it being a little more on the pricey end, this would've been 5 stars without a doubt! I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to-place for a delicious warm hot chocolate or whenever I'm in the mood for a sweet treat! They really do a good job at fulfilling my sweet cravings! Nice warm  and cozy place with plenty of options on the menu at affordable prices. Sometimes, there could be a line up depending on peak hours, and the place is relatively small in size so it could get pretty packed easily. But it's all worth it... Their dishes are sometimes too pretty to eat ;) A great place to have brunch, lunch, catch with a few friends, bring a date and of course, satisfy all your chocolate fantasy... Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Nothing to say about but their hygiene!!! Dirty knife, fork and table. Server brought us to the table not even wiped and we had to wipe the table ourselves. I attached photo of the dirty fork. Server didn't even looked at us when we called him and of course didn't say sorry. That is ok cuz he didn't wash the dish but the problem is he said sorry to the next table with same problem as we had, dirty fork and knife!!! Is he a racism or something? He didn't feel any sorry cuz we are Asian?? Anyway wort experience ever in Toronto. Oh!! and food sucks. cheap icecream and coffee beans. Don't understand why they named cafe \"cacao\". Their chocolate tasted like store bought chocolate. I will rather go to whole food to buy regular chocolate to melt it and eat at home..."}
{"text":"I totally love the hazelnut pizza. It is out of the world! Perfect for me. It is not super sweet. I tried their few drinks and was not that happy about that."}
{"text":"What a great place to bring your date! Their desserts are very good after a nice hearty meal from any of the many restaurants on St. Catherine.  Their crepes and fondue are simply decadent!"}
{"text":"We came in at 10:05 pm and they close at 11:00 pm and the waiter only allowed us to order Togo. We are fine with that. She gave us our order and forgot our chocolate shake and we came back to our hotel realizing they forgot the fruits to our dessert pizza. I paid pretty much paid $13 for two slice of pizza dough with chocolate sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Walking back to our place after a show at the Comedy Nest, I nearly stopped in my tracks when I saw this cute restaurant. A snap decision to get dessert is always a good idea! The menu is extensive and it's hard to choose what chocolate creation to get, but we finally decided on the triple chocolate fondue. Consistency was velvet smooth, artfully swirled with the perfect amount of dipping accompaniments. Wish this place was in the states!"}
{"text":"Very bad service the glasses smelled of eggs the plates smelled of eggs we were told to sit infront of an open door in minus temperatures and when asked by the server if he can close the door he says no the owner wants it open i thought the customer is always right. secondly the server was alone working in the whole restaraunt serving 4-5 tables. worst experience and i wont go here ever"}
{"text":"I always come to Cacao 70 for their hot chocolate selections. Although it is on the pricey side, they have a menu just for hot chocolate, which lets you choose the percentage of cacao you would prefer. I am a dark chocolate fan so I have always ordered from the top of the menu (around 70% cacao) and it always keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Tried this dessert place since I work nearby.  It is not ideal for large groups since the place does not have too many tables. We had a group of 12 and waited for tables to leave before being seated.  The menu has quite a variety of desserts - though rather expensive compared to other places.  We ordered the chocolate fondue that came with fruits and brownies. This was delicious! Only thing that I found odd was that the fondue did not come with a candle under it to keep it warm."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with my friend and at the get go I really enjoyed the overall aesthetic and atmosphere of the cafe. It was very chill and relaxed. There was a lot of open space and had that nice warm and cozy feel which is extra nice since it is getting cold outside. They have a great menu but I sticked to what I know and ordered a triple chocolate cake and it was delicious! I loved it so much I want to go back!!"}
{"text":"Le nouveau Cacao 70 est arrivé dans le Ghetto McGill ^^ yeah ! Comme d'hab, un lieu pour les amateurs de chocolats de toute sortes. Ma crêpe aux bananes + cacao (9$) était délicieuse + bon petit moka (4,95$) aussi. Le chocolat ''équateur 76%''  (9,25$) était de qualité et vraiment onctueux. Il n'y avait aucuns clients en pleine après-midi. À mon avis, j'aime mieux Cacao 70 que Juliette & Chocolat, qui est surestimé à mon avis. La jeune serveuse était sympa et le service fut rapide. Prix ok. Je reviendrais sûrement pour essayer leurs brunchs. Le wifi gratuit ne fonctionnait pas lors de ma visite. Pour ceux qui ont la dent sucrée que ce soit pour de chocolat de qualité, crêpes ou gaufres, c'est une bonne adresse dans le quartier."}
{"text":"Découvert ce lieu grâce à Urbanspoon ! Vraiment bien, beaucoup de choix, crêpes délicieuses et surtout meilleur que Juliette & Chocolat !"}
{"text":"Great dessert. Don't expect fast service but nice and worth the wait. Late night spot to check out and they have places all over the city"}
{"text":"We had very good espresso and hot cacao here. Improvement needs to be made on cleanliness since it's a sugary establishment; too many fruit flies, tables and chairs are sticky."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very different from the one on St-Catherine in several ways and personally I prefer the latter. Loft style and spacious, but the noise and smell of the machinery were quite disturbing. The food is a bit disappointing but it's still fine chocolate dessert."}
{"text":"I almost always order the same dish at Cacao70 because it's simply unbeatable: cheese cake pancake with strawberry and chocolate dip as well as ice-cream on the side. The other dishes that I tried were too sweet and have no particularities that really wow me. Lineups can be quite intense so choose your visit time wisely :)"}
{"text":"I passed by this place while I was at the Christmas market this year and decided to check it out. I liked the ambiance and decor of the place. Its a cute place to go for a date or girls night. And who doesn't like the idea of getting a cup of hot chocolate during this cold and festive time of year?   The chocolate fondue I ordered was really good. The chocolate was really rich and smooth. I ordered the single size to share with one other person and we still couldn't finish it 'cause it got really sweet (I like sweets, but don't have a crazy sweet tooth). Don't let them convince you to get the double size for two people. Single is just right for two. We also ordered a cup of hot chocolate to share and it was the best hot chocolate I've ever tasted.   Although the desserts and drinks were good, the service was REALLY slow. It was a weekday when I went, it was busy but not crazy busy. They're definitely understaffed. When we walked in the door, no one acknowledged us. They made eye contact but would look away and do other things. We finally got seated, and again took a while for the server to come. We'd tried to get his attention several times, but again he'll look at us, look away and do other things. This happened each time we needed something (water, order, bill). Since I was sitting by the door, I noticed they wouldn't really acknowledge other guests walking in either. It was also really cold sitting by the door each time the door opened.   Overall, it's definitely a place to check out while at the Christmas market and for some good chocolate, but don't expect good service."}
{"text":"Loved the decor and atmosphere. Lovely patio and nice calm music. Even though we did not sit at the patio, as it was too hot outside, we got the best brunch experience. I got the Italian sausage Fritatta that came in a heavy sizzling pan. My bofriend had the meatlover Fritatta, which was equally delicious (his option came with potatoes, which were to die for). His Fritatta was served on the plate and was easier for him to eat. The food came with slices of strawberries, banana, and pine apples and a chocolate dip (tasted like M&M's  milk chocolate to me). The only thing I was not satisfied with was a the service. It was super slow and the waiter was very nervous and agitated."}
{"text":"The absolut  chocohilic meeting place! If you think you know everything about chocolate and how you can have it, think again!! Vast menu, more than 30 variety of chocolate, crepes, waffles...brunch, lunch, dinner, snacks...chocolate, chocolate, chocolate!!! Beautiful decor, cool ambiance, very good staff. Don't wait! Doctors say that chocolate is good for you, so...go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here twice now, if you have a chocolate waffle craving topped ice-cream and fresh fruits in a decent atmosphere, then this is the place to visit! It is definitely really sweet, so I wouldn't come here often for the sake of my health. But it was an enjoyable experience because you can dip fruits into chocolate fondue, yummy!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for snack or dessert... Great variety. Chocolate quality is good. Waffles are great. A delicious treat... And very well presented.   Prices are reasonable considering the amount of chocolate they give you.   A few things to improve: the wafers in our plate were really stale. The brownie is too dense and too sweet to be enjoyable  Waitresses were very nice."}
{"text":"Cacao 70 is definitely a place you should check out if you're a dessert lover. A friend of mine had been dying to get her hands on some good dessert so we figured this was the place to go.   The menu is massive, yet there aren't many options for those with restrictions, allergies, etc. My only option was basically fruit and dark chocolate, which I did enjoy, but it's hard to get that wrong. Although I will admit that the portion of fruit was tiny. With that said, my friend seemed to enjoy what she ordered. Another thing I noticed was that it was extremely hot in the restaurant to the point where it made you feel uncomfortable - not fun. The service was relatively quick, and our waiter was very nice. It took them awhile to clear the tables when customers had finished, but the rest of the restaurant seemed clean.   This is a great place to go if you have a sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Wanna get stuffed with chocolate (and/or sugar in general)? This is the place! Just upon entering the sweet chocolate scent hits you in the face. Come early in the afternoon or morning, since it can get pretty busy in the evenings (the place is rather small and craving a sugar hit, you won't want to wait).  The menu is long, actually a bit too long if you ask me. It's very difficult to decide, unless you wanna come every day and try something different. Well, that was not the case here since we were in town only for a little while. If you are a party of at least two or three people, it's worth ordering an assortment of several things - Sweet Chocolate Experience or Sharing for Two or More, that way you get to try more and share instead of getting too stuffed by yourself.  We ordered a Triple Chocolate Cake (kinda resembles Tiramisu), something we should have shared, cause it's too much for one person - too much chocolate in one go (if there is such a thing, you'll say... and there is!). Black and White Waffle - a huge portion of waffles, chocolate, ice cream and whipped cream (also a lot for one person), Hot Chocolate and a Strawberry White Chocolate Shake (a small one). A lot (too much) for one evening if you ask me. Everything was tasty, but tolling on our stomachs.  Next evening we tried Strawberry and Cheesecake Crepe (the best decision I've made here), Tuna Sandwich with a side salad, Chicken Sandwich without sides and a Brazilian Coffee. Sandwiches were nothing special - too much bread and too little contents (in the end it's a chocolate place, not a sandwich place, sometimes I forget about these things). The crepe was a proper one and I would have ordered it again if ever in town.   All in all a good dessert place, but try to hold yourself back a bit when ordering. Even if you're super hungry, you might get stuffed all too fast, so rather share and order twice, if needed. :)  Staff is super helpful and they speak English - also the menu comes in English as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely everything is delicious. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because it's fairly slow, but if you're not in a rush, this is the best dessert place ever!"}
{"text":"A nice modern coffee house right in the middle of the vintage district  of Toronto. Nice place, with friendly stuff. we tried a couple of chocolates and a triple chocolate cake. all of them were delicious.  overall I would say it is worth stopping on a cold/rainy day."}
{"text":"Cacao 70 is not cheap, they are charging the same pricing at every single location across Canada. I had been to their Montreal location years ago so I know what to expect.  This Distillery location though is more basic and one might wonder why this price point?!   America Style Hot Chocolate ($5.25) is good size for a small. The flavour is rich and tasted like a liquid dessert.   There was no wait at all when we dropped by in the late afternoon. I doubt I would have waited and pay a premium for a hot chocolate."}
{"text":"omg super cute cafe with Good coffee and bakeries ans delicious chocolates........ morden docor and cozy environment"}
{"text":"This is a delightful place, especially for brunch! Our server was very knowledgable about the menu, and was appropriately able to recommend items to us. The portions are large, but not immense. The melted chocolate with fruit is delicious. So are their waffles, and smoked salmon ciabatta sandwich. Service was rather quick and the ambiance is relatively vibrant. The only thing was that the manager on duty (doubling as a host) was a bit inattentive (took ten minutes to seat us (there were tons of tables available, but one has to wait to be seated), primarily because he was engaged in conversation with someone instead of manning the host area) and had a severe scowl on his face (so I hope he was just having a bad day). Otherwise, great place to go!"}
{"text":"Wow, a few of us came upon the place looking for a dessert place after dinner in Chinatown.  Perfect spot!  Busy with lots of people by there's quite a bit of seating.   Menu is large and chocolate options go on and on and on.  The smell in here is Intoxicatedng in all good ways.  We tried a waffle dish and a crepe dish and shared at our table... Delicious!  Friendly staff and pretty fast service for a pretty packed night.  Great find !"}
{"text":"If you want a cozy, warm and comfortable place to have breakfast/brunch, this place is a place to go for. The servers were very knowledgeable and knew a lot about the menu. The server that we had memorized our entire menu. I know especially as a former server that in order to do that is very difficult. The waitress offered here recommendations of the food and knew what the restaurant didn't have. The food came out quickly. I ordered the vegetarian crepe pressed sandwich. Very fluffy on the inside with spinach and egg whites and feta cheese and a nice crust from the outside crepe. Very tasty. It came with a generous portion of house salad. Good quality meal at a quality price with great service, what more can you ask for? The next time I come back to Toronto, I'll be sure to eat here again. I'm looking forward to trying more on their menu."}
{"text":"Great dessert place with plenty of options. Nice environment and good service. Ordered the banana split,  really tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"this place was popping on a sat night! we had nothing else to do so we decided to wait and grab some dessert after dinner.  about 15 mins later, they had a table ready for us.  the menu has so many choices! it reminded me of max brenner! .. basically just like it haha.  we ordered an apple crepe and a frozen hot chocolate.  everything was just as expected~ really hit the spot since we were craving dessert for that sweet finish.  i like it that the crepe and the cinnamon apples weren't too sweet.  crepe was nice n thin~ warm and refreshing.. very comforting on a cold winter day in canada!  the frozen hot chocolate was nice, the chocolate was much heavier that i thought.. then again, i always underestimate how filling chocolate can be! haha   overall, it's a really relaxing hangout spot! i wish i have something like it around where i live.. something that isn't extremely overpriced like max brenner.. the dessert was nothing spectacular but i guess the company you're with is what's most important :)"}
{"text":"Décoration et environnement chaleureux lors d'une journée d'hiver. La carte des brunchs est variée et le gout est au rendez vous. Les prix sont très raisonnables."}
{"text":"love it dont know why this one is rated less high than the others, i like there strawbery shortcake parfait, chocolate drinks but dont like the pizza with marshmello its just too much."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch during the week. I was only customer at 11am. Ceiling Lights next to my table were broken, flickered like a strobe light the whole time, but it matched the house/trance music that was playing at 11am on a Tuesday. Service was friendly, fast and knowledgeable about the menu. Told me about specials and offered recommendations. I hear it's a great dessert place but the chocolates menu wasn't explained at all-- probably wrong time of day? But she gave me the chocolates menu anyway. Food was 6/10, I had a breakfast chorizo sandwich. Nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"I was craving dessert, and heard about this cafe. So happy we decided to try it out!! The dessert was so good, also the portions are huge. If you know you can't finish one plate to yourself, share it.   4 stars because the service was slow, and the wait time was somewhat long. This place also has higher prices for dessert, but you do get what you pay for (huge portions). However, if I'm back in the area, I would def. come back to try something new."}
{"text":"Oh chocolat! J'aimerais tellement ça que le chocolat ait sa propre catégorie dans le guide alimentaire et qu'on me recommande d'en manger 3 à 4 fois par jour! Avec un charmant café comme Cacao 70, je pourrais même changer de sorte de chocolat des centaines de fois avant de reprendre la même chose! Suis-je la seule à rêver comme ça?  Je suis allée au Cacao 70 à la suite d'une grande marche au froid dans le Parc Mont-Royal avec Laura D qui avait écrit un avis qui me faisait saliver à en lire ses mots. C'est le stop parfait pour un des meilleurs chocolats chauds de votre vie pendant les journées froides d'hiver. La motivation parfaite pour prendre de l'air en plein janvier! J'y ai aussi pris une gaufre nature que j'ai eu le plaisir de tremper dans mon chocolat.  Ma seule critique était que parce qu'ils avaient 3 grands groupe vu que c'était en pleine heure du brunch, ils n'était pas bien coordonner pour nous emmener nos choses et le service était lent. 15 minutes pour passer notre commande, 15 minutes pour le chocolat chaud puis au moins 30 minutes si pas plus avant qu'on leur demande si nos plats viendraient. Et pour la facture, c'était un peu la même chose aussi. J'y retournerai donc, mais probablement à un autre moment comme en après-midi ou en pleine semaine."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a post date sweet snack!  My boyfriend & I stopped in here late one evening and were incredibly impressed.   The environment is welcoming & cozy. Though we sat & weren't greeted for around 10 minutes, we enjoyed looking around at each tables tasty treats. We had the platter for two which included chocolate fondue that was absolutely to die for!  I'd highly suggest visiting here - especially if you're a chocolate lover. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great decor and all the food is good. I went here like three times in 4 days."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I originally came to go to L'Avenue, as I had been there before and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Unfortunately, the line was around the block, so we decided to go here instead, as they advertised a brunch menu. What a disaster!  To state upfront - the food here is good. It's not the best I've ever had, and it's not as good as they make it seem, but it's definitely good. However, I would rather have food significantly worse if it came out in under an hour! The wait times here were absolutely ridiculous, to the point where I almost got up and left. Me and my partner waiting an hour and a half from ordering just to get our food - which was just a crepe with chocolate and strawberries! I was super disappointed. Though I might eventually try another Cacao 70 location, I doubt I'll ever be back to this one. Just wait for L'Avenue!"}
{"text":"Cacao 70 is a place that popped up on Queen St West for the past few months. I know there's another location near Distillery but it's rare for me to head in that direction so I'm glad that this popped up.   My friend and I came here after a late dinner on a Friday night (11pm). There were maybe 5-6 tables occupied at this time.  The interior is well lit, cozy and well decorated. We were helped to water and menus right when we walked in. My friend and I  decided to split the Choco Nut Waffle.   It took approximately 10 minute before we were greeted by a beautiful plated waffle with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, strawberries, bananas, hazelnut, and of course - a plate of melted chocolate (the store is named for its extensive chocolate selection). The waffle itself was average (you could upgrade your waffle - maybe I should have) - but I really enjoyed the ice cream. The fruits were fresh as well. The chocolate was delicious and if you drizzle it on the ice cream, the melted chocolate would solidify.   Overall, I enjoyed my dessert experience and would consider coming back. It's a cute place for desserts but it's definitely a bit on the expensive end."}
{"text":"If you are a chocolate addict then this is the place for you!!!!  From drinks to pizza they have it all and different kinds as well.  You can use milk , semi sweet or dark chocolate when you order drinks or dessert.    Decor is cute and the people are super nice and friendly.  They also have fondue to share if you don't feel like having too much chocolate.   Great place to chill and fill your chocolate cravings."}
{"text":"One word: SWEET!!!  Chocolate here, chocolate there. I took the Sweet Chocolate Experience for Two with my girlfriend and it was a lot for both of us! If you're craving chocolate, go here and you'll get out of it feeling accomplished. Prices are reasonable, very kind service. No regrets because chocolate is always worth it! The hot chocolate is wow, chocolate, you can feel the chocolate run down your throat and you can feel the aroma all the way down, while making you drool."}
{"text":"Is this place heaven? I think so.  Too bad I don't live in Montreal. This will be the first place I visit on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Very small portion for the double classic fondue! We didn't have enough chocolate to finish our fruits or our waffles! Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I really don't like this waitress there. This blonde short one skinny one always has her hair in a bun anyways, I don't remember her name but she's very stuck up, snarky, and doesn't know how to serve properly. This is the second time i've had her. The first time was my friend, and my boyfriend and I were outside and it was 10:00. We waited for so long for her. FIRST OFF! When you get a customer in the serving business YOU are suppose to bring them water, check up on them to see how long they need with the menu. INSTEAD i took it upon myself to be rude and return the menus back and told her we are LEAVING! and told her she was the WORST waitress I've ever had. Last night was my 2nd time. She was so rude and ask if we are taking things out, NO we aren't we are coming in for Fondue! FINALLY she actually did a good thing was to bring us water, and our food but seriously i don't like her attitude and the way she talks she seems very FAKE!!! legit she's lucky she got a tip last night... Or did something \"nice\" or i'd give it to her or next time i'll snap my fingers and tell her whats up....  First time she really put a curse on is thats for sure! *Corna*"}
{"text":"Most popular for its fondues but we had a smoke salmon bagel and a strawberry and goat cheese salad instead. The food were delicious but the portion is quite disappointing. The mint tea was fresh but the Americocoa (cocoa powder with chocolate chunks) was not as good as expected. Overall I will say a 7.2/10."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a little cozy restaurant with a nice, clean interior. I like the \"cabin\" look of the place. The lineups get really long so I suggest making a reservations (if you have the chance) or come at quiet hours.  FOOD: The food is pretty good. The first time I came here, I got the sharing sharing plate. If you're REALLY into sweets and are two, this is the plate for you. For me, it got way too sweet at one point. Me and my partner couldn't finish it... And we were two. The second time, I got just a smaller sharing plate. I would suggest getting the dark chocolate as the dipping option because it's easier to not feel overwhelmed by the sugar.  PRICE: Yes, it's kind of overpriced but I think you're paying more for the service, the location and the \"type\" of restaurant this is. Nice place for a date, Valentines day or just a nice hangout place.  SERVICE: The service is good. Staff are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The service at this establishment is really, really poor. I was embarrassed to be with my friends, many of whom are new to Montreal and to have them treated so poorly. The food is moderately good, although I do not think that it is worth the long waiting times in line, the price."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place in the Queen Street area. For chocolate lovers, you're bound to find something on the menu that you'd like.  There are many seating areas, which is a plus compared to many crowded coffee shops in the area, where seating becomes very scarce on weekends.  I tried the mocha, which was very rich, chocolatey and creamy. I would want to come back to this place to try some of their dessert items."}
{"text":"This is where chocolate dreams are made of. It's a large open concept space that's cool for a date or with friends. There's free wifi which is a nice touch and I can definitely see myself coming here to potentially get some work done."}
{"text":"Sooo good!! My first time trying this place because I'm currently visiting Montreal! I recommend this place to anyone who has a sweet tooth! If your don't have a sweet tooth you should probably share a plate"}
{"text":"The chocolate fondue was so delicious, just wish they gave more waffles and brownies to dip it in. Even though the brownie wasn't stiff enough to stay on the fondue stick it was delicious! My friend ordered the cappucino which she had to add alot of sugar as it wasn't sweet at all. Definetely will go back and try some other items!! Great for chocolate lovers!"}
{"text":"Three words: Bring your date!   My fiance and I really love this place that we came 4 days in a row. It was a bit excessive but we ordered the same plate every time, the Choconut Waffles which was delicious. It comes with strawberries, toffee bananas and chocolate to dip. The waffle itself has whipped cream and a scoop of ice cream which came to $18 before tip. The server is extremely friendly and the offer chilled water in a water bottle for every guest.   If you're looking for a place to WOW, this is the place! I can't wait to go back and try some dark chocolate!"}
{"text":"We came here on a trip to Toronto recently, and stopped by on a cold afternoon. I ordered the hot chocolate because I was intrigued by the artistic presentation. My husband ordered the mocha and cheesecake. The hot chocolate was WAY too heavy and sweet. It seemed almost like fondue chocolate that I was drinking, so after three sips, I couldn't stomach it anymore (and I normally love myself some chocolate!). The cheesecake was delectable though! Very light and just the right amount of sweetness. The mocha was the drink I should have ordered because it was smooth and delicious."}
{"text":"On our trip to Montreal, my friend and I bookmarked this place for a sweet dessert experience. We had dinner and then gave ourselves a couple of hours of museum time before heading here for our lovely chocolate experience for 2.   I am a chocolate fiend so I was very excited to come here in general and the atmosphere didn't disappoint. We were brought a bucket of marshmallow roasting supplies and waited for our plate. I took issue with a couple of things right off the bat. First, I know it comes with one milkshake, which as an experience for two is kind of lame, but this isn't a beautiful tall shake. It comes in a short tumbler and it's basically a tasting portion. That being said, it's one of the best milkshakes I've ever had.  The other thing was that we were supposed to get strawberries and bananas, as per the menu, but we got pineapple in lieu of strawberries. It was fine because I love pineapples but it would have been nice to have been warned about the substitution.  The waffle tasted a little weird and my friend pointed out that it was a little undercooked in the middle. We didn't really touch it. The grill for the marshmallows runs out so after that, play time is over. The dipping sauce was great and the crunchy wafer balls were as well. I saw a couple of other delicious chocolatey concoctions at other tables so I'd return to try those. But it's a lot of dessert even for two people."}
{"text":"Bouffe - La pizza dessert au nutella est complètement démente ! Servi avec des morceaux de banane et de fraise. La pâte est croustillante et penche légèrement vers le salé, ce qui donne un petit duo sucré salé. Leur sélection de chocolat est impressionnante et très bonne. On vous offre le choix des pastilles de chocolat et le liquide chaud à verser, soit amer, mi- amère, et au lait. Pour les indécis, l'option vous est offerte de choisir des chocolats chauds prédéterminés.   Service - charmant ! La serveuse était très charmante et serviable. Voyant qu'on hésitait dans nos choix de chocolat, elle nous a apporté plusieurs pastilles afin que l'on puisse y goûter.   Ambiance - Un mélange de rustique et de moderne. Très éclairé, parfait pour conclure une petite soirée ou se réchauffer quelques instants."}
{"text":"I only came here because I was on a time crunch and couldn't wait in line for the better brunch across the street. I should've waited in line. Obviously this place specializes in chocolate and not food, that was pretty evident after my first bite.   My family ordered 2 omelettes and a savory crepe. The omelettes were bland; I didn't know you could mess up eggs that horribly. The crepe was equally lacking in flavor. They should keep salt and pepper on the table if they keep the current chef. I should've ordered some chocolate to drizzle all over my breakfast m, at least that would've given the food some flavor.   Come here for the chocolate not for the food. The service was friendly,  but was slow because of understaffing."}
{"text":"If you have a major sweet tooth then this place would def be heaven for you, except of course, the painstakingly sloooowwww service.  Walked inside the place (pretty roomy at the back btw) and was standing there waiting to be greeted while checking to see if my friends were already there. In the time that I reached my friend and found where she sat, I was not greeted by anyone at all, when a server fully stared at me as I was opening the door, thanks dude!  Anyway, brunch is served 10-4pm which is a pretty big window of time which is pretty sweet (no pun intended) and it was actually possible to make reservations which was also a plus (though was odd that they never took down my number for the reso). During the entire time I was there (which was Sunday during lunch hour), I didn't see a wait at all for a table.  Tons of options on the menu to satisfy your sweet tooth, placed an order for the Intense Black and White Chocolate Crepe Roll and my gosh... my fresh fruits (which were part of my crepe order) was the first thing to arrive at our table and it just sat there for half hour. Half hour later, all of the crepes my friends and I ordered finally arrived. I honestly didn't understand why they brought my fruits to me if the rest of my plate wasn't ready?!   Ok about the food... nothing special, tasted like your regular chocolate covered crepes, although it was a bit crispier than other places I've been to. Overall, nothing really special - might consider coming back if I'm having a late night sweet craving!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutly delicious ! If you like desert and chocolate this is the place for you. I took the black and white chocolate fondue with fruits and brownies. Just to think about it and i want to go back again !"}
{"text":"Good place, the location is convenient for me cause it's close to where I live.. but it's not my favourite desert place in MTL.. I don't like the taste of the chocolate that they use to be honest.. Their sandwiches are OK, noting special either."}
{"text":"Since this is a super convenient location for me, I've been here a couple of times.   The first few times were pretty great. However, the past few times I've been have been very dissapointing. In fact, the past few times were 1 star experiences, but overall I'll leave it at a 2.   The first incident was on Valentine's day. It was busy, and the place was very obviously understaffed. The two or three people who were working were running all over the place and seemed very irritated. My boyfriend and I got the Earl Grey fondue that we've had previously. The pieces of waffles we got were just plain sad. They weren't even cooked! It was dense, half raw dough. We tried to at the attention of a staff member, but they constantly rushed past is without stopping. When we finally got their attention, they were able to rectify the situation by giving us properly cooked pieces of waffle.   The second incident happened on my birthday. We headed over there around 8pm for a birthday dessert. The place wasn't busy at all. We were seated and waited roughly 10minutes to place our order and even longer to get water. While waiting for the triple chocolate pizza, we noticed that the table next to us was vacant, but still hadn't been cleared. It ended up taking more than 30min before they cleared that table! When our pizza finally came, it was a extremely dissapointing. It's a tiny portion of dough (that tastes like bread, but has a doughy texture) topped with some chocolate powder and pieces. There was very little chocolate and it wasn't even melted. To me, it looked like someone sprinkled some hot chocolate powder on a piece of naan bread. It came with some bananas, strawberries and a chocolate sauce on the side to dip. After we finished the very dissapointing meal, we were asked to go to the counter to pay. The waiter/busboy/cashier seemed very exasperated when we showed him a discount card, because he couldn't figure out how to input the discount. The food, the attitude and the overall rushed feeling we got from the staff made this a horrible experience.   We'll probably stick to bubble tea for a while and give this place a break"}
{"text":"Chocolate heaven! I went twice during my recent visit to Montreal. The waffles and crepes are a must! Also their selection of coffee and hot chocolates are amazing!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with some friends and it was a nice spot with big open windows and friendly servers. I had the blue mushroom omelette which came with a small portion of fruits and chocolate fondue as do some other items on the brunch menu. Their chocolate is pretty good and they give a variety of different fruits. The portions are pretty generous too. My meal came with the omelette, 3 slices of bread and potatoes. It was good for the location and what we paid but the food isn't super unique."}
{"text":"So much fun... Their menu was a chocolate bible. Service was great. We tried a crepe, fondue, and a fancy hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was super sweet so is suggest to order it with hot milk on the side maybe? Overall will definitely return to try more."}
{"text":"My God this place is amazing. As good, if not better than Juliette et Chocolat. I really love the fondue set and the molten chocolate drinks. All the 70%+ ones are great.  Definitely a must visit every time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Juliette et chocolat est trop plein?!? Qu'à cela ne se tienne! Dirigez vous sur Ste-Catherine pour essayer Cacao 70 à la place!  Personellement, je préfère le Cacao 70! Une des raisons, leur chocolat chaud: le serveur peut t'aider à choisir ton chocolat en t'apportant des pastilles pour gouter le chocolat lui même. Ensuite le chocolat est fondu dans un verre et dans l'autre, la base choisie (au lait, mi-sucré, amer).  Avec la base d'un bord et le chocolat fondu de l'autre, on peut choisir la consistance désirée de notre chocolat chaud! Ingénieux!  Ensuite, leur pizza au chocolat!!! Mmmmmm! La croûte ressemble réallement à celle d'une pizza mais légèrement sucrée.  Servie sur une planche en marbre avec soit des fruits, des guimauves et d'autre chocolat fondu (!), la pizza est croquante sous la dent, et tendre à l'intérieur.... J'ai essayé celle au chocolat et ricotta et celle à la guimauve grillée! Wow! Et si vous vous sentez coupable d'ingurgiter autant de calories, prenez la demi-portion!  Les fondues sont accompagnées de brownies, gaufres et fruits dépendamment de la sorte que vous choisissez.  Celle aux Turtles est folle! et pas trop sucrée étonnamment!  Bref, je vous conseille fortement de prendre soit le chocolat chaud OU un dessert. Sinon, je vous aurais averti ;) Vous serez prêt à roulez sur vous même à votre retour tellement vous allez être pleins... mais oh combien satisfait :)"}
{"text":"Nice little chocolate haven!! I think they can do better at highening the aroma of chocolate even more =P  Enjoyed a little sexy chocolate drink in a margarita glass.... Soooo good!!"}
{"text":"Yummy fondu au chocolat servi avec fruits, brownie et gaufrette pour 9,50$ qu'on peut facilement partager à deux mais les frappés too small and too expensif !!"}
{"text":"Hot chocolate 7 ways to die, and more.  Cold Chocolate, chocolate fondue, waffles and more.  Ice cream galore. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"even on a busy night & made-to-order menu items.. the food arrives to your table in such an awesome timely manner it's amazing... BECAUSSEEEE ... the desserts are so delicious! even just reading through the menu makes you drool. i've had the pleasure of indulging in the Choco-Nut Waffle on two different occasions while on vacation in Montreal earlier this month. the batter of the waffle is something i've never tasted here back in the states & it's a flavor i will continue to crave until i find my way back to canada. fluffy, warm, & tasty complete with that made-from-scratch touch. items are pretty pricey here, but everything in canada is expensive. luckily the price is completely justified in the quality of food. service is wonderful & you gotta love when a cafe is all hipstered out perfect for your instagram pix lol. love this place, 5 stars no doubt."}
{"text":"A menu filled with a huge variety of chocolatey desserts?! Insert heart eyed emoji here!!! Cacao 70 is bound to fill your sweet craving and their large menu will leave you feeling quite indecisive! I went with their dark hot chocolate. Simple but delicious! I can't wait to go back and try more like those milkshakes!!! The service was friendly, the environment was good and the aroma mmmmmm if my condo smelt like that I'd be in trouble!!"}
{"text":"Super assiette de brunch, omelette savoureuse et garnie, les muffins sont également très bons. Sans oublier le très sympathique serveur.  Merci et bravo"}
{"text":"I love the decor. The atmosphere of eating chocolate and watching the snow storm outside its huge windows is 5 stars!!!! The service we had that day was very good.  Here it is more American menu options than Juliet et Chocolat. Lots of ice cream!!!!  So badly craved the Black and White after seeing the pictures and I was NOT disappointed. Super good! Two scoops of ice cream with hardened chocolate drizzle on top, plus crispy chocolate dots for dipping. The waffle was great but thick! I like.  Anyways it's 3 stars because they refused to refund my friend's $100 tip (this happened a while ago). Clearly a mistake! How dare they argue? It took 30 minutes to finally have them refund it. I think that's ridiculous."}
{"text":"A bright and open space. Was there around 10pm and it was still packed (maybe also because of the light festival). Our friends recommended this place and the hot chocolate was melted from real chocolate. It was the most rich thing I've ever tasted. The texture was wonderful. I got a small American hot chocolate, dark, since I don't like super sweet taste (there's also the option of semi sweet and milk chocolate). There are also many other options. Will come back to try the chocolate fondue that looks really fun"}
{"text":"Vraiment excellent. Les prix sont très bien pour la grande quantité des assiettes. Offre des déjeuners et dîner mais surtout des excellent desserts.  Nous y sommes allées pour le dessert. Une portion individuel (quart) de pizza choco-guimauve servit avec fraise vraiment excellente et fraîche, banane tout aussi bonne et chocolat fondu. Un régale.  Comme autre dessert, un parfait quadruple chocolat servit avec deux boules de crèmes glacer, coulis chocolat, morceau de chocolat, sauce chocolat et brownies chocolat.  Ressemble à Juliette et chocolat, Mais avec un service meilleur (malgré un peu absent), Mais beaucoup moins cher avec de meilleur portion.  Possibilité de faire des remplacement dans le menu comme changer le chocolat (noir, blanc ou au lait), les saveur de crème glacé (chocolat, vanille, menthe chocolat) Ou d'enlever certains éléments que vous n'aimez pas.  Aussi plusieurs chocolat chaud (Au lait et noir de 8% à plus de 80%).  J'y retournerai c'est sur. Pour moi, pour un dessert qui remplis sans me faire éclater, C'est mon endroit."}
{"text":"A great place to get your chocolate fix in. This location is located downtown right near McGill! They have an extensive menu full of delicious details like caramelized bananas and gourmet chocolate sprinkle balls. They offer waffles, crepes, savory things,  fondues, milkshakes, ice cream dishes, and more. It is a lot of fun and I will definitely be going back more. (Already been back once.)"}
{"text":"This place was a great alternative to my normal Montreal chocolate-centric restaurant which is Juliette et Chocolat. I honestly over did it on the chocolate here but every bit of it was worth it.  My meal consisted of a waffle (very sweet, though i wish it wasn't candyish flavored) topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and chocolate fudge drizzle and white chocolate drizzle.  This included a side of warm milk and white chocolate to dip my ice cream of waffle in, if the drizzle was not enough, with an additional few grams of  milk chocolate ball toppings (I'm sure that there's some much more eloquent name for them).  The meal was very rich to say the least.  I OD'd on sugar and chocolate.  I only wish that the waffle wasn't ridiculously sweet and that one of the female waitresses wasn't  so non-attentive and nonchalant.  Overall good experience for a busy late evening snack though."}
{"text":"We went there on a weekday and they did give us a pretty spacious table for my friend and I with 2 strollers. We all ordered hot chocolates as recommended by another friend, and I ordered the sesame hot cocoa. We wound up waiting for 45 minutes, finding out that they still had no made our hot chocolates yet, and we were hoping to walk around the Distillery right after drinking our hot chocolate. We wound up going up to the counter to take it to go and they were just making it as we were leaving the place. So it was quite disappointing in terms of the service we received and how long it took them to give us our drinks.  In terms of the hot cocoa though, it was really good. I ordered a sesame one and I liked the combination with cocoa, it wasn't too sweet and the milk was frothed with it, which made it very delicious. It was definitely very good quality hot cocoa with very fresh ingredients, a bit expensive as are all things at the Distillery but I did enjoy it. I think that if the service was better, we would have enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very casual and relaxing. A plus that you are able to charge your devices here. So many sweet items to choose from, but I went with nutella pizza. It came with a side bowl of strawberries, bananas, and milk chocolate. Yum! If you are a chocolate lover, this is the place to be. Service was indifferent, but as long as i got my food taken care of, i'm satisfied."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for brunch and once for desserts. I think desserts are much better here.  Food: the dessert options are great. I recommend the sets for two that they offer, I think they're a great sampling set. The brunch I thought was less impressive and would recommend instead having the sweets menu rather than the savory if here for brunch.  Service/Price: not much to be said here, pretty timely service and reasonable prices.  Ambiance: dead in the morning it seems, but I had a good time when it was fairly busy around the afternoon. I enjoy the music and energy here around those hours."}
