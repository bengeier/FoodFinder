{"text":"The food that we got was mostly cold. The coleslaw was sitting on the counter on ice uncovered. The  employee in the back making the food was texting on his phone the whole time in plain view. Was very disappointed."}
{"text":"The fish itself is what saved this restaurant from a one star review. Other than that, YUCK! The nacho like cheese dumped haphazardly on one side of the sandwich is in my \"worst-of\" fast food highlights. The marinara for mozzerella sticks is on point though."}
{"text":"This was really a delicious place to eat !  My husband ordered the fish and chips dinner and it was absolutely wonderful.  There was a man outside cooking bar-be-que so I opted for the pulled pork sandwich and potato salad.  Can't tell you how very good it all was!  Friendly people and great service.  We will definitely will be back and we came from Lakewood to try this place.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it should have been spotless and it wasn't.  Please people clean the floors and tables and especially wash the windows, don't wait one more day.  You have a great customer base and we all deserve a clean Arthur Treachers."}
{"text":"While the food was okay, typical for an Arthur Treacher's, the decor and the service left much to be desired.  

The place is in dire need of a complete remodel.  Looks like nothing has been done on the exterior or interior in many, many years.  Not very inviting.

That aside, the service level also needs a bit of improvement.  I ordered two dinners to go.  After waiting about 3 or 4 minutes for the shrimp and clams to be cooked, I was informed that they didn't have the fish and would have to cook some.  So it took another 5 minutes or so for those to cook.  Meanwhile, the shrimp and clams were left under the heating lamps.  And there were four people working there and none of them seemed to have any sense of urgency.  In fact, the cashier was eating fries and all four of them were chit chatting and laughing like they were at some event.  After the one lady, who appeared to be in charge, noticed that I was getting annoyed, she said it would be three more minutes.  She did offer me a free drink.  I didn't want the drink.  I just wanted the food to be prepared in a timely manner, which it definitely was not.

Just not good customer service.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"It looks like you've walked into \"That 70's Show\", but I will say...I had their fish sandwich and it was one of the tastiest fish sandwiches I had at a fast food joint!"}
{"text":"Like most Arthur Treachers locations, this one is at least 10 years over due for a remodel. However, I had a really good lunch here today. The fish, fries, and hush puppy were all fried lightly and were really tasty. The staff was friendly as well."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  This palace takes me back to my childhood when there were Arthur Treacher's all around North East Ohio.  Now there is only one left in the Cleveland area and this is the one.

I have come here a few times since discovering this location.  I have ordered the fish, fries, hush puppies, clam strips, battered shrimp and battered chicken. The battered fish is my favorite.  The fish is light and flakey with a nice thick crispy batter skin.  Dip it in their tartar sauce and you have something special there.  The battered chicken pieces were super tasty.  The clam strips with the cocktail sauce was a nice appetizer.  All had the same classic taste like the last time I had it years ago.

The portions seem a little smaller than I remember but I guess that's the way of things now.  I come here for the fried fish and chicken.  If that is not your kind of thing, they have gyros too!"}
{"text":"I saw an article in Cleveland.com about Arthur Treacher's and that there was a nearby location that is still open for business. I texted my mother, who took me to Arthur Treacher's when I was a kid, to see if she wanted to go for dinner. She said she wanted to go so off we went. I took my kids too because my son loves chicken tenders.

We ordered hush puppies, chicken, fish, and fries. The chicken was delicious, especially when dipped in the cocktail sauce, which I love. It was every bit as good as I remember. The fish was good too. The fries were just okay, but they've always been just okay. The hush puppies were also just as good as I remember, but I can only eat one or two of those.

Eating here definitely brought back fond memories of childhood. Unfortunately, everything is deep fried, but that is also what makes it so good. The batter is just awesome. It's crunchy and it tastes good. I don't always eat the breading of deep fried foods, but this batter is so good that I ate every bit of it. Yummy crunchy!

I'll stop in now and then for the yummy chicken and cocktail sauce."}
{"text":"Arthur Treacher's is sadly one of the only decent, dedicated fish n chips shops in Cleveland.  If there are others besides the abominable Long John Silver's, please send me a note.

The fish is good and the chicken is really awesome.  This place serves my favorite breaded chicken.  When dipped in the cocktail sauce, the chicken is freaking tasty.

The batter here is what makes a piece of fish a piece of fish.  The batter is delectable and it's always cooked right.

When you're in the mood for a plate of greasy fries, yummy hushpuppies, crispy fish, or tasty chicken, go to Arthur Treacher's."}
{"text":"This is the last one i visited. I've been to the Independence and Euclid locations as well. The fish is flaky and crispy, but lacks that special spice that Long John's uses. The hush puppies and chips are about even with LJS. The advantage over the other guys? No adjoining Taco Bell, which turns my stomach. But they don't have a bell to ring on the way out. I just say cheerie-oh and tip my bowler hat."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to an Arthur Treacher's in years, but after reading an article at cleveland.com on Arthur Treacher's I decided to check it out again. The location could use a serious remodel. It was Good Friday, and I was in the mood for fried fish. I was not alone. The line was almost out the door, and business was non-stop. The fish was absolutely delicious - nice and crisp crust and moist flaky fish inside. The chips were good, and the malt vinegar on the tables was a nice touch. The cole slaw was perfect and is probably the cole slaw I remember from my child and measure all other cole slaw against, only for them to come up lacking. I was happy I ordered it. The only thing I didn't like was the seafood chowder. It tasted off and somewhat metallic. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great fish and everything else, and outstanding service.  I've been here often and will continue to come."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  This will be a somewhat biased review because I absolutely LOVE Arthur Treacher's fish.  And I'm completely swimming in nostalgia...

I had noticed over the last few years that all of the AT locations that I knew about had disappeared.  I assumed they were all gone and felt guilty that I hadn't frequented them enough to help keep them going.  A few months ago an article appeared talking about this particular location.  After putting it off (for what reasons, I'm not sure) for too long, my mom and I made the short trip to this Arthur Treacher's.  I think that I had visited here years ago because I remember the building.  When we walked in, we were flooded with memories, especially because I know that the older gentleman (owner?) working there worked at either the Euclid or Mayfield location previously.

The place is definitely dated and not the absolute cleanest (though I think they're doing the best they can with the constant frying of DELICIOUS fish).  The food was perfect.  Perfect flavor and the exact taste as it's always been.  The first hush puppies many of us ever had and other restaurants try to replicate were crispy on the outside and moist and flavorful in the inside.  The chips could've been a touch hotter, but were so good with the vinegar sprinkled on.  My mom and I had such a yummy and fun lunch talking about family meals at our hometown Arthur Treacher's all those years ago.

I've had lots of different fish, but Arthur Treacher's will always be my first and best fish love.  Thank you for keeping this treasure afloat!"}
