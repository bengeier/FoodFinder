{"text":"Was excited for it opening, hopefully it'll get better, other comments about tea tasting like coming from a garden hose was spot on. Was hoping for an unforgettable cheesesteak but hopefully it was just a bad day. Best of luck Lee."}
{"text":"First of all, the prices are rediculous! Secondly, I got the Tuna and it was bland. I asked for it with everything and it only had lettuce, tomato and tuna. I also asked if it could be heated and they said no. Go to Subway! Cheaper and better food!"}
{"text":"If you want a Philadelphia hoagie, if you want a Philadelphia cheesesteak, then this is your place. Lee's has a great reputation in the Philadelphia area for good food and I was skeptical whether that unique taste would make it down to South Carolina. Well I am happy to report it did! We tried a cheesesteak \"wit wiz\" of course and the italian hoagie. Both delivered the same quality and taste that we remember from up north. I think a big part of a good sandwich is the bread and the hoagie rolls have that excellent texture with slightly crunchy exterior that anyone who has had in the Northeast knows. We also tried the Old Bay fries which were cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. For us the food was prepared promptly without delay and that was during a packed lunch.

There are other sandwich shops in the are and in all fairness they are pretty good but Lee's Hoagie House definitely stands at the head of the pack."}
{"text":"Great hoagie, still trying to figure out what made it so good! Can't wait to try out other menu items. Had the Italian hoagie today would order again."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to see an authentic hoagie house come to Lake Wylie. What a huge disappointment. Hubby and I ordered two of the hoagies. They came with meat, bread, lettuce and tomato. A tablespoon of shredded white lettuce and a few skinny strips of tomato, wedged in the fold of the sandwich. We could not find it until we took a few bites. Optional mayo and oil was hard to find. 

Bread was good and chewy. Lots of meat on the sandwich. But it was tasteless and dry. Where was the oil and vinegar dressing or the cheese? Who wants dry bread and bland lunchmeat?

Sorry Lee's. I won't be coming back. 

Kudos to them for excellent, friendly service.

{"text":"Finally!!! I'm from Philly and there was nowhere to get a Philly cheese steak or hoagie ANYWHERE in SC. They use beef, just like in a hot roast beef sandwich , not steak.. and NO clue about the roll! Lee's uses Amoroso's rolls and real steak ...We are in heaven"}
{"text":"Where do I start with Lee's?  I really want to like this place but every time we go there we encounter some kind of issue.  Just a sample of issues:

1. Soggy Fries with the take out due to them being put in a plastic clamshell.

2. They charge you $1 for old bay on the Fries but then cut corners and just sprinkle it in the bagged fries rather than tossing them first before bagging

3.  Employees eating lunch in dining room and tossing trash at trashcan from 2 tables away

4. Lackadaisical sandwich making, all the meat on the outside of the sandwich so you have to take the sandy apart and rebuild it yourself.


Will not be coming back, mgmt better get a handle on the operations before they lose more customers."}
{"text":"Great. Went there today for the first time and staff was personable, quick, and the food was great. Owners were even on hand.  So much better than other subs in the area. Good find!"}
{"text":"Bit too pricey for a hoagie. Got a half meatball for close to 9 dollars and no side, that was almost 4 dollars for a side of fries, then add a drink. Yikes on prices.  Second visit and service is better, the tea each time has an off taste,  so go with a soda.  Bread is always fresh with an amazingly good flavor.  Fries were hot and big enough to share.  Hoagie could have been hotter with more cheese.  Nice to see they deliver, maybe next time."}
{"text":"So happy to have found Lee's. Growing up in Delaware, I've missed the delicious hoagies I'm accustomed to since moving to the Charlotte area. The food is FANTASTIC! From the cheesesteaks & chicken cheesesteaks, to the Italian, to the wings, mozzarella sticks and old bay fries....ALL OF IT IS DELICIOUS! More importantly they have the REAL hot peppers and HERRS chips! I LOVE this place. Service is wonderful. The Manager is very attentive and courteous! Every time I enter this place he greets me with a smile, promptly answers questions and offers TOP NOTCH SERVICE! I've brought my entire family here and I can speak for them too when I say we thoroughly enjoy this place for our hoagie and HERRS chip fix! Glad they made it down to Lake Wylie and hope they stay a longggg time!"}
{"text":"More like a 2.75... cashier seemed clueless regarding questions about the items. We tried both Philly cheesesteaks and deli subs. We prefer the cheesesteaks and I thought the bread was a little tough and not chewy like some of the previous reviewers. Maybe I  had received a stale loaf. Could look into purchasing from a local bakery. I also think the prices are high for portion and even more so for combos. Lots of nickel  and dime for normal items expected on a standard cheesesteak, like peppers, mushrooms, etc. Service was pretty quick, yet there were way more staff than patrons for a late weekday lunch.  Would definitely just stick to the cheesesteaks here. My co-worker was unimpressed with the deli meats and thought Subway had better quality, that says a lot."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place on Father's Day while heading to Steelecreek for lunch. The Hoagies were very filling. A good variety of food for the entire family. The French fries tasted fresh, like someone had just cut up a potato in the back. The owner was very friendly and interacted with us, we really enjoyed that. The only thing that is keeping me from giving them 5 stars, was the young lady at the counter, she didn't greet us and acted like we annoyed her, while trying to gather order info for our children. Will definitely go back for Football season because of the food and the owner."}
{"text":"Service can be slow but the food is absolutely worth the wait. Hoagies are excellent & the Philly cheesesteaks are legit. Bread is shipped in from Philly & is chewy & delicious. They offer Herr's chips & tasty cakes."}
{"text":"Okay take it from me you will not find a better authentic hoagie or cheesesteak in the south!!! We use to live in Philadelphia and have visited the Lee's up there, this is the only franchise (hopefully more to come)  here and we drive 40 minutes to eat here! It's that good. The service is awesome, the owner comes to talk to you to make sure you're pleased with everything. The lunch meat is so good, the BREAD Puhlease you cannot find bread like this at another \"sub\"
Shop in town. Don't be fooled if you want a true Philly cheesesteak and can't make it up north, just scoot over into SC for the real deal. Delicious and the 9 inch sandwich is a generous potion. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Their food is ok I guess. It wasn't awful, but certainly nothing to write home about. If you order fries, like 4 people can share them! I'm just not sure we will go back having eaten there once before. Not good, but not awful. Definitely not on my top 10 list."}
{"text":"Wow! Finally a Philly cheesesteak worthy of the name. The bread was perfect. I was told it came from NJ. Meat was great, loved the spicy red peppers, it really gave it some zing. And of course onions and cheese whiz!!"}
{"text":"Was anticipating this place opening once I saw that it was going in the shopping center! And wow! It did not disappoint! (It has only been open for 2 days as of now, and it has been quite busy). I ordered a cheese steak, and it tasted very close to what you get in Philly! The bread is so good, too. This will be our go to spot from now on! (Plus they deliver!)"}
{"text":"Being from outside of Philly I was looking forward to trying this place with high hopes, but sorry folks it was a total let down. Waited 45 min for 2 cheesesteaks. Ordered an '18 cheesesteak and onion with extra meat. $23.00 and no extra meat or onions. My wife ordered a cheesesteak with onions.... No onions either. $32.00 for 2 cheesesteaks that weren't even made right!!!! Total Ripoff!!! Plus the tea tastes like it came out of a garden hose! Sorry folks but that is our First & LAST time!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place until the Charlotte Observer listed it as the best place to get a cheesesteak. The Observer was right on the money.  This place  serves the best cheesesteak I have ever eaten. The sandwich is always packed with tender meat and the red pepper spread is sooo good. Can't wait to bring my mother to try the cheesesteak. She is going to love it!!"}
{"text":"Great Hoagies. Very friendly. Definitely leave here full and everything tastes fresh.  Drive a little ways to get here and always worth it."}
{"text":"Walked into this new restaurant never eating at Lee's Hoagie House before or even knowing what types of food they served we were greeted by the Cashier and while looking over the menu Rick the owner of the restaurant came out greeted us we told him this was our first time at the restaurant and he told us about how he ate one of the sandwiches in Philadelphia and he was sold he purchased a franchise and opened this store we ordered what he recommended  1/2 Lee's South Philly and  1/2 Lee's Italian we also ordered 1 order of fries. Service was quick a server brought out our food and the food looked great.
 I would recommend the Lee's South Philly the Italian was just as good but I really like the South Philly the best, now the fries were so good we couldn't stop eating them, one order split was more than enough for two people. We still brought home  1/2 a sandwich it was so much food we couldn't eat it all but wanted to and we were still full by 5 pm from the lunch we ate at 12 pm. I love this new Sandwich Shop and look forward to trying something new the next time."}
{"text":"Not sure we were expecting much but this was by far one of the worst experiences and food we've ever had. Service is non-existent. Cashier did not know what was on the menu. We tried to order a burger and because she couldn't find it on her screen just kept saying well it's not on here. It's on the giant board above your head!!  Then we asked for cups for water. She charged us for sodas instead. When we confronted her about the overcharge she said they only sell bottled water. And yet there are free water cups next to the soda machine (water is dispensed from said machine).  She could care more about her nails and keeping her hands warm than doing her job. Majority of staff could care less and were not even remotely sensible.

It was slow to get the order.  My wife's bun was torn (I had to get a new one which could come from any grocery store). The burger looked like a pale grey frozen slab of meat. She could hardly eat any of it. I ordered a wrap and \"pizza fries\".  I should have asked what was on the fries. It was nacho cheese and cold (COLD!) pizza sauce. Nothing more. I expected something more creative. Like hot and gooey melted cheese with maybe some pepperoni slices and pizza sauce.  Some spice maybe. Not even close.  Wrap was just a ton of shredded lettuce and some generic fried chicken strips in buffalo (hot).  Kids had a sandwich and a hot dog. The hot dog didn't even seem like it was cooked. 

Besides the spice of the buffalo sauce, the ingredients and flavors are totally bland and don't seem like anything more than what I would slap together at home. Except I would use better ingredients and do a much better job of preparing the food. 

This place is new and apparently a franchise. With the menu, standards and service I am baffled as to how they kept one open let alone multiples.  I don't see this lasting. It's like some lousy dive diner in some small town (but NOT like triple D cool) - one that you never want to go into again. Ever. Any other fast food or sandwich shop would be 10 times better."}
{"text":"Terrible! We waited 30 minutes for our take-out order this past weekend and came home and our subs were awful and missing all the extras that we ordered...no lettuce, no tomato, no cheese, etc...  Waste of money."}
{"text":"I ordered the 6\" chicken salad hoagie with a bottled Dr. Pepper. With delivery fee & tip, it was 14.00. It's a bit pricey, especially for lunch. I was nervous about ordering due to some of the online reviews but decided to try it for myself. I must say, I'm super impressed! The employee gave me many recommendations & was so helpful when ordering! My food was delivered within 10 minutes, & the delivery lady was so nice! The food was great & the drink was cold. I gave a 4/5 due to the ONLY con being the price. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for 2 hoagies.  Staff not very experienced, manager offered me a $5 coupon for my inconvenience.  Worst thing of all, the hoagies were not even good.  Will not waste my time there ever again"}
{"text":"Just visited here recently and I was impressed with the food. The tuna wrap is my favorite. I'll recommend that you should give them a chance."}
{"text":"This place is great! The bread makes it unique in that is is just great bread. If you want an authentic Philly Cheesesteak, this place is it. They are also friendly."}
{"text":"The \"whole\" is huge, so be warned. I let my stomach order and went with the whole, choosing the South Philly. Lots of spicy sliced deli meat. Prosciutto, salami, capocollo, plus red peppers and provolone. Very tasty and a very good portion, especially when you let them top it with lettuce and tomatoes and mayo plus onions and spice. Yum.

Restaurant is small but it was clean when I was here and the staff seemed to be taking and filling orders swiftly."}
{"text":"I don't like to give 1 Star however in this case it got at least 1 because it's new and it does have a glimmer of hope to get better.

We ordered 2 things. 6\" Cheeseteak with several toppings and a 9\" chickensteak with lettuce.

We got Cheesesteak with no toppings at all but cheese and a 6\" chickensteak without lettuce. When your 6' 2\" 250 pounds this is not even an appetizer.

The chickensteak was small pieces of shaved chicken, most likely cooked last night or very early this morning, that were soooo dry they looked like woodchips you might have in your flower beds.

It was horrible and after driving 30 minutes full of hope for a great Philly Cheesesteak, I felt like one of the guys on the bus leaving Las Vegas after they lost everything.

Sorry lee's, unfortunately you scared us off for life."}
