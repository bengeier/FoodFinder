{"text":"The food has gone downhill. We ordered French Onion Soup, Nachos, and Chicken Wings. I know, I know, we should have ordered the muscles, but come on - this stuff was on the menu, if they don't want people to eat it, don't put it on the menu. 

The French Onion Soup was 40% cheese, and so sweet - eyes closed - it could have been a caramel macchiato. The wings weren't the worst, but just weren't 1/10th as good as they were last time I was there. They tasted like rotisserie chicken. The nachos - let me just say this about nachos - if the salsa you put on it is actually curry sauce, you need to put that on the menu in giant bold letters. They call it cheddar beer sauce - but again, eyes closed - it's butter chicken sauce. Which isn't bad per se, but what it does to nachos is bad. It makes them into a soggy corn mash about 2 chips down.

The beer cocktails were kind of alright, and the service was ok. You know, just don't eat the food, because it's super gross."}
{"text":"Good, but expensive for what it is.

The selection of literally dozens of different kids of mussels is dizzying. The only thing even more impressive is the enormous beer menu, featuring everything from Belgian trappist ales to local microbrew specialties. The burgers and other food items are creative and tasty, and the portion sizes are reasonable without being stingy. I also enjoy the atmosphere of this restaurant in the summertime, though it should be avoided on the busy Thursday and Friday nights.

The reason I only give it three stars is because everything is way overpriced for the area and for the type of food. You could eat just as well for half the price just about anywhere else nearby. If I wanted to splurge and spend $50 on a meal, I'd expect something much nicer and fancier than this. But for a burger and a beer, or even the all-you-can-eat mussels specials, the price is just astronomical."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were visiting Montreal for the first time, and whist looking for somewhere to have dinner, we stumbled across Bieres et Compagnie. It looked so warm and inviting on what was a very cold evening. We were seated fairly quickly without a reservation. The decor and the ambiance in the place was pretty sweet and relaxing. Decorated with loads of beer bottles and vintage beer adverts. The menu was extensive and mixed, we skipped on the mussels and decided to go for the Chicken and Mushroom burger and some beer battered onion rings to start. The onion rings were awesome. Not soggy but super crisp and delicious! The burger was also amazing, really enjoyable and full of flavour. The only disappointing factor was the fries - they were quite soggy, but came with a choice of mayonnaise. We went for Sun-dried Tomato Mayo and Green Pesto which were pretty good.   We just went for a standard pint of cheap beer each as we were on a budget, but their drinks menu was pretty extensive with some of my favourites in there (Desperado's!) I gave 4 starts based on the fries and it was also a little pricey for what was on offer, it was more like 4.5 starts however because we would definitely go back if we were in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Bières. Moules. On y vas pour sa! Sourtout les jours de moules à volonté. Beau, bon, prix résonable. Le menu de bière est quatre fois plus gros que le menu repas. Sa m'impressionne toujours! Les cocktails à la bières sont si bon!

Les vendredi et samedi soirs vaut mieux réserver, c'est pleins. J'adore la bière, leurs burgers, et leurs services. 
Malheureusement la dernière fois entre l'entrée et le repas principal il y eu 1h d'attente.. Le serveur avais oublier de placer notre commande. Il c'est racheter en nous apportant une bière a mon copain et moi. Mais quand les repas sont arriver.. L'accompagnement de mon copain, purée de pomme de terre goutais le bruler. C'etait anormal.. J'y est gouter moi même. On retourne jamais des plats, mais la c'était inmangable. Le temps qu'il ramène un nouvel accompagnement, il avait terminer son assiette... C'était son aniversaire, quel déception. Le serveur a encore tenter de se racheter avec un shooter de jack. L'intention était bien, au moins il a asseiller. Mais on a été décue..

J'aime toujours le resto.. Mais pour des occasions moins spécial..."}
{"text":"L'ambiance est d'abord excellente : feutrée en soirée avec une déco assez jolie et le niveau de bruit est assez raisonnable pour s'entendre parler. Pour un souper d'anniversaire entre amis, c'était parfait mais l'endroit se prêterait tout aussi bien à un souper en amoureux..
Côté bouffe, mes 2 comparses de la soirée ont essayé les moules qu'ils ont appréciées en général tandis que de mon côté j'ai opté pour le burger d'autruche. L'accompagnement fromage de chèvre et confit d'oignons etait excellent et le burger en soi était bon également, même si je m'attendais à peut-être plus de surprise en bouche vu le type de viande choisi.

En gros, la bouffe était très bien, sans toutefois être à se jeter en bas de ma chaise mais l'endroit vaut surtout le détour pour sa grande sélection de bières et de cocktails faits à partir de celles-ci."}
{"text":"Better beer selection than anywhere else we have been. The French onion soup is different in a good way...its sweetened with carrots and comes with delicious cheddar on top. Our bartender was top rate. Lost one star for lack of draft beer selection, but I think that's a Canadian thing...

They have das boot! 1.5 liters. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Been to this casual with flair restaurant about half a dozen times in the last few years. It's always a pleasant experience.
Their menu is original with bison, dear and ostrich burgers. They have over 30 types of mussels and fries dishes. Tried about 4 or 5 of them and all were very good. The mussel portions are huge while the french fries portions are small.
I also like the fact they have a wide selections of starters and sides than can be ordered when you're not hungry enough for a main course or just want more variety.
Service was nice and prompt. The decor is very interesting but tables are close together and it's a very noisy environment when the restaurant is full (which is most evenings). Too bad they don't have a terrace. It would make it perfect on warm summer nights. Price is not cheap but fair for the food you get and the area.
Oh yes, almost forgot (sorry not much of a drinker) they have a huge selection of beers many of them local from small breweries. It's a great place to sample local offerings if you're a beer lover.
One of my favorite places on St-Denis.
It's a great place to go with friends or family. Not so much for a romantic date unless you like casual and noisy.
I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Bonne ambiance! Service efficace ! Super choix de bières! Un bon repas entre amis! 
Le cadre: Intérieur sympa. C'est assez spacieux. Et pas trop bruyant. 
L'accueil: Une équipe très sympathique qui prend le temps d'échanger sur les bières. Arrivés un jeudi soir à 19h, le temps d'attente après notre commande a été très raisonnable.
Plats et prix: Très varié en Bières ! Plats copieux et joliment présentés. Nous nous sommes laissés tenter par entre autres par: Pâté chinois (Buf braisé à la Bière rousse) à 25$ et Poutine (Buf braisé à la Bière rousse) à 15$. Rien de transcendant. Pour autant, rien de grandement déplaisant.
Conclusion : J'y retournerai avec des amis de passage sur Montréal!!! En début de semaine idéalement pour trinquer et tester la dégustation de moules !"}
{"text":"This corner restaurant on bustling St. Denis in the Plateau district is a crowd pleaser. We came with our kids (ages 4, 9, 12) for the moules et frites! (Of course, we adults also enjoyed sampling a few libations from the menu de bières.) The best surprise is the all you can eat mussels (same price) Mon-Weds nights! We took advantage of that!

Service was prompt and friendly. Many choices for mussels--stick to the ones printed in red. Some of the more classic varieties lacked flavor. Although, the mussels themselves were tasty creatures. 

The fries are excellent and they offer several dipping sauces. Bon appetit."}
{"text":"Yum. Have been twice on 2 visits to Montreal. Not at all touristy, plenty of tables at lunchtime. Beer list is all in French but on second visit our server recommended a local Montreal beer Coup de Grisou which was a buckwheat spicy beer that become our favorite. We are so sad it is available in the US! Lots of variations of mussels to choose fun, large portion for a hefty price, but worth it. You get a big bowl of frites and choice of mayo flavors, we liked the dijon better than the spicy. Check it out!"}
{"text":"a great list of choices for beers and drinks. lots and lots and lots of choices for mussels. almost too much with a few ones similar. but still a really good place for mussel fries. i would say the fries are on the light side. 
deserts were awesome, though a little pricey. 
staff is nice but not really exceptional, provided we arrived late on a saturday night. but good service makes for great tips, and we didn't get \"great\"  service. still it was decent and we had a good time. i will go again."}
{"text":"I am sad to have to give a poor review to one of my favorite restaurants going back 9 years. It appears the owner has decided to turn it into a quasi-night club, with a DJ and music turned up to extremely loud. But at 830 pm?? How can anyone enjoy a meal with friends when everyone is shouting and straining to hear? Bad choice Mr. Owner. When I complained, the staff responded quite apologetically (they seem to know about the problem), but were not able to get the sound lowered to acceptable levels. My speaking up about this earned me several high fives from other patrons. But where were all the customers? Place was unusually empty..... Oh yeah, the disco atmosphere drove people away. If the situation is corrected, I will gladly update this review. Aside from excess noise, food was great (as usual), and the staff were friendly and charming."}
{"text":"Three of us went here on a Tuesday evening at around 6:30. We were greeted by the hostess and shown to our seats. That was it. 15 minutes later after no one aknowledged that we were there except for the hostess who kept on sneaking into the kitchen and coming back out pretending not to chew on something.

We slowly got up and left. No staff even noticed.

I can understand if they were packed, but not even close."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for mussels and beer. Two dozen varieties of mussel sauces and over a hundred different beers from local breweries and worldwide. Each beer is served in its appropriate branded glassware and on its branded coaster. Fries come with the mussels and a choice of fine dipping sauces. Yum. You need to reserve on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to go \"close to home\" I saw a listing for a Bières et Compagnie in Terrebonne. Having heard good things about the St Denis location we decided to give it a try so we made reservations as we headed out. The reservations ended up being a good idea as the place was pretty full at 8:30 on a Friday. 

We were pleasantly surprised!

The beer menu is extensive; pages and pages of imported beers grouped by country of origin....staggering for someone like me whose beer palate is limited to \"I prefer white beer\". Our waitress was great though, she asked what we usually drank and was quite knowledgeable. Her recommendation was delicious and I loved the attention to detail as each beer came out with its own logo glass and coaster (I'm a sucker for matchy-matchy!). 

I was even more surprised by the food menu (bison, caribou or ostrich burger anyone?) which had a lot of interesting choices. I had the bison burger - it was delicious! Well cooked, juicy and generous and served with fries and chips and a green salad. It definitely hit the spot!

The place wasn't much in the way of décor but it wasn't a bad way to spend a Friday night!"}
{"text":"The mussels were excellent. The french fries were mediocre, but the choucroutte (sauerkraut) was awful: large chunks of hard uncooked cabbage with carrots, potatoes, and, admittedly some slices of sausage all floating in warm water. It ruined our evening.
Ed"}
{"text":"I've never had a problem getting seated here. I've been in for both lunch and dinner several times, as well as for the occasional afternoon drinks-and-dessert. The food is very good--dinner especially, I think, when you can get any number of game meats in addition to the usual beef, chicken, and mussels. I've especially enjoyed the bison here. There are also some great desserts--the cheesecake is recommended!

The highlight of this place, though, is the beer. Oodles and oodles of options, pretty much all of them reasonably priced. I'm a big fan of the \"beer cocktails\" menu--you wouldn't think, to read them, that some of the combinations on the list would be good, but truly, all of them (and we've tried a number of them) have been very, very tasty. The Guinness-and-cider Black & Tan \"cocktail\" is really good, and sort of fascinating to watch as it mixes itself together over time!

There aren't many places in the world where you could go with your sweetie and also with a big group; this is a restaurant that could and does ably serve in both situations. The booths can be cozily romantic or full of a crowd, depending.

I don't find the lunch menu as compelling as the dinner menu. While it is well-priced for a very solid lunch, I don't think it is nearly as spectacular. So save your cash, and come here in the evening--you'll leave pleasantly stuffed and pleasantly tipsy."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and with a smile. I had the European mussels and our waiter made good suggestions on beers. I can't resist mussels, it's a weakness. The ambiance was cute for a date or an intimate group dinner."}
{"text":"If you like mussels, this place will do ;) 3 pages of different mussel dishes, a full beer menu + it's been around for long enough that you know no one has ever been poisoned here (which is the first thing I look for in a mussel restaurant)."}
{"text":"bieres, moules & frites. Voila les 3 mots décrivant cet endroit phare du centre-ville de Montréal.

Bien honnêtement, je n'ai pas été impressionnée. Je prend rarement des moules au restaurant car je suis souvent déçue. Cette fois je croyais que ça y était ! Que j'allais enfin avoir de bonnes moules. Pour être honnête, elles m'ont donné mal au coeur : croquer des grains de sable dans ma sauce marinara était assez moyen. Les drinks a la bière géants étaient bons, pour compenser. 

Une chance que le serveur était sympathique et que j'étais en bonne compagnie.. !"}
{"text":"My first time in Montreal! I have heard so much about the food here and because my bf and I were only here for two days, we (or I) wanted to maximize my eating experience. My bf brought me to this very popular brunch place (name eludes me now) and the line was INSANE! I am normally not a stand-in-line girl, but add to the fact that it was FRICKIN cold, I was dying. And I was hungry. I was so hungry that I told my bf I just wanted to eat at St. Hubert's for lunch as it was close by. Yes, St. Hubert's as my first restaurant destination in Montreal!

Luckily, we also passed by this pub, which I thought was just a regular pub...until we stepped in. This is a classy, glorified, upscale pub...whatever you want to call it. The place was pretty empty and we got to sit in nice circular booths...stars for that! As with other reviews, you come here for the mussels and we were not disappointed. However, can anyone really do mussel's badly?

Because I was planning a birthday dinner for my bf, I wanted to eat light. And of course, my \"light\" was ordering the sausage dish with your choice of two HUGE sausages, salad and a compliment of different mustards. Delish, but feeling absolutely full. I couldn't even imagine eating dinner...which is probably why I got sick after my dinner (another review on that).

There are lots of beers here and my bf tried a local Quebecois choice. I had some beer with a polar bear as the icon...refreshing to say the least.

All in all, not bad. I loved the atmosphere, but it was quiet and for a late lunch. From other reviews, the service may be on or off, but ours was certainly nothing to complain about. The food also didn't disappoint (BIG PORTIONS), and you can never go wrong with a wide selection of beers."}
{"text":"I had a pint of beer and a small bowl of fries here, while waiting for a friend. Nice ambiance, good micro brew beer. Sweet potato fries comes with selection of mayonnaise, nice."}
{"text":"Spacious pub with a large patio and open feel. They have a great selection of beers from all over the world along with quite a few local brews from around Quebec. Very diverse menu in burgers alone you can choose from venison and pancetta, bison, chicken and beef. I also noticed many other tasty looking options. They also serve fresh mussels in a variety of ways. Today I tried the red deer and pancetta burger with escargots in a cream sauce starter with mystique cider from Quebec. Everything was delicious and the staff were very friendly. The staff also spoke English so it's great for out of province visitors to try out as well.

The menu is priced slightly higher than your average bar but it feels appropriate as it has a classier feel and menu."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place!!!  Perfect place for sustenance after a full day visiting the Botanical Gardens + Insectarium.  Why the love? 1) An extensive/impressive beer selection (Unibroue, now one of my new fave beer makers - hope I can find their brews in Ca!); 2) Food: Fully loaded nachos with bacon, sausage, chicken, black olives, cheese + onions. Bison burger was juicy and flavorful; 3) Great service/ambiance - definitely mellower vibe in the early evening, but still all good. ;-)"}
{"text":"Great food [the menu has pages and pages of Mussels!] and lots of microbrews. Seating can be tough, but it's worth the [short] wait."}
{"text":"Got the burger of the month.  Was good but not exceptional.  The menu is a little pricy for the quality and service."}
{"text":"If you like a mind-blowing beer and mussels selection, then get your butt here pronto. I was blown away by the beer list, which is far bigger than their menu. Nevertheless, I have never seen so many delectable mussel creations served piping hot and super delicious. Everything I drank and ate was shear bliss and it wasn't as pricey as I expected. The quality of beer, mussels and service made this place a favorite of mine. Go here with friends, a date, or just by yourself if you don't want to share."}
{"text":"Vous devez essayez le Moules Frites à volonté du Dimanche au Mercredi!
Pas cher et super bon!
Vous avez un choix parmis une vingtaine de sauces différente, toutes apprétées avec de la bière biensur!
Bon choix de bières locale et importations sur place.
Le service est un peu lent, mais les serveurs(ses) souriants!
Je vous le suggère grandement!"}
{"text":"The beer list is great and the atmosphere is very relaxed compared to the rest of the area.  We got a few burgers that were really interesting.  Caribou burger was decent and the ostrich with goat cheese was great!  They know how to make an awesome french fry and the best part was that they were topped with sweet potatoes chips that were really delicious.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Very funky brewpub that would fit right in on South Street Philadelphia.  Open late with great pub food, we got the locally made sausages which were excellent, thankfully they do not serve poutine, the ghastly signature snack of Montreal.  Make good beers as well as stock an huge international list of bottles.  Walked by it for 3 days until a nasty rainy evening and it was across from our hotel, so we went in and happy we did."}
{"text":"La déco est très belle avec lumière tamisé. pour cette soirée j'ai opté pour un drink avec de la bière la Cervoise j'ai adorer se mélange de dorée cidre et lime. pour du choix de moule il en a du choix. le plus difficile c'est de se décider. alors j'ai opter pour les bière et ci avec crotte de fromage. J'ai été un peu déçu car le bouillon manquais un peu de saveur a mon goût. Le service étais bon et efficace 
j'y retournerai surement pour essayer une autre sorte de moule."}
{"text":"There's a simple satisfaction with the pairing of Belgium Beers and Mussels.
I was quite excited to have Bières et Compagnie on my path of consumption.
100 kinds of local & imported Beers can make anybody excited and blushing.
Moules prepared in every way possible with a handful cooked in Beer, oui Beer.
Can you feel the same excitement I did when I read this on their website?

We happened to arrive to Bières et Compagnie late on a weeknight.
Place 3/4 empty therefore service staff were probably proportional.
We were simply easy prey and all the service had to do was act enthusiastic.
Neither that nor a smooth interaction were provided for us. (-1.00 star)

Back to my main reason for being...
Moules of the Bières & Cie.  Most of them have some sort of Cheese as ingredient.
I'm not adverse to Fromage but I rather think if integrated as a Bechamel is better.
It was difficult to get the stringy Cheese in any bite and much of it was sidelined.
Otherwise it was Moules to be enjoyed with great company. (-0.50 star)

The Beer menu did have lots of Imports most of which I've had in LCBO or elsewhere.
It was Quebec Craft Beer that I supported.  Le Cheval Blanc - Coup de Grisou(weiss)
The dim lit pub space did make the 1/4 of customers near the bar somewhat douchey.
Think Torontos Elephant&Castle with darkwood furnished, grand decor & high ceiling.

It is what it is, isn't is?  Next place moving on..."}
{"text":"Came back w friend & took advantage of the ayce which was a great deal. 

Good tv screens and lots of bieres. Service could b better & tables get tight w all the items they bring u for the mussels & beers."}
{"text":"Before Yelp came to Canada I found myself wandering St Denis not knowing where to eat. That was 4 summers ago. When I searched \"Mussels\" on Yelp recently, I came face to face with the very place I passed an evening drinking fruity beers from a staggering list and nibbling on frites. And how happy was I to find an old favourite.

This time, I was floored by the choices in mussels - three pages worth! Between the Guinness or wine broth blended with a symphony of onions, tomatoes and other tasty ingredients there's no way of getting bored of the choices, unless of course you're not into mussels. 

And if that's the case... the medley of sausage might be just up your alley! Ostrich, duck and beef, served with fries. If I could chose again, I'd ask for three of the duck sausage with it's citrus goodness. And in the department of fry dips, I'd go Dijonnaise over and over and over again. (You get one dip with every order of fries, but you'll have to specifically request ketchup)

Grab a beer, or a bite, or both. There's plenty of seats, lots of TVs, lively posters and an overall atmosphere that will make you feel like a local."}
{"text":"Bières et Compagnie does one thing, and they do it right. Hundreds of varieties of beer, with food pairings to match. 

The beer menu is so long, it's overwhelming, with beers from all over the world, and many Quebec microbreweries. Each beer is described in menus in English et en Français, and the wait staff are knowledgeable and happy to make recommendations to assist in finding something you'll like.

The dinner menu features tons of things that go great with beer, and many dishes cooked with beer. They have mussels prepared 30 different ways, we tried a couple different styles, the mussels were very fresh and the sauces were delicious. They also have hamburgers, bison burgers, ostrich burgers, caribou burgers... you get the idea. 

This was wifey's favorite restaurant of our week-long foodie tour of Montreal. 

They also introduced her to her new favorite beer of all time:
Dieu du Ciel Route des Épices is a red ale flavored with black pepper. It's unique, spicy, and delicious.

If we're ever in Montreal again, Bières et Compagnie will be at the top of our list to go back to.

Merçi Bières et Compagnie!"}
{"text":"I'm a brew pub junkie, and on the West Coast, we have a lot of them.  I was really seeking a chill place to check-out in Montreal, and certainly found it here.  Their beer menu (in French) was extensive, but a bit hard to understand.  Yeah, I know, I'm one of those English-speaking Americans who should take the time to learn the local language.  I'm a beer snob, and I'm used to a little-bit better descriptions of the beer in the menu, but I was certainly overwhelmed by the selection.

The food was above average, and the wait staff was pretty-okay.  If you're looking for an amazing selection of beer, coupled with pretty good food, this location won't disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is my heaven. :D

I went here one night with my boyfriend and we were both pleasantly surprised at how amazing both the food and beers are!

We went in the early evening and had no trouble getting a table. I ordered the ostrich burger with carmelized onions and goat cheese. He ordered a buffalo burger with green peppercorn and beer sauce. The burgers came with a side of their homemade french fries and a small side salad. 

My food was DELICIOUS! I wouldn't change anything about it. My boyfriend enjoyed his beer and burger, but was open to trying new things next time we visit.

The service was good, not something to rave or complain about. The selection of beers is ridiculously good, with over 100 beers to choose from. Some of them are from local microbreweries, while others are really tasty imports from several different countries. 

Good food and good beers... heaven."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on our first night in Montreal. It was close to our apt and a little off the beaten path. We were seated at a table and though this place specializes in brews we decided on a bottle of rose. It was moderately priced and not too dry. For dinner i chose on a small caesar salad and a small pot of mussels. There are about 10 different the of mussels to choose from I opted for the leek,cream and garlic. The caesar salad was plain but came avec bacon... interesting but strange. The small mussels looked more like a large i wasn't able to finish the whole pot. A few were un opened which usually isn't a good sign. Im not really sure how large the large is but  the small was more than enough for me. The only downside was that i didn't get any fries with my mussels but the plat size comes with fries so if you are super hungry then the large pot will be your best bet. Our server was super nice and suggested a few bars for us to check out on rue mont royal.I would come back here for sure.

PS Loads of TV's for catching up on the sports action"}
{"text":"Ce pub d'inspiration belge, où on se targue d'offrir un choix de 100 bières, a répondu à mes attentes. J'ai commandé une assiette de moules et de frites et, pour ce qui est de l'incontournable bière qui doit accompagner un tel plat, j'y ai été avec valeur sûre : une Duvel. Le service était courtois et relativement rapide, et les moules (et la bière) excellentes. Toutefois, j'amènerais un bémol : ma portion était plutôt petite et j'avais encore faim après l'avoir dévorée. Du reste, il est possible de pallier à cette petite lacune, puisque le restaurant offre une option moules à volonté du dimanche au mercredi."}
{"text":"Pas ouf du tout. J'ai été très déçue par cet endroit. Je m'étais fait une joie de manger des moules c'était très mal cuit et pas goutu. Je préfère de loin celle que je cuisine. Je ne recommande pas du tout ce restaurant. Dommage que le restaurant La moulerie sur Bernard n'existe plus."}
{"text":"I wish I had more time to spend at this place because I really want to try more of their menu. Spending a long weekend in Montreal and came across this after much yelping for a high quality beer-food combo. 

The beer selection is ridiculous. Most of the varieties are a bit further afield than what I get to taste in my travels, which was a welcome surprise. There are about 8 beers on tap, and the rest are in bottles. My one complaint, beer-wise, was that they dedicate more of their menu to drafts. Who wants to schill out $8-11 for a 12oz?!

I had the European hot dog, which was really tasty. It was served in a hearty roll, but midway through it became a bit too much, so I tossed it aside to enjoy the sausage/mustard combo. Flavorful without being too overpowering. They have five house mayonnaises; I tasted the spicy garlic and the dijonnaise. Both were great, but I was hoping for a more distinct mustard flavor from the latter. 

Girlfriend got the burger. Had a couple of bites. It was good, but nothing special. I was surprised to learn that they only cook it well done, even after asking for medium rare. Is that a legal thing? It seems absurd to so overcook good beef. If that's the case, what do French restaurants serve in lieu of tartare??

Next time, I intend to come hungrier and try out one of the many mussel varieties that they have on offer. Definitely on my list of places to try again the next time I make it back to Montreal!"}
{"text":"On my three day trip to Montreal, I made the rare move of eating here twice. The atmosphere is nothing special and reminds me of any brew pub. However, the menu is huge and the value is incredible. The menu had to contain at least 50 beers and thirty preparations of mussels, as well as numerous appetizers, steaks, and burgers. Each portion comes with a huge dish of French fries and house-made sweet potato chips. I had the caribou burger and the bison steak here. Both tasted great and very reasonably priced. 

FYI: The burgers are cooked well done by default, so be sure to let your server know if you prefer your burgers cooked less."}
{"text":"This place is a Quebec chain. The restos are conveniently located, large enough to generally accommodate you whenever you show up. Large plastic menu in the style of American chains, but in French and with an emphasis on foods we dig here in Quebec like moules et frites and smoked meat. The food is average, but if you go for beers and fries during 5a7 you're likely to leave feeling buoyant and ok with your life choices. It's called joie de vivre =)"}
{"text":"Many things. First, we had terrible service. The place was almost empty and it always took the guy forever to come and serve us, and he was cold and disinterested. When we asked for some recommendations, you could see that he had just no idea what he was talking about and at one point he served us the wrong kind of glass for the type of beer we ordered.

They have a lot of beer choices, but most of them are generic \"imports\" (Heineken, Stella Artois, Sapporo, Hoegaarden, Grolsch) or basic local product (Boréale, Unibroue) all of which you can find at any local stores. But oh my... those prices... all of those were like 9$ for a little 341ml bottle. You can almost get a six pack for that price literally a few feet away.

Then they had some other lesser-known imports which could have been interesting, but were something like $12-17 for 341ml bottles. Crazy prices considering you can get many awesome microbrews just around the corner for like 7$ a pint.

Will never set foot again."}
{"text":"Ok so if you like beer, come here. Seriously. Just do it. You will thank me later. Why? 

Because they have over 100 beers to choose from, all countries, some local, all alcohol %, fruit, not fruit, amber, dunkel, weiss..you name it they have it. I am not a big beer fan, but I enjoyed the 3 that I tried.

Next. If you like seafood, come here for the mussels. Seriously. Just do it. You will thank me later. Why? 

Because they have over 25 sauces for mussels! I got the irlandaise mussels which were amazing! And then split (I forgot the name!) an Italianone? Maybe Romanoff with a friend and omg they were super amazing. You will not leave here hungry that is for sure and on weekends apparently there are free refills on the fries and mussels! Whaaaaaaa? 

Also, calling ahead got us in pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"Dined here just last night after feeling conflicted on where to go. I immediately knew we chose right upon entering the restaurant. It was dark and busy without being packed, and every table seemed to be in great spirits. I got a burger with spicy garlic mayo and an American IPA. Food was solid despite the fact that the burger was only available well done. The real winner for me were the fries and mayo combo. Definitely ate more of them than I had intended to. (I think there were like 3 left) only star off comes from pricey beer, though that seems to be the norm around town. I wish there was a place that had such an amazing beer selection that I could actually reasonably afford to try a variety of. Staff was nice and very accommodating to out of towners. Overall, a satisfying pick for beer people."}
{"text":"Fun, cheerful and great selection of drinks of course :). Menu offers a good variety and ifyou're a burger fan, the selection  of different meats to try is fun; bison, caribou and even ostritch! Of course, if you like  mussels, this is your place ;)"}
{"text":"What can possibly go wrong with a combination of beer and mussels, really nothing if you have extensive beer list and huge mussel flavor options. The problem is the mussels in this pub are a little bit hit and miss the way they are prepared, they are either not cooked enough or not the best quality, difficult to determine. I'd rather have small quantity of good mussels then one kilo of whatever you are served. The French fries are not something to rave about either. Nevertheless the menu offers many more food options and nice table d'hôte choices. 

The ambiance is charming, beautiful salon with old wooden windows and mirrors, rather classic than old fashioned. I can only complain about the grey paint on the walls, so much not in place. Besides that the service is really nice, you will find attention when you need it and will be left alone when you wish.

The beers on tap are limited, but this is compensated by the bottled ones. Finding beers from less known or hardly known, or famous breweries in Quebec is always such a pleasure, besides the enormous import list. 

I think I'll continue to come to this  place as I want to give it a chance for more stars."}
{"text":"I wound up at Biere et Compagnie for a 5 à 7.  A few people in the group lived in Terrebonne so we made the trek out here.  It's a pretty large restaurant and it also offers up a nice terrasse to make the  most of the summer weather.

Given how it's called Biere et Compagnie they should have a decent beer selection and that was indeed the case.  The menu offered many different Quebec microbrews.  If you don't like beer they also have other drinks to meet your needs.

When it comes to food you can expect standard bar food. Mussels are supposed to be their specialty but not being a fan of them I went for a bison burger instead.  It was well-seasoned and juicy and the portion was pretty big.  That was followed by pouding chomeur.  While I normally love this French Canadian dessert this one had way too much syrup on it to the point where the cake was swimming in it.  It was overkill honestly.

With regards to the service it could have been better.  At times it was slow and some of the servers didn't seem to know the menu too well.  We also had trouble getting our waitress' attention.  Even the others couldn't be bothered to call her for us.  As a whole it felt rather indifferent.  

Prices were what you would expect to pay.  My bill was about $ 40 which was pretty reasonable.  In all the experience was so so.  If you're in that particular area of Terrebonne it is probably your best option because there didn't seem to be much else in the immediate vicinity but I probably wouldn't detour for it."}
{"text":"La note de passage seulement pour cet endroit! Le service était super long (on a dû demander à commander puisque personne n'est venu nous donner de l'eau ou nous demander de commander en 20 minutes...). La bouffe était juste correcte... L'entrée de salade César était ordinaire, toute ma laitue était très rouillée. Le fish n chip était bon, mais les frites manquaient de goût et étaient extrêmement grasse. La salade de choux en accompagnement: trop de Mayo, je ne l'ai pas mangée. Mon copain a pris le sandwich steak philly. Correct encore une fois, rien d'épatant. Le dessert était un \"gateau frigidaire\", soit un gâteau étagé de biscuits Graham et pouding. Pas mauvais, mais vraiment basique pour un resto on s'entend!! Avec 2 bières, ça nous a coûté 60$ (+tip). C'est très cher pour la qualité de la nourriture et du service. La terrasse était toutefois agréable, bien que très bruyante et agitée dû à son emplacement."}
{"text":"C'est un bon pub d'inspiration européenne avec une très belle sélection de bières de partout dans le monde, incluant ceux du Québec. Les moules et frites avec la petite sauce maison est un vrai délice pour la bouche. Le service est courtois mais aussi rapide. Malheureusement les prix sont relativement élevés pour goûter une bière québécoise qu'on retrouve au dépanneur du coin. J'ai quand même été satisfait et je vais probablement repasser faire un tour prochainement."}
{"text":"While this is not the best place to have a quiet, romantic dinner because the music is always very loud - they even have speakers outside the restaurant... I don't get that - it is hands down the best place in Montreal for mussels, fries and killer homemade mayo."}
{"text":"This place is an exceptional gastropub.  A well-curated and extensive selection of beers, primarily focused on Belgians, it seems.  Local brewers are nicely represented in the list, as well as a wide range of imports.  There really isn't a beer there that I wouldn't consider enjoying.  

While there, we enjoyed De Block's Satan Gold, St. Ambroise Apricot Wheat from McAuslan, Unibroue's Don de Dieu, and Leffe's Radieuse, all of which constitute an excellent cross-section of the local and imported offerings.

The food was a brilliant complement to the beer; much of the food incorporates beer from their list in its preparations.  Notably, Bieres Et Compagnie offers a large range of preparations of mussel, as well as several gourmet burgers and other main dishes.

We spent much of a weeknight at this spot; it was fairly full but not overly crowded and with a good atmosphere.  We had a friendly server with good beer knowledge, and will happily find ourselves here again in the future next time we are in town.  It's a no-brainer stopping point for beer fans."}
{"text":"3 star for the food and the beer... 2 star for the service (one of the worst I experienced in Montreal during my short trip)

Bieres et compagnie has great selections of beer... pages and pages of beers... hard to make a choice especially the place is so dark...  Can you move the candle over?

Mussels... mussels are really good! I really enjoyed them... they are big and fresh and the broth just prefect with a hint of beer.

Hard to get any services... we were seated for a long time before anyone would take our orders... and then just wait for everything....  

The waitresses were busy talking to the patrons at the bar and the place was not even busy... maybe it was too dark they couldn't see us in the dark?"}
{"text":"Went there with a bunch of friends. Ordered various mussel dishes, fries and beers. The mussels were OK - though mine were a bit sandy and on the small side. Flavors were decent enough. Good beer selection. Solid service - nothing to write home about though. With all that said, I'd go back. Nice atmosphere for a late summer day."}
{"text":"Bières - impressionnant! Leur catalogue de bières est vraiment impressionnant, ce qui m'amène à faire juste une toute petite remarque. Si vous êtres du type à ne pas savoir quoi prendre sur le menu du Tim Horton, vous allez mourir là! À ma mémoire, près d'une dizaine (si ce n'est pas plus) de pages 

Service - décent! Considérant le nombre de bières au menu, les serveurs(-euses) connaissent bien leurs produits. 

Ambiance - Bien! Un décor simple et sans de concept particulier. Mais bon, je suis peut-être trop habitué à des décors de pub. Préférence personnelle ! Ça n'enlève rien à l'expérience gustative pour ma part."}
