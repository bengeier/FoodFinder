{"text":"We happened to be in the area and decided to try Kanda Izakaya. I must say we had a pleasant experience. The servers were attentive and friendly. We ordered 3 dishes: shoyu ramen, salmon oshizushi and spicy scallop roll.   We both got complimentary miso soup and salad which was very nice. We didn't get charged for green tea which is a pet peeve of mine.   Food arrived quickly. As frequent ramen eaters, we were quite surprised at the quality of the ramen for an izakaya. I wouldn't expect the ramen to be as good as specialized ramen shops but it was just what we needed on a cold day! The flavour on the salmon oshizushi (pressed sushi) was delicious. I thought the rice to fish ratio was good. Spicy scallop roll had scallop, crab and some tempura pieces. Not really what I expected but tasted great.   Overall, we had a great dining experience and wouldn't hesitate to come back. As picky Japanese food eater, it's a thumbs from from me!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! The food tasted amazing and everything was so fresh. The servers were really cute! I was with my Deaf friend and they were trying to learn a little bit of sign language. Really cute!"}
{"text":"There isn't much to this place as a dining experience. If you treat it as entertainment, it might be a bit better for what you're paying.  We saw this place when it was advertising a grand opening promotion. The reviews on yelp were fairly high (despite there being 10 reviews that were filtered out as possible spam), so we figured why not let's give it a shot.  It's a pretty small restaurant. Cramped even. Some tables were so close that it was pretty difficult to even move around.  We decided to try several different items on the menu. Salmon tataki, beef tataki, tuna tataki, takoyaki, okonomiyaki, karaage, sashimi platter, kanda rolls, grilled saba, and oden. Each dish came up one or two at a time at 3-5 minute intervals. Since we were sharing, it was alright, but if each person's dishes came at this kind of rate where the last dish arrived 30 minutes after the first, imagine how terrible it must be for the last person (actually, we did have one person order their own dishes, and his did come at the very end).  Flavors were what I would expect from an AYCE place, though I think I would have preferred an AYCE place. The mackeral was just charred, the oden came with some pieces of fish cakes, there wasn't much chicken in the karaage, tataki was overpowered by the garnishing.  We had to ask for the waitress to check on the sashimi platter. I guess the kitchen must've forgot about it, cause it would be served up in \"2 minutes\". And indeed, it came in minutes. For $16 or so, you're getting 3 small pieces of salmon, 3 small pieces of tuna, one shrimp, 4 scallops, and a crab stick cut in half. What's up with the crab stick?  At the end of the meal, we had 8 empty dishes piled up on the table because everytime another dish came, the old ones (which were empty by the time the new ones arrived) were just left there and we had to pile them up so there was room to set the new ones down.  There are many other izakaya's in town. And plenty of generic japanese sushi places as well."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner and the owner was extremely friendly and helpful. The servers were attentive and very fast with the orders.  The food was great and price was very reasonable.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for casual drinks and food."}
{"text":"My name is Hiro I worked for kanda izakaya. I have a lot of regular customers. It was fun!!also Keep going bro!! Actually food is awesome as well quality if you've never tried kanda  izakaya's food You should try it after you will obesess with food!! Especially salmon oshizushi was awesome!! Also chefs are professional. Thank you for giving me a lot of experiences. Good luck your business man!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were there a couple weeks ago. The service was very slow on a weekday night. We see 3 servers in the restaurant but they all seem to be busy taking care of take out orders instead of paying attention to their customers. It took us a while to get their attention to ask for the menu, then another 10 mins to ask for tea... Food was average. We each ordered a ramen and some sides. My husband ordered the roasted garlic shoyu ramen and got food poisoning that night!"}
{"text":"This is my first review and it belongs to Kanda. It's probably my favourite Japanese place in Toronto so far. I was really surprised by the quality and the passion they have in food. We ordered a deluxe chirashi don, some rolls (as half price for the 2nd rolls, yay!) and ramen (must-try the noodles!) . They were fresh, authentic and tasty with reasonable price. The servers were super friendly as well. Overall, amazing and unexpected experience."}
{"text":"I normally don't write long reviews but there were so many things wrong with my first experience at Kanda.   I was very disappointed especially since I was looking forward to the grand opening. We ordered over 8 plates - every dish was mediocre. I understand it was a busy opening night so food might have been rushed, but it just wasn't very good.  Tuna tataki didn't have much flavor and just tasted like smoke. Beef tataki was seared so poorly and just tasted like burnt meat off of a BBQ grill. The fried garlic on top if the tataki was also burnt.  The ramen was okay, not very authentic so my friend commented. The boxed sushi was rather large, but not with fish, but large because of the amount of rice they used.   The karaage is not like the typical pieces you would get at other restaurants. The chicken pieces were cut very small so it came out dry. It included the pieces of battered skin and knee cartilage. Definitely not a karaage dish. The gyoza had very little meat in the middle. You're better off eating the gyozas at an AYCE sushi place.   We ordered the Kanda roll because the description said it was topped with lobster. The roll was tiny and unevenly rolled and cut. The lobster on top was just skippy lobster legs soaked in mayo. The end pieces of my roll didn't even have lobster on top.  The deluxe chirashi had various types of fish, uni, and sweet shrimp. The portion of seafood was small but was very fresh. The shrimp and uni was delicious but was not worth $19.  You're better off going to another izakaya."}
{"text":"Very friendly staffs. Good food and environment. Ramen is excellent. This is definitely a place to enjoy."}
{"text":"Heard about this place so I decided to stop by last week. Service was good but wasn't too impressed with the food. Tea was cold and broth was a little bland. I also tried the beef tataki which I thought wasn't too tasty either. 3 stars for average food, nothing that would make me want to come back although service was good even when it got busy."}
{"text":"Grand opening: 40% off? Sign me up! Grandpa and I actually took the subway up. It was surprisingly easy, given that this place is like a 3 minute's walk from Eglinton Station.  I'd been to Kanda once during their soft opening, and had given the owners some feedback. They're actually really responsive in that regard. When I came back for the grand opening, they'd fixed some of the issues! While there were a number of service issues on Grand Opening day, I get it. Nothing drastic happened. No one dropped food in my lap, no one yelled at me, and I didn't find anything gross in my food. It just took a little longer than I would have expected. From the comments everyone else seems to have gotten on their reviews, it looks like Kanda is going to be fixing up those issues anyways.  Grandpa and I ordered more food than we could eat. I mean, 40% off? EAT ALL THE FOOD. I had wanted to sit at a 4 person table with better lighting so I could take pretty pictures and have all the food on the table, but given how busy they were soon after we started ordering, I can see why they refused.  Maguro tataki, which even at regular price, is a pretty good portion. 7 pieces for $8.99. The pieces aren't like thinly sliced beef tataki either. They're thick enough to have some chew. Next time, I'm going to try the beef or the salmon tataki. Tuna is pretty, but I get bored easily, and I've had their tuna twice now. I very seldom order anything twice consecutively at restaurants, especially if they have a large menu.  Rainbow oshizushi - shrimp, tuna, salmon? It was supposed to be 8 pieces, but I think they cut it wrong, so I had 6 slightly awkwardly large pieces. I let them know about the error, received an additional 10% off on top of my 40%, and saw that they had fixed it by dinner service (stalking Instagram foodies to the max!) This was Grandpa's favorite dish of the day, and he usually doesn't like to eat sushi with rice (sashimi kinda guy). I like how there's a smokey flavor to their oshizushi. I also like how they incorporated the avocado in your typical rainbow roll into it not by placing the avocado on the top and then torching it, but putting it in one of the rice layers. I'm not at all a fan of cooked avocado, so this works really well for me.  Spicy salmon and avocado donburi - I believe this was $9.99 regular price on their lunch menu. It was not spicy and the portion was on the smaller side, but still good for the discounted price. I really like the container they used to plate it as well. It was one of those round sushi trays. I can see the presentation being gorgeous if they work it well.  Unagi roll + Sushi pizza - This one's a lunch special combo. You can pick two of a number of sushi options including rolls, sushi pizza, or torched sushi, and the two plus soup and salad, if I recall correctly, will cost $9.99. It's a good deal at $9.99. It's a great deal with that discount (but what isn't?) The two dishes came separately, and there was some space between the two coming, but I was taking a bunch of pictures, so it's not like my table was ever without food. The unagi roll had avocado in it, which is a plus in my books! The sushi pizza had chopped salmon and tobiko on it, and it was rather pretty. There was also a decent ratio between the fish on top and the rice on the bottom. I know sushi pizza isn't traditional, but I really like it. A sushi pizza like this costs like $9-$11 at other places, and I got that and an unagi roll for $5 during grand opening. Talk about a cheap eat...  Black garlic shoyu ramen - Yet another thing I had during visit 1 that I ordered again visit 2. I have yet to figure out what's shoyu about this, but it takes like black garlic tonkotsu to me. Given that tonkotsu is their base broth, if I'm not mistaken, this makes sense. There's a definite garlic aroma coming off these noodles. Egg was softboiled. There were two very large slices of cha shu and they were tender and delicious. Grandpa's second favorite dish right here. I really like it because it's not as salty as ramen places. I can actually drink the soup here.  In hindsight, I regret not ordering more food. I should have gotten a ton of sashimi (botan ebi, anyone? scallops? uni?) Their mackerel was amazing my first visit. I also regret not ordering their okonomiyaki, and their black swan roll was unavailable during lunch, so I guess I'm going to be making a return visit soon!  Bonus for those who have read this far: Spider hand roll (softshell crab) is $3.99 regular menu. Good amount of crab. I'd ask for it without Cajun seasoning though."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for a late dinner. We were seated right away. Dare I say, the pressed sushi hit the spot. It was so good! I normally go downtown for pressed sushi, so I'm so glad I found one closer to work. I'm excited to return and try out some more of their food."}
{"text":"The restaurant is new and they are trying very hard, however, I have to describe our experience. The place is fairly small. The decor is simple and brightly lit. We were seated right away and drink orders taken. We soon realized that there was only one server and she was running. She was pleasant but just couldn't do it on her own. Eventually, after quite a wait, someone came from behind the sushi bar to take our order. When the food eventually came it arrived one dish at a time in some random order. So some of us were eating their mains while another hadn't got their salad...which eventually never came. They later offered to bring it for free. The domburis were good. The black cod and salmon not so much. As I said they are new and somewhat disorganized. Hopefully they'll get their act together. Perhaps we would give them another chance in a couple of months."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was also good. Very attentive and helpful. Salmon sashimi fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Came here on grand opening day, where all dishes were 40% off. Food was delicious and fresh, despite the small portion sizes. Tables were crammed. Felt like I was dining with the table beside us the whole time. The sashimi platter was a huge disappointment. It was the most expensive dish we ordered in our table. The sashimis were tiny, and came with cooked shrimp and crab sticks. Since when did crab sticks and cooked shrimp become sashimi? I thought the food was still expensive, even with the 40% off. Beautiful plating with the food though. Staffs were extremely friendly and pleasant. Might visit again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"They had an opening special so decided to come here with a few friends to check it out. The place is small with a seating capacity of about 25. I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki dinner. The chicken tasted a bit burnt and dry and did not have much flavor. Also ordered a bowl of Vegetable Ramen, and it tasted was average. Ambience was ok. Service was attentive with the waiter and waitress filling my cup of tea before it became empty.   My recommendation for the owner: Service was good. Need to improve quality of food and portion size. The teriyaki chicken was terrible."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and never been disappointed. Food tastes authentic, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. I particularly like the sushi and rolls here. Chef is very responsive to customer feedback and works hard. Glad to have this place in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here, and the shoyu ramen was bland and the rolls were falling apart. The noodles in the ramen were hard, and the portion was very small compared to dinning in. Do not order takeout from here. I ended up spending $50 on food we didn't end up eating."}
{"text":"My favourite Izakaya in GTA. I came here several times and always have a good experience.The price is reasonable and the service  is fast and attentive. The sushi are very fresh. My favourite foods are Tako wasabi and yakitori combo?BTW?if you have children ?you should order onigiri rabbit cartoon for them? That's sooooo cute?Words can not describe . I should take some pictures next time ?"}
{"text":"I thought Sushi Rock up the street had bad quality sushi until I ate at Kanda Izakaya. My god the sushi here is atrocious. I rarely throw away my food especially when it cost me $20 but the sushi set with spider crab, spicy salmon and spicy tuna was inedible. Honestly felt like I bit into sand when I ate those sushi."}
{"text":"We came here on opening week.   They were having a special price just to entice people to come in.  Well, I was disappointed.  We ordered a few izakaya to start us off.  The portions were small and I wouldn't pay full price for them.   This place is actually opened by chinese people but they hired japanese waiters.  We started off with the raw squid.  it was meh...  nothing special.  Then we got the 8 piece sushi roll and was disappointed.  The pieces are so small and tiny.  Then we got the taco yaki.  A disappointment as well.   I think they were frozen and not fresh.  Maybe bought from the local chinese grocery store?  The beef pieces were good.  but it was pricy at full price.  The seared fish alright as well.   Then came the pizza with japanese mayo.   It was alright.   The worst one was the fish pieces on a bowl of water. LOL!  wth was that?  10 little pieces of cooked fish pieces on hot water. what a joke.   The chicken karaage was alright.  Then the last izakaya dish was three tuna slices and three salmon slices on a dish.   full price was like $16 for it.  that's crazy!  there was someone across from us who got the same dish and they were pissed off.   She quickly told the chef they didn't want it and the chef got pissed off and said it was \"Chef Special!\"  LOL!!  I was still not full so I decided to get their tonkotsu ramen.  What a disappointment.   The soup was clearly not homemade and it was purchased somewhere else.  It kind of looked like manufactured tonkotsu broth from a package.  It was a joke.  I ended up complaining to the head manager and she ended up giving us a further discount.  I am not sure if they have improved or not but until they prove otherwise, my wallet is safe with me."}
{"text":"I just ordered from foodora. One of the ramen arrived with NO broth in the bowl, there was a hole a the bottom, so it leaked everywhere including into the broken okanamiyaki container, where a piece of the container is just missing.  Normally I would blame the foodora driver, but these are all issues that would have been caused at the restaurant. One of the salad's has literally only 5 small pieces of lettuce (I counted!)  and the garlic for the roasted garlic shoyu is all burnt, it's like a broth of charcoal.  Such a waste of money, I can't imagine eating in the restaurant would be any better considering this level of care they put into their food."}
{"text":"Even though the wait was a bit longer it gave me time for me to bond with my man...you can't blame em because it was their grand opening and all food items were 40% off.  We were really happy with the food served and the service was excellent!   Will definitely come back again when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"For a standard non-all-you-can-eat japanese restaurant, I expected a higher quality. I've been here a couple of times out of convenience whenever I've been craving cheap japanese food in the yonge-eglinton area, but I'm not sure if i'll come back again.   SERVICE: It's difficult to think of anything good or bad to say about their service. They don't really go out of their way to make sure you have the best dining experience yet there's nothing horribly wrong with their service although I do remember this one time where my friend and I were the only customers dining in the restaurant and it took quite a long time to get our bill as our server was too busy putting takeaway orders together. Maybe they're understaffed, I don't know.   FOOD: I'd like to say I've tried a good variety of their dishes, from tempura and takoyaki to their chirashi and maki rolls, and even their ramen. If I had to describe all of their food in one word, it would be mediocre. The sushi wasn't that fresh (the imitation crab wasn't even that good for imitation good standards) and the maki rolls were small. Their better quality foods ended up being their hot foods. The ramen was decent although salty, but their tempura and takoyaki were great minus the price.  Overall, while I can't say I'll be back for sure, it's likely that I'll give them one more shot to take advantage of their 15% off takeaway check-in order."}
{"text":"My recent visit to Kanda Izakaya was far below average, and it's a shame because the visits before that were great. My experience today lacked and it showed in their service and food.  My colleagues and I sat down after a table of 11 and we waited until they were finished ordering. Understandable. By the time they were done, we called on the server because we already knew what we wanted. The server never responded, brought in the next group of guests and proceeded to take their order a minute later.  It wasn't until food started coming out to the table until the server finally took our order...  Now, the food.  Soup was fine. Noodles were fine. The first thing I noticed right off the bat was the portion size of the pork belly. It looked like they tore off the meaty portion and left us with fatty leftovers. I rarely complain about the fat (because fat is flavour) but it was really chewy. It wasn't rendered properly.  And the egg was pretty alcoholic. Not what I was expecting. I can understand using a little bit, but I think it was heavy-handed.  I may consider revisiting, but that ask really comes down to if my colleagues are feeling it again."}
{"text":"Went a couple of times already since September. Food is great, especially there are so many varieties, from sashimi to sushi, from ramen to don, let alone all kinds of appetizers. The shoyu ramen is my favourite. Fuji mountain roll is also highly recommended. Definitely worth going for a quick meal, or friends gathering!"}
{"text":"Came here on the grand opening day (40% Off) and the experience was HORRIFYING.  Clearly they did not anticipate or have experience with a full house. Customers around looked pissed off about the poor service. Waiters were very apologetic and trying very hard. Fine, this part is understandable as they haven't seen so many people dining at their restaurant before.  The UGLY: Sashimi platter ($16.99) for that we got 3 pieces of salmon, 3 pieces of tuna, 3 pieces of frozen shrimp and 1 piece of squid wrapped up, where inside there is another 2 strands of squid only millimetres in width. If you do the math, that sure adds up to 12 pieces except it is not worth $17. I called the waitress over to which she returned it back to the kitchen, next thing i know is i got additional strands of imitation crab sticks. I have not seen a restaurant that serves floury crab sticks as sashimi, this one is a first. The chef stormed out of the kitchen and emphasized in an angry tone: \"You get Chef's selection, it's not up to you\". Okay... I guess the chef here is not so generous at all.  Baked oysters ($8.75?) Was served two large shells stuffed with mushrooms, mushrooms, cheese, more mushrooms, greasy oil, and about two tiny parts of the oyster. I know for fact that we didn't get the entire oyster. Where did the rest go?  Having bad service is one thing (understandable if you are busy), but thinking of ways to cheap out on customers is unethical. Even with the 40% off, I feel like both the quantity and quality was not worth it. I feel sorry for the customers that will pay for the full price. After this experience, i will most certainly not come back again, i'm sure many others feel the same."}
{"text":"2.5/5  Was craving sushi so wanted to try this place out as it's relatively new. After we picked up our sushi and was like 10 steps out the door, a guy chased after us and realized he got our order wrong and forgot to give us something. Sushi was all pretty meh... was pleasantly surprised it came with salad and miso soup though. Havent tried any of their other food so cant say if those are good or not...  but for sushi, I'd stick with lola sushi or sushi supreme which are both nearby."}
