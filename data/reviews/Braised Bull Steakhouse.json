{"text":"Very over rated. Food is not worth the high prices. Service was poor. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Three Med Dips - definitely not made fresh in-house. saw them scooping it out of a plastic container like you would get at a grocery store.

Soup, had the potato and leek - pretty bland... campbells would be ashamed. ouch!

The bread rolls were chewy.

Steak - Rare actually came out RARE!! woot! too bad they seared the steak on super high heat because all the peppercorns were burnt trogdor style....every bite had a perfectly burninating charred flavour.

sides - came with breakfast style 'potato cubes', one of them was particularly over-salted. winner."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday evening without a reservation with many tables available.  Once we were seated, after a short delay, we were given our menus and not served for almost 45 minutes.  It appears that a server was never assigned to us.  After our order was placed, we received our food but no follow-up other than the bill.  While I sometimes expect this sort of service at restaurants, I expected better for a 30 dollar/plate restaurant.  The food, however, was wonderful."}
{"text":"The chicken wings and mussels were great appetizers.  The ribs, steak and cod fish were all delicious.  The ribs fell off the bone, yummy.  Overall we were very impressed."}
{"text":"Great tasting steak, but it comes at a price. Expect to pay $30-50 a person here for dinner."}
{"text":"This is another restaurant that I been driving by for the last 20 years and never pay a visit! 

Finally after all these years, I now know what I have been missing!

We ordered the Carnivore Combo - For Two. That includes Caesar Salad, Mussels as appetitizer, 12 Oz Striploin, 8 Oz Grilled Salmon and 1 lb baby back ribs.

I usually don't like to eat Salmon when they are cooked only Sashimi, but I have to say that was the best Salmon I ate!

The steak was a great cut even for a striploin... in fact it has the effect of melting in your mouth tender.

All the food were prepared with special care. We saw how they prepared the food in the open kitchen...they were hand picking all the lettuce that's going into the salad!

Please leave room for desserts, as their dessert menu are actual desserts on a big plate  that they bring it to show you at your table! That is really hard to resist!

The services was great! Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Everything is possible with a great smile!

They have the $30 with 3 entrees special going on too!

I personally think  Braised Bull Steakhouse is way better in food quality and taste than The Keg and Canyon Creek and Montana. 

I would definitely be back for special occasion or when I have cravings for another cooked Salmon... YUM! can't believe that is healthy for me too!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall.

Been here a few times over last 2 years.  

Always happy with the red meat.   (I have a habit of ordering the specialty of a restaurant, meaning steaks in a steakhouse and seafood in a fish house).  

I recommend their calamari that comes in 2 flavors.  Tastes very, very good.

Services level varies a lot.  I suppose they hire a lot of part timers.  

SKIP the wine - over priced."}
