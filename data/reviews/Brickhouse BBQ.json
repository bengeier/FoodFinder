{"text":"I had heard good things about Brickhouse. My friend and went there on a Monday for dinner. It was pretty quiet.

We sat in a booth on the main level. Never again! The booth backs are loose, so every time the guy behind me leaned back, I got pushed forward. When he returned to the table after stepping away for a few minutes, he hit the back of the seat pretty hard and I got slammed forward. (I'm not blaming the guy here, the restaurant needs to fix these booths!)

The server didn't tell us that there were drink specials, until he brought them and let me know that my beer was on special. That would have been nice to know ahead of time though. It might have affected my friend's order. The waiter informed my friend that they were out of the beer she ordered (a hefeweizen) and suggested another one that he said was similar. What he brought was not a wheat beer at all, very hoppy and bitter. My beer tasted like garlic, as if they had made a Bloody Mary in the glass, rinsed it with water, and poured my beer. Pretty gross!

Also, there were a ton of gnats/fruit flies flying around, which was distracting and kind of nasty.

The meat on the pulled pork sandwich was good, but I wish their sauces tasted better. Fries were ok. My friend got a tiny bowl of beef chili, which she said was ok, but pretty brothy for chili. Overall, I thought the food was unimpressive, but not bad."}
{"text":"This BBQ place is really fun and has a great atmosphere. It is casual and has a great variety of different sauces and great mac and cheese! The ribs were not as good as I expected, but the food here is definitely worth trying! I love the pulled pork quesadillas! Try them!"}
{"text":"Love cannot even begin to describe what I feel for Brickhouse Barbecue. It's my favorite spot on campus for lunch, dinner, or a beer (they have over 40 on tap!) on the outdoor patio. The brisket sandwich is divine - tender steak topped with melted cheese and onion strings on a perfectly toasted bun. The sandwiches come with fries that are out of this world... they have some sort of batter that makes them extra crunchy. Dipping everything in Brickhouse's trio of homemade BBQ sauces takes the whole meal to the next level.  And did I mention the mac and cheese side dish? Cork screw noodles smothered in a cheddar cheese sauce and tossed with toasted panko bread crumbs. The portions are huge, the prices are low, and the food is scrumptious. It's a win all around."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times before and thought it was pretty good. Over time I have noticed a slight slip in quality of the food. This last trip for lunch sealed the deal for me and I will not be back. The first floor was about 1/3 full so it was not too crowded. We were a party of 4. Two ordered burgers and two ordered ribs. One ordered an appetizer that came with the meal instead of before the meal. The worst part was that it took 50 minutes to get our food and once it arrived for two of the people, it took 5 more minutes for the other 2 to get their food. The burgers were tasty as was the cornbread. The ribs were way overcooked and dry and had a slightly burnt taste. My guess is that they were cooked significantly earlier and then reheated on a grill. My collard greens were tough and too salty to eat. Not once during our wait did anyone come by and let us know that the kitchen was behind. No one ever asked how our food was after the wait. There are significantly better places to get BBQ than here."}
{"text":"Sides are the best!

The entrees and sandwiches can be hit or miss though.

A great atmosphere, beer list and really fun I'm the summer"}
{"text":"First off, read this with the understanding that it is a very new place and may not have hit its stride yet...

My brother and I are both native Texans.  We are very open minded about different types of BBQ and understand that there are a million variations of it...and we love them all!  LOL  

The above being said, the food served at Brickhouse can in no way be construde as BBQ.  My brother had the \"so called\" brisket sandwich which should be appropriately renamed as a roast beef sandwich...if that is actual brisket, they need serious lessons.  It was flavorless and dried out from being reheated improperly.

I had a sausage combo that claimed to be both cajun sausage and smoked sausage but they both looked and tasted identical and neither tasted great.  The sauces served along with the meals are good.  The sides are interesting and actually more flavorful than the main courses.  The one thing that I had that knocked my socks off was the lemon icebox pie...it was frozen solid and hard to cut but it tasted great.

As other reviewers have pointed out the atmosphere, selection, and service were are all very good.  There is a rooftop bar that hasn't opened yet but it looks like it might be a great hang.

Perhaps they should just tweak the name to \"Brickhouse\"?  Then people like me will relax about the BBQ thing.  LOL  After all, it is a beautiful place."}
{"text":"Always nice drinks and good food.  Pleasant staff as well.   If you're looking for something exotic,  don't come here.  It's a bbq place, so be expecting that.  They do a good job of it."}
{"text":"I can't give a rave review with the limited amount of info that we have, but, so far, this place is pretty much batting 1000 for us. Consequently, I won't take off any stars either.   Happened to feel the urge as we drove past at about 4 PM, so we stopped in.  No problems parking out front at that hour.  Place was almost empty, which suited us just fine.

Then I discovered that they have about 30 different beers on tap.  If you can't find something on their list, you probably don't like beer very much.

Tried the appetizer sampler, with ribs, duck drumsticks, Buffalo Wings, and onion rings.  Everything on that sampler was quite good to better than that.  They seem to know how to do bbq ribs  per wife, who is our expert.  Their selection of sauces is also just about  right, hitting the vinegar based, brown sugar based, and more spicy  types very nicely.

This joint is definitely good enough for a retest when we have the chance."}
{"text":"I came here for a pre-party during Great Taste of the Midwest 2012. Therefore, I cannot really comment on the food, as I was only here to drink. Their tap selection was awesome - they were hosting 3 fantastic out of town breweries. The space was gorgeous - loved the different levels and the view of the Capitol was breathtaking. I would definitely return for some grub!"}
{"text":"The chicken wings were just blah. I got the original bbq and I swear there wasn't even any sauce on them. Dry. My fries tasted like the sweet potato fries they were probably cooked right next to. All that and delivery takes over an hour and they 4$. Not really worth it; maybe the restaurant experience is better."}
{"text":"Service was fine. My catfish sandwich was fine, I sure didn't taste anything spicy on it. The beer selection was well above average. The highlight for me was the chili. Very hearty and very meaty...real chunks of beef. None of that ground beef gunk."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch (on a Saturday) and was pleasantly surprised as soon as we walked in.  From the outside the place looks, well, not like a great BBQ would look like.  Maybe it just looks too new.  The inside however was very appealing.  Very clean with a brick wall and nice wood work.  As soon as you walk in, you can see lot's and lot's of interesting beers on tap (they have 20-30 on tap).  My group was already ordering before I got halfway through the tap list.  I \"settled\" on a fat tire as to not hold up the works.  The other folks tried a variety of local beers and they all reported favorably.
I had the chicken wings and found them delicious.  They were very smokey and the sauce didn't overwhelm  Al the other folks got pulled pork sandwiches and all enjoyed them. I wish I had more time/meals here in town to try more of their food and beer."}
{"text":"Service was really bad.  Completely under staffed. Out of pulled pork. What type of BBQ joint sells out of pulled pork?  And the food we did have was cold. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!   Came in for a quick lunch and ordered ribs. Stopped in once before and the Manager/Waiter was very pleasant and the ribs were good and also had an hour long very pleasant conversation in getting to know each other well. This time the ribs were fatty with little meat with the second visit and dry and cold food which I strongly feel it was done on purpose. To top it off the bartender was very mean from the first moment I sat down. Immediately he told me that he would be with me later in which I then asked for a menu since my parking meter was running short. He never offered me any utensils nor water. Was extremely unpleasant from the very beginning giving me the impression that I was intruding on his time. I asked to pay for my meal right away. Never thought about the strange encounter and the bartenders rudeness until he started yelling at me in front of other patrons at the bar and in the restaurant. . While I was reading my iPhone the whole time while waiting for my food to be delivered and to be eaten at the bar and I never realized that I was lacking in a good service but was being totally ignored instead.  Also I did not even notice how he never greeted me at the bar nor made any recommendations  towards my lunch selections.  Also I did not realize how fast and pushy he was asking for my order while he was at the cash register. Again no good service. Never smiled nor was pleasant in any way towards me, the customer. Very impersonal.  Later I was quite surprised to see a young woman bring my food 'out to go' in which my reply to her was that I never ordered my food 'to go'. The Waiter appearing visibly upset and snatched the bag of food out of her hand and rushed the food to,the kitchen while I'm hearing him in the kitchen complaining about me to the kitchen staff while I'm sitting at the bar with other patrons.
When the food was returned on a plate the food was then cold , the ribs were poor in quality of meat and extremely fatty. 75% fat and 25% meat  along with very dry and cold macaroni and cheese. The sweet potatoes were also cold. I then asked to be served a glass of water and utensils so I can eat the food. I got a good impression that he only wants to wait on his regular customers and friends. He made it very clear from the moment I sat down that he did not want to wait on me when I interrupted him while he was filling a glass of water for another.

I was going to let this all go by 'the wayside' until when my food was sitting on the bar cold and I had no water nor utensils. I then asked for utensils and water to drink while eating my cold dry and fatty food. It was at this time a younger customer who apparently is a friend of his sat next to me at the bar. He had no idea what transpired beforehand.  It was at this time this young male made a very negative statement aimed at me without having a clue what transpired beforehand since he was not present. I could not believe my ears and I asked him to repeat himself. I was right. He was being negatively intrusive which was none of his business. My response was that he did not know up to this point just what had transpired and that he should not intervene since he had no clue what just happened.  I told him that he now just started a bigger mess and that he should have stayed out of it

It gets better!
The bartender comes back to the bar and literally starts screaming at me telling me that he wants to kick me out of the restaurant. When I asked to speak to the manager and hoping it was the rational pleasant Manager I had an hour talk with last time I stopped in and he is originally from Appleton, I was then surprised to see another Manager in his place

This gets better!
When I asked the bartender to have the Manager come out per my request I heard the bartender literally screaming in the kitchen about the scenario with me who,is the  customer, who wants to eat at the bar and not food to go. I knew I was being set up since everyone there seems to be friends and little consideration favored upon the customers

The Manager came out to talk to me and was very biased. It was apparent that he was taking the side of his friend/bartender since He just heard his loud angry one sided statement.  I held my ground and told the shortened version of the facts since I was not being allowed to speak to explain in length.  At the same time while I was trying to RATIONALLY explain my side of the events the bartender was literally screaming at me the whole time for everyone in the restaurant to hear.  I even pointed out that he can exhibit so much anger at the customer, so how can he be employed as a bartender in the service industry?  He even lied in his version of events to try to sway his customers and staff.   And he was constantly interrupting me when I was talking

This is the ultimate #1 worst dining experience and #1 worst quality of food that I've tasted in my 60 yrs of eating. I do not recommend this place ."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Brickhouse Barbeque for the first time tonight! My partner and I arrived at 6:30 pm and were greeted by the hostess who told us that we would have a 30 minute wait. We were just glad to have the night off of work and so we didn't mind waiting at the bar and ordering drinks. It took the bartender 10 minutes to even say hello to us even though there were only 4 other patrons at the bar. My partner and I decided to be positive about the situation and go ahead and order two beers and two shots of patron. Shortly after we enjoyed our drinks we were told that our table was ready. When we sat down the waitress came over and greeted us but then went away for 15 minutes!!!!! She even took the order of the table next to us before ours and they were seated well after us. When she finally returned we ordered and then waited for the food to arrive. When the food came out it was cold and almost seemed like it wasn't fresh! My partner ordered the brickhouse mac and cheese and I had the pulled pork. The mac and cheese was TERRIBLE! It was cold, stale tasting AND it had no cheese on it! Our server came back 10 minutes later after we had been well into the meal and we explained how sad we were with the quality of the food. We were offered another meal but by this time we had been there for 2 hours and were simply annoyed. We were never offered to speak to management and in fact we seemed to be rushed out of the place. I have NEVER had such horrible service and food in Madison, Wisconsin. I think a meal from McDonalds would have been a more satisfying choice! After our dinner we decided to go to Dotty Dumplings Dowry where we were treated with respect and greeted from the moment we walked in until the time we left. 

Shame on you Brickhouse."}
{"text":"Beer selection was great. Sauces are refrigerated all the time. Use them with your meat and they instantly chill whatever you're eating with it. Sauces could use some refining as there isn't any a traditional sauce as a choice. The Hawaiian Pork and And brisket were more flaked then pulled. Dry more than juicy.  Have to say the best thing this menu has to offer is the beer. The Monday night bartender is overwhelmed with service at the bar as well as serving the group in the loft. He can't multi task and at one point disappeared with quite some time to step out and smoke a cig for about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Yuck. We were here in March and it was fabulous. Tonight it was just terrible. Fatty brisket. Cold food. Took 45 minutes to get and it was awful. Bathroom was not clean. Table was not wiped down. Not going back."}
{"text":"Gretchen was our waitress and she did a great job for a Packer fan. :-) This place was very nice and the food was great. I had the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and it was excellent. They give you a lot of food so expect to be fl when you leave. The beer selection was great."}
{"text":"First time there and it was well worth the trip. The brisket and Mac and cheese was great. Ordered the Hawaiian pork was not what I had expected. It was a little to spicy for my liking. Overall great BBQ spot in Madison and the pour on the bourbon was very generous. Definitely got three fingers worth. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Better than anticipated!  We came with a Groupon and I can't  wait to come back.  We started with the nachos with pulled pork and I was completely impressed.  The sauces were awesome and the atmosphere was chill.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"They said they would let a party of 15 eat on the rooftop. We arrive and they say they can't accommodate and put us in the back. They then end up putting us at two separate tables and bring food at two different times. We then had to ask for one of our entrees as they completely forgot one persons order. We go and talk to the manager and he has a huge attitude and is completely rude. Ok food and will never end up here again based on run around and service. This place is not worth coming too."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, and the one thing I can say is that it's consistently inconsistent.  Had rented a room here one time and the food and service were awesome, room was great and we've always talked about doing it again.

This evening though, not so much.  Beer and bourbon list is great, no doubt about that. Food was ok.  One of my biggest issues when going out to dinner is when my food comes out within 10 minutes of ordering.  I'm there to hang out a bit, have a drink, not to start eating after my first sip.  BBQ is cooked ahead, I get that as well.  If you are going to bring it out that quick, at least make sure it's hot!

All that aside, the food was good.  Had the brisket and pulled pork, green beans and sweet potato salad.  Pork/brisket were great and the sauces were awesome. Carolina sauce is something I'd love for home and the mustard is great as well.  Would get the beans again...and again..and you get it.  

We will definitely go again, not doubt about it.  May just try something they cook to order."}
{"text":"Went with my main thot. We each got the brisket entree. The sides were pretty good, but the meat was lackluster at best. Sorta dry and flavorless on its own. Nothing like the south. Very very good sauces though, they saved the day. I very much liked the aesthetic of the place. The service was quite good, the waitress was super chill with us being clouded.

Everything was great except for the main thing."}
{"text":"I like this place. The brick house burger is really good, the service is good as well. I like  its corn bread very much although it's just a side dish"}
{"text":"Waited 43 minutes for food. Was not busy when we walked in. No apologies. Others were served ahead of us. Many choices nearby. Choose wisely."}
{"text":"Stopped at brickhouse while visiting Madison for the first time. There was a great selection of Wisconsin beers on tap. We ordered the catfish sandwhich which was delicious and also tried the pulled pork sandwich which was great too. Our server was friendly and helpful. Very pleased and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Brickhouse Barbeque is one of my favorite restaurants to go to in Madison.  I always start out with their nachos topped with tender beef brisket, they are to die for.  I also always get their turkey blt, the avocado and roasted tomatoes really take a basic sandwich and make it fabulous. You are always greeted by a friendly staff and a warm environment.  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The service was slow as the hostess didn't seem to do anything and couldn't even take the money for the bill.  Had to wait around for the bartender.

I had a full rack of ribs and mac and cheese.  My wife had the Mac combo of ribs, pulled pork and brisket.  Quite honestly, my mac and cheese was cold and had maybe a teaspoon of the baked on crust praised on the menu.  The ribs were good but certainly not the best I've had.  My apples were mush and the cornbread stale and hard.  I sate the ribs and left the rest.  My wife was disappointed with the brisket and pulled pork and didn't eat the apples or the cornbread.

After complaining to the waiter, he took her drink off of the bill!#$%. And although the atmosphere is nice, I don't think that we will go back there again.  Certainly not on her birthday!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the food is very good. The outdoor patio is a great addition to Madison this summer."}
{"text":"I very, very rarely write in to Yelp, but I feel like I need to be the tie-breaker on this one, as the reviews are wildly divergent.

There are two possibilities for this place.  Either

a) it entirely depends on when you are here

or

b) people don't know what good BBQ is here in Madison.

Now, I live in NYC now, so I'm a bit food-spoiled.  But I love BBQ, so my standards are pretty low.

This was not good BBQ.  I had the full ribs, with mac & cheese, succotash.  Sides were alright, nothing to write home about.  The ribs were overcooked and dried out, and were intolerable on their own.  Sure, if you slather them in enough BBQ sauce, they taste alright, but so does cardboard.

Don't go.  Overly expensive (at least by Madison standards) and just flat out not good BBQ."}
{"text":"Good $5 prices on quite a few taps, good service and no tax on the beers which for this Minnesotan was a nice surprise, an even $10 check.  Food looked and smelled good, but we didn't have anything, people around us had quick service.  My girlfriend liked the colorful globes above the bar."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about, but still the nicest place for a student to take their parents if they live in the high-rises across the street and don't want to walk more than 2 minutes in 15 degree weather.

The menu features classic BBQ choices such as pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and burgers. They recently added to their menu so those seasoned patrons can mix it up a little.  Portions are good and while prices are a little high, everything seems to be cooked fresh.

Try the mac and cheese as a side, especially delicious and one of the best mac's I've ever had. Also they have 40 beers on tap and a whole menu page dedicated to brandy, whiskey, and bourbon.

As for the service: it sucks. Plain and simple. They quote wait times for tables at 20 minutes than end up being closer to 45. Once you are seated it takes another 10 minutes to place a drink order, and food sometimes takes upwards of 45 minutes from order until it's at your table. If it's a weekend and you have plans even 3 hours from when you get there to eat plan to get to your destination quickly, as you're going to cut it close."}
{"text":"Three strikes and your out! I gave this place three chances! Each time the food was horrible and I let the waiter know. No one cared or did anything. I am SURE that this food is microwaved and then served to you! It tasted old and dry! I ordered BBQ platter and everytime the meat tasted like it was sitting there all day. Sweet potato salad is served cold which is fine but why are the potatoes hard as rocks??? I asked the server and he said that is just how they do it! Seriously? Well tell people who order it, because that's not normal and I would have appreciated knowing that info! The waiter said everyone complaines about that side dish for the same reasons! WOW! The only nice thing I can say is that the building is beautiful, and there seems to be a ton of space. How this place has stayed in business for a year is mind blowing!   Double Gross is what I give this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went with 3 coworkers over lunch today. It was the slowest service ever. Maybe it was just our waiter, though, because the table next to us arrived after us, ate, and left before us. 
All 3 of us agreed that the food was just OK. The \"spiced apples\" were essentially chopped, crunchy apples mixed in a spiced apple sauce."}
{"text":"I've eaten quite a bit of BBQ, and this was a disappointment.  The brisket was tough, to say the least.  The staff was friendly, and our waiter was quite funny.  At the same time, the beer selection was impressive.  However, the food itself was seriously lacking.

I would recommend it as a place to stop in and have one of their many beers - but hen again there are many other places nearby to do that in Madison.  Other BBQ places in town, chain and non-chain alike do a better BBQ.  The Haze will end up puttinf this place out of business if the BBQ does not improve."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Mac n cheese as a side was amazing with a plentiful serving. The turkey and brisket were alright, but I prefer sliced brisket to chopped. The server could have improved, but she seemed new."}
{"text":"I've both dined in and ordered online from Brickhouse. If you do go there to eat, sitting out back once it's warm out was awesome (even if maybe our service was a bit slower). The food and the BBQ specifically is good; certain plates on our table were better than others and I like the option of having 2 kinds of BBQ (2 meats) for a reasonable price so that you can try a few things. Our group did a lot of strategically different ordering and sharing of both meats & sides with this option. The pulled pork was great for sure. Ordering online was not nearly the same experience so if you must crave BBQ from your couch, go for it, but it's not nearly as fun as actually going to Brickhouse and smelling the deliciousness from the kitchen itself."}
{"text":"Lousy service... Literally charged us for things we didn't order and argued with us when it was time to pay the bill... And wouldn't change the amount 

Will never go there again because of terrible customer service 

A shame... The food was actually really pretty good"}
{"text":"Ask me after my first visit, 5 stars.  It is too hit or miss.  They have some great cooks, and some mediocre ones.  I loved the chicken, portabella, tri tip, and catfish sandwiches on different occasions.  Fries are decent and mac n cheese was great.  The ribs were the firm style, not the moist, falling off the bone type I like.  I think that should be noted on the menu.  The past couple times, the mac n cheese was cold and unseasoned.  My mom's chicken sandwich was burnt.  The nachos were put together worse than a Taco Bell.  There was a huge, haphazard chunk of pork, another of sour cream, etc.  It really felt like they didn't give a s***.  I was also interested in having an event here prior to the last experience.  The hosts on 2 different occasions gave me the wrong email address.  I thought that I was being ignored but the events manager cleared that up.

Tl;dr.  Great rooftop, food is hit or miss.  At best, great.  At worst, not likely to come back."}
{"text":"We came in expecting to enjoy a selection of three beers on Thursday for Kill the Keg. We'd heard great things from friends and were excited to experience Kill the Keg. We were very disappointed to discover to learn that it was moved to a much worse night, Wednesday when we came in. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner for my bachelor party and was very dissapointed. After our second round of drinks they took away all drink menus and then rufused to get us anymore drinks. The food was mediocre and took far longer than it should have. Then when it came to the bill, they charged my two drinks on three different bills for the full price as well as charging $1.50 for ice in a cocktail. Very dissapointing and I will never give them another chance for how we were treated."}
{"text":"Yeah...I remember why I don't eat here.

This is another one of those barbecue places where they just give you plain meat and expect you to figure out what kind of sauce you want. Only they don't tell you what the available sauces are. (Seriously - none of the bottles on our table were labeled.) When I order pulled pork (especially if it's topping an order of mac-n-cheese), I expect it to be sauced when I get it. Have you ever tried to sauce meat on top of mac-n-cheese without also saucing the mac-n-cheese? It doesn't work. And a main component of mac-n-cheese should be...wait for it...cheese. Something they (apparently) don't believe in at Brickhouse.

Our waitress was befuddled - and mostly absent - from start to finish. She told us she was new, so we tried to be understanding. But three of the four old-fashioneds ordered at our table (Korbel and Templeton rye - two rounds of each) were made incorrectly. As in...bourbon instead of Korbel in one of them, and who knows what was in either of the second-round drinks. I don't know if that was a server miscommunication or a bartender mistake, but it was absolutely ridiculous. Fortunately, we ordered the second round after we had paid for dinner, so we were able to just send the drinks back and move on to another venue.

In this case, permanently."}
{"text":"I've stopped going here because every time I do I feel neglected and rushed. Basically service sucks, and I've only gone when it's not busy so service should be better. The food is okay, good size portions but I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a pint and a meal.  Was warmly greeted and promptly served.  The food was done perfectly and the taste was absolutely perfect.  Oh and they have trivia on Tuesday night which is an absolute blast.  Come to the Brickhouse you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Grossest beef brisket sandwich ever!! It was totally smothered in melted cheese so I couldn't see it at first, but one bite into it I realized it was mostly fat, no meat. I took it home so I could try to eat the meat out of it, but after picking through it, I found it maybe, at most, 10 % meat, 90 % fat. My wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich - that was quite fatty too, but not nearly as bad. Her coleslaw side was very bland, but well shredded, fresh & crisp. The white sandwich buns would've been much better if they'd been buttered & toasted. My seasoned/coated fries, ordered crispy, were nicely crisp & some of the better fires I've had in recent memory. Service was adequate, & the place appeared clean, although it was quite dark inside during our lunch visit. Why didn't I complain? I was using a Groupon coupon, so I didn't want to appear too cheap, but we would definitely never go back to this place!"}
{"text":"At first, I really thought I was going to love this restaurant. 
The decor was trendy, inviting, and had plenty of space. (I'm sure when the weather is nice, the outdoor seating is a huge plus, too)
The drink menu looked interesting and had a large selection of hand selected beer on tap that the manager told us is updated monthly. Everything on the menu looked great; there were also a ton of great looking sides. Even the menus themselves looked good.
And obviously, who doesn't love BBQ?

Our beer came - I had the Bourbon Barrel Stout which is now very high on my favorite beer list. This dark beer had a ton of flavor but was not too heavy. Sarah also had a really good honey beer.

Then things started to go downhill.  
We passed on appetizers b/c the entrees came with two sides. And although we were watching the game and not in a hurry, the food was quite slow. Our manager/waiter told us we just happened to get behind two large tables...No problem, however this was the first day of spring break on campus and the place was less than 1/3 full - how do they keep up on full days? 

When the food came, overall it was average. The positives:
1. Mac n cheese - top notch
2. The three sauces: A BBQ place can be made or broke by its sauces. A molasses based, a vinegar based, and a mustard BBQ were all different and very good. And complemented the different meats well.

Negatives:
1. They serve the cornbread cold. Who does that?? It would have been pretty good, but I've never eaten cold cornbread!
2. My \"Spicy green beans\" were not spicy and were too crunchy - not even al dente.
3. Sweet potato salad although looked nice, the potatoes were also not evenly cooked. Some tender, some almost raw. Would have preferred if served warm.
4. All the \"hot\" food was just above warm and cooled off way to fast, possibly because it was quite cold in there. They may consider heating the plates, getting the food out quicker, or something else creative.

I had the meat combo: Chose the sausage and pulled pork. The sausage came with one spicy and one smoked served with pickled peppers. Pulled pork was good, but not amazing. Sarah had the chicken - moist and pretty good.

(Since I'm a sucker for dessert,) I finished off with the pecan tart because the manager said they have their own pastry chef. Well, there were only 4 desserts on the menu, which made me feeling like that chef is probably overpaid, but... Anyway, the tart came and was OK, but again, served cold. Everyone knows pecan pie is best warm. The custard that it was supposed to be served with, was nothing more than a smear of melted custard - yikes!!

Overall, we left feeling the food - which actually makes the restaurant - was just A-OK. However, we'll maybe come back to try out the outdoor seating in the summer."}
{"text":"Not at all my favorite. I can cook better BBQ at home. The place is ENTIRELY too loud. We got sat about 2 feet behind 3 people sitting at the bar and had to pull our table over so we didn't feel like were sitting on top of each other. If I ever visit Madison again I will not be stopping here!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from this restaurant with high expectations.  The pulled pork sandwich with fries and cheese grits were great.  The pork was very smoky and the cheese grits were rich and creamy.  However, my \"bowl\" of $5.50 chili came in an 8 oz container (the same size as the side of corn grits), and while good, was definitely not the filling portion I had expected and did not come with any garnishes.  Further, my side of green beans was shriveled and had obviously been sitting for a long period of time.  Maybe we'll try it again, but it's not at the top of my list after so much disappointment."}
{"text":"Came in for beer only and the menu is great! If you're into hard-to-craft craft brews, this is worth a look see. The service was fast, seating was plentiful and the bar was clean."}
{"text":"Hmm... after further review, I feel I need to be more critical. We didn't finish everything last night, so I can back for seconds this evening. Here are the final results:
The ribs were so full of fat, they were virtually inedible. It was hard to see all the fat through the dry rub caked on it. Again, no signs of ever having been smoked, either in flavor or color. I actually had a few bites of the ribs and tossed them. If you know me, tossing ribs is sacreligious.

The brisket sandwich. Brisket? It tastes like the onion strings or rings or whatever they covered all the brisket in. After extracting the layers of fried onion strings, I tried the sandwich again... and guess what folks - the brisket had no flavor. I had to put BBQ saue on the brisket sandwich to get some taste in it.

I'm not sure what Brickhouse is going for here, but it does make me sad to give a bad review. Maybe it was a bad day for them? I'll try again one of these days... but not any time soon.


Fourteen years ago,  friend and I walked around the downtown Madison area in a fruitless search of anything barbeque... chicken, ribs, riblets, even the fake shit, smoked and slathered in sauce would have sufficed. Anyhow, 14 years later, someone came up with the brilliant idea of opening a barbeque joint on campus. It's a nice looking spot, and it appears to have a variety of different beers and liquors in addition to their BBQ, also nice to see in the campus area. Unfortunately, the BBQ itself was so so. I expected far better, but then again, I've always said that expectation is the king of all let down. The other criticism is that for the campus area, the pricepoint is pretty damn high. I know decent BBQ doesn't come cheap, but you also have to consider your location. If you are wondering, we had the ribs and a brisket sandwich. The ribs were okay, and I didn't see any of the telltale signs of having been smoked. They were chewy, which some people like - I don't. The brisket sandwich was rich and also lacking in flavor. The mac n' cheese was pretty basic - lacking in flavor. The chipotle smoked sweet potato salad was interesting, and the french fries - well how can you screw those up? Those were decent. Service was adequate and there was plenty of seating when we went. If I'm going to drop a couple bucks on BBQ, I'm going to pass on the ambiance of the downtown/campus area, and head over to Smoky Jon's."}
{"text":"Went yesterday and they said they were under new management. There's only 2 entrees, 3 sandwiches, and 5 sides on their little temporary menu. The window said they had ribs but apparently not last night. 3 of us got the brisket and one the pulled pork. They were all thick sliced and not real tender. The brisket was a pretty fatty and just ok. The fries - waffle cut and sweet potato - were very good. The cole slaw was so so. It's a nice place inside, but hope they can improve."}
{"text":"This place has a really clean, modern atmosphere. I went there a couple times the week it first opened with three friends from the Carolinas and they were quite ecstatic to finally find decent BBQ and sweet tea in Madison. I always leave with my meat craving satisfied.

Service is always friendly, but don't expect to be in and out in half an hour. It's not that type of joint. Drinks are better than average for Madison too."}
{"text":"Did not intend to eat there, but got caught in a rain storm and it was nearest available spot. They are having issues with their tap system so, as others have noted, the beer was a bit warm and the selection was not as large as it typically would be. I had the shrimp and polenta dish and it was excellent, as was the side of spicy green beans."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place but. . .    Food started out good with the pulled pork quesadia which was very good.  Lots of flavor and juicy.  Came with sour cream and some spicy salsa.  

But then dinner came. If it hadn't been for the appetizer, this place would have only gotten 1 star.   I had the flatiron steak which would have been good if cooked to medium.  It arrived more well done.  I was going to send it back but my spouse told me to just eat it.  Not much flavor and the BBQ sauces that were brought out to us didn't help much.  One was a molasses based sauce that was way too sweet.  Then a vinegar sauce which was too sour and a mustard sauce that might as well been a bottle of Grey Poupon.  I like Grey Poupon, just not as a BBQ sauce.

Worse were the ribs that my wife got.  VERY dry to the point of being crispy.  Talk about a waste of good meat.  Some of the worst ribs I have ever tasted.  

I was so hoping this would bring Madison a good BBQ place but it doesn't make the grade."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Brickhouse. To me, high quality meat is what makes great BBQ, and Brickhouse does it right. The pulled pork and brisket are really delicious, and the mac & cheese is really good too. Definitely try the mustard-style BBQ sauce on your pulled pork, even if it sounds weird (most northerners don't associate mustard with BBQ, but I appreciate the fact that Brickhouse has a good selection of regional sauces). Also, the jalapeno cornbread is to die for.

Another thing that really impresses me about Brickhouse is their great selection of bourbons and other whiskeys. They actually stock Pappy Van Winkle's, which makes me really happy - but also really frustrated since I can't not drink it, and of course it's just as expensive as everywhere else (naturally - but so worth it). Try the flight that includes the 10 year!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Except the macaroni and cheese was a little cold. The hostess was not at the stand for a noticeable time and had us waiting."}
{"text":"Yelp is right on this one. 

SLOW service on a SLOW night (multiple times to ask for one drink, brought one drink at a time, mixed up tickets, missing items, slow refills, etc...)
Dry pork sandwich
Brisket was chewy
Sauces were not good, nor helpful
Boring mac and cheese
Didn't have the beer I wanted (even though there is a big draft selection: many IPAs)
Chicken wings were not habanero, nor very spicy
Green beans were RAW and also not \"spicy\" at all


Only good: 
Turkey was moist, mild smoke flavor, still warm. Would ONLY get this again. Asked for the raspberry junk sauce on the side, never got it, glad I didn't. 2/5

On BBQ list, this place ranks 10th, which is last place."}
{"text":"We rented out the top floor for a wedding rehearsal. It was perfect- we rented the patio as well so it was only our guests allowed. The food was great and brought out timely. The bartenders were very nice and great with keeping track of the open bar tab. The bar staff also accommodated our requests to play a slideshow and music. We also ran out of apps so were able to place an order for more with no problem.
David, the manager, was very easy-going from the start. He is best by email and was very flexible. He even let my mom bring her cheesecakes in early for storage. They were great!"}
{"text":"Was just... alright. Many reviewers have it dead on. Great atmosphere and okay food. Definitely far from being what it could be. They need a new chef or someone to tell them how to property do BBQ. Cold corn bread? Ribs just okay, a little fatty and chewy. I got the two mean platter and it came with 1 half slice of ham that was 1/4 inch thick. Mac and cheese was great, but the beans and apple sauce were just okay. I want to like this place as I could be here weekly if they could do true BBQ."}
{"text":"Great outside patio! This is the second time I've eaten here and have nothing bad to say! The food and service is great and the atmosphere is wonderful. Definitely coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Hoooo, boy.  Where do I begin?  Let me start by saying that, while not native Southerners, the boyfriend and I spent the last several years living in Memphis, one of the BBQ capitals of the nation.  They take BBQ VERY seriously in Memphis, and it is everywhere.  After years of living around the corner from some of the best BBQ in town, we have been absolutely appalled at what passes for BBQ up here, and Brickhouse was Exhibit A.

Let me set the stage -- it was a hot Sunday afternoon, around 2pm.  Not a busy time; in fact, the beautiful, multi-floor restaurant was practically deserted.  Lured by the promise of a rooftop patio, we schlepped up the stairs, only to discover that, oddly enough, there were no umbrellas.  Those few brave patrons up there were baking in the sun, and not wishing to freeze in the air conditioning inside, we joined them...after I ran back downstairs, and up again, for sunscreen and a hat from the car.

Craving something cold and alcoholic at this point, but not being a beer drinker, I asked our waitress to tell me about the whopping 2 hard ciders on the menu (1 apple, 1 pear).  She mumbled something about not really knowing anything about them and settled for bringing me tasting portions from the bar.  Ok, fine.  I settled on the pear, and we ordered food.

Our fried duck wings eventually came out, and they were a disappointment.  If I hadn't known they were duck, I never would have guessed, and the overly sweet sauce they were served with didn't add anything.  And then.  And then.  Halfway through our appetizer, the waitress appeared with our entrees.  My pet peeve.  

Rather than send them back, and risk having them sit under a warming lamp in the kitchen, we made room on the table and dug in.  My pulled pork was not spectacular, and I didn't like any of the 3 sauces on the table -- all of them seemed to have a great deal of black pepper in them, and were somehow not quite an appealing consistency.  The boyfriend's ribs were a major disappointment, clearly having been braised or otherwise cooked without benefit of a smoker, which is the whole point of BBQ (he actually commented on entering the restaurant that he didn't smell their smoker, which is a bad sign -- no smoker means no true BBQ).  

His green beans, described as spicy, were not at all, and the final straw for me was discovering that my mac 'n cheese was cold.  Cold enough that I suspected that it had been the first thing put on the plate waaaay downstairs in the kitchen, waited for the rest of my food, and, by the time it made it up several flights to me, had died a sad, quiet death.  When I pointed this out to the waitress she brought me a fresh portion (which was actually hot), but may I remind you that the restaurant was practically empty?  And who serves cold mac 'n cheese??

At this point, having been roasting in the sun for an hour and been served a poor excuse for BBQ, we paid the $60 bill and left.  Asked on the way out how it was, I commented on the lack of umbrellas on the patio and was given a lame excuse about how they were replacing the worn-out ones.  Uh, could you keep the old ones til the new ones came?  So your patrons don't die out there?

So if this is \"the best BBQ in Madison,\" that is a very sad statement.  If you don't know what BBQ is, you might like Brickhouse, but please, stay away.  Far away."}
{"text":"Recently went to the Brickhouse barbecue in Madison Wisconsin. As much as I hate to do this, I'm giving a mixed review.

On the plus side, the selection of craft beers on tap is nothing short of amazing. It's clear that the bartender knows what he's doing and is able to make expert recommendations --very knowledgeable.  The other positive thing is that the meets are very well prepared. I have the brisket which was so tender it almost melted in my mouth. My guest had the pulled pork that was fantastic. The barbecue sauces varied from sweet to spicy -- nice selection.

The drawback were that the Side dishes were a disappointment -- although the spicy beans were Nice and spicy, they were overcooked. The cornbread was also over baked and dried out. To Make a complete meal excellent you got to cover all the bases with excellent food preparation."}
{"text":"Service was fast and food was great! Good BBQ flavor and sizable portions.  Full bar with a nice row of tap.  Atmosphere was casual and easy -"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try another barbecue place in Madison, after being disappointed with the last three! Had a fantastic meal tonight. The chicken was so tender it fell off the bone."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the rest of the reviews before coming here. 

We walked in and we're the only people there. Despite this fact, our food took close to 40 minutes to get after ordering. The excuse we were given was that there was only one cook due to food vendors being out on the square. I am not sure why the management would not increase the staff at the actual restaurant to accommodate this. Despite the fact that there may or may not have been only a single cook, it is a barbecue restaurant. Most of this meat has already been slow cooking for hours. There shouldn't have been much to prepare, and we were the only people in the restaurant. 

Moving on to the food, the brisket was good but the ribs were not. They were over seasoned and over cooked. Additionally, when I pay $16 for a BBQ platter I expect to see a plethora of meat. This was not the case. Lastly, the sauces they give are below average. There's only 3 options and none of them are standout. 

Overall, I would not recommend going here. There's about a hundred other restaurants on State Street that I'm sure beat this place out."}
{"text":"I'm not a big barbeque person, but I liked the food. I got the pulled pork sandwich. I'm a fan of the sauces on the side - mostly because I don't like barbeque sauce that much. Definitely not anywhere near the best, but it's reasonably priced. Plus, there's a huge selection of beers on tap. The sides are all very good - loved the cornbread and the grits.

Service: Meh. Nothing happened that would make me say it's bad, but I also don't remember my servers even checking on my table more than once.
Environment: The place is huge. I worried they would have trouble filling it, but the second time I went, it was packed and there was a 30 minute wait.

Background notes: went with a group of about 10 friends on a Wednesday night, also went with the family on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"This place in my opinion makes one of the top 3 burgers in Madison.  Cooked over a flame the Bacon Bourbon Burger with some sort of aoli on it is money.  However I have been moderately happy or disappointed every time I have ate the ribs (were smoked days prior), brisket or pulled pork.  If you stick to the burgers this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped by because of Madison Mag review. Bartender was very friendly and helpful. Place was fairly busy and everyone seemed friendly. Unfortunately the food was a disappointment. Ribs were tough, brisket dry and tasteless. Mac and cheese was closer to Mac, little cheese. Slaw was good, I would recommend it. I would come here to drink, love the atmosphere. Forgot to mention, the duck legs were very good."}
{"text":"I guess these guys had a staff party the night before, because 3 of their staff loomed around the bar complaining about being hungover while I waited for service. 

Service-ok
Food-ok
Beer Selection-Pretty good. 
Also they are right next to a great liquor store with a fantastic beer selection-Must go over there"}
{"text":"I had the beef brisket sandwich.  It was good and 
I would go there again and order it.  Having said that...

The brisket can't be ordered as just an entree, which made me skeptical about its quality, but the sandwich was alright.  The meat was tender, but not melt in my mouth tender.  The meat was a little too salty and didn't have enough of that beef fat taste.  The mustard sauce was good with it but took over the flavors too much (or the meat didn't have enough flavor to begin with?  The roll it came with was good/standard and the crispy onion strings on it topped it offed nicely.  The french fries came pre-seasoned and were cooked well.  

Big portion, friendly service, and yummy taste."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has so few stars. The food was really good. Now, I typically like my BBQ sauces to hit me a bit more, but that's a personal preference. I mixed the mustard and original sauce and liked the result. But the pulled pork is so delicious that you can eat it without any sauce, and the beans were really awesome (though I would have preferred spicier) and collards were good too. 
And as for the service: wow! The waitress was super attentive, even with juggling several other tables. The bartender did a great job recommending some rye whiskey for me, and even sent over some van winkle when they didn't have one of the ryes that came with my flight. The prices were very reasonable as well. They even have several teas to choose from, which was a surprise at a BBQ place. Definitely will be coming back.

Oh, and I think it's awesome that they have a unisex bathroom."}
{"text":"A group of friends dined here one evening as Brickhouse BBQ was a venue for \"Paint Nite\".  I was pleased with the large variety of beers to choose from. I choose a seasonal local beer, and I could have sworn I wasn't given the correct beer as it didn't taste like it.
I ordered the Brisket sandwich. I liked that they had 3 different BBQ sauces to choose from on the table, you can choose which one you like best and use as much or as little sauce on your sandwich as you like. My sandwich was supposed to come with coleslaw on the sandwich which it didn't so the waitress had to get some from the kitchen. The meat on the sandwich was tender, but it was swimming in grease. The bottom of my bun was quickly soggy from all the grease.  The service overall was sub par (they were not busy either when we were dining)
Overall it tasted OK. As far as dining here again? I could take it or leave it."}
{"text":"This isn't a bad place to get a burger, but you're really much better off going to Dotty's around the corner or even Five Guys up on State if that's what you're looking for. The meat is obviously pressed.

I decided to give the ribs a try one night, but wasn't too impressed. They were pretty dry and difficult to eat. The sauce was lacking, but you will always get brought a plate full of interesting signature sauces to top your food with.

I love the mac and cheese here. Incredibly cheesy, large elbows cooked to exactly the right toughness/softness, and topped with a delicious blend of spices and bread crumbs. The coleslaw is extremely bland, and should be avoided. French fries were your average thin cut with an average seasoning salt, nothing you couldn't get anywhere else. Get the fried onion strings on anything and everything that you can get it with - they're excellent thanks to a crispy and well-seasoned batter.

Service is standard good, which is sometimes a hard thing to get in Madison. The wait staff is friendly and will be happy to immediately get you anything you need. The atmosphere is also pretty nice, with a pleasant patio out back and nice hardwood floors and brick walls inside.

All in all, I've had extremely average dining experiences in here. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to try it, but take a look at their menu. If you're looking for something in particular, it might be worth a shot."}
{"text":"I like the food, but my husband is less of a fan.  The real issue is the service - it is unreasonably slow and more often than not incompetent with dishes being served late, cold, or just plain wrong.  It's a pity because like I said, I like the food..."}
{"text":"Holy Mac N Cheese 

If you've had it...you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't.. you need to. I'm not going to be snobbish to the point that I'll say I've grown out of mac n cheese. Having established that, I'd like to think myself a connoisseur of the delicacy. Brickhouse's Mac N Cheese was quite possibly the best I've ever had, and I've had a lot of it.  

I rounded off the meal with the Brisket, which was also very good. Our waiter was a decently nice fellow, and nothing to complain about. 

I really liked the environment of the place, but it seems as if they're struggling to find their identity still. 

All in all, it was a 3.5-4.5/5 and I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place seems to garner a lot of mixed reviews, but luckily for me, I had a great experience here this past Saturday.

To start off with, our waitress was extremely friendly and accommodating, and really knew her alcohol (always a plus).

I was rather surprised by their large and interesting selection of beer, given that it's a BBQ place. 

I was feeling adventurous, and went with their Founders Dirty Bastard. You're already getting a pretty good deal for the price ($5) to alcohol ratio (8.3%), and it only gets better when you realize it doesn't taste like crap. It tasted like any dark ale to me, so there's not much to complain.

My friends went with the WTF (tastes kinda like warp speed) and Ace Berry Cider (tastes kinda like berry juice, aka for pansies); 

Aside from the beer, their BBQ's pretty good too :p

They have 3 delicious sauces available, and you can get as many refills as you want.

I ordered a Brickhouse Brisket entree, which is smoked brisket laid over a piece of toast, all served with cornbread and 2 sides. Now that may sound like a lot of food, but... never mind, who am I kidding. It's a lot of food. You're definitely going to be full.

Their beef was pretty tender, but didn't really stand out much besides that. I also wish they had more meat, and maybe less starch, but I'm over it.

What's ironic is that instead of their brisket, which should be the best part of ya know, a BBQ dish, it's their sides that truly shine. The cornbreads might be my favorite part, because not only is it sweet, it also had bits of jalapeno(?) to give it a kick. 

The toast was also great, as its crunchy texture really added some needed pizazz to the meal. I got a side of crisp and spicy green beans (meh) and braised collard greens & ham (better than meh).     
 
So overall, a pretty filling meal with a variety of taste, more good than bad :)"}
{"text":"One star for the great beer selection. They use the work \"smoke\" a lot but I don't know why. You will notice that you never smell smoke inside or outside this place. They must not have a smoker or it was off line when I was there. Smoked chicken wings? No smoke. Ribs and brisket? No visible evidence of smoking used in the cooking process. Most likely used smoke flavoring in sauce or marinade/rub. Looking for authentic smoked BBQ? Look elsewhere. Very disappointed and will not be back. Wasn't even a good fraudulent attempt."}
{"text":"We tried Brickhouse BBQ for dinner this past weekend. What stood out was that this is a three story restaurant and the top floor includes an outdoor eating patio. With three stories, Brickhouse can accommodate a lot of patrons. We were there on a Friday night around dinner time. It was not particularly busy. All of that space made it seem almost empty. We opted to eat outside, on the third floor patio, where you can look down on the street and across to the surrounding buildings.

Our waitress was friendly, not particularly knowledgeable about the extensive beer list, but perky and likeable. The beer list is not only extensive but reasonably priced.

The menu included some oddities such as duck legs, various styles of Mac & Cheese including Cajun and chipotle, and appetizers like the trio of fries which included potato, sweet potato and zucchini. I give it props for variety and originality. I ordered the smoked turkey and my partner had the sausage combo. The turkey was moist, tender, and already sauced so I didn't need to add any of the additional sauces available at the table. It comes with corn-bread which I found dense and grainy but I did enjoy the sweet crust on top. For sides I ordered the braised collard greens with ham and maple mashed sweet potatoes. The saltiness of the ham complimented the bitterness of the greens. I didn't get much maple in the sweet potatoes.

I really liked being able to sit outside on the roof, the food was tasty and unusual and the service was fine. I would go back."}
{"text":"When I have been here, I was not very impressed.   The meat lacked good color and texture.  I found the sauces were designed to mask the flaws of the meat.  I might be being too harsh but as someone who loves BBQ this is not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"The pork and brisket were depressingly bland. No salt, no fat, and no smoke flavor. I've had better pot roast. The sides were just as an unimpressive."}
{"text":"When the Mac is good, it's the best in town - but at times they don't put enough cheese on it so it turns out like buttered noodles. Other than the Mac, which is my favorite item on the menu, the food is pretty good, definitely not great. They have an excellent selection of brew though and and VERY friendly staff which keeps me coming back.

The third floor is also a sick place to host a group event, if you're in to that kind of thing. Oh, and in the summer the roof deck is a chill spot to kick it."}
{"text":"Great portions. Ribs were a bit dry but good. Amazing price though. The Mac and cheese was delicious and so were the potatoes"}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting Brickhouse and had another great time. This is the kind of BBQ place that you add your own sauce. Spicy and/or Sweet as you like it. The sides were fresh and a good compliment to the meal. They have a HUGE selection of local microbrews on tap.  The waiters helped a lot here and brought us se samples to help us select."}
{"text":"I think this place is generally underrated. I've had BBQ in Memphis, KC, and I spent a year in STL and ate at all the best places there. Brickhouse isn't the nut high, but it's not an embarrassment either. 

Get the: 

Cornbread (moist! some of the best), Cajun Sausage, Chimichurri Steak (such flavor, cooked perfectly), Mac and Cheese, Garlic Smashed Mashed Potatoes (incredible). 

Avoid the: 

Ribs (lol), Spicy Green Beans (aka normal green beans),"}
{"text":"Good Lord. Ignore the reviews by the college kids. They expect everything to taste like perfection and have the staff wipe their mouth after every bite.

My girlfriend and I had just come back from doing some hiking on a brisk day and needed something to fill and warm us up. We both ordered the Brickhouse Mac & Cheese. Sounded like a perfect blend of cheesy pasta with pulled pork, brisket and two bones of ribs. It also comes with a side of cornbread. 

The pasta was delicious and the ribs were cooked perfectly. The brisket was a little scarce but overall it was a fantastic dish. 

It was a Friday afternoon and only a few people were dining. We were acknowledged right away  when we came in and our waiter frequently came by to check on our food and drinks. 

Only complaint of this place? The barbecue sauces on the table weren't labeled and golf was playing on TV. Other than that I highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection and decent food. The BBQ pulled pork is always a favorite. Two thumbs up for the catfish sandwich and the 1/2 lb. burger, but don't order the chicken chili - gross! The good food made up for the terrible service. Our waiter was stressed out because they were understaffed during the rush before the Men's basketball game. I kinda felt bad for his situation, but he was very unprofessional and just plain rude. We love the roof-top terrace in the summer, so we might be back in when it's warmer."}
{"text":"Engaging service thanks Phil.  Enjoyed the food.  The only issue was the size of the booth.  Kinda small for four people."}
{"text":"been there twice. had ribs once, and steak once.  thought it was above average both times and very delicious sides and  beers"}
{"text":"This place has everything to be a successful establishment--great food, good tap list, rooftop seating, great specials, and good prices. I've been a few times, and I want to really like this place. Unfortunately, although service is very nice, it is extremely slow, and taps were quite warm, which was off-putting.  With some tweaks, this place could be great, but I'm not sure that I'll go back."}
{"text":"Um wow I had really high hopes the place is well decorated , cloth napkins, nice decor but it was a fail on every level. I joined a group for dinner, wasn't asked if I wanted a beverage as water was on the table. I ordered the brisket with fries and coleslaw and there  really wasn't hardly anything edible on the plate. The brisket was literally stone cold served in a piece of cold bread, not like it had sat for a while but like so cold it had been refrigerated and then served. The fries were all coated in a super spicy seasoning so much that you couldn't even taste the potato, also cold fries. The coleslaw hi we're was not cold it was very unique that the meat get colder than the coleslaw. The server never really showed up except to deliver food and then the check. I love bbq and am sorry to say the mc rib had better barbecue flavor than this brisket."}
{"text":"Went here for a group dinner.  First walking in, things at least smelled promising (ahhh, the smell of smoked bbq).  Alas, the meat did not hold up to the promise.  On offer we had ribs, pulled pork and some sort of beef (steak medallions or something like that).  Pulled pork was rather dry and less than tender (and there was no bbq sauce to go with it).  I didn't have the other 2 meats, but multiple others in our party did and everyone was less than impressed with the quality of the meat (kind of important for a bbq joint).

We also had cheese curds, salad, potato salad, mashed potatoes and sweet potato fries (guess they must have a stockpile of potatoes).  I didn't have the salad, but both the mashed and sweet potato fries were delicious.  The cheese curds were subpar (everyone also thought the same...they tasted like they were over-fried and had been sitting around for awhile).

Then for dessert there was a turtle cheesecake -  AWESOME!  but, they didn't have enough for the whole group?!?  When we asked for more so everyone could have some, we were told there wasn't any more, so they brought out brownies and turtle bars.  I didn't have either, but the brownies were praised, as were the turtle bars.  

So the food seems very hit-or-miss.  If you think it's worth the chance, you might give it a shot...but I would recommend looking for some better options.  (Note:  As a group, we had buffet-style food, so possibly this affected quality, but nonetheless you would think if they want people to come back, they would try harder.  Guess they don't care, and I won't be back.)"}
{"text":"This place is huge, which is good when you have a group of people and are looking for a table.  The portions are huge and the sauces are tasty.  I wish they had a little bit more char or texture, but why nit pick."}
{"text":"The previous reviews kind of scared us but we really enjoyed this restaurant.

The food was great - my husband and I shared two dinners - rack of ribs and the sausage combo platter.  Sides were fries, mac and cheese (recommended by server), cinnamon apples, and cheesy grits.  Mac and cheese needed seasoning,but after I tried the ribs and sausage I didn't mind - they were so delicious and full of flavor that the mac anc cheese was kind of the calm in the storm.

I had a Louisville Swigger (peach puree with house made bourbon) and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  My husband had a couple of the 40+ beers on tap.  No complaints in the drink department!

Our service was a little hit or miss (slow drinks, could be bar's fault) ... we didn't get side plates for our appetizer or a plate/bucket/bowl for our ribs, but we made do.  There are bigger problems in life.

Ask for a window seat if you go.  We had so much fun people watching in this eclectic college town.  The best part of the night was watching college students paying certain individuals to buy them booze at the liquor shop next door to the restaurant and then picking up their booze in the alley next to the restaurant.  We were very entertained!

Overall this is a nice restaurant - great food at a really decent price."}
{"text":"After a recent meal at the haze i was very happy to have a much better meal at brickhouse. The decor is very upscale for a barbecue restaurant, which was surprising, but the meal more than lived up to expectations. I had the pulled pork and ribs which were both quite good. The three sauces were interesting; sweet and tangy was really more a sweet apple flavor, but the vineagar based was excellent on the pork and mustard was slightly spicy with an interesting tang. The ribs didn't need sauce at all, and my sides of mac & cheese and black eye pea fricassee were both quite good. Overall, would definitely try again."}
{"text":"Tried Brickhouse BBQ when my brother was visiting from out of state and we noticed the deal they had on Groupon. When we entered the building and saw the signs advertising the daily specials, my brother and husband were elated to learn we were dining here on $2.50 Pabst pitchers & $1 sliders night. More a Mountain Dew fan than a beer drinker, I was happy to see they serve Pepsi products. The sliders were great, and definitely worth the $1 price. They offer many menu options I haven't seen on other BBQ restaurant menus, such as numerous mac & cheese dishes. I ordered the chipotle mac, which I enjoyed (especially the generous amount of chicken included), but because the amount of chipotle sauce was much more than I was expecting, I think next time I would opt for the basic mac & cheese. My husband ordered ribs, which he really enjoyed, and my brother was impressed with the brisket dish he ordered. Great food all around! Our waitress was friendly, but could have been more attentive, as she seemed to disappear often and we had to wait quite a while to get menus, refills, and our bill. Loved the feel of this place, especially with the exposed brick interior walls and open, roomy feeling layout. Was a fun, warm atmosphere we really liked. The only negative I have about this place, as some other reviews mentioned, is I wish the bbq sauce was labeled, but our waitress was knowledgeable of the flavors of each-no big deal. Really enjoyed our experience here and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was mediocre at best. When I want barbecue, I want something that is super saucy and delicious with a kick to it. I ordered the Hawaiian Pork only to find that it was way too sweet for my taste. The sauce was barely there and Brickhouse doesn't seem to offer anything spicy to tone down the sugar. If I wanted that much sugar, I would have ordered ice cream! I realize it was supposed to be a little sweet, but good grief! My boyfriend ordered the chimichurri steak. He was surprised to see how small of a serving it was for the high cost of the dish. Plus, the meat was tough and hard to chew. It had good flavor, but was not worth the price. The green beans lacked any spice, whatsoever. We'd be up for trying some of the mac n' cheese next time to try other items on the menu. The servers were nice and they have other interesting items on the menu that we'd be willing to check out next time."}
{"text":"I might be a harsh critic because I'm from Texas.. The new was okay. I ordered brisket there, but it wasn't really brisket... It was chopped brisket..the taaste was okay, but one of the most important things in bbq is  the sauce.. And their sauce was very mediocre. If you're in Madison and craving bbq I would be okay with eating here, but it definitely does not compared to Texas bbq"}
{"text":"Had dinner there a few weeks after it opened and wasn't pleased. I had the BBQ pulled pork, that literally had no BBQ on it and was drier than the desert. My boyfriend and our guest got the full rack of ribs. Nether were pleased or happy with their choice. The bartender didn't know the beers they had on tap and seemed pretty out of it.  They did let us sit on the rooftop and brought our food up for us, as it was later there was no server waiting upstairs. It has a nice view from the rooftop, but thats honestly the only good thing I have to say."}
{"text":"We are always in search of good quality \"fall-off-the-bone\" ribs. When searching yelp to help us locate a new place to try we found Brickhouse Barbeque. The pictures looked interesting and we decided to give it a shot. We were very pleased and have now been back several times. The ribs were tender, sauce was flavorful, the sides (garlic mashed potatoes) were very good, portion sizes were generous and the service was helpful and courteous. The decor is minimal, but appropriate for a near campus restaurant. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I remember when this place opened, and how they have some nice patio seating. We decided to sit inside this time, right next to the bar.
Everyone liked the Southern Mac n'Cheese. I was not impressed, plus it was cold. My friend whose lived in NOLA for 2 years, said her grits were mostly liquid, not grits. The cornbread, was bland and cold. The roasted chicken was pretty good.
Only one veggie option for my veggie friend.
The drinks were good, and cheap. But overall I was unimpressed with the quality of food. 
Not enough Comfort in this pseudo Southern establishment."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Brickhouse? I come here so often, it's kind of ridiculous! Mostly because it's close to my house, but also because it's so delicious.

I've had a variety of items here: burgers, quesadillas, mac and cheese, cornbread (and cornbread alone), and lots and lots of beer. I've been here for: date night, meetings, pre-interview mixers, drinks, etc. And every time I've had a great experience. 

This place is underrated for casual drinks. Boyfriend and I come here often on the weekdays to grab a beer or two and maybe even an app to share. Beware--kitchen closes at 10, so make sure you get here before then.

The vibe at Brickhouse is awesome. Three floors and an outdoor patio. OBSESSED with the patio! It's the perfect place to sit out in the summertime, both during the day and at night. They have wood chairs and tables with umbrellas and string lights surrounding the patio. It's intimate and fun to come here at night. 

I've also come here in a big group once or twice (once during a basketball game!) and the waitresses have been very accommodating to us. Sure, service was a little slow during that basketball game, but it wasn't anything worth noting. 

Regarding food: Always hot and fresh. GET THE CORNBREAD. It is SO good (and I'm usually a cornbread hater). I also love any of their mac and cheeses, they are seriously divine. The best mac and cheese in Madison.

Regarding beer selection: vast! Their taps rotate regularly, so I am always very satisfied with their selection. Boyfriend liked their Old Fashioned, but said it was not the best he has had. They did muddle it correctly, so he was happy.

Great place for beers and dinner with friends. Try it!"}
{"text":"We were here when they first opened and again recently.  Meh, is all I can say.  They seem to have a problem serving items at a good temperature for the food.  The beer was barely cold, and the food was barely warm.    The mac n cheese was good, but would have been better served hot.  The Turkey BLT was actually good, but the brisket was just okay and again, barely warm.  I ordered an unsweetened iced tea, which I do often at restaurants.  It really tasted bad.  I mentioned it to our server and she said she would tell the bartender about it.  Unfortunately, she did not remove it from the bill.   We didn't make a stink about the $2.50, but if something as cheap as iced tea is returned, it should be removed from the bill.   She was not a bad server, but I didn't get the feeling from anyone in there that they wanted to \"serve\" people.  They were just there to do their job.  I do not recommend this place.   You can get better food and service elsewhere."}
{"text":"The good:
 *The interior is awesome - they must have spent a ton of $$$ to make that three story beauty possible,
 *Outdoor patio
 *The on tap beer selection is legit - I think its around 50 different beers.
 *Prices are fair (especially on beer!)
 *Cornbread is very good

The un-good: 
 *The food is just decent - it doesn't pop. I wouldn't avoid, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. I think I tried a bunch of different meats too, but was underwhelmed.
 *The service isn't great"}
{"text":"This is fucking stupid. Their speakers don't work. Like I'm sorry don't have a fucking Social if your speakers don't work. Also, when I asked they were rude about the speakers which is unnecessary considering I'm already paying these ridiculous prices!! Sad!!"}
{"text":"I first ate at Brickhouse at least a year ago or more when there was a Groupon special.  At the time, I didn't think it was much to write home about - another bbq place in Madison, whoo.  My reaction changed going there a second time this past weekend.  It was packed on a Friday night, and the food was pretty spectacular. 

I ordered the two meat combo. The ribs are delicious, the brisket was only so-so. The sides were delicious - the spicy green beans, the corn bread, and the yukon potato salad was really, really good.  

My husband ordered the bbq spaghetti, which by the way was huge, and i really enjoyed his dish as well.  it had a spicy and tart kick to it, with fresh tomatoes, and a hint of bbq and lots of meat sprinkled over it (see my photos). 

We will be coming back to try the other main and side dishes.  The cheese curds were also really tasty.  

There are three types of sauces on each table, two of which are bbq and the third which seemed like a really sweet and vinegary mustard."}
{"text":"Have I had better bbq. Yes. Brisket improves much with the sauce selection. But everyone who works here is super nice and helpful. I am currently staring at a wall of 40 drafts all styles of which less than a handful are \"volume\" non craft beers. I myself see at least 10 that are very very good. This place is Comfortable and well stocked."}
{"text":"The food? Not so good. I've been there 4 or 5 times for dinner, and every time the barbecue has been underwhelming, at best. On the flip-side, they've got pretty good side dishes--the spicy green beans are always winners.

A little hint for Brickhouse: You need to mix the sauce in with your meat. The pulled pork is awfully dry without it--let it stew in that stuff...or at least its own juices! Sheesh.

Now, the great: Awesome beer selection. Whoever's choosing taps really knows their stuff--5 stars on tap quality, but food ain't so good, so we round 'em out at 3."}
{"text":"Three starts gets it exactly right. The interior is nice and well constructed, the waitstaff is nice. Worth a stop-by for some OK bbq and a drink.

Burger = good but not great

Catfish platter = good

Brisket = OK

Sides: 

Mac and cheese = bad

Fries = good

Green beans = good

Beans = OK

Potato salad = bad

Cornbread = OK but dry

Sauces = OK

Beer selection = good"}
{"text":"One of our favorite bbq places and in Madison. Seems to always be pretty quiet in there. Foods delicious, really good mac and cheese, pulled pork, blackened catfish and house bbq sauce. Price is good, we have eaten there maybe 10 times now in the last few years and only complaint is we wish the food was warmer. Corn bread is tasty! Not much for parking, gorgeous roof top patio for summer."}
{"text":"Uuummm...it wasn't bad. 

I ordered the Brickhouse Brisket, which I thought would be extremely tender. Not so much. It was actually a little tough, especially the ends. The flavor was good and the meat was cooked to medium rare as I'd requested, but I wouldn't order it again. The cornbread and mashed potatoes I ordered on the side were actually much better than the entree. Hmph. 

My fiance had the ribs, which he enjoyed, but wasn't up to par with his favorites based on how it fell off the bone. Or how it didn't. He enjoyed using the mango habanero sauce on the meat though. Fries were good, beans were okay. 

Overall, not a place we would jump at the chance to come back to. At least the service was great!"}
{"text":"Brickhouse BBQ is a gorgeous restaurant.  We were seated almost immediately and brought waters.  We had to wait a little while until our order was taken.  I got the ribs, mashed potatoes, and creamy coleslaw.  I get this same combination at every BBQ joint I go to.  The ribs were not tender.  They were gritty (I'm assuming because of the rub the cooks used).  The coleslaw was not creamy at all.  However, the mashed potatoes were excellent.  They had large portions of everything, which would have been nice if I had enjoyed their food.  My boyfriend at the brisket sandwich and he didn't even eat half the sandwich.  It was extremely dry.  The service was kind of bad as well.  Our waters didn't get refilled once before we left (and they were both completely empty)."}
{"text":"We didn't originally plan on eating here, but after the two places we originally planned on eating at in the Madison area were closed, We took a look on Yelp and this placed looked pretty promising. After driving around the area attempting to find parking, i FINALLY found parking a block or two west of the restaurant for like $1.50 which isn't bad.  Once we got to the restaurant it was pretty quiet the hostess asked if we wanted to sit on the 3rd floor patio, So we said sure since it was beautiful outside.  The 3rd floor patio is really THEE place to sit if you have the option to do so. 

The Server was a little off, not sure if she had a long day, or what but she could have been a bit nicer but everyone has their day. The menu is pretty good sized,  We decided to have the cheese curds to start the meal and the \"bbq ranch\" dip they have is GREAT. I use the words \"bbq ranch\" loosely as thats what they call it, but i don't know if i could find either flavor either way it is awesome. The Curds themselves were quite good as well. I decided to order the Pulled Pork with a side of the spicy green beans and Mac & Cheese, My fiance ordered the Brickhouse BBQ Mac & Cheese. a few minutes later our food came out, and i couldn't believe the portion my fiance got, 2 bones of Ribs, some Brisket, and some pulled pork AND the mac & Cheese also a piece of cornbread. She enjoyed everything except the cornbread as she is a fan of your traditional sweet  cornbread and their's is a little more on the savory side with a hint of peppers, Not bad just not my preference for cornbread either. My Pulled pork was very good, as was their house BBQ Sauce that i used. the real surprise for me was the spicy green beans, i really enjoyed them! the mac & cheese was good too.  

Overall a good experience, wouldn't mind coming back if or when i am in the area."}
{"text":"Late night dinner on the roof!!...until it started raining. The food was delicious. I highly recommend the Mac n cheese! The staff was very friendly. Only 4 stars because we waited a copious amount of time for our check."}
{"text":"Updating and downgrading on stars. Years later and while they've improved by keeping sauces on the table, it seems even for this college town they just have a revolving door of below average staff. We went for my fiances birthday recently and won't be back - they messed up pretty much every aspect of his order (wrong salad dressing, forgot part of his entree, etc) and while we got some apologies we got some awkward and overdone excuses, too."}
{"text":"Visited with my wife Sunday evening. It's a shame the best part of the meal was the garlic mashed potatoes. The \"brisket\"looked and tasted more like pot roast. The pulled pork reminded me of coffee-crock pot pork. 
Also, I found it interesting the brisket was listed as being available gluten free (just remove the bread). Unfortunately, the cook is unaware that New Glarus Moon Man beer contains gluten.you can't braise a meat in a gluten based beer, then call it gluten free. This ignorance makes people sick."}
{"text":"I'll start this review out with a disclaimer: I'm just another Northerner, and I probably don't know much about BBQ.

My professional organization had an event hosted/catered here on the third floor.  But however they had it arranged for our number of people didn't work, so they put about 4 to 5 of us on the second floor away from the rest of our group, and they wouldn't bring any more chairs out or just one more table for the third floor.  

Next, they had three different types of BBQ available and then mac&cheese and cheese curds in the warmers.  The types of BBQ weren't labeled.  The mac&cheese wasn't very good, and needed more cheese.   It was too dry.  I didn't like any of the BBQ either.  It was not very flavorful, and the sauces weren't impressive.  I've cooked better in my slow cooker.  The cheese curds were probably the tastiest part of the meal, although the warmer didn't keep the temperature consistently warm across all curds.

The bartender was friendly and they had a fair amount of beer on tap, including some dark beers.  Might return, but for beer only.  Would not host another event here."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like Brickhouse BBQ due to its downtown location, nice and spacious interior, and fantastic-looking rooftop patio. 

When I visited, I ordered fried cheese curds--a Wisconsin specialty if there ever was one--and found them to be bland and extremely greasy, even for a cheesy item that is breaded and then dropped in a fryer. For the main course, I ordered a brisket sandwich, which was all-around disappointing. The meat, though relatively tender, had NO smoked or meaty flavor. On top of that, they added cheese and onion strings, both of which were also dripping with grease. Of course I understand that no BBQ place is a particularly healthy establishment, but this one just had puddles of grease on everything we tried (my husband had similar results with the pulled pork sandwich). Overall, this was just the kind of meal that not only made me feel gross after eating it, but that made me pretty sure a heart condition was on its way as well. 

Nonetheless, I can't promise I wouldn't return for one of Madison's only rooftop venues. Maybe to try some drinks?"}
{"text":"Yum, is it ok to say yum five more time? Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!!!!

Yeah, it was delicious.  I ordered the pulled pork dinner.  It came with a piece of Texas toast.  There was so much pork on my plate that it engulfed my toast.  I ordered the Roasted Veggies and Mac n Cheese as my sides.  I had two full meals from the leftovers I took home.  The portions are ridiculous.  

As for the taste?  Sensational.  The Mac n Cheese must have a cream cheese component.  It was so creamy and delicious.  The pulled pork was flavorful without being too salty or greasy.  

Why only four stars?  The space and the way the restaurant is laid out feels so cold.  I just can not get comfortable.  It felt very cold and isolated.  I was hoping to have a more homey feel.  Not to mention, I wish they would update their website.  

I love Brickhouse BBQ.  I find any excuse to go back."}
{"text":"Let me start with the pros: the beer selection was great and the ribs and onion ring appetizer was a perfect pre-dinner split. I'm not big on ribs and I really enjoyed how these fell off the bone. I also think the wait staff was great when it came to requests. My wife asked for horseradish sauce without knowing if they had any and we ended up getting some to dip our cheese curds in.

Now the cons: it took a while to get my drinks... Like a long while after my first one. There was also a lot of confusion and disappointment from patrons when they did not honor the pre-great taste specials that were posted online. 

I would probably go back and sit somewhere other than the bar to get some better attention and faster drinks."}
{"text":"Great food. Good ribs (nice bark!) Pulled Pork is always a safe bet. We'll be back. Beer and Bourbon lists are very complete. Gotsta Go!"}
{"text":"They have a great selection of beer, and they should as they are apparently owned by their next door neighbor, Riley's.  Their beer is very reasonably priced and the server informed us that they're rotated out every so often.  It's a nice atmosphere inside: not too fancy, but not your local dive either where you're afraid to touch the tables in case they stick.  It seemed like a great place to chill and relax at.  I have no idea how they handle a big group, but I might like this for a place for hanging out with friends better than the Dane.  

The food was not very good.  I had the catfish sandwich, and it was a bit soggy.  I think there was just a bit too much sauce or oil or whatever."}
{"text":"WORST PULLED PORK, EVER!!  Didn't touch it...complained to manager...still for charged.

Decent collards, however."}
{"text":"The BBQ is good. I like their pulled pork dinner served on top of texas toast. The toast gets nice and soggy underneath the meat. They serve the food with a selection of BBQ sauces.

I never really realized they had so many taps. I'll have to go back to try. The last time I was here it was a couple of days before my 21st birthday. Taps do make a difference in my ratings..."}
{"text":"I visited on a Saturday evening after a long walk last weekend.  

I thought the food and atmosphere were great.  The bartender on the 2nd floor was also outstanding with great food and beer recommendations.

I had a 1/3 rack of ribs....very good.  Not fall of the bone type of ribs, but very tasty.

The sides were simply amazing.  I got the mac and cheese and the green beans.  Best mac and cheese I have had in a long time....not too soppy or wet, but great flavor.  And the green beans were cooked perfectly and had fabulous flavor as well.

I would highly recommend and I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for this place $15 for $30, best Groupon I have ever purchased. I had the Ribs along with the southern mac n cheese and coleslaw. All I can say was wow. Best Mac n cheese I have ever had!!!!! I eat at alot of BBQ joints and I can tell you that these ribs were terrific. 
The portion size was amazing. I had food for the next day's lunch! not to mention all the beers they had on tap. Great place to eat.
My wife had the pulled pork sandwich along with Veggies, she loved it as well.
Best BBQ ribs in Madison. I'll be heading back with or without a Groupon. 
Great first experience Brickhouse!"}
{"text":"A 4.5 might be more appropriate, and that's only beause I like to save my 5 star rating for someplace really special... 

As people have said before, the beer selection is top-notch in the city, and they post the alcohol content so you know what you're getting into. The food is fancy-bar food, but A. what do you expect at a Barbeque, and B. that probably has something to do with my preferences. I ordered the pulled pork, and it was everything I want in a pulled pork. 

Atmosphere is quite nice. Madison doesn't have a ton of mid-level sit down places that aren't chain-restaurants, aren't dirty, and are affordable. It really fills a niche I didn't realize Madison was missing, so Kudos to you Mrs. Lee. 

For those of you unaware, Mrs. Lee is the Trump of Madison. She owns Church Key, Vinyard (liquor store below Key), Riley's, Samba, and now the Brickhouse. 

Anyhow, this place is worth a visit and if I still lived in Madison I would probably eventually have my own menu item. Far better than the bum shelter that previously occupied the building. Who would want to eat at a bum shelter?"}
{"text":"New favorite place in Madison! The must-try Sunday $5 \"Bloody Mary & Cow\" was perfect for a Sunday Afternoon.... A delicious & unique spin on a classic! The Hawaiian Pork was seriously amazing, as was the mashed sweet potato casserole (just make sure they still have some!) The bartenders are super friendly & take good care of their customers. I highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Brickhouse has the worst service I've ever experienced by far. I've gone a couple times and the place has always been nearly empty. Even with only a few customers, the wait staff does not keep up. I'm not sure what they are doing, but we ordered beers and every time the waiter came back with the wrong one. There were only three choices for kill the keg on Thursdays. The $8 for unlimited beer was sadly wasted because the waiter only came by a couple time and for each order he returned 20 minutes later with the wrong order. I ended up drinking one beer because by the time he would come back I would most likely not get a beer for the next 20 min and I just do not have the time for that. 

On top of that the food was underwhelming. I do love the Cobb salad there, but the presentation was horrible. It comes with pulled pork, but I just got a slab of pork weighing down my salad unpulled. When we got our food we weren't given silverware. So we had to wait another 10 min for the server to come back with the rest of our food and ask for silverware.

Basically horrible service and underwhelming food."}
{"text":"Not too impressed. When I called to ask for the nearest parking garage the hostess didn't know and directed me to one almost a mile away when there was one around the corner. Second, the waitress did not know how much a salad was with my entree. She guessed. I ended up ordering the salad and I got my meal before my salad. When I asked to have it before she replied \"we are really busy and couldn't get the salads before the meal\". Ugh! The food was just OK. Setting and cleanliness was good but overall not impressed!"}
{"text":"Menu selection was very good and service was great on a quiet downtown Saturday. I had a combo of ribs & brisket while hubby went with all brisket. Both of us found the meats to be tough and quite fatty which is not our preference. Sides were generally fine and presentation was good. Might be good if drinking heavily on a football Saturday but not if you're on the hunt for really good BBQ."}
{"text":"You would think due to the location and size of Brickhouse that it would be better but unfortunately in my two experiences there, I have not been impressed. 

Both times I have come to Brickhouse was for holiday work parties. We have rented out the 3rd floor space which is pretty cool. It has its own bar and a huge selection of beer which is the main reason for the 2 star rating. 

The biggest reason I rate them so low is due to the food. I have been to many BBQ spots around the midwest and Brickhouse lacks significantly. Granted both times it has been buffet style, but the food is bland and barely warm or even cold."}
{"text":"I think this is a fun restaurant! They've got a fabulous tap beer selection. I have dinned here a total of two times for dinner. 
I've liked the good each time. The first time I had their pulled pork on Texas toast with two sides. I choose Mac n cheese and cornbread, which was all good. Mathis most recent time I was here with a bachelorette party and I shared the pulled pork nachos that were made mainly with queso cheese and very tasty but some bites had more of a spice to them than others. They put a huge amount if sour cream right on top which I love with my nachos. I also had a cup of their chicken chili. I found it to be delicious! I only wish it was hotter when I was finally brought to our table.
Service as a whole I would rate 2/5 stars. It was extremely slow."}
{"text":"Yummy, but not what I think of when I think of a \"BBQ\" place. Definitely more upscale than your average barbecue joint. I actually felt a little weird picking up my ribs with my hands to eat them(When we are jonesin' for some Q, we usually go to Smoky Jon's, which is your \"paper towels on the table, get down and messy\" kind of place).

Anyhow, everything was decent. They have a two meat combo, which is nice when you want a little of this, and a little of that. I got the ribs and sausage. Ribs were really yummy, and the sausage while good, was unexpected--with a mustard sauce and lightly pickled peppers on top. Not your average style barbecue. The man had a pulled pork sandwich, juicy...but too smoked for my taste.

They serve all three of their sauces with the meal. Our fave was the molasses based sauce, hands down. The vinegar was okay, and the mustard \"barbecue sauce\" just seemed like tasty mustard. Eh. 

I chose the cheese grits, which were good...but fluffier in texture than I'm used to. The server recommended the roasted veggie pasta salad, which was average(not that it mattered, I was too full to eat it anyhow). 

Really torn between three and four stars. We'd like to check it out upstairs, so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Pulled pork was bad.  Very fatty and the meat didn't looked like pulled pork.  Not impressed with the wait staff.  We heard two other tables complain about the pulled pork being fatty and gross. It didn't seem like there was a manager around to address these issues.  Will never go back.

If you want to eat real BBQ food go to Smoky Jon's on the east side of Madison."}
{"text":"I tried the lunch special for Restaurant Week.  The meal consisted of nachos topped with beef brisket - which were average; a pulled pork sandwich - which was bland and unseasoned; and a strawberry shortcake - which was tasty although tiny.  Three different barbecue sauces came with the meat, but they were also so weak as to be indistinguishable - even the \"spicy\" mustard sauce.   

The service, however, was top notch, although business was slow.

There are many better BBQ places in town.  I'll stick with those."}
{"text":"Awful. Cold Mac n Cheese, undercooked green beans, over blackened catfish and brisket I had to put so much sauce on to make it taste good. In addition, the bartender didn't know how to make an old fashioned. C'mon..."}
{"text":"Recently went here. They had deals on groupon and I've been here a couple times. Even though the reviews are a mixed bag, I really thought my experience was great. The environment was very nice. You have the option to sit inside, upper deck, or back patio. I ordered the two meat combo and chose 1/3 ribs, brisket, Mac , and sweet potato fries. Didn't really like the fries, but everything else was wonderful. They have specials every day and this info is posted on the front. It's a great place to eat during the summer time.other times can be very busy."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a barbeque restaurant that I have been blown away by, and my search continues. I ordered the Dragon's Milk beer with the pulled pork with double side of sweet potato fries. My favorite part of my meal was probably stealing my boyfriend's side of spicy beans. The barbeque sauces provided were alright but forgettable, and the pork was moist. But as I said, the whole meal didn't impress me; it tasted like a meal I could buy at any restaurant that serves anything barbeque.

The part of the meal that upset me the most was the sweet potato fries; sweet potatoes (more-so sweet potato fries) are one of my favorite foods in the world. I will always get it no matter where I am. However, the sweet potato fries here were slightly cold, stale, and mushy (and I never believed that combination could exist). 

Menu had a variety of items, and the beer menu was eclectic. The environment was friendly, open, and large, and the server was nice and attentive.

Overall, the barbeque was delicious but forgettable. I would be willing to go again, but only after I forget the abominable sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"I went last night with a friend--and it was just a bad idea.

The ribs, which are normally pretty solid were burnt to a crisp, bland, and dry. I'm not a fan of well done meat, especially for barbeque because you can get the nice coat without destroying the inside meat.

Additionally, our waitress was, like many other posters mentioned, wasn't very attentive. It took her 20 minutes to figure out that we needed our bill, and it's not like the place was super busy. When we came in originally too, the hostess was busy talking to a friend until a waitress pointed out we were waiting.

It seems every time I come here, this place just gets more bland and less tasty to me. I think I'm going to avoid coming here for awhile."}
{"text":"Very mixed experiences from visit to visit.  The last visit was not good...we used the Groupon and had the following issues.  Server wasn't that engaged, wrong entree was brought out, and the entrees were brought out before we got half way through the appetizer.  On the plus side, beer selection is outstanding, mac and cheese is great, and typically the food is really good."}
{"text":"There really wasn't anything bad about Brickhouse - it was just okay. I wasn't very hungry when I got there, so that may have contributed to my lack of \"wooooo this is great!\" feelings.

I will say, though, the service was quick, attentive, and accurate (we had a group of 8), and the classic burger was pretty good. The fries that came with it were especially tasty - really nicely seasoned with some interesting flavors in there.

Even with the lack of high points, I'll probably try Brickhouse again; this time when I'm hungrier."}
{"text":"I loved this place until I met Gretchen. We came in for my best friend's birthday night and Gretchen was incredibly rude, condescending, and unprofessional. I asked for her last name and she responded \"give me your last name\" as if we were in middle school dissing each other. I've worked in the service industry for over 5 years now and have never seen my fellow coworkers treat any guest this way. I myself have worked in a similar \"college\" environment as Gretchen does and I was able to professionally deal with all guests at all times. We asked to see the manager and she said that she was the manager, which made the situation only more disappointing. I've never seen a manager deal with a situation so unprofessionally. Whenever my family comes to visit Madison from out of state, I always brought them to this establishment. Never again. We were a group of over 6 people, so she explained that we could not split a check all together. We completely understood, so we asked to sit at two separate tables. She said that because we know each other, that's not possible. She then threatened us by saying \"maybe you can go to Hopcat to be served.\" Never in all my years have I been threatened by a manager. Then Gretchen proceeded to say that we were are unhappy, we should leave a Yelp review about. The servers around Gretchen were so uncomfortable with Gretchen's comments and condescending tone that they left the area to seek relief. I used to love this place, but have never felt so disrespected by any manager. We were polite and understanding of her policies, but she refused to return this respect. I'd also like to point out that the restaurant was almost empty on the first floor, so lack of space or it being a busy night was not a factor. I wish I could give less than 1 star."}
{"text":"Wish i could give less than one star. We went in with a large group and were they wouldn't seat us, even if we broke into smaller groups. There were multiple empty tables open that we could see, and the manager very rudely told us we couldn't eat there, period, because we had too many people. What kind of a restaurant turns away customers! Awful. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I am torn on this one. I didn't really care for my meal, but there wasn't really anything bad about it.

I had wanted to order the brisket sandwich, but Brickhouse BBQ opts for slicing over pulling. I'm not a big meat person, but when I do eat it, I don't want to see any pink. Not wanting to have to deal with a pile of possibly not-cooked-enough-for-me brisket, I opted for the chicken sandwich. 

The chicken breast was huge, an inch thick in some places. It was almost too much. Unfortunately, there was a spongy bit (fat? other weird things I don't really want to think about?), so that was kind of gross. There was a lot of char, which I'm not a fan of, but once again - that's a matter of personal preference, not really anything that Brickhouse did wrong. I would, however, recommend that they put the monster of a sandwich on something stronger than white toast - I had to eat my sandwich with a knife and fork because the sauce and other toppings rendered the bread useless. 

Several people at the table chose the pulled pork sandwich and were really happy with it; the people who chose salads seemed ambivalent.  The fries were pretty good, but of the battered variety - I prefer my spuds simple. 

Brickhouse has a large selection of beers & other drinks, but beware of the price. My friend ordered a margarita rocks from the bar while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive and it ended up being $7.50. In Madison, that's pretty pricey, especially for a restaurant bar during what is normally considered happy hour."}
{"text":"Great beer selection- tons of craft stuff on tap. Good is solid, waitstaff is decent. Check it out"}
{"text":"This is the fourth time I've been to this restaurant, and it was great as always.  The beer list is extensive, with 40 beers to choose from, not to mention the great bbq.  The lovely young ladies that were serving the customers were extremely friendly and attentive.  I'll be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Brickhouse has been on my list to try for several months and after finally getting the opportunity it was not hit.  The sides, mac-n-cheese and greens, were better than the meat.  The ham was dry and ribs tasted like they have been warmed over for the past couple of days. Was definitely hoping for better."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my meal. The brisket tastes old and had an off taste to it. The pit beans tasted like just chili with extra beans in it. My buddy had same opinion on meal. I will say had good atmosphere and the service was good but if they continue to serve sub part food won't be there for long. I hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Their tap beer selection was outstanding, unfortunately that's about the only positive thing I can say.  Their BBQ sauce (which most BBQ lovers know can make or break your restaurant) was extremely watered-down, service was average at best and their food was just OK overall.  It seems like they're trying to go gourmet with BBQ, which in my opinion isn't working for them.  Smoky Jon's is still the only place you can get \"real\" BBQ in Madison."}
{"text":"I didn't try the \"authentic\" BBQ stuff like ribs but I did have a chicken sandwich there and I found it it really delicious.  The interior is lovely, the beers are nicely priced, and our waiter was attentive and polite.  And considering the restaurant is supposed to be upscale, the price for the food was not bad."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ but slow service. Maybe becauce it was Monday night? I don't know... I have to mention wide selection of beer and free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Heaping brisket sandwich with full on beefy flavor and not fatty. The only gripe I had was that the bread was a little much and one almost needs an unhindgable jaw to get a propper bite. Good mac and cheese and it was a rather large \"side.\" The mustard based sauce is something you don't find very much around these parts and I loved it. The habanero peach BBQ sauce was sweet and had a little kick and went very well with the pulled BBQ. Good experience and I will continue to keep coming back."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of looking over the reviews before starting to write my own.  A lot of negative reviews...making me wonder if my awesome meal a little while ago was real or just a dream...

Well if it was a dream I am going to go back for another dream as soon as I can!  I didn't want a heavy beefy meal so I went with the grilled chicken sandwich with bacon, cheddar, tomatoes, carmalized onions, spicy mayo, and bbq sauce.  Yes it was quite wet but it was delicious.  The bacon was not your run-of--the-mill oscar mayer.  It was thick and tasty yet cooked to crispy perfection.  The fries were great.  The three dipping sauces were all good with a special mention of the mustard based bbq sauce.  Who would have thought that would have been so tasty!

She had the appetizer portion of the ribs and we both agreed that they were the tastiest ribs either of us has ever had.  My grandfather used to smoke ribs for hours and Brickhouse's were right up there with his.

Beer selection was impressive.  Our server was fast and friendly.  The restaurant itself is modern yet warm...basically a beautiful setting for a wonderful meal.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is really good. The ribs, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes are all excellent. I wasn't expecting great cheese curds from a BBQ joint but they were delicious (not overly battered, well flavored). Service has always been good and the waitstaff is really nice."}
{"text":"I'm not sure you can consider this actual BBQ. It is more like cooked meat with BBQ sauce on it. The brisket was terrible. No crust on it whatsoever, not tender, and absolutely no flavor. The BBQ sauce didn't even help it out because it also tasted like it came from a generic bucket marked \"BBQ sauce\". I gave most of it to my dog who left some over as well. The pulled pork was edible but also tastes like the pulled pork you get from Costco, if not worse, and definitely overpriced. The cornbread also tasted like it came from a prepackaged can. Tasteless and kinda dry. Absolutely a disappointing attempt at BBQ. For BBQ lovers who know what is what, save your money and avoid this place."}
{"text":"BBQ is the focus of a BBQ joint. At $20/plate, I hoped to see some meat. Servings are true serving sizes. Had the two meat platter, was truly 4 ounces total. Brisket was dry and chewy. Pulled pork was dry. Brisket comes out thinly sliced and all meat is on top of the Texas toast leaving it soggy. I concur with other reviews that refer to BBQ from the south. This is no gem."}
{"text":"Met a couple of people here for drinks and food.  The bbq is okay, but not great.  It is really greasy, and not in a good way. I don't know where all that grease is coming from! But it hits the spot after a few beers.  They do have a GREAT beer selection and a beautiful rooftop to sit on, so I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Brickhouse every Tuesday since they started trivia around a year ago. It was great then. It has steadily grown in popularity since and the management has done nothing to accommodate the large number of people every week. Some weeks there will be one server and one bartender for the entire packed restaurant. They have an entire upstairs that they don't even utilize. 
Despite these issues, the food is fairly good and the bartender and most of the servers are great. The exception is the purple haired server who is consistently very rude and condescending to everyone. She is concerned about the fire code which is fine, but her complete lack of hospitality is the issue here. After several members of my team were yelled at this week we will no longer be returning. 
It's a shame, there are a lot of great things about Brickhouse. I hope they can work on accommodating the trivia goers, and regular patrons on Tuesdays and find more servers who know what customer service is."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place doesn't have very good reviews - I've lived in Texas my whole life and this is not bad BBQ. Much better than That BBQ Joint and Dave's on Park.

The location is super convenient, the service was good, and the ambience is pretty neat. The place is also actually a relatively 'nice' sit down restaurant, unlike people may think based on the exterior. It's pretty huge on the inside! They also have trivia on Tuesdays which is super fun.

Overall, I got their brisket plate and it was delicious! Good portions and good sides. The brisket didn't blow me away but it was by no means bad. Check this place out if you've been looking for above average bbq!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place a couple of times over the years, and have always been disappointed. I thought I'd give it another try, and was again disappointed. The ribs were thin and had little meat. What meat was to be found between the bones was stringy and over cooked. The sides are fine, and they have a large beer selection, but that doesn't compensate for the poor quality meat. There are much better places in Madison for BBQ."}
{"text":"If I were to recommend Brickhouse, I would suggest just going there for beers and appetizers. They have a very good beer selection. They also have a good rooftop patio for a nice day.

In terms of the food, it wasn't great for me. I got the ribs and they were cooked well, but the cut of meat that they gave me was incredibly fatty, which was gross. I also got corn on the cob as a side and they brought me butter, but no salt or pepper, which I found odd. Our friends got their smoked pulled pork and it was again good, but nothing special. We make better smoked pork on our smoker at home, it has much more flavor.

Last, we went with our kids and even though this place is downtown and may not advertise itself as \"kid friendly\", they could've done a better job. They took WAY to long to get us our check when the kids were obviously getting antsy, and it wasn't even that busy. Come to think of it, it took a longer than avg time to get our drinks as well."}
{"text":"We went the other night and while the decor and ambiance is amazing and so beautifully done, I was left wishing the food had been as great. 

I like how they keep unique pint glasses on each table and that the tables are simple and neat.  It wasn't very busy when we went and we were seated right away and given drinks within 5 minutes.  Our server was incredibly nice and did a great job.

I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of the mac and cheese and my bf had the brisket sandwich.  His was awesome, with really great flavors.  Mine was just alright and I've definitely had better at a lower price, the mac and cheese however was really good.  Unfortunately my sandwich had an unwelcome hair in it and without me even saying anything, the waitress noticed my face, took it away, comped it and apologized.  Her handling of the situation was perfect and I do understand that accidents happen everywhere.  It certainly won't hinder me from trying it again.

The service was quick and friendly and it was certainly nice to have a variety of different BBQ sauces to add to the food.  Everyone seemed efficient and friendly, and again I can't say enough how beautifully decorated it was.

I can't wait to see what the huge outdoor patio is like as the weather gets nicer!"}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of BBQ, so let's just get it out of the way now and admit that the likelihood of any restaurant in the Midwest truly competing with the best BBQ has to offer is slim to none.  No offense, and I'm not even from BBQ country.

1)  The BEER selection is insanely awesome.  I would return here solely to drink beer because they have so many great options (many of which are local!)

2)  The food.  Ok, obvious choice here, but let me elaborate.  First, the portions are pretty insane.  I had the Brisket Sandwich, and while I did finish the plate I kind of regretted doing it.  Luckily, I had been starving before I walked in to try this place.  The brisket itself was well done, it was a great chunk of meat size-wise (run with that however you want), and it reminded me of good BBQ.  The sauces are, to me anyway, obviously homemade (and I mean that in a bad way).  The smokey, typical, BBQ sauce is delicious.  Well done there.  The vinegar sauce isn't too bad, but I think that vinegar BBQ fans will be disappointed.  The mustard was Ter-ri-ble.  It tastes like mustard and lacks the nuance and layered flavors that real mustard-based BBQ sauces have.  Kudos for trying though.  I actually found that I liked mixing the vinegar with the smokey-molasses, but they should really only give people the latter.  Thank god they gave me all three choices, which was a nice touch.  If I had been forced to use the mustard, I would have walked out.  The fries were some of the best I remember eating.  Wow.  Keep doing what you're doing there.

As far as the atmosphere, that's a great word to describe a place that seems kind of small until you realize that there are three floors.  Each floor has its bar as well (great planning!).  Nothing else is too special about it other than the fact that there is actually brick in The Brickhouse.  

The service was awesome.  I sat at the bar and Clayton served me.  We talked about football and a few other topics over the course of lunch.  Good conversation, good service, and he even offered to give me a tour of the place when I told him that I had been curious about it for a while before finally showing up to try it out.

Price is good.  When your food arrives, you know that you probably haven't paid enough for the portion you get.  This is likely covered up in the cost of whatever meat they're using.  I don't know where they source it, but BBQ is kind of about making great meat out of anything.   So, while I don't really care, it would be cool if they had a local option with their food like they have with their beer.

I'll be back.

UPDATE: How could I forget to mention that they have somewhere around 40-50 types of Bourbon.  I love Bourbon.  If you love it too, you'll find this place to be very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Went to Brickhouse with two buddies for the first time in about a year, and all three of our meals were horrible.  The ribs and the brisket were way over cooked and tough.  Shocking how bad it was.  The corn bread was totally and entirely dry, just paln bad.  I had eaten here in the past and the sausage was good, so I was very disappointed, but the food cannot lie.  Luckily, the Miller Lite was on special for $2 a pint and the waitress was really friendly and did her best."}
{"text":"We visited Brickhouse twice while in Madison on 7/11/14 and the following night.  The first day was late afternoon before the dinner rush so it was obviously a slow time.  Excellent meals both visits and sampled a variety of items.  Fantastic BBQ and I especially recommend the ribs.  Top notch beer selection also for the craft beer lovers out there.  Tons of food and you won't leave hungry that's for sure.

One note about our second visit on Saturday night about 8:30.  We were in town for a high school world archery tournament and had a party of close to 30.  We originally wanted to hook-up at a different restaurant downtown but our first choice was a smaller place with limited seating, and we were looking at obviously a very long wait.  Because of our great experience the previous day, I placed a call to Brickhouse and explained the situation with our large group.  Expecting perhaps to be laughed at or a sarcastic comment about seating such a large group during a prime time, I was surprised how accommodating the staff was, especially when I explained that in no way were we looking to have everyone sit together.  They could break us up as necessary, whatever worked best for seating on their end.  The person on the phone (can't remember her name) said no problem come on over.

We walked over and they ended up re-arranging tables on the 2nd floor to seat about 20 and the rest were split into two tables.  The point is, many places would make the customer realize what a pain the butt it is to make these type of accommodations, but the staff at Firehouse went above & beyond.  Thanks for making the visit so enjoyable both times, and I'll be sure to stop back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"They didn't have the one beer I was looking for (Pumpking). 
I was told if I write a review solely based on that... I'm \"that yelper.\"
So in addition to them not having the beer that I went there for, they also serve sauce-less wings in this sort of DIY format that is nowhere near getting a thoroughly dredged and sauced up wing that leaves you wishing you had more napkins. I'll try 'em out again and explore more of the menu and hope they have Pumpking next time on draft."}
{"text":"This place is like ---this close--- to being awesome. I can't say anything bad about the food----but it fell short in most other areas. We went there because it was voted \"best rooftop patio\"...but the roof was closed for a private event. Obviously a bummer. They offered us a spot on the back patio, which was a beautiful space----but we were seated under some type of giant ventilation fan that I'm pretty sure was pumping out greasy kitchen air. Pretty unappetizing. Fortunately the entire patio was open (so not sure why we were given that seat) so we moved ourselves to something more scenic. Looking around it was obvious that the patio needed a good 30 minutes of cleaning and tidying up-----many of the tables looked dusty.....cobwebs between the railings. Its unfortunate because like I said...it's a beautiful space. There's also a nice area for playing bags---but their bag set was really sad (some saggy plastic thing sponsored by miller, sigh). It would take very little effort to make the atmosphere back there go from a 3 to a 5. 

The service was also kind of disappointing. Our server failed to bring plates, silverware or napkins with our appetizer until asked, and then delivered our main dish (which were sharing) and didn't return with new plates until we had already split it up on our appetizer plates. 

Overall I'm not in a hurry to go back----but the Brickhouse Mac N Cheese was probably good enough for me to return eventually."}
{"text":"We were staying at Hampton Inn and had Brickhouse deliver, so i can't talk about decor or service. The food was great. We ordered the two meat entree with brisket and smoked turkey. (I do wish the tri tip was an option.) The brisket was tender, but not quite as flavorful as I'd hoped, but the turkey was fantastic! The cornbread and the smashed red potatoes were also uncommonly good. The chicken wings were serviceable, but I was a little disjointed by the duck legs which didn't really taste like anything without the dipping sauce. The portions were a good size and the price was right."}
{"text":"When you order barbeque at this place they give you three different sauces, and tell you about each one. I wouldn't bother listening though, since they are sweet, extra sweet, and grossly sweet.

If you want your food to taste like it was made in a pixi sticks factory go here. Otherwise, I'd advise sticking to the beer. You can also expect terrible service."}
{"text":"Under new management, and a VERY small menu. After walking downtown looking for a place to eat, every place was packed or only accepting reservations due to college graduation. We went on a Friday night and the place had 3 people in it. On a Friday UW GRADUATION night. Menu was disappointing to say the least, especially having been here in the past and loved the food. This place will be lucky to last another 2 months at the rate they are going."}
{"text":"It's...ok at best. 

Maybe I've been ruined by having barbecue in real barbecue cities like Memphis and St. Louis. But just because this is Madison doesn't mean you can't make good barbecue here too. Brickhouse doesn't quite get there for me. 

Think of it as a place with good beer selection and halfway decent BBQ, and you're less likely to be disappointed. But this is far from a transcendental BBQ experience."}
{"text":"Tried this place during restaurant week 2012. I'm a huge fan of BBQ and Brickhouse had never come across my radar before so I was eager to check it out. They served the chicken skewer app with three different BBQ sauces (yay!) follwed by a rack of ribs with a side of mac & cheese. The mac was delicious, creamy, with bread crumb topping. There was peach cobbler for dessert but I only got one bite down because I was so full (having a stout beer helped with that). Finding parking and walking there is a hassle if you don't live downtown, I will try it again if I'm in the mood for navigating there."}
{"text":"I had come to Brickhouse BBQ on a couple of occasions thanks to Groupon and I found that given their prices they were mediocre.

On one occasion I had BBQ brisket and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese there is very good (but that's hard to mess up) but the brisket was drier than I expected it to be. On a later visit I decided I'd go with the chicken and unfortunately encountered the same thing-- the chicken was dry. 

The sauce selections were alright, but nothing that really made me want to use only that particular sauce.

After a couple of attempts my wife and I decided not to come back at least until there is evidence of a change in direction for the food quality."}
{"text":"Great service and very good food.  The meat was very tender and the smash garlic potatoes were awesome!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Brickhouse when we were visiting family in Madison. Our party of 8 was seated at a large table on the second floor. Nice ambiance, very spacious, not too noisy. 

Our table ordered a variety of dishes: hush puppies, vegetable sandwich, sausage sandwich, Brickhouse ribs, two meat combos. Everything was huge! I was thrilled with my vegetable sandwich. Gigantic portabella mushrooms! Generous side of fries. $7.99. This was 2 meals for me. 

Only 1 person at our table wasn't happy with their meal because the ribs and roasted chicken were too dry. Way too dry. Like it's been sitting there under a heat lamp for hours and hours. 

P.S. The 3 different BBQ sauces are delicious!"}
{"text":"Not sure why every time we visit this place it's dead. We always eat at the bar and have great service from the bartender. $5 bloody Mary's on Sunday's with the choice of any chaser. Good good at reasonable price."}
{"text":"Was not happy with there Thursday evening kill the keg. The staff was seemed like they wanted us to leave so they could close but this was still very early in the evening. Also the one beer option in the keg was flat."}
{"text":"Was there this past weekend and had a GREAT time!!  Staff was fantastic, food was good, and the brews were very,very good. Our son is a student at the UW and I plan to spend time at this place whenever we visit. Loved our time there."}
{"text":"The waiter was very unpleasant. He took his time taking our order. We finally got our food close to an hour later. Everything was cold and unappetizing. We went on a Sunday afternoon. They only had a handful of customers. There's no excuse for the rude service and long wait. Save your money and time. I recommend trying anywhere else!"}
{"text":"A visit in 2016 proved that Brickhouse BBQ has some failings, although they do maintain a good beer program.  Upon entering the 2 story building (and a rooftop patio), I noticed that our booth had a large rip in the seat.  In addition, the booth's seat back was directly connected to the other person's bench behind you, so you both parties could feel the seat backs moving around. Distracting.

The servers were pleasant and efficient.  Each entree comes with 2 sides and a cornbread, which is more than generous, and the sides don't include an upcharge for stuff like mac and cheese or sweet potato fries instead of potato fries.  I ordered the beef brisket, mac and cheese, and fries.  Our food came out quickly, but it was disappointing. The brisket had no smoke ring and the fries were clearly not fresh--they were warm instead of piping hot. The mac&cheese was fine, although it had a bit more of a butter taste than super cheesy. The cornbread is of a sweeter northern style.  The Hawaiian pork is really overly sweet.  At the table, you have 3 BBQ sauces, a regular (relatively sweet), a mango something, and a sriracha something. Out of these, the sriracha is the best.

Onto the positive--service was good, and the beer list and patio.  I did not visit the patio, but the view was very nice when I went a few years ago. In addition to a large beer list, they had quite a few good beers on special for $3 a pint.

I won't be returning for food. I can see it being an option for beer, especially on the patio."}
{"text":"Visit Madison often to visit our daughter who is a student at the UW.  Great town for foodies due to the high quality of the restaurants and various ethnic food options.   Last week we stopped by the Brickhouse for the first time.  Had a barbecue pork sandwich, which was amazing, while my wife had the Korean BBQ meal.   Out waitress was friendly and attentive,  and the manager was engaged with his customers.  Overall it was an excellent experience.   Planning to return often."}
{"text":"good food but not your idea of a typical smokehouse. Not in St.Louis so i can't say i was disappointed at the quality of their BBQ either, but not the best i've ever had. Nice place to sit and enjoy a quiet conversation in beautiful space looking out onto the busy street if you're not looking for a knock your socks off BBQ experience."}
{"text":"The worst part about this place is knowing that you're too old to not need a nap before you try to go out afterward.  Great portions for the money.  I'm a big fan of meat, and this place does it right.  The chicken isn't dry, and the ribs are tender without being messy.  You also get a choice of two sides with a dinner, which really means you only need to decide on one because, good God, if you don't already have the mac 'n cheese penciled in...good luck in life.

Very accomodating for large groups.  A positively astounding beer selection."}
{"text":"They've got Toppling Goliath on top, if you've got a craving for a solid IPA."}
{"text":"Aye, Brickhouse has really let me down a few times, which is unfortunate because they host some fun events/specials and I love their space. 

Our most recent visit was spoiled with mediocre food and bad drinks. 

We opted to sit on the rooftop (it's really beautiful up there, but it always seems to be empty/not utilized). There was a bartender up there who took our drink order, but she let us know that their tap system upstairs doesn't work very well because it's on the third floor. After ordering one beer, my boyfriend commented that it was quite flat, and she shrugged it off and said many of the taps are flat up there. After selecting one of the few she recommended as being a safe bet, we ordered food and sat down. 

I got the black bean burger, which came out charred and crispy. For my side, I chose coleslaw, which was actually decent. My boyfriend got the shrimp and polenta, which was listed under the entrees section, but does not come with a side (the waitress said it was a misprint?). 

I've been here multiple times and it always seems to be wacky. They just can't seem to serve good food and pair it with good service. Their space is massive and maintained well, so it's a shame they can't capitalize on it."}
{"text":"Rating is for the beer selection...top notch.  Cool building, nice location.  Will be back for the Q..."}
{"text":"My first experience at Brickhouse BBQ was to attend a birthday party hosted in the third floor room. I was really impressed with the space and made a mental note to remember it for future events due to its lovely aesthetics and spacious room. The food served was great and memorable. After this when I saw a groupon available I knew I had to buy it. We came early on Monday night and it felt a little awkward being the only people in such a large space, but within 15 minutes the place started filling up. Prior to ordering I alerted our server (though I think he was actually the bartender or manager) that we would be using the groupon. 

During our meal I overheard another server inform his table that there were menu restrictions with the groupon, knowing we ordered two basic/ not the most expensive entrees I thought we were fine, but was surprised to receive our check charging for one of the two entrees ordered. Upon asking our server he explained the menu restrictions, after expressing frustrations with not being alerted as others were to the limited menu he promptly and sincerely apologized and gave us a discount on the remaining bill. I was really pleased with both the food and our service, especially the calm way which the confusion was handled. The misunderstanding was not a blemish on the experience at all due to the great customer service we received. 

Giving it four out of five stars simply because I have one BBQ restaurant in Madison that based on food alone, I prefer over Brickhouse."}
{"text":"Far too expensive for mediocre barbecue.

I stopped by this place before the state basketball championships because a friend had a 2 for 1 coupon he and his brother were going to use. Talk about an unfunded mandate!

My other friend and I had to pay full price, and this is one of the few times I have had this kind of sticker shock for a meal. We ordered a drink apiece, a meal, and water, and it came to about $40 per person. The barbecue itself was similar to Smoky Jon's (vinegar based) at about twice the price. Since I prefer molasses based barbecue or dry rub, I'll not be eating here again.

The other strike against Brickhouse was that the service was terrible the time I went here. Our waitress was not very good, but I could tell she was par for the course in watching other tables and how they were served.

If I want barbecue near downtown Madison, I'll go to Famous Dave's or Fat Jack's instead."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Brisket sandwich was dry, and I don't understand why filling it with greasy onion rings is supposed to be a good thing. Sauces, which I had to ask for, were less than exciting. Parking is difficult. Probably won't be back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great brisket sandwiches.  Great beer and whiskey selection."}
{"text":"They've gotten a lot better since they first opened! The view is wonderful on the patio in the summer. Everything is delicious. We came on new year's eve and used a groupon. The sever was attentive and prompt. My boyfriend loved the nachos with brisket."}
{"text":"Their ribs are tender, fall-off-the-bone deliciousness. They have three good house sauces from which to choose. I just wish that they had a spicy sauce as an option. The best Bloody Mary that I've had in years. Fun and relaxed environment. I'm sure that I'll come back for more. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"No complaints here.  The place is beautiful!   The  food is great with huge portions.  The beer is cold.  There were three of us that went and we had the pulled pork dinner, 1/2 rack of ribs and the brisket sandwich.  For sides we sampled fries, spicy green beans and cheese grits.  The spicy green beans were my least favorite.  I did not find them spicy and they were not cooked long enough for me.  Cheese grits were really good and so are the fries.  They bring you a sample of sauces - house, vinegar and a mustard one.  They were all good, but my favorite was the house.  Our service was good, and the setting is really nice.  We were too full for dessert, but that looked good too!"}
{"text":"The brisket sandwich was tender, juicy, delicious. Chicken sandwich not quite as good, but tasty anyway. Great selection of tap beers, worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place lacked class from the initial walk-in. After 50+minutes of waiting for a table to seat out group of 8, it ONLY took 20 minutes to take our order. Once ordered, it only took OVER an hour and 15 minutes to get the actual food. The food was maybe average at best. Don't waste your time here. Stick to the Great Dane or Walmart if you want service. This place lacks class and service."}
