{"text":"Being a student, I am able to obtain a discount ( the total coming out to approximatively 15$ for me or maybe less) by only showing my Opus Card and nothing more! It's a fun place to go with a group of friends, therefore offering a wide variety of sushi including coconut and mango sushi ( yeah haha). Unfortunately, unless we are paying 20$ if I do recall, we are able to order the whole menu, or else we aren't able to have access to some sushis & other food in this all-you-can-eat restaurant. Also, second time I went there, I had a feeling that the sushis weren't as fresh and delicious as the first time I visited the place. Still, for it being a little cheaper than other all-you can eat places, thumbs up!"}
{"text":"we went there several times, both at dinner and lunch. The dinner is more expensive, but have more choice and more expensive food ( e.g. geoduck sashimi, my all time favorite sashimi;) lunch price is more affordable but the menu is more restricted, well still diverse enough for a good meal. What I like the most is that they dont only offer sushi and sashimi like certain sushi place, but also kitchen hot dishes such as dimsum and teriyaki. For those who are not sushi fan, still worth trying their hot dishes. Not to neglect the sushis coz still they are the best, always freshly made (you can watch them make it at the sushi bar) and well presented (lots of decorations we never eat haha). A trademark would be the mangue croustillant, salade crevette and the 999 rolls, which we enjoy all the time. I remember once we went there with my friend at lunch, she started crying while eating, we asked her what happened, she said it was just too delicious, haha that summarize pretty well our experience at 999. The service is also great, the staffs are super helpful and nice, they dont speak french so well but at least we know they are trying, c'est l'intention qui compte!:D defnitely recommend sushi 999 to all, sushi lovers or not;)"}
{"text":"worst service ever experienced!!!!! very incompetent and rude staff for extremely average sushi. And not that cheap."}
{"text":"Probably the best bring your own wine (BYOW) all you can eat (AYCE) sushi in town.  I love how they actually make the sushi per order, which can take some time though. Get ready for a 20min wait for your sushi. In the meantime, order the seaweed salad and soup they are really great.  I only write this review because many people seem to complain about the time it takes to get orders. If you want industrial AYCE, go to sushi st-denis or kanda, you can even order sushi by the piece there (never a good sign imho).  It's definitely not the best sushi in town, but it's an all you can eat. I find it coming second only to Ginza which is my #1! But Sushi 999 is just amazing for the value (bring your own wine!:) AND you get sashimi for lunch time aswell!!! Very few others do it (Kanda=crap, Sushi palace = decent).  But what I really love above all is how friendly they are. I don't like mayo, and they never complained about me asking to leave it out. They ever came back to me regarding a tempura something that may have some on it.  I would recommend this place to someone who's on a budget, wants pretty good sushi, likes sashimi (decent sized, fresh, and it seems more juicy than other AYCE), and especially if you want to bring your own wine! :)"}
{"text":"This place just got fined for mice and vermin. Stay away. http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2015/07/17/rongeurs-a-volonte-au-sushi-999"}
{"text":"Great service and very friendly.  A happening young crowd.   The all you can eat special is amazing and great valuefor less than $25.   Try the sushi 999 roll."}
{"text":"Sushi was awful.  It's not run or made by real Japanese.  They are Chinese and know nothing about making sushi or sashimi.  Staff was rude.  We couldn't eat the awful sushi so we threw it away and they wanted to charge us extra because we didn't finish it.  How are we supposed to eat something that taste like crap?  They told us if we couldn't finish it, that we couldn't just thrash it.  What are they going to do with it?  Give it to the next customer?  Service was horrible.  They all run around with an attitude on their faces.  We sat by where they made the sushi and it just looked awful the way they were making it.  If you've ever sat and watched a real sushi chef, you would know how awful these guys were.  They barely gave us any wasabi or ginger.  We keep having to ask several time. They only have water and they didn't even want to give us more water when we finished ours glass.  The food was salty to make you drink and get bloated. You also have to bring your own drinks/alcohol.   I will never go back to this place again!"}
{"text":"By far, the worst sushi place I have been to.  I would like to give them a one star and I don't think I'd like to give them another chance.  Friendly service but speed of sushi delivery is horrible.  This place seems to be busy and it's bring your own alcohol.  Students also get a discount.  If you truly love sushi, you will know this is not the place by pure observation and presentation.  The taste speaks for itself and the rice isn't sticky enough and falls apart.  If you check my other posts, you will know where my favorite sushi place in Montreal is."}
{"text":"I came to Sushi 999 with high expectations, based on the reviews here (hoping that the one negative review was due to that person arriving before the restaurant was in \"prime time\", as that reviewer generously noted).  However, I did come at prime time (a little after 6pm on a Wed night) and was disappointed. The tempura was really greasy, not crispy. The sushi rolls had lots and lots of mayo on them, and tasted more like mayo than anything else. The ice roll was probably the highlight from the night, as it used a mango sauce instead of straight-up mayo, and the rice paper wrapping was unusual and good.  I also tried to order the green dragon (though they brought me the red dragon, and it wasn't worth attempting to fix the confusion), the spider roll (which was fine, but a little greasy), and the tamago (which tasted like it had been made earlier in the week; spongy and flavorless).  My friends did have good things to say about the sweet potato roll, but were not particularly impressed by any of the other things they ordered (vegetarian dumpling; spring roll; salmon donburi; sweet tofu sushi; veggie tempura; a noodle dish; chicken teriyaki; beef-wrapped asparagus).  We ordered mango ice cream for dessert, and while it was orange, it didn't taste of mango at all and was really icy in consistency.  One funny thing about this restaurant is it's hard to predict the size of the items you order: for example, the beef-wrapped asparagus and the spring roll come as one tiny piece each (comically tiny, it was impressive!), but if you order the vegetarian tempura you get a whole basket full (and the same is true of the noodle dishes or donburi). When we left, we felt like we'd just eaten a lot of grease---not what I look for when I go out for sushi and drop $25.  For all-you-can-eat, Crescent Sushi is more impressive."}
{"text":"The lowest quality all you can eat sushi place I have been to so far.   Rolls filled with day-old tempura crust. Overly dressed iceberg lettuce that hasn't even been cut.  Tiny pieces of real fish. Overly battered tempura. Freezer dumplings. Gross cooked fish.  I did go at the beginning of the day and they clearly were not ready.  Still, the food was really hard to eat and I left without wanting to even try to find something good.   Good service though."}
{"text":"I arrived there today only to find out that they have been closed permanently. Scary!! I wonder why they closed??"}
{"text":"By far far the worst all you can eat sushi place. Service was super slow. Had to wait almost 20 min before waiter just came to serve us water. Food was 0 stars. Sushi were falling apart. And it felt like they just took sushi out of  fridge and put them under steam to make them look fresh. Please please don't don't waist your money. This place is so bad that I still remember it lol. I was there like year ago. There are so many other all you can eat sushi places that are by far better. Lol and price is like same as in other places. Doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited so long despite there being practically no one in the restaurant. He made no effort to even smile and we had to wait so long to order. Food wasn't the best either. Would never go back."}
{"text":"Do not come to this place.  Service was HORRIBLE!!! I wish I could give negative review.  The owner or the manager was dishonest and totally unfriendly.  He did not even bother to smile.  Absolutely nothing special about the sushi.  Truthfully,  I wouldnt even consider them sushi.   The place is run by some Chinese people who has no idea what sushi is."}
{"text":"We had the worst sushi ever. Found a hair in our sushi and no one to help with the menu, no explanations about the card(the card doesn't say whats in the sushi rolls) the waiter was not polite because of the question we asked about the menu. I dont recommend this place to anyone who is used to eat sushi or to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a lovely night out with a group of Yelpers here. Having been warned that Montreal is not a sushi town, and that all-you-can-eat sushi buffets here can be kind of dicey, I was going in with low expectations. However, I really enjoyed the meal (and not just the excellent company!).  Rice and fish were decent, on par with some of the more expensive places around town and much better than, say, Sushi Shop. Salmon and white tuna sashimi were available at weekday supper (not at lunch except on weekends) and red tuna was available in a roll only.  Lots of cooked food options (including dim sum) for those, like my husband, who would rather avoid seaweed and raw fish.  Service was fast despite being in a large group, and food came out just as soon as we had finished the last plateful. The hot dishes were served piping hot. We were offered a bucket of ice for our wine as well as little cups for our sake. There were a few little glitches with our orders but we certainly all had more than enough to eat.  Special thanks to Mark G. for the introduction to beef sashimi. As a fan of rare roast beef, I can't believe I had never tried this before.  My favourite part was when the waiter encouraged us to order a second round of dessert! So sad that I was too full for mango ice cream."}
{"text":"much better than last time I came. Makis are awesome and they have many new choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Service déplorable, malgré des sushis correctes. J'ai été beaucoup déçu par la qualité des produits et l'ambiance du restaurant. De plus, la femme qui s'occupe de la caisse a eu le culot de me demander un pourboire plus conséquent que ce que je lui avais donné. Je n'y retournerais pas."}
{"text":"Sushi 999 is a BYOB AYCE sushi restaurant. The service on that evening: only two waitresses for the whole restaurant and it was packed. Sashimi are to be avoided. They don`t know what is sashimi: the cuts are disgusting bad and destroyed the quality of the meat. The bathrooms are cleaner now, but still a lot to do (the restaurant got fined in July for the presence of rats, mice and filth in the restaurant). The price? 23 ish, 25 with taxes (in the evening), but they had mussels."}
{"text":"Sushi à volonté ! Très bon dans l'ensemble. Le bémol est pour le service assez peu accueillant et meme pas un merci au moment de partir. Mais si vous voulez manger en quantité pour pas chère cela peut etre un bon plan"}
{"text":"I used to work there for several months.I don't want to talk too much here.But for your health,avoid this place.Trust me."}
{"text":"La première fois que nous avons commandé là relève plus du hasard et du \"on tente on verra bien\" que du coup de coeur pour le prospectus, collé sur notre frigidaire à notre arrivée dans notre nouvel appart....  Maintenant, on commande au moins une fois par semaine le Party Tray A à faire livrer (je n'ai jamais été dans le resto : on commande toujours la livraison). Ce plateau est juste énorme (42 pièces), et, tout est à base de poissons ! Des pièces de sashimis énormes, des makis au poisson, des sushis, bref, on sait pourquoi on paye : pour du poisson !! Pas pour des makis au surimi et légumes (quand il y a du surimi) comme on voit très souvent à Montréal ! Bref, vraiment une très bonne découverte, et les fois où nous en mangeons d'autres que ceux-là, nous regrettons toujours un peu notre Party Tray A !!  Révision : de 5 étoiles, passe à 3, après la découverte de 2 autres restaurants de sushis, proches et bien meilleurs"}
{"text":"Everything I wrote previously still stands true.  I have not found another sushi buffet with as great value and little rice!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from this place. They sent one wrong item, and when I called they offered to bring me the right item, but told them it was alright. I ordered shrimp salad sushi, sashimi and shrimp dumplings. Instead of the shrimp dumplings they brought me fish cake skewers, which were actually good. The service at this place is awesome, and their prices are fair. I would never order take-out sushi from any other place. The quality, service and price is unbeatable. My only issue is that their minimum order amount for delivery is $25. Would order from them more frequently if they lowered it to $18"}
{"text":"Certains disent que le service est peu accueillant.  Bon, on n'est pas au Reine Elizabeth, hein. Ça va, quand même, pour un immense restaurant de sushi à volonté. Nous étions quatre, nous avons été accueillis immédiatement par un serveur des plus souriants, qui nous a accompagnés toute la soirée.   Disons qu'il faut savoir ce que l'on veut, sinon, on peut y passer la nuit (quoique c'est permis).  On peut manger POUR TOUJOURS! Et que dire de ce merveilleux concept qu'est celui de la possibilité d'apporter nos propres consommations alcoolisées? Un mariage adorable. Sushi et vin blanc, POUR LE RESTE DE TA VIE!   Le décor est loin d'être à tout casser et, parlant de casser, des enfants nous ont cassé les oreilles une partie de la soirée. Puisque les capacités parentales des géniteurs / accompagnateurs qui étaient présents semblaient moindres, je n'aurais pas dit non à une petite intervention de la part du personnel lorsque les bambins ont décidé non seulement de courir partout dans le restaurant et dans la section des toilettes (à l'extérieur du restaurant, mais dans le même bâtiment, je vous rassure), mais aussi s'asseoir / se coucher où bon leur semblait, quand bon leur semblait. J'ai failli leur tendre un vilain croc-en-jambe.   Autre moment cocasse (not): Ma copine a eu un malaise pendant le repas (ce n'est pas la faute du restaurant et de ce que nous avons mangé, je tiens à le préciser) et le personnel a été très aimable à son égard. Je leur dédie une étoile!   J'y retournerai, puisque c'est bon, le prix est très raisonnable pour un resto sushi à volonté (30$ par personne), on peut apporter notre alcool et le Sushi 999 est situé à un endroit très central et facile d'accès en transport en commun. C'est un OUI!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. The sushi is not bad. The pricing is set up to make the all you can eat option the far and away best choice.  The service here is not great, in keeping with most every all-you-can-eat sushi place you have ever been to.  The shrimp tempura, green dragon roll, and tuna sushi options are my favourite.  If you are not looking to gorge on sushi, you might want to skip this. Otherwise, it is not bad, and they do allow you to bring your own wine."}
{"text":"Hey hey it's A-Ok! For All You Can Eat sushi in Montreal this spot on St Denis and Sherbrooke meets your needs. The fish is fresh and service is fast and friendly. The room feels nice, unpretentious, lots of windows. The menu numbers and the numbers on the order sheet seem a bit different so just double check what you're ordering. Personally I'd avoid anything except the sushi - there's a lot of other stuff on the menu, some of which we tried, none of which seemed notable to me. Simple fresh rolls in large quantities to accompany the beer and sake you byo makes for a really fun meal with friends."}
{"text":"I have tried 3 other sushi places and have always been greatly disappointed. A friend recommended this one and I decided to give it a chance before I gave up looking for affordable, tasty sushi in this city. I must say this place is good quality for the price. First off, you can't really expect the best sushi when it's \"all you can eat\" but this place had a good variety, it wasn't just crab and shrimp. The food was fresh, we were treated well by the employees, it's BYOB and truly all you can eat, including deserts :) not bad for $25 a person! Not the best sushi, but the best without breaking your wallet that I've found in the plateau."}

{"text":"Sushi 999 is one of the few all-you-can-eat sushi places in the area. I went there for lunch out of sushi craving (and with low expectations), but I was very disappointed by both the food and the poor service.  The food tasted stale because of the ingredients were terrible. The fish they used were obviously kept in the freezer for way too long, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's expired.   The service was also very poor. The waitress ignored the entire section for 15 minutes, and I had to walk up to her to get service. It wasn't like she was busy serving other customers, she just chose to prep the tables in the other empty section instead. The manager/cashier also just sat there and didn't bother filling in for her.   The only reason I gave this place a 2-star rating instead of 1 is because I know how few all-you-can-eat sushi places there are in Montreal, and so I'm being extra generous when it comes to scoring the food."}
{"text":"I personally am not going back here after I read this: http://montreal.eater.com/2015/7/20/9003367/montreal-sushi-999-restaurant-mice  Be careful.."}
{"text":"Yuck!  http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2015/07/17/rongeurs-a-volonte-au-sushi-999  I'm not a big fan of all you can eat sushi  and I didn't bother coming back to this restarant anyway. What shocks me is the complaint about the cleanliness of the restaurant came in January 2014. It took one year and a half to fine the owners...... What other places the population of Montreal is visiting without suspecting there are similar problems."}
{"text":"http://montreal.eater.com/2015/7/20/9003367/montreal-sushi-999-restaurant-mice  yeah, so dont go until they have sorted out their problems!!"}
{"text":"I have been there once. The food and service were Okay. I don't think I will go back because of the rat problem. That's so disgusting."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're expecting decent sushi and good service. If I could give them negative rating I would. Food was mediocre to horrible (fried California roll was gross). We sat across from where they make sushi, and they kept looking at us. They just stared the heck out of us and didn't even turn away when we looked back. It was a really uncomfortable experience and the service was pretty slow too (had to keep asking for water and napkins). Never going back and don't come unless you don't mind some stares and horrible sushi."}
{"text":"If you crave sushi and lots of it, then this is the place for you. It's all you can eat, BYOB (bring your own bottle), inexpensive place. It's perfect for lunch or dinner with friends or family gatherings. It's not exactly the best place to have a date and not the place to go if you know your sushi (the quality is just okay). However, I still recommend this place if you're on a budget and sushi is on your mind.  I also recommend to book a table few hours in advance for Friday and Saturday dinners as it can get quite busy and you may end up waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend, I needed my sushi fix while I was in Montreal, so essentially the AYCE that is offered here is from what I've seen from many locations, very extensive - there are like 100+ items one can choose - for the price it's not bad; the sashimi is pretty good, not the best but pretty good - tried the kalbi which wasn't bad - honestly I can't complain. The bathroom is kinda weird you need to ask for a key it is within a shared complex, bathroom was kinda broken down-   My girlfriend is not into the AYCE, so she ordered from the a la carte, she was upset the location didn't offer pad thai, while there was a thai place next door **maybe offer some thai /fusion goods,   she ordered a seafood fried rice and chicken teriyaki, the chicken was pretty good but the fried rice while was huge in portion, it lacked seafood like 6 shrimps, if you offer it on the AYCE, why be stingy with it for a la carte customers."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative review I would. I went in to get all you can eat. Food isn't half bad, but the service is horribly slow. And honestly, for ayce, speed is of the essence. I sat there waiting for about 10 minutes for a few rolls of my first round. I've been waiting over 25 freaking minutes and some rolls still haven't come.   What gives?  Edit: they finally came. 30 minutes later. Really? For salmon rolls?"}
