{"text":"Shame. Stay far away. Price gouging at its best. $10.00 for a pint of Sam Adams. I guess when you are past security you charge whatever you want. Highest price I have ever paid for a beer in an airport in Madison Wisconsin."}
{"text":"It's obvious the restaurant is working on its service, it was excellent and not at all like past reviews.  I was there right as they opened and greeted by both ladies, served promptly.    The service raised the score, the negatives are all on the food. First, two of the items on the breakfast menu (out of 6 options) were not available.  No pancakes and no waffles? Come on, I'm carbo loading for my flight! Also, as mentioned in other reviews, the sourdough sucked (white bread) and the hash browns were poor."}
{"text":"Slow service. Over priced. $10 for a light beer? $30 for a beer and bland chicken sandwich for lunch is unacceptable. This is Madison. Not Chicago. Will never stop here again or recommend it."}
{"text":"They ran out of croutons, so I didn't get any on my salad... How does that even happen, they're virtually non-perishable! Whoever's in charge of inventory needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Really bad. Terribly slow and from other reviews seems it is understaffed. From  a supposedly renowned chef, the food is horrendous. Dirty plate, cool food and greasy as hell. The hash browns were pretty much a oil slick, undercooked eggs, plain cold white bread toast.....stay away! Sad I tried it as it is also overpriced."}
{"text":"Horrible... only one star, and that was because A) the service was not atrocious, and B) Yelp doesn't allow zero stars.  Chicken Parmesan is one of the most expensive items in their menu, and should be hard to mess up.  I was wrong.  Super dry due to being over-fried.  Served with no sauces add flavor or moisture.  Completely inedible.  Then I had their calamari, which was served without lemon or marinara... alone, it was okay, but one would think that at a gastropub might understand the basics of the dishes they are trying, and failing, to serve.    If it weren't for the fact that the airport has a captive audience, this restaurant would have failed a week after opening.  Instead, they get to torture hapless travelers ceaselessly, with little fear of being closed down.  DO NOT EAT HERE!  Just guy buy a bag of chips, and eat at your connection."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Menu has a decent selection. Drinks are overpriced, but it's at an airport so that's not really uncommon. Probably one of the better options at this airport."}
{"text":"I need to realize a James beard award is a clue for an overhyped meal.  Their attempt at fancy missed the mark in all 3 meals.  The hash browns for my classic breakfast were any thing but classic.  And the toast was not sourdough but a thick piece of rye.  Companion's putine tasted like layers of Prepared stuff purchased from SAMs club and warmed for serving."}
{"text":"I was at MSN for a mid morning flight and stopped at Mad Town for breakfast. After seating myself it was seven minutes until I was greeted by the server. She asked for my drink order and I have my breakfast order at the same time. The iced tea she returned with I could tell was brewed because of the bitter coffee taste to it. The eggs were as requested over medium, the sausage and hash browns were also cooked correctly, the bacon and toast were both over cooked. The service was intermittent. I would only eat here again because it's the only option in the airport."}
{"text":"I seldom write reviews on airport vendors since they all tend to be mediocre but mad town gastro is different. It's new and bright and food is actually good. Had the classic breakfast before flight. 2 eggs, sausages, hash brown and toast. Unlike other places, the food is not as greasy or too heavy before a flight. The hash brown is crispy and flat - not the soggy kind. The sausages are tasty. All in all a good place to grab a bite before flight."}
{"text":"I have to say this was not good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner and I have tried all 3 here. The servers don't know how to prioritize, food is just plain overpriced and gnarly. The breakfast sandwich had way too many flavors none of which went together. The chef doesn't poach eggs. Enough said."}
{"text":"I didn't even get to try the food at Mad Town Gastropub, so this review is only based on their service. I pulled up to the bar looking to find something to eat to settle my upset stomach before boarding my flight. All I wanted was tomato soup and grilled cheese. Both items were on the menu, but the bartender was not willing to sell them to me unless I bought the full grilled cheese kids meal as well as the soup and salad combo. That would have been an excessive amount of food that would go to waste and would also cost far too much. I had even asked if I could just purchase a side of soup which she also turned down. Instead she sent me across the way to a coffee shop which she said had soup and sandwiches (turns out they didn't have soup).  As a former server & bartender I find it hard to believe someone would turn away business like that. It's not hard to put a side of soup in or sub out French fries for soup with a sandwich. As a server or bartender, I would always try to help out a patron especially if they weren't feeling well! Where is your Wisconsin spirit!??  I fly in and out of Madison frequently and will never be returning here and I recommend you don't either. I will be grabbing food at my connection instead.   #badservice #lazy #goelsewhere"}
{"text":"The service is soooooooo sllooowww. Be ready to wait. There were 4 servers present. 2 were at the entrance folding napkins when we entered and it told k over 7 minutes for someone to come to our table. The cheese curds are amazing! The beer was cold, but BUYER BEWARE there are no prices for alcohol posted. It was $10.49 for a glass of beer!"}
{"text":"Decent food but extremely awful service. I was like the only person in the restaurant and it took them 10 minutes to even acknowledge my presence. One of the waitresses was just folding napkins on the table next to me and didn't even say hello. I was just kind of sitting there.   I got the classic breakfast and everything was actually pretty good for airport food. A little more on the expensive side but what do you expect. It took forever to come out though - I was sitting there for a good half an hour.    But the lack of service just left a bad taste for me."}
{"text":"Not too sure what everyone is on about here. I found this little place pleasant at 8AM.   I took a look at the menu and did not fancy breakfast. So I asked the waitress if the Korean Style Sandwich was available. She went and asked the cook and they said no problem!!!   And you know what? It was good. Really good. Surprisingly good. It was crunchy, juicy, and sauced perfectly. The bun was sort of like a pretzel bun and soft warm and delicious. I enjoyed it very much. The fries were crunchy and warm/salty on the outside and tender on the inside. Perfectly cooked.   Top it off with a morning beer to wash it down right before getting on a plane? Well. How could this not be a good experience.   Staff are 10/10!! So very high marks there.   If I am back in Madison. I will be back to eat here."}
{"text":"Soooooo, 2 stars for the braut which was better than average and 1 imaginary star for our server who seemed to be the only person working.  I watched a guy sitting at the bar politely ask an employee kneeling in the fridge for a drink and the guy very rudely said he's not working and walked away. Easily in the top 5 most rude encounters I've seen at a restaurant from any employee ever. Next I watched another employee who disappeared from the bar for about 5 minutes walk back as if there weren't 10 people waiting to be served.   If I'm ever in this airport again, this is a last resort spot unless there's a good sports event since they have a decent amount of tvs."}
{"text":"The \"Ultimate Waffle\" was decent! It was a nice little cafe conveniently located in the center of the boarding gates. No complaints."}
{"text":"So it was between the Korean Sandwich and their fish and chips. It says on the menu that their fish and chips is a \"favorite\". The waitress recommended that and said\"they have really good food here\" so I went with that. I asked which is heartier as some places give you a little minnow and a boat load of fries ( there cheaper). She says that she'd make sure the fish would be plentiful. It was meh. Now the boat load of fries were horrible. If they blanch them here, they didn't do this right and I only had a few and then left it. What a waste of over $20. Avoid this place if at all possible."}
{"text":"Only thing good about this place is the tomato basil soup. The food is average, but everything is way overpriced - even for airport food which you expect to be overpriced. But the prices here are ridiculous. Unfortunately, options are very limited at DCRA."}
{"text":"I stopped there with my daughter she ordered a drink and I ordered a soda the soda was flat the bartender would not take the drink with flat soda off our bill.  A $12 drink that was awful because the soda was flat.  Service is slow so make sure you ask for your bill or you may kiss your flight   One star is generous    I would not go back here again when I fly which is weekly"}
{"text":"Gnarled up food and even gnarlier stale coffee. The $11 breakfast sandwich was like Texas toast meets a McGriddle with a bunch of broken-up syrupy tator tots added for filler. I'd expect this from a high college student, but Tory Miller?   Skip it for breakfast."}
{"text":"Horrible service, very slow. They need to realize this is an airport and people don't have all day."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers and some interesting menu items beyond the usual airport fare. But the beer is wildly overpriced even for an airport bar - $11 a pint?.  And unfortunately, the chicken in my chicken sandwich was undercooked and chewy.  Chewy is not a good description for chicken.   Which was unfortunate because the fries were good and the avocado and arugula on the fresh bun were good. A little more attention to detail would make this a solid place for an airport meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese curds burger and it was alright. It's a bit expensive for the quality and they charge to add fries instead of their potato chips. The servers were slow and it wasn't terribly crowded. The only thing it has going for it is that it is really the only restaurant at this airport."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this spot every time I visit MSN. Today I had a side salad with a cup of tomato basil soup. The portions were generous. Jenna at the bar was really kind."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a flight.  Had to flag down a waitress after a long wait for a menu.  Then after ordering it took forever to bring the food out.  It was so bad the waitress comped our drinks without asking for anything.  I was surprised the service was so slow and lackadaisical as there were less than half the tables occupied and there were lots of waitresses in the place.  Each had maybe two tables to serve.  Had the burger and enjoyed it.  The lady had a salad and they put the wrong dressing on it."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service at this place is so horrible it gets a 1 even with good food. There is a culture of slow, slovenly,\"not my job\" service here. I watched as multiple people came in the place, sat for up to 10 minutes without so much as a greeting, and left. This happened with 7 employees in the place and less than 15 customers!"}
{"text":"Horrible Service!  I'd like to say something about the food, but I haven't tried it yet because BOTH times I've ordered food it took so long to deliver that I had to leave for my flight before I got to lay my eyes on it.  Today, me and another guy sat at the bar for 15 minutes before anyone even talked to us."}
{"text":"For airport food, this was pretty good. I like that all of the concessions in the Madison airport are local. I had a breakfast sandwich on sourdough that came out hot, fast, and tasty. It was a big portion. The service is a little strange--a lot of the staff sits around in the restaurant waiting for customers, but they greeted me promptly."}
{"text":"After what seemed like a long remodel, Mad Town Gastropub is open!  The look and layout is clean, bright, and open. Bar is equipped with USB ports, de rigueur in airports these days, and, even better, coat hooks. Coat hooks should be part of the building code here, where some kind of coat is needed about 7 months out of the year. USBs reside under the bench seats as well.   Service was great. Helen dropped off my check right away, always appreciated at an airport restaurant.   I really liked the breakfast sandwich. Tasty and filling (which it should be at $10.99), it's served with a delicious Korean sauce which absolutely makes the sandwich. The bacon I picked was very good quality, or you can pick ham or sausage.   The free to go cup for your Ancora coffee is a nice touch.   The only disappointment for me is the AB InBev dominance on the tap list. They have some local brews, but I'd rather see visitors to Madison greeted with more of our local specialties, and less Shock Top, Bud Light, and Goose Island. That's a corporate office thing though, and not a big strike against MadTown Gastropub."}
{"text":"Just ate here! Horrible food. Greasy and no flavor. Ordered the pork belly sliders and with some aioli. Food came with fat dripping from plate to table! Took a bite and it's tough and no flavor, not even salted, I didn't taste any aioli! And it has a smell! I do know how to cook pork belly as I am Asian and that wasn't how it's cook! And it says on menu it's created by some chef! Only good about is is the fries! I complained and manager didn't let me pay so that's a plus and said the chef is training new cook! Well, cook doesn't know what she is doing!"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"famous\" cheese curd burger and a side house salad. I waited almost an hour before receiving my food only to find out that the lettuce in the salad and on the burger was wilted. The burger--ordered medium--was well done. After bringing up the issue to the waitress, she only offered to issue me a refund for the food. She failed to ask me if i can get a remade meal. The food is sub-par and over priced. #curdblunder"}
{"text":"Absolutely, utterly worst customer service ever! I travel a lot for work and have been to quite a few airport establishments. After seating myself at the bar, about 5 minutes later I was finally greeted by the bartender. I couldn't decide between a salad (best option) or famous cheese curds. I asked the bartender how big the cheese curds were because I wanted a salad. After a very vague hand gesture he said something incomparable. I opted for the curds, come on, I'm in Wisconsin! And I ordered a blue martini from the menu. I asked for slightly extra dirty with 3 blue cheese olives. Now at the risk of sounding like a snob to non-martini drinkers, he brought me a drink with 4 crappy olives. About 5-10 min later, when he finally came towards my end of the bar, not to check on me, I asked him about his blue cheese olives. He said \"no, we don't have those\". Oh wait! Forgot to tell you it took him about 15 min to find a glass to put my martini in. He decided to put it in a cocktail glass, guess no martini glasses were clean. And from the looks of him he didn't like anything clean. Bottom line way too long for a crap drink.  My curds came out about 2 min after I got my drink. He was extremely unaccommodating, didn't know how to make a drink and absolutely rubbish at customer service/interaction. I left his a $2 tip. Never in my life have I left anyone a $2 tip! I've been there and know how it works. Servers, bartenders make shit and they deserve more money for dealing with people but man, Dylan was an absolute rubbish, worst ever, bartender.  If you do go here please tip on actuality of service because this kid needs a wake up call or the company needs to actually train their staff.  Either way, I could be starving and dying of thirst. Wouldn't go back. Oh, and to top things off, the guy next to me just walked out because service was shot. And the guy on my other side ordered a chicken sandwich. Dylan brought out a fried chicken sandwich. The customer said he thought it was grilled, because it didn't state and the bartender never asked. He returned it, promptly picked at it. He told me it was shit as well as the service. I concurred. He left in a hurry because he didn't tip and felt bad.  I didn't feel bad. Never have I ever and I won't again! Mad Town Gastro? I think not!"}
{"text":"If you want a $20 glass of crappy house wine with only one server/bartender for the whole restaurant - not his fault, but the service was so slow I was already boarding by the time I got my check and had to run - this place is for you..."}
{"text":"Not many options at Dane County Airport after security, unfortunately.   Of the choices for food, this has the widest selection. Everything is sadly just overpriced airport food called a \"Gastropub\". Everything tasted like microwave reheated fare. Chicken was rubbery and over cooked, probably due to said microwave. Calamari was heavy on the breading.    Wine list are your supermarket cooler staples. Beer list is likewise gas station cooler staples.   Service is slow, but friendly.   Tip: there are some tables with power outlets on the long bench in the very front.   Warning: they close at 7:30pm, so eat early if you are planning on food after security."}
{"text":"I can see how this place can be hit or miss. I sat here for a couple hours, had a drink and food. Jed seems very good and Anne doesn't. She served me. I ordered just a soup and salad. She asked if I wanted vinaigrette or ranch, like they only have 2 dressings. I asked for the vinegrette, she brought a lemon vinegrette which I didn't like, I pushed it aside, hardly touched. Anne came to swipe my plate and I stopped her and told her that I didn't care for the dressing so she replaced my salad. That was nice. It took her about 15 minutes to notice the salad and I am sitting at the bar, in front of her. She asked if I wanted the brown vinegrette which might have been a question before she gave me the lemon. The dressing was very dark but I tried it, still not a winner. I pushed my plate aside again. She stopped back and asked if I was done with the salad. I said yes and left it there. I then want to pay and go and I put my card in the glass with my bill. Jed noticed it right away and probably could have done it 3 times before Anne finally came over. Sad Service from Anne. Jed ran circles around her. The food is hit and miss here by reading reviews and I see why. Jed took care of me better than she did. He even noticed right away that my card was there and WA nice enough to tell me that Anne would get that soon. He didn't realize she was that slow."}
{"text":"Mad Town does a decent job for an airport pub and opens early (for those of us who choose the 5:45AM flight). Short wait times and solid food. I only experienced their breakfast, but was very impressed with the portion i received.   With only 30 minutes before boarding, I was in and out with time to spare."}
{"text":"I ordered the Local Cheese and Charcuterie plate. Hm, sounds good, despite the whopping $18 price. The menu promises a variety of meats and cheeses, sour dough bread, whole grain mustard and marmalade.   What I got was pretty short of that -- sliced bread toast (probably from what they use at breakfast), no marmalade, literally a few crumbs of blue (did they run out and just use the crumbles they use for their salad?), no \"whole grain\" mustard (and they used ketchup as a substitute), etc.   Pretty poor, and far worse than their menu description. If they just made a sandwich out of it, it would cost half as much (and it would still be poor). It's false advertising, extremely over-priced, and I wouldn't have ordered it if they had been accurate."}
{"text":"I sat down and was ignored for 15 minutes. Servers made no eye contact. Got up and walked away"}
{"text":"One of the worst value meals I have ever had, even applying airport standards. $40: 1 poor quality chicken sandwich, 1 med sized acceptable soup, side salad, 1 beer."}
{"text":"I don't think an airport restaurant can get much better. The service is fast and friendly (thanks Shannon!) and the food is excellent. I had the beet salad and it was delicious. The woman next to me told the waitress that her BLT was the best she ever had. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Service is terrible- hence the one star. Jennifer totally forgot about us so we had to ask other servers for our drinks, ketchup, mayo- we even asked her for our check and she said to go to the bartender for it bc she forgot we were her table. So awkward. $60 for two beers and two sandwiches. Mine was ok (a little cold). Meh."}
{"text":"Solid pub food. They have healthy options here and so far I have been happy with the options. The salad was fresh with the dressing on the side. The side of chicken was dry but not too much, a dip of dressing and water helped ease it down. The side of chips is nice and crispy. There must be a thing about home made chips in Wisconsin because I don't usually see this option other places. I liked them with a splash of vinegar. The chocolate cake was very good. I was craving dark chocolate and could have easily eaten twice as much but my belt was already straining from the week. Next time I am waiting for a flight and need a bit of food coma, I will stop in here. Bonus you can walk away with your cocktail."}
{"text":"If you want a really bad attitude from the server then this place is for you.  Laura was rude and it shocks me she is in a service industry that tips are a large part of her income.   I'm not one that tips lower than 20/% but with her I was tempted. Such a rude person.  The food was ok but wow the service was not. I would sit at the bar if you come here.  That way you don't have to deal with Laura."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast before catching a flight home. I was surprised and thankful that they open at 4:30 am...thank you! Many airports have early morning flights, but the restaurants don't open to serve the early morning passengers.    I ordered the breakfast plate with eggs, sausage, toast and hash browns. Everything was very good. The hash browns had too many peppers for my personal taste, but were still good. The service was good...thanks Pat. The diet Pepsi was flat and they tried another glass, but it was flat too. That happens and I understand.  My ticket before tip was $16.86."}
{"text":"Short wait times and quick service if you order to-go. Tried the pork belly sliders which were pretty tasty. The pork belly itself was a little bland, but the sauce made up for it. I'm not sure if it was worth the $15 as the portion sizes were pretty small."}
{"text":"This is one of the only restaurants in the Madison airport and if you don't want to waste your time dealing with terrible service, then I suggest you go somewhere else. I was not greeted by anyone when walking into the restaurant and when I asked if I should seat myself I was told to \"figure it out by looking at the sign.\"  My waitress helped few around me and left me and another table sitting there to wait. She took the order and then delivered the food and that's the last I saw of her.   The food was fine. The menu offered a small amount of options, but enough to make it all go together. If you're from out of town, you'll enjoy the Wisconsin themed brats, burgers, & curds.   When checking out, I asked two different waitresses if they could help me with paying my bill and they both told me \"I'd have to find my waitress\" and walked away.   I'm very disappointed in this restaurants hospitality and the attitude of their employees. Check out other reviews before coming here as others have experienced things similar to me. I think this restaurant has potential to be a great stop for tourists and those waiting at the airport if they fixed the service issues."}
{"text":"I usually have a great experience here, BUT NOT TODAY! First, I had to listen to the waitress walk around the restaurant broadcasting that management likes to staff her as the only server so she can give poor customer service. When I attempted to ask for help she immediately brushed me off and said she'd be back without even listening to what I needed. As I'm sitting there waiting for her to come back, she proceeded to clear tables and do everything else except come back to help me. I was so annoyed and disgusted by her attitude and behavior that I left my breakfast on the table and bought something to eat on the plane. At the end of the day, we all face pressures at work, but no one, especially busy travelers, want to hear people whine or deal with passive aggressive behavior when they're on the road trying to get to their destination!"}
{"text":"$9.50 for a pint? Are you joking? Don't ever go here. Food is pretty mediocre too. Also I'm pretty sure the only positive review here is a faker friend of management. Don't give this place your business. Any place that doesn't list prices on its menu should be illegal."}
{"text":"Nice stop at the Madison Airport, thank you for the hospitality. Side note: crab cakes were tasty however when I requested bread or crackers, rye bread was served...not a good flavor matching."}
{"text":"First off, there was too many customers and not enough staff. I ordered the balsamic chicken salad.  The portion was ok but the \"grilled\" chicken was chewy, rubbery and cold. I couldn't even eat it.  The waitress never came back to ask me how it was. She just dropped off the check after I was sitting there not eating. Even after I ate all the greens and not one bite of the chicken I told her the dilemma. She didn't even offer to discount my meal. I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I fly out of Madison probably 3 times a month.  I have given this place numerous chances and I am let down every time.  Bland disgusting food for top dollar.  Save yourself the hassle and eat before you come to the airport."}
{"text":"Probably the worst airport restaurant experience I've ever had. Only good thing was the staff. The food is more overpriced than you'd find at Chicago or other big cities. On top of that the grilled chicken sandwich was the blandest sandwich I've ever had with overcooked chips on the side. Save your $21 (cost with tip for the sandwich and chips) and go grab some snacks from vending and you'll be better off."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place after hating the Great Dane that used to be in its place (which had both bad food and bad service). I was so excited to finally try it after seeing the remodel and browsing the menu on a previous visit to the airport. Unfortunately, a lot of the reasons I disliked the Great Dane remained even after the renovation.  I stopped in for an early breakfast and there were only 6 or so other people in the restaurant at the time. Since I only had 30 minutes or so until my flight boarded, I sat at the bar hoping to have a bartender present so that I could order right away and get the check. Apparently they don't staff a bartender in the morning because a waitress from the dining room waited on me and there was nobody behind the bar.  I ordered the Classic Breakfast (eggs, hash browns, and toast) for $12. Not only did it take 20 minutes to arrive, it was a minimal amount of food and I was still hungry afterward. I ordered sourdough toast, but the other reviewers are correct-- it is some sort of plain white bread! The waitress served the toast dry, but did bring some butter and jelly once I asked for it.   It took another 10 minutes for me to flag down the waitress and pay the check, leaving me rushing to get to the gate.   I'll give them 2 stars (over the 1 star that the Dane got) because the interiors are nice and I'm still holding out hope that their dinner menu has improved based on menu content alone. I am disappointed Tori Miller was willing to put his name on a place with such bad service and they don't compare to his restaurants downtown that have great service."}
{"text":"Go here if you want to miss your plane. Service is horribly slow. Had to bail on the check cause the server was absolutely no where to be found and I had a plane to catch. Sat here for 40 minutes waiting for my food. 2 other parties bailed on their check too."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the food, this review would've started with \"avoid at all costs!\"  It was expensive, took forever to get my food, and despite my infinite patience, the waitress acted like I was an inconvenience.  This place sucks.  My burger was good, but it was kind of a hard thing to mess up.  If this place had ANY competition, they'd go broke."}
{"text":"Very typical airport stop. Not impressed but better than nothing.   The place always seems to be packed, but they open early and handle the crowd well!"}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner and my whole experience was superb! Service was great! I ate at the bar and was served by Matt. He recommended the Korean chicken sandwich and it was delicious! He was on top of refilling my water and kept a smile on his face."}
