{"text":"This place is decent, and I'd definitely recommend it over one of the Rio Mirages. The food is a bit on the pricy side for what they offer, and I prefer Popo's in Glendale. If I just need some quick Mexican food though, this place has always been satisfying."}
{"text":"Good local place for Mexican food. My family has visited at least 10 times since we moved to Surprise and the staff is good and the food portion size is excellent. Only reason not a 5 star is I am picky about my beverage and while they have a full bar, they don't carry Guinness. My wife does enjoy their Margaritas and this is an excellent place to stop if going to the movies or bowling alley."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best salsa and carne asada around, we like to have them cook it medium rare:) We also like their tacos and Enchiladas De Camaron. They also sale the salsa so you can take a big container of it home with you. Love the decor and service has always been good. The only reason  it didn't get 5 stars from me is because their chili renos are horrible, they taste like they were popped out of the freezer and have tons of soggy thick egg batter, and I have tried them several times hoping they would get better:/"}
{"text":"Wow... some people are just beyond miserable complaining about a menu set up, music and paying their bill. Whatever.. my husband and I enjoyed a DELICIOUS Sunday brunch on 5/3. We are normally aren't the biggest  fans of all-you-can-eats or even buffets but this was BY FAR the BEST we've both ever had. Not only did we get bottomless champagne, but the food selection on the brunch was incredible! Moist pork carnitas, BBQ ribs, fajitas, enchiladas, refried beans and various mexican sweet breads are just a few of the many treats we enjoyed. They even have someone making fresh corn tortillas! The LIVE MARIACHI band did seem loud at times, but it made the whole experience more fun and authentic I suppose... it's just in how you look at! Take it easy, enjoy some homemade mexican food coupled with great, friendly service and get to Las Fuentes! We LOVED it!!"}
{"text":"Sub Par experience but food tasted good.  We visited here for lunch.  It was not busy but I had to track someone down to seat us.  The waitress sat me at a dirty table that was dirty from the night before.  The service took a while even though there were only a few customers.  The food did taste really good but was served to us just warm so it was cold before we could finish.  I may try it again but probably not"}
{"text":"We will never return to this place!!  Food is cold, although the service is pretty good.  We went there today because they started a weekday buffet. It's not worth  $7.99! I tried to use an expired Coupon which they refused,  period!!  Although Groupon clearly states they must honor them  even after expired for what I paid.  We have been there several times for the Sunday brunch which is better but still not nothing special! I had purchased the Groupon to use for that.  I read every word to make sure there were no exclusions but when I tried to redeem it I  was informed it does not apply to Sunday brunch.  Don't buy their Groupons! Customer Service is bad and overall the food isn't worth the trip!!  MUCH MUCH better Mexican restaurants out there!!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Brunch today. The food was pretty good. But I was very disappointed in the service. We could hardly get someone to refill are drinks. But the worst was when we received the bill. They charged $6.98 each for the buffet for my 2 year old boys. And added an automatic gratuity of $11.23 for 5 people. $11.23 when we served ourselves and were only able to receive one refill on my water. Ridiculous!!! I only gave one star because the food was pretty good. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for the dinner buffet.  Not the best selection of food, but it was sitll pretty good.  I stuck with the chicken fajita mixture which was pretty good and some kind of green chili chicken.  The beans looked like they had been sitting out for a while though so i stayed away from those.  The rice was pretty standard mexican rice, but still adequate.  The salsas were good, but they didnt offer any chips, which i was pretty bummed about.  For $8.99 i got my money's worth, but limited in terms of variety.  If i went back, ill probably order something from the menu."}
{"text":"We came here after leaving another place because we were disappointed.  Boy, did they make it much better for us!  We could smell the food in the air when we walked in.  Very inviting!  The salsa tasted fresh and flavorful.  The servers were very attentive and helpful.  The food was very good, they kept our drinks full, and we may have found a new go-to place for Mexican food in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has gotten any good reviews on here.  Food is bad, service is slow, and it is on the expensive side for Mexican food.  I always go to a restaurant three times before I will post a negative review on here because everyone has off days.  This place was the same experience  all three times.   I won't be going a fourth time...."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat. The steak nachos are pretty good, and plenty for 2+. I know the owner so he always treats me right. Recommend this place for the food and location. Bring a date for dinner and a movie."}
{"text":"I'm just not sure what to make of Las Fuentes.  My first visit for lunch was really great.  Attentive, prompt service, fresh, hot chips, and yummy entree.  I was excited to have this place so close to our  house.  Second visit, during dinner, was borderline terrible.  My daughter's grilled cheese was basically margarined-up bread with fake cheese slices that were nowhere near melted or even warm.  My husband's entree (a house special, according to our server) was bland, but my bean burrito was fine.  I feel like I could get this same food from one of the other Mexican places around here."}
{"text":"A very little known but great Mexican restaurant in Surprise. Easy to miss, it's tucked away next to the UltraStar threater.   Far better than any of the other local alternatives (Rio Mirage, Macayos). Food is great, salsa is incredible, and staff is very friendly. Great environment too. A must try, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Las Fuentes is our fav place to go to for Mexican food! We love it! Tonight I called in a order (first time) ordered Caldo de Res and a bean and cheese burrito. The young lady that answered the phone was professional and polite but got my order terribly wrong. When my son arrived home with the food, I don't know what kind of soup was in the container. It had meatballs with a tomato based sauce. There were no flour tortillas (she even asked me what kind of tortillas I wanted).  The soup was good but I had my taste buds set on the soup I ordered. Las Fuentes makes it delicious and my son enjoyed his burrito. This isn't going to keep me from ordering again or eating in with my family. Next time I hope to get the tasty Caldo de Res I order. Don't worry, this place is still my favorite for Mexican food and will continue to eat there!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to AZ from CA.  Looking for good mexican food and found it here.  Las Fuentes Mexican Grill is very good.  Salsa is great....Try the Pork Verde Enchiladas, and the Seafood Burrito.  You won't be disappointed.  Staff is friendly, efficient and prices are good too!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Excellent salsa and chips! Try the chile verde burrito, its huge!! Mini chimis and taco salad great as well."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly. The food was pretty good and I loved the ambiance. Great place!"}
{"text":"Been here before for the dinner buffet...It sucked....but the Sunday Brunch buffet with endless Mimosas is really outstanding and the only time I ever step foot in this place.  Give it a try on Sunday morning, you wont be disappointed.  Lunch or dinner, your better off someplace else."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch after catching Sully at Carmike.  We were greeted promptly and seated. Fresh chips and salsa were brought.  Their salsa is the best!!!!   Flavorful and chunky and just the right heat.  Ordered the nachos with chicken and the fajita steak salad/tostada.  OMG!!!!   They were awesome!!!!  The meats were flavorful and tender and plentiful.  I loved the grilled onions and peppers that came with the fajita were grilled to perfection and there were plenty of them.  Service was impeccable and top notch.  We definitely left completely full and satisfied.  I will absolutely be coming back and this is my new favorite mexican food restaurant.  Try it and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bill:54.68 Costs:  p.s., lousy check out time. I had to walk up, request to pay my bill, an additional 20 minutes wait time destroys other reviews to u!"}
{"text":"I don't get the great reviews. I have been here twice and will not return.  First time food was edible so we decided to try buffet for lunch.  First clue was the buffet was so small I could hardly believe they called it a buffet.  It had fajita chicken, cheese enchiladas, bbq ribs, rice, beans, and a warm green salad.  That was the whole buffet. None of the food was hot it was barely warm.  We brought it to their attention and they brought a thermometer out to show us the food was fine.  Then they offered to microwave it for us.  Really???  I obviously won't be returning."}
{"text":"Really good food and service. The Sunday buffet looked good, but I ordered from the menu. Great place during the week for a peaceful lunch. The singer who performs on Sundays is very loud, so ask for a table somewhere away from the sound system."}
{"text":"My mom was in town visiting and she loves mexican food so I wanted to bring her to something traditional and good near our house in Surprise. After checking the review on Yelp, I decided to give this place a try and was pleasantly rewarded for doing so. The decore was very welcoming and the food was delicious. They give such large portions you can easily have two meals! I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a low key but fantastic mexican restaurant on the west side!"}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic mexican food this is NOT the place.  First off...they could not bring me a salsa that was spicy to go with my chips.  My 8 yr thats hates anything remotely spicy was jus fine though and loved it.  I ordered a \"burrito asado\".  Im sorry, but if I pay 12 dollars for a carne asada burrito I expect way better.  20% meat, 70% beans, 10% cheese is a failure all around.  Nobody in my family of 4 finished their food.    The food is the problem!  The service was excellent and absolutely no complaints, very attentive, happy and upbeat!!   Negro Modelo on tap!!!  Awesome!  The beer and service is the only reason Im giving this 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good homemade mexican style food, nice inside, good decor."}
{"text":"We visit this restaurant on a regular. We have tried a huge variety of meals on the menu and have never been disappointed. The chips and salsa are excellent and the staff are always great. They have a mariachi performer on some nights who is incredible. They also have the best michelada in town. We usually use a coupon from the back of a Fry's receipt for a great discount."}
{"text":"Went there again last night and once again I wonder why I don't go there more often.  EXCELLENT customer service, fun happy hour, nice size margaritas.  Great buffet! With great Arizona weather, too bad no patio, but otherwise a good choice all around."}
{"text":"Great food and service!!! :) We will be coming back and telling people how good it is!"}
{"text":"Its decent, good service, good salsa n chips, food is 4 out of 5.  I thought it needed a little more flavor, but i do tend to have a pecular sense of taste."}
{"text":"I almost never go back to a restaurant if it disappoints me the first time.  This place will not get any more of my money.  There are just way too many better options for the price, even in Surprise.  It's a little more expensive than Macayo's and not even as good.  Then there are several small Mexican restaurants in the area that are much cheaper and way better."}
{"text":"I moved here after going to college and grad school in Texas, and also worked at a couple of chain Mexican restaurants when I was younger, so I've had my share of Mexican and Tex-Mex.  So far, in over half a decade living in the Valley, this is the best Mexican I've had.  What really stood out to me the first time we stopped by after a movie next door at the Digiplex was the freshness of the stuffed relleno peppers.  Literally everywhere else I've tried them, rellenos have been mushy, soggy, rubbery, floppy, gross messes.  Las Fuentes batters and fries theirs fresh to order, which I know because I asked how it was that they were insanely fresher than I've ever had.  The rest of their fare stacks up to the rellenos; everything is made fresh in-house to perfection, and although most of what they serve isn't overly fancy or unique, the reason we've gone back a few times and taken friends who visited from Texas is because everything they do is done right.  And as far as I'm concerned, there's not much more you can ask of a restaurant.  Oh, and the service has been great every time I was there too!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday. Didn't know ahead of time there was a brunch. The Server was pushing the brunch pretty hard and seemed put out that we wanted a menu.  Service was very slow in every aspect from bringing us some chips to preparing and serving our food. We don't like buffets and it seemed like they weren't prepared for folks wanting table service."}
{"text":"Our Grande Platter was expertly prepared this evening. ...this place has been our go to for the last year since moving to this neighborhood! We generally come during the day but ventured out for an evening meal tonight. Garrett, our server, was friendly professional and prompt.   There was a lady at the bar who began to sing loudly (apparently had been warned prior to our arrival)...the lady was using vulgar language and Garrett jumped in and immediately shut her down and told her it was time to go in a quiet and professional manner. I can tell you the young families and older guests VERY much appreciated that he followed thru and that he remained calm while she tried to goad him with that's of writing a bad review.  .  Been in his shoes and he handled her perfectly!  Thanks for assuring our evening was great Garrett!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. You can't beat the friendly service and the Sunday champagne brunch is phenomenal. It's great to always see the owner/manager working behind the bar and out on the restaurant floor greeting customers."}
{"text":"Wow, are these tacos GREAT!  We got the pork belly tacos, and these are, as they say, 'to die for.'  I've never had tacos so delicious.  It's really an 'OMG' moment.  These are an excellent value, either $4 or $5. I had two and along with a chicken taco (below) and the excellent and distinctive guacamole had me full.  I also had a crispy chicken taco, which I would say was 'good.'   Service was excellent.  I'm told that they don't do 'to go' orders because the chef is a perfectionist -- and the taste shows."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around the area!! Great service and amazing food. Clean and clean bathrooms as well. They have some of the best shredded beef tacos I've ever had. Everytime I've gone I get exceptional service an amazing food. I go every time I'm craving Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"I personally have problems with their food, my boyfriend does not & actually seems to like this place very much.  I enjoy the drinks though!  It's a good place to stop before you catch your movie next door."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time with my grandpa and dad food was excellent i ordered the carne asada probably was one of the best i ever had my grandpa and dad had combination plates they liked those as well fairly inexpensive meals most entrees 10-13$ good portions service was a little slow but on a friday night hard not to expect that will definitely return"}
{"text":"Customer service is fast, and it's decently priced for amazing good food! Chips and salsa changed a couple times but the current salsa and chips we had the other night was so good that the server brought us out a huge bowl of it ..... and there's a sampler with nachos(beans included), Taquito's, quesadillas and mini chimis .... it fed three of us (one being a man who eats everything) and we still went home with a whole box full of food leftover!!! And our bill was only $13! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Good fresh food. Refried beans were excellently prepared you could see the beans in it. Had the chicken flautas and they were awesome. They had a good size kids meal and cups. My hubby had the tacos. Extremely satisfied with our delicious meal. The atmosphere in this location is great, Mexican music in the background and the decor excellent. Can't wait to come back and see how consistent the experience is."}
{"text":"This place is very unassuming from the outside but when you go in it is very colorful and rustic in a Mexican decor. The servers were very nice and brought out our drinks right away along with some chips and salsa. We decided to order some drinks and appetizers. The foos looked good but the taste seemed a little off. There was an after taste to the foods that were fried and the chicken in the quesadilla tasted old. Las Fuentes is an ok Mexican food joint but in a state that has a Mexican food restraunt at every corner they have to step up their food game to be a standout."}
{"text":"Water- warm, barely any ice Salad-iceberg lettuce warm, cheese warm and chunky. Came out with meal. Salsa-watery  Shredded chicken taco- 1 tablespoon chicken, 3 tablespoons warm iceberg lettuce. Nachos- chips burnt, chicken flavorless and all dark meat, came out with meal. And  Hostess- in back chatting and laughing with wait staff as we waited. Waiter-clearly hates his job, checked on us twice because I called him over both times for water."}
{"text":"It was OK I guess. Nothing that special. Not better than most average Mexican places. The chips were all crushed up crumbs. We were 2 couples, paying separate, each with the a Groupon. Usually that's cool with most places but they didn't allow it. The margarita was good but didn't taste like it had much tequila in it. My enchilada were pretty good, but 2 people in our party didn't care for theirs - hardly any chicken, mostly beans. Rather cheap taste. Service was decent. Nothing really great that would get me back in the door again."}
{"text":"I don't know why more people don't come here?! I think it's not well known, but needs to be! It's pretty good Mexican food considering there are so many around. The salsa, shredded chicken, and service are great!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and a great bar... What more could ya ask for. Sunday champagne brunch is a must..."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for a while now and it's always very good. It's not over the top crazy good but it's solid food and they obviously care about taking care of customers. Margaritas are tasty and all the servers are top notch! If you are looking for very decent food and good prices this place is a good choice."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by my new friends Kurt and Val. Gotta say. Not bad!  Tacos and chips and salsa. Deliciosa!"}
{"text":"Do not get a salad. I had the Mexican Caesar and I was sick right after eating it. The dressing was so gross, it tasted like mayonnaise. The cucumbers were warm. The chips were so greasy and the salsa wasn't anything to brag about."}
{"text":"Was here on 7/8/14 and 3 of us ended up with food poisoning. Margarita was weak and food pretty bland. The service was kind of slow. If I could give this a zero star I would. I'd prefer to eat at Aqui cal-mex back in Cailfornia. At least their food was amazing, organic, and the best industrial strength margaritas around. The margaritas are so strong they suggest only 2 but will cut you off at 3."}
{"text":"If you need to relax after work and craving for margarita. This is the place! The bar is small and cute and the restaurant has a homey feeling. The service is friendly. They offer complimentary chips and salsa.  Las Fuentes offers different flavors of margarita! I tried the mango flavored margarita and I am hooked! The prices of the drinks are okay and they do offer discounted drinks during happy hour."}
{"text":"Good food, decent prices and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"What a great find!   This Mexican restaurant is located next to the Ultrastar Movie Theatre at Wadell and Litchfield Road in Surprise.   From the outside, you can't tell that it is a really nice, roomy, restaurant on the inside.  It is a sit down Mexican restaurant with all you can eat chips and salsa.  (Before we went there the first time, I thought it was just a small fast-food place, but I was wrong - it is a big, full-service restaurant.)  They have very reasonable prices, great food and a great atmosphere.  How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place out.  From the outside it looks like nothing special but after walking through the doors we were surprised to see the amount of great work they put in the decor.  The place was packed.  We had about a 15 minute wait.  That's good!  Means the people who were there liked eating there.  I base all of my mexican restaurants on the quality of the carne asada.  It was good, not the best, but ranked highly.  My wife got the chicken quesadilla which was also very good.  Both meals were huge and we had left overs to enjoy at a later time.  The waitress was very nice, there's a full bar, portions huge, and a good crowd.  They're even planning on building a patio to expand the restaurant: Business is good!  They also have a Sunday all-you-can-eat champagne brunch that I'm really excited to try.  The waitress said that it's really good."}
{"text":"Lunch time buffet-taco bar  Music WAY TOO LOUD for lunch hour-and TV's at the top volume -Mexican football  No one greeted us, yet the sign at the podium says wait to be seated. It was 11:30 am. We waited, but then I walked to the kitchen to get someone's attention.  We had to ask for the music to be turned down-it was so loud it was really unpleasant to listen to. It's not like it was a dance floor/bar scene. It's lunch. Food.  We had to wait for our drinks, though there were about 5 people in the place.  And.....we had to wait, and wait for the ticket. Finally, we just left cash on the table so we didn't have to wait for change.   Lunch should be eat and go-not wait, wait, wait, ......"}
{"text":"This is my third time here the customer service is always extremely polite and professional the food has always been exceptionally fresh I love seafood and very tasty I was born and raised in Mexico and I can tell you that this Mexican food is awesome"}
{"text":"Gave this place a second chance & I was right the first time!  Although the customer service was OK the food was terrible. The food tasted microwavable as if it was something quick to serve. It was very tasteless, had to add salt pepper & lime for a hint of flavor for the meal was very much lacking it. The beer was over priced at six dollars a bottle and this was during happy hour! It was nice to know that this restaurant was clean but did I have to smell the overpowering Fabuloso cleaning solution while eating!? That smell concluded our time spent at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is just okay. Service not great, Won't be back frequently. Seems to be going downhill, wouldn't be surprised to see this place closed within next 6 months."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happenedto this place. Over the last 2 months they have not been as good as my previous experiences. The food is definitely not as good. The service is still above average, but the food has definitely taken a hit. I would classify them as a Filibertos with a wait staff... There are a couple of really good choices in Surprise for Mexican food. I'll be crossing this one off that list."}
{"text":"We went to this place a couple of weeks ago.  It was nothing impressive.  Average Mexican food.  It clearly states on the menu if you request chips and salsa for a third time there will be a charge....seriously???  My honey can finish 2 baskets of chips by himself just waiting for the food to arrive, so no we will not be going back.  We were in and out."}
{"text":"While I find the prices to be a tad on the high side for a place that's pretty divey, I will say that having a Mexican buffet is pretty unique to the area and well worth the price at $9.99. I did appreciate that they didn't charge me for my 2 year old to eat from the buffet but I didn't appreciate the lack of free refills. It doesn't say anything on the menu about not having free refills and our server didn't mention it.  The service is pleasant and friendly though, the restaurant is C-L-E-A-N, and the food is served hot and fresh. I guess I can suck it up on the lack of free refills or just order water in order to enjoy solid food with very nice service."}
{"text":"5 stars for food. Shrimp enchilada was great!  Service was tab slow due to short handed & dinner rush. Would without a doubt eat here again. By far best Mexican restaurant in the west valley."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my steak burrito and ice tea.  A lot of restaurants can get the burrito right but not necessarily the ice tea.  This was good ice tea. I had about 6 glasses while watching Wimbledon at the bar.  Friendly staff and good service."}
{"text":"This is an excellent authentic Mexican restaurant.  New location recently opened in Surprise, Arizona.  Service was fantastic and food was delicious."}
{"text":"Their chicken fajitas for two would be my last meal! Also they make a great long island ice tea."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was so-so.  I always order the same thing when I hit a new Mexican Food restaurant.  Chicken taco with rice and beans.  I figure that its easy, but easy to mess up.  If they get that right, its worth a repeat visit.  The only good thing about the tacos was that the veggies were fresh and the taco shell wasn't store bought.   The \"shredded chicken\" actually resembled chicken mush.  It was wet, which made the taco fall apart and the chicken itself had no flavor whatsoever.  The beans and rice were ok.   I will come back and try something else, just nothing with chicken."}
{"text":"I had a 5 stars for this place until stupid Gary waiter showed up. Then changed to 1. At this point I am changing my review just because I like service food and promptness! Roberto, Jose, they all good here ! Food is delishhhhh!!!"}
{"text":"this use to be our spot for brunch every sunday and today after waiting for almost an hour the host decides to seat to other groups before and jump us. than she wanted to sit Me and My group of 4 cramped up in a small table. Never will I go back to this place or recommended to My friends and Family."}
{"text":"Well this was surprising. It seems like a pretty nice restaurant, and most of it probably is. But what I ordered, pollo mole was terrible. The mole sauce was good, but they served me a chicken back! For $14?! There was hardly any meat, I struggled to cut it, and I finally figured out it was a chicken back with the tail still on! I complained, and they took it off the bill. Didn't have an appetite to order something else."}
{"text":"So we went to Las Fuentes last night in part because of the new management.  I had the chimi Grande and it was terrible.  Not that it tasted bad; that was the problem.  The chimi was absolutely tasteless. It was supposed to be deep fried to make it crispy--- it was deep fried but certainly not crispy.  The refried beans were bland with a weird texture.  I was really disappointed in the food. The service was slow but not terrible."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food! this was some pretty good Mexican food! The guacamole was kinda turning brown by the time I got home I'm only 4 minutes away so maybe it was sitting out for a little while but it was still good guacamole turns brown fast if it's the real deal. I did not have any complaints. I will definitely eat here again. I have no idea why it's so empty my husband said the place was dead  I like empty spots so if your looking for something low key go for it!   My 3rd time going back it is soooo good"}
{"text":"Great vibe, great food , great service, love the buffet on tues and sunday,awesome price!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow talk about outstanding food and service. This place knows how to top both. My Family and I ate here Wednesday We had such great service \"Carlos M\" it being our first time eatting  there he was very helpfull on answering our qwestions and offering sudjustions. He was always right there filling our drinks checking on how everything was."}
{"text":"The margarita has zero tequila in it. The server didn't know anything to recommend on the menu. The service was also slow and nonexistent. The chimichanga was bland and the beans tasted like it was from a can without cheese. When we informed the server they barely cared to help. Then asked for a manager to talked to and they sent over a different waiter who rudely asked what's wrong and said they'd take a part off the bill. Server never returned to the table with the bill and third server messed up payment. Food isn't homemade or fresh, taste like a can and is gross. Will never return!!"}
{"text":"Service was very fast not too crazy busy so we wen didn't have to wait long for a table. Had the ceviche tostadas. They were big full of flavor and shrimp. 5.99 per tostada but two will fill you up for sure. They had a Buffett that look good the only thing is the desserts for the Buffett looked like they stopped at frys to get a cake."}
{"text":"I ordered the Carne Asada for dinner a couple weeks ago which had a huge piece of Carne Asada cooked medium rare, a fresh grilled jalapeño, and fresh accompaniments. It was the best I have had to date so for lunch today I decided to order it again. However, when the plate arrived at the table the Carne Asada was cooked to the point of jerky, I couldn't even cut it with a steak knife. The jalapeños were from sliced that were pickled, and the accompaniments were small. It seemed that for the same price the quality of the meal was sadly misrepresented. I may try it one more time but not for a long time."}
{"text":"I would never go here again. They have really poor service and the GM doesn't believe in any customer service. The food is often cold, not cooked right. They have had major issues with sewer backup and refuse to do anything about it. Wouldn't be surprised if you get sick from the food here. Management is 100% clueless about service or handling customers."}
{"text":"When we moved to Surprise four years ago, La Fuentes was the first restaurant we ate at. We really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Since then, we have came back many times. Sadly to say, their food have gotten worse as the time has passed. To the pont that we no longer come here. How ever, the only food I really enjoy here is there BBQ Ribs! Thats right RIBS! They have their all you can eat buffet, and BBQ Ribs is one of their choices. It's cheap, not the best of meat, but hey! All you can eat, and has enough BBQ sauce splattered on to cover all the defects. Good enough for me. Because of this, and only this, It raised their review from a two star to a three star!  We do come by once in awhile when we're at the movies. But this is no longer our favorite."}
{"text":"Great food great service you can't find a better place on the price! Sunday Brunch only $14.95 for all you can eat plus they also have Champagne and Mimosa"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here last night and I've had to poop like 6 times today.... So needless to say I would not recommend this place. Not only that but the food was just okay. Salsa was delicious and definitely made fresh but everything else was just meh."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Arrived noon Sat -- not busy and took 6 minutes for anyone to seat us. Beef Taco had very large chunks of cold beef. Cheese in cheese  enchilada was not melted and cold. Salsa below par.  Anyone loving this place is either a shill or does not know what good Mexican food really tastes like."}
{"text":"Food OK.  Some items were not hot.  Service good.  Wouldn't go out of my way to dine here in the future but would return to try again."}
{"text":"GREAT Mexican food!! The decor in the place is adorable.  Complete with faux rooftops and balconies, you feel as if you are outside in the streets of a charming Mexican village.  The people there are super nice and attentive.  We love the salsa and always get the burrito asado with shredded beef.  The portions are large and the meat is always trimmed and seasoned well.  We usually do dinner here and then go to a movie at Ultra Star which is an awesome theater!"}
{"text":"Service was really good but that's about it. Tamale appeared either bought out or just old, very dry and little flavor, the meat inside was grey. Chile relleno was very tough and the batter wasn't very good at all. Cheese dip was just velveeta with some green chilli cut up in it. My oldest son who eats pretty much anything said his tacos weren't good and barely touched them, my younger son devoured the chicken nuggets but they looked just like Tyson out of a bag I have at home. My wife said her chimichanga was good so maybe it's just me but for Arizona you can do way better for Mexican food. Way to expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"Great service and top line Mexican food.  I first experienced their food at the \"Taste of Surprise\" event hosted by the Rotary Club of Surprise held at the Riverboat Bingo Hall last March.  The samples were so good, I thought I would check them out for dinner.  For a Wednesday night, the place was packed.  That's always a good sign.  I ordered the beef Chimi and it was big, juicy and full of flavor.   The waiter was very attentive and quick with chips/salsa and cold beers.  Overall, a great place, at a great price for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out by ordering one of my favorites - tortilla soup. It was tasty enough, but far different from any tortilla soup I've been served. In fact, the base consisted mostly of carrots and potatoes, which I've never seen in tortilla soup. It seemed as though the albondigas soup and tortilla soup are interchangeable here; just add pork meatballs for one and tortilla strips and chicken for the other. Also, there were no avocado slices in this. As the service was much better than average, I will withhold harsher judgement until I try it another time. Maybe I'll try their chile rellenos."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner. Hector was our server. He was very attentive and got our orders correct! Our food came out quickly and was delicious! Thanks for the great dinner and great service."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great Zesquiel was ready to explain the menu and he did.  We had Fajitas for two,  It was so good and plenty of food. Would recommend this restaurant, food is great."}
{"text":"In the last two years, we have become \"regulars\". It's ideal for lunch and a movie, or dropping in for a satisfying meal that won't break the pocketbook because we don't want to cook at home. The chili rellenos are fluffy, the enchiladas are to die for. They have an excellent, hotter, red sauce you can request. The combination dinner for two is huge and offers some variety.   If you only order off the menu, you may not realize the full variety and excellence of what comes out of this kitchen. The Sunday buffet is vast and delicious..it feels like a party. Our favorite meal, bar none, in all of Surprise. We often stop by for the smaller Tuesday or Thursday noon buffet. Where else can you get all you can eat soup to desert for two for under $20?  Love soup, love the custard flan. The wait staff is generally kind and efficient...the boys especially. This is a real Mexican restaurant, often not toned down for American tastes. yum!"}
{"text":"Love the environment and feel of the place! Our waiter was so attentive and friendly and the food was really good! I love any place that has vegetarian burritos! They are my fave!"}
{"text":"This is another go to place. It's not bad and will do when in a rush. The service has always been decent and so has the food. I recommend the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"First time here , we are from Los Angles and was told this place great. It was ok not great . We had to ask for tortilla .my husband had the fish soup and he really liked it . I'll give this place a second chance ."}
{"text":"Last night we had a craving for mexican food and we remembered seeing a coupon in the Savvy Shopper for Las Fuentes which recently opened in surprise.  The coupon we had was for buy one entree get on free of equal or lesser value up to 8.99.  being that we just had our yard landscaped a free entree was very enticing.  We arrived to find a well decorated mexican restaurant, we started looking over the menu and after a few minutes we started to think the joke was that nothing on the menu costs less than 8.99 except salads.  luckily my wife was able to find a tostada for 8.50, I ordered the fountain sampler which was their appetizer sampler platter.  We got our food shortly after.  Both plates were huge, I had a mountain of nachos, several quesadillas, taquitos, and mini-chimichanga's.  the nachos were very cheesy and tasty and I really enjoyed the mini-chimi's.  I probably only ate half the plate and had plenty of leftovers.  Overall the food was very good.  the coupon was a bit offsetting though when the average menu price was 14.99.  I'd like to come back when we're less broke and order some of the more specialized entrees."}
{"text":"I Have been all over trying different restaurants in Phoenix but mostly here in Surprise. My wife and I like all kinds of food, but our favorite is Mexican. There are lots of Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, some are OK others good but not GREAT LIKE  Las Fuentes Mexican Grill, The food is Outstanding and the people who work there don't act like it's just a job, They are nice, happy, professional making sure you are getting the very best serves and food. My wife and I are retired so we have been different days of the week, and breakfast lunch and dinner.  LAS FUENTES MEXICAN GRILL IS THE VERY BEST IN SURPRISE & PHOENIX."}
{"text":"Showed up on Sunday at 11 am and enjoyed an awesome buffet.  There were traditional Mexican dishes like enchiladas and tacos, as well as an omelet and dessert bar.  This made my day.  I will be back."}
{"text":"First time here, purchased a groupon and decided to try it. Food was decent but the bartender George was amazing!!! Will definitely be back!! It's hard to find great service and there are hundreds of restaurants to choose from, service is where it's at!! I'll remember the service before I remember the food BUT I hear that their Sunday brunch is awesome so we'll be sure to try that!!"}
{"text":"Great chips! Pure and simple FRESH salsa. Salsa flavor explodeds in your mouth....great start to the meal.   I ordered a Cadillac Margarita. Their version is supposed have Patron Citronge. The drink was made in front of me and the Patron wasn't used...the bartender made it wrong! I don't think the correct recipe would have mattered as the proportions were wrong and the margarita mix was awful. I ordered a premium Long island Iced Tea next. The bartender didn't understand cocktails are about proper proportions. He seemed to think more booze made a better drink...it doesn't. Cocktails should be smooth and well balanced...his were not.  I ordered 2 shredded beef tacos with rice and beans. The bean were good. They had good flavor and good consistency. The rice tasted instant. The rice was good....just poor quality. The tacos had VERY LITTLE beef. Tacos have little beef to begin with. When you skimp on the meat, it's noticeable.   I will not go back to this restaurant. Surprise has better Mexican restaurants with better bartenders."}
{"text":"Great Sunday buffet! Mimosas and yummy Mexican food is a great combo! Went with the family on a sunday AM, and ate until I was sure dinner was out of the question."}
{"text":"Just got done having a nice dinner with friends. Great food and great service. Had the verde burrito. Great atmosphere and people.Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food restaurant, definitely better than Macayo's or Garcia's!  It's next to the movie theater, nice big parking lot, & it's much larger inside than it looks from the outside. Good atmosphere, nicely decorated, comfortable seating, very polite staff. Our waiter was very attentive, but did not hover. We went early, around 4 pm & didn't have to wait to be seated.   Food was good. My friend & I had the Fajitas for 2: chicken, steak & shrimp. They should rename it to Fajitas for 4, possibly 6 OR Fajitas for 2 hungry guys, lol. The house cabernet wine wasn't bad at all, so we each had 2 glasses :D   Walked by later that night on my way out of the theater & I swear I saw disco lights in there, lol. Maybe later at night the bar turns into a mini disco?"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the Valley. It's locally owned with great service and food."}
{"text":"Awesome place to come. Always great service. Steve is an awesome bartender and always knows what we want. 10+ stars!"}
{"text":"Stick to the chips and salsa ! You've been warned, worst enchilada & tamale Ive ever had, the chimichanga was half cooked and ground beef has a terrible taste, sometimes there's a reason restaurants give away food a half price on groupon, it wasn't even worth 1/2 price. Service was great !"}
{"text":"We ordered take out and it was a little pricey but the portions were large. They got the order perfect! Guacamole was fresh and yummy and chips and salsa were great. We will order again :)"}
{"text":"I have reviewed this before and am doing it again!  The Sunday Brunch Buffet is just plain one of my favorite things ever!  Great selection, fantastic music, bottomless Mimosas, and they don't hold back :).  Every time i am in the area i make it a point to stop here and that will NOT change, only wish i was around more often.  Love the staff, the singing, the food!"}
{"text":"Not bad. The food is pretty good, but don't eat here if you are in a rush. We did go on a Sunday night so service might have been slower. I got the fajitas, which were good. And my partner tried a combination platter. He enjoys cheese a lot so it was quite good for him. Not sure if we will be back or not."}
{"text":"It's always a good sign when you want to eat at the same place twice in one week.   Excited for a new Mexican restaurant in Surprise, my husband and I tried Las Fuentes twice this past week. The first time we were lured in with a coupon and I tried the Tostada Grande. It was more like a taco salad lax on the lettuce. It had a fried flour tortilla, a layer of beans, shredded beef, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream. It was indeed \"grande\" and hit the spot. Fast forward a few nights later and I sent the hubby out to get something to bring back for dinner. We decided to try their \"Grande platter for two\" and we were not disappointed. Once again the servings were large and the food was tasty. We were particularly impressed with the enchiladas and the chicken tostada.   The salsa tastes very similar to Macayos, but other than that the food definitely has a little bit more love put into it that some of the other choices around town."}
{"text":"Saw the ratings and had family in from out of town  wanted some Mexican food.  We did carryout and while ordering I asked 3 times...plain chicken tacos.  Three times!   Well....they didn't come plain and there was so little meat it was pathetic.  It was 2 inches of lettuce with a small layer of meet.   The carne asada was over cooked and full of fat.  The best part of the entire meal was the churros."}
{"text":"We stopped in for the Sunday buffet brunch and it was great! The shredded beef was my favorite along with the amazing omelet  station. I was happy to see that we have a great buffet for brunches in the west valley. It was not super busy either. My daughter enjoyed all the fresh fruit and my husband thought the enchiladas were great. The music began as we were leaving so we did not get to take part in that. I really enjoyed everything about the food especially the freshness!"}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks. Wait staff somewhat attentive but needed to be called to attention a couple of times."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I've either walked or drove by this location thinking it was more of a fast food type. This restaurant is in a strip mall type building connected to the movie theater. I'm so glad I stopped in today to finally check it out! When I walked in I was surprised how big it is inside. Very nice inside and full service restaurant. We were seated right away and our drink order taken. We ordered the toquitos as an appetizer. They were amazing and came with a side of guacamole, jalapeño, sour cream, and hot sauce. Perfect. Our waiter was happy, helpful and funny. The menu has so many selections of things I never even knew were a thing, and I love my Mexican food. I went with the waiters favorite and ordered the seafood platter with a seafood taco, shrimp enchilada, and rice and beans. FABULOUS! To die for. My husband ordered steak fajitas and they not only looked amazing and smelled amazing he said they were the best he's had around the Phoenix area. Can't wait to tell my friends and come back again to try something new. Do t let the initial look of the building fool you. You're definitely missing out if you do!"}
{"text":"I had Las Fuentes only once, but it was one of the best Mexican restaurants in Surprise. I noticed it was closed and renamed. I hope the food at the new restaurant is just as delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place, although the dishes are not consistent, they are always great! staff is friendly and Service is Great!"}
{"text":"Under new ownership!  Reading that I decided to go again and check the place out again. Recently purchased by YAYA's TACOS.My entire point of going on was the preview to check out of four catering a Christmas party. I grabbed a friend and my daughter and at went on a Tues.   Shredded Beef Taco - this is my standard test for any Mexican food place, sadly... There are some drive thrus that serve a better one    Chips & salsa - salsa was OK... I saw the was a charge after 2 bowls.. That was a non issue for our party.   Carnitas - Amazing!!!  Juicy and will flavored! They were fantastic  served with the teaspoon of Guacamole!!! There was about another teaspoon of sour cream...  Wow... Don't over do it... The beans were great, we all agreed!  My daughter had a combo, chicken enchilada, cheese enchilada and tamale. (She was bummed there was no corn tamale) She offered me a bite and I tried the cheese, unimpressive. She offered me a bite of the chicken \"Is it any better\" \"Eh...\" I declined.   I declined to try the chimi.  Back to the fact that I was there to check for possibly getting catering, I asked for a menu. (I looked at it in the truck... It was a To Go Menu!   Really wanting to give the local round the corner new buisness a true shot.. We went back today since the  Carnitas were so good. My Dad had them and liked them, the Carne Asada was nothing spectacular. Strangely,  the band are different. Just one day later... We just didn't care for them today. Again I asked for a catering menu and was told that is a To Go Menu   Good Luck in your venture!  (I didn't even take a picture...)"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty Food!!! The chips and salsa were fresh!! The trio fajita was delicious!! The cheesecake with whipped tasteful as well!! OMG The Churros tasted fresher and were very amazing!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, margaritas, atmosphere, and service. Cute place. We will be taking friends there"}
{"text":"Tried out their Champagne Brunch on Sunday and it was a treat! From menudo, posole, enchiladas, pan dulce and a lot of other choices! I'm usually pretty nervous when I hear Mexican buffet but after trying pretty much everything at Las Fuentes not only was I stuffed but wanted to wait around a while just so I could have more. Service was excellent and judging by the crowd this new place won't have any problems staying busy."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch, about a half full dinning room. Food was good and service was nice. Decor was a little nicer than I was expecting for it being in a shopping center. Nicely priced Lunch Specials. I got a Tamale and Chili Relleno for $8 and my wife had a Surpreme Burrito (fried) for $8."}
{"text":"We had the best time. Our waiter was kind and attentive. The food was delicious. My mom and I enjoyed the champagne brunch. My husband had fish tacos. Our ten-year-old daughter had a cheese quesadilla. Our seven-year-old daughter ate a bean-and- cheese burrito. We all had sweet treats after. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Easter \"Champagne\" brunch. My wife and I don't drink Alcohol, but I saw that mimosas were being freshly poured and I thought, well, We'll just have the OJ. The server said that we cannot just provide OJ, but only in combination with champagne, but you can buy a glass of OJ. My wife is pregnant and for over $13 for a buffet which includes Champagne or mimosas, but not just OJ is absurd. I asked for the manager and they would not show their face to me. Food aspect was average with the omelette station being the clear shining star here, it was the one bright spot on a sour meal experience. Mexican food sitting under a heat lamp for significant periods of time never bodes well for flavor, but it's was OK. Frustrated with the whole OJ experience, lacking manager back bone, and average to slightly below average food quality...we will not be back."}
{"text":"Just moved to Surprise and we were looking for a good Mexican food place. This was exactly what we needed. GREAT chips and salsa and amazing food. Good pricing for the amount of food. We got a bean and cheese burrito and a burrito supremo and both enjoyed our lunch. The service was phenomenal- server was Ezequiel, THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Took the family my wife had the combo with a cheese enchilada and a cheese tamal.  The red sauce is nothing but pure chili powder watered down.. Terrible.   I had the Carnitas Uruapan. Should have asked for a plate of pork jerky because that is what it was..    My son was the only smart one that did not order anything.      I have had my share of \"Authentic\" Mexican food and this is not even close to authentic.      To top off the night I ordered two of the $3.00 draft beers and was charged $7.98.."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for brunch for years. It's $14.99 per person which includes the buffet and unlimited champagne or mimosas. When I say unlimited I mean UNLIMITED.  There is never a chance for your glass to be half full because the lovely staff is pouring more into your glass every second. The food is so so but it's a fun time. There is also this lovely woman who performs every Sunday. She's awesome!!   Give this place a chance. If you don't come for the food... at least come for the drinks!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and I was only slightly disappointed once. We ate here last night. I had the shrimp fajitas and they were excellent. My husband had tacos but thought they could use more flavor.   The live band was OK but too loud. They turned down the amp after we mentioned it. The Cadillac margarita es MUY EXCELLENTE!"}
{"text":"Wow what a find! This palce rocks we spilt the fatijs and it waas really good. The kids ordered chese and bean burritos, which were good, and served on chilled plates. The wait staff was very friendly and the decor was cool. We had some coupons so the meal came out to like 35 bucks. I will return to this place when I return to Surprise."}
{"text":"Place looked busy and smelled delightful. After a 30 min wait before being seated. We all decided to get the buffet. Lots of tasty looking dishes and with free mimosas. Everything tasted much as it looked. The carnitas and handmade corn tortillas stole the show.  They had run out of oj so mimosas turned to just champagne, and the bloody mary tasted like there was nit a drop of vodka to be found. Would of loved to have tasted the chips and salsa but after asking 3 times for them we gave up.  Overall food was tasty, service was slow."}
{"text":"I've eaten here atleast once a month and let me just say, I didn't get this fat by not knowing good Mexican food.  The prices are a bit high but the quality's always matched it. Growing up 45 minutes north of Mexico; I can honestly say this is as authentic as you'll find in the area.  I only gave it four stars because I don't like cinnamon in my enchilada sauce and sometimes theirs is a little to much."}
{"text":"Took the family in despite the mixed reviews. First off, my service was excellent from beginning to end. I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant experience.  Everyone really liked there food (and I've been to nearly every Mexican spot in phx). I ordered the camarones a la Diabla and also added chicken, they made it even though it wasn't an actual option. It was literally perfect,  and very spicy. My wife just had rolled tacos and was satisfied with her meal. Kids didn't complain so that's always a win. Only negatives would be the water and the salsa could be better and the $3 Margarita was really syrupy, but it was only $3.. All in all a very good experience and a great dish. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Since moving to Surprise from L.A.  I've been searching for a Mexican restaurant that has great food,  great service, great prices, and a clean establishment. Well guess what , I found it!!!"}
{"text":"Expecting something really good by the reviews.  The server was very upbeat and friendly.  Looking forward to a really good meal, however it did not turn out well. I sure wish that I could get my money back. :( Still searching for a great mexicn restaurant in the Surprise area."}
{"text":"I recently ate at Las Fuentes for the first time.  I'm not really a connoisseur of Mexican food because I don't eat it that often but I did think it was pretty tasty.  The portions are enormous - I highly recommend sharing a plate with whoever you're with.  The restaurant was nice and clean and the service was great!  Overall I give it four stars. Although it was good, it was a little pricey for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today and tried the cheese enchiladas. The red sauce covering the enchiladas was one of the most foul tasting things I have ever had. It somehow tasted overlooked and expired at the same time. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My family came in while waiting for our time at uptown alley next door.  The food, drinks, and service were top notch! I had a margarita and the chili verde burrito and both were absolutely amazing. Hubby liked his meal as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Steve, which is the manager now (congratulations ) always waits on us. The food I can say can be a hit or miss. The chicken fajitas are delicious but way too many onions. The tamales would be awesome if the sauce wasn't so strong and serve them piping hot. Get rid of those appetizer flautas. I swear they had a resemblance of cat food for filling. Yes, I had a cheeseburger. It would have been one of the best I ever had but the patty was awful. I think it was a frozen, pressed,rubbery,dry version. We will be back to see you Steve soon. But consider these setbacks. I really would love to give you 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We have heard good thing about this place. So my wife and I decided to give it a try. Walking up to the restaurant was strange. It was really dark walking up from the parking lot. We stepped in to the entrance. The first thing you notice is the Halloween decoration of a cob web directly over your head. I'm not a super tall guy (6ft) it was about an inch over my head. We then stood there for about 10 minutes staring at an empty hostess stand. Once a person took back into a very empty restaurant. We were immediately were brought chips a  \"salsa\". It's more like tomato water than salsa. I ordered the combo platter with a taco, an enchilada, a tamale, rice and beans. It was a ton of food. The enchilada and tamale was drenched some kind of thick salty red sauce. The taco had no flavor. My wife ordered the chicken sopa. It had no flavor what so ever. Between waiting a long time to order to waiting a long time for tasteless food it's so not worth it. I don't think we will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"What a damn shame. We've been living in Surprise for over 5 years and we just visited Las Fuentes for dinner tonight for our first time. I happy to say, adios Macayos, you are officially done. BTW, we have eaten at Las Fuentes for their Sunday brunch, F in good. Surprise is lacking in the Mexican food for dining however Las Fuentes answers that."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for brunch!!  We had the brunch buffet (with bottomless mimosas!!!) for only $14.99. Best deal ever! We didn't eat thattt much but we got our money's worth with the mimosas. Servers were friendly and definitely didn't hold back on the champagne! We're here for a few weeks for baseball, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was blah and not on my must eat here lists.  If you want Mexican food I am sure you can go somewhere else, like del taco to get the same result, taco bell is across the street as well."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the food and service is great. The chile verde is really tasty. Karina is a bomb waitress. Very nice and helpful  Unfortunately the atmosphere left something to be desired. They had a live band tonight and it was loud. Their fans might have been more annoying then them. They kept peeking on the PA and we could barely talk over dinner. I understand this is also a bar but the music should start later if your going to have it.   5 stars for food and service. 1 star for super annoying band  ------------------------------------ 3 stars."}
{"text":"Las Fuentes is excellent as their fresh food is prepared authentically. The service is great, too. They have a breakfast buffet early mornings on the weekends. My favorites here are the sopes with chorizo, the fish tacos and their bean dip appetizer. The bean dip has chorizo in it."}
{"text":"Wow not great.  Was surprised because of so many positive reviews.  I would put this place \"on par\" with Macayos but no better...and that is not saying much.    On the positive side the service was excellent.  The atmosphere was fine, pretty much like any other mexican place.  The food in my opinion was not what I expcted given all the good reviews here.  Chips were ok but the salsa was very watery and their \"hot sauce\" is more of a chipotle type thing than a red hot sauce.  I had enchiladas trio and it was well below average.  The beef one was ok, the cheese one was also ok, but the chicken one was barely even cooked.  Rice was seriously overcooked as well.    Pretty much exhausted all the possibilities of mexican restaurants in Surprise.  They are all below standard...probably will head to Arrowhead area when we have cravings for this type of food in the future."}
{"text":"Fabulous authentic flavor tucked away in a corner near Uptown Alley. If you are like me, you are most likely tired of looking for the best place to have a good Mexican meal. The flavors, the atmosphere and the owner make this a fun place to go with friends, family, business groups or just you. The wait staff is always friendly, the service can be a little slow especially on nights of new movie premiere's. We love to go for a late lunch or dinner after the dinner rush, which is usually about 7pm. The bar is always full of people, the buffet is always available. It's just a good place to go if you want fabulous food. They do not use lard in their beans, which makes it more fun to eat them and not worry about the waistline. Can't wait to go back! Their Burrito Supremo with chicken is amazing."}
{"text":"Came here to kill time before our movie. I didn't get a chance to try a margarita, but the service and food were  exceptional. Will be back and soon.  My wife had a burrito and I had a make your own combo. The salsa with the chips was chunky and just the right amount of spice for mild. The amount of food for the price seemed just right and was a good value."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been to this great restaurant now twice. There are a few reasons why we really like it. First, the food is good. Try the shrimp Ceviche-divine! I crave it! The Grande Platter for two was more than enough yummy food for the two of us. And the best part of this place...Sunday, after church, around 11am, they have 2 Mexican singers-one of which is 82 yo!! His voice and his ability to play guitar are fabulous. Not gonna lie, I cry each time I hear him cause he is so sweet to listen to!! Head out to a nice dining experience at Las Fuentes!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Thursday night. The place is small but cozy. There were a few other tables in there as well. We just had drinks and an appetizer. The mini chimis were amazing and the margaritas are good but a little sweet. We live so close and have never been here. Glad we did. Our server was great. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Las Fuentes has the best Mexican food in Surprise! Very nice staff as well. We eat here at least once a month and we are never disappointed. Portions are huge! The prices are so reasonable and the food is delicious! My favorites are their shrimp Caesar salad, shrimp al mojo de ajo, any burrito and we always enjoy their buffet as well."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review, but here goes: I have visited this place several times over the past 2 years, the reason for the 3 stars is that the quality of the food is not consistent. I have had the best ceviche here, and the worst! The fish tacos are really good and so were the chicken nachos. I started ordering ala carte because I do not like smashed re-fried beans; I prefer whole black beans. I asked the waiter if they had black beans, and he said no, that most people don't like them! Anyway, i don't like to have food on my plate that i know i wont eat, so ala carte it is!! I do find the regular red salsa is good, but not hot enough for my buds, so i asked if they had hotter, the waiter brought me another dish and it tasted like smoked chipotles from a can put through a blender, and not spicy at all; actually was no hotter than the regular red salsa just a different flavor, but it was good on the nachos. Because my spouse really likes the burritos, we will continue to come here...."}
{"text":"This place had good food but it's so small and feels very dark in there. Our first bowl of chips seemed stale but the second was good. The prices are high for what you get but the food was really good. Not sure I would race back to eat there again but we will see. The service was great tho and the bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the server was friendly. They had live music tonight (he is there every Friday night) which was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is amazing just like my mom used to make. The staff makes you feel at home. Wouldn't go anywhere else for our date night or mothers day. Glad to have shared our mothers day with our family at Las Fuentes. Thanks Roberto to making my wifes special day a great one."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed this place very much. The food was very tasty and satisfying. We ordered the sampler and everything on that plate was delicious. Our server was also very pleasant, he was attentive and quick with the drinks (which is a must for my husband). It wasn't crowded so we had a nice intimate meal but even when busy, the booths provide adequate privacy. Loved the decor and ambiance. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Spring Training.  So how did i start my Spring Training that fine morning? Enchiladas, taco, Omelet, Rice, beans, Chilli Relleno, some BBQ, a gang of Mimosas and some chocolate cake.  This place is in a strip mall sort of complex.  From the outside you would think its a little rinky dink joint but its fairly good size and nicely set up in there.  Good size bar top and two dinning areas.  The buffet was really good and I will certainly do it again next time I find myself in Surprise, AZ"}
{"text":"Great Sunday champagne brunch! Ezequiel, our server was the best! He stayed on top of those champagne refills! Loved the chicken mole and freshly made tortillas!!"}
{"text":"Ok so nice homely place. Stopped by to have some Mexican buffet. It was great food. One thing that lost a star was that the buffet lady was cooking food out of a mini portable butane oven. She also used the same gloves for every customer that walked up to her. The portable ovens were full of grease. At one point this lady left with these gloves on and came back 5 min later. Don't want to know what she was doing. Having said that, maybe that's why food is so great. I am from CA and this type of buffet is a little odd.   Overall delicioso!"}
{"text":"The waitress we had tonight sucked and we had a very frustrating and disappointing experience. The food was hit and miss. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Got the campechana and it was literally straight Clamto and zero flavor. But the drinks were reasonably priced and well made."}
