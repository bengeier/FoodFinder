{"text":"We had a 4 hr stop over at the Montreal airport and were wondering around stretching our legs. 
The aroma of smoked goodness caused our feet to enter the busy eatery. 
I wanted to get a Montreal Smoked meat sandwich but it had been taken off the menu. What??? This is Montreal...... 
I settled for a smoked brisket grilled cheese. I split the grilled cheese with my loving wife. We both agreed that with Oka and Cheddar cheese complimenting the savoury smoked brisket,  this establishment has a great bite on offer. I'd eat this again!
Sabine ordered the Dirty Mac and Cheese. This was an in house preparation of Mac and cheese with the addition of the wonderfully smoked brisket morsels. 
She said the pasta was a little bit too al dente for her tastes
Final verdict is that it's worth while stopping by for a bite and a brew

Cheers

{"text":"Welp when your flight gets delayed by two hours, might as well check out the new airport resto.  In the domestic departures area, near gates 1/2, where the old Moe's used to be is now the Pork and Pickle gastropub.  It has a nice clean look with rustic decor, barn board, jars of beans... and what looks like a well stocked bar and a decent selection of beer on tap.  

I had one of the specials for lunch, a grilled chicken breast served with potatoes, salad and asparagus.  The chicken was well cooked and moist, and the potatoes were flavourful, but there were only three sad overbooked tiny asparagus spears.  The arugula salad was nice and fresh but swimming in dressing.  

Service was friendly and prompt, I'd say it took about 10-15 minutes to get my order.  

All in all, a pretty decent meal for airport food, and a definite step up from the old Moe's.  Would eat there again.  I wouldn't go there for a meal unless you have at least a half hour so not a place to grab a quick bite before your flight."}
{"text":"Had a burger during a stopover & it hit the spot. Happily accommodated my request for no cheese or mayo & it came just the way I like. Grilled nicely & great flavor. 

Included a fresh & simple side salad with mixed greens was dressed with lemon & oil, which wasn't salted so you could adjust to taste. 

Docked a mark for speed (don't go if you have a tight connection ) and also for portion size (went in hungry & could have had more).

Busy place with open atmosphere, tables & booths. I might try the pulled pork next time."}
{"text":"Rolled into here pretty early in the morning on a stop over to Quebec. I order the tots and eggs and my travel companion got the cast iron skillet hash. I was worried I made the wrong choice because... breakfast hash. I mean, is there any other choice? Now I can answer that, there is! The tots and eggs! I was not disappointed. The sausage that came with my breakfast was amazing, it tasted like it was wood fired, and was full of flavour, reminded me of the tastes of campfire sausages. The tots were great, obviously, and the rest of the plate was pretty good too. I also tried the hash, it was, like the sausage, full of flavour and real good. Would try that next time. I heard the red Sauce that comes in it is amazing. Didn't try that. 
I really loved the atmosphere here, you could forget you were in an airport for a little bit. Not that you'd want to, the airport in Montreal is amazing! Hands down my favourite I've ever been to. The service at pork and pickle was fast and friendly, and the tables in the back had a great view. Would recommend for a breakfast break between flights!"}
{"text":"They seemed understaffed. I was seated quickly and my food came out quick, but it was a long time before the waitress came to take my order. I was never given a fork or napkin (besides under my drink) and the waitress didn't come to check on me until my plate was empty. The pulled pork sandwich was a bit dry and would have loved some BBQ sauce. The fries were that awesome kind of crispy outside and barely there inside. Just meh overall. I'll be trying other places my next time through the airport"}
{"text":"Ok. I realize that five stars is a bit much for any place at an airport.

However, I had a great experience here.

The recommended pork sandwich, while airport-priced, was substantial and delicious. The accompanying fries were served hot and tasted great. The draught beer was cold.

Isabelle served me at the bar. Even though the place seemed slightly understaffed, she handled service like a true professional. Her attitude and service were both exceptional.

For all the bad airport meals I have endured, I am really glad I discovered Pork and Pickle."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at the Pork & Pickle at the Montreal airport before catching my flight home to Toronto.

I ordered a Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich and fries.  It was just okay.  The bread was a bit dry and hard like it had been sitting out for a while.  It would have been nice to have more mustard (or a bottle of mustard on the table)."}
{"text":"Arrive early for flight, wanted a nice seated restaurant. Found the advertisement for Pork & Pickle Grill, then found the restaurant itself. Very happy with service, selection and price."}
{"text":"Near Gate 1, this was a wonderful find.  The service was impeccable and timely.  Our waiter was very attentive and provided perfect service.  The burgers were delicious, the salads were very well done, and the wine pours were generous.  The perfect stop before catching our plane.  Oh, and the super cute robot at the entrance was awesome!"}
