{"text":"I wish we had read the reviews before coming here. It was the worst breakfast we've ever had in a restaurant (we go out almost every day for breakfast), and 1 star is really more than they deserve. I understand they are in a tourist area, but prices are close to what you'd pay at a fancy downtown hotel: 2 eggs, toast and coffee came to $16.49 per person plus tax and tip. It's hard to screw up a fried egg, but they did. Over easy came out with crunchy brown edges and hard yolks. The bacon was tough, and the coffee, passable at best. Service was pretty much non-existent. Don't waste your time and money here, there are much better alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"There's not much more to say than has already been said. Worst restaurant experience ever. I've learned my lesson and will check Yelp from now on!"}
{"text":"DINER BEWARE!!!
The worst service of my life!!!
Do not waste any of your time in this place!
Now it's my fault for not checking Yelp before we sat down - but it has a great location in Old Town Montreal.
I would give this place a negative - 5 if I could!!!
- We waited almost 15 minutes for a server to come to our table
 - The servers seem completely confused and untrained and have no initiative or follow thru although there seems to be an adequate number of them. They had to be reminded to bring water!
-It took almost 45 minutes for our order to arrive ! We only ordered a Greek salad w no olives , 4 meat sandwiches and an order of grape leaves and hummus w pita bread  .Even though they are pre- made in the deli case inside it took Forever!
The salad came loaded w olives and the pita for the hummus didn't ever arrive until my husband finally went inside and demanded it and refused to go back outside until it was handed to him!
The owner says she is helping refugees from Syria- Bulls**t!!! Most of the teenage servers seemed Canadian and spoke fluent French.  The cultural origin of the wait staff is irrelevant. Just train your young waiters!!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE

We came in here for lunch. The service was horrible. Our good took forever to get our food. And we ordered food that was in the case. We also ordered poutine, and it came out cold. We had to get our own water."}
{"text":"Just want to start this out saying 1 star is being very generous!! We ordered the combo lunch (sandwich, salad, drink). When asking what our drink choices were to go with the combo we were told soda, beer, coffee, etc. and no up charge (total scam). We also asked for water for the whole table. The waiter returned with a pitcher of water (no ice) and 4 paper coffee cups that were previously used. There was lipstick on some of the cups, a lemon slice in the bottom of one of the glasses from the previous persons drink. When we called out our 12 year old waiter (owners son) he took the cups and returned with more paper cups that were previously used!! Really?? Who washes out paper cups and tries to reuse them? This was all before the food!! Cold soggy fries & salad with no dressing left us disgusted to say the least...... We went to pay inside to discuss our billing and other issues to the 14 year old at the register (owners other son) and he was very unprofessional and started arguing with us in front of others that were waiting to pay also!! They charged us for our drinks that were supposed to be included on the combo meal that we ordered. Don't waste your time and money coming here!!! There are so many great restaurants in Montréal but this is NOT one if them."}
{"text":"Took 30 mins to get a simple salad and French fries... the waiters were hanging out on the phones showing eachother videos while our dirty dishes sat there on the table for 25 minutes. Unprofessional. Food was okay, pretty basic"}
{"text":"Horrible service, tiny portions & very over priced! We had to ask for our coffee three times before actually getting it. I ordered the double portion Greek salad which when it came was too small to even be one portion, when I asked about it the waiter simply said \"well that's what we give\" as the other reviews said one star is too much for this place"}
{"text":"Thought I'd put this review in to balance the 1 star reviews. Service was fine, although they missed 1 item. Food was great. Maybe overpriced, but great location."}
{"text":"Came with the full family after a play at the centaur.

Service was... over zealous
They forgot 3 of the 10 items we ordered
The salad had no dressing
My club sandwich came 10 min after the rest of the food got to the table and was made with bread ends/heels.

I could go on but...
There are great Montreal restaurants but this is not one of them.

Do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The service in this restaurant is beyond bad. My friend and I sat on the table and waited for 20 minutes before we had to ask the waiter to take our order. 10 minutes later, that had not happened yet. The tension rose and we ended asking for the check which we never got and had to get up and head straight to the cashier."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE ! Il ne serve pas du taboulé oriental mais une pauvre semoule! 
Service 0
Le manaiche n'est pas cuit."}
