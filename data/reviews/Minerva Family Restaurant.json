{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch places.  Very spacious and comfortable dining room.  The soup here is some of the best in town."}
{"text":"Don't let the weed and thistle neglect out front deceive you--Minerva's is still open for business. Inside, the family-style restaurant has a decor typical of, say, a Perkins, and is a bit dated in places, but it doesn't skimp on friendly, good service. Food is decent enough at a decent price."}
{"text":"I like this place and would have normally given it 5 stars, but the last time I went, it was not the normal level of service I have come to expect.  It may have been that only 1 server was working the entire place or the fact that the salad bar (my perennial fave) was looking a little down at heel.  The soups are still some of the best in town and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Rocky River. Soups made from scratch daily. Untouchable prime rib at the most affordable price in town. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great meal at a great price."}
{"text":"You haven't really lived until you eat the prime rib at Minerva.  The place has fantastic food!  

Really, try the prime rib.  Just do it.  

Having a salad bar (remember those?)  is also a great feature.  I have eaten there several times, and have always been pleased.  My wife generally orders a fish dinner, and always says wonderful things about it."}
{"text":"DONT GET THE SHRIMP!!! they fry there shrimp so you dont see the vein in the back. They dont take the vain out of the shrimp. In general its a no-go for family discussion."}
{"text":"My husband and I just came home from Minerva's tonight and I had to write a review.  This is the best kept secret in town.  I had Veal Parm and it was fantastic.  My husband had country fried steak that was yummy.  Great salad bar, fresh and a big variety.  My chicken noodle soup was wonderful and my husband had the navy bean.   Also wonderful.  Rob our waiter was pleasant and we will be back again.  They take credit cards so that should be changed on the reviews.  Try it......you won't be unhappy.  As far as price it isn't bad at all for all you get and wonderful, tasty food."}
{"text":"Well, the outside could use a landscaping.  The weeds are a bit of a turnoff.  The portions are large and served fast.  The food here is really very good and CHEAP.  Credit cards ARE accepted!

Try the greek dressing (housemade) for your salad.......so good!  The soups are fresh and tasty!  Grilled Cheese always done perfectly.  Huge omelets!!"}
{"text":"I'd probably pass on this place. Breakfast was greasy, bland, and soggy. Service was less than stellar. The decor in this place is borderline embarrassing, but if you take a look at the outside, it matches the inside. It's relatively cheap, but I'd spend my money at McDonalds before venturing here again."}
{"text":"In my opinion I've never had food anywhere else that is as bad as it is here.  Sadly, I have been to this place several times over the years, ONLY because a friend of mine likes to eat inexpensive food.  I will never, ever walk into this place again.  If you do go there, DO NOT sit near the back of the restaurant, as I once did with my friend.  I was overwhelmed with a nauseating, strong smelling, what-must-be-industrial strength cleaning or disinfecting agent used in the bathrooms.  Also, do not look too closely at the artificial plants on the salad bar, (or any other part of this place), including the carpeting, walls, and so on, as you may well see things that cannot be unseen (lots of dust and signs of what look like years of neglect and proper cleaning).  Better to skip a meal than go to this place, seriously.  This place is quiet, though, probably due to the lack of customers."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday, (4:30) boy is this place on the slide (down)! We have been going there for 30 years. I had the perch, wet, sloppy. My wife had the veggie omelette, eggs were blah, veggies overcooked, said she smelled/tasted fish, must have used same utensils on fish (spatula). The salad bar was out of sorts, some bad beets, not up to par. If we forget, we may come back..can't forget, used to be the best kept secret, George must not be \"watching the store\" anymore? decore slipping, unkept, new booth tables nice though. it's a shame, you used to be able to go there and eat better than McDonalds for the same price."}
{"text":"Thank you Minerva's for the years and years of great home cooked, inexpensive, tasty meals! They are closing for good on November 23, 2016! Red Robin & Panda Express are building there. 
Minerva's had the best soup & salad bar around! Sad to see them close after approximately 30 years:("}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Food came out and did not look appetizing at all. We ordered French toast and they had only frozen strawberries and no whip. Sea food omelet was terrible. Shrimp tasted old. way too much artificial crab meat and way too much cheese. Eggs were burned. I would never come back here."}
{"text":"Was literally scared . The employees spoke as if no one was around. Topics they talked about included hangovers , drugs, drunk \"bitches\" that can't cover shifts, and calling 696 Kids on an employee that can't take care of their kids. It was like an episode of Trailer Park Boys. I highly recommend unless you like crazy hillbillies or are one yourself you do not eat here ."}
{"text":"Been to Minerva several times, and I really like the place!  It's a clean, modern, spacious diner and family restaurant with a good selection of food, and a nice salad bar to boot.  This is your typical 'diner experience', that is, good food with good portions at good prices run by a local, hard working family.  Much better value than the national chain restaurants too.  I'm a fan for sure!"}
{"text":"Been to a lot of restaurants trying to find fresh food for a good price...welll I found it...the food is super fresh I can't believe there is no line to get inside...ordered corned beef omelet...the omelet had real corned beef cooked to perfection... My girlfriend had the rainbow trout...seasoned and unbelievable...they even have a soup and salad bar that had the freshest vegetables I've ever seen on a salad bar with homemade macaroni salad and homemade soups...staff was very friendly and helpful...can't wait to see some other menu items....very affordable"}
