{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch and always had a nice meal, but I brought my family here on Sunday and was amazed. The restaurant was quite busy for a Sunday night and we all had a great time. Although they were short staffed, the manager was making sure all the customers were happy and enjoying their meals. The hibachi chef was funny and cooked a great meal. My steak was cooked perfectly and my shrimp tasted delicious. I think the prices were very reasonable compared to other hibachi/sushi restaurants in the area. I will definitely bring my family back here in the future."}
{"text":"Just ate at Feng for the first time tonight. Having been to other hibachi restaurants including Ichiban and Saga multiple times, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed Feng's atmosphere, the food, and the wonderful service. All around it was such a great experience. The hibachi chef was so funny and made us laugh the whole time, and even the servers and other staff were very kind and friendly to us. In my opinion, service is the most important part of a dining experience and they absolutely nailed it. You'll have a blast there. Plus, the food was delicious! So filling. I'll be sure to come back and try the sushi next time :) I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"You should definitely go here on Tues or Wed for half price sushi. What a deal!  I'll admit, I was sceptical.  I mean, this building has been several different restaurants and none have seemed interesting to me. Maybe if they put in windows.....I dunno, just something looks sketchy. But, it was totally good and we ate sushi to our heart's content for a VERY reasonable price.  I mean, nothing Giro would put out, but yummy, creative sushi that left us saying, \"yeah, I'd go back.\""}
{"text":"I was nervous to try this new restaurant out  but I'm real glad I did! The service was on point and the food had me all nom nom nom. The sake and the alcoholic beverages did not disappoint. I had shrimp sushi which was the best one I had yet. The hibachi dinner was delicious! I will be going again with my significant other to blow his mind!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews on Yelp, but figured I needed to for Feng.  I was pulling for them when it first opened, so when I saw the reviews I was excited to try it.  After purchasing a Groupon for them I decided to head down for dinner.  We rolled in around 6pm to notice it was a ghost town.  We ordered an app, some rolls, and a dinner bento.  The dumpling app was good but no better than you could make at home with frozen dumplings.  The spicy salmon and Mt. Washington rolls were less than bland, and had some odd textures.  The beef negimaki tasted fine, but there was just thr thinnest strip of chewy beef wrapped around a thick bushel of scallions.  Again, it did not have the correct texture one would hope for.  The salad and miso soup that came with the bento were sub par, and I did find a gnat floating in the soup.  My assumption is that they haven't been as busy as they would have liked to be, so their \"fresh\" ingredients have sat for too long.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong items and should have stuck to the hibachi.  Even with the Groupon I felt it was overpriced for what you received.  I'd rather go to Little Tokyo or Nakama where I know the quality of the food.  If I'm going for cheap Asian food I'd rather just go to Szechaun's in Oakland, at least it is going to have some flavor.  I'd say take all if the reviews for Feng with a grain of salt - including mine.  Perhaps if they get busier the quality will be better.  Maybe I went in on the wrong day, or like I said got the wrong items.  This one experience was enough for me though, and I will not likely go back."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. Sad they're no longer offering 50% off sushi. That was a huge draw so I don't go as often as I used to. But sushi is always on point."}
{"text":"I visited with a friend for lunch on Monday to check out the Grand Opening of the Sushi Roll Lunch Buffet. Regular price is $9.99 per person, which is a pretty sweet deal for all-you-can-eat sushi. Miso soup, a salad bar, fruit, and dessert are included as well. More details follow, but food was delicious, service was friendly, will return for sure!   Food: We ordered a pot of green tea ($1.50 per person). The sushi selection was quite large and included options with raw fish, cooked fish, vegetarian options, tempura rolls, and special rolls. They regularly refill the plates with small batches so the sushi is super fresh. This also means you have to get there quick to try your favorites! Wasabi and pickled ginger are in the buffet line and soy sauce is at the table. I loved trying all the different rolls--I prefer this over ordering a couple rolls at each meal in the hopes of eventually trying them all. Miso soup has to be ordered from your server, perhaps because they don't have heating implements in their buffet. In any case, the soup was delicious as well, with just the right amount of tofu, seaweed, and flavor (I often find miso soup too salty for my taste). The salad bar is also well-stocked with different lettuces, vegetables, proteins, and dressings. Fruit (watermelon and cantaloupe) was fresh and sweet. The dessert was coconut milk with tapioca. It was a tad sweet for my taste, but cold and refreshing. Overall, everything was fresh and tasty and I'd definitely come back when I'm in the mood for sushi.   Service: The owner cared very much about our experience. She was happy to introduce the different types of sushi at the buffet. Our waitress was also polite. Overall, I felt comfortable and at home.  Environment: Everything was nice and clean, including the buffet line counter. The lighting was dim. The restaurant wasn't very full (maybe five parties at a given time), but that kept things on the quieter side. This would be a nice place for a casual date where you still want to impress, but it's definitely family-friendly as well.  I'm still enamored by the idea of sampling so many sushi rolls. This is where I'll go next time I'm in the mood for sushi. Perhaps I'll try the hibachi at some point, too."}
{"text":"I finally come to redeem my living social voucher.  We had regular sushi (7 pieces of sushi + tuna roll), sakura roll and steak & shrimp hibachi. The sushi was okay. I left most of the rice since it wasn't that good. I like the sakura roll. The steak & shrimp had a strong taste of some kind of rice wine.  Overall, I wasn't impressed by any food.   Btw, they have live music on Thursday night."}
{"text":"Went with my husband for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday evening, on a livingsocial deal I recently purchased. This was our first time at a hibachi place. Upon entering, we were asked whether we wanted to be seated at a regular table or a hibachi table. We were told that at the hibachi table, we could order only hibachi, but at the regular table, you could order sushi as well as hibachi ( or, I suppose, anything off the menu). Since I came in with the intention of ordering sushi, we asked to be seated at a regular table. A few minutes after we were seated, however, I decided that I would do hibachi as well, and the waitress promptly moved us to a hibachi table.  2 other couples were already seated there besides us. I ordered the shrimp and salmon hibachi, and my husband got the chicken and shrimp. Each entree came with a small salad (with some awesome dressing!) and a cup of clear (mushroom?) soup (again, very good). Once everyone at the table was done with their soups and salads, out came the hibachi chef. Very entertaining fellow, we had little broccoli florets popped into our mouths from a distance,and saki squirted into our mouths. At one point, he shut off the lights at our table,  and performed some setting-things-on-fire show! Each hibachi dinner includes grilled veggies, noodles, fried rice, and of course, your choice of meat. There were also two little bowls of sauce for everyone ( one was a ginger flavor, the other peanut I think). Everything was delicious, and the portions were big. I got around 8-10 jumbo sized shrimp and a nice chunk of salmon sprinkled with sesame seeds. Both of us couldn't finish all of our dinner, and we had them packed.  We also ordered the banana tempura along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream . Beautifully presented, and the ice cream was particularly rich and tasty, not your usual blah vanilla.  The severs were attentive, and very friendly. Overall, I would definitely come back. Great food, great portions, great service, and thoroughly entertaining, what's not to love!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place has such a high rating. The interior looks old and outdated, which is strange, considering that they have a giant sign outside saying that they opened just two months ago. I love sushi, cheap or fancy, but I actually couldn't finish the Phoenix roll here - not good at all, to the point that I hope what I did eat doesn't catch up with me later tonight. If you're looking for sushi, Ginza, across the street, is MUCH better. The hibachi, which is I guess why people come here, was also below average - you could taste the cheap oil it was cooked in."}
{"text":"We usually hit up this spot when we are stuck at Children's Hospital. Hibachi food has always been decent. Other dishes are hit or miss. Interior is a bit odd (smells, layout) but we usually pick up food to go so it's all good."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Awesome happy hour deals and the people were so nice!! The chef gave us a complimentary appetizer! The sushi is amazing as well. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Went there for sushi. The fish was dry with a bit of an iffy taste. The decoration of the place was very old fashioned, kitchy and distracting, with laser lights all over the place. I would neither go again or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"It's a bit tacky inside (especially the laser lights in the one section), but the sushi was awesome. It's a comparable price point to most other sushi places in the area, but the quality was a lot better. This was one of the first times I ate sushi and actually noticed how well the rice was done/prepared. The sushi chef was great at presentation as well. He literally carved an owl out of a carrot and had it on the plate with the sushi.  I'm really glad a place like this is in the neighborhood now. Gonna go back sometime soon and check out the hibachi!"}
{"text":"This place its the definition of a hidden gem.   Why?   Well, first of all, we went on a Tuesday night and were one of three parties in the whole restaurant.   Regardless, the service is friendly and average paced.   The food is amazing, you definitely get your bang for your buck with the bowls, and if you get a sushi roll combo (ex. two chef roll and one regular, you can get for $23), you save a lot of money!  Good prices for good food and quality. I really recommend this place if in the area.   I will point out that the food does have a slight szechuan twist, particularly in the side hibachi noodles. Despite this, it was absolutely delicious and gave this establishment a particular style.   P.s. the Big Mac roll was especially fantastic, the mango on the very top of its many toppings was actually ripe. Being someone who has had the best fusion sushi rolls in So-Cal, this is an extremely rare occurrence."}
{"text":"Feng is a wonderful bazaar experience.  Don't let the outside appearance keep you away, the inside is a different place.  They have a large bar/suishi bar area which you immediately see when you enter.  Then you go around the corner and see a waterfall complete with coy pond.  You cross a bridge to the hibachi and dining area.  Everything is tacky, but delightful.  They also had small rooms which you can rent for small parties.  We got hibachi which was cheap for the enormous amount of food that they gave me.  They thew in complementary sushi too.  Service was outstanding.  I was very surprised by the beautiful presentation and the good quality of the food.  Seriously this is a fantastic hidden gem.  I am not giving this 5 stars because it is the best restaurant in the city, so don't expect that.  I am giving it 5 stars because I genuinely enjoyed my entire experience at this place.  Come open minded and I'm sure you will too."}
{"text":"Chef Sean should be cooking hibachi for Zeus on Mt. Olympus.  It seems that he took a break one night and decided to make me some filet and shrimp deliciouness instead.  Just writing this review has made me want to go to Feng's.    Ask for Chef Sean in order to maximize your hibachi-eating experience."}
{"text":"This place is simply great!  Their hibachi chefs are really entertaining. they put on such a good performance. The miso soup is really good and so is the volcano roll!"}
{"text":"Weird environment , but the food was good! It took us a while for the hibachi dinner to get started, but otherwise the service was good. Seemed like there was only two waiters on a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"Collin was a great chef. Andy was a great server. Wonderful experience. Food at hibachi grill was great. I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was great. Hibachi steak and shrimp was above average and the portions are huge. Specialty sushi rolls are presented very well and taste even better. This will definitely be my new go to place for sushi!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place - I get delivery from them a couple times a month. Still have yet to be disappointed - everything is just really good, very solid.   Highly recommend the hibachi noodles, the Pittsburgh roll, and the Special Lo Mein."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  It's so much fun, the service is great, and the food is GREAT. Seriously, the best cooked shrimp I've ever had every single time.  The portions are huge and the chefs put on a great show.  My fiancé and I love going here and everyone we've taken has loved it too."}
{"text":"Really really really good. Really good. Lunch with wife. Really really really good. Salmon and steak w/fried rice combo for me.  Salmon and chicken and noodle hibachi combo for wife. Really really really good.  This is in Bloomfield, by the way.  ANother one of those \"gee, I have always wanted to eat here, ok, lets do it, oh my gosh, why haven't I ever eaten here before?\".  This was that kind of place.  I was happy with the milieu, the food, the whole darned shebang.  Really seriously, I can see why people put it off.  But, here it is, they have their own parking lot.  And even though the Thai Restaurant is right up the street, GO HERE!  Then, go to the Thai place.  Then go to the Italian market up from the Thai place, and get more food.  Then go to Shadyside and get a drink, then go to Squirrel Hill and go to Squirrel Hill Cafe, get a dollar PBR and fish sangwich, and then go to Oakland, find a place to park (HA!) and get some Popeye's to go.  Then go to the Beer store, get some beer.  Then go home, but stop at Salonika's on the way home, and get an array of food.   Then eat everything.  Then fall asleep in a drooling sleepy mess.  Good times!"}
{"text":"Two words: sushi pizza. One of the best things I've had in Pittsburgh--and I had it delivered, so I imagine it's even better when it's more fresh in the restaurant.   Before you go cringing at those two words going together--it's a slightly crispy scallion pancake topped with seaweed salad, raw tuna, raw salmon, avocado and spicy mayo. Amazing. I ordered a few other rolls as well, and they were good, but the sushi pizza stole the show. I'll definitely be ordering again, and hopefully going to the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"I would love to review the food here but I can't. I ordered delivery from this restaurant to West Penn Hospital, which is less than 10 blocks away from the restaurant. I waited an hour for the delivery driver to arrive, and when I get the call that my driver was here I went down the the emergency room entrance, like I stated in my directions to have the food delivered to. The driver was not there. I phoned him back and said I was at the ER entrance, but I didn't see him. He spoke ABSOLUTELY NO ENGLISH. It was impossible to find out where he was or how to tell him where I was. I called the restaurant and told them he was lost and to have him go to the ER entrance. You know, the one with the GIANT RED SIGN THAT SAYS EMERGENCY and I would be there waiting. I received another call from him 10 minutes later, still speaking and understanding no english, and still not at the ER where I was. Another 5 minutes later a good samaritan called me from his phone to ask if I had ordered food from a guy speaking no english. i said yes and that I was at the ER entrance of the hospital. The good samaritan said the would attempt to direct him toward me, but another 10 minutes passed with no food. I have now been waiting 1.5 hours since I ordered and 30 minutes since my food was supposed to have arrived. I called the restaurant again and asked for my order to be cancelled as the man obviously could not find me in the easiest place in the neighborhood to find, and my food was no doubt cold by now.  Maybe the food here is great, I'll never know since I'll never be ordering from here again. How can you send someone out as a delivery driver that can't read addresses and can't even understand the words \"hospital\" and \"emergency\". It's just irresponsible and horrible customer service."}
{"text":"The sushi is above and beyond what you would expect from the price and atmosphere.  Well worth a visit from any part of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Okay...I've realized I've been pretty generous with my stars when you look at my breakdown.  But it's deceiving, I started Yelping not too long ago and have spent the majority of my reviews at places I like....and with that disclaimer, I bring you Feng.  I really want to give this place 5 stars.  Had it been my first review, I honestly could've done it.  But can I realistically compare this place to legitimate 5 star establishments?  Yes and no.  The food is pretty good.  Quantity is great.  I've been here like 10 times and have never had a bad experience...but the food is just a notch below the Smokes and Vandals of the world.  I honestly don't think you can go too wrong with any combination.  And the sushi rolls are pretty creative and tasty. Last time there I enjoyed the Feng bowl (which is a steal for $9), with the Mongolian bbq beef and flat noodles.  Great value, Umami would charge $14 for the same thing and wouldn't be much better.  Sidenote: If you're looking to get drunk, you could do worse than the Scorpion Bowl...share it though.  It will bring you back to your college days.  But, while food is a major part of an overall restaurant rating, there are other factors.  And Feng is five star worthy in several other underrated aspect.  First, this is probably the best restaurant in Pittsburgh to accommodate a large group (like 10-20 people large).  The hibachi set up makes this so...and the Hibachi chefs are very fun.  There's one guy in particular who basically parties with you and will be generous with the sake pours.  If you've been there, you know exactly which guy I'm referring to.  He is awesome.  (According to some, the fact that they pour sake into your mouth is something that no other hibachi place does, so that's cool.)  Another thing that is quite nice, is their ability to separate checks in a large party (most places automatically lump you together as one check should you have a larger party, which can quietly ruin a restaurant for me, as some people want to pay cash and others want to pay card.  You inevitably get the one person who just wants to make it easy on every and 'split the bill evenly' despite the fact that he's 5 craft beers deeper than anyone else, so he stands to wildly profit from the suggestion. And so on and so forth.  A pox on restaurants that can't split checks!).    I guess I touched on it a bit in the last paragraph, but this place is FUN.  The hibachi show is awesome, but the fact that they get a little rowdy and encourage boozing makes it feel kind of like a party (I feel nerdy describing it like that, but I also gave my groomsmen custom made lightsabers as a wedding gift.  If the shoe fits...).  Anyways...if you and your lover (gag) are looking for a restaurant...consider this...or consider something else.  If you and your friends are wanting to celebrate a birthday (which I don't personally understand why anyone who isn't 21 would want to do, but I realize I am the minority here) with a group of couples, GO HERE.  They will definitely take care of you and everyone will have a blast.  BEST LARGE GROUP SERVICE RESTAURANT IN PITTSBURGH.  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  Britney Spears...sure, she's not the Beatles, but the music is pretty damn fun, thus making it good, even if you're a little embarrassed to admit how much you like her."}
{"text":"It was very good! We were treated well and the food tasted fresh and delicious. We went on a living social coupon and got a great deal. Go for the shrimp or steak. Cooked perfectly! Noodles! White sauce! It wasn't busy so we didn't have to wait-l really enjoyed it. Good job!"}
{"text":"This review is mid-grade for a couple of reasons, to start on a good note, the sushi I had here was very good actually, super fresh and great quality. I like to think I have a good opinion on sushi/sashimi quality since I used to work in a sushi restaurant, I appreciate the skill of a qualified and experienced sushi chef and Feng has a great one working here. The look of the plating is a little weird, the glowing lights on the combo platters make the dishes look sort of like overly ornate disco ball shrubberies but I can understand the decision for this style 1) because it is a Hibachi place and ornate is part of that style and 2) the interior is absolutely dour. I don't understand other people's comments saying that they like the interior of this place, they must not have the background to know that the booths are literally from the original restaurant that was probably remodeled back in the early 80s - Young Bin Kwan. I mean the place looked super cool back then, it was like a fake garden with koi pond and decorative lighting on the walls to give an illusion of windows. Now this room just looks like a creepy old skeleton of it's former splendor though. I guess it's easy for some people to ignore or fail to notice this if they are looking at the decorative sushi plates, tiki cocktails, and the Hibachi antics. To be fair, the staff are really going out of their way to try to make this a nice experience. We had a very young and inexperienced waitress who must have put one of the orders in incorrectly and the chicken Teriyaki came with no chicken. We asked to add the chicken and in order to make up for the mistake, they fired up a Hibachi grill down from where we were sitting to cook the dish in front of us while we had our sushi. The miso broth was off, not sure why but it did not taste like a proper kombu/tuna flake prep it was more like the broth of an egg drop soup (ham) with miso paste. Location and ambiance are a big part of the dining experience for me and this place just doesn't have those things going on, I would like to think it's a work in progress but they have changed over businesses multiple times in this location and I think it would require some serious overhaul at this point."}
{"text":"Traveling from NewYork to Pittsburgh. Had a birthday party in here. The owner made us the special lobster rolls wrapped with sweet potato which they dont sell that on the menu. The owner gave us cakes , candles, and  appitizers for FREE because they said that i am the first one who celebrates the birthday in here. They have party rooms for some small parties. We ordered lots of special rolls and sushi which comes with 20%off. The food was fantastic. The outside of the building looks plain but the interior looks amazing. Love this place"}
{"text":"delivery takes some time but the food was fresh. I loved the sushi and avocado salad"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here. Came on time, the miso soup is a little bland without much flavor but I ordered the sushi bento box and was pleasantly surprised with the freshneas of the fish. The box also included tempura vegetables with good sauce. Would recommend for delivery if you need a quick spot nothing fancy or extraordinary just average japanese spot."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  I went there with my husband on a date night and fell in love. The food and service were both amazing. We went on a date night with friends, same circumstance on multiple occasions.  We went last night in celebration of my husband's birthday. It seems they have changed management. There were a few new servers and new managers.   The six of us were sat and waited a few minutes to order drinks. They took a little long to get to us. We got our salads about 10-15 minutes later followed by soup about half an hour after. Service had definitely declined. We began the hibachi experience about 10-15 minutes after that.  The food was good but was also different than before. The sushi roll was smaller by about 4 pieces but the price was no different. The soup was seasoned differently and the salad had far less dressing. I know it seems as if I'm picking but we eat here once a week and then all of a sudden... the hibachi was still great but the portion was smaller as I could finish it for the first time since eating here. I usually can't.   Based on the length of time of service, I doubt we'll be returning. We had a reservation but seemed to be an inconvenience. They also seemed to rush us toward the end. I understand they were closing but we wouldn't have been there so late if they hadn't taken a ridiculous amount of time between courses.   Also, I was told on the phone that the birthday treat for my husband would be an additional 8.50. However, it was 8.99. Not that .49 will break me but the whole experience from start to finish was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"The best Hibachi!!! They are so nice there and it's reasonable priced compared to Beni Hana or Nakama. The chefs do tricks and interact. My husband and I decided to host our rehearsal dinner there and they were more than accommodating and even decorated for us!! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Went for my girlfriends birthday. Had her sister and 4 year old son with us. Did the hibachi and some sushi. All of it was great. The chef put on a fun show that the little one loved. The food was great and they did a fun birthday dinner song with small free dessert. I plan on going back very soon."}
{"text":"This is an updated review . They would not honor the Groupon even though they have honored it before. Unfortunately,  they didn't really explain well what the policy and why they changed the policy.  Very disappointed at the communication for this coupon.  We ordered hibachi and some sushi.. since the sushi was not included.   Food was good here and the service was decent.  We will prob not come back again as they do not honor the coupon even though we have used it before here."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I'd give it 4-5 stars. The hibachi tuna lunch is great, the rice is done perfectly.  The minus stars are for delivery service, I ordered extra sauce, it didn't come.. and the driver did not come to my door.  And (while this was a plus) they came 30 minutes prior to time stated..."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fantastic, as were the drinks! The interior could use some updating and the building is very unassuming but the food was amazing as was our chef. We ordered the flaming drink and asked for no dark rums, and it turned out amazing and they were very willing to accommodate. We both got the filet hibachi and it was great, our chef seemed a little tired, and the others seated at the table were engrossed in their phones, which killed the chef's vibes a  little I think. Will definitely go  again."}
{"text":"Really good sushi. Weird lasers in the dining room and it kind of looks like a strip club from the outside but the food is awesome :)"}
{"text":"Best hibachi I've ever been to. Their hibachi cooks were so funny. It was always entertaining to watch them cook and make fire. The like their alcohol drink. That bowl made me tipsy. :) their sushi was good too. The only bad think is sometimes it was kinda hard to understand the waitresses."}
{"text":"I have ordered takeout from this place as a nurse many time and the foods was pretty good.  I was so disappointed with the experience inside the place.  I went for a birthday dinner 4/23/2016.  I must say the experience inside, not so good.  The place is very outdated, dirty, and cluttered.  This really turned me off and surprised me since I had already experienced their takeout food.  My husband and I had arrived early, so we stopped at the bar to order a drink.  I ordered a cosmopolitan.  The bartender (whom I believe was either the owner or manager) had no idea what drink I was even asking for.  I ordered the drink straight from the place's drink menu.  It was the most awful cosmo I had ever drank.  it was also brought to me with AN OLIVE IN IT.  As a former bartender, you shouldn't have a drink listed directly on your drink menu that not only you have no idea how to make, but even how to garnish.  While waiting for the rest of our party, we explained that we may have turned from a party of 8 to a party of 12.  We told them at least 4 times over the course of a half an hour.   At no point did anyone tell us this would be a problem, so color me surprised when the owner sat us and gave the birthday girl a hard time about it, but completely acted like we had not be informing them of this for some time.  Might I point out, the place was relatively empty.  Once sat, we noticed they had four open hibachi tables, one alone and the other two faced each other.  Would probably make sense to have the party of 12 at the tables facing each other.  NOPE.  Split us up between two table away from each other.  Might I point out the opposite table, was left empty until around 10 minutes left to out meal.  Following ordering,  the owner again came over and gave the birthday girl a hard time.  He was upset that the other table only had one person order hibachi and wanted them to move.  Hey fine no problem.  Except he wanted her to do it.  No.  I'm sorry Mr. owner, that's your job.  We told him it was fine to ask them to move, which he gave us a hard time and never asked them too.  I also want to point out at this moment I noticed the other hibachi table across from us (who also was part of a large birthday party) was not harassed at all and ALL 12 people didn't order any hibachi.  This really upset me.  The server took a good 20 minutes just to get our drinks.  The food was good, don't get me wrong.  But after the way the owner treated us, knowing it was a LARGE birthday celebration and now knowing the cleanliness of the place, I will not be returning nor ordering takeout from them ever again.  As a former service industry girl, it takes a lot to upset me, let alone write out a Yelp review (this is actually a first for me).   So disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't normally take the time to write reviews on restaurants that I eat at, but I had the best Japanese food that I have ever eaten at Feng's today. Members of my party had hibachi chicken, shrimp, lobster and steak, and they all were delicious. Even the noodles were extremely good.  This place doesn't look too nice from the outside, but everything inside seemed new and nice.  Craving Japanese in Pittsburgh, I highly recommend trying Feng's!"}
{"text":"We came here for my nephew's birthday and it was amazing. He enjoyed the hibachi tables and the fire. Definitely a place you want to take kids to impress them. We were given a 25 dollar gift card and 10% off our meal just for his birthday! (Definitely coming back to use that.) You can tell this place cares about their customers.The chef and servers were very attentive to us."}
{"text":"We came for sushi, and we were not disappointed.  Everything was delightfully fresh. The rolls were thoughtfully prepared and artfully crafted. I got the Caribbean Roll (baby lobster and cream cheese with eel and avocado on top ) and Eel Avocado Roll.(Because is there any such thing as too much eel or avocado?) My boyfriend got the Crunch Roll (Shrimp Tempura, Fish eggs, Cucumber, Lettuce) and the classic California Roll. My friend ordered the Mt Washington Roll,(Spicy Salmon topped with Shrimp and Avocado)  a California Roll, and a plate of coconut shrimp. We also ordered cocktails: the Geisha's Delight and a Zombie. The sushi rolls were all so fresh, probably some of the freshest I've had in Pittsburgh. The drinks were tasty too, although very sweet. The coconut shrimp was the only thing that was not satisfactory, it seemed to be a bit overcooked and not at all 'coconut-y'.  The only reason I give them a 4 out of 5 is that the language barrier made for some awkward communication errors (I ended up paying for a glass of club soda I didn't particularly want) and the lackluster shrimp. Everything else was on point!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here on Friday night. It was very fast, I think it was half hour prior to the estimated delivery time. So five star for the fast speed.  Now food wise, I think the food was just ok, nothing stands out. I got chicken hibachi and Pittsburgh roll. The chicken hibachi was alright. But the portion was big, big enough for me and my husband. The miso soup was gross, no taste, just water with color and few pieces mushroom, no tofu either. Maybe try to put less water? The Pittsburgh roll was good, the only thing was the eel sauce, it was very runny, I can't taste/see the eel sauce at all. Usually I would not remember what is on the sushi that I ordered, but on Friday, I only ordered one roll and the biggest reason to get that roll was the eel sauce. So points down on there. However I would not say the roll tasted bad, it would be excellent with good eel sauce on. I still enjoyed it.   At the end, I would recommend people who live close by and do not feel like leaving your home. It is fast and the taste is not bad. But I don't think I would personally go to the restaurant to do a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"REVIEW FOR HALF OFF SPECIAL: We went to Feng after seeing the sign for 50% off Hibachi and Sushi until October 1.The reviews and the signs lacked a lot of information about this promotion.  Turns out, there is a special 50% off menu separate from the traditional menu. The only choice for Hibachi is $29.99 with soup, salad, rice, two meats (or veggies). They inform you upon entering it is a forced 18% gratuity; however they do not inform you this 18% is off the original $29.99. The tax on your meal is also off the original $29.99, which I do not think is the correct way to tax. So all together, for two meals, we spent a bit over $44.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but if I go into a restaurant for a \"too good to be true\" promotion, I expect not to pay what I would for a regular priced meal."}
{"text":"The hibachi is delicious but not as good as the sushi. The sushi is easily the best in pittsburgh. The service is quick and efficient and it's a favorite date night dinner for my wife and I. I tell everyone about this place and encourage more people to come."}
{"text":"Your typical hibachi restaurant vibe. I went on a Friday night and it was kind of odd how few people were in the restaurant. The food was top notch, as were the drinks."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite date night.  I love the laser lights and 90's hits.  My last time there it was a Britney Spears music marathon. They do usually mix up the song selections.  This is easily the best sushi in Pittsburgh. It is fresh and beautiful. They have the BEST RICE!  I love the dinner bento box. It's more than enough food!  They also usually have evening specials!"}
{"text":"What a gem!  I've been here quite a few times since they opened and always have a great time! The ambiance is a little strange--laser lights and early 2000's pop greet you as you cross a koi pond (with no koi) to get to your table. But that all just adds to the charm of this place. And the food is just fantastic.  I've gotten hibachi a few times. The hibachi chefs are great! When I get steak, it's always cooked perfectly. They're also hilarious and really make sure everyone at your table is having a great time. They also shoot sake into your mouth! Beware the squeeze bottles!   The ginger dressing here is out of this world. Hibachi dinners come with salad. If you don't get hibachi, I highly recommend you get a salad so you can enjoy this dressing. The sushi is also excellent! Presentation is always on point. I tend to stick to the Volcano Roll, but you can't go wrong with any of them.   To add another note, a group of friends and I recently went to celebrate a friend's birthday. They really went out of their way to make her night so special. Every person working made it a point to stop by the table and wish her a happy birthday! They also gave her a free dish of ice cream with a very sweet message written on the dish. It was a spectacular evening out and the staff really went above and beyond."}
{"text":"I'm sad to reduce my stars this time around. The prices seem to be creeping up, despite the constant advertisements for discounted rates. The sushi quality is also sadly declining. The last time I visited, the salmon in the sushi was cut improperly, so all I got was sinew. Really disappointing. The miso soup was still your basic miso soup, and the kimchi was pretty tasty. I'm glad to be able to get kimchi in Pittsburgh, but I'm not convinced that I'll be going here quite as frequently as I'd originally anticipated. Still not bad, but not my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is great. Love going here and talking about this place. Their service is awesome. The food Is reasonably priced and delicious.  Please go and experience Feng yourself."}
{"text":"The hibachi was above average but a word of advice to the owners. Your restaurant is in Bloomfield not Oakland so a grand opening special that only applies to students is going to alienate more potential customers than it's going to draw in."}
{"text":"Hands down this is my favorite place to get sushi in the city! I am not exaggerating when I say I've been to this place at least 10 times in the past year, if not more. I have done the hibachi dinner as well as the sushi. One of my favorite parts about Feng is the atmosphere. It's never super packed and we've never had trouble getting a table. They used to have these laser lights beaming all over the dining room which I honestly miss! The choice of music is unique for sure... It ranges from Asian pop to Kelly Clarkson to country to Lana Del Rey's entire discography. I absolutely love it.  I have seen a lot of negative comments about the slow service. I'll admit, Feng is not a place you want to go if you are looking for a quick meal. This is a place you go for the whole experience. Make it your plan for the night! Bring a group of friends, get a couple drinks and enjoy!! The service, while maybe not the fastest, is ALWAYS friendly. And when you think of the intricacies of making sushi, especially some of the special rolls, you shouldn't mind the wait. The food is always presented beautifully with flowers and other garnishes as well.   Hibachi- SO FUN. You're going to pay between $20-25 per person, but it is definitely worth it for the experience and the amount of food you get! The cooks are all very friendly and put on a hilarious show, often involving the dinner guests by having them catch veggies in the air or squirting Sake in their mouths from across the table. They seem to do well to read the crowd and change their energy level based on the guests. Our cook could definitely read our excited vibes and was extremely energetic with our group! Each dinner comes with soup, salad, veggies rice, lo mein noodles and your choice of meat. I ate a ton of mine and still took home an entire meal.   Sushi- They had a 50% off Sushi special all summer which kept me coming back time and time again! it was a great deal, but even though that is over, the rolls are still very reasonably priced compared to what I've seen at other places. They have a great selection of sushi, sashimi, hand rolls and special rolls. They also offer combos which are great to try if you have a few people who want to share.  I can't get enough of this place. I ate there last night and will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"This place could use a little love.  The whole experience, from being dripped on by seeping ventilation walking around the building from the faded, narrow parking lot to the try-hard fusion vibe inside, is chock-full of sadness.  During our hourish-long lunch on Sunday, we had the entire place to ourselves the whole time.  They seated us at one of the raised non-hibachi tables, and halfway through our meal, they turned off all the restaurant lights below us.  It was almost like they gave up or something.  On the plus side, our service was an A+.  We built our own CUSTOM BOWLS and our stir-fries came out in about five minutes flat.  Our server returned our check so quickly, I thought she apparated.  The food tasted okay, not great, though I suppose you could say this has to be at least partially my own fault.  I concede: I'm okay with that.  I do maintain that I would have liked my broccoli cooked a tad longer, however, as I am vehemently opposed to undercooked broccoli.  You would think that with our private dining experience, they could have let our food spend a few extra seconds in the wok.  The little metal bowls they give you to fill up at the bar looked pretty small, but still resulted in enough stir-fry for a nicely portioned meal that managed to fill up my very hungry fiance.  I'm a big fan of choose-your-own-adventure dining experiences, so this whole concept and the execution really appealed to me.  They offered lots of veggies and a variety of protein selections, and there were also maybe 7 or 8 different sauces you could mix and match in little provided cups.  Some of the toppings gave the impression of not being super fresh, but that was just perhaps due to how they were cut--presentation left a lot to be desired.    Maybe my expectations were too high, but the limp veggies and hacked-up looking meat also contributed to the super sad ambiance of this place.  Dim lighting is prrrrobably supposed to be sexy for hibachi, and it sounds like, from other reviews, that this place does get packed at times, but when you and your partner and are left to wander completely alone amongst trays of canned, shredded bamboo shoots and water chestnuts swimming in their own juices around noon on a Sunday, it just feels like this is where bastardized Asian cuisine goes to finally off itself."}
{"text":"We love this place, the food is great! The only downside is we always order delivery and it tends to run 1-1.5 hours."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Talk about not judging a book by it's cover. If you judge this place simply by the outside you were so wrong. Such great food and the portions were ginormous. The service was impeccable we will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"These people really care about the quality of food and customer service. They REALLY care. Soooo good. I can't wait to come back. Ask about Leo's  sweet potato and lobster dish. Terrific."}
{"text":"A diamond in the Pittsburgh ruff. Great hibachi and drink combos. Highly recommended for groups looking for delicious food and an entertaining time."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a restaurant where the service is unacceptably and almost comically slow?  I think we've all been there at one point or another.  It's been awhile since this last happened to me, so I guess my karmic number came up tonight when I suggested to CM that we visit Feng.  My suggestion to pay Feng a visit came from having spotted a huge banner on the restaurant advertising 50% off sushi on Tues./Wed. upon cycling past this weekend.  What a great deal!  I thought.  Well, I guess the rest of Bloomfield and the East End thought similarly, since all of the regular (non-hibachi) tables were packed full tonight.  Indeed, I should have taken a hint when our waitress gave us free kimchi shortly after seating us, saying that we'd be there awhile since we were ordering sushi.  For half off sushi night, Feng provides a special menu listing the choices and the final prices from which you select your sushi.  Upon perusing that menu, CM and I decided to order the spicy salmon and tuna rolls.  Despite our waitress having confirmed our order correctly, we were brought salmon and spicy tuna rolls ($5 and $6, respectively).  The rolls were not bad, but not really very special, either--both of them were rather bland and flavorless.  Additionally, CM and I decided to order the midsummer night's roll ($13.25), which was filled with sweet potato and spicy salmon, topped with seaweed salad, and drizzled with eel sauce.  These rolls, by contrast, were aesthetically pleasing and much more flavorful, esp. with the eel sauce.  My only criticism was that the first one was rather mushy (presumably due to having a greater amount of sweet potato filling); otherwise, we were quite pleased with them.  As I mentioned above, my primary issue was that the service was extremely slow.  When we were seated, it took close to 10 min. to even get water, and at least another 10 to have our order taken.  As for the sushi, we waited 45 min. for each round.  Ideally, we would have placed all of our orders in one sitting, but we realized after ordering the salmon and tuna rolls that we wanted another type of roll, so we ended up waiting another 45 min. for the second round.  Even though we asked for the check as soon as the second round was brought to our table, it took two waitresses and 15 min. to get the check, and another 5 to run the card (at least that part went somewhat quickly)!  By the time we left, it was more than two hours after we'd arrived, which is unacceptable for the amount of sushi we ordered.  In light of the crowd and the waitress's initial comment, I'm guessing that the half off sushi promo has been more successful then Feng anticipated, and the kitchen and waitstaff are struggling to keep up with demand.  Based on what I observed at other tables, our experience was representative, since nobody else received service that was any more efficient than ours--except for the hibachi customers, perhaps.  If they're going to continue offering this promo, the owners and employees need to step up their game significantly if they want to attract regular customers.  As it were, the exorbitant wait and ridiculously poor service merit an even two stars from me."}
{"text":"This was my first time walking into a hibachi place, although my first impression was that they tried quite hard, perhaps a little too much. The inside was pretty nice with a few decorations, though most of it was kept dark for the hibachi atmosphere. We didn't plan on actually getting hibachi this time, so we sat at a regular table. However, another party did do the hibachi, and the performance was great.  We originally intended on ordering from the lunch menu, but sadly they didn't have it on Sundays (menu doesn't say that). No matter, we went with a chicken teriyaki and a nabeyaki udon. The former was pretty standard, although the portion was quite large and the plate came out sizzling. In addition to the chicken, which was actually a bit dry for my taste, there was also some broccoli, a couple carrot slices, and grilled onion underneath. The udon came with tempura, egg, chicken, imitation crab, and a bunch of veggies--this was probably the better item of the two.   Next time we'll probably try the hibachi. Their lunch prices are very reasonable, so that's something to aim for."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I have walked past this place probably a hundred times without going inside and boy was I missing out. I went with some friends and between the food, drinks and service we had a really great time at Feng!   To start, we ordered a couple Scorpion Bowls to drink. These deliciously boozy concoctions pack a real punch, and come with a flaming shot on top! Then, we moved on to food. There was lots to choose from, and we got a little of everything! Highlights for me were the sushi and the shrimp dumplings appetizer. The sushi was really the star, though! It was really fresh, creative and delicious. We got a ton of food, but the servers did a great job pacing everything so we weren't overwhelmed!   There is also the option to sit at a hibachi table, which I would totally try another time with a large group. This time we were only one of two tables, though, so it didn't feel like the right environment. Overall, Feng is a great spot for fresh sushi, strong drinks and a fun experience with friends. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes. I got delivery and specified no shellfish and a different soup. I know they read this because I got the different soup that I asked for. HOWEVER, my sashimi appetizer came with a giant shrimp on top and my chicken hibachi came with shrimp as well. Wha?!?  This was through Wheel Deliver and they fully reimbursed me. This is dangerously irresponsible and I'm, luckily, not allergic."}
{"text":"The food was very good. We got hibachi but sat at a table. Our waitress was nice and attentive. The fried rice was tasty and had nice big egg pieces in it.   The only problems I had with it were I thought that the extra sauce was over priced, and you could tell that the shrimp was frozen and not fresh.  But I can't complain- portions were great and it was very good. I'll definitely go back.   This would be good for a date night where you want to have some laughs and good food."}
{"text":"Is Feng the best Japanese food in Pittsburgh? Well, no. But it's not bad, and they deliver.   We first visited last October, for a friend's birthday. Our large party took a while to arrive but once seated, service was prompt and friendly. My toddler really enjoyed the huge flames of the hibachi; the other little one at the table was decidedly not a fan. We had eaten at Ichiban at the Waterworks the week before, and both my husband and I preferred the hibachi at Feng. The shrimp was great at Feng - much sweeter and less frozen-and-thawed than Ichiban's. The steak and chicken were good; the salmon was overdone, but hibachi salmon always is. Feng's ginger and seafood sauces are both delicious, and the miso salad dressing is one of the best renditions I've tried. The iceberg lettuce and carrot curls? Well, those are par for the course.   The decor is mildly hilarious - the laser light show is hypnotizing after a huge meal. The servers and staff were amazing with the kids - they helped keep them entertained while they waited for we adults to finish eating. The laser lights, \"dance floor,\" side rooms, and bridge with swimming fish gave them plenty to explore.  Last week, I discovered they offer delivery, and how could I resist? We shared a hibachi shrimp lunch (at $9.95, a bit overpriced for seven shrimp, a huuuuge portion of fried rice, a small side of hibachi veg, and soup) as well as salmon teriyaki. The shrimp, again, were pleasing for Pittsburgh shrimp. The salmon was again dry, but the teriyaki flavor was excellent and I loved the inclusion of grilled onions. The shumai are passable; I wouldn't go out of my way to order them again. However, the simple steamed rice was fantastic. Not sticky, not hard, each grain separate = perfect.   I haven't eaten their sushi; a California roll was included with our lunch delivery but I was way too full to even think about it. Maybe someday.  It's sort of the Japanese restaurant equivalent of the Cheesecake Factory, with a huge and varied menu and debatable \"authenticity\" (whatever that's worth), and most items of middling to good quality. Nothing achieves gourmet greatness, but it's not really meant to."}
{"text":"I love Feng. Sure, sometimes the service is a little slow or a bit awkward but they're really nice and honestly, I think the best value on sushi in the city. It's always good and not nearly as expensive as many of the other places. I'm not big into hibachi, but it was fun when we did it.  Plus, they always have crazy deals which actually bums me out because I really don't want them to go under."}
{"text":"Had to give this one a less than stellar rating.  I think the thing the is always upsetting is when a place refuses to make a substitute. Not the sort where it is something of a preference but a dietary restriction.  I asked to substitute edamame for a dumpling included in a bento box where the dumpling contained shrimp...of which I am allergic.  So I had to ask to not include it on the plate.  The thing was that my friend and I were the only ones in the place and the substitution was the same price. So why not substitute it.  In my mind, I paid for something I could not eat and all of the lunch bento boxes came with the shrimp item so there was no real alternative if I wanted the lunch specials.  I can understand if it were a pricey or specialty item I was asking for but really...it was not.  All I can say is, they could have done better."}
{"text":"I love coming here after work! It's never too crowded.  Service is always prompt and extra polite.  I've never sat at the hibachi table, I always order from a regular table (which makes for speedy service).  I don't like seafood, so I appreciate all of the non-seafood options.  This place is good for a quick lunch too."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for hibachi over the phone. Showed up and they said that although we did make a reservation, they took a party ahead of us and we will have to wait at least an hour. Awful."}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles and wanted to find a great place to eat with the family. This place is amazing!! The interior decorating is so pretty...the little details in lighting and everything is clutch. Not only restaurant visuals, but food presentation is outstanding!   We ordered the a bunch of appetizers including the Korean calamari, shrimp tempura, fried oysters, fried fish tofu, the Spider-Man roll, and we all ordered different hibachi combos that included steak, scallops, shrimp, and salmon. The hibachi entrees came with fried rice AND noodles AND veges. SO good. The chef put on a good show, did some little magic tricks that blew our minds and I also got the joy of having sake squirted into my mouth ha! I thought it was water...but no, real sake. I won!   Anyway, great place with awesome food and service. Definitely go here!!!"}
{"text":"We order from Feng on a biweekly basis. Good quality food at reasonable prices.  The rolls are usually 6-8 pieces and they go easy on the rice, which is appreciated. No over the top sauces, just good fish. My personal favorites include simple rolls with Yellowtail and Salmon. The shrimp  tempura is good. Specially rolls are available (they do a great Volcano and Rainbow interpretation) but I like the basics.  Overall, I recommend giving them a try. Start with an appetizer, one basic, and one  specialty roll. The soups and edamame are constantly tasty.   Lastly, a comment on delivery; There are not any crazy fees (a sore spot with me because I used to be a driver and never saw any of it,) which allows us to leave a larger tip for the person delivering the food. They usually deliver ahead of the promised time. We'll done!"}
{"text":"The interior looks amazing! We ordered tom yum soup, calamari, and beef wrapped asparagus for appetizers. They were all great. I forgot to take a picture of the calamari before I sucked it down. I got chicken teriyaki and he got quail egg and naruto sushi. Amazing!   I think they just opened. Its clear that they weren't going for cheap in the design. The plates are stylish, the chopsticks are high quality (relatively compaired to the usual wood) the seats are comfy. This place is a gem. Come check it out."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. The restaurant is BYOB, and don't be fooled by the lasers outside, the atmosphere inside is wonderful: elegant and quiet enough to talk. We brought a bottle of wine and ordered three hibachi dinners, one with filet mignon, one with scallops and the last with chicken.  All were great, but the filet mignon was a knockout. Tender and perfectly cooked. On top of it all, the servers were courteous and attentive. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi delivery I have found so far! The price is very reasonable for the amount of food that you receive with your entree. Will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"When I went it was loud af with kids screaming running around , loud ass groups of people and I waited 1 hour to be served."}
{"text":"I've never had so much at a hibachi dinner before I went here! I came here with 4 of my friends that quickly turned to 6, when my two neighbors wanted to join.  We made a reservation on a Saturday night at 730. When we asked if two more could join us the hostess was super accommodating.   We all ordered hibachi dinners and waited for the show to begin... and it did. Our Chef Obama was hilarious. He had us all drinking sake and attempting to catch broccoli in our mouth within minutes. If you want a real treat order a round of sake bombs and don't forget about the chef. He will then instruct you on how to properly enjoy your sake bomb.   Overall the food is pretty good, it taste like any other hibachi place. You get a salad and soup before the chef comes out. Then they cook the rest of the meal in front of you. The hibachi dinner includes fried rice, noodles, two shrimp, and some veggies along with the meat option you choose. I got the chicken hibachi and loved it. I do think they could give you a little more veggies. And don't forget about the yum yum sauce, they always have that served up for you to dip your amazing hibachi meal into.   I definitely recommend going here for a group of friends for a fun and entertaining dinner. Also don't forget to ask for Chef Obama, he is amazing!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover - this place may look like a tacky strip club from the outside, but inside they are serving some of the best hibachi in the city.  Inside, it's a perfect mess.  There are small children running around, the carpet situation from too many concept changes, the bar is so odd, but I love every second of it.  Take it all in, get to your table and prepare yourself.  The service has greatly improved since they've first opened.  For the price, you may as well upgrade to the filet.  We almost always get filet and scallop and the partner gets filet and shrimp.  The soup and salad comes out quickly.  The soup is perfectly spiced, not to salty.  The salad is on the small side, but the dressing is delish (pro-tip: the dressing is usually sunk to the bottom, so toss that baby around).    Enter hibachi chef.  These guys are great.  They are hilarious and keep the show going the whole time.  They do the volcano, utensil tricks, egg tricks, toss veggies, squirt sake in your mouth, it's non-stop.  I appreciate it because other places (ahem nakama) have become so pretentious it takes the fun out of it!  The portions are huge (rice AND noodles), really good quality and perfectly cooked.  Only thing I've tried here I didn't love was the chicken, but I've found at most hibachi places they overcook the chicken for fear of getting people sick.  I dig it  - I just avoid and go for the juicy steak and big ole scallops.  We've had sushi here before (so many options with mango) and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place. If you are interested in a Japanese steak house and want to have a blast, look no further. Unlike other hibachi places, feng's chefs are still funny and interactive. They have better prices than competitors I'd love to see this place to grow."}
{"text":"I will start off with the only two positive things I have to say for this place: - A++ usage of garlic (I'm pretty sure I ate an entire head of garlic) - The shrimp was surprisingly outstanding  OKAY, now onto the real part of the review, brace yourself (there is a tl;dr at the bottom though): Have you ever had an experience so absurd that if you described it, it would sound like one of those weird dreams where one moment you're in the library, then suddenly a raptor is chasing you through the stacks and then Oscar Isaac jumps out and pulls you into his spaceship to save you where you eat ice cream while touring the stars?  Okay, this was nothing like that, but we had the weirdest hibachi experience here the other day. It all started out on a normal Sunday evening. Upon entering, the host guy in a suit probably two sizes too big for him let us know that they only had one hibachi chef working that night, so we'd have to wait a bit. (This guy seriously looked like a 70 year old Asian version of Alfalfa from the little rascals.) That was fine and we totally understood the situation.  So he starts leading us to where the hibachi tables are and as we go past, we notice that apparently 7:30pm on a Sunday night is the perfect time to do repairs on one of the tables. There's three guys dis/assembling a hibachi table two tables from where they seat us. Like full on clanking wood panels, using a power drill, hammering nails, the whole shebang. This apparently couldn't wait until when they were closed.  In order to overcompensate for the loudness of the literal construction going on about 20 feet away, they turn up their soundtrack for the night - which was basically late 2000s club music. Like, I'm not kidding, that cliche \"Listen to your Heart\" remix played while we sat waiting at our table for the hibachi chef.  The chef, at this moment, is at the table in front of us (like we're looking at his back), with about 14 guys all sitting around the same one side of the table. These tables are made to seat EIGHT. So this chef has a lot on his plate... or cook top... whatever. It only takes him 15 minutes to finish up though.   At this point, the chef disappears for 30 minutes - I'm literally not kidding, I timed it, before reappearing in the dining room area at which point he stands with Alfalfa/host?/owner?/??? for 10 minutes having a kindly discussion. No idea what it was about, because we couldn't hear anything over The Pussycat Dolls song playing at 80% volume.  Chef finally decides to get over to our table and we've been there an HOUR at this point, just sipping on a \"Dragon Scorpion Bowl\" that tastes like college frat party jungle juice - minus the alcohol. Seriously, there was like no booze and all Hi-C concentrate.  This begins THE SINGLE MOST UNENTHUSIASTIC hibachi performance I have ever seen. The only words that escaped our chef's mouth, was confirming our orders and then when he said thank you when he left. His onion volcano was only TWO rings high and that was the ONLY \"trick\" he performed.  So onto the food now (if you've even stuck around to read this far), we all ordered filet mignon as one of our options. Only two of the cuts of meat looked correct and the other two were very decidedly NOT filet mignon. The grain of the meat when lengthwise - like this looked like a beef roast or something. He overcooked the chicken, so much so that it wouldn't slice up nice and neatly. And his portioning was WAY off. Our friend with the most expensive option got about 6 pieces of \"filet\" and my bowl of rice wasn't even filled all of the way. The noodles were WAY too sweet and vegetables consisted almost entirely of zucchini.   At one point in our meal, they started blasting a dance version of the happy birthday song, at which point the music choice for the evening switched to sad soft movie soundtrack songs (one was definitely from the Prince of Egypt soundtrack).   At every point of the night, I just kept thinking to myself, is this really happening? Surely no restaurant could be THIS bad???  Unfortunately, it was. And we dropped $70 on the sh!ttiest hibachi ever.  tl;dr - weird music, bad food, poor service, gross drinks, and even more..."}
{"text":"Was staying at a hotel and used yelp for delivery service. Delivery took a bit (I was worried because it was for a hotel), but it was delivered warm. It was a lot of food!  I had the chicken Katsu and it was good, the sauce was lumpy, I've never had lumpy sauce before, but it tasted fine. The minus star was because there was no soy sauce and chopsticks (-1/2 star) and the extended delivery time (-1/2 star).   I Would eat there/ order from there again."}
{"text":"I revisited Feng two weeks ago and a cockroach scuttled across the table just as the Hibachi chef finished cooking. The chef stared quietly as we killed the roach, confirmed what it was, and left it on the floor.  I don't really care all that much, I guess, I've probably eaten from much worse kitchens. But I won't be back.  I'm really disappointed because I loved this place."}
{"text":"The food was very good! We both got the Chicken and Steak Lunch Hibachi combo. Both the chicken and steak we're very well seasoned and cooked to order. There was plenty of food on the plate and so now I have a stomach ache, but in a good way.   Prices are affordable, especially at lunch. The decor is welcoming and my wife says it's \"super cute.\" I felt like I was in Japan due to the Japanese style pagoda decor and the authentic 90's pop music (ie. Brittany Spears, Justin Timberlake, etc). Since Japanese people love American pop so much. Ha.   Definitely recommend this place. It wasn't very busy so the Pittsburgh crowd needs to get in here!"}
{"text":"Very good food and portions for the price. I was pleased to find that my order came with extra sauce and veggies as I requested at no cost to me. The manager and Mr Feng were very courteous to ensure my order was prepared right and on time. I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"I take it back! Omg turns out this place sucks. Their sushi may be good but I'll NEVER order from here again.  Weve ordered sushi from here like 6 times in the past month or two, and today we decided to add an order of pad thai. It contained GREEN BELL PEPPERS, ONIONS, and either LETTUCE OR CABBAGE. That is not pad thai. None of those things should be in pad thai or have EVER been in any pad thai in the history of the world.  We called back to ask for a refund on just the pad thai since my husband couldn't eat more than a single bite of it, I tried it and was horrified too. This was supposed to be his dinner, like we have never asked for a refund before, we're not people who \"do this\".. it pains me since the sushi is good and now I'll have to find a new sushi place to give my money to.   They REFUSED to refund the $13 for the one little order of pad thai. The manager was like \"it's not our fault you just don't like it\" and we explained \"it's not that we don't like it, it's that these ingredients do not belong in any pad thai, and if you're going to use ingredients that don't belong then at least write them on the menu instead of pretending you're not doing anything wrong. UNBELIEVABLE business practices, I'm 100% sure there are places in Pittsburgh that also have good sushi but will have correct pad thai AND are decent people who deserve our hard earned money. This place does not. Soooooo disappointing."}
{"text":"Super slow  Waitress missed half of our orders The waitress did not bring some of our sushi rolls but insisted she did. In the end we were overcharged  The menu says 50% off but the original price was just outrageously expensive, making the the discount a mere marketing scheme."}
{"text":"We went to Feng for the second time last night with friends. It was even better than the first time I had gone last fall. I'm never a huge an of the soup, but that's just me. Service was really good. Our waitress was attentive, but not overbearing. Our chef was entertaining and did a wonderful job preparing our food. I got the hibachi steak and chicken combo and it was delicious. Both were so tender and flavorful. Honestly everything was very flavorful. The rice, oh man, even the rice was super delicious. I will definitely visit Feng again and you should too.    As for the decor, let's not judge a book by its cover, shall we? It might look like a strip club/disco and you may have to cross a bridge to get to the hibachi tables, but the food is top notch."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite place to go but it is not awful. My partner loves coming here and it is his favorite place to go for the hibachi in our area. He doesn't sit at the table to get the full effect he just orders is it from the regular seating area which whenever I come with him is what I do too. Is a lot faster but not as cool.  I usually get the shrimp and scallops from the Hibachi and it's very very well done. The prices aren't outrageous for what you get, I like that you get shrimp as well as noodles with your dish. I could go for a few more vegetables but overall it's delicious. The only problem that I can see is that they went down to only three scallops for the dish instead of the usual four. I just think that if you're getting a shrimp and scallop dish it should have more than three scallops. That's my only real concern with the place and the shrimp and scallop dish. There was a ton of shrimp so that's great they just need to work on their portion size of their scallops.  My partner always gets the filet and it's delicious. I snag a few pieces of his filet every time that we go and it's awesome. Is cooked your profession just so whether he likes it and seasoned with a lot of garlic. What more can you ask for.  This visit I was happy to see that the Olympics were on one of the televisions and I got to eat my food while watching the relay for the ice racers. I don't think that that's exactly what it was called but that's what I called it. The Ambiance is always nice they have low lighting and interesting music.  As I said before it's not always my go-to place but it's still good. They usually run some good specials and lunch is very cheap. I would say at least try it out for lunch and see what you think. My partner loves it and takes everyone he knows there I'm a little skeptical about that type of love, but maybe this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Food is bland. Salad was good. Apps were frozen,not homemade.  Hibachi was I better than any Chinese buffet. Then, to boot, wouldn't take the groupon that I purchased for there.  Wouldn't go back there for free."}
{"text":"Fake lobster not as advertised on Long Valley Roll Duck Burrito was dry and rotten  Only good item was the Main Street Roll.  $36 spent, $24 of which I didn't enjoy. $24 down the drain, nothing to show for it.  Restaurant offered nothing in return."}
{"text":"Worse place ever to eat. 1st, I have seen cockroaches just walking around on the bar top. ( my friend and I left immediately, and after I told them we saw cockroaches, the manager still got upset with us for returning our food).  2nd, I reported the situation to ACHD, they did an inspection to Feng and found mouse dropping instead of cockroaches.  You can find this report on ACHD website.  I will never come back to this place for sure."}
{"text":"Good food and the wait staff is always very friendly and on top of making sure you have everything you need. The hibachi chefs however aren't very interactive like at some of the other hibachi places i like to go to. I'd also suggest asking for light sauce on whatever protein you order the few times I've been there they have used way to much and it makes the noodles and rice very soggy."}
{"text":"Iv'e always noticed this place when getting off the Bloomfield bridge and I had a great excuse to check this place out when hubby got us a little groupon.  Anwyay, we opted for sushi instead of habachi. After reading a few reviews, I saw that the service tended to be slow so chose to be seated in front of the sushi chef to see him in action.   Our drink orders and sake orders were taken right away and we ended up deciding on the sushi boat for two which proved to be an excellent choice. Which had a California roll, tuna roll, and 16 pieces of sushi. All of which were quite tasty. This meal also came with salad and miso soup so it was a great value for $40.   Overall we left quite satisfied with our dinner. I will also say that my husband left his card here and we were able to reclaim it the next day without any issues given."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends. There was six of us. I had a maki combo entree and an appetizer with a small sake and a Sapporo. I daresay I really enjoyed myself there. I also had a water. The staff were very friendly. We were sitting in a private room. I enjoyed it very much. Thank you Feng's Japanese Grill & Hibachi!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here.  I always got delivery so I cannot comment on the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I want so badly to rave about this neighborhood restaurant but I just can't. It just seems like they don't care about customers. There's no pride at all. No pride in service, atmosphere and most especially the food. Saddens me to no end to say the food is nothing short of bland. Sushi never seems fresh and sometimes tastes odd. Wish they'd step up their game because this could be a great place.  Update: game stepped up!!!! Food is delicious and drinks spot on!!!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! We took a group of 15 for a family party to Feng, and we absolutely loved everything about Feng. It's spacious, clean, and very inviting. The menu includes so many delicious choices, but the hibachi was most extraordinary with superior and talented chefs. The shrimp, chicken, rice, and noodles were perfect, and the dipping sauces were the best we've ever tasted!   Expect attentive service, fun and playful preparation, exceptional food, and an exciting experience. We can hardly wait to go back, and I've been telling everyone o know about this exceptional spot right at the foot of the Bloomfield Bridge."}
{"text":"The order was correct. That's the only thing that was right. It was 45 later than the promised delivery time. Food was cold and when I called they seemed clueless about what they were doing. They didn't call me back to tell me when the food would be delivered and the delivery guy acted like I was an inconvenience when I asked for a receipt, he simply scoffed and said \"no, I didn't bring one\" as he walked away. Definitely a big FAIL!!!!"}
{"text":"We bought a groupon voucher for Feng. And I noticed that the food potion was significantly smaller than the regular dishes, and they charged 18% tips. The food is OK, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here with my girlfriend. We frequent hibachi restaurants around Pittsburgh, and this was amongst the better ones that we've tried. That being said, there were four people at our table that were incredibly disrespectful to our chef, which made our meal a tad bit uncomfortable.  A group was being very difficult with the waiter, after placing their meal with 15 different specifications (only onions, salt for her salad, no ginger sauce, extra yum-yum, two side orders of shrimp, one of steak, one of chicken, and the list goes on). There was, as expected, confusion between the chef/waiter/patrons at our table because of the difficult orders, but everything eventually got ironed out. A man and his wife were saying things like \"They are lucky we aren't drinking, or we would just leave without paying the check\", \"Hey chef, you are short a shrimp here\" (after receiving complimentary scallops), etc..   I would recommend you go here and act like a normal human being (manners, respect, and courtesy), and there is no doubt that you will have a good experience."}
{"text":"Feng is fun, slow and delicious. The bridge and pond is sorely missed. I wish I could couple drinking a Scorpion Bowl with major life events from now on. Having your first child? Congrats! Here is a booze soup lit on fire. Scorpion Bowls should be allowed at Children's Hospital is all I'm saying."}
{"text":"It is poor quality in my opinion but the fact that they deliver gets a bonus star.  Unlike some other places their salmon roll is a legit piece of salmon, not the pureed tar tar that some other places try to give you.  I do not recommend the shumai or the calamari.  The shumai was bland and reminds me of something frozen that was bought at Restaurant Depot dahntahn.  The calamari was completely over-cooked, chewy, and one piece was burnt to a crisp and inedible.  This place was a hibachi/sushi joint in the past and the name changed.  I am assuming the same people are running it (right into the ground, again) and I give them a few more months before they close down and re-launch with a fancy new sign."}
