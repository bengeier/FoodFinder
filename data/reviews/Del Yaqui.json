{"text":"We got carne asada burritos.  My first impression was 4.5 stars because of not many salsa options, but by the end of the burrito I realized it wasn't necessry. The meat has a ton of flavor and the tortillas are amazing. The staff  is also very friendly. I'll definitely be back any time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'm all for spending money on mom and pop shops that carry good food, but man this place really set a challenge. Worst customer service experience. Ordered the BIRRIA, which was basically bones in broth ( $9 ) asked if she can please change it to pozole ($8) without mentioning the prices. The rolling of the eyes,passive aggressive attitude, but the waiting for sure took the prize. Took about 15 minutes (no new customers were arriving) for the pozole to be ready, but instead of bringing it to the table ( as she did before) yelled out the order as if it was my fault the give out bones in a plate. The pozole was pretty good, but nobody should be welcomed with a negative attitude specially if I'm being polite and courteous."}
{"text":"Okay...someone needs to tell the truth about this place. Yes, I can admin that their food was tasty and cheap, but you get what you pay for! I ate lunch here with a friend of mine, that same evening both of us felt the effects of our authentic mexican. Let's just say that I skipped dinner that evening thanks to a bad case of stomach cramps."}
{"text":"I am so glad I went to this place today.  San Francisco has Chinatown and North Beach -- and we've got the town of Guadalupe.  El Yaqui gets 5 stars from me, because having lived in the valley for almost all of my 34 years, this was the best quick Mexican food I've had, period.

I've only been here twice  -- once with my fiancee and once with the whole family.  Both times it was great.  I've had the pleasure of enjoying barbacoa and carne asada burritos.  Damn, they were awesome!  And only $3 each!  Are you kidding me?

This isn't some Filiberto's gritty-meat, dripping with grease burrito, either.  The meat was very tender, the refried beans tasted homemade, the tortillas were tasty.  Delish!

The guacamole is what convinced me this place is the bomb. We ordered a large side of guac, and I have never tasted such a fresh and fruity, bursting with avocado flavor in my life.  I think this recipe is unique to El Yaqui, and it's my new favorite for guac.

We've ventured into Guadalupe occasionally for Farmer's Market produce, but we'll be going back a whole lot more now that we've discovered El Yaqui.  My next Mexican Food mission is San Diego Bay, which is in the same plaza, and I found out is owned by the same family.

So, the service was quick and friendly and there was plenty of seating inside and outside.  If you've never explored Guadalupe, you're missing out.  Start with El Yaqui.  Invest $3 in one of their burritos and let me know what you think.

Just a few final notes:

 -- some really authentic choices on the menu for the adventurous, including beef brain, head meat, and tongue.  Like I said, I went with carne asada and the barbacoa -- which were excellent.

 -- same owner for the last 22 years (her son was working when we went so we got a little of the history)

 -- $3 burritos & tortas; $5 - 7.50 combinations / plates; $3.75 - 5.25 for breakfast with beans and rice;  $2 Flan; $1.50 tamales -- yes El Yaqui has to be the best value around.

 -- Beer is served.

 -- open 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.

 -- you can't see this place from the street -- it's in an enclosed plaza."}
{"text":"On business in Tempe for 5 weeks and I've been her 6 or 7 times. The tacos are a buck fifty a pop and they are all delicious. I loved the barbocoa and the cabeza tacos. The Birria was amazing. Braised forever and so tender with just the right amount of spice. Try their sister restaurant on the other side of the market for the freshest seafood you will find in the desert!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to us, which was a little difficult to find. So remember to turn on to the parking lot then the gate will be visible to the plaza \"mercado\". I had the chicken soup with corn tortillas and the hibiscus drink (Jamaica). The soup was well flavored and the chicken cooked to perfection. My spoon easily cut    through the meat. The staff was very hospitable and entertaining. All my friends enjoyed theirs."}
{"text":"We ate at the restaurant this time. You can see right into the kitchen and it was very clean. 
Tried the Lengua, Carnitas and Pastor street tacos this time. 
The Lengua was my favorite. So tender! 
FYI if you need to use the restroom be prepared to have the staff give you a key attached to 10 lbs of heavy chain and walking outside...this might be the time to practice the buddy system... 
The beans here are STOOPID good! 

They serve beer too!"}
{"text":"My co worker came back from lunch one day and bought me a carne asada burrito from here and my life was forever changed. I had been looking for some bomb mexican food for awhile. The kind you get in Mexico! Authentic, tasty, fresh, and quality. I came by here to grab  food on my way home from work and I was happy :) I can't wait to try all the other things on the menu. If you're gona order to go, they speak Spanish so be sure to know your Spanish ;) luckily I know a few words haha but seriously I only wish I knew this place sooner. Just a little weird to find but I promise, it's delicious and well priced! Family owned! I am all for supporting local"}
{"text":"If you're searching for some good Mexican food, you should visit Del Yaqui.

It's in the mercado on the corner of Avenida Del Yaqui (which is PRIEST) and Guadalupe.  

The food is pretty affordable, and it tastes great.  I always get the Carne Asada burrito.  You should get the chips and salsa side too...they fry the chips right when you order them and they come all greasy and hot.  So good!

Bring cash though.  They have a minimum credit card charge, which is around $5."}
{"text":"It's tucked into the Mad Max-like Mercado, but once you get past that, this is the best Mexican food in this part of town. I've never had a bad meal here - I can't say the same for the far more crowded Los Taquitos down the way. Delicious Carne Asada on thick, tasty tortillas, and salsa with a real kick. It's all I've ever asked for in this world."}
{"text":"The food is reasonably priced and delicious! The tamales were amazing. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious and well priced. 
Man, do these owners know how to cook! Their food is made fresh with quality ingredients. If you are looking for genuine, hole-in-the-wall Mexican food, you've found the spot!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for more when visting El Yaqui, but it definitely wasn't a bad experience.  

I'd like to start by stating that I love the setup of the Guadalupe Mercado.  I wish they had more businesses inside because it has a really pleasant, town square type atmosphere.  I plan to try San Diego Bay at the next earliest opportunity as well.  El Yaqui restaurant is quaint and understated inside, I have to say I really preferred it to the atmosphere of some of my fav Mexi-Quick-Stops (Los Taquitos and Salazar Bros).  The Flautas (Chicken and Shredded Beef) were decent, but not entirely filling.  I'm used to leaving this kind of restaurant almost uncomfortably full!

The only downside is the modest menu and slightly more expensive prices.  If there weren't any options nearby I may consider bumping it up a star.  I would head back to El Yaqui, and maybe try and grab something else or at least hang out on the patio for a bit."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried Del Yaqui on Saturday for lunch. Yum!  Once we found the entrance to the courtyard we found two other restaurants inside. The food was very good and not greasy. Very reasonable price and nice proprietress. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican food in the Phoenix area.

They make delicious Sonoran style food from scratch with love - and it's authentic and delicious!

Their salsa roja is homemade, served warm, and really delicious paired with guacamole and their freshly made chips (served warm, pass the salt)! 

My husband loves the shrimp and crema burrito they often have on special, their chili rellenos, the small bite sized tacos, and their mole (yes they make it). I love their breakfast burritos and often ask for a vegetarian burrito (though vegetarians be warned I have never asked if the rice is made without chicken stock. It's too delicious so I don't want to know! 

The owner, her son, her friend who works with her, and the cooks are all lovely people. We have never had a bad experience and they are even patient when I try to practice my limited Spanish when ordering (fun for me, not necessary for ordering)!

You can even buy homemade chicharrones if they haven't sold out yet, and while you are in the neighborhood check out their other (seafood) restaurant in the same plaza and make sure to pick up some roasted chilies at the general store across the street!

By the way - there are other reviews on here which I think are for the same place, but they are listed under 'El Yaqui'."}
{"text":"Killer authentic Mexican food.  Just a diner atmosphere off of a Mexican courtyard (in the same place as another killer Mexican seafood resturant - San Diego Bay).  When I worked down in that area, used to drop in once or twice a week.  Went back a couple of weeks ago, and still as good as ever."}
{"text":"They have COCKROACHES! when I got up to the counter to pay, one small roach was running across the counter and a baby roach followed. EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!"}
{"text":"These truly are the best tacos around. I have eaten here may times over the last 25 years!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food ! I go for the Tortas . The menudo is very tasty , I would recommend this to anyone . The green chili plate is also a great choice . Enjoy !"}
{"text":"This is good hole in the wall Mexican Food.  It can be hard to find if you have never been before.  It is located inside a Mercado that is closed off from the street.

The food I have tried here is all solid.  If you are into Menudo (can't say I've tried it) they serve it on the weekends and I heard it is really good from a couple of regulars that live in the area.

I wouldn't say I would go out of my way to visit this restaurant, but if you are in the area and want solid and cheap Mexican food, check out Del Yaqui.

Oh, and the owners are quite nice to top it off!"}
{"text":"Our family of four had a fantastic authentic Mexican meal, complete with margaritas and a beer for under $50. Considering we were staying at the Arizona Grand, this was definitely a \"other side of the train tracks\" location, even though it was only 0.8 miles away. But the food was great, the service was great, and we didn't have to wait."}
{"text":"Best burritos I have tasted, love the Arizona Burrito and Lengua tacos. Well worth the money you spend."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service and hospitality was also good. Price of bottled beer was a little high. I did not expect to pay $25 (including $2 tip) for two combination plates and two Modelo beers. The funniest thing about this place was that they serve the food on glass plates but give you plastic ware to eat it with. I will go back for more but will probably stick to soda or water."}
{"text":"Terrible service, they messed up my order the fiest time (my fault for not saying without salsa) then I PAY FOR another 4 tacos so I can enjoy them and get the tacos to go to give them to my friends bf and they pack 4 tacos in a 1 taco container so salsa is now COVERED in my tacos and they got soggy. I asked the guy who did this and why would they do that and he said well what do you want me to do I'm not replacing them. So don't go there unless you want terrible service. Will be telling all my friends to NEVER GO THERE."}
{"text":"Had their machaca con huevos... It wasn't very good. There sopes and tacos are really good... 3 stars cuz the machaca was really disappointing. Usually I would give em 4,"}
{"text":"So I went here twice and I hated it the first time.  I don't know if I got a bad cut of meat or what, but my burrito was a bit too fatty.  I think it was the red chile burrito, or something.

Having said that, I recently gave it another shot and and went for the carne asada burrito.  Very, very good.  The cut of the beef is a little thicker than the usual Salazar's or Filiberto's burrito, but it was really good regardless.  Oh, and the beans in there were awesome, too.  It didn't have guacamole and I didn't notice till it was too late, but I'll be sure to get some in there next time.

Overall, I give it 3 stars because i really hated my first visit, but their carne asada is completely legit."}
{"text":"Don't be scared of the location, it's actually very safe.  

We've never been disappointed with the food here.  From the basic bean and cheese to their nopales con chile and shrimp.  Everything is always delicious, love their rice. 

The cashier/owner is actually very nice, although at first glance she doesn't seem very friendly because she hardly smiles!

The cook has his own taquiza business, but I don't know if this restaurant does catering or large platters(?)

Prices are decent for Mexican food."}
{"text":"When it came down to picking a lunch spot I saw El Yaqui and wanted to give it a shot... It's in this really cool open air shopping complex walk to the back and you will find El Yaqui. Walked in and the staff was really friendly they seemed to have a lot of regulars going in and out... I ordered the # 1 (3 tacos and beans and rice 1st taco Lengua   was really good 2nd taco Carne Asada was super good 3rd taco Pastor was good). Out of the three I would get the Carne Asada again really good salsa as well so this is a must stop for any fan of real deal street tacos."}
{"text":"Pretty good!  I went with some friends. We tried various things like the burritos, chimichangas, and such. I had the lengua burrito. It was tasty. A good amount of meat and the tortilla was amazing, as most authentic carbs are. :) the staff was friendly. I will definitely go back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"hands down one of the best chile rellenos I have ever eaten.  Big portions and reasonable prices.  The carnitas and lengua are great."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the Phoenix area.  I've been going there for, what, like 10 years?  Still perfect.  Still awesome.

I got two carne asada tacos and the carne asada burrito.  The meat is so good.  The burrito has the right mix of meat, beans, cilantro, and seasonings.

We'll go back for at least 10 more years!"}
{"text":"so today my coworker trace was looking for a place to get lunch, carne asada was on the request. i quickly jumped on Yelp did a search for Carne Asada in our work zip code and low and behold El Yaqui came up and it was pretty close and had a glowing review from Angelo C. 

it was confirmed that this place is not on the street, but instead inside a market place. 

the carne asada burrito is delicious, grilled and chopped meat, seasoned right, with grilled onions and beans. wrapped up in foil to keep it warm with a side of lime and pickled carrots and a salsa. from what i can tell from the beans in the burrito, they are awesome. lardy and smooth just the way they should be. 1 million calories later... 

I'm in carne asada coma now. 

if your in the area, or work around here. check this place out..."}
