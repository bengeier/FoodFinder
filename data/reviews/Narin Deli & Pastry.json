{"text":"Delicious hot sandwich with salami, Turkish pepperoni and grilled mozzarella cheese (the cheese itself was grilled before being placed on the sandwich - yum!). Tastes a lot like a pizza sub. A variety of good-looking soft bread choices that you may not have seen elsewhere.   The menu doesn't offer any details on the sandwiches and language may be a bit of a barrier, but it's definitely worth trying. Don't be put off by the unattractive entrance way and signage. Be brave!"}
{"text":"New Turkish sandwich/deli joint, pretty good prices for an all-in lunch ($7.90, with tax, for grilled cheese/sausage/pickle sandwich, plus pop and a brownie), food's a bit greasy as it's fried up on the griddle but have found it pretty tasty and has been reliable over a couple of visits as my office is just around the corner. Carries typical lunch-time sandwiches, plus some breakfast rolls with egg, coffee, also does good baked potatoes, and a big selection of cookies, baklava, brownies and other treats. Wouldn't make a major trek to visit, but it's a good change for cheap, fast lunch options on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I came across this Turkish place ,that has been open since 2 months from what i was told by a staff, by chance--and what a place! They have assortments of Turkish sweets and sandwichs. They also have boreks(cheese, potatoe etc). Had the potato burek and it was wonderful! Fresh just like i remembered it in Istanbul. Everything is freshly made.The baklava here is to die for, soft and moist just the way a baklava should be. Doesn't even compare to any other middle eastern establishment in terms of the quality of the food. Near Broadview subway station."}
