{"text":"One of my favorites in Elizabeth. A unique menu with some really creative and good tasting items. Staff is always friendly and provide excellent service."}
{"text":"First night of restaurant week and no better place to try out than Caswell Station in Elizabeth.  Great neighborhood feel and atmosphere, friendly and personable staff and management, drinks always go down smoothe, and can't say enough about the food.  Try and find something you don't like there.  If you do, I'll buy your meal...    The people that visit the first time come back, unless they were like this d-bag tonight who sat behing us and acted like a whiny b!#*h, knowing the place was packed, kitchen was swamped, and the servers and bar was catering to please as usual, yet he complains that the food took longer than his expectation. Management makes it right either way and comps the entire table of 3.    Dude was a joke and if I only knew his name, I would share so someone he knows can tell him he would be a better fit on Montford.   Bye Felicia...  Let Caswell's continue to build their clientele and be prosperous."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with 2 toddlers in toe. Sat outside on the patio and were well taken care of. Glad to have a new spot in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant. First, the good: -Fun, lively atmosphere with several big TVs make it a good place to watch a game -Good draft beer prices. $4 craft beer of the month, $3.50 Yuengling, $3.25 Miller Lite, etc.  But unfortunately, there was a significant amount of bad: -I asked if the veggie burger patty was homemade and the waitress said yeah so I ordered it but it was clearly a Morningstar frozen patty. When I showed her, she never apologized or said sorry. She just asked if I wanted something else. I ordered the nachos. -The nachos came out without black beans. When I told the waitress, again no apology or sorry. Just a I'll bring you a side bowl of black beans. The side bowl came out only half filled but I poured them over the nachos and began to eat. Overall, pretty tasty but what ruined them were the tortilla chips they use. Absolutely horrible because some of them tasted burnt like maybe they fry the chips themselves but over fried them. Yuck, so I only got through half the nachos before I gave up.  The waitress finally apologized for the veggie burger fiasco when she dropped off the bill, saying that apparently they used to make homemade veggie patties but switched to frozen because their homemade ones weren't sticking together. Still annoyed I was given wrong information prior to ordering because had I not said anything, it's almost as if they're passing off frozen patties as homemade. If they're not even using homemade veggie patties, it makes me wonder how much of their menu is just frozen stuff. I don't want to pay $10-$12 for food I can just warm up at home myself."}

{"text":"Great experience.  Went for restaurant week and had a blast with some friends.  Owner stopped by our table and made sure our experience was great.  Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant was previously Kennedy's. A regular lunch spot for myself. The building is beautifully redone, parking lot is still a mess. Order a burger with fries to go. Staff was nice and food was quick food was mediocre at best with a heavy price of almost $14.  Fries were thin and soggy. Burger was good needed some seasoning. Overall decent place."}
{"text":"Sat out on the patio on a beautiful Saturday afternoon! The \"Hail Mary\" bloody Mary was awesome. We had more lunch food than brunch - burgers and flatbreads and everything was great. Our server, Jennifer, was on top of it. I'm happy this is in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Went to visit Caswell Station, the first new restaurant/bar in the neighborhood since several closed down over the last year or so. I think it was soft opening, so perhaps they can work out some of the issues we encountered on this first visit.   It was Sunday Brunch and when we walked in, we were quickly acknowledged (great!). We were at first directed to sit anywhere, but then another server told us she'd take us to a table. There was some clear confusion between the two. We chose to sit at a booth. Unfortunately once we were seated at a booth, we realized how uncomfortable they are. There was about two inches between us and the table, which couldn't move because of the size of the table base.   We ordered the French toast with bacon and an avocado bacon sandwich with hash browns. The sandwich, which besides the avocado and bacon, had tomato and flavored cream cheese, was very good aside from a little too much cream cheese. The French toast looked nice and was topped with strawberries and whipped cream. Sadly the entire inside was undercooked and fell apart after putting the fork into it.   The service overall was very lackluster. Our server was very hard to find and seemed to have a chip on her shoulder that AM. We had to flag down a different waitress, who was much more obliging, to let them know about the soggy toast.   They removed the item from the bill, and the manager was very nice about it. Our waitress only came back by after the manager stopped over and crassly said something about the toast that indicated she didn't know about our issue, even though she should have since she was our server. She also snapped when I asked for more coffee that she was getting it, even though it took a while to come back by with the pot.   On our way out, we were nicely thanked by two servers sitting at the front, but one was eating a yogurt. Another pet peeve was that the ketchup asked for with the hash browns was served in a plastic to-go container, rather than a bottle or ramekin.   Don't think we'd run back here anytime soon, even though it's within walking distance and they did a nice job remodeling from when it was Kennedy's."}
{"text":"First time going there and i will not be going back. Waitress took forever to get our orders.  Bugs in the drinks and waitress didn't bring us silverware or napkins.  Never again!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a 5 star rating because of the food.  It was awesome!!! However if you are looking for a quaint little restaurant for your significant other this is not it. This is more of a restaraunt/bar where you are surrounded by TV's. That begin said the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and this is my go to spot. Drinks are good and the food is solid."}
{"text":"Went on the first night of restaurant week. Fiancé and I went to this establishment for the first time and overall we were satisfied with the food.  We placed our order and the server asked for everything at once since it was restaurant week.  It took a little longer than expected for our apps to come out but not an abnormally long period of time.    Philly egg rolls were good and so were the lobster corn dogs.  They were still a little warm but on the verge of being cold, but tasty nonetheless.  Within two minutes of our appetizers arriving the entrees showed up...  That was a little frustrating since we had just been brought our appetizers.  Entrees were good!  She had the pasta and thought it was a little spicy for her taste, but that is just personal preference.  I had the pork chops and enjoyed them.  The brussel sprouts were 'swimming' in the sauce that they were served with which I didn't like but they were flavorful. Dessert is were they lost us though.  Fiancé ordered the cookie skillet and it was two rock hard cookies in a skillet that she couldn't eat.  I guess we could have asked for clarification prior to ordering but it was not what she was expecting.  I had the lava/molten cake and it was just a solid piece of cake with some ice cream. We think this place has potential and will consider coming back in the future, but not during restaurant week."}
{"text":"Good menu with a wide variety of options.    I selected the soup of the day, which was a chicken tortilla soup.   It was delicious and I smacked my lips!  I also had a BUILD MY OWN salad.  It was a generous portion and the strawberry dressing was very yummy.   My lunch companion had the BLT on sour dough with a small bucket of fries.   It was all very tasty.  Unfortunately, there were a few things that were out of whack.  My companion wanted a glass of one of the wines on the menu.  That wine was not available.   Secondly, their towel dispenser in the restroom was broken and they just had a roll of towels that their patrons had to tear off on their own.   Finally, the noise level was annoying to us as we were trying to have a good discussion.   They have only been open for a few weeks and I am sure they will get better and better.   Based on the quality of the food, I would return.  I just need to take someone whose words I don't need to hear and I can already think of a few people . . ."}
{"text":"Mac n cheese pulled pork grilled sandwich!! Tacos and nachos all excellent. Server on top of her game. Lots of big TVs."}
{"text":"Great Day in the Morning! An absolute gem of a Lunch spot! Good atmosphere, the service was top notch, very attentive. The tot's were amazing! The wings were bar non 1 of the best around, the burger was great too! I also heard that the Mac& cheese was surprisingly award winning! Must try that next time! This ones a Keeper!"}
{"text":"I went to Caswell Station last night on a reconnaissance mission. Ever since Kennedy's closed, the neighbors have been anticipating a new \"walk-to\" place. I wanted to check it out. I only stopped in for a glass of wine late so I could look at the menu and see what it was like inside. Basically it still a sports bar type place. The difference is in the menu (some interesting appetizers, flat breads, sandwiches and main dishes) plus the red blend I ordered was good for the price. I will go back ASAP to have dinner and will update my review then.  Big positive: they give 10% off food to hospital employees. Yay! somewhere else to walk to."}
{"text":"Places okay water down drinks food is just a tad below average service is okay kind of cold feeling inside but I had to give it a try I'm not a big fan I rather go to Bang Bang Burger across the street"}
{"text":"Excited to see what this place is like during the summer! I've visited a couple times for drinks & dinner & nothing has disappointed. The service is always prompt, no matter where you sit & the food is great for dine in or take out. I love that they have some food specials throughout the week. Definitely a go-to!"}
{"text":"Oh how I've missed this patio! Our group of ten came here last night and had a great time! Our server Amanda was awesome. She was super friendly and on top of everything we needed. Beers and drinks were pretty cheap and our friends said the food was good. They've definitely upgraded the place and the high top tables and patio bar are a great addition. They have big tv's over the interior bar and tv's surrounding the patio. This is definitely a great spot to catch a game or grab drinks with the crew. It was a little slow for a Friday night, so get the word out and let's support this new neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"2 of 2.      Once  The manager received our review.  this is how he replied back privately..  Again wants to bash the consumer and is more worried about the review than the customer experience.    Jason, I'd like to start off by thoroughly apologizing once again for your evening at Caswell. I understand that it was a bad experience and not what you had in mind for a family's night out. However, restaurant experience aside, I take personal issue with a lot of what you rushed home to Concord to put on the internet. Your server absolutely cared, as did I. You mistake not caring with being overwhelmed. If I didn't spend any time trying to make it right then how do I know that you recommend going to Twin Peaks for the games or Union St. to eat a good meal? I said we'd do our best to make your night go up from a poor start...and the way you inhaled your steak there's no doubt in my mind that it did. See guys like yourself ARE the problem with yelp. Cat has your tongue at the table but go home and pound the keyboard. At least you know your strengths. We had a rough go at it tonight but I assure we will learn from it and be better for it. Maybe I can offer you the same opportunity...you see, we operate restaurants to support our families and make a living. Little proof from tonight, but actually are pretty damned good at it too. There's not a yelp for me to come cherry pick and post your worst day at the office online and even if there was I'd probably opt to shake your hand and tell you you'll do better next time B/c shotgun reviews like yours actually affect people livelihood. But hey, all men aren't created equal... that's just how the cookie crumbles, sir. Take care, Jason G."}
{"text":"Pros: Cool venue Great for a sporting event Extensive menu Good location  Cons: HORRIBLE parking It's a little loud, especially when games are on. The food was disappointing. It left a lot to be desired.  The cookie skillet was terrible. Had one bite and left the rest.   Would I go back? Maybe for a game or drinks and an app. I probably wouldn't get dinner there again."}
{"text":"Living in Elizabeth I am so glad to have a restaurant within walking distance that I love. The food was delicious and at a wonderful price point, especially for this area. The Sunday brunch drink specials will definitely keep me coming back each week. All of the staff were friendly and professional. I will definitely recommend Caswell Station to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"Excited for this place to be reopening in the neighborhood.  I've been a couple of times and they've been really slow.  I'm hoping this will change as people catch word of the new spot.  Food is okay and just what you would expect from a bar.  Not a place that I would say is great for date night but awesome to watch a game.  I had the 7th street salad and it was delicious! A little small for the price so you might want to snack on an appetizer.  While I'm at it.... pick your cheat day and DO order their cheese steak egg rolls!  The Caswell burger is great too.  It's a big sandwich so you might want to share with a friend.  Lastly, I've also had the quesadilla. Nothing to write home about.  What I expected.  It's the same layout as Kennedy's but with fresh paint.  Looks like they've added a little outdoor area to play games such as corn hole."}
{"text":"Awesome food! In total we ordered the dip trio, cheesesteak egg rolls, Hawaiian burger, fajita salad and mojito. Everything was delicious, but we would most recommend the dip trio. The pimento cheese and buffalo chicken dip were delicious. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Thriving. Tasty. Accommodating. Economical.  We went to Caswell for Mother's Day brunch. Started the day with yoga on the lawn, enjoyed our free mimosa and then dove into the brunch menu. The patio has ample shade and our service was excellent. They kept our water filled, the drinks coming and our food was delicious.   At noon on Sunday they have a DJ on the patio, what more could you ask for? A real Sunday-funday!  They have live music on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights too!  Highly suggest popping into Caswell. They have a lot to offer!"}
{"text":"Great bar in walking distance from where I live! This place is a step up from when it was Kennedy's, it definitely feels more open now. The bartenders are great, service is always fast. All of the food I have tried has been spot on as well. Glad to have a good bar in Elizabeth again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Caswell Station three times. The first two times were before the \"official\" grand opening. Those times, the service was great and the food was pretty good for the price.   This last time we went, there was a 20 minute wait despite the numerous tables open. I understand that people make reservations so we gladly waited. 20 minutes later our table was ready and we were told we would be seated upstairs. Once we got upstairs it was a completely different atmosphere with four tables, odd lighting, and music playing from a speaker in the corner. It was like we were getting shoved off into some unfinished part of the restaurant where they put people when they were too busy. On top of that we waited for 13 minutes to even have our waitress come greet us, even when the manager went in and out of the upstairs three times. After the 13 minutes we were done waiting and left. Don't expect anything close to the same experience if they hide you away upstairs."}
{"text":"Not far from what Kennedy's was. Another solid option for the hood. Service is still an issue. Let's be honest. This place is all about the patio. Which is still there. We shall see what happens when the weather warms up."}
{"text":"I visited Caswell Station for the first time last night. I had dinner at the bar with a friend and the bartender Drake was very friendly and familiar with the items on the menu to provide great recommendations. I had the $6.00 Caswell burger which is their Wednesday night special and a bottle of wine which is half price on Wednesday. The burger was very good and full of flavor. I had to leave before the live band started to play, but I will definitely be back."}
