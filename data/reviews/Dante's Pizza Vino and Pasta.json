{"text":"What has happened? Once a great Italian pizzeria now just above fair. The great garden salad gone the fresh bacon in the Caesar salad gone and last but not least the different portion sizes gone. The restaurant itself is beautiful but I don't know what has happened since it was taken over it's lost it's flair and really isn't that exciting to go back to. Why they decided to change what was already perfect makes no sense to me but if they decide to do that then I just won't go back. I feel like all they are is concentrated on making a dollar and not about the customer experience."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in Toronto, not to mention that the pasta and sandwiches are incredible. Fresh homemade authentic Italian sauce reminds me of my family's sauce. Dante is a great guy and it shows in his great food. By the way this is the cleanest kitchen I have ever seen"}
{"text":"Personally, i will choose salty over sweets.  The meat lovers pizza here is on another level.   After the first few bites, i didn't really notice how salty it was.   After about a couple of slices, i realize my glass of water is completely drained. 

The amount of toppings they put on is more than generous.  It is just too bad most of the meats are salty and when put together, the saltiness is out of control (even for me).

We also ordered the meatballs.  They were just a little smaller than a size of a tennis ball.  Very moist and tomato sauce was pretty good. 

Will i come back... maybe.  A day after eating the pizza here,  I'm still pretty thirsty.  If i get a chance, i will order other items next time and give a more accurate review based on other items as well."}
{"text":"Always an amazing pizza service until I found my salad unwashed. It doesn't mean I like the pizza any less!"}
{"text":"Now CLOSED.

Poor management ran this once busy place into the ground"}
{"text":"I'm happy this location has closed!!!  I remember spending $45 on a party size pizza that barely had any toppings on it.  When i arrived to pick up my pizza, none of the staff asked if they can help me, and I noticed a lot of attitude.  The customers were also very rude and basically lined up in front of me basically budding in line until there was 12 customers before me.  They all got their pizza and walked out.  A total of 25 minutes waiting and still no staff member to ask me what pizza I ordered.  So I approached the counter and asked a very unenthusiastic staff member if my pizza was ready, and low and behold, my pizza which I ordered now over an hour ago was up on the top shelf as it was sitting there for over a half hour, all the time I had been waiting.  So he passed it to me, I looked inside, and it was cold, soggy and with barely any toppings.  I was so upset and even filled out the comments section on their website, with no response or apology from Dante's.  
Again, I am very happy to see this awful place close down.  The pizza was far from being Italian, and their rude customers basically ate crap whenever they visited Dante's which I think they truly deserve."}
{"text":"Aside from massive portions, their pizza is disgustingly greasy, flavorless, and soggy.
Not worth the price."}
{"text":"I used to see their delivery cars all the time and so checked them out. $26 for a vege pizza that was average at best.

Abruzzo pizza is waaaay better and much more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The owners can go to the firey inferno if you ask me.  They lie about their frozen chicken cutlets on the menu, saying they are home-made.  The pizza is average chain pizza at rip off prices.  The only reason this place is busy is because of the few choices in the area.  They would go broke fast downtown Toronto.  I feel sorry for the people who suffer through this and worse for those who don't even know the difference."}
{"text":"I've literally tried every pizza joint around and this is by far the best. The ingredients are fresh and the sauce is savoury and tangy. is it more expensive than Pizza Pizza? Should they label their small a large and their large a humungous? Absolutely. Should I stop asking answering my own questions? Yes.
It's a bit more expensive but it's worth it. Trust me."}
{"text":"Fantastic portions for the price paid! However, it is not exactly authentic Italian as most of their food seems to be frozen and just reheated. The pizzas are huge there and they go a little cray cray on the toppings but that is what makes it great! 

I have always gone there with a few friends and we would always leave full and satisfied! Atmosphere there is not too bad, sometimes it takes a little bit for someone to come around to take your order but other than that enjoy with friends and family and have a good time! =)"}
{"text":"I feel that the overwhelming success of this restaurant has eroded what made it great in the first place.

solid food, big portions at a fair price was what made this place famous 

but I really think that they have cut down the quality/portion size and or increased the prices 

I made a larg order recently and I will dissect it item by item to highlight this  

Calamari $11.99 - was ok but it was a frozen pre made product nothing special not a huge portion would not order this again 

Breaded Chicken Wings (10) $11.99 not good, small wing (this was surprising when you consider they charge 1.20$ per wing ), this also was a frozen pre made product 
  
Crispy Fantail Breaded Shrimp $6.99 another frozen pre made product very small, reminded me of something you can get at a 3rd rate Canadian ized Chinese resto 
 
Homemade Meatballs $7.99 fine

Roasted Italian Sausage $6.99 fine

Caesar Salad $9.99 dressing was store bought nothing special 

Veal parm dinner $18.99 with mixed vegetable not a good value imo for this price it should come with a huge side of pasta, but it doesn't

double order Ravioli with Braised Beef $22.99 for a double order I don't think there was more than 20 ravioli, I think at over a buck each that's crazy price and I did not see and brased beef it must have melted into sauce so again not a good value

so ya imo there are better values in the area for Italian food 

hope this helps"}
{"text":"I find the food above average but the prices below average. Their move from Thornhill must have brought additional costs that we the customers are paying now for. First time in my life I have ever been asked to pay an additional .75 cents for hot sauce - tabasco was apparently free but Franks Red Hot Sauce comes with a surcharge ... embarrassing!!! 

The other annoying (and less than customer complementary) is their choice of delivery driver allotted parking spots. This is a small strip-mall with mostly successful diners taking up the units - customers struggle to find parking and Dantes has 8 spots for drivers taking up the area conducive for the customers to have an easy walk to their restaurant."}
{"text":"Well....last time I was here was 7-8 yrs ago. 

The service
-pretty slow 
-wait staff was very junior and inexperienced
- they charge 3 for more bread!
-female staff inappropriately dresses 

Food
-selection is typical old school Italian
-veal parmesan, spaghetti was good 

Pricing
-avg main is 21-24. So I would say pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Dined in the restaurant this time around. 

Nice place, very well designed and appointed interior. The seatback of the booths are tightly upholstered, they are on raised platforms, cherry wood paneling, beautiful looking bar area.  Some excellent carpentry for an independent restaurant. 

At the booth where we were seated I did find the table a bit high (2\" inches) in the torso area and I'm not exactly short  5'10. 

Found no problems with the service or atmosphere. I liked it. Great music playing in the background.. hits from Frank Sinatra and some Italian classics. 


The Meal:

We ordered a Dante pasta special with egg noodle and meat sauce and Veal Sandwich with mozzarella and mushrooms. 

The sandwich was large, a paninni stuffed to the gills of slices of breaded veal, mozzarella cheese, sauce, and mushrooms.  

Sure it's large but it's prep was a little sloppy and pedestrian looking (street food). It tasted ok but I didn't like the mushyness veal breading. If the veal was cooked fresh then placed into the bread the taste would be more crisp. I was not impressed by the sandwich.

The Dante special pasta with egg noodle and meat sauce dish I sampled was ok. It could be baked in the oven a tad bit longer to brown the mozzarella on top.  It wasn't as good as the ravioli I've had on a prior visit.


Summary:

Today I was little disappointed by the food. The veal sandwich and Dante special pasta with egg noodle and meat sauce was average tasting.

I will have to try the pizza next time. So far the best thing I've had here was the ravioli."}
{"text":"I went to Dante's a couple days ago as I bought a WagJag.  For the price it was well worth it.  I bought $50 for $25...so 50% off.  

That being said...things have changed there.  The menu are missing favorites of mine like the italian salad.  I would say the pasta and chicken parm still tastes the same but the pizza has lost a lot of its pizzazz.  I found it very salty and the cheese must have changed as it had very little taste.  I had chicken on it which was so salty and overcooked.  They now use (I am guessing) a marinated chicken breast that is cooked on a grill and have dried it out way too much that the salt is overwhelming and lacks chicken flavour at all...even though it is chicken after all.  I wish they would go back to how it was when it was on Baythorn...

But still worth the Wagjag!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered a pizza at 7pm. They didn't show up until 10pm. I called to see when it would be delivered after waiting 1 hour and 45 mins. They said a half an hour longer and that my pizza was still there. An hour later I called again and they ignored my call the first time  and turned off their phone the second time. 10pm my pizza arrived... By this time however I had given up and went down the street to grab alternative food. Horrible customer service. If you want good Italian, I recommend Paolleti's."}
{"text":"Went to Dantes yesterday for my daughters graduation lunch and had EXCELLENT service and the manager Sergio was a doll...... AN extra order of pasta was ordered by accident and he gave that to us to take home and then gave us a nice treat for dessert for my kiddo for her celebration (WONDERFUL Tiramisu by the way LOL)... We accidentally forgot her grad cap at the table and he ran and followed us to our car to bring it to us. FOOD was EXCELLENT-portions are generous and we will be back for sure! This is how customer service should be ALWAYS!!! Great experience :)"}
{"text":"The server was nice but every time she came to the table she was in a rush to leave. Also found the food to be bland."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and large portions! I love going there for their steak sandwiches, it comes sizzling hot with cheese dripping from side to side. Their portions was extremely generous, they definitely ensure that all their customers are fed before they walk out the door."}
{"text":"Meat lovers, nice spice lots of meats. Crust very marginal. Cardboard texture. This would not be good on a $10 pie let alone a $30 gourmet wannabe. Would not do it again even for half the price."}
{"text":"ERMAHGERD! So good...So Full!

Why have I never eaten here before? I have long heard the lore of Dante's Pizza from the Inferno of Thornhill - Good Lord this feels like the 6 months that I refused to join facebook...I never realized what I was missing out on!

Whether you are stopping in quickly to do a take out order or sitting in the Wine bar or restaurant the decor is beautiful. Classy. Clean. Dark wood. High backed booths for lots of privacy. Ambiance is set perfectly with old world Italian music mixed with 1940's/1950's crooner tunes. Love it - even for a quickie lunch.

After reading the reviews I walked in here confident knowing exactly what was about to go down. Pizza. A Wack-load of pizza-pie. And that's exactly what happened I looked briefly at the menu and went right for the super deluxe Pizza (salami, onions tomato green pepper and sausage). Upon asking my server which size to go with she recommended that with only me eating that I go for a mini... a mini?? Do I look like I'm on a diet??? ... \"No...but get a mini.\" 

THANKS BE THE HOLIEST OF GODS that I went for the \"mini\"  - whose name is a BOLDFACED LIE, that is not a mini at all... it's an XL disguised as a mini. The beautiful crust was crispy and thin while the toppings were HUGE, there is absolutely no skimping on them either, they cover these pizza bad boys right to the edge of the pie with toppings (crust to crust one might add). I really don't know how that thin little crust supported the near 2 inches of toppings

I only made it through 1/2 before I wanted to die. So stuffed. OMFG!!

The service was fast, friendly and attentive and really in my mind they only lose a star for the high prices. The mini pizza comes at a price tag of $22. But with the plentiful cornucopia of toppings I can see why they charge what they do. Looking forward to returning to try the pasta and Vino @ Dante's

Thanks for a great lunch!!!"}
{"text":"A really great place for pasta and pizza... well duh!
Large portion sizes for the price!
Small pizza can feed me for three days, loaded with toppings!
Seafood pasta filled with seafood, so impressed by the amount! They certainly don't skimp.
I took my mom here for her birthday, she loved it. Four people to eat and drink for $80 plus tax and tip... I love it.
Brought my cousins from New York to get take out... they were impressed. We spent that night catching up over ravioli and pizza... it was awesome.
The service is okay, I don't have much to say cause I never interacted much with the servers.
The atmosphere is nice, simple."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Very traditional Italian food with home made tomato sauce."}
{"text":"$50 for a pizza that cost you a buck or two to make. Who the heck do you and your family think you are.  Give your Damn heads a shake.. I even overheard dantes brother the lead cook bad talking an employee while I waited for my overpriced pizza. Shame on you for insulting staff members who are most likely super hard working and who you probably under pay. You have no right to treat ppl like that. Bet you didn't think anyone heard that eh.. or maybe you wanted everyone to hear it.  Well I did. I hope you hear this. You guys are pathetic. So was that $50 pizza."}
{"text":"What a lovely dining room. The service is always good. The food is consistently excellent.This would be my go to place for a special dinner out with the family or just a date. It is a bit pricey but remember you also get what you pay for. Enjoy"}
{"text":"We used to order take out periodically and found the food to be good. My kids like the pasta in particular. We ordered take out last night for the first time since the change in management. The food was unfortunately not as good. Pasta sauce was oilier and saltier. The consistency was different. Even my children noticed it was not as good. The only thing that was better was the small panini that we got with our meal was the crusty kind (as opposed to the soft roll they used to give us). Unfortunately that's not enough for us to return.  We didn't expect the food quality to change when the mgt left but sadly it did."}
{"text":"The original owners, including Dante himself, were forced out about a year ago. Dante Paoletti along with his three bothers have opened a small takeout with all the great food, including their famous sausage, across from the Dante's store they once owned. Visit Paoletti's at 8700 Dufferin St in Vaughan."}
{"text":"It has been said, you can have a good meal with bad company, and your overall experience will not be good. 
Also, a mediocre meal with great company is a great meal. 
My experience at this restaurant was perfect. 
I met up with a great friend and his wife. We shared the supreme deluxe pizza. This pizza was delicious. I found the atmosphere to be just perfect. The waitress must have been good. As I don't really remember her, I know she brought us food and drinks. But she was there when we needed her, yet she wasn't annoying. 
I must say, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We held a UYE here for almost a dozen fellow Yelpers to continue on our quest for the Perfect Pizza iteration #4.  This time it was held in Vaughan in the Thornhill section near Hwy 7 and Dufferin St at Dante's Pizza.

We had what could be considered a private room in the back of the restaurant.

I had ordered an Okanagan pale ale while another person ordered a Creemore Springs.  I had noticed which I thought was kind of nice is that whatever you ordered on tap, the glass would be of that beer.  This was evident when others ordered different beers and everything came in the appropriate glass for whatever brand it was.  This really helps when wanting another drink!

We were there for pizza so almost everybody had ordered that.  The size and what we were going to order was the question.  Most every couple went with medium.  I went with large knowing I'd want left overs for lunch which is what I usually do when I order pizza.

The pizza took a while to make but they were in fact huge.  Pretty much each couple ordered either the super deluxe or meat lovers and we swapped slices around so everybody got to try both.

I found the pizza to be really a lot of food and the servings were huge.  The toppings were really very good but overall the pizza was salty, the crust was very crunchy.  The food was good still but to me it was just good, not great.  I did enjoy it though but for the price it's sort of expensive.  The large 18\" pizza run about 35 dollars.  

The meat is especially salty but I still liked it.  What would you expect as it has 5 different meats!  

Overall the evening was really fun.  It's never a bad time getting together with fellow Yelpers.  The food was good too but if I had to only judge it on the pizza, the bang for the buck is about average."}
{"text":"Come here for company dinners.. The food is really good and I'd go back more often if it was closer. Pricing is typical, maybe on the higher side but still good. Ordered 3 items + a drink and came out to be $70 with tips and tax. I recommend this place to everyone, if you don't have to pay in full :)"}
{"text":"I came here for a UYE quest for perfect pizza with some elites and their +1s. Overall it was a great night but mainly due to the company and not the food.

2 stars = Meh I have had better (to be fair I used to live in Chicago). Pizza selections were very minimal, pretty much basic, deluxe, and meat lovers. But then you can custom build your own pizza. Pizza was served on a pizza stand. Portions were American! Crust and toppings were fresh but the recipe was just ordinary and nothing special.

I did order a pint & wings and honestly sports bars have cheaper and way better wings. I was really disappointed. 1 star for wings.

Overall I think the quest for perfect pizza is going to take a while. We might have to take a trip to Chicago!"}
{"text":"Modern decor, spacious, don't have to wait for a table, great service, great food at a reasonable price. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been eating Dante's for 20 years.  I moved to Thornhill Woods the same year they did.  Since the move and since they sold out after bankruptcy, the quality has been hit or miss.  

I rarely get the pizza any more, since the quality just is not consistent, which for those prices, you should at least know what to expect.  Same for the sandwiches.  There was a time during university years that I ordered a steak sandwich every week, but now it's not the same.  Undercooked vegetables or hardened bun.  

What is good 1) the gravy (tomato sauce) and 2) most of the pasta dishes.  This delivers well.  The short rib ravioli is really good, bright red sauce, tender shredded beef.

Also since they moved, the restaurant is done up nice and it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"I love this place I've been coming here since ive been 4. 8 year ago. I love it. The veal sandwich to the pizza and pasta are to die for. I love this restaurant. Ps the owners are real nice"}
{"text":"We hadn't indulged in quite a while but did last night and were very happy.
Ordered:
-mini double pepperoni pizza... Outstanding.. Meat slightly charred, crust chewy and delicious... Perfect
-side of meatball... Delicious , awesome sauce to dip garlic bread
-Caesar salad- was passable..

I heard rumours it was going downhill over there, not the case at all, quick delivery and everything was hot, delicious and expensive!"}
{"text":"My experience is mixed. Things started off poorly. We ordered drinks and someone got a cup of hot water. Waitress said it cost 1.50 but she's not going to charge us. Why even day that. While ordering food she was quite abrupt. We had brushetta appetizer. It was bad (taste, toppings and bread). 

The meal turned around when the pizza came. I chose the make your own and it was decent. Nothing special. My friend said he's tasted like it was under the heat lamp while the other meals were being finished. 

Will I go back? No."}
{"text":"Dante's is where you come if you don't feel like being getting all fancy (read: spend that $$$$) for Italian fine dining, but want to eat something that is higher quality than Pizza Hut/Pizza Pizza/Pizza Nova/any other pizza place you would find on Just-eat.ca. 

They are extremely generous with their toppings, both in terms of quality and quantity. I loved their Meat Lovers' pizza, where the layer of meat alone is about half of the thickness of the crust. And in a pie where the the thickness of the crust is as close as you can get to the crust thickness of a Chicago deep dish pizza in Toronto, that is saying a lot. You should also be warned that this was on the greasy side. My heart was having none of it after a few slices, but it was worth every palpitation."}
{"text":"Positives: large portions and not too expensive. Good variety of pizza toppings. Atmosphere is what it should be for a bustling neighborhood place in the burbs. 

Negatives: Just can't get passed the blandness of the food. The pasta meat sauce is very oily, the veal sandwich is big but the bread is not crusty enough to stand up to the sauce and comes out mushy. The pizzas are ridiculously large, even the smallest can feed three people, but all thought the ingredients are laid on well the dough is very heavy. The minestrone is always served piping hot but is just OK. 


Good place for kids or if you really like bland food."}
{"text":"Finally they lowered their prices!

For several years now Dante was the pizza Nazi and had crazy high prices that kept going up.

It wasn't until the original owner defected and moved across the street with an identical but cheaper menu did they realize they needed to change.

With Paolettis pizza offering the same great menu at a cheaper price, Dante's had to concede.

Not the cheapest in town but better than before.

Still quality food and excellent pizza!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious before the new idiot owners took over. Seems like they not only changed the prices but the quality of their food. We ordered the linguine pescatore for delivery it was nasty! Dry! It was spaghetti! Yyyuuuucccckkkkk!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went for a UYE with fellow yelpers. We arrived late after everyone else in the group had already placed an order. However, no one came to check in on us. We had to go and seek out the waitress ourselves in order to place our orders. I also had to get them to get us some drinks. While it is understandable that they were busy and we were a big group but that is no excuse for ignoring us.

After placing our order we had to wait almost an hour until they got our food. Everybody was starving by now and almost anything would have tasted good to us I guess. We ordered a small Meatlovers pizza to share between me and my +1. The pizza was loaded with toppings and I liked some of the toppings but it was way too salty. When we placed our order no one told us we could choose a crust, so we ended up getting a thick crust. It was too much dough for me. I could hardly finish one slice. Personally, I would prefer Pizzaiolo's Sicilian pizza to this. We asked our waitress for chilli flakes to add some flavour (other than salt) to our pizza but we never got any.

I had high expectations after hearing good reviews about the place but the food and the service did leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I've been eating Dante's pizza since the original back in Thornhill.  The super deluxe is still the best pie in the GTA.  Period.  My only gripe is that it's way too expensive"}
{"text":"Not the same pizza I remember. Don't think the original Dante is there anymore. Pizza was average at best.  Ordered wine but they didn't have the first 3 kinds I selected. I ended up with a mediocre bottle which they refused to honor at the price of my choice bottle. With that said, the whole dinner was over priced. Salad, pizza and bottle of wine plus tax/tip = $100+.  At that price I'll take my night downtown better!"}
{"text":"Split review
Meat Lover pizza, thin crust - 4 stars
Waiting time for food - 2 stars

We came for an unofficial Yelp event to sink our teeth in Dante's famous pizza.  I heard great things about them before, so I was pretty excited.  Upon entry, the venue was beautiful.  Dante's doesn't look like a pizza joint; it looks like a casual fine dining restaurant.  We had a party room at the back all by ourselves, too.  We ordered a medium Meat Lover Pizza with thin crust.  The pizza was drown in toppings.  It was loaded with bacon and sausage, from rim to rim, edge to edge.  The flavours was intense.  Intensively salty it was.  I love sodium so I love this pizza.  

Some people at the UYE ordered the Super Deluxe pizza.  We bartered a slice, and I liked my meat lover pizza more because of the sodium.  If you are not sodium lover, meat lover can easily overwhelm you, then you are advised to opt for the super deluxe instead.  I take down 1 star on the food rating due to its sodium level.

Someone ordered a pizza of regular crust.  I tell you that the regular crust is rather filling.  2 slices can be a meal to most.

We enjoyed the companionship immensely, but the long wait time dampened the experience.  It took over 40 minutes for the food to arrive.  During the wait, we had 1 refill of our drinks already.  We wondered out loud what had happened to our orders."}
{"text":"Would rate higher....but the last few visits the wait times have been awful and the service has been borderline dreadful. Attitude with a capital A.

This was a favourite go to place for good, platefuls of decent italian food. Surprising, I've never had one of their pizzas...we usually go the pasta route...but they look delicious when you walk to your table and see them being consumed by others. I thought they were on the pricey side...but to each their own.

The eggplant parmesan main course is gigantic and tasteful. I order the spicy sausage and pasta plate....fantastic. Please bring back the lemon chicken...it was my favourite dish and it's been taken off the menu.

I have noticed comments pertaining to prices going up while portion size is going down....I have noticed this as well. Regardless, you will not leave hungry......if anyone can finish their meal.....then they should enter contests.

Biggest complaint is irregular service and food prep times. On numerous occasions we've been told ( upon arrival) that the wait for food to come out of the kitchen is close to 60 minutes. We've been old this at least 4 times. You think that they would know busy days and be prepared....it is very off putting but at least they are telling you in advance and you can decide if you want to dine there or not.

Because past experiences have been so good, we keep going back hoping it'll get better...although when trying to pick a restaurant to go to and Dante's name came up....our group decided to eat elsewhere. Not a good sign."}
{"text":"Whoa, they go cray on the toppings on their pizzas, but thats a good thing!
It wasn't the best vegetarian pizza of my life, but it did the job.
I also got their smoked cheese ravioli....the flavour didn't work..it just tasted wrong.
Delivery was expensive, probably will opt for a local pizzeria next time."}
{"text":"*** Note: This is a factually accurate review that was posted on Nov 6, 2015, about the previous night. SOMEHOW the post was deleted despite Yelp's claim that restaurants/businesses cannot pay to have bad reviews of their services removed. This is a re-post. The people have a right to know. ***

Tonight's story is about waiting three hours for nothing.

I wish there was a way to give this place 0 stars. I literally have NEVER written a review in my life, but these guys are so terrible I had to sign up for a Yelp account JUST to warn everyone what a bunch of assholes they are.

We ordered at 7pm (from Leslie and Finch, barely a stone's throw from these guys, and we nearly found out for ourselves because this whole fiasco actually got us mad enough to throw stones at these guys), and were told it would be an hour and a half wait. At 8 45pm, we called again, saying that no one had showed up yet and were told that \"they only have one driver and there are a lot of accidents on the highways (none of which have to be taken to get from them to us, by the way), and that the pizza was made and just awaiting pick-up (wait, so it's just sitting there getting cold??), and that it shouldn't be more than half an hour from now (which would make it a grand total of 2 hours to get a pizza made and driven 20 minutes away). They then offered us a measly 15% on our NEXT pizza - thanks, but good customer service would have been to give us a discount on THIS pizza along with an apology, not some hypothetical pizza I'm certainly never going to be ordering from these jokers again.

At 9 30pm, 15 minutes past the \"half an hour from now\" mark, we call back. The phones ring and ring, and it goes to answering machine. We are completely mystified as to how this could happen, seeing as how our pizza hadn't arrived yet (like, what if it had just got here and some of our order was missing? Who would we talk to?). So we re-dial - much to our dismay, in the middle of the 5th ring, we get the robotized message \"the phone service has been disconnected.\" Clearly, they saw that we were calling to ask for an update on our DINNER at 9 30pm (far from unreasonable, in my opinion, when it was ordered at 7pm) and felt it was in their best interest to just shut off the line rather than answer the call and tell us more lies.

At 10pm we gave up and went to Pizza Nova to settle for far inferior pizza, but at least THEY didn't forget our damn order. As we were walking back at around 10 20pm, we saw their delivery driver parked in front of the house. Needless to say, we ignored him and walked right into the house, hoping that he saw our Pizza Nova boxes and would therefore know better than to expect payment for the shitty service he rendered.

If you're looking to get awesome gourmet pizza, PAOLETTI'S IS THE PLACE TO GO -- they are the family behind Dante's former greatness. Don't ever order from Dante's again unless you want your entire evening spent hungry and waiting to no avail.

What an unbridled load of horse shit."}
{"text":"The bloom is officially off the rose.  I was a regular at this place back in Thornhill when apparently the owners (and staff) gave a sh&t.  I'm giving it one star mainly because of my history with the place...otherwise it would be 0.

The reduced menu, without their signature Italian Sausage is like opening an ice cream store and forgetting Vanilla.  It's also on a laminated placard, which really screams class.

The service has horrendous.  Wait staff had too many tables (partially not their fault) and were inexperienced at taking care of people in a restaurant environment.  

The food was just ok...really nothing special.  And that was the biggest disappointment as I would have considered more stars if the food delivered as it used to.  

Reading the comments below it's clear this place is under new (and less engaged) management.  What a shame for a place that used to deliver so much for a reasonable price.

Bums me out..."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick business lunch.  

The pasta was great, service fast / friendly and no problems getting parked.  What can you say, all the markings of a solid place for a no hassle lunch."}
{"text":"This place is done. 
Nothing but bland pasta and tick pizza. 
Was an amazing place. 
The only thing that they had going for them is the large portions. 
Otherwise find a real Italian restaurant in the area.
I won't be back."}
{"text":"I also regret not taking pictures of said ripe tomatoes which I showed the shift manager.  Red and White and chewy, no flavour.  The manager had achance to right the shop but was rude and insulting.  Appearantely I had never had a kalamata olive before..Next time I'll save e $50 and get an authentic Italian sub from Subway for $5 .. Has anyone tasted their olives? Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, both in the eat in and take away formats. Crust is crispy, sauce zesty and toppings abundant. Probably one of the most expensive pizzas around, but worth it for a class well above the chains and still reasonable for dinner.

Lost a bit of its original charm and food went downhill when it moved from the original Richmond Hill location, but has since more than recovered and has become more comfortable within its new, more upscale space.

Service is warm, friendly and frequently with a sense of humour, just like the owner who can frequently be found at the take-out counter beside the entrance. Pasta and entrees are also good and portion sizes massive as the menu hints, but regulars come for the pizza.

The place can get loud at times with a poorly laid-out dining room, with service slow to a halt when busy (although not for take-out) and lengthy line-ups at peak times."}
{"text":"Three colleagues and I had lunch at Danta's Pizza today.

All four of us ordered sandwiches.  I ordered a meatball sandwich with cheese and roasted red peppers.  It was delicious!  The bun was crusty on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.  I tried to pick it up to eat it but there was just too much stuff inside ... so we ended up eating them with forks and knives.  I hadn't had breakfast and was hungry and ate it all ... it was filling!"}
{"text":"i think i should relocate to vaughan & order takeout from dante's everyday !!! just love it (ordered a mini for 3 sundried tomatoes, portobello mushroom, roasted chicken) & hot chocolate (forgot to tell them no cream on top but took it out  - could be a little warmer but really good!). cannot wait to come here again soon ^^"}
{"text":"For faith 
I will say Dantes had the best there was
And the new dining room is great for gatherings or parties 
I have faith  they will live up to their reputation and learn from changes that don't work 
Peoples taste buds are a serious business !
Best wishes"}
{"text":"Dante's, you've changed man! I have been eating at Dante's since their original location on Baythorn in Thornhill. As a young(er) guy, I remember my grandfather bringing over stacks of their coupons with no expiry date for my dad. Back then, the food was cheaper and the portions were HUGE. My family used to order from there on a weekly basis so I had the opportunity to sample their whole menu from pizza to sandwiches, veal parmesan, and my favourite, the pastas. Dante's moved to their current location several years back and along with the new location came some unfortunate changes. The prices for the food were raised, portion sizes reduced, and the coupons we had saved for years were no longer accepted. 

One thing Dante's has always done right is their toppings have always been excellent quality. They only use Schneider's pepperoni (the smaller sized ones) and this adds such a great taste to the pizza that I don't mind paying the premium price for it. They also go a great steak topping which is tender, moist, yet not fatty at all. My personal favourite is their pasta which is homemade. The meat raviolis are small but pack great taste and texture. Combined with their tomato sauce it's a match made in heaven. The sauce they use for the pastas is incredible and is available to buy at the take-out counter. Dante's also is well known for their sandwiches. They're big and are available with veal, meatball, sausage, italian cold cut, or veggies. If you like a salad accompaniment with your meal, I suggest the Chef's Salad which consists of lettuce, tomatoes, and olives along with a homemade oil/vinegar dressing. It's simple but very tasty. 

The food at Dante's is very good, I cannot deny that, however I find the prices they charge to be very high considering the portions you receive. At one point, I remember the pasta being only about $12-13 and serving 2 people easily. Today, the single serving is that price. The pizzas have also increased and a large pizza (enough for 2-3 people) will run you over $25 with a few toppings. Combine this with a salad and you'll be looking at a bill of easily $40 for 2 people (within drinks/dessert). Not terrible, but for a pizza place that's a bit high in my opinion."}
{"text":"As old-school Italian as this city gets, Dante's is one of the city's great unchained pizza shacks. 

Apparently they sell soup. Skip it in favour of a gigantic Caesar salad that balances sweet romaine hearts with homemade croutons, garlicky dressing and technically wrong but oh-so-right bacon. Or, if you want something a bit lighter *giggle*, try what we call the 'antipasto salad' of iceberg lettuce, tomato, a few other veggies and loads of provolone and salami goodness. Thankfully, it comes with a light vinaigrette...because, you know, you have to watch what you eat. 

Dante's offers huge pizzas with an avalanche of  quality toppings. Pepperoni is the best this city has outside of Paisano's; dime-sizes bites of crispy upturned sausage hold the oven's heat alongside an enchanted forest of lightly charred mushrooms. Sausage is pleasant but is really an afterthought compared to the pepperoni. Generosity is a bit of a drawback when it comes to brutally huge chunks of bitter green pepper. Light cheese, exceptionally bright tomato sauce which finds its way onto just about every menu item, and a sturdy crust mean that you can actually order down a size, and still fill your party's tummies. 

Pastas are similarly portioned, but unexciting except for that fabulous red sauce. Ravioli is the best of the lot. Lasagna is woefully uneven. Some nights, it's well-composed and seasoned; other nights it's a mess of random pasta shards and tough hunks of ground veal. I suspect that in those cases, they sell out of the real stuff and rush to prepare something that can be scraped onto a plate using what's around, hidden under a conspiratorial blanket of melted cheese. 

Once the cornerstone of the Bayview-John neighbourhood, Dante's has moved into posh Vaughan digs. It's a much better experience if you don't mind the drive, but it's hurt already hit-and-miss delivery. 

Coffee is decent, desserts sit forlorn, since nobody's got room. If only they were made from that pepperoni."}
{"text":"Having been to Dante's several times now, I know that this is a place to come to when you want a salty and very filling pizza experience. The pizza's here may not be gourmet or \"authentic\" Italian-style pizza's -  what they are, are heavy, toppings-riddled, and tasty American-style pizza's that will leave you feeling full and satisfied. Even Dante's \"thin crust\" pizza is not very thin at all!

The Meat-Lovers and Super Deluxe pizza's here have a special place in my heart, but the service the most recent time I came here, was  disappointing. Our party had to wait nearly an hour to receive our food. When asked for an update, the waitress claimed that the kitchen was backed up with orders (despite their being only one or two other filled tables in the restaurant at the time). On prior occasions, the wait-times for the food to arrive have also been quite long - rating drops because of this.

SUMMARY:

Good place to check out if you wish to be full of salty, artery-clogging goodness. Just make sure you have plenty of time to wait around for the sluggish/inattentive service."}
{"text":"Sung to the tune of \"Peppers and roasted mushrooms with no substitutes\".

FULL DISCLOSURE: (1) This review is based our experience last summer - (exactly 364 days prior to today Aug 18/2014) when it had the new and current menu; and (2) this rating does *NOT* necessarily reflect the pizza quality which, in the past, has been stellar.

For decades we went to their location in Thornhill south of Hwy 7/404 along Yonge.  Then they moved and we have only picked up a pizza once a couple of years ago - just not convenient.  Their pizza has always been expensive but you do get your money's worth (as they say).  Extremely filling and you would always get the best of toppings.  Where we could easily eat 1/2 or more of a Pizza Nova party size with 5 toppings - with barely enough for another meal, with Dante's the pizza (party/5 toppings) could easily last 3 or 4 full meals.  The cadillac of pizzas IMO.

**Preamble 
For a number of years we have been going to their new Bathurst (South of Rutherford) location every so often for their \"Giant Italian Sandwiches\" - mostly the steak and chicken and once the veal - they were fantastic.  

**This visit
We visited the location for my son's birthday, his choice, and discovered changes in the air overall - but most importantly the menu.

They have gone from providing an excellent sandwich - with what you want - a big one with lots of meat and the toppings of your choice, to one that is probably 3/4s - 4/5ths the size with fixed toppings and fries (how original).  The toppings is where we had a major issue and why I am posting this late review.  I had proof in the home but couldn't find the original menu - 99.9% of me remembered choosing the toppings but I couldn't force myself to post something without 100% confidence.  So skewer me!  (But yes I found it).

OLD MENU:
Veal/Steak were $12.49 and Chicken was 11.99
\"Served with ***YOUR*** choice of TWO toppings\".
My son would choose - mozzarella and onions; wife would choose mozzarella and green peppers

NEW MENU:
Veal/Steak/Chicken $14.99 with Insalata Dante (?) or Fries (or another subt +$2.69)
Steak \"Panini\" - comes with \"peppers and roasted mushrooms\"
Chicken - Roasted mushrooms and mozzarella/Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.
Don't like those toppings?  Sure you can pay the same amount and have them \"not\" put the toppings stated on but - \"so sorry - NO SUBSTITUTIONS\" (and my wife/son *HATE* mushrooms).
For the steak ... onions +$1.95 Mozzarella +$3.45 ... or $20.39 for something that cost $12.49 before (and was bigger).  Love the fries. (how original - NOT).  They couldn't justify $14.99 with a smaller sandwich so they had to add the fries.

That was enough for my wife to give this place a 1 star and never to return.  Meanwhile - what about me?  Huh?  Well I chose not to get a sandwich that night and ended up with shrimp linguine.

NEW MENU:
Black tiger shrimp pan seared, tossed with linguine and Dante's authentic tomato sauce.

For the first time in my life I said to the waitress to tell the chef \"I could do better myself\".   (!!)   What?  Me a chef?  No.  But it doesn't take a rocket scientist or someone like me who could burn water, to OVERCOOK SHRIMP SO THAT THEY ARE AS HARD AS ROCK.  I've done that.  Who hasn't?  But not for the then price of $15.99.  The sauce was also nothing to write home about - authentic?  Classico tastes better.  The waitress asked if I wanted something else, when I complained, but I choose to keep it and suffer.  In hindsight (20/20) I should have flipped it out for something else like a crappy reinvented high priced low value steak panini with \"roasted mushrooms\".  Yummy.

This is why I gave this restaurant a big 1 star.

Decor was nice and bathrooms clean.  (I never saw a change in these areas between old and new menu; I suspect that is how the Bathurst location opened).  The waitress, this visit, was so/so - always somewhere in a not so busy restaurant that evening.  Whatever.

I won't go into the details of the bread was changed or the removal of the other things they brought out.  From what I have read (per the reviews and lowered ratings) there appears to be a shift in management - which is a big shame.  Smells like a Kitchen Nightmare episode where the new owners somehow don't know why the restaurant has lost it's lustre.  

We haven't been back since (never will) and probably won't be getting a pizza again there either.  So sad.  \"Peppers and Roasted mushrooms with no substitutes\" indeed.

Ciao"}
{"text":"This was once my go-to place for authentic Italian food. However, I visited since the original owners left...and sadly it will be my last visit. 

The food was oily, had no flavour, and was worse than frozen food but twice the price.the eggplant \"rolls\" were
Oily, tasteless, and overpriced for the small portion. 

Meatballs were like rubber, cold on the outside but steaming hot inside - seemingly microwaved. 

Lasagna was a large portion, and again the same oil soaked sauce they used on everything else. And it tasted like it came from a can. 

We were sick the rest of the night, and will never eat here again. Not even if the food was free!

*Our server was very nice, and apologetic about the food that even she agreed was 'not as it once was' her words."}
{"text":"A clean large dining room with lots of seating and quick service.

The kitchen was clean and the bread was soft and fresh. A good start.

My chef salad was plain, yet big enough for two.

My lunch special was saucy, steaming hot and good to average for ravioli, however in unsure if they are actually made in house because they weren't super soft."}
{"text":"Now I am scare of anything call Mini. Can a mini really be a mini... not like a freaking Medium with ingredients loaded up like an Extra Large?

Seriously, Dante should have another option call Ultra Mini or Mini Mini and charge a little less... Why, I really want to eat some appetitizer, try some pasta and eat my freaking dessert! Or what if I want to drop by and pig out myself... I going to eat the whole pizza till I threw up?! :)

However, I have to say this is the BEST whole wheat crust pizza I ever have anywhere!! If all whole wheat crust tastes like that.. there will be no need for the regular dough and everyone will be eating a lot healthier.

I love the toppings! All those Feta cheese, fresh tomatoes! Yes all veggie pizza should taste like that and more people will eat that over all those processed meat pizza.

I would definitely stick with pizza next time when I come here and leave room for some dessert AND a Martini! Martini here is $5.95! This is what I call a good deal!

BTW, they do have Lunch Specials!!

They accepts all credit cards!"}
{"text":"The very best pizza ever!!!  Huge pizzas filled with huge slices of meat & vegetables and with flavours and texture so fresh and delectable.  Classy and very cozy restaurant with a casual flare.  Been perfect for my family and friends for dinner feasts.

Its Super Deluxe and/or Meat Lover's for us always.  One time, my husband couldn't help himself he wanted extra sausage toppings on the Super Deluxe and it was soooo good.  The Chicken Wings is one of our faves, and its buffalo sauce being slightly sweet and not too hot is quite good and perhaps a signature. Likewise, the honey garlic sauce is pretty amazing.  

Such great Italian place.  A bit overwhelming menu but enough to make us anticipate our next visit/delivery.  Dine-in or take-out, we're equally happy!  And its one of my personal landmarks for great food and dining.  Indeed \"Quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten...\""}
{"text":"Always order delivery and its always convinent. Wait time is about an hr though which sux. Food wise always been impressed. One of yhe tastiest veal sandwiches. But i gitta sat its Yummy but pricey."}
{"text":"If all you care about is huge portions, this is your place...if you are like me, and want great food and service....don't bother!
Our pizza had no taste and I'm sure they used crappy cheese.  The worst part was that part of the crust was burnt.  After eating the part that wasn't burnt we called the waitress over to show her. She picked up part of the pizza (with her hands), didn't say much, and we asked to speak to the manager.  He came over and we told him that about 1/2 of the crust was burnt, and he said emphatically, \"That's Impossible!\".  Then he lifted up part and then said, \"I can't do anything because you ate part of the pizza\".  He said \"You will have to take it\".  Umm...I don't think so, considering both he and the waitress had already manhandled it!!  Gross!  I asked again if he was in fact the manager... turns out his daughter is really the manager.  She agreed to charge us only 1/2, as that's all we could eat.  On the way out, we see the \"Manager\" outside, and he asks us if everything was ok.  Then the most hilarious part is that he said \"Oh, well, sometimes that (the burnt pizza) happens\"....Funny, 20 minutes earlier when we told him about the burnt crust, his words were  \"THAT\"S IMPOSSIBLE!\"
Needless to say, we will not be returning...ever

I thought I was done with my review, however, in the middle of the night, we all woke up with stomach aches..and ...well...you know what !!  ugh! ugh! ugh!"}
{"text":"Where do I Start.  First I'll say something nice. The waitress was sweet. Now about the food. Mushy cold rice balls served with tomato paste sauce and peas. Yum.... NOT. When the waitress asked how they were I told her the truth. Over cooked gnocchi store bought. The kind in an air tight package. They taste sour from the preservatives. When I go out for gnocchi I expect fresh made not grocery store quality.  The pizza was sized generously  in name but priced for its physical size.  Don't order  prosciutto or salami on your pizza. They tasted old and the prosciutto wasn't recognizable. Thank god we ordered thin because it was pretty thick. All in all it was horrible. I ended upsetting sick and my son did too. I wish I could get my money back. Sore and Sad"}
{"text":"Good service, waitress was friendly and efficient.
Pizza however, tasted like a pre made supermarket pizza. Even the caesar salad tasted like salad from a bag. Not very authentic, fresh or flavourful. Better off going to Longos."}
{"text":"Had the pizza here today. The crust was soft and gooey. The pizza was quite oiled and the sauce had zero appeal it was a step above ketchup. Sorry but I can not recommend this place. It used to be so good years ago  what happen?"}
{"text":"TLDR version: I have to say the service is good at the restaurant.  However, I don't see the specialty of it, I think I have comparable gastronomic experience at Pizza Hut (@Don Mills & Finch only)

The place is classy that's for sure and the service was above par.  We ordered a pizza which is a close equivalent to when I normally would do at other places that supported create-your-own.  1/2 Ground beef (in this case ground veal), pineapple, mushroom and 1/2 anchovies (for my wife).

The anchovies were pretty good in that they were not excessively salty which we all liked.  The veal was a bit meh-ish which was a bit of a disappointment.  The crust wasn't anything to write home about (in fact I think I prefer the *original* Pizza Hut pan pizza crust).  The crust is just all carbs that expand to fill you up so a medium was pretty heavy to be shared among 5 people.  Next time get a small.

The other thing I tried was the ravioli.  The sauce of the bloody thing was sour as heck.

The price was a bit high for what I have tasted as well.  So much so that I had to split the bill because it was just too heavy a load to treat people at $17 per person.

I do feel a bit bad with the three-star rating, especially with the service and atmosphere.  But the price and quality expectation just wasn't there for me."}
