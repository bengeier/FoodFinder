{"text":"My favorite place for Bánh mì! This little cafe is easy but shameful to miss on Broadview Avenue.  I always get the Chay version, which is a kind of tofu slaw with carrots and mushrooms, topped with cilantro and cucumber.  You'll be asked if you want spicy, and just so you know, there is no 'little bit spicy'.  If you choose spicy, you're going all the way, and I suggest you do.  

The ladies that run and work the place are also very sweet and friendly; they started to recognize me after just two visits and my order is practically ready by the time I hit the counter.  There is not much seating available but I have always taken my sandwich(es) to go.  They've recently raised the price from $1.75 to $2 and I still feel like I'm ripping them off!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and needed a quick bite but didn't know where to go, thankfully Yelp saved the day! The only thing I MUST mention is that the actual location is 601 Gerrard not 324 Broadview. They must have changed locations.. because I was looking all over Broadview for this place and didn't find it until I decided to give up and find a new place to eat (which just so happen to lead me along Gerrard).

I got the bbq pork bahn mi which really was some sort of sausage looking thing, It was pretty decent and the bread was very fresh. I wish there was more signage of what the random food items along the counter were because I am not well versed in Viet food.

Overall a quick, cheap, and decent place. Next time I go, I would like to try something else."}
{"text":"Rose's Vietnamese Sandwiches are now on 601 Gerrard East, so don't go looking for it on Broadview. 
The bánh mì sandwiches are definitely very tasty and cheap but be forewarned - there's no seating.  The nice lady behind the counter called me a \"darling\" a few times and packed the sandwich in a plastic bag, it kept for a few hours, no problem. 

I love paying 50 cents more and getting something \"deluxe\"!"}
{"text":"Rose cafe is a teeny Vietnamese Cafe on Broadview (in the *other* Chinatown) That has the best Bánh mì in the city.  In university, we used to refer to these as \"Saigon Buns.\" Back then, on Spadina you could get them for a $1 a piece, and many a times younger me + crew would be seen on a stoop in Kensington polishing off an entire bag. 

Bánh mì is a baguette with coldcuts, pate or tofu. It is garnished with pickled carrots and diakon radish, cilantro, cucumber and spicy chilis. These sandwiches are the product of French rule in Vietnam. 

Rose Cafe makes them best though. The bagettes are fresh, the tofu mix is GREAT, and they are super cheap. Two meat sandwiches and One tofu sandwich sets you back $5.50 after tax. And they don't skimp out on the toppings. Add some Sriracha for some extra kick, and walk north to Riverdale Park for a picnic. You won't regret that view. 

Note they sometimes close early. Weeknights I have visited as late as 7pm, Weekends I have gone at 7 and they are closed. Minimal English is spoken but enough to get by. Typical Vietnamese Cafe treats and ridiculously large selection of beverages. 

Note if you are getting the Vegetarian, you may want to ask for no butter."}
{"text":"Rose Cafe is the reason why I have never even stepped foot into a \"Banh Mi Boys\" establishment - whenever I feel like having a Banh Mi, I always find myself gravitating towards this place, regardless of how great of a detour I must take to walk through these doors. 

What can I say that hasn't been said before? The Banh Mi here are fresh, good on the go (which you will inevitably do so since the eating area within is borderline nonexistent) and satisfying. The various pickled vegetables are tart with a bit of sweetness to it. The loads of cilantro and other herbs provide a freshness to counterbalance the heat from the chili, salt from the meat and pickle from the veggies. 

And then there's the liver pate. THAT PATE!!! I don't even like to eat liver but I want them to jar it up and sell it in supermarkets. Or at least in store. Or online. Just let me have access to that delicious, addictive stuff!

I usually either order the Deluxe ($2.50) - various assorted indistinguishable but oh so tasty meats or Chay ($2.00) - Marinated cubes of fried tofu that are served cooled and pop with flavor when bit into. These bad boys put Subway to shame in terms of taste, price and most likely healthiness as well.

Make sure to have the kind lady behind the counter hold back on the chili if you have a sensitivity to heat - they're aggressive, bold and at times can be overpowering to the sandwich itself if you bite into a particularly concentrated area of chili. I personally ask for a bit less, even though my tolerance for heat is nonexistent, I feel like there is something missing without it.

If I remember correctly, I once read in a newspaper about how the store owners do not make much money off of the sale of each sandwich, but they do not want to increase the price because they get by just fine and that they wouldn't want to disappoint any customers. With such kind and friendly service, and an amazingly simple but cheap and delicious meal - save for leaving town and setting up shop at another city, I cannot fathom how anybody could be disappointed with this place!

Easiest 5/5 I've given, and for good reason."}
{"text":"Probably the best and freshest traditional banh mi in Toronto.  I usually get 4 subs extra spicy.  I eat two and save two.  They wrap and seal the subs in plastic which keeps them fresh."}
{"text":"...great place for vietnamese sandwiches - the owner of the store is quite friendly and mixes in some of her own language when she speaks to you in english - i had to keep filling in the blanks and figure out what she was saying!  

a deluxe sandwich which comes with every type of meat is only $2.50 - seriously, only $2.50.  desserts are around $1 to $3 - i've tried a few and they were all pretty good.  the little shop is stacked with lots of goodies so make sure you take a good look around before paying for everything!"}
{"text":"Now, I love me a solid sandwich.  Even more so, if it's accessible, full of coriander, and pickled daikon, and contains a mystery element.  I like to live on the edge, you see.  However, I don't see for the life of me how something so tasty only costs me a mere $2.50.  Like, seriously?  $2.50.  Yet, Rose's Cafe still does it, time after time.   Maybe the rest of retail fast food is wrong, and this tradition of banh mi, so very right?  Something to contemplate.  In fact, you can do so while enjoying a delicious lunch from Rose's."}
{"text":"$2 for an excellent sandwich. Seriously it's only $2."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place because it reminds me back in the day when my mom used to take be grocery shopping in Chinatown (east side).  We used to always get Banh Mi at a store like this and pick up random desserts or snacks for SOOO CHAEP.

Banh Mi for $2...get 2 and there is your lunch and some."}
{"text":"Recently re-opened on Gerrard street.

The Bánh mì is always consistently good here, coming in a selection of different cold cuts, sausages (nem nuong), and tofu priced at $2 for regular size and $2.50 for a deluxe bun. Garnished with pickled carrots, daikon radish, cilantro, and peppers (optional). 

Rose Cafe also offers a variety of Vietnamese desserts, from packaged banana cakes, pastries and sweet soup all for a very affordable price. 

They also sell Vietnamese sausages and ham separately and spring rolls hot from the kitchen.

Always a great choice for a quick and easy lunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I'd never had Banh Mi before, but given it's cheapness & the enthusiasm of the reviewers here on Yelp, I thought I'd walk over this afternoon and give it a try.  

Even on a Sunday afternoon, there was a steady stream of customers going in and out, and I ordered the assorted meat sandwich, spicy.  They got it to me almost right away, and with a pop my total came to $3.

I was a little nervous, because my opinion of coldcuts is pretty low at the best of times (why did I order that one? Choice paralysis; I didn't know what to get, so I picked the first thing on the menu. I'll admit that it's an imperfect system).  

Once I spotted the meatballs, I kinda wished i'd gone with them.  But when I tasted the Bahn Mi I'd bought, I had no regrets.  So many delicious things on one sandwich! I'm a big fan of cilantro, and the spiciness was pretty perfect.  

Friendly, fast, delicious, and crazy-cheap; there's nothing about this place that isn't great.
Next time, I'm going to try some of the puddingy-looking things in the cold case, too.  And try the tofu, and the meatballs."}
{"text":"Rose Cafe's Banh mi taste so GOOD!! Why? 

The baguette is one of the reason. Even packed in a plastic bag for 3 hours before I ate that, it tasted still so fresh, crispy outside soft and bouncy inside... hmmm carbs carbs!!

BBQ pork made fresh to order! Nice and friendly lady making my sandwich! Priced cheaply at $2 (tax in!)!!

There are also tons of vietnamese desserts and other goodness.....

What a nice and cute charming Vietnamese cafe! :P"}
{"text":"Best banh mi I've had in Toronto so far ~ !
The bread they use is fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.


They have a whole bunch including grilled pork, shredded chicken, and regular. The Special has 4 different types of meats inside and their pate is properly smooth and tasty. The Veggie Tofu is my favourite one - it's basically julienned carrots and mushrooms and fried tofu chunks. They add squirts of soy/maggi sauce after putting it together, but I found it quite salty the first time and it made parts of the bread soggy. Funny thing is she wouldn't let me NOT have any sauce on it, telling me it wouldn't taste good without it! I asked for just a little bit then and she obliged :) 

Seriously, for $2.50 you just can't beat this for a meal!!
I've only been there twice now, but I'll definitely go back to try out their other Viet dishes and dessert drinks."}
