{"text":"I was happy to find out that a new HK style cafe opened in this area - always on the lookout for more options! 

We came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The breakfast menu is fairly small, with a few noodle options, macaroni, sandwiches, and oddly enough (for an HK style cafe), pancakes and waffles. A drink is included with each breakfast item. 

We ordered: 
- Satay beef vermicelli with ham omelette: A little bland and could have used some more satay sauce. The omelette had shredded ham inside. 
- Instant noodle with two eggs and two sausages: Tasted as expected... not much to say here!
- Milk tea: Too milky, not enough tea taste. 

Our meals also came with two buns (warmed up by microwave) with a side of butter. 

Overall, everything was average at best. One thing that's good about this restaurant is that they open at 7:30am every morning, so if you're looking for an early breakfast location, this is a good candidate (provided that you're okay with the limited menu options). I'll give it another shot by coming back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The place is bit hidden from Yonge Street. Great food and service for Breakfast. Will definitely be back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is the best HK style restaurant around this area. The price is reasonable and they have good variety of choices. You have to try their HK milk tea. So delicious!! I'm glad that this restaurant is close to my house."}
{"text":"Pretty decent HK style cafe in the area. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly. They offer free delivery service if you order more than $30 before tax. We ordered a couple of things for dinner and they all came in very good portion. The pork chop was well cut, not just fat that you'll find in most places. They also give out free dessert. Will come back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a new HK Style cafe to try, as we always are. We came across this one on Yelp. It was close to where we were so we decided to try out the restaurant. The interior was nice and new, alot of sunlight was beaming in as well. We ordered the Curry Fish fliet with fish and this tofu dish, which came with soup and a drink. While my boyfriend was finishing his soup, he found a METAL string from those scrubs they use to clean pots and pans, the waitress was standing right there, all she did was say \"i'm sorry\", took it and i heard nothing else. You would think they would either say the meal is on them or give us a discount, NOTHING, NADA. I was so upset, I had to ask for a discount, then is when she said I will talk to my boss and ask, we were given 10%off.  Is was right then and there, that we said we will NEVER COME BACK! They do not understand customer service, would it kill for them to just say they wont charge for that meal combo which only cost like $9? Instead they've lost two customers and potential more because we would be telling our friends and family not to go there. Had they given the free meal, I may have considered coming back because I love a restaurant who understand that great customer service goes a long way.

Summary of the food (1 out of 5):
HK Milk tea (cold): no tea taste and watered down
Soup: The borsch soup was actually tasty, the other chinese soup was bland
Curry Fish with Rice: the curry was similar to other restaurants, rice was hard, and the fish was just fish, nothing special about this dish, I've had better
Tofu Dish: Was not spicy and bland, also better elsewhere 

When we asked for the bill, they forgot to apply the 10% discount, we had to remind them to reprint the bill."}
{"text":"Apron café is a HK style café tucked away in the neighbour plaza to the Richmond Hill T&T on Yonge street. At first glance, the café has a rustic look that gives you the quaint-look impression. 

The main highlight of the experience was the service of by the wait staff. They frequently stopped by our table to check on us, filling up our tea glasses before they got too empty and were prompt with whatever we needed. The staff were patient when we needed clarification on any items on the menu. 

We ordered three dishes to share during our visit; the seafood casserole, mixed grill platter and the Malaysian curry chicken. The side salad that came with the meal are just a couple of slices of iceberg lettuce with thousand island dressing on top. For soups, we had a choice of borscht and traditional Chinese soup. 

Besides the drink, the side dishes are nothing to write home about so don't worry about missing out if you plan on ordering a meal outside of their special combo."}
{"text":"This place is open at 7am. Thats amazing for the area. Free chinese newspaper in the morning when you sit down. The breakfast meal comes with drinks for about $6.50. great value and service."}
{"text":"A standard HK-style cafe with nice interior and good service. If you're in the area and needing a fix for HK-style cafe food, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"There's only a few go-to places for HK Cafe style food that I usually go to if I'm craving some baked rice casseroles. 

I ordered the Kung Pao chicken, malaysian beef brisket curry and black pepper beef rice. Flavor-wise, the dishes were a step above other standard HK restaurants like Richmond Court, Blue Ocean Cafe etc. Normally I find flavoring for HK dishes to be a bit on the blander side, I guess because of the western influence. But there was a good burst of flavors in all 3 dishes. Plus the dishes came with soup and dessert (tong sui). 

The dishes also came out lightning fast, and the owner (I think) of the restaurant seemed friendly and caring when I asked what kind of curry they used to make the Malaysian curry. 

Just a few things that could have elevated the experience was the portion sizes. Especially for the black bean beef rice, which seemed smaller than other HK places. Also, although the flavors were good, I have definitly had more memorable and tastier versions of all 3 dishes at other chinese restaurants.

So I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I was in the area, then I would stop by."}
{"text":"there is no dessert here. talk about getting played. cafe?? more like restaurant. noodles tasted rather bland, soup was like yellow water, and the French toast was banger, yet flooded with butter. overall, simply disappointing.                The iced coffee was good. happy hour made my day thank you for free drinks"}
{"text":"I usually come here with my godmother and parents since they live come by this restaurant.  I particularly love the sweet and sour pork usually, it is always delicious with juicy pineapple and tender deep fried pork soaked into the mouth watering sweet tangy sauce.  Having said that, I was a little disappointed with the service yesterday.  The waitress gave us rice first when the main dishes were not ready and so the rice were left to sit cold.  And we didn't get our soup almost half way into dinner.  

The other servers were a little irratated about this, but I think they should educate her a little bit about the flow of how the food should go out.  Usually, we like to have the soup first, then some dishes and then white rice.  I thought this is common knowledge in a HK style cafe.  I usually am quite please to eat there since the decor is clean and spacious.  The food are always really good, non greasy, and no msg.  

If it was not the yesterday's mishap, I would have given a higher rating.  Hope they improve next time"}
{"text":"Was doing groceries at T&T when we noticed this little cafe tucked away in the corner facing Yonge street. Serving typical Hong Kong style cafe food the menu has plenty of selection but not overwhelming that makes it hard to decide. 

Ambiance - 4/5 Since it's newly open, the decor is new and clean. There are two big TV screens playing the news (not Chinese drama!)

Food - 3/5 average in presentation and taste. It was flavourful but lacks elements that differentiate it from other hk cafés. 

Service - 3.5/5 prompt service like many hk  cafés but I liked how the waitress asked me if I would like my drink at the beginning or end of my meal so extra .5 for that."}
{"text":"This place would've got a better review, but I guess I just went on a bad day. Food was pretty good, my family and I got the curry beef brisket ($8.99), house special boiled chicken ($10.99), and fried spicy pepper shrimp ($9.99). I found a big piece of plastic in my food, server spilled water all over me, and they had a shortage of house soup and rice... One of the dishes were comped and the servers helped clean up the mess so thank goodness for that. Not sure if I would come again, but if I do I hope this doesn't happen again cause the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and food was great.  Compared to other HK cafes, the food was clean and simple flavours.  Not salty at all.  Highly recommend for simple HK breakfast fare."}
{"text":"Where do i begin? So far, after giving this place a second chance for the service...complete FAIL! The servers were absolutely terrible and they pick and choose what kind of service to whom gets it. The worse thing was we didn't even get the chace to give a proper tip and the server just wanted to take all our chance! Forget that!! I don't think you did enough to earn a $9 tip!  The only thing they had good going for them ia the food is pretty good and the portions are just enough. FYI they only accept cash. No debit or credit. If you are expecting proper hospitality service don't expect much from this place."}
{"text":"Diners : 2 on Saturday morning brunch
Decor: decent
Food : good
Cons : waitress with extremely bad attitude, first meal came quickly, ate it, the second meal still didn't come. Asked the waitress where the second one was. She says just wait it's coming. Asked a second time, says I said its coming. Didn't apologize. Wanted to leave but because we got a course meal. Ended up  waiting 30 min for a dish and didn't even apologize. Best part is the restaurant wasn't even half full!!!  When we asked for the bill she slammed the bill down and said \"ding gor fai\" under her breath, not knowing we know chinese. Which means roughly f#ck u. 
Repeat? If u want bad service, maybe do take out instead if u were to try this place out....it's unfortunate as the Food is actually good."}
{"text":"Don't even bother coming here unless its for afternoon tea. First time I came here I would've awarded a 3 star. After coming here numerous times I think they deserve a 2.  Here's my rationale.

I've tried half of the items on the afternoon tea menu and found that the only thing they did right was the braised beef brisket rice noodle soup. Everything else was mediocre. The first time I had it, it was awesome with a generous amount of beef and a nice complement of veggies.  Each successive time I got it, the portion just seemed to get smaller and smaller. Don't get me wrong, it's still the best item on the menu, but depending on how the chef feels that day you might get more/less portion-wise.

Now the reason why I go for afternoon tea only is because they have a deal where you can add a dollar to your order to tack on either curry fish balls, spring rolls, spicy tofu, french fries OR garden salad. Here is where it gets interesting. The tofu is actually the hidden gem in all of this. It blew my mind how good this tofu was (its not spicy at all to be honest so idk why they call it 'spicy tofu') but it was so well-fried, crispy and flavorful. You get 6 pieces for one order. I think nowadays, whenever I'm thinking of going somewhere near my house for afternoon tea, I consider this place JUST because of the tofu seeing as the soup noodle is inconsistent most of the time. In fact, the tofu is so good its the only reason I'd consider giving a 3 star rating for this place.

Service is pretty meh. They just hired a new trainee (its an old guy who's hard of hearing) and he's just learning the ropes but friendly. The other waitress is pretty forgetful cuz she always seems to forget something whenever shes in charge of our order. 

Verdict: Come here for a cheap, afternoon tea meal - get the braised beef brisket noodle soup and ADD THE TOFU to your meal for $1. Get anything else and hear the virtual me saying \"I told you so\"."}
{"text":"I was trying to find the silver lining in my experience here, they're new, the warm buns were good, the service was friendly enough for a Chinese run establishment and that's all that went well for this place. 

The offer a HK style breakfast and Canadian style breakfast. I ordered a macaroni soup with  ham (very close to spam). I've had HK style macaroni soup before and this was much more bland and tasteless. They brought out the buns way too early and had no bread for my eggs when they came out. The sausages are hot dogs. The breakfast sandwiches are made with wonderbread (un-toasted). The coffee and milk tea had about half cup of evaporated milk in it. The $7 fruit salad claimed to have strawberries. It did not. It consisted of apple, sour blueberries, oranges and rotten cantaloupe. One of the people in my party refused to finish their meal. 

This was a brunch experience, I wasn't able to try the lunch or dinner options. But overall there was no value for the quality and price of the food."}
{"text":"Okay so the food is not \"wow\", and it's not particularly cheap either, but I like how clean and comfortable the cafe is. Friendly and attentive service which is rare at these kinds of cafes.

I ordered the hoinan chicken and they deboned it for you, which is always a plus for lazy people like me. The Fujian fried rice was alright but portion was big. The HK milk tea was pretty standard. 

They give out free Singtao Chinese newspapers. For afternoon tea (after 2:30pm) you can order a skewer of curry fish balls for $1 along with your meal. I haven't tried that yet but I'll prolly be back for it hehehe"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here today for a snack after spending the day at the library and WOW were we thoroughly unimpressed...

The good: 
The interior is really nice and its comfortable. There are lots of open seats.

The bad:
The so-called \"fruit salad. The fruit was great, sure, but definitely not worth $7, and the salad dressing made part of it basically inedible. Yuck, 1/5 for sure.

The chicken wings and fries combo was better. The fries lacked flavour, but there was salt and pepper at the side of the table. 2.5/5.

TLDR; this place is too pricey for the mediocre food it serves."}
{"text":"The service is going worse and worse, and the food also the same compared to at the beginning..the waitress are very moody..."}
{"text":"We didn't want to travel too far for lunch, so my wife suggested that we try the hk style cafe near the T&T supermarket at Yonge and Weldrick.

I think I just found the worst food to eat in Richmond Hill. I had the beef brisket rice noodle soup. My wife had the fish ball rice noodle soup. These are incredible simple dishes one can order at a hk style cafe restaurant, how can they mess that up so badly?! The brisket was so tough and tasteless, and rice noodle is so soggy and broken in little pieces so I can't eat it with a chopstick anymore. Portion is big, but I only have soggy noodle in my bowl.

I couldn't finish my bowl it's so bad. Neither can my wife. Usually when I am hungry I am not a picky eater, and I was starving, but I just can't take another bite.

{"text":"This place opened recently near where I live so I went there with my family to try it out since there aren't that many HK style cafes near us. 

Interior: I'd say nicer than regular HK style cafes with hardwood floors and tables. There's 2 TVs on each side of the restaurant, one playing Chinese and one on CP24. Seats were pretty comfortable as well with plenty of tables available. 

Service: One of the waitresses we had (a little older with short hair and glasses) seemed to be having a bad day. I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt since it's our first time there but she was very abrupt and didn't smile at all. Seemed impatient when taking our order and didn't give us chopsticks to eat the hoinan chicken with until we asked another waitress who was much more pleasant (we had forks but it's easier with chopsticks). 

Food: Everything was pretty average. Nothing outstanding but not bad either. 
- Hoinan chicken with rice ($8.99) came with a soup, had a good amount of chicken and the rice was done well. 
- Mixed meat grill ($14.99) came with soup, salad, dinner roll, and a drink. I shared this with my mom. The soup I got was corn and egg drop I think? It was pretty standard soup, nothing special. Roll came with butter and it was light and warm. The \"salad\" was only lettuce with some dressing on it lol. Now for the meat! It came with beef, chicken, pork, a sausage, piece of bacon, veggies and choice of rice, spaghetti, or fries. You can also choose ur own sauce like black pepper, gravy, onion, etc. We got the gravy with rice. It was a good portion, definitely a lot for 1 person but it wasn't enough to split between 2 hungry people. I think it could've used more gravy and the beef didn't have much taste so I had to eat it with the bacon to get some flavour. Chicken and pork were good though. For the drink we got the HK style milk tea and it was pretty good, not watered down which I was worried about since a couple other reviewers mentioned that. 

All in all I would probably come back again, maybe for the afternoon tea or to try the breakfast since they're so close."}
{"text":"I went in without seeing other reviews and found the service to be above average for what you typically expect for Hong Kong cafes. The servers were attentive and polite. Price was good for the portion. I had the dinner set for $13, came with baked pork chop spaghetti in tomato sauce, drink, small salad, soup, and Chinese dessert. Couldn't finish it. Taste was as expected. All in all, it's a solid choice for Chinese food in this neighbourhood.. Definitely better than the congee place across the street."}
{"text":"Pros:
Specials for all times of the day
Prices are fair

Cons:
Not much variety in the menu

Came here since we were grocery shopping at the nearby TnT supermarket. Apron is your standard HK style cafe.  It's not anything special, but it's not horrible either.  I look at some of the 1 star reviews here and think that the reviewers were expecting too much from a HK style cafe. 

Apron looks like it would be a very small place from the outside, but they do have a considerable amount of tables inside.  We came in during the beginning of afternoon tea time (2:30-5:30pm).  The place wasn't too busy, but after about 20 minutes, it was packed.  I will have to come back to see if it's this way during other parts of the day.

Looking at the menu, you see that they have specials for every part of the day.  There are breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner and all day specials.  No matter what time you come, there are specials to be had.  The bad part is, each section contains about 10-15 dishes only.  So you can only choose between the all day specials and the specials on during the time of day you're coming in.  Basically, you get to choose from about 30 items.  There's not too much variety this way.  They do have kids meals though, which was a nice surprise.

I ordered the Hainan chicken with rice and my GF had the pork cutlet and potato salad.  We ordered one of the kids meals for our little one as well.  The food comes out fairly quickly.  Like I said, this place is your standard HK style cafe.  The food reflects that.  It was not terrible, but not anything to write home about.  It was a very decent meal, which is what you expect.  Trying to expect anything premium will only lead you to disappointment.  My GF said the potato salad was on of the better ones she had at a HK style cafe. 

The service here is pretty good.  They get really busy during certain time but they still got around often enough that you were waiting long for anything. There was an elderly Caucasian couple sitting beside us.  I have never seen this demographic at a HK style cafe.  They started chatting with us and told us they loved this place and are regulars.  They both need help with mobility and they say the staff always help them out.  

If I'm shopping at the nearby TnT, i will for sure drop by for a meal.  It's a decent place to get a meal."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for weekend brunch & is quite satisfied with their food & service!!  Quite a huge selection of choices & combinations on the menu.  Weekend brunch comes with complimentary Chinese newspapers.  The decor is modern.  Very clean place!!  Definitely a returned customer!!"}
{"text":"Caution they are not friendly people!!! No service here. Props to one of the staff's son he is prob the nicest person in this restaurant. 

I second the guy who said they wouldn't allow them to have the afternoon special at 2.28 b/c their policy is at 2.30... 

I took an elder lady out for a late lunch. We were coming back from dt and wanted somewhere close to home so I suggest to her we try this one. It was family day so they only had us one table in the afternoon around 3 pm. My friend asked for 2 pieces of lemon to put in the tea but they have refused saying this is their policy. Geez like how much would the 2 slices of lemon cost you? 

We ordered beef brisket noodle soup and chicken fingers and potato salad. The soup was alright. (I have had it before it is about average of what you will expect in a HK cafe). The chicken fingers were so small and kinda dark on the crisp outside. They look terrible. The taste is just so so. I saw that the table beside us ordered chicken wings. For the same price trust me that one looked a lot better. 

I have had takeout in this restaurant before cuz it is fast and cheap. I have had dinner with a couple of my friends before here too. It was always an okay place to me whenever I feel lazy. But now I'm afraid of this bad experience I have taken it out of my list of food."}
{"text":"Finally tried it for the first time after passing by numerous times shopping at the nearby T&T.  Pleasantly surprised by the decent quality and above average food they make.  Soup was good and lunch was tasty, definitely be one of the place to grab lunch in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Apron Cafe is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. Located right at the plaza next to T&T Weldrick is quite convenient if you doing some Chinese grocery shopping in the area.

The interior is clean and spacious with 2 huge TV showing CP24 and Chinese variety programs respectively.

Menu is quite standard with breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and all day specials. Great for a cheap meal as most of the options are under $10 which includes soup, main and drink.

Portion size is quite good and the ingredients freshly and prepared with care. my Baked Spaghetti with Meat Sauce ($8.50) was a little bland but the borscht was loaded with vegetables!

Will definitely be back to try out other items. Afternoon tea starts at 2:30, great as a late lunch!

Service was exceptionally friendly and attentive. +0.5 star

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Second time here.  Not busy in the morning.  Inside is spacious and the seats are comfortable.  Decent food.  Free Chinese newspaper with breakfast.  The female boss even gave me an extra newspaper from yesterday. +0.5 stars"}
{"text":"It's a small Hongkong style coffee shop tucked next to Blinds store. Sign is not as visible if you're driving along Yonge street. Happened to discover this place by accident when Mr Congee was closed. And I'm glad I tried it. Just next to T & T. 

Three times visit and I enjoyed the food. Came here for lunch ordering the fish with corn sauce and chicken curry. Comes with buns with butter and Soup, hongkong tea, etc. Came back again for tea time. I liked pork chop soup with noodles and deep fried chicken wings with fries.  For extra $1, you can get curry balls. I will highly recommend this place."}
