{"text":"After 4 years, not much has changed for this little shop in the top corner of the NW but that isn't a bad thing: the prices and pizzas are still amazing, however their selection of specialty pizzas has grown to include a few more ethnic flavours. The Chicken Tandoori pizza remains the best pizza this place has to offer with the delicious bites of chicken tandoori dotted with jalapeños and cheese combining to a make spicy-savoury flavour that you will find yourself craving more and more of. New additions like the Punjabi style is sure to leave an impression on the desi person inside of you. If you're not Desi, you will gain a new love or hate relationship with Ginger. Overall, the pizzas remain their strong point and the sides remain a work in progress - try and avoid if possible (though their new fried chicken is rather good but pricey).

This strip in Pantella used to be barren but now boasts lots of vibrant shops and businesses, Pizza Cottage was one of the first and now it shines as one of the NW's brightest. The fact that they've been able to expand with 2 more locations in other parts of the city should really tell you something about the pies this place is dishing out.

If you're looking for a quality pizza and a good value, it may be time to rethink all that you knew about pizzas: forget the Huts, the blue and red game pieces, and the undersized emperors, when you want pizza think \"Cottage!\", Pizza Cottage that is."}
{"text":"Recently received a flyer for this company and decided to try their pick-up service, as they are close by. I get the impression they are fairly new at this as they forgot to ask my name on the phone, but that was the only major hiccup. The pizza was reasonably priced and of good quality. The outlet location was clean and serviceable. A nice change from the chain places; have been using Pizza Hut recently and the staff at the local restaurant usually seem disengaged and I've had to wait more than once despite being given specific pick-up times there."}
{"text":"Great new pizza place in Panorama.  We had the Hawaiian and the Chicken Tandoori.  They both had a great crust and excellent sauce, and in this rare instance we didn't order extra sauce and didn't have to.   They also didn't skimp on the cheese.  The Chicken Tandoori had just the right amount of kick too, with the jalapeño's as a great touch.  The prices were also really reasonable, very competitive with the delivery chains.  If you are thinking of Pizza Hut, Panagos, or Little Caesars think again and order Pizza Cottage - you won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"I tried their chicken tandoori pizza and loved every bite of it. Fresh flavors and delicious toppings. The pizza crust was a bit of a let down, but the toppings made up for it. Loved it. Will try again"}
{"text":"This probably is one place I think about if craving for halal pizza. I like the buffalo chicken , chicken tandoori and pepperoni pizza. Their service is also very good."}
{"text":"I went here and I asked for a pizza slice and the guy said he had no pizza slices and it looked to me like he didn't want to make any more pizza.like it looked like his oven was off and stuff. I won't recommend going here for pizza because the guy that works there doesn't want to sell you pizza at all."}
{"text":"The pizza is decent but everytime I go in there they try to over charge me and I have to correct them. It's a little fishy since as soon as I point it out they quickly agree that I was right. Also they always have signage saying they have a pick up special for a 2 topping pizza for $8.99 but when I call and ask about the special they say it's no longer valid even though when I drive by it is clearly advertised on the main road. Very frustrating and will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in airdrie period

Try it and you'll understand

They have some different choices than you maybe used to

I normally stick to the usual choices and have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Deluxe + black olive is my favourite also
The Mediterranean pizza is cool if you like feta cheese."}
{"text":"I ate here twice after reading the reviews. Wanting to try something different I ordered tandori chicken. Also tried the breadsticks hearing how great they were. I was disappointed on both items. They were of ok size but lacking flavour. 
The second time I tried butter chicken pizza for one and donair for the other. I love dominoes donair pizza which is full of flavour, but was again dissatisfied on my pizza's. 
Perhaps it is my taste that is too demanding, but I enjoy a good amount of pizza sauce. To me its the biggest part of the flavour. The peppers were nice and fresh, but reviews telling of loads of cheese are vastly exaggerated.
Overall, if you want to try some creative pizza ideas give this place a try. If you want good flavour go elsewhere."}
{"text":"$3 a slice, lots of cheese. Not familiar with the Calgary area, we were a couple from out of province, kind of lost while house hunting that just needed a quick lunch on the go. We were very satisfied with the pepperoni pizza. The slices are HUGE and my husband stated the person behind the counter was very nice. 
My only wish is that per slice, more pizzerias would carry veggie options. Veggie rocks and keeps that guilt meter down a bit when eating pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time a few weeks ago and have already had it many times. This place is so good, their pizza is delicious not to mention the amount you get for you money is unbelievable. A massive piece is 2$.. And it's so good. So glad we found the pizza place we will be going to forever!"}
{"text":"Awesome tasting pizzas.  You can do half n half which is a wicked deal to try different kinds.  The cottage special is off the chain.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered for 3 large pizzas for supper the other night. Arrived to the door in a timely fashion and while still hot(we are super close, maybe a 4 minute walk to them). I have to say that they are a very average pizza, especially since the bill was just over $60. Decent sauce, a little light on the toppings, and a pretty unremarkable crust. Crust was kind flat and more cardboard like then I prefer. None of the meat really blew my socks off, no real distinct flavours. Cheese was present, but not in any huge amount.

Overall, disappointing experience mostly due to value for dollar."}
{"text":"We just went there just because . We never heard of this place but ended up loving their pizza .It was so cheesy and had perfect amount of sauce. Good sizes for Large and medium. 
They have other options beside pizza: cheese bread, chicken wings, garlic breads, pakoras , fried chicken etc.
Bonus is that, they are halal and does delivery"}
{"text":"$2.99 for a slice? Seriously? Huzzah!!

I popped in here at the end of the lunch hour. I was expecting a less than stellar slice as I figured they made them before the lunch rush. The pizza however seemed to be quite fresh. There was a nice crispy layer of cheese on top and the crust matched. 

My only complaint about this place was the service. The guy working treated me more as an interruption than a customer. I hadn't even finished paying when he wandered off to the back to go back to whatever it was he was doing when I arrived."}
{"text":"I really like the Punjabi style pizzas. They are signature for this place and differentiate it from other places. a very nice change of pace!"}
{"text":"Awful food, so overpriced ! I do admit I enjoyed the fries , best I have found in Airdrie but the pizza is fighting the sauce tastes like ragu sauce."}
{"text":"I grabbed a slice of pizza at this Pizza Cottage location about a month ago an really enjoyed the pizza so I decided to order it again for delivery.  I called and ordered and about 30 minutes later they called back and asked where I lived because the delivery driver was having problems finding it on the GPS.  I had no problem giving them the directions to my house because GPSs have been known to be wrong for my address.  The directions were pretty simple and I didn't think I would hear from them after that.

Approximately 20 minutes after the first call, I received a call from the driver asking me where to go so I directed him and stayed on the phone until he said he was outside of my condo building.  I expected the buzzer for the front door to go off shortly after that but after 10 minutes my phone rang again and it was the delivery driver wondering what building in the complex I was in.  Any delivery driver should know that if your apartment number is 5607 then its building 5000, floor 6, apartment 5607 but apparently he didn't so I directed him to the correct building.  I then waited for the buzzer again which didn't come because he called me again saying that he was outside of my building.  I told him to ring my buzzer and I would let him in.  I waited another 5 minutes and then the buzzer rang.  I went in the hall and waited since I have a dog and didn't want him to knock on the door.  I'm not sure where he went after the buzzer but I waited 10 minutes for him to find my apartment.  

I asked when he left the restaurant and he said about 40 minutes ago which meant my pizza was cold so I mentioned this to him and he said nothing.  The restaurant is about 7-10 minutes from my house so its a little ridiculous that it took this long.  I paid him and brought my pizza inside to find it to be cold and not even close to the quality that I ate when I ate in store.  I would also like to mention that they have a policy that they won't deliver for under $25 before the $5 delivery fee.  I think the policy is okay but the delivery charge is a little high.  My order was about $15 and the person who I spoke with on the phone to order said they would do it anyway but what they did was just charge me $25.  Overall I was dissatisfied with  the service and the food."}
{"text":"Sweet.  Not sweet as in SWEEEEET-  The pizza had an overwhelmingly sweet taste, you can taste it in the sauce and in the crust.  If you have diabetes I would suggest going elsewhere.

I tried the supreme today, it was meh.  Nothing to write home about.  Just your run of the mill hole in the wall pizza place in Panorama; I still prefer Pizza Time on International Ave.  

Little Caesars beats it in my opinion. 2.5 stars because if you are a non-pork eater, this place is totally halal so the 'bacon' or 'sausage' offerings are beef or chicken based.

They sell pizza by the slice for about $3 and the slice is generous but not piping hot.

They also sell McKays ice cream which I find odd considering its a pizza joint."}
{"text":"This place has the best and most amazing twisty bread sticks in town. I go there JUST for them. 11/10 on the \"Tasty Bread\" as they call it.

Pizza wise, they are pretty darn big for the price for sure. That said, they are skimpy on the toppings, and their claim of \"unlimited toppings\" is a BIT sketchy because if you order 4 or 5 toppings you will find, for example, one mushroom per slice, hahah, that kinda thing.

Of note, is that this business is \"Halal\" (Like the Muslim equivalent of \"Kosher\"). Who cares? Well, the thing is they advertise that they use no pork products, yet they list bacon, ham, pepperoni etc as toppings. LOL so I guess thats all fine, but please tell us what exactly this \"Ham styled Halal Meat Product\" is exactly.

The \"$2.99 Super Huge Slices\" have been sitting under a heat lamp for hours or days, dont get them. For like $7 you can get a whole pizza made at this place anyway so whos in THAT big of a rush.

The young ladies who work there are always super friendly, but the males are always abrupt, look at the floor when speaking to you, and dont say much. Not sure what to make of that, I guess you can decide! :)

Happy Eating!"}
