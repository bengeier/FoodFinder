{"text":"Two of us ordered meat loaf and it  was terrible. My wife ordered the Philly Cheese Steak also terrible, can not hold a candle to Flancers' Philly. The only saving grace was the female server. Hadn't been here for awhile, maybe the appetizers might be good, but the meals and sandwiches are bad. It's got to be all the tv's installed."}
{"text":"Keep in mind this is a sports bar, however, we could not find ANYPLACE that was open Christmas Day as we had just flown in and had no fresh food in the house. Grocery stores closed also. Giving up & driving home we saw cars in a parking lot so went to check it out. Found this place open. The man that seated us couldn't have been more gracious, even though we had no reservations and it was BUSY. He found a table for us and his only request is that we be patient due to the amount of people. We both had a beer and fish & chips & it was GREAT! They also had a special prime rib dinner you could order and it looked good as well, and lots of people were ordering that. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"Great local pub food and staff is friendly and knows you by your name and treats you like family!

{"text":"Be prepared to wait a LONG time for your food. The servers are constantly coming around and saying how it'll just be a few more minutes (I have been here three times total on different days of the week, and it has always been the case).  I ordered 10 wings  and a basket of fries. The wings were pretty good (the 8 that were not shriveled up) but they also charged me $7.50 for a basket of fries. You've got to be kidding me - outrageous!"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting family.

Went in on a Sunday to watch the Jets game. It was crowded, but we didn't have to wait.

They immediately changed a TV close to us to the game so we could see it, which was nice.

Our server was pretty slow though, and never brought us water, though we asked twice. Food runner ended up bringing us water and a few extras to go with our food, since our server never checked back with us. If she was busy, we'd understand...but we never saw her anywhere...it was also only 2pm on a Sunday, and they were out of boneless wings...you'd think they'd be prepared on such a busy day.

TV's everywhere, great for watching sports. Fan's of every team inside. Entertaining. Fun friendly atmosphere.

We ended up just ordering a bunch of appetizers, and they were all really good!

Friend Zucchini was my favorite!"}
{"text":"Waited at least an hour to get food...and at least 30 mins to get another round of a drink."}
{"text":"Went to Echo 5 Sports bar after a round of golf for the Friday \"all you can eat\" fish and chips and was pleasantly surprised just how good it was. It took a little while to get the extra pieces of fish but worth waiting for. We then went back for the Sunday \"all you can eat\" fried chicken which is probably the best fried chicken in the southwest. If you like fried chicken or outstanding fish and chips I would highly recommend Echo 5."}
{"text":"Good food choices, fair drink prices with good quality and the wings are always a hit. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we were super disappointed in the new place. We've been twice before at the old place and thought it was good. Took my mom for Mother's Day and all of our food was overdone. Our fries were actually (burnt as in black) and they served them to us anyway, I couldn't believe it. I asked for my burger medium and it was well. Totally ruined it and it was a friggin $15 burger.  My husband got the fish and chips and his fish was totally fried too long.  Even my sons grilled cheese had burnt marks on it and he wouldn't eat it.  I used to be a server so I hate to complain especially since I knew we wouldn't be coming back.  So I'm writing this review to stop someone from wasting $70 like we did."}
{"text":"Service was horrible today. Not sure I'll go back. Too many other places in same area."}
{"text":"On our way home from Phoenix on Valentine's Day around 6:30 pm. My wife called the restaurant to order wings for carry out. The first two times, she received a recorded announcement asking her to leave a message. The third time, she spoke with Bianca. Bianca was short, curt and very unprofessional. My wife ordered thirty wings medium/grilled with blue cheese and vegatables. Bianca told her the order would,be ready in 20-25 minutes. It took us about 15 minutes to arrrive at the restaurant. I waited in the car an additional five minutes or so before going in to pickup the order. When I entered, I indicated that we placed a carry out order from Bianca. The hostess suggested a I wait at the bar while she checks on the order. About 5 minutes later, as I was sitting at the bar, the hostess came from the kitchen and said, \"our kitchen is backed up so it will be a while before your order is ready\". When I asked how long, she said 25 minutes. I told her that Bianca told us 25 minutes nearly 20 minutes ago. She just looked at me. I asked her to cancel the order and asked to speak with the manager or owner. She indicated that neither were present. I asked for the owners name and phone number, she said she wasn't allowed to give out that information. I asked just for the owners name, and she said she didn't know it. It was then that little Miss Bianca shouts from behind the bar,\"hey, what's going on?\" I spun around and asked if the person yelling at me was Bianca and she confirmed that it was. I told her that she was rude in the phone and our order is now 20-25 minutes late. She said, its Valentine's, and we're busy. Just to paint the picture, I saw five open seats at the bar and at least 8 -9 open tables at in the seating area. I indicated that it's pretty unusual for a restaurant to have the kitchen backed up when the place was not full. Bianca told me to just leave, she didn't need to hear my comments. We have eaten at Echo 5 on a few ocaassions, sadly each time we leave a little disappointed. However, after tonight and the treatment Bianca offerd, we will never return and I encourage others to stay away."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and great service! Stevie and Lori are the best! Very quick and always super happy and welcoming! Definitely one of me and my daughters favorite places to grab some food!!"}
{"text":"We've been to echo 5 several times and I  have to say the help is spot on and the food is great!! The food is always great. I will definitely becoming back here. Thanks for the great service!! Love theTV's and able to watch all the games!!"}
{"text":"Very nice pub type setting with several Flat screen TV's.  Patio would be perfect if it was non-smoking. Appetizers are pretty good, particularly the hot wings, fries, cheese curds and buffalo shrimp. Service could be way better. Price was relative."}
{"text":"Been coming here since it opened as Indigo Joes. Several management changes later it became E-5 and went to crap. Service is abominable and prices too high for what is really nothing more than a dive bar. If you sit at the bar, be sure to count your change carefully - the bartender is not shy about padding her tip. I only stop in now once a year or so to see if it has changed hands (and the little E-5 Leprechaun is gone)."}
{"text":"We've been going to this location since it was built and watched it change ownership and names many times.  Echo 5 is a great improvement.  Good food and friendly efficient service, especially on the patio, and the music is outstanding!  It's become our favorite neighborhood place for a relaxing, casual meal."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible experience over all.  Ordered the Shepards Pie, which showed up with instead of a layer of mash on top, was a glop of mash.  Dish was not baked, nor was the filling appetizing.  When I complained about the quality of the meal, no refund was offered, unlike every other restuarant I've ever been in.  Bad food can be excused with the service is good, however in this case both were dreadful.  Will definitely not return."}
{"text":"The Food is pretty good. The service seems very short staffed. The smoking is terrible even though it is outside. Not enough breeze to blow the stench out. I will not be back nor recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of times and will be going more often.

The establishment feels like a sports bar with lots of TVs(No UFC) The waiting staff is friendly, they could be a tad faster. 

As for the food, the wings are superb though I would ask for them a tad crispier for next time. They grill them after being fried it really adds something to them. I'm definetly getting them again. My friends ordered sandwiches and they were very big portions and everyone seemed to enjoy it. 

They have a great selection of beer. They do offer the hard to find Irish cream beer \"Kilkinney\" 

I wish they stayed open later during the week. The prices are a bit high compare to other sports bar. But it's comparable to other places in the area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first dinner at Echo 5 last night. Not knowing much about the restaurant I knew we were in a good place once I seen the Marine Corps sticker on the front door; later I learned the own is a Marine.  Which is where the name comes from. \"Semper Fi sir\"

As a picky food person I found their food pretty dang good. The fries need a make over however the fish was good and everything we have on one of the appetizer platers was cook amazing. First place I've been to in a while where I felt satisfied when I let. Our waiter was awesome to and had a very fun personality."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place last weekend. The reviews were really good. My husband decided to try the burger, and chose his specifically because of bacon on it. When the food arrived, after a couple of bites he asked the waitress about the bacon. Come to find out, the kitchen was out of bacon. He would have ordered something different knowing that. The \"bacon\" topic has come up ever time this place has come up. That being said, the waitress did her best to make up for it, after he told her about it.  We ordered the chicken tender basket for our daughter. SO nice to get freshly breaded and made chicken. More amazing, is that my child ate it all. My cobb salad was really tasty, but I think I want to come back on Sunday for the fried chicken. =) The only downside was that service was a bit slow, and it took forever to get the check, pay, and leave."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places. The food is great. Great Berger, fish and chips are very good. The wings and buffalo shrimp are a must try. The staff and service are GREAT!  Friendly fun place to hangout."}
{"text":"This place is great; plenty of beers in tap, full bar, friendly service, good food and HUGE portions.  Nice local pub to grab a bite and beer"}
{"text":"5 of us stopped in for a couple drinks after riding motorcycles up north. Had a couple of drinks and my friend had the ice cream. Great and friendly staff. Tons of TV's, looks like it may be a new stop for us!"}
{"text":"Entered the bar was seated right away. College World Series was on. 30 tvs 1 had baseball, 3 had golf, the rest had NHL asked the hostess to put on the CWS on one tv it is on ESPN comes back says we do not have ESPN First shock. Waitress  comes ask her to put ESPN on at least one tv. Give order get food. Waitress comes back nope we do not have ESPN. Shocked I say and you call yourself a sports bar? Let your manager know we will be wrighting a review and letting people know you call yourself a sports bar and do not have ESPN. She does not let the owner/manager know but talks to the hostess who comes back with the waitress and a paper and says yes we do have ESPN we will put it on. In the mean time we have our order already and half way finished before they put on the game. I do not know about you but when I walk into a sports bar I would think I would not have to ask for the CWS to be put on. Fault of the owner /manager for not having someone who know sports scanning the guide for multiple  sports on different  tvs.

Now for the food! On menu Steak and fries description 10 Oz ribeye with garlic butter and fries Ask for onion rings instead. Get my order it is a sirlion and no garlic butter. Waitress to busy to ask her about it. Steak was okay but when you do not get what you ordered it is disappointing. By the way as you can see on their online menu there is no sirloin steaks. Onion rings were the frozen type and greasy. Had a taste of the French fries they were a thin home style but under cooked. My friend did not eat any of his fries. He ordered the Buffalo wings mild which were medium to hot and we're grilled. We did not order the Shrimp Poboy but in the description it said on a Hoggee? What everyone who knows food knows that Poboys or French bread not hogee. Another menu fail in the description. Beers were priced at $5 uggh. It did not help that the father of the family of 4 next to us was eating his buggers, not the fault of the restaurant. 

I would not recommend  this place to anyone. Over priced and total menu failure. You would be better off passing this place and finding a true sports bar."}
{"text":"We recently relocated to Mesa and wanted to find a local hangout.  We've enjoyed Echo since our first visit and now go very regularly. They were in the middle of changing things over when we started going - changing the menu, adding TVs on the patio - and it has been great. The food is excellent. We've tried several items, including Sunday brunch and have never been disappointed. Sometimes when it's busy, service can be slow but the waitstaff is extremely friendly and we aren't there to rush, we're there to relax and enjoy ourselves so it's not an issue for us. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips and a Guinness. The fish was good but the chips were nothing special. Shoestring fries for fish and chips is just wrong. The Guinness was a bit warm, which is how it's supposed to be but I got the feeling that this was not on purpose. What made the meal less than memorable was the very slow service. The place was busy but not enough so to explain away how slow it was. I'd come back again, just won't be counting the days until then."}
{"text":"So update...they got rid of the pretzels but found new pretzel sticks that were also really good. Just called tonight to grab an order and now they don't sell the cream cheese fondue...boo heartbroken. :-("}
{"text":"Went in around 845.  In the 45 min that we were there... The brunette bartender (Laura) took 3 shots of Deep Eddy's Grapefruit Vodka secretly out of rocks glasses at the service bar.   The blonde bartender (Erin) was much more engaging and did a good job... Except for maybe swapping our beers (80% sure).  The food came out fast and was average as best.   Southwest egg rolls were tasty but obviously frozen.  The pulled pork sliders were average and lukewarm.  The most notable thing was the very comfy bar stools.  This place was busy! It has a good lay out and would be ideal to watch a game.   They just need management! The lack of any type of uniform or standards create a chaotic feel. There seemed to be a lack of training or structure.  I saw cameras but no one seems to be watching...  

This place has potential.  Just needs a strong management team!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I've been here a few times now and every time it's been excellent. Very friendly staff, AMAZING food, great beer and liquor selection... They show tons of sports games and are willing to change the channel to a game you want. They allow dogs on the patio AND there's a little cigar bar next door that you can buy stuff from and smoke on the patio as well. (They have a cigar section so you don't need to be around the smoke if you don't like it. Very courteous!) It's a nice detour from rowdy crowds, but you'll definitely have a good time! The owners are also two of the nicest guys around! And our waitress last time was Joanne; she was very sweet and super attentive! Come here--- I promise you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Karissa is the best! Every time I come she memorizes what I like to drink and makes sure we are happy with the service. I definitely recommend Echo 5 to anyone looking for some great food and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! Fantastic beer selection. Food is better than you might expect at a sports bar. Tons of TVs with more than just crappy sports talk shows with no sound. Seriously- they have hockey, soccer, whatever actual sports that are going on. A new favorite for me!"}
{"text":"Seems good if you want a drink and to watch the game. Food service has a few bumps. In five visits I've had three mixed up orders. Grilled AZ Gold wings are super delicious."}
{"text":"I thought I'd give this place another go, because I really want to like it.  This time the husband came with and we pretty much left saying we weren't going to hurry back.  I do want to say that the staff was great - we were greeted when we walked in the door and service was prompt and friendly.  And I like how they've decorated the place to give it a welcoming vibe.  But the food.... while my husband and I both agreed that none of the food we ordered was bad, it wasn't great either.  My favorite thing was the jalapeno cheese curds.  They were pretty good.  My husband got a BLT, potato soup, and salad, all of which he said were just \"okay.\" I got the club sandwich, and while the bread was pleasantly toasted, the sandwich as a whole was kind of dry, and the bacon was not crisp and had an odd flavor.  And the sweet potato fries looked a little burnt and tasted dry.  I took one bite of the fries and had enough.  I'm sure our server would've brought a new order if I had said something, but I didn't get the impression that even cooked right they would be worth the calories.  

Maybe I am just not ordering the right things off the menu.... like I said, I really want to like this place."}
{"text":"Service is terrible still sitting at the bar wanting another drink sent the wings back twice ordered tacos instead absolutely terrible
Tired of waiting for a cocktail going somewhere else 
Will not come back again and will not recommend this this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  television everywhere including patio. Order Philly with onion rings,  not the standard garbage frozen onion rings that are chopped and formed!  Real onion rings dipped in a very tasty batter and not burnt. As for the Philly,  none of that shaved steak here it is a thin steak that is chopped and put onto a soft hoagie with red and green peppers, onions, mushrooms and provolone melted on top. Very good and not at all chewy. Staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Decent food, TERRIBLE service. Waited 30 minutes or more for the bill. Won't be back.


Update: against my better judgement I decided to return to Echo 5 to give it another go. If I could could give negative stars, I would. This time the service was equally bad and the food matched. How are they even open??"}
{"text":"Bangers and mash were on point. The onion gravy was goo, and the potatoes were perfect. Would eat there again."}
{"text":"We have been in a few times since my first review. Things are changing. I was very impressed on a visit (a year ago) how HUGE the order of zucchini was! On our last visit the portion size was a joke. It kind of made me mad. We only needed one side of ranch when we usually need two. Then literally we got our entrees 45 seconds after bring served the joke of the appetizer. We will probably come back but it won't be my choice."}
{"text":"Great place to watch any game you wish, the staff is great, the food is always to my liking and the drinks are always fresh and cold. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Interesting location. Excellent food. Great beer. Waiters are very nice people. Really injoyed my stay."}
{"text":"First time visit and enjoyed our food and atmosphere. Love the fact that this is veteran owned and managed.  Hence the Echo5 name....

Cheese sticks had good flavor but were a little soft marinara was sweet and the parmesan crumbs better than the shredded I've had at other restaurants. 

Wings were real good.   Not real fatty or over cooked like so many other locations.  Good texture and smooth flavor with just the perfect amount of sauce. 

BBQ sliders were reaaaaal good.  Sweet with a touch of heat in the sauce.  

Son had bacon burger and her enjoyed that as well. 

My youngest had the chicken Parmesan sand which and really liked it as well."}
{"text":"Everyone is so nice and you can always get a seat at the bar. Great place if you want to watch soccer. Their menu changes every once in awhile which throws me off, but still, very good!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I gave this place another try. All 3 times I've been here are bad. Nonexistent service, mediocre food, small portions. Oh well. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night and it was very busy. Had the special Vineyard meal. Great deal with lots of meat and choice of fries or mashed potatoes. My wife had a huge Cobb salad. Only problem we had was the front entrance is a very heavy door which we thought was locked. We searched for a second entrance and came in through the smokers area. Typical sports decor. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Yummy food and service is great! And the patio is very dog friendly! Our favorite place to dine with our Great Dane!"}
{"text":"This is becoming a nice little SEAHAWKS bar!! We come and watch a lot of the games and there is always a bunch of 12s. 

Beer is cold, food is good, wait staff is splendid...and they have a TON of TVs!! 

This is a very nice sports bar!  Come and enjoy."}
{"text":"Oh Echo 5. I do want to like you. I do want you to succeed. 

But - $9 for potato skins and this is all you get? They were tasty....but $9? For 4 halves? Really? That's all?

The service - it's ok, but not fabulous.

The food is ok - but not great. 

And I hate to be the person who is all whiny and \"but I miss something from the oooolllldddd menu\" - but - dangit, I really miss the deliciousness of the previous iterations of the Buffalo Chicken Salad that had been in place over the previous 3 or 4 owners. :-( It was so much better."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. The food is descent but the service is horrific!! Went here again today and had the WORST service ever! Waited to be seated for 15 minutes before anyone came to the counter to seat us then ordered iced tea and the waitress never brought sweetener to the table after asked. Ordered the all-you-can-eat fish and waitress never checked on us after she left the food. Instead of all you can eat it's more like all the waitress will serve you which is no more than you get on the plate the first time. She never came back at all! We had to go inside to ask for ketchup which was never received, had to go inside to ask for more iced tea which we never got, and had to go inside to get the bill. Paid the bill and left a 10% tip even though I didn't feel the waitress deserved it. Accidentally left my debit card and by the time I realized it was missing and went back to see if it was turned in the waitress had thrown it out in the trash, never to be seen again. I will never ever, ever go back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Nice spirts bar with a pretty straight forward menu. I ordered grilled chicken wings with the sauce on the side and wow! Very good...good seasoning and freshly cooked. I also ordered the Blackened Caesar salad. Both dishes were awesome and full of flavor. The wait time was not bad at all, around 15-20m from order to delivery. I washed it down with a nice cold Michelob Ultra. 

The wait staff was friendly and attentive and provided excellent service.

Enjoy the multitude of T.V's and ample seating available.

They have happy hour specials $1 off craft and import drafts house wine,$3 drink specials, $5 appetizer specials. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"this pub has been 6 differant places in the 7 years i have lived here  every time it changes hands they seam to to keep with the same menu and decor this new owner has gone w/ a irish sort of feel. they have redone(or bought new ones) the chairs with a leather finish the front door has been painted red again bit of a euro pub feel. they do sport a good beer selection and the service was friendly but i did sit with an empty beer glass for about 10 minutes while eating my natchos which were ok. says they do breakfast on the weekends. menu again seems to be the standard pub fair"}
{"text":"All the food is soooo good! I definitely recommend the nachos, Sunday night bottomless chicken dinner, hot pretzel, and the brownie! The portions are good for sharing especially the brownie! It's seriously the best brownie I have ever had! Staff is super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Best place in East Mesa to grab a pint, enjoy some good music, good conversation and good bar food. You feel very welcome to sit back and just hang out awhile, this is definitely the new neighborhood hangout. I know this place has changed quite a few times, but I hope this one sticks around because it seems they finally got it right. Everyone there is super friendly, especially the REALLY good looking new male bartender they hired! ;)"}
{"text":"I came here to watch college football. I thought i would try the new pub. It's a warm friendly environment for families. I had some excellent cheese curds! I had some great beers from thier ample draft selection. All staff members were friendly and cortious and offered recommendations! I had a great time on their patio and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Like all sports bars you are fighting/annoying other patrons by requesting a channel change.  I would say this place is an \"Arizona\" sports bar.  Meaning they will play any Arizona sports team first. The food is okay.  The beer selection is okay.   The prices are okay.  If you are in NE Mesa this is the place to go for the amount of tv's. , size, reasonable prices, and it is very clean and the staff is pleasant.  

Ive been back a few times.  The beer selection has gotten better, but the food hasn't.  I want this place to succeed- maybe they should start asking for suggestions/ reviews .....and put it to good use."}
{"text":"Maybe I should have known better but given all the great reviews here I thought why the hell not? If its on the menu it should be good right? WRONG. We ordered the salmon with broccoli and sweet potato fries.. Salmon was super dry, the brocolli was super cold and was boiled should have been blanched, and the sweet potato fries were sooooooo soggy and cold to the touch! When we told the waitress she brought out a new hot basket but they were still super soggy. Literally limp sweet potato fries. Would not recommend the gourmet items on the menu."}
{"text":"I am thrilled my husband and I found this place.  Mesa and east Mesa is lacking in good bars and locally owned restaurants. For the people who are reviewing this place regarding their salmon and broccoli... I mean really? It is a PUB, i.e. nachos, burgers, wings, salads, drinks, tv's.... I might add that they should minimize the menu and get rid of items that aren't ordered consistently.  We have only sat outside and have always had good service and excellent food.  Last time we were in I ordered a Cobb salad, HALF SIZE and it was huge and so fresh.  My husband ordered a BLT and it was delicious too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area nice little place you watch a sports. Great drinks prices. Quiet and peaceful. Great staff."}
{"text":"Recently went to Echo 5. The food was amazing and the service was speedy and courteous. Im definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and a nice patio to have our dog join us.  Misters and shade and fans make it pleasant even in the June heat!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at this establishment the young lady that waited on me and a couple of pals was simply outstanding, there was no questions what so ever and not once did any of my party have to ask for refills or any other service.  The food was great we ordered from the lunch menu which is kinda short but pretty good, I am looking forward to a return trip to order from the Dinner Menu."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to meet up here Thursday evening (9/28) as first timers here. Out first thought was that the draft beer list was very limited but we appreciated the tv selection being a \"sports bar.\" Our server was an older lady and initially, super attentive and friendly. My hubby ordered the Thursday special and found it mediocre, I ordered the shrimp basket and was very disappointed. The worst though was that my friend ordered a burger and when asked, requested Medium Rare. Upon receiving, he took a bite, showed us and there was no pink whatsoever. We didn't see our server so another girl there noticed my searching and said \"no problem, we will get you a new one.\" Our original server then brought the once-bitten burger BACK to our table and asked my friend, and I quote, \"Did you even take a bite out of this?? It looks different in the kitchen!\" Are you kidding me????? Right then, at that very moment, she lost all respect we had and guaranteed the 4 of us will never return. First off, I don't care what it looks like, seems like, appears to be... if a patron is unsatisfied with their order; you fix it. No questions asked. You don't bring it back to the table and chastise them about their opinion. Second of all, how would you know it looks different in the kitchen without cutting into it. Light or no light, there is a flavor difference between medium rare and well done. My husband and I had a $115 tab, and our friends' was close to that. We are typically 25% tippers as I've worked in this industry before. We gave her 10%. When a client/patron isn't happy, never, ever, assign blame on the client. Just take it back and fix it or take it off the tab. We won't recommend and we will absolutely not be back."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times, but tonight - they almost put me into epileptic shock because they're degenerates who don't listen to important food allergies (even when they're not that busy.) I ordered a sandwich without tomatoes (because I'm allergic) or mayo (because it's disgusting.) After waiting forever for my dinner, when it arrived, I immediately jumped in and took a big bite, not noticing it's literally covered with both. Of course I spit it right out onto my plate to hopefully avoid an ER visit... now it's just a wait and see game, hoping for the best. :(

Oh, and not to mention they get my order wrong somehow every single time and tonight, didn't have any steak in stock whatsoever to accommodate what my other 3 table mates ordered. 

Thanks, Echo 5, for putting me in terrified tears. Debating on reporting them elsewhere... if nothing else, to get their attention and make them train their terrible servers better. Just awful! Awful food, service, and delivery times! Run!!"}
{"text":"Great folks, food and Guinness, just don't invite Bushmills to the party!  Always have a great time here.  Definitely give the wings a shot, they're excellent!  I can't wait to find another excuse to return!"}
{"text":"Fantastic menu! Great food! Reasonable prices! Lots of great daily specials and happy hour drinks and appetizer specials! Had the Friday all you can eat fish fry and a the Arizona Cobb Salad... Highly recommend both!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I love to sit on the patio! The service and food are great! Drinks are moderately priced, and they have an ok happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I work nearby and this is always the \"farewell\" happy hour spot. I was in yesterday around 4:30 PM and 2 of us ordered the advertised daily special of all you can eat spaghetti and meatballs. Our server took our orders and returned from the kitchen a few minutes later informing us the food would take 1 hour to prepare and be ready at 5:30. That's right, you can get any other entree on the menu cooked up, but boiling pasta water was a bit too complicated. There was no indication on the menu of the daily specials starting at 530 PM, and our server only knew after returning from the kitchen. Sounds like they just didn't want to bother cooking up the special orders. Bait and switch at it's finest. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Echo offered a patio outside so we sauntered in. The patio is a lively atmosphere with a comfy setup. 
We ordered drinks and burgers. The server Alissa didn't quite understand that a person can die of thirst in the desert. Water was in short supply! 
Drinks took forever...
I give them 3 stars for atmosphere and the food but they loose a star for poor service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as it is close to home.  The service is lacking here.  This  place was not crowded but it took 30 minutes to get a burger and 3 street tacos. When the food arrived, both our orders were cold.  The fish in the taco was burnt. The carne asada was barely there and pork was pulled pork.  The burger cooked medium, as requested, was dry and tasteless.  We didn't complain because we will not be back.  Very disappointing.  Who can't make a decent burger?"}
{"text":"Just ok. Not very busy, yet service was slow. Server was unhappy. Food was mediocre. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Came here for a work happy hour & it was a cool place. There were a bunch of apps on the table when I arrived -- the fried zucchini was so good & same with the potato skins. The wings looked good but I didn't have any. Perfect if you're craving that salty, fried bar food & want to watch a game on TV, there are a bunch of TV's around the restaurant. I had a tall 22oz beer on draft and it was only $5, not sure if that's happy hour or normal pricing. We came on a Wednesday around 4pm and it was pretty dead, probably beat the dinner crowd and there weren't really any sporting events on. I would come back."}
{"text":"This place has changed hands several times, but the latest incarnation is REALLY good! The staff is friendly and the food yummy!! Try this place for sure..."}
{"text":"I went here once and was not at all pleased. The service was slow, my order got messed up and the waitress was more concerned with gossiping with other staff members than taking our drink order. The burgers were dry and were not cooked to the temperature we ordered. It also took forever for the waitress to bring us back our change after we paid. I actually had to ask her to bring us our change and she had the nerve to say that she didn't think we needed any. I'm sorry, but I gave her a $100 bill and the total bill was $47. That really shocked me"}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy my first visit to our local sports pub.
I was very disappointed. 
When we visited it was not crowded, yet we waited over 20 minutes for our meal with cigarette smoke wafting in from their patio.
As I ordered a side salad I thought it would come out first. Instead it came with my meal.
Now let me say my sons Red Mountain Burger got rave reviews. He said it was great.
The Carne Asada street tacos my wife ordered were ok, just a little greasy.
But what really let me down was the Fish and Chips.
I was hoping for a couple of pieces of nice golden Cod.
What I got appeared to be 3 fish chunks that had been forgotten in a deep fat fryer where the oil is long overdue for a change.
The second bad sign was that I needed a knife to cut it and it had the consistency of fish jerky.
I would have complained to the waiter, but he never came back after delivering the meal until he brought the check.
When he did bring the check I told him that whoever killed the fish should never be allowed in a kitchen again.
He apologized and walked away.
Now Echo 5 stands for Sargent in the USMC and they play up the Marine theme.
As a parent of an active duty Marine (Who was home on leave and loving his burger)
I was hoping that a manager or owner would come up to apologize and take ownership for the poor service and food, but that never happened.

Time to call Bar Rescue..."}
{"text":"Perfect southwestern hospitality and yes it is an 'American' pub!  As many of my readers know, I'm not a Sports Bar fan, but since this is a Sports Pub, I gave it a chance.  A friend and I were out to grab some beers, a game and hopefully some traditional public house food. This unpretentious sports pub grabs you the moment you walk in. With its Saloon bar, café/diner look and wtw TVs with memorabilia combination, it is a great change of pace from the big box, run-of-the-mill so-called sports bars you'll find anywhere! Mike, the owner, and all his folks not only know hospitality and wear great smiles, with stupendous service, but have an incredible array of offerings! My Buddy ordered their Green Chili Burger with New Mexico Green Chilis, Pepper jack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato and homemade spicy mayo!  Made uniquely flavorful, you have to try their good old fashioned, traditional Lamb Shepard's Pie (SP)... incredible! As a SP lover, I was amazed at how well the ratios of onion to garlic to thyme to rosemary were, not to mention, just the right amount of Worcestershire sauce... just enough for taste but not overwhelming! Echo 5 is the first sports anything I've liked, and is highly recommended for the folks, ambience, comfort, hominess, hospitality, great tastes and plain good food... Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and the owner is a nasty excuse for a human being! Las Sendas is a family community and Echo 5 touts itself as family friendly which it most definitely is not! I have witnessed the owner being nasty before and heard stories of other people having run ins with him, but I guess last night was my turn. Took my concerns to the neighborhood website and cannot believe the outpouring of others being subject to his nastiness and how many members of our community feel the same way and cannot wait for Zipps to open so that they have better options near by and it puts him put of business. Save yourself the aggravation and drive a little further for better food at a better price and hospitable environment. I will add in closing that our waitress was lovely, apologized profusely for his behavior and told us this is not the first time she has had complaints about him by a long shot. I wish her the best and hope to see her working elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Well I've been there about 6 times. Unfortunately, the food keeps disappointing me. Service is good but the food is horrible."}
{"text":"Easy access after a day on the river. Large sports bar with large patio with misters. Most stuffed chicken quesadilla I have ever had, but really, it was the owner I presume) and staff that made the visit so enjoyable. Looks like a great sports bar. TVs everywhere!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and great atmosphere. They have T.V.s everywhere and they will put on any game you want! The food is so good and the staff is super friendly and very personable! I come here every Sunday to watch a game and just hangout with friends. Karissa was our waitress and was so nice and made the experience that much better! Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is usually one of our go to places for wings and fish. We took guests there last night and we were so disappointed. Service was terrible!  We were there. Early two hours waiting on our food drinks. Salad was served after our entrees. My wings were cold. Guests were burnt. All you can eat fish was non existent. My husband had to ask for another piece and then wait 20\". I'm not sure we will ever go back."}
{"text":"We came here for a typical date night because all the other restaurants in north east Mesa has long waits. 

The positives are it wasn't busy and they have good beers on tap. They have plenty of TVs for sports watching and the bar can make any drink. Their wings were good and they have some good flavored available. 

The bad is the service was inattentive. The wings were the best part. It went down hill after that. We ordered nachos as an appetizer and they were absolutely terrible. The guacamole was old and bitter, the cheese was shredded cheese that was melted in the microwave. The ground beef appeared to be a frozen hamburger and overall they had to be the worst nachos I've ever had. This place could be a great spot but they need to work on their food and service quality. They had items that were not available but still on the menu."}
{"text":"Great! We love it here. I have enjoyed everything we have ordered. The pretzel and cheese are the best in town! My husband comes here quite a bit for happy hour. The staff are quick and courteous, great neighborhood and family friendly bar."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tons of draft beer selections including Kilkenny which is hard to find. The Arizona Gold flavored wings are incredible and they have a super dog friendly patio which is awesome. They even bring your dog bacon and carrots and a bowl of ice water! The bartender Bianca is a sweetheart too. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We want to make Echo 5 our local pub, and the wings are great, but we have some issues. I know the new owners have been working hard and making improvements. But the music is really bad, and it's too loud. We're guessing it's what the owners personally like to listen to, but I wish they wouldn't subject their guests to it. It's an irritating mix of mostly country, combined with occasional, obscure songs from other genres. Today we waited for over 20 minutes for our server to come back and take our order, so we gave up and left. If they were really busy I'd understand, but it was 2pm on a Sunday and mostly empty."}
{"text":"Place has gone down the crapper!!!  40 min wait for water and nachos???  Sheriff Joe treats his tent city prisoners better!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I brought our dog here after hiking last weekend; we sat on the patio and they thoughtfully brought out a bowl of ice water and a couple of slices of bacon for our dog!  (She was in doggie heaven!)

Our server was friendly, prompt and efficient and our food and drinks were good and well priced.  I had the appetizer of friend chicken livers and okra, it was very tasty and the food was piping hot.  He had a burger with green chilies and a delicious potato salad. The patio was clean, the décor was nice and the music playing overhead was perfect, with just enough Irish jigs thrown in to keep true to the Irish bar theme.  

We will absolutely be coming back here again with our dog and next time we will likely bring our kids and friends too!"}
{"text":"Fun sports bar. Had the fish and chips and they were as good as I have ever had. Service was friendly and they have great tv's to watch the games."}
{"text":"The crowd is late 50s plus.  Tables were all high tops with maybe three booths inside.  Outdoor seating looked great however there is a cigar bar next door which then also resulted in the patio being a place to smoke cigars. Food was sub-par. My partner threw up within 30 minutes after leaving. 

Our waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"This locally owned pub is a great place for some decent bar food and the Game!! As Seahawks fans, we catch a lot of games at Echo 5 and staff always takes great care of us! There is even a little arcade room or the kids!"}
{"text":"Went back after several weeks.  The service had become poor.  The servers didn't seem to care much about anything beyond a basic service model.  I am pleased to say tonight the service had come back to what was there when I started going.  The food is always good.  The server was quite personable and helpful check back several times to make sure everything was ok.  Usually a single gets ignored but not tonight.  Great job and good food."}
{"text":"3 of us had lunch here. 2 ordered fish&chips with a side salad, the third person had Italian beef sandwich with side salad. Each of us had 2 domestic beers.  The fish and chips were good.  The sandwich was an, \"eh\". Our Miller Lites in bottle we're not cold. Server was good. 

The kicker was the bill!   With 20% tip the bill was $85!!? 

I'd HIGHLY recommend trying a different bar/restaurant if you find yourself in East Mesa."}
{"text":"What a great find! Service was awesome, food was great and the vibe was spot on. The manager made sure we had a TV close to us with the game on that we came to watch, even though it was during the World Series. I had the garlic burger and it was really good! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Here's a break down of my experience

Good
fried zuc appetizer
salmon salad
ahi tuna salad

Bad
nachoes
any of their burgers
service
too loud of an environment

Won't be back due to the decline in service."}
{"text":"The food here is delish! But my favorite part is the fact that they are so, so pet friendly! I bring my dogs and sit on the patio. They bring out huge bowls of ice water, bacon, and dental chews!! Gotta love it!"}
{"text":"I used to love it here. I visited 12/11/15 for happy hour to find the owner on his computer not paying attention to people arriving and the place getting busy. The music on the radio was horrible. When we asked the waiter to put something more modern and upbeat on he said the owner wouldn't let him. I am not a maestro but sappy old music can kill anyone's mood. Then the owner came out to the patio where we were and yelled at our waiter that he was going to fire someone for not doing their job. We were dumbfounded. He saw us sitting there. Finally our crappy food came. It was obvious that we were unhappy and the crappy owner didn't acknowledge us. I don't know where the last  owner  went but this place sucks now.  Don't bother. The wine bar and Italian place down the walkway are better!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic here, and if you like sports there is no better place to catch a game -- there is literally a TV everywhere you look."}
{"text":"Alright, Well the beer is delicious, but that is the same for 98% of the bars in mesa that serve cold beer. The food however has become subpar. I went on Taco Tuesday and ordered what they told me are the street tacos. Right away I lit up like a kid on Christmas!!! Street Tacos are my favorite!! I ordered 3 shredded beef Street tacos and the waiter assured me these are authentic street tacos after I asked a million questions.They brought 3 cold corn tortillas with a blob of crock pot beef roast... It was disgusting. I even told the waiter the least they could have done was shred the beef. I took 1 bite after shredding it myself and the meat had no flavor and was chewy as hell. (being Mexican I had to say a quick prayer for the restaurant to be forgiven for serving and calling it tacos). There is a recipe on the world wide web that could have been followed and tasted phenomenal, but instead they served blob, fatty piece of pot roast, which was quickly returned.... I have not gone back to Echo 5 for tacos since then."}
{"text":"The bartender Ricky is the best! However, the food has gone downhill since they started listening to Robby's cheapskate ways. Fried chicken is the worst, microwaved frozen parts-is-parts chicken strips, brine injected jumbo chicken wings and powdered mashed potatoes. Definitely gone downhill."}
