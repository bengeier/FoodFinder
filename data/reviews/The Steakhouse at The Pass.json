{"text":"We heard good things about this place so we decided to try it. Nice atmosphere inside and the wait staff very courtious. We had the Ribeye and Chicken Parmesan. The Ribeye was very disappointing. It was just ok. No seasonings or flavor. Just plain. Chicken parmesan was ok. We paid alot of money for an average meal. Don't mind paying for a good steak. This place didn't fit the bill."}
{"text":"Let's start with the bad. The guy at the door gave me a bit of an obnoxious vibe. The decor/atmosphere... outdated, dark, and you have to walk through a casino to get there. Last of all, my waiter... started off pretty creepy... like gonna poison your food and then you wake up in a basement type of creepy. Now the good. That creepy waiter... became super honest, nice, and damn funny! The food was also a huge plus. The waiter dropped off a basket of bread with 3 different types that were all pretty tasty. I started with the french onion soup and my date had a house salad. Although not the best french onion soup I've ever had... it did qualify as one of. The salad was pretty large, fresh, and had plenty of toppings. For an entr√©e we ordered the large prime rib. Not only the best tasting, but also the biggest I've ever seen! The garlic mashed potatoes were delicious, and the squash... a bit sweeter than what I was expecting... but tasted great! Now to the price. With all that food... which was more than enough for two... and 4 bottles of beer... the bill came to $54! More than reasonable for the experience and quality. 5 stars with no hesitation!"}
{"text":"wow was expecting good food from the reviews i read, but wasn't expecting this i ordered the new york strip massive, parents ordered veal picatta and filet mignon and french onion soup which wasn't salted at all. all amazing steaks cooked perfectly. will go back again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"So this was the first time ever going there and yes you never believe is beautiful little place is just off the highway surround my nothing.  My wife and I went because I wanted prime rib and the reviews were really good and were passing by and decided what the heck.  First the restaurant didn't smell like smoke which my wife hates when we go to casinos !  The water boy was so attentive. he even fought a extra carafe for my soda. And I drink a lot and it bugs me when I have to flag someone down.  I wasn't without soda through my whole meal. That 4 star to start.  The waitress was all smiles and really engaged with us. My wife order the regular cut and I ordered the steakhouse cut and in reality we should have shared my wife cut. The portions were huge!!! More then enough trust and believe  And we couldn't pass up dessert the chocolate cake was ridiculously good.  But again we brought like half of it home. More like 3/4 really. Even the coffee I got was very yummy.  All in all this was overall a delicious meal and worth a 20 minute drive out of vegas to go. If u want a true prime rib vegas style this is definitely the place to go.   It's funny there was a line to the cafe which had a prime rib special but we were seated quickly and everything was worth our cost. Two people w tip rand 80 bucks really the value was The Steakhouse !"}
{"text":"Three stars for the food: I had the ribeye and it was ok - nothing any more special than I've had at home. My boyfriend liked the prime rib though. He order the regular cut and it was massive - easily 2\" thick. The 4th star is for the ambiance with live piano music and for the waiter giving me an extra piece of cheesecake to go! We will go back just to explore the menu a little more. I saw a few shrimp cocktails going by that looked great with big prawns, those will be a must next trip."}
{"text":"I love this steakhouse!!! The food is great and the prices are right in line with what I think they should be! The only reason that I am giving four stars, instead of five, is that their wine list is terrible! They should consider having a nice mix of wine offerings or, promote a reasonable corkage fee.   When I have a big, juicy steak, I really want a good, hearty wine! There are so many good quality, reasonably priced wines available these days (from Chile, Argentina, S. Africa, for example) ... Why not give your customer something wonderful to enjoy with dinner?"}
{"text":"If I could give it 4.5 I would, but closer to 4 than 5 stars. First, the positives (and there were many): 1) Lobster bisque had more lobster meat than any bisque I've had in recent years, 2) both my wife's and my steak were perfectly cooked, 3) sauce on broccoli was very tasty, 4) server (I think it was Eric) was very attentive and his positive demeanor could do nothing but rub off on you, 5) garlic mashed potatoes were solid, 6) wine list-while limited, was inexpensive. Now the minuses: 1) refills on water were slow, 2) broccoli side was mushy, 3) chocolate mousse dessert had 2 of 3 great tastes, unfortunately the mousse itself was lacking (whipped cream and cake portion of dessert were phenomenal).  Would I go back - without a doubt. A definate hidden gem......"}
{"text":"Great stuff. 27$ for a thick peice of delicious prime rib with good tasting sides. And the onion soup was really good. The only reason I gave it a 4 was only because they ran out of med rare!"}
{"text":"Went last night with my family (party of 7) to celebrate my moms 60th bday..The decor  is nothing special, its exactly the same as it was 10 years ago and I am not kidding.  If I was rating strictly on my entree which was the Filet cooked meduim (which is ALWAYS what I order at any steak restuarant) I'd have to give them a 2 star.  But since everyone else ordered Prime Rib I bumped up my rating to a 4 star, and if service was the only thing I was rating then they'd get a 5 star, the busser and server were AMAZING.  Everyone's prime rib was huge and tasty looking, lots of positive feedback on the Prime Rib, vege's were Asparagus which had a sauce on them and were not crunchy and looked gray.. not fresh and green.. 1 star there.  I chose the fettucini alfredo as my side dish and it was good, 4 star.  Salads didnt come with our meals which for $28 should have so 1 star for value in my opinion, but the salad was DELISH!  Ranch was yummy and tasted homemade.  So all in all if you go and order Prime Rib and dont mind paying $5 extra for a salad then you should have a very good time.. I would not recommend the Filet, go down the road and eat at Feugos inside The Fiesta, much better and you get a salad and the vege's are fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Previously we would only stop in the Pass for the budget breakfast in the diner on the way to Boulder City. A couple of months ago, a friend told us about the Steakhouse. I never would of imagined there would be such a thing. We decided to make it our \"dress up date night\". To our surprise, it was VERY nice! The food was amazing. You really do get your money's worth too! A couple played the piano and sang making the ambience very pleasing. The best part was our waiter JUSTIN. He was very professional and showed he loved his job.   My birthday just passed, and when asked what I wanted, I replied \"let's take the family to the Steakhouse so they can have the same experience we had\". Again, another GREAT experience! The best part? JUSTIN was our waiter again! This definitely will be one of our \" nice go to places\" and one to refer to anyone!"}
{"text":"Way better than expected! I had the rib eye which was the least expensive steak at 24$ and it was very tasty.   Came with veggies and potato that was both good!  Choco cake for dessert was very yum!  They have a nice piano player and gal singer that were fun and played some good mellow music.   The decor needs a little clean up, but they try to maintain a vintage steakhouse vibe."}
{"text":"Just a friendly warning. They have changed hands and have new owners so you may not have the same experience as other reviewers. Big difference from before. First of all the players club shorted me on points which made me very angry , and I know I was not mistaken. The clerk even admitted that many people say the same thing. Also it is no longer 50 comps per person , it is now 75.  So off on a bad foot I walked on because it was my father's 75th birthday.  And down the rabbit hole we went. Nice atmosphere, nice waiter, the word nice stops here. \"Shrimp scampi\" appetizer was ridiculous, three average shrimp thrown in Alfredo sauce ( On what planet is shrimp scampi cooked in Alfredo cheese sauce?!)& it was straight out of a jar no doubt. The bread escaped from the microwave onto our table to our dismay. Sea bass under-cooked, loaded with Cajun spices that were just too much and over-powering. Lobster was chewy undesirable, steak was small and again under-cooked ( ordered medium and it came mooing...) ( Surf & Turf was 60.00). The vegetables were not fresh and raw-ish and stringy with salty sauce on them. Lobster Bisque was flour coloring salt and old lobster crumbles on top. ( shallow bowl for 10.00 too). The carrot cake was still 1/2 frozen. ( not fresh). So these 5 stars are from before the new owners folks. They are in need of some major tweeking now. Terrible experience, ruined my Father's special day. He went home hungry because nothing could be finished. The baked potato was good, I'll give them that much but they cheated... who can mess up \"nature\"....."}
{"text":"This steakhouse is a hidden secret, and is spectacular. I would recommend this steakhouse to anyone wanting fine dining at reasonable prices. This is Not a stuffy stuck up location that treats you poorly if you don't order alcohol. We had an excellent meal with great service from Steve Wilson. Thank you for an excellent meal at reasonable prices. The new york steak was excellent, as was the prime rib."}
{"text":"We have driven past Railroad Pass so many times and never suspected such a jewel of a restaurant inside. Thanks to Railroad Pass' player's card, we tried The Steakhouse at the Pass - which was incredible.  The rib eye steak was cooked perfectly and my girlfriend reported the seafood platter was unbelievable. Even the tiramisu was good (although not as coffee flavored as we're used to). The only thing I didn't care for - and this is personal preference - the kitchen adds bacon to just about everything: for me it was the salad and the risotto rice. Oh, the appetizers were incredible too, especially the sauteed portabello mushrooms. Can't forget the service, which was an A++. Don't just drive by, check this place out. Especially if you have points on your player's card!!"}
{"text":"Walked in very hungry through part of the casino. Brings back memories of Vegas with stale smoke, stale food and very weird people sitting at slot machines. Okay, expected that. Got to whom I thought was the ma√Ætre d' or host. It was a Saturday night at 7 pm so I thought it might be busy. I asked if we needed a reservation for the steakhouse and he first tried to funnel us down to the buffet. Then he asked in a suspicious tone if we were there for the 7.99 special. \"No, we are here for the prime rib,\" we say. \"Oh, I might be able to seat you,\" says he. Bit obnoxious.  We get in there and the place is almost empty. Was he fishing for a tip? Whatever. I order the lobster bisque and my husband orders the largest cut of prime rib. Five minutes later the waitress come back and says, \"I'm sorry, bad news sir. I've just been informed that we are out of prime rib.\" Really?! Out of prime rib on Saturday night at 7:00 pm ????  This messes things up since we were going to split the large cut. Now what? We order the ribeye with peppercorn sauce. Another five minutes. \"More bad news sir.\" Now if the were out of ribeye, I was leaving then and there. Nope. Out of peppercorn sauce. Fine.  The rolls were stale. The lobster bisque came. Good flavor, but the consistency was like congealed gravy. Too much thickener and no pieces of lobster. they must have used just the stock. Disappointing. Couldn't eat it.  The steak was pretty good. The garlic mashed potatoes were cold and they were missing something:  oh yeah, GARLIC!  If you think I might be nit-picky, check the other 5 reviews I've posted today. They are 5 and 4 star. I see the other reviews. Maybe this was an off night or they just got through a hoard of people, but this was not a good experience."}
