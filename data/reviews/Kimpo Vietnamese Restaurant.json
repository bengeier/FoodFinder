{"text":"kim bo here kim bo there kim bo everywhere.  it seems like everywhere you turn these days, you will see a kim bo restaurant.  correct me if i am wrong but, i do think the original one (in my opinion is still the best) is on Dundas just west of Spadina.  it was this location that started it all and still has the best fukien noodles in town.

i don't think all these new ones are associated with each other, they just share the same name.  i have been to about 6 different ones and to be honest, most them were pretty bad.

this particular location located near Kennedy & Steeles, has a pretty good version of fukien noodles but, still fall short to the original one.  this is the only dish i get here but do have to say their spring rolls are pretty good.

price wise $6.95 (small) and $7.95 (large).  not bad and meat portions are pretty decent.

will i come back... yes.  this is the only location that makes a pretty good fukien noodles north of the city."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from some friends about their noodles.  I went to try it with a girl friend of mine.  We had ordered some noodels and I asked my friend get some of those bean sprouts and lemon for the noodles.  I alwas thought that those were free but they said that there was a charge and as she walked away she mumble something.  I didn't know what she said but my friend yelled back and said what did you say.  Apparently she was talking trash about how us people eat noodles with the bean sprouts.  Long story short we ate and left.  We will never go back because their service sucks and their employees talk trash about their customers.  I thought the customers are important aren't we the ones paying for thier wages.

Bad...Bad...Bad"}
{"text":"OK so this place is kinda ghetto, the location sucks, and the pho here isn't anything to write home about, so what's up with the 4 stars?  Well... the secret is to NOT order the pho!

My go to order at every other pho restaurant is the house special, which is basically the kitchen sink pho that has everything dumped into it. At Kim Po, you need to order the Fukien style noodles in soup. That's right, I said order the Fukien noodles!

It comes with both yellow round egg noodles and vermicelli in a very light broth scented with Thai basil, coriander, and green onion. It's nothing earth shattering, but it's a nice break from the usual pho dac biet (house special pho) at a pho restaurant actually run by Vietnamnese people!"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick bite! Food arrived shortly after we ordered. If you like spicy i would recommend you order the hue soup for only $1 more. and if thats not spicy enough, they have hot pepper on the table for you. try first to see if you can take it! IT IS SPICY!

I ordered the special beef pho with hue soup. I really liked the soup! its spicy and full of flavour! Will be back to try their original soup base :)

There's limited parking spots so be prepared to park on the streets!"}
{"text":"One of the best pho spots I've been to. Their menu has quite a good selection and they have great Pho Bo, Phuc Kien noodles, and My Tho noodles, which are clear glass noodles with beef and seafood. 

The service is pretty decent and the servers can speak English Cantonese and Mandarin
The food comes out pretty quickly and tastes great! You should definitely come here but expect a wait on the weekends as this is a popular spot in the community even though it may be hidden in a sidestreet."}
{"text":"I went to Kim Po yesterday for dinner and it was my first experience there.  I ordered the house special Pho 301.  When it was brought to me I noticed a white film in the soup, something similar to cooked egg.  I was kind of concerned, but continued to eat.  Then I noticed it tasted like a mint flavour and was immediately alarmed.  It was chewed GUM in my food.  I immediately informed the waitress and she checked in the back.  She responded with \"No one was chewing gum\".  I've never experienced ANYTHING like this before and I would definitely not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A Pho restaurant inside a house?  Yep. thats what it is basically.

There was a Toronto Health sign with Conditional Pass.. but we wanted to try it anyways since crowds never lie right?

The Pho was pretty good, the place is pretty crowded, and its a definitely unique place.  Just be careful going down the stairs to the washroom.  The stairs are very very slippery.. if you fall.. you're going to get a big hurt."}
{"text":"Really good food! I love the pho and all the vietnamese appetizers. They're all made very well! I especially liked the vietnamese rolls.

The other foods like curry wasn't as good so I would only come back for the pho and appetizers. 

The service is average. The parking is a little sketchy and they don't have many spots. The restaurant isn't big so I wouldn't be going with a large group."}
{"text":"Wow, only a 3/5 for this place?!?! You've got to be kidding me. This is the best place for Viet in Scarborough, let alone all of the GTA!

I always opt for the Pho Ga. As a non-beef eater, this is always an excellent option for me. The soup base tastes like it's made from real chicken bones (as it should be), and is accentuated by the additions of fried crispy onions, and green onions. 

The Bun is to die for. I usually get the Lemongrass Chicken which is grilled over charcoal, and their super crispy fried Spring Rolls. Super nom! The Nuoc Cham is the perfect balance between salty, sweet, and sour. A little goes a long way. 

Honestly, this is better than any of the food I had when I was in Hanoi. Funnily enough, when I was in Vietnam, I kept craving Kim Po, because somehow they bring such balance of flavours to every one of their dishes.

If you live on the west end and rave about Rua Vang (Golden Turtle), forget about it. That place can't even hold a light to Kim Po. This is comfort food at it's best. One taste, and you'll have every reason you need to make the trek to the east end!"}
{"text":"The first time when I visited this restaurant, it is so good.  Not too many people but the Pho soup is clear and not much MSG and the beef is tender and of good quality.  

However the last time when I visited I am so much disappointed that I delisted it from my dining out list.  The Pho special soup has MSG that makes me very thirsty.  There is no tea or water given.  You can either order a drink or drink the soup.  The beef slices on the Pho I have never had such tough beef in a Pho soup before in any Pho restaurants.  It is not just too well done, usually the beef slices should be medium rare but the quality of the beef is not good at all.

I will not come back to this location."}
{"text":"I like their food, even better taste than Pho 88 Vietnamese Restaurant in Bamburg Circle (one block south of Steeles Ave. E. / on Warden Ave.)

Location (in Scarborough) : Doesn't seem matched with food taste but trust me. 

Washroom (downstairs) : Nice and clean.

Service : A young guy only speaks basic English (no Cantonese) but another female server speaks good Cantonese. Still, nice service.

Recommend : All kinds of food is not bad. 
Curry soup noodle (very spicy) and try Vermicelli Platter only if you like to wrap it up by yourself before enjoy !
I always ordered their hot (not iced) Viet. coffee : very strong (take times to let it difuss into the cup : Do it why enjoy your food).

Parking : 3 spots at the front and more at the back of tiny restaurant.

Overall : I will still come back."}
{"text":"Poor service - rough attitude and waited forever for the noodles; when asked politely about it, the server just a bad stare and said \"it's supposed to be this long;\" when it was time to get the bill, waited forever again with 3 servers on site and very little customers.

Poor quality  of food - the carrots in the noodles were kind of rotten; the meat in the second bowl of noodles were so little to a point that it may not even fill up a child's tummy and thin slices of fat only.

Overall - Highly not recommended; been here before and the service and quality decreases each time."}
{"text":"It's my 2nd time going to this place.  I went in yesterday around 6:30pm.  Place was serving 4 tables including ours.  Food was good.  I ordered a Grilled Chicken Mon with Spring Roll and that cost $6.75.  It's a good and cheap dinner, very filling.

Suggested area of improvement? Cleanliness.  It's not dirty in there like you're sitting in filth but at least don't open all doors and let the flies be chilling there near your head while you're eating.  It was raining yesterday, so it was extra humid and extra flies.

I just found out they have a few other franchise places, so I'll def check those out."}
{"text":"I got a curly hair in my noodle soup . It was soooo gross!!! They just took it away and gave me another without apologizing. Never coming back"}
{"text":"I recently came from a trip from Saigon Vietnam.  It was a gastronomic experience from authentic Beef Pho to Chè Ht Sen Long Nhãn. I happened to pass by Pacific Mall with my son, he would like some Pho for dinner.  This was my second time coming here after many years had passed, since it was near by mall.  I ordered their beef flank with tendon Pho, as soon my lips touch the soup I was drawn back in a space warp back from my trip in Vietnam having Beef Pho in this small restaurant with the locals.  This is as original as you can get.  It taste good, not too oily and tasty, however Kimpo have the best rice noodle compared to Vietnam or even the Pho I have in Hotel Nikko Siagon (where I stayed during my trip).  I find the rice noodles in Vietnam are really soft, however Kimpo's rice noodles are firmer and al dente.  Priced reasonable and compare to other Vietnamese restaurants around the area. I will definitely be coming back more often, its definitely much cheaper than flying over Vietnam Just for a bowl of Beef Pho."}
{"text":"I've been going to their downtown location since I was a child and since they opened one up in Scarborough/Markham, I've been coming here instead. I must say, they used to be so much better. I usually get the fuk kien noodle but noticed that the noodles aren't as good anymore so now I get the bun bo hue (bbh) but it's not even that great either - there's so much \"debris\" in the soup and the meat was so pathetic.
The service here is horrendous. The server was on his phone while taking orders, yes, I understand this is an Asian restaurant and they can do whatever the f they want but just out of respect and courtesy, put your god damn phone down for 30 seconds while you take an order.
The woman isn't any better. I always get pho noodles with my bbh instead of bun and I wrote it down on the piece of paper and gave it to him and explain it to him as well. The woman comes back and starts yelling asking me what I want. I thought I was pretty clear to them. Ahh this place completely sucks ass yet they're always packed. why."}
{"text":"Giving the ol' cow a break, I wanted to switch things up from the usual beed pho and tried a noodle soup with seafood. Not quite sure what I was expecting, maybe a spicy or otherwise potent broth but it came with a light/clear broth. The broth has a light oniony sweetness to it that was quite pleasing. It could very well have been the same as pho broth but regardless, not bad at all. Squid, fish balls, and one shrimp, as well as onion and green onion, fried shallot, bean sprouts and garlic chives rounded out the dish. Piping hot broth alone puts it above the other pho places in the area."}
{"text":"It's not what is was back in the day. The special phone that I got was sad. Back I'm the day, a small was good enough to make me really full and mouth dry. Now, I'm not even satisfied. The portions got smaller, the meat quality is eh, my biggest complaint is the broth, it just tasted like soapy water. It pains me to see a pho restaurant go down like this."}
{"text":"My dad heard this place has really good pho so my family came here for a visit. Upon arrival, I figured this place must be awesome seeing as it's located in a mildly sketchy location but still has plenty of cars parked around it. We ordered and XL pho, a viet spring roll, and shrimp w/ sugar cane. I thought the food was pretty standard, but nothing exceptional in my opinion. I think I would only return if convenient, but certainly not a pho place I would go out of my way to get to."}
{"text":"There are many Kim po locations and this review is only for this location as the one on woodbine shouldn't even be called a Kim po

The broth from their pho here is one of the best in the city! And I have been to well over 25-30 pho restaurants in Toronto alone! The broth is just perfect not too sweet and does not have a lot of MSG which I can not stand! They also have one of the best bbh in the city! Small ish place not too too many seats I have had to wait before mostly on Sundays when I'm super hungover ! 
The meat does change from day to day, that is their rare beef I mean, some times it's super fatty and I just can't stomach it. I also love the fact that they have sliced hot peppers at each table ( if they don't just ask for it) the Large I find is the perfect size as the XL is bigger then the steelies on my first mazda... Don't even try it by ur self, at least not hungover! 
I have been coming here once a week for at least 5 months now, and will keep coming back for that broth! #crack"}
{"text":"Kimpo is a small hidden Viet restaurant in a standalone building beside the Milliken Go Station parking lot. There are many reasons why this is our favourite pho joint in Markham. Their broths, both chicken and beef, are complex, with fried crunchy garnishes that add another layer of flavor. And the best part? We don't feel thirsty after the meal!  

I have been cutting out red meat from my diet, and there are not too many places that serve good chicken pho. This is definitely one of them, the chicken is not too dry and they are not stingy on the portion ($7.95 - small). I really like the fact that they use fresh flat rice noodles, instead of dried noodles like many other pho places.

My husband usually gets the rare beef pho ($7.95 - small), which comes with thinner rice noodles, and tender slices of meat.  

One of the things we absolutely love about this place is the soup is served piping hot, which allows the bean sprouts and herbs to cook nicely. 

This time, we also ordered the spring rolls ($5.95), which in my opinion had too much taro in them. However, my husband enjoyed it. The spring rolls came with a small side of noodles, carrots, bean sprouts and peanuts with a tasty fish sauce that is more on the sweet side. Overall, there is a lot to love here, with its simple, tasty and cheap options! Remember to bring cash though, as they do not accept other methods of payment."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  We came during the heat of the Sunday lunch hour and had to wait a little for our group of six.  Not a huge deal and to be expected.  Service though was spotty at best.  First 2 teas came... then we had to ask twice more for tea for the rest of us.  Between the 6 of us, we had pho, and vermicelli in varying sizes with huge gaps in between when they all arrived.  The shakes were appropriately thick.  However, at least one of them arrived when we were already finished the food.

There was a weird taste to the meat in my pho - not fresh tasting at all - beefy, but in all the wrong ways.  There were some weird looking tendons that just looked gross.  I had a small but didn't end up finishing it like I usually do and felt a bit nauseous towards the end.  *shudder*  I would not go back to this little house of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Parking is rather tough here since this tiny stand alone restaurant resides along a small street across from Pacific Mall so beware of coming at peak lunch/dinner hours.. especially on weekends!

I've been here a few times and I've had conflicted feelings because there were both dishes that were super delicious that really stood out as well as dishes that were shamefully bad that I would never order again. Overall though, this restaurant is fairly consistent with their food so I'm perfectly content with coming back just to order the same Tracy-approved dish over and over again! So without further ado:
 
Would recommend = crab meat thick rice noodle soup (and then switch out the thick noodles for regular pho noodles) because the flavour of the soup is so rich and savoury. There are no \"real\" chunks of crab but there's a generous amount of substitution meat. I normally switch out the noodles purely out of preference because the thick ones are too slimy and chewy in my opinion. 

Would not recommend = seafood pineapple fried rice because it's just downright disgraceful. The rice is simply stir fried in salt - which makes the dish lack colour overall. Then, I'm almost certain that they use canned pineapples soaked in water because when you bite into it, you literally taste nothing - just a burst of warm water. Gross.

As the food here is priced reasonably, I would recommend you try this place out if you're in the area and looking for Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"My favorite is the Fukin Style noodle! It contains yellow egg noodle and vermicelli noodle with some sort of sweet meat, cooked sprouts and green onions. It is very different and best of all it comes with a prawn chip! It is the size of an appetizer plate with a prawn head in the middle. I dip it into the broth, soak it for a bit and eat it. Needless to say more, it is very delicious. 

Although I have had a very bad experience there. I tried reserving 6 seats but they won't let us because our other 3 friends were running late. They gave it away but the food was still good - unable to sit with my other friends. Therefore, the ones who have eaten there for over two years will know and understand the turnover rate. Good thing, since the summer, the servers who were loud and rude does not work there anymore."}
{"text":"Parking is always a hassle here but that doesn't stop me coming to eat here though! Been coming here couple of times. I usually like to order their banh canh cua which suppose to have chunks of crab in it but they substitute it with meat instead and has thick tapioca noodles. The last time I ate this dish - their noodles weren't really fully cooked (not translucent) so I had to pick some out. 

Today I went back and decided to try a different dish and I've been also craving for some bun or noodle salad. I ordered the bun cha gio nam nuong which contains a roll of spring rolls and Vietnamese sausage. Holy crap they were so generous with the meat portion!! The portion size was alot bigger than I thought so double the awesome! The nem nuong tasted great - I like that it has some bits and pieces of black pepper but I personally would like if it also taste a bit sweeter since they usually taste salty and sweet :) I definitely would continue to come back here and try different dishes. 

Took out a star because while me and my partner were waiting for the food to arrive, there were spiders crawling around near the condiments, yikes."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pho and reasonable priced! Kind of hidden in a corner near intersection Steeles and Kennedy. It seems to be a cute family business, all the staff are very friendly and provide great service. 

Def stop by if you are in the Pacific Mall area and is craving some pho!"}
{"text":"It was an A-OK pho place to me. But since I'm only into noddles, I never ordered the other food which some yelpers complimented. To me this place is when I crave for pho or noodle in soup and I'm too lazy to go to far. I don't really like the spring roll cause there's taro in it, but it's just me. In general it's not too bad and it's always busy. We waited in line for almost 10 minutes on a Sunday at 2pm."}
{"text":"Although the soup for the pho is still one of the best, we don't come here at all anymore. They put all their prices up AND their portions are ridiculously small. The meat on the lemon grass pork chop rice is laughable. We got 2 tiny thin slivers, the last time we went. Not good for a plate of rice over $8. Pho is all soup now and not much noodles. They're really busy from all the young Mandarin speakers that frequent the place now, so you still need to queue up for a table. Needless to say, we haven't been since the rice incident. Such a shame because I loved their pho soup."}
{"text":"Best pho in markham by far. service is great. definetly deserves more than 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Very nice pho place to go to but very hard to find. They only accept cash, which is so inconvenient. They offer free wifi so you can eat by yourself while watching so Netflix. The place is pretty small and loud."}
{"text":"As an after-dinner snack, I decided to finally go to Kim Po as I keep hearing that Pho is a typical street vendor snack in Vietnam so I will treat it as such and go according to that intent. 

As I walked inside an hour prior to closing time, there were a couple of tables occupied and one was actually the waitresses having their meal while one of them stood, held a Menu, looked at me while I looked back. It was our MOMENT, never forget that. 2.5 *Star* 

As I chose a seat, I looked at the Menu still trying to figure out which Language I should request my order as she never spoke still. They spoke Vietnamese amongst themselves, unfortunately I'm not fluent except for Pho, Bun, Ca, or Cha. 

House Special Pho($6.99/Large) was my snack of choice as if I chose small, I should of went home and drank water instead. I decided to order in English and the elder waitress nodded, then in 5 seconds she plated a bowl in front of me. Now that is SERVICE! 

She came back in another 1 minute and took it away to the next table as it was their House Special Vermicelli instead. She then spoke Cantonese to say sorry to me as I was about to dig in. She forget that I was the one that ordered Pho from her just seconds ago?? 

Another minute after my Pho arrives in Large format. As reviewed before, the Pho had good stock while Meat quantity and quality I'm satisfied with UNTIL I had the TENDON. That Ghost White Mushy Tendon is just not something I would come back for, ever. 

SKIP the Tendon and get used to the weird Service, then you'll have an average meal."}
{"text":"Best place to get late night pho! Prices are very reasonable and service is great. I ordered the rare beef with tripe and I would definitely recommend that dish to anyone who likes a good beef broth soup."}
{"text":"There is so many Pho restaurants in the GTA these days. Some are very good and others you wonder how they can stay in business.  But one thing that is hard to find in Pho restaurants is consistency especially in the most important element, the broth. As one can image different restaurants obviously have different broth but I find often times even in the same restaurant the soup is different almost every time. That is probably because they don't use exact measurements in their recipes. I have eaten Pho in many parts of North America and in Asia. This one is good. I find the soup is consistently good. With deep natural umami flavor from the hours of bones stewing sway in the soup (but I am sure some MSG is used too). There are options to customize your pho like dry pho noodles or fresh pho noodles. Noodles in soup and dry noodles with soup on the side. 
Also important is having condiments like vinegar garlic sauce and sliced chili's on each table, reminiscent of Pho in Vietnam.
Oh ya, they have other standard Vietnamese items on the menu too but frankly who really cares, it's all about the pho isn't it? 
These guys have been here a long time and know what they are doing. Check it out."}
{"text":"Close pho place across pacific mall. I love coming here at least once a month. It is a quiet area and often gets packed at dinner time. It's a quick bite, so generally I would not have to wait more than 5 minutes. The pho here is more authentic and savoury. I would recommend the special beef noodle or the Kim po special which comes with the rice chip. The Kim Po special is so unique not any one restaurant carries this dish. It is a chicken broth with mixed egg noodles and vermicelli with various types of pork meat it in. I love ordering that all the time. Def would recommend trying it if you want to try something new! P.s bring cash because they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Also a great example of don't judge a book by it's cover, in this case, a restaurant! 

Kimpo Vietnamese Restaurant is located South of Steeles right across Pacific Mall+Market Village. At the lights, most people either turn left or right to go east or west on Steeles, but if you continue straight - right to the Miliken GO Station Parking Lot, you will see it! It looks like an old wooden shack, with basically no parking. 

When you enter inside, everything is decently decorated on the inside, the menu is in both English and Chinese. There are MANY types of pho and noodle types you can order here, the broth is steaming hot every time! The spring rolls were delicious at $5.99 for 2 spring rolls (yes, more pricey than outside, but I thought it was DELICIOUS). The lemongrass rice with pork and beef were a little small compared to other places (perhaps the plate was just extra HUMONGOUS that the food looked like it was a smaller portion).

All in all, great place to eat, come early because Kimpo fills up really quickly at night!"}
{"text":"Large servings, good price, always piping hot.

A small, busy place, cleanliness is a bit of issue for me, as I always see flies around.. eek!

Servers can barely speak English, but good that they will give you a piece of paper to write your order down.

Prices are cheap and one thing I love about this place is their HUGE serving! A small is more of a medium and their medium is more of a large. Imagine how their XL bows look like??

Food is very tasty, a bit on the salty side, but they do put a lot of meat, like I mentioned earlier, servings are huge.

Service is also fast as they always have multiple servers, unlike their competitor Pho Viet, where I used to go to before."}
{"text":"I came here with my family without reading the reviews.  Haha, looks like we dodged a bullet by not having to go to the bathroom!  But that aside, I thought this was a perfectly typical high-turnover, inexpensive Vietnamese restaurant.  The food was yummy, it wasn't too expensive ($12-$15/person and we had a lot), and I didn't have high expectations for ambience or service so it didn't disappoint.  One guy did make a big scene - I only caught him yelling loudly about how rude the server was as he stormed out of the restaurant.  Sure, they don't really acknowledge you when you flag them down or speak to them (but the food came out right and they always did come back with tea, so who am I to complain). We ordered the imperial rolls, the grilled pork with rice, the combination beef pho, shrimp and sugar cane, Vietnamese coffee, red bean drink, and another noodle dish with tomato.  Everything was good."}
{"text":"Favourite pho place. Hands down. Have my favourite fresh rolls that I love. I always order small pho and service is very quick. Their drinks are very good as well. Just overall deliciousness. I crave their food."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a good friend of mine and we went here for pho.  It is definitely one of the best pho I've had in Toronto.  I got the pho tai and spring rolls. I would definitely return.

Update: returned here with the family and they thought it was the best pho in the GTA.

Food: 4/5, the broth was piping hot and flavourful. The noodles were done just right and the shaved meat were very tender.

Service: 3/5, nice people working but like most pho places, you only see them once during the ordering and when you pay.

Ambience: 3/5, we went on a very cold day and the restaurant was also cold inside. It's a little grungy but still a nice little place.

Price: 2/5, about $15 per person with appetizers.  Quite affordable. But they just take cash which wasn't great"}
{"text":"A nice small Pho restaurant located near Pacific Mall, my friends and I came here to eat dinner. It was quite busy when we arrived and because the restaurant is quite small, there is limited seating. I ordered a large special and a cold Hong Kong style milk. The food came out pretty quickly. As I was drinking my cold HK Milk Tea, I noticed there was a bug in my drink. I immediately called the waitress over and pointed that out. She was quick to respond to the fact that can. She didn't really offer an apology but got me a new drink relatively quickly. I was hoping she would offer the drink as a complimentary one but that didn't happen when it came to paying for the bill. Make sure you bring cash as this place only takes cash. Prices are cheap and they are generous with their portions and meat. Despite the minor incident here, the food here is average and the service was alright. I am a little bit concerned about the cleanliness about the place but would return for the decent pho."}
{"text":"I traveled to Canada couple times now. Every time I am here, my family often takes me to this place for some traditional Vietnamese/Chinese dishes. The food quality has been up and down, but the customer service is BAD straight up!
The most terrible experience happened recently when our whole family (8 people) came in for lunch. The food ordering styles here are self service, you put down the food and drink that you'd like to order and hand that tiny piece of paper to the server after you are done.
There was only 1 server in the ENTIRE RESTAURANT, (the restaurant was quite crowded during lunch time). After we finished putting down our food and drinks orders, the server came and took a glance at our orders. After looking at our orders, he gave us a cold comment (in Chinese) on our drink orders, \"NO! NO! NO! NO!\", and then turned around and left. 
My family looked at each other with the surprised looks (in a bad way) and confused. So non of the drinks that we ordered were available. He could have said something more polite since the restaurant did not have any items that we ordered. Instead, he did not bother to say apologize or any other words besides \"No\" and left us there for 15 minutes. 
Finally he came back and took our orders (Thanks God!)
Still, not saying a word or a smile on the face. We patiently waited for 30 minutes to get served. All of us felt like, we came here to beg for food, not coming here to enjoy our lunch with our loved ones.
Overall, I cannot force myself eating good food (not even that good actually), and stand/tolerate such horrible service. Definitely not recommend to anyone, do not see myself coming back here!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, service is beyond ridiculous. Waitress just don't greet you. When u r ready to order, they will walk by and threw a pen and piece of paper tell u \"write it down yourself\" without even looking at u with the most harsh tone of voice as if u murdered her entire family. We will never go back again."}
{"text":"Still love the taste of their My Tho Noodle the broth is still the best. Portions have come down prices probably up but when I need fix this is my go too.  
Looks like they did some minor interior alterations to the seating looks cleaner too."}

Ah well, i went to lunch here with a buddy today and the food is still on par as before.  I believe they painted the inside and it looks cleaner.  Even the staff was nicer than before LOL

i always order #204 and add the garlic vinaigrette and chili paste. LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"whenever i am looking pho PHO this is one of the local places I'd recommend.  Right across from the NEVER ENDING, BUSY-AS-HELL Pacific Mall & Market vILLAGE.

This place is tucked away, and if you drive by this place, you wouldn't even know its there.  But nonetheless its  place to try for those who have never tried PHO...which is pronounced (Faah)  Their prices are reasonable and the food flies out fast! 
I would recommend their all in one PHO bowl, as well Porkchop with rice, and veggies.  
overall this place is a 3/5"}
{"text":"This place was my go to pho restaurant. Today I noticed that the quality has gone down. The soup tasted watered down and the noodles were overcooked. 

The flavour is still good, but I would consider my other options before deciding to come here again."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this location of Kim Po. 

I came here today with a friend for lunch. Considering the fact that I saw this Kim Po was related to the one at Times Square (Richmond Hill) I was expecting the same service and similar food but this was super disappointing. I ordered the sour chicken soup without any noodles. By the time I was almost finished, there was a huge piece of plastic in my soup. 

I called the waiter over, he saw the plastic and told the female waitress to come over as she was the one who initially took my order. I asked her why is that in there?

She said: \"Oh! its just a piece of plastic...then goes on explaining how it got in there\"....seriously..I don't need to know that how it got in there...I just need to know if you're gonna do anything about it...No apology/ No 10% discount / and just walked away was what I got...I was quite shocked...and disappointed at the same time...

I asked for hot tea/ I get cold tea....

This place was just wrong from beginning to end..."}
{"text":"Before the meal even started, the napkin had a black stain on the bottom which made me do a double take. Ordered a bowl of beef noodle soup with roasted/pan fried pork. The middle soup was ordinary run of the mill stuff and would get three stars in my books, but the pork was disastrous. It was so charred that I could not finish half of it (see picture). How is it okay to serve pork like this?

Maybe it is three stars for noodle soups, but do not order the toasted/pan fried meats."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 3/5 nothing special, good for a quick lunch or dinner

Food : 4.5/5
My go to place for Bun Bo Hue (Hue style spicy noodles)

Service: pretty quick!"}
{"text":"I love the Kim Po location in Chinatown, but sometimes it's a bit of drive, especially from Markham, therefore I have to satisfy my cravings elsewhere. Thankfully, there are many different Kim Po locations closer to me, however I don't believe they are the same in anyway other than the fact that they have the same name and they serve similar items on the menu. 

I've recently been going to this location, located right across Pacific Mall very often, and their food certainly does not disappoint. Although it looks pretty run down from the outside with little to no parking space, the interior is much better. They don't have a lot of seating, and it does get cramped when busy. 

My go-to item is definitely the Fuk Kien Noodles, which come with a Shrimp Cracker. The Chinatown location is the OG, and in terms of the flavor of the broth, this Kim Po is certainly up there in the big leagues. By default, they serve two kinds of noodles, rice noodle and thick yellow noodles, however for many years my dad has been asking to substitute the yellow noodles for Ho Fun (Thick Rice Noodles), which is definitely a game changer. They add more meat in the noodle soup compared to the one downtown, which is a bonus, because it's so soft and ohh so tender! We've explored other parts of their menu and had the Pho, Lemongrass Chicken with Rice as well as the Spring Roll Vermicelli which are pretty good and authentic as well! I would totally recommend this place as its decently priced, and the quality is there."}
{"text":"I love me some delicious pho and the broth in the special noodle soup is amazing! Good food for great price. The parking is a little cumbersome but if you're not going during the busy lunch hour, not too bad."}
{"text":"My go to place for pho (I only eat the rare beef)! The broth is amazing and the meat is just right. Usually the pho restaurants I've been too gives you too little and often a bit dry, but not here.

The only issue I've had here was the one time they gave me the thick noodles without asking."}
{"text":"I usually come here for a quick fixing of pho; definitely my top choice for pho in the city. There's something about the broth that brings me back each time.

Also had a Vietnamese iced coffee, which was very refreshing!"}
{"text":"Just went to Kim Bo for lunch a few weeks ago
.  
Good - the sitting area is clean.  The noodle I got tasted good with sufficient chicken.  The portion was big (OR too big for a girl).  The price was reasonable.

Bad - I parked my car at the rear parking lot.  It smelled there.  I knew right away that, despite the cleanliness of the store front, the kitchen and garbage area was dirty and had been for a while.  I went to washroom after meal, and the ladies room had a funny smell.  Oh, I suspect the store owner either fixed the storage shed at the back himself, or he got a friend to, because it was a make shift storage shed (hint - look at the roof).  I am not sure how it has passed the building code.

I have been to other Kim Bo's.  I like the one on Woodbine Avenue better and it is cleaner."}
{"text":"The first time I was here with my bf, I enjoyed the pho but found the service lacking.  The waitresses ignored us several times before they noticed that we wanted our bill.   

The second time, the waitress left me my change and then another one came by 5 seconds later and took the money without consulting me...I didn't even remove my change yet so as a result, she got a 50% tip without my permission.  

Overall, food is good but the staff could be better"}
{"text":"Great price and portions! Definitely an underrated location, kind of hidden (near pacific mall). Quick and friendly service. A must-try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love the crab meat noodle here. It's a thick rice noodle that's a bit chewy and clear in consistency. They also renovated and have a wall at the entrance now. Seems like they can sit more ppl. 

Go to Viet restaurant in Markham"}
{"text":"I really wonder why this place as a Conditional Pass...oh well.

The person below me summed it quite well. Ghetto place, location sucking, and pho is meh. However, as I keep saying, a true Vietnamese restaurant needs to be more diverse, not just concentrating on Pho. Bring on the 5 stars.

Beef brisket in tomato soup. Spicy beef vermicelli. Fukien style noodles. These are the three noodle soup kings I highly recommend anyone to order. The taste is out of this world. Literally. Top it off with either a iced lemon tea or a vietnam iced coffee. Then you'll have yourself the dinner of your lives."}
{"text":"I got the house special. The broth was a little bit too salty and I found myself very thirsty for the rest of the night. The portions were lower than average, especially for a L-size-- the meat slices were not generous. Other than that, there was not a long wait time for our meals to arrive.

In terms of service, the servers didn't seem to understand a lot of English. We asked for sriracha sauce but I don't think they know what we meant. The female server seemed mad/displeased because she slammed the cups of water on our table as she put it down (probably a long day for her, but what a first impression!).

Overall, I would come back here again, but I probably wouldn't get the same thing I got because I have a deep aversion to salty broth."}
{"text":"Worst customer experience I have ever encountered. Here is the breakdown of events:

Order drinks, spring rolls, noodles.
Wait patiently while everyone, including later patrons, get served. 
Inquire about where our order is - told to keep waiting by server. 
Eventually ask to cancel order as we had to get going - told by server to tell manager directly in fear of getting scolded. 
Inform manager of situation and manager rudely tells us that we have to keep waiting.
Tell manager that we need to go and cannot wait any longer (40 mins have elapsed).
Manager demands we pay for drinks because they are already made - we comply.
Pay for \"prepared\" drinks and then watch as MANAGER PREPARES DRINKS.

Needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant may look run down from the outside but the inside is fairly clean. What surprised me the most was that the washroom was very clean! Those of you who goes to Chinese restaurants know what I mean.

The food here is good. To me, it's just like any other Vietnamese restaurant. So if you are near this area and craving for some Viet food, don't be afraid of the exterior of this restaurant and give this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"Why is the rating so low??  Kim Bo is probably my favourite place for vietnamese soup noodles.  My usual orders are the chicken salad, pho, the fukienese noodles, and the tom yum pho.  The broth is very hearty and beefy.  The noodles are always cooked to the right consistency (they are the thin kind) with the perfect noodle-broth ratio.  Portions are very large here, so I usually get a small.  The cuts of meat are substantial; I especially like how the brisket is cut a bit thicker than other places.  Their other specialty is the fuckienese noodles (the one that have a mix of thick egg noodles and vermicelli).  It has a sweeter broth and comes with a yummy shrimp cracker that's yummy on its own or soaked in the broth.  After having Kim Bo, I find myself using this place as a standard that I compare all other pho places to.

If you go there and are not in the mood of souply noodes, then the Bun section is probably the best bet.  The vermicelli with the mixture of greens and fish sauce is very refreshing.  The topping like grilled meat and spring rolls are very flavourful.  I had one of their rice platters once and it was just \"meh\".  The grilled meat was not saucy so the whole plate was just kind of \"dry\" for me but that's just my weird personal perference.

*  On a side note, the soup noodles here are MIRACLES for a hangover.  Every time I wake up from a heavy night of drinking, I find myself craving Kim Bo and it cures me right away!!"}
{"text":"my holy grail vietnamese restaurant in toronto! i cannot stop advertising this place to everyoneeeee i know. they NEVER disappoint me. my go tos are 202 and 303! their soup always comes piping hot and tastes like its been brewing for the past 96 hours. there are so many dimensions of flavours within the soup that i cannot find anywhere else! i especially love their minced garlic condiment that you can add to your noodles cause noone can ever have enough garlic!

ps. they are cash only. of course."}
{"text":"I always loved the thin noodles here and the yummy flavorful soup :). I usually order the house special pho with some chicken rolls but I've tried their rice dishes and they're pretty good too! 

I especially like the fact that they have those hot peppers available as stuff for you to add into your noodles. I gotta say that it's really rare to find :p. 

service, food and prices are all great!
However there's usually a wait, they only have a small parking lot at the back which sometimes makes it difficult to park and there aren't that many tables inside (hence the wait). Other than that I really like this place :)"}
{"text":"Small Vietnamese place across Pmall. Parking is a bit of a challenge. This place had recently undergone  a renovation making the interior cleaner and updated.contrary to the interior the food  tastes the same . Lemongrass porkchop and Chicken tasted okay . Spring Rolls was so-so for me (definitely your able to find better ones). The hot chili paste on the table was probably the highlight for me , definitely has kick."}
{"text":"This is one of the best vietnamese restaurant I have in Toronto.  My mom voted it as her best.  Try their curry beef brisket, it's good!  Better go there early in order to avoid lineup.  Only one thing I hate about this restaurant is too many flies flying around......."}
{"text":"I frequent this place once in a while.  The soup base for the noodle is good.  I used to love the curry beef brisket, the chicken was nice too.  But since about half a year back, we tried it on two separate occasions it tasted different... Not as good any more, did the chef change?  Haven't tried it again since.  I've been guessing if they sold the operation.  The drinks are hit and miss, one time we ordered the avocado, and it is raw, hence very bitter.  They shouldn't have served it.  I understand these are seasonal fruits, but if there is no more of such fruits available they could have just advised us, and provided us with alternatives.

4 star for the soup base.
3 Star for the service and décor"}
{"text":"The thing that bothers me the most is how they've diluted the hot sauce and hoisin sauce to the point that it's practically water. The noodles were overcooked. The server on the other hand was really nice and attentive. 

I remember back when Kim Po used to be my favourite pho place in Markham."}
{"text":"This is another example that even restaurants have the same name under the same franchise in the same city,  the quality of the food can be quite different!

This location of Kim Po restaurant is right across Market Village tucked in behind some construction site. 

The restaurant is small. The tables are tucked closely together.  And it can be quite chilly from the drift outside in winter if you sit in the middle of the restaurant.

This place is quite busy in the afternoon since there are constantly people coming in but luckily people are leaving quickly too since the services is fast and you really can finish your meal in less than 15/20 minutes!

Since there is no lunch specials so I order the Special House Pho Large ($6.95). Why I want to order a large? since they only has 3 sizes S/L/XL, and since with my last few outing I am always hungry after eating my medium Pho..I just want to be satisfy...not to have that empty feeling of \"I am still hungry\"!

When my Pho arrived, yes this Pho size Large is a Large. There are tons of meat, tons of noodles and I barely finished it! (I am FULL! I am HAPPY!) The broth is really clear, just prefect tasting, not too salty, rich in flavour and did not make me thirsty after I finished eating and drinking it! The noodles though is dried but is cooked prefectly! The meat are good cut, though is not as lean but has the balance of fat and lean in it and it makes the meat all so tender.

I also has an iced vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. I just drank that as a dessert... oh so yummy, oh so strong! 

There are also tons of condiments on the table for you to use.

There are no cheesy or loud music/songs of any languages, just the sound of people making noises when they eating their noodles.. 

I want to be back and try out other noodles with spicy broth and the wide selections of noodles soup!

Cash Only!

(I am still full 2 hours after eating my Pho!)"}
{"text":"Came here with a number of friends.  I won't comment on the parking spaces nearby, (though I do consider it a part of the experience), but I must admit the food wasn't nearly as good as I expected.  The decor isn't pleasant either, looked a little crummy.  The staff were very friendly though, had good smiles on their faces as they greeted guests (which gave it a huge portion of its points).

Unfortunately, they took our orders and forgot to include my selection.  After half an hour of waiting, I inquired about my order.  No apology was given, they simply told me as it is.  I had to wait another 15 minutes before I got my order of the house special.

The soup was very salty.  I mean, VERY salty.  I must have downed an entire teapot of tea to try to counteract the saltiness.  The portions were also much smaller than I expected. 

I probably wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Kim Po is my favorite pho place of all time. I always order their curry beef pho and it never fails. I've tried their other dishes and those were enjoyable as well. 

I did not give it a 5 star because my friends and i were not happy with the cleanliness of the restaurant. We've been there at least 15 times and we've seen a lot, from spiders to hair and even food poisoning."}
{"text":"My family and I usually get take out from this place. We usually get the house special Phuc Kein noodles, which consists of rice and egg noodles, and a shrimp cracker :) 
When we take it home they have everything separated, so all you have to do it put it together! The portions aren't too bad for take out! 

Friday evening, I came here with my family around 6 pm. we ordered 1 Phuc Kein noodles, 1 my tho noodle soup, and 2 KimPo noodle and rice noodles. 
Everything was great, portions were decent. The my tho, although I ordered the large, it seems a bit small. But the KimPo small is huge! Hahaha. Well, it s a decent and fast restaurant!

 Side note, they use msg, and also, pork fat :P"}
