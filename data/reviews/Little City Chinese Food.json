{"text":"Ordered some delivery tonight and it was delicious!! Large portions and quick delivery. If you're looking for good western style Chinese food, look no further as you've found it. The delivery driver was fast and very friendly too. All around great service and food at a great price !!!"}
{"text":"Ordered here for years when we lived in the area. Great for western Chinese dishes. Good ginger beef!"}
{"text":"Ordered here and was told it would take 35 minutes. Showed up and it took an additional 30 minutes with poor customer service. I was not even greeted or given any information. Order finally was ready when I was about to leave. When we got home the food was extremely underwhelming. Equal to a mall food court.... There wasn't even meat in our chicken chow mein. Would never go back given all the other options on Centre Street. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"FYI.. This place is a takeout spot only.. There are no chairs or tables to eat at. You just order at the counter, and then sit in a rather office-like atmosphere and peruse maagzines while you wait for your food to be ready.

The food is great, is ready in 10-15 minutes, and is very reasonably priced. We got the chowmein and the salt n pepper eggplant and they were both DELICIOUS.

So easy to get to too!"}
{"text":"Pretty run of the mill Chinese food. Not bad by all means but far from mind blowing. Good choice for those who like \"Western \" garden variety food. Price was so, so."}
{"text":"Ordered szechuan shrimp today. Although it was tasty it lacked actual shrimp! I think in the whole serving there was only about 6 shrimp! Will not order that from there again. Disappointed little city you can do better!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent inexpensive noodle and Chinese take out place. Never tried the \"American\" Chinese dishes, so I can't assess, but I did grab some typical Chinese mainstays (Cantonese chow mein, beef fried ho-fun noodle) and they were decent and quite generous.

It's a pretty sparse and unassuming shop that's takeout and delivery only. But as such, they can afford to charge lower as they don't have the overhead costs as well. They've been around for quite awhile, so in a town where restaurants can literally open and close within a year, that says a lot."}
