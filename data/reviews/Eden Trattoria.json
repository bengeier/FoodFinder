{"text":"I live in the building above this restaurant.  I've been there twice.  Both times, for the location.  The pasta here is so devastatingly mediocre, I almost cried.  The first time, I was just happy to have a restaurant in my neighbourhood.  I didn't even expect much, so when the food turned out so disappointing, I was crushed.  But location can't be beat, especially in the summer, when the area is bustling with activity and you can sit in the sun.  So, the food is bleh, whatever, it happens. The reason I'm posting a review at all, is because I went into the *most charming* bakery that opened next door today and found that they are having to petition to keep their patio open because Eden put in a complaint to the condo board.    Now, having lived in the area for 2 years, I've been waiting to see some shops flourish here-- pet stores and convenience stores have come and gone.  There is construction for 2 more condos and am sure there will be more in the future.  There will be more businesses - yes, restaurants too- that will come here, so they better get used to it.  I just don't get that kind of pettiness.  They could be supportive, after all Eden serves full meals and Cocoa is a bakery/cafe.  And the patios outside make for such good ambiance.   Variety and competition never hurt businesses.  Maybe Eden will work a little harder to serve some decent food.  1 star for location.  1 star for patio.  Minus 3 stars for food that doesn't do the restaurant justice and poor sportsmanship.  --------------------------  May 18, 2011 Received email from Mark the manager.  Says they're not to blame for the bakery's patio troubles.  I've moved to Vancouver and don't know what's going on there now, but thought it's really nice of him to address it.  Also says Eden can't please everyone's palate.  That's true, although I am definitely no food critic ... Their food's isn't awful, it's just okay.  Anyway, it's nice that they care.  Added a star for people who care!"}
{"text":"wow what a great place, i did not like their minestrone soup but everything else was brilliant, oven baked fish, fresh mussels in wine sauce, real chocolate gelato, and although their cakes are not made in house they order it from a factory this cake was different from any you find in cafes... this was so light, white chocolate mousse kind of cake, i cant wait 2 eat it again. their prices r not too bad compared to the high rent they pay i assume... $85 at lunch time  for 2 including 20% tip (places like this require 20%) service was friendly!!! their menu is the same for lunch and the dinner so probably it is a better choice to go in the evening if you plan to have a romantic dining experience and fun with ur partner( spending around this amount is a bit too much for just a lunch but the food is really special...) it was fully packed, people had to wait outside, we went there around 4 pm, yes it was bit noisy as tables are very close to each other, but it was still nice to sit outside in the calming breeze watching the lake shore"}
{"text":"Great view, but the food leaves me a little unimpressed.   Nothing offensively bad, but maybe that's the problem, I think they might not be willing to be adventurous in their seasoning, etc. so you're left with something bland.  I've been here at least twice."}
{"text":"Liked the calamari with panko delicious! Went back twice for that. Pizza not a big fan of. Gorgeous view of waterfront!"}
{"text":"Platter sizes got smaller and the service has no smiling face with a tense attitude. On the other hand,  the atmosphere gives you a cold feeling and they are playing far eastern music in an Italian restaurant which is pretty odd.  Only the good thing about the place is, it is beside the lake and it has a great city and lake view. As I noticed If you live in Parklawn you have few choices and I hope there will be more options for the people who live there."}
{"text":"This place is alright. The service is always good but for the kind of food you get the pricing is wayyyy to expensive.  There is never anything particularly wrong with the food, but it seems like not a lot of effort or thought goes into the end result, or at least not enough to justify the prices. I still go there because there is actually nothing else in the area. Definitely over valued."}
{"text":"went again. so sorry i did.The location is great, the food really sucks. The need to revisit the menu and the wine list. gold mine if they could just get it right!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location, shame about the food and the wait staff's manners. The calamari was limp and the pizza burnt. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is just one of those great places that you carry on going to over & over again. From the first time we went to this place when my daughter was 6months old (She is now 2 yrs) we haven't stopped going. The service is incredible and I have nothing to complain about. They make amazing panini's to mention my favorite is the Brie & Avocado..........Yummy & they also have a great WINE Selection and we have never been disappointed with our choices by the glass or bottle.  If you are ever in the Lakeshore West Area STOP IN and you won't be disappointed.........."}
{"text":"Expected much more from this place given the location and price.  The house salad was awful and they had no dressing choices other than raspberry vinaigrette.  They expect you to season your own with the oil and vinegar on the table - really?!   The 4 cheese gnocchi was very very very bland.  On the plus side, the restaurant itself has a nice vibe and it's in a great location.  Might be best for a drink on the patio.  I definitely wouldn't go back for food."}
{"text":"I'm going to start this post by saying that I've eaten at Eden's at least 30+ times in the past few years, not including our bi-weekly take-out orders.  Eden is good. The restaurant itself is the nicest part - a beautiful interior and a nice patio. With very few restaurants to choose from in Etobicoke that aren't chains, Eden takes the top spot for quality of food, location, and price.   The service is hit or miss - I try to avoid restaurants in general around 6-8, but I've encountered a number of servers here that consistently forget to bring your bill - water - change - or absolutely disappear for 15 minutes at a time. However, I've also had exceptional service here.  The atmosphere is, for the most part, great. You get a few d-bags and 35 year old club-goers that live in the condos that love to screech at the top of their lungs about their friend with a Ferrari or their new Michael Kors bag -- two days ago a woman tied up her dog to the patio fence and ignored it after it threw up all over the ground/stepped in it/ate it etc... totally bizarre and gross.  The food is consistently good. Large portions for the most part matched with reasonable prices. I've never had to send anything back. Very pleased with their breakfast.  Realistically Eden probably only deserves 3 stars, but considering Toronto's general lack of quality restaurants and my loyalty to their mashed potatoes & fried calamari they get 4. The best part about Eden is that you can go for any occasion - breakfast with the girls, for lunch after roller blading, on a first date, for a birthday, with family... which is why Eden continues to be our first choice for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Above average view with very \"meh\" like food.  Went for brunch here with the family and was extremely underwhelmed.  When it comes to Italian food in this city, I have very high standards since Toronto has such a strong Italian community with very good food.    The restaurant has a very modern and contemporary feel to it.  The place has a nice chocolate brown interior with beige walls.  The desserts are well displayed (and look delicious) but the gelato was closed.  The view is great.  You are literally on the other side of the Trail that leads into downtown Toronto and have a great view of the waterfront.  I can totally see sitting out here on a warm summer evening having a drink and taking in the view of the city as it gets darker.    The two stars?...That was only for the view and the dining facilities.    Now onto the food...  I ordered the veal sandwich (with focaccia bread) with the side caesar salad.  Completely and totally underwhelming.  The veal sandwich was dry with barely any sauce and nary a vegetable to be found.  The veal was this flavourless piece of meat where it seemed that the batter was thicker than the veal itself.  Think drywall as an apt comparison for the veal.      The caesar salad was the \"lesser\" of the two evils.  Completely uninspiring with a dressing that was weaker than a no name brand.  The wife's meal was just as below average.  She got the baked ziti with prosciutto and mushrooms.  The prosciutto was sparse and the mushrooms were from a can.  Again a total lack of sauce made everything just taste bland and boring.    Mom's pizza was \"blah\".  She decided to get the custom pizza with asparagus and chicken.  Where was the sauce?  It certainly wasn't on any of our food!    Don't waste your time here.  If you want a good view of the lake pack a picnic and enjoy.  You can take solace in the fact that you have the a) great view b) eating proper food and c) knowing that you saved yourself some money than eating here."}
{"text":"Eden is one of those \"hit or miss\" restaurants that I've been to half a dozen times and keep hoping that they would find some consistency. The location is perfect: right on the lake and in the summertime, their patio is superb. After a night of dinner and drinks, I opt for some takeout gelato for a nice evening stroll along the lake to the Humber Bridge. But, it takes more than location to make a restaurant great and with Eden, I feel that they use their location as a crutch to compensate for their shortcomings.  Generally speaking, their food is decent depending on what you order and the Italian driven menu at Eden is quite extensive. Pizza is a guaranteed winner but the rest of the food options are one notch above mediocrity. For the price, you'd expect some more creativity and bolder flavours. Overall, albeit overpriced, I've always had a decent meal here but I don't really come here for the food, I come here for the location. That being said, if you're not seated on the patio there is a 30% chance you will have an awful table with servers and patrons orbiting around you all night. The layout of the restaurant needs to be revamping. When it comes to the service, it's pretty terrible at times and most of the servers come equipped with an unapologetic attitude that can easily ruin an evening out.  Location and patio aside, I was going to give Eden 2 Stars, however, I was here on Mother's Day for brunch and even though it was busy, everything was great for my mother and I. I can't say the same for some of the other patrons who were visibly disgruntled. If this was my first experience at Eden, I would give it 4 Stars, unfortunately inconstancy and complacency is holding back a restaurant that has the potential to be great but they seem to be ok with just being mediocre."}
{"text":"Thanks to the Yelp community, as we came from Newmarket and them from Hamilton, this place looked to be half way. This place is on the ground floor of a new condo across the street from Humber Bay Park. We shared appetizers, 2 person antipasti and grilled calamari and shrimp, both were excellent. For my main, had the beef tenderloin (I know what's with that, at a Italian restaurant ) with a mushroom cream sauce, again very good and very rich. Asked for pasta instead of the vegs and it was so so. Shared a banana cake of some sort and it was fantastic! They do not take reservations and by 7 o'clock Sat. nite, waiting room only. Being across the street from the lake with a great view of the city, will try it in the summer, if I can find a parking spot."}
{"text":"The location of this restaurant is lovely as it overlooks the lake but after reading some very good reviews here, I was disappointed with my meal---I had a ho-hum corned beef sandwich and my side salad came with no dressing (when I asked about that, I was given oil and vinegar bottles to pour onto it). The others I dined with had breakfast items that they seemed quite happy with so my advice would be stick to those items (and perhaps Italian dishes) if you go. The prices are very reasonable and the service was friendly so I may try again."}
{"text":"My friend and i had wonderful dinner at eden restaurant last night, the grilled chicken dinner was terrific, grilled taste on the surface  juicy inside. the cesar salad is oone of my favor salad ,which i like it with more dressing, it is my perfer fusion Italian cusine."}
{"text":"Great location, patio, and food. This place is great during the summer when you can sit on the patio and have a nice breeze from the lake. The food here is great, and at very reasonable prices. As others have mentioned, the crowd can be a little different and varied... but usually makes for an eventful time."}
{"text":"Amazing location! Great views of the lake and city skyline. I have a few go-to dishes- the wild mushroom risotto with truffle oil, the Panko-crusted calamari & giant shrimp app which is grilled & drizzled with a delish balsamic glaze and last but not least their deep fried panzerotto with a side of their bolognese sauce. Their pizzas are decent also. They also serve a tasty & spicy olive oil with the fresh bread pre-meal."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to this restaurant, especially in the summer. It offers an amazing patio with beautiful views of the lake and city. The patio is always packed and lively and you really never feel rushed to leave. They offer a great variety of Italian specialties. I ordered one of their pasta dishes, Eden Pasta Al Forno and it was excellent. It's penne pasta with prosciutto and mushrooms baked in mozzarella cheese and rose sauce. So good! My friend ordered warm mushroom salad with goat cheese which also looked amazing. If you are into desserts, they have the best crape cake in a few flavours and it's an absolutely must have dessert. Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been coming here for years. Love their food and deserts! Nice waterfront location and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I am surprised this restaurant wasn't listed on Yelp. Eden Trattoria is definitely the BEST and possibly the only Italian restaurant down by lake Ontario. I go there for great Paninis, top notch thin crust pizza, delicious Italian gelato or simply a nice cappuccino ... you get it: it's an Italian restaurant and it's one of the better ones in town ... i personally prefer this location to the original Eden Trattoria at St. Clair W"}
{"text":"Sorry Eden only gets one star from me, I have been 5 times both inside and on the patio. I agree the view is fantastic but Eden only takes advantage of a view. Where they need to step up to the plate is serve. I had to wait for the staff to finish their texting before I could be seated on the patio. Another time I waited to place my order while our server  sat at a table and chatted up an off duty staff member RIGHT OPPOSITE US! The main reason for a 1 star from me is what happens after you leave Eden, FOOD POISONING! Don't take my word for it go to Google and search it. I thank god this has not has happen to me or my wife but others have. For those who had food poisoning had been met with a pious denial from Eden. For that reason alone my family will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch with the family this afternoon. Brunch was delicious. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love love love! Seems a little upscale considering its location (under fancy condos right by the lake with the most amazing view). Came here for the first time on a Thursday and they have their 6 for $12 deal on oysters for Thursdays. So freaking good, the oysters were big and fresh! Ugh, i regret not going for a second round. I also ordered the warm sea food salad. Such good quality in food, and service was great as well. The calamari was charred but in a good way, where it went well with the arugala. The octopus was deliciously chewy and the shrimp had good flavour. I'm so happy I stopped by here today. 5 stars from me, from the food, service, and view of the Toronto skyline!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Saturday night. We didn't have reservations but we were lucky and seemed to beat an influx of people. We waited about 15min for a table for 4. The restaurant was pretty busy, but considering it's one of very few restaurants in the area that's understandable. The service was good. Very friendly and attentive. The food was average. Really nothing special. Within our group we had the papparadelle, agnolotti, halibut and risotto. The halibut was very good and quite large. It was also the special for the night. The pasta dishes were ok. Nothing to rave about. They were a bit on the salty side. Will come to try the pizza, but this isn't a place I would come to for great Italian dishes."}
{"text":"Came here on Easter Sunday - have done some research on restaurants in Corso Italia (St Clare W) and wanted to visit this one.   Given that it is a public holiday, I was impressed by its hours - it still opens from 12AM to 12PM while many other restaurants in the area are closed.  Service is attentive when called upon and servers were courteous but there seemed to be a lack of staff - there were only 2 servers in the whole restaurant while I was there - from 6.30 till 9.   Ordered steamed mussels with tomato sauce, arrabiata spaghetti with shrimp and grilled veal with steamed vegetables, all for two to share.   Mussels: tomato 'sauce' is really a broth. there is a subtle taste of white wine in the meat.  Pasta: al dente. really enjoyed the arrabiata sauce but I liked it better when I added more red pepper flakes myself to spice it up more. minced garlic, olives and champignon mushrooms in the sauce.   Veal: a bit disappointing - meat was tough, a bit dry. the side vegetables were sauteed and, judging from the carrots, are the frozen kind found in the freezer section of your local supermarket. i liked how it was sauteed with garlic, butter, salt and pepper though (i am guessing from the taste, past cooking experience, smell and sight).  also my friend ordered The Godfather which supposedly has scotch but here in Eden is simply a coffee-based drink with amaretto. it has a dollop of whipped cream on top, served hot in a hurricane glass and a sugared rim. It was 'beyond satisfying' (in a good way) for his sweet tooth.  nice and comfortable environment. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a nice patio overlooking the lake.  I took my mom here for lunch, we shared fried ravioli (a family favorite), she had the burger and I had their baked pasta (ravioli al forno). The ravioli was very cheesy and well prepared. The burger was quite good as well but the pasta was just ok. I think I chose poorly more so than the food was bad, there were many other dishes on the menu that looked delicious and had high quality ingredients. I would definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"This was actually the third time I have been here and this by far was one of the more forgettable experiences.  When we went for New Years a few years ago, it was a very good experience.  Also their brunch was good.  But this time, it's gone down considerably.  Carla C was there on the same night, although we never met, and I don't know what her experience was like.    I have yet to go on the patio but being by the lake is always a good feeling.   Anyway so we ordered a mushroom bruschetta.  (Pet peeve, NEVER EVER call it broo-shetta). Instead we got a salmon one.  Don't know how mushroom and salmon sound the same, but at least she didn't charge us for the extra plate.   Anyway the main courses were veal scallopini with pasta and orecchiette con salsiccia.  What I can't stand is pasta covered in sauce.  Clearly the chef is not trained in Italian cooking.  The veal was kind of dry.  As for the orecchiette, the pasta wasn't really cooked through and was a little too al dente.  Sausage was ok.    Sometimes I believe popularity gets to people's heads and they realize and their product deteriorates.  I think they will have to step up to the plate before I cut this place off entirely."}
{"text":"I've been to Eden twice. My first time, I had a fantastic experience, we were a party of 6 (boyfriend and his family). The waitress was extremely friendly, and helped us with personalizing our pizzas as their menu had many choices. The food came out fast and at the same time, no one was waiting on their food. Our bill came up to 200$ for 5 pizzas and a salmon fettuccine (which there were lots of salmon pieces!).  I went back again yesterday, seeing that I had a pleasant experience last time. It was a farewell dinner for a friend, party of 4. Our waitress, Faith, was extremely rude, talked over us, did not make any recommendations as we were indecisive about what to order. At one point, she had put both her hands on our table and asked if there was anything else we would like. Faith was probably trying to rush us out as we were chatting until 930pm.  I ended up ordering a beef carpaccio, the plate was cold, you could tell the beef was most likely sliced in the morning and put into the fridge until it was ready to serve that day. Having been to a few authentic Italian restaurants, I am probably a bit spoiled with the quality of the beef. Eden has extremely thinly sliced beef which was not worth the 16$ you pay for. You could get better quality at a local deli. My friend ordered the grilled octopus appetizer, it was soft and grilled that the outside was just crispy enough. The ribeye we ordered also came out the way we asked, medium rare, however if you're looking for something on par with Joey's or Keg's this is not the place to go. Eden does fantastic pasta. But as most reviews say, the food and service here is mediocre, and depending on the day you go, you may or may not receive the quality you pay for. The only redeeming feature about Eden is that it has lake view, but it needs to work on everything else!"}
{"text":"This place is a little out of the way but totally worth it. You get a beautiful view of the lake and the service is fantastic. The food is reasonably priced for very good tasting menu items.  I ordered the seafood salad - uh-may-zing! Would definitely come back and order this again. Looking forward to the dessert: they have a host of gelato flavours! Can't wait to try it. The only downside is there's only street parking, but it is made up for with the view- you basically park beside the lake. All in all, I will definitely return, probably for a date night because it's kind of romantic to look right out into the lake, and maybe share a gelato."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place only has 3.5 stars??? This a 5 star place without a doubt!!! The views from inside AND the patio are simply breathtaking -- Lake Ontario and a clear view of the Toronto Skyline.  Whether it's a beautiful summers day on the patio or a cold winter day and you're sat inside.  Whether you're with a group for a bday, a glass of wine after work, or a first date, this is the perfect spot.  Best things on the menu are the warm seafood salad which is my ultimate favourite dish; the smoked salmon salad, the basa, and there's a dish that's scallops and prawns -- I can't remember the name but it's amazing.  Two thumbs up for their coffee as well.  The price is a little bit high, but I really think it's worth it considering the ambiance and quality of food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous for many reasons. The location is idyllic and you are compelled to go for a stroll along the lake before or after your meal. The restaurant, on the ground floor of a condo is exquisitely decorated and offers a very relaxing and gorgeous view of the lake. The menu is huge and has something for everyone. From hamburgers and panini to whole fish and steak, from pizza and pasta(make your own or special dishes) to veal or chicken parmigiana. The Italian food here is simple, tried and true but delicious. We were a group of 7 adults and 2 children for dinner on Saturday. The staff , including Amanda, our lovely waitress, were all kind, affable and very friendly. They immediately brought a high chair for the one-year old and were very nice to the kids.  We had pizza, short rib agnolotti, vitello al limone, Eden pasta al forno, Sausage pappardelle with extra shrimp, orechiette con pollo. All dishes were delicious, the pasta was al dente,  Desserts are few but good (blueberry cheesecake and red velvet cake are the ones we had). Coffees are expertly made, I had a great capuccino. The bartender mixes great cocktails and the wine list has a good selection and the prices are reasonable.  Overall, this restaurant is to recommend for any occasion. And since they open early in the morning, you can have any meal of the day. I have had their brunch and it is much better than a lot of places which specialize in breakfast or brunch food.  I plan to go back to Eden soon. Great food, great prices, great service in a lovely location and atmosphere. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great pizza but weak margeritas keep this place from getting four stars.   Nice view of the water from the patio was all I was asking for this night, however a margerita for $8 should taste like the start of a \"good\" night not like I'm stealing lemonade from the lemonade stand I ran when I was a kid.   Ok. Rant complete. I would definately recommend this place for something a little romantic with excellent food. Just get something to drink a little stronger."}
{"text":"It's a busy little place with great character  and you're made to feel like you're not just another drop in the bucket...  The food was fair...  not the best not the worst...  The service was efficient and repetitive     From start to finish...  from being greeted to being seated...  thru drinks, dinner and dessert very friendly very attentive. I can see why it's so busy  Everyone from hostess to management came by our table.  Made our Sunday dining experience a pleasure."}
{"text":"I am a regular patron and i love the food but the service lately feels like a fast food restaurant.  The last two times i have been to Eden  the service was so rushed i barely was given a chance to look at my menu let alone enjoy my appetizers etc.and even my wine kept being poured every 5 minutes, as if being suggested to chug.  The view is so enjoyable and it would be nice to let me savour my food and drinks and not feel like my time is up."}
{"text":"The service and the location exceed the average standard. Delightfull staff, interesting menu from breakfast/brunch, to espressos to delicious lunch and dinner, youll find something filling for your tummy. Great family spot to bring your parents visiting out of town or a for a few drinks with friends. On the $ pocket, its average fair price. 18 to 25 per head.  If I were a teacher grading this establishment, B+ !"}
{"text":"I just keep going back!  Never had a reservation, and never had to wait more than 15 minutes  The food is great, and well priced.  The parking on the street is free, and you'll be on the lake."}
{"text":"Eden is ideally located on the beautiful Lakeshore, ideal for those romantic dates. This is an ideal location if you were looking into planning a date with a nice stroll after lunch or dinner.  Now the food wasn't anything amazing, nor was it terrible. It was just \"okay.\" I would go here again just for the convenience of the location and not so much for the food. We started off with the grilled octopus. In general, I am a big fan of grilled octopus! The texture was cooked right , but the flavours were passable. Next up was our mains. One nice option that there menu offers is their customizable options for pasta. We both decided to try it out. My friend had ordered penne tossed in olive oil with shrimp, and for a myself a spaghetti carbonara with shrimp. Shrimp is an extra $5 if you wanted that add on. I had tasted the penne and it was very bland. My carbonara serving was larger than I expected. Good for those who have a big appetite. It's was decent but it I wasn't impressed.  As for dessert we ended our meal with a cappuccino and for myself, an earl grey tea. We both decided on a chocolate banana cake. It was moist but it was a little wet. If that makes sense to you readers.  Maybe it was just one of those nights and my expectations were too high. Other than our food expectations, their service could be better. I don't blame the guy. It was busy last night. Our waiter was attentive at some areas but just didn't hit the mark.  I would come here again just for the convenience of the location, but not for the food."}
{"text":"I love Eden their food is worth the money but I can't stand this sarcastic asshole Andre who works there who personally i find gives the worst customer service"}
{"text":"Recently attended a private party upstairs.  The ambience was great and I love where this restaurant is located! We had a set course meal menu to choose from.  I chose the spinach salad because of the walnuts and goat cheese- but lucky me, mine was missing walnuts and had maybe 3 sparsely placed chunks of cheese, the vinaigrette dressing was poorly mixed throughout the salad. the main course, I chose veal parm and it was ok- nothing special. But darn too salty!  My friend had the gnocchi and fish, it was ok, but way too salty as well.  I did however like my dessert, tiramisu.  And they forgot my coffee too.  Overall not the best service or meal especially since I paid $45 after gratuities and taxes.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice, both times decent food but horrible service, it gets really packed on the weekends,So showed up around 4:30 ish, they had no room at the patio, so we just sat at the bar and ordered drinks ( German beer on tap ) that I loved, eventually got a table outside, its now about 5pm, a server or hostess sat us there never came back, eventually I got up and ask another server if she could notify our server that we are ready to order, when the server arrived to our table we ordered a large pizza not knowing how big it was ( it is pretty decent size for two, I would order medium next time, the food never came to our tableand now it was  6:10 ish i was able to hail her down again, I asked how long for the food, as we were hungry, She said \" its the weekend you have to wait..I was like wow..and she was gone again ..then god knows when our food arrived, awesome pizza I have to say, but it was way to big for a party of two. no suggestion from the server, .anyway I never got a chance to get another drink or anything just hailed her down for the bill and we were out  PS. we got a parking ticket and so did 7 others cars..just make sure you are follow all parking signs and restriction"}
{"text":"Eden is a lifesaver when I want a good meal but don't feel like cooking. I live in the area and there is little else around. Even with nobody to compete with, Eden is top notch. They offer quality food at reasonable prices and have an impressive selection. Everything from pasta and pizza, sandwiches and salads, seafood and meat entrées, finger foods, and gelato. They also do brunch. Best part is: Eden delivers!   I'm a huge fan of their greek salad with chicken as well as the warm mushroom and goat cheese salad. YUM  My boyfriend is into the chicken parm, pizza and chicken fingers.   I've also had the octopus, fish of the day several times, and one time had steak.  I've been coming in/ordering in to Eden for over a year now and they are consistently good.    If you live in the area I suggest you give Eden a try!"}
{"text":"This place isn't authentic Italian. As an Italian I need to say that, because my family regularly makes a lot of the menu items at home. I had the short rib agnolotti but the pasta was only half cooked (I guess that was al dente to someone...) and the pesto sauce it came in had no kick. Add more parmesan please! The short rib filling was quite a fun twist though, very tasty.   The things I enjoyed about this place were the good wine selection, the great dessert menu and the prime location. I would come back for the raspberry yogurt cheesecake."}
{"text":"Great food Great staff Excellent view I've been there numerous times and it's always been the same quality.  Good to see."}
{"text":"Tried the grilled chicken with spinach and brie on focaccia and loved the sandwich as well as the soup it came with. They did not skimp out on either the chicken or the spinach. Nice view of the lake, a tad pricy, but worth it for the patio in a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Mutton dressed up as lamb. Mediocre food with matching service, but not shy gouging your wallet. Four 1/2 pieces of dried out French toast (may contain traces of egg) with table syrup for $10. Charges1.50/egg to substitute for \"under the heating lamp\" bacon. And tiny cup of tinned fruit is not the same as fresh fruit described on the menu. Turpentine tasting coffee. Breakfast for 3, $45. Do yourself a favour and drive to Cora's. I don't mind paying for good, hearty, fresh breakfast, but not here."}
{"text":"Location: In Etobicoke, on the waterfront.   The place: I didn't get a chance to go inside because we were lucky enough to get a table on the terrace (which is quite big).   The goods: I ordered the Pappardelle with Italian sausage and rapini. Being Italian, and having been to Italy, I feel like I know my Italian cuisine. Unfortunately, this dish did not blow me away and I'm not sure I even consider it to be Italian. First, while the pasta is said to be fresh, it was served to me in one big sticky lump that I basically had to pull apart as I ate. For my taste, it was overcooked. Additionally, the sausage was not Italian - at least not by my standards. It was practically white, for starters, and was lacking in both flavour and spice. Lastly, the rapini was very bitter. I've had rapini before and it was that bitter. I was a little disappointed with the dish. My friend had the baked Penne and enjoyed it.   Service: Our waiter, Jordan, was a rock star. He was so friendly and attentive - he didn't miss a beat.   Price point: Expensive for pasta."}
{"text":"Loved their menu, you get to choose your pasta preference on their entrees...also, try the Smoked Salmon Bruschettas, they were fab!"}
{"text":"One of the top restaurants of Etobicoke I'd say and a landmark of Humber Bay Shores. I initially wasn't a fan when I visited years ago when they first opened but I've come back a few times in the past year or so and it's definitely on my list of go-to's now. One of my favourites is their seafood risotto. Comfort food in a beautiful setting. I'll probably be visiting more often as I'm planning to move into the neighbourhood sometime this year!"}
{"text":"This is a hard review, I like this place. I usually would rate at 5, being a repeat customer and almost know most of the staff.   Since i have been to this place many times, I can't even count the number of times I visited this up place, I always liked the location. Good food, and the prices are reasonable, the place has one the the best views of Toronto lake shore.  I have recommended the place many times to friends and place.   So naturally I wanted to share this nice spot work my family one after noon I walked in with my family, we have waited for someone to seat us, after waiting for a bit we sat down, we checked the menu and decided on what to orders. Closed the menu off and put them back on the table.   20min with our menus closed on the table, we are still waiting, it was a very long wait. We can see that other parties are being seated and they their orders are taken in, and served repeatedly, but unfortunately we couldn't get any ones attention, one staff member noticed our frustrations but won't notify our waitress, other staff members would just walk by us and serve tables next door - seated later on - and fails to notice.   This could be just a simple misunderstanding, the staff is just busy serving customers \"except our table\" and not notice us. It really felt we were in a black hole and no one can see us anymore.   So finally after raising my hand and waving few times, \"hate doing that, felt like I was in kindergartens\"  Our lovely waitress approached us and said nothing. She just stood next to our table. After an awkward silent, I explained gently what happened. She kept silent. At thAt moment I thought she had a hearing problem, or maybe visually impaired or overwhelmed by the embarrassment.    The answer is none of the above. She just didn't care, I asked her to call her manager. A guy that on previous visits chatted with several times, he used to be a waiter at the place, he declined to come see us :(  I am would rate it 1 star, but I decided to give it 2 for the good old days."}
{"text":"I can't imagine why this place is busy in the evenings. Probably because people with no life seem to think it's the place to be seen. I've been to Eden twice thinking if my first experience was not a positive one, then perhaps a return visit might change my thoughts about this restaurant. Nope. Came here for the first time back in December for a work place team lunch, seven of us. We made reservations a week prior with no issues over the phone. Arrived the day of (for lunch) and the welcome committee greeted us with \"... I have no reso under that name...\". Reso? As in reservation? Act a little more professional! Again back to the beginning of my review about the type of people who come here.  Regardless, they were able to seat us so not even sure why the comment about no reservation, a.k.a reso.  The food was ok but again, I've had better. Had a Caprese Tower starter and the Seafood Risotto. The risotto at Rocco's up the street is much better.  My second visit here was for breakfast. After navigating through a mound of cigarette butts right in front of the restaurant, most probably left over from the night before, we had an ok breakfast. Nothing you can't make at home. I'd recommend that any one of the 3 wait staff who were standing around chatting and gossiping, pick up a broom a sweep up the outside walkway prior to opening in the morning. Service was ok but nothing to rave about. Will not be coming back here even though it's quite close to where I live. There are much better options!"}
{"text":"My first 5 star in Canada!   I went with two friends, one male, and the other female. To start with, we had grilled calamari and a mushroom truffle on the bread. They also served us with a house made bread which is surprisingly tasty.   For entree, I had the seafood risotto. I had to say it's the best seafood risotto I haven't had in years! The rice is very nicely cooked with fresh seafood flavour. There are scallop, mussel and shrimp in the course. One of my friends tasted mine and he decided to bring his own order back home as next day breakfast and ordered another risotto as dine in.   For dessert, we shared a banana crepe. It's actually not sweet at all! I do not like my dessert to be very sweet. I like its texture. Very soft and smooth!   I will def come back and try something else here. Maybe the mushroom truffle risotto next time!"}
{"text":"Another great italian restaurant on corso italia!   Although it is considered an italian restaurant they cook up the best homemade hamburgers ever!  Their sweet potatoe fries are to die for!  Servings are just perfect which leaves room for dessert - their awesome tiramisu!   They have another location off of Lakeshore on Marine Parade Drive that has an amazing view of downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"Located in an area which hasn't gained notoriety yet, or so I think, I find this place to be a hidden gem if you want to have drinks or dessert with a view.  This restaurant is located where all the motels used to be by Parklawn, but now, the area has developed to resemble Harbourfront or Port Credit on a smaller scale.  The place is located below a low rise condo building.  It has two levels and a patio.  Sat on the first level and had an awesome view of the lake and boardwalk.  The view is great and it makes you feel like you are on vacation with all the people walking, cycling, rollerblading etc.  This is a great place to unwind with a great view.  I ordered the the papardelle which was recommended by the server and it was average.  Not impressed.  There was no fresh grated cheese or freshly ground pepper provided.  The pasta itself was quite limp and really squishy.  Chilli flakes and parmesan cheese were on the table.  I also had the coffee which was served on a clear glass.  I found it a bit odd as it made it look as if the coffee was an iced coffee.  I asked for cream and expected it to be in its own mini container, but it was the plastic disposable kind.  Overall, the coffee was ok, not what I expected from an Italian restaurant, because I expect the Italian restaurant to have invested in an amazing espresso machine.  The coffee also turned cold quick, perhaps because of the glass it was served in.  What saves this place though is the dessert and pizza.  The pizza was great, I loved it.  Great flavour, thin crust, just the right crispness.  The dessert I ordered was the apple crepe.  Note there is no dessert menu, you just walk up to the display.   But back to the crepe, the crepe was fluffy, not too sweet and delightful.  Also had a taste of the roasted peanut chocolate caramel cake and it's definitely very rich.  If you order this, you better save room in your tummy.  They also had gelato which was in eye view facing the boardwalk, which is great as you can just walk in if you are in the area walking, cycling or rollerblading by the lake.  I also tried the bruschetta with salmon and capers.  It was average.  They provide a bread basket as well.  It was also average as it was not freshly baked or warm.  Parking is on the street and you may have to park further.  I would come back for drinks, pizza or dessert as a result of the great view."}
{"text":"Love the location of this place. An awesome spot by the lake in a quiet part of the city. Parking and highway access to boot. This trattoria menu is plentiful and affordable, offering an array of finger foods and dining options which will satisfy. Service is good, as well. Will return."}
{"text":"Good place for beer and snacks beside the lake. I have not had a meal here but the appetizer menu is decent and nothing great."}
{"text":"Good spot for some local eats. Grilled calamari and shrimp, could have done without the panko (it's an option), and the balsamic vinegar comes on a bit strong. Something about big chunks of soft, moist seafood getting hit in a sweet drizzle makes me feel weepy and sad.  Olive oil, salt, lemon drizzle... More like it. Kale salad, nice, big portion, nothing crazy. Charcuterie board for two, amazing cheese and nice big chunks. Each bite was like a babybel in my mouf. Mmm. The mushroom truffle bruschetta was awesome. Totally delicious. Probably the best thing we had. Beautiful patio and great views. Very busy even really late on a Sunday night. Great atmosphere but the food doesn't necessarily blow you away."}
{"text":"Eden is really closed to my condo so I've been there several times. Always excellent food and service. Great views of the city especially at night if you can get a table by the windows. My go to place if friends are visiting from out of town and we want something close and tasty."}
{"text":"Decided to go for pizza and ended up here as we were around he neighbhourhood.  Between 2 people we ordered a medium pizza, and beef carpaccio. The pizza was quite amazing, I would really recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I'm going to give them 5 stars. The food is absolutely delicious. We had the Marocan Octopus,  Grilled Halibut, Procciuto and Buratta  . All amazing. I love that they have Oil and Balsmic on each table. A rarity these days. The service- THE BEST! Food came out quick. We were so pleased with everything. The staff is so pleasant and even though they were extremely busy, they still manage to be kind and prompt. Our server Don was outstanding.  We're going back for sure.  5 stars for food 5 stars for outstanding service!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place quite often. Great food, unique location, amazing patio. But the last two times I've been there, the quality of service has dropped significantly. One of the owners used to be there all the time, always very courteous and looking after the details. But now that guy is no longer there, and another dude replaced him. The new guy is, how do I put this, quite douchy. And I think that his attitude transpires to the waitresses mood. Therefore the bad service. The place used to be cheery and kind, now it's douchy. May not go back. I'll miss my piece of Eden in Toronto."}
{"text":"Eden is the consistent over achiever in this area there Mussels and Calamari appetizers are probably the best in the city service is always great  this is a place were there food is always great and sometimes awesome. Try the smoked salmon pasta I like fettuccini and pesto sauce you will not regret it"}
{"text":"Lovely view of the waterfront and city but food and service are hit and miss. Last night we waited 50 minutes for our main courses (hamburger and veal panini) and when the food arrived, it was decent, not amazing, and certainly not worth the wait. In the past we've ordered their pizza, fish and chips, fish special, and pasta and all of these dishes have been ok. Not amazing, not terrible, just respectable. We've come other times when the service has been better, and the restaurant's worth going to if you want to have a drink and enjoy the beautiful scenery, but just keep in mind that the food is no better than average and service can be VERY slow."}
{"text":"Ok pizza and beer lunch yesterday. You can't argue with the view but it needs more than that to make a place a good reco. I'll be back though..."}
{"text":"My friend took me here today for brunch and I was pleasantly surprised...  Sadly the area is engulfed with condos and future condos -- there is so much construction and bland skyscrapers going on around here that it creates a rather stale environment for Eden's patio, even though it's right by the waterfront. Still, it was a beautiful day and we got a nice seat in the sun.  Our waitress was great, and even though the patio was full we managed to place our orders and have food in front of our faces in less than 20 minutes. I had the Mediterranean omelette, which was decent, but it was the home fries that I enjoyed the most. They're little thumbnail-sized nuggets with fried onions and peppers, and they were delicious! Add some fresh fruit and rye bread and I was pretty happy.  The atmosphere isn't really the greatest with glass and steel basically the only decor to look at in the area. There's no trees or anything wood in general. If Eden was located on Queen or Dundas then hipsters would be losing their minds over this spot. Still, the service and food quality will make me come back when I'm in the area again. You can even walk across the street and feed the ducks your leftover bread."}
{"text":"I love this place, they take their time to make you some great food and really do care about customer service. I ordered a meal to be delivered they made a mistake and told me the next time I called they would make it better if I just ate the meal they sent or they could send another. I didn't want to see good food go to waste so I decided to enjoy what I had.   The next time I called them up they remembered the whole thing we're glad I still came back and took care of me.   The whole team here is like a family and they are by no means the best Italian food in the city but they are by no means the worst, they are far superior then most wannabe restaurants and any of the chains, I love their steak and ravioli with a pesto is unbelievable, and their tiramisu is amazing.   And as a bonus their patio has an amazing view of the water and downtown so it's a great place to relax and enjoy good food without the traffic nightmare of downtown."}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!!! I had the Orecchiette Con Pollo as my main meal it was to die for. The flavors bursting in my mouth was like a party in my mouth with a nice glass of wine. My company had the Veal Scallopini. The Veal was cooked to perfection almost melting in our mouth. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"First time I've seen scallops as large as Eden Trattoria's. Really good food & service. I come here often enough...  Their lake front location is perfect for walks before and/or after a visit to Eden, and the view of course. Not convenient by TTC but well worth the drive or bike ride."}
{"text":"Location is incredible right on the Etobicoke Waterfront with plenty of parking (used to be free, but now the city installed pay parking). Always lively and has a great patio area. The food is decent (great coconut shrimp & sweet potato fries), but my friends weren't pleased with their dishes.  If you want a lively restaurant with great views on the Etobicoke Waterfront (which there is a dire need for more), you'll enjoy Eden!"}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza was the worst I ever tasted in my life.  It was very doughy, very dry, and completely tasteless (even though I ordered it with pepperoni peppers and extra sauce). I spoke with the Manager (Friday night) and he assured me this was the way it was supposed to taste.  Many great menu items in Eden but stay away from gluten free pizza for sure.   Update - Manager called the next week to apologize and shared new state of the art pizza oven has arrived to replace old one.  It sounds very promising and I look forward to sampling it soon.  Matter resolved and I'm pleased with the result."}
{"text":"This is another place I've been going to for years and can't believe I haven't written a review.  When we had our condo, we were pretty much there about twice a month and got take-out regularly.  We would (and still do) go more for the ambience, especially in the warmer months when you can sit outside and just look at the water.  It's a great place for groups and it gets very lively on Friday and Saturday nights.  Eden gets a lot of patrons from outside Mimico so, on some nights, it can get quite pretentious (e.g. young, three dressed up as nines with 55-year-old men).   The hostesses and servers are very accommodating though.  The food isn't really much to write home about.  Safe bets are the Fresh Battered Calamari & Shrimp (more of a meal for one than an antipasto); Fresh Steamed Mussels; Eden Pasta Al Forno (so good) and the paninis are pretty decent.  I would stay away from the pizza and burgers.  If you're having drinks, it can get very pricy.    I would rate the food/prices: 2.5/5.    The location, however, being so close to the lake and the restaurant itself is well decorated and maintained: 4.5/5 in that category."}
{"text":"We visited Eden a few times over the summer and enjoyed every visit.  The food is excellent and the atmosphere is great.  We had caesar salad, pizza, seafood pasta and mussels - all were perfect.  I must note that the wait staff could be a bit more attentive...it seemed like we had to flag them down for refills on our drinks.  We enjoyed a nice walk along the lake before and after dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last Friday for the first time. Started with the grilled calamari and shrimp which was delicious. Nicely charred with a delicious balsamic glaze. For my main I had the Salmon pasta which was also excellent. My fiancé had the seafood pasta which was delicious also. Dinner for 2 with 2 drinks each, 2 apps and 2 mains came to $120. When spending that much for a meal it would be nice to have actual linens but the food is very tasty. Service was excellent also.  Looking forward to spending some time on their patio on a nice warm summer night. Perfect spot for a first date."}
{"text":"There is something so pretentious about this place. When I first arrived it was quite busy (I was in a group of 4), and the hostess rolled her eyes and sighed with annoyance. This experience was off to a great start.   We were seated upstairs and it took ages for a server to acknowledge we existed, and again, we felt as though we were a major inconvenience in her life. Food was okay, perhaps a little bland, and prices are fairly average. I really wanted to get gelato on the way out, but that was impossible. That area was jam packed with people, and it's so close to the seating that it's ridiculous. I didn't even bother trying.  I really wanted to love this place because the view is so stunning, but I could never shake the feeling that the staff thought my friends and I weren't \"good enough\" to be eating here. The food isn't good enough to breed that kind of snobbery."}
{"text":"After a few attempts at ordering what we had hoped to be a decent Italian delivery, sadly disappointed.  Pizza was okay.  Not great.  Crust a bit thin so gets a little soggy and sauce aways gives me heartburn.  Pasta - avoid alfredo.  Just not good.  Hard to mess up alfredo but just not good. Carbonara sauce - is okay but hit and miss.  Sometimes quite runny/oily.    Chicken Parmesan - absolutely terrible.  Worst thing I've ever tried.  Over cooked on outside and bizarre rubbery meat.  Could not eat more than a bite...even then kept thinking about whether I was going to be sick later.  (I wasn't)  Having given this multiple tries (I really wanted to be wrong) I won't be ordering from there again.  Only good thing - to can order only me easily and flexible on options."}
{"text":"Hostess was great manager was great we got great bottle of wine suggested by him the waiter was great the food was delicious ... Just one thing  I have been in the food industry as a manager so when I see my waiter taking forever to respond to us or take our order I immediately look how he is sectioned off. The poor kid had tables in the whole restaurant upstairs and down . It was frustrating a bit but who knows maybe someone called in sick."}
{"text":"went here for a surprise party. The waiter was super nice and the food was great with fair portions. Loved the view & will come again"}
{"text":"This place is just around the corner from my house.  It is situated in a highrise right on the lake with an incredible view.  The food is quite good, with a wide variety to choose from.  There were three of us on this trip, so we ordered the pork schnitzel (deliciousness), the halibut (quite tasty), and the shrimp and scallops along with a couple of appetizers.  We also had their blueberry tea......it does not contain blueberry anything, but rather a cognac/ brandy glass angling on top of a hot pot of black pekoe tea....in the glass sits a shot of grand marnier and a shot of amaretto.....once the hot tea is poured in the magic happens and somehow the flavours of blueberry hit you.  The atmosphere is nice and the customer service is good.  A must try in the GTA."}
{"text":"Worst kale salad ever. For 13 bucks you would expect a substantial salad. This salad was a sad looking meal. I have had so many salads on bloor west and they are yummy but Eden sucked. When I complained, they did nothing. Waste of money"}
{"text":"Great location but not the greatest food. Very expensive for the quality. The calamari was not very tasty at all, but I must say that the pistachio gelato was very good."}
{"text":"Have visited here a few times for breakfast, lunch and dinner, location right in front of the lake cannot be beat, beautiful view of the lake and of people walking, biking, running on the lakeshore trail. Patio is great, indoors is nice as well, open till late and also busy till late, we left at 10pm on a Wednesday and there were lots of groups hanging out.   Wife had ordered Orecchiette w chicken and I had Fettuccine w Salmon, both were good without being exceptional. Apps and antipasto were reasonably ok as well. If I were just rating the food it would be 3 stars.  Clientele seem to be from around the area as there are a lot of condos nearby. This bistro definitely needs some competition as there are very few restaurants nearby, which has been the case for many years now. It is one of the reason why it's busy, especially in the summer. No reservations accepted for less than 6.  I would recommend it as a place to hang out with friends, for the view, for the people watching, great place to bring visitors after a stroll in Humber Bay park."}
{"text":"Location wise - great. Atmosphere wise - nice. Food wise - ok. It's popularity has to do with a good menu in a good area. But the reality is if you took away the location, this place would have to try just a little harder on the food.  I personally wish they did - it's such a missed opportunity."}
{"text":"location is excellent. service is decent. food is okay. place is usually packed.   if you're a foodie, you should probably avoid eden (2 stars). if you're in the area and want somewhere to pass the time, this is one of the best places in the city (4 stars)."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and definitely would have to say this is one of the places you have to eat at.  Great views of the city and the lake.  Everything I have ordered here, I LOVED!  We decided to order in last night and ordering healthy and delicious was our choice so we chose Eden.  Ordered a grilled chicken dinner with roasted potatoes and roasted vegetables and a chicken parmigiana with roasted potatoes and roasted vegetables as well as a regular size cesar salad.  Got a side of French bread with our meal (warm).  Both meals were delicious.  Cesar salad could use a bit more parmesan and dressing.  Bread was amazing.  My boyfriend doesn't eat bread and finished the entire loaf (although small loaf).    First time we went there, there was a really long wait and he wasn't interested in waiting.  After a bit of convincing, we stayed and had a great dinner.  But I think it kind of put a sour taste in his mouth having to wait so long.  After ordering in last night, he might be a fan now. Everything was cooked to perfection and now is one of his fav places to order in from. YEYYYYY FINALLY got him hooked on Eden!"}
{"text":"To me Eden is an under achiever, they do all the big things right, but if they could only focus on the little things it could be, and should be a 5 star, not 3!!  Why you ask?  Well location is great, patio is great, its clean, its convinient, good vibe, good wine and drink BUT why not have 1 or 2 cocktails you can be proud of?  And come on, you gotta work on that service, they try, but they are not polished, not overly welcoming, not the  happiest bunch and it shows!   Pizzas are better than average but again, guys you gotta move away from pick your own toppings and need a few signature pizzas that have more than your traditional toppings.  You're good, but can be great"}
{"text":"At the top of my favourite restaurants in Toronto is Eden for me. I really love the atmosphere, as well as the location. Everything i've had on their menu has been very good, i usually start off with Beef Carpaccio or Calamari, and move into something like Chicken Penne Alfredo with a nice bottle of wine.  If you haven't been, i highly recommend going whether it's for a lunch, brunch or dinner. Personally i love going mid day when it's hot and the sun's still out and enjoying the weather on the patio which overlooks the water.  The service is phenomenal, the food is amazing, and the location is fantastic. Give it a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"A co-worker had recommended this restaurant last September to take a couple of European guests there. Both our Swedish and German guests loved the food, dessert, and beer.   This week, our Swedish guest returned along with another colleague. Our team at work brought them back here. This restaurant is simply the best.   The first time I ate at Eden, I had the seafood risotto, which was fresh and fantastic. The risotto was perfect. I also had the tiramisu, which was yummy. It is my favourite dessert.   Yesterday, I went with the butternut squash ravioli with prosciutto. It was one of the dinner special and it was tasty. The pasta was al dente and the rose sauce complemented the ravioli well.   Of course, I has the tiramisu again. It was consistently delicious. Our group sampled one another's dessert. The banana cake was scrumptious. I may have to order two desserts the next time that I'm there.   The view of downtown Toronto and the lake is divine! The food and beer (I had the Radler) are two of many reasons why I'd return. I highly recommend this place, especially with large groups (7 people last night)."}
{"text":"I have had there food many times, its ok. i live a few blocks away. Service on patio is TERRIBLE. I stop by for a quick drink after a bike ride. The hostess wouldn't even look at me when he was talking to me. I figure if they don't want my money when i'm not all dress up, then they can forget it.  I'm sure if i was dress in a suit, then it would have been different."}
{"text":"As the spring weather brings warmer days, we decided to stroll the lakefront and stop into Eden for a weekday brunch with our little ones in my Mommy group.      Our group of 4 requested a quiet spot on the nearly empty patio and were denied citing that our strollers will get in the way of other patrons.    We were assigned a booth inside in the corner which made for a very awkward seating arrangement as the babies in their strollers were out of reach.  We asked for a regular table and again the answer was no because our strollers would be in the way of non-existant diners in a very empty dining room.  Since I've birthed something, I know that my days of leisure brunches at small hipster joints are over.  I now eat out on weekdays at breakneck speed, shovelling food into my mouth while rocking my baby in her stroller with my one free foot and getting the heck out of there before she makes a peep.  I don't take her out on weekends at prime brunch hours because I know I'm a nuisance to the childless and non-breeders.  I'm not an entitled stroller mom by any means.  This is why I'm a bit miffed that a restaurant would be unaccommodating when it's a Thursday morning at 11am and the place is entirely empty.  Clearly Eden is not a family friendly place.  Despite being quarantined to the corner booth, we still ordered food.  I got the breakfast - 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast and a small side of pineapple ($8.99) and coffee ($2.00).  Others ordered the BLT, shrimp/calamari salad and warm mushroom salad.  Nothing wrong with the food but based on the service, I got the message loud and clear - bring yourself, but don't bring your spawn."}
{"text":"What a great place to pop in after a long walk on Lakeshore trail be it in winter or summer. Nice selection of shared dishes cooked well enough to guarantee pleasantly tasting experience. Me and my friend were in a calorie counting day yet managed to stuff ourselves so full with delicious options prepared with every care to accommodate our picky tastes. I was definitely impressed by willingness of this place to please its customers, it is becoming such a rarity in TO these days that it makes you appreciate it even more. Will definitely return to try their pastas when I feel my thighs are back to normal again."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Went there last night with some friends and apart from a disappointing margarita, everything else was amazing.   For an appetizer we shared the grilled mushroom bruscetta. It came topped with a generous portion of freshly shaved Parmesan cheese. So good!    For a main course I had the panko-covered shrimp and scallops. They were lightly coated in panko and grilled. Spiced perfectly and not overcooked. Served on grilled veggies. The shrimp and scallops were huge and meaty. 5 pieces were the perfect portion and very filling. My friends ordered the veal Parmesan, the steak, the chicken salad and the gnocchi.  No one had any complaints.   The service was friendly and fast and the view of the City was beautiful from our table.   The lemon cake was good but the carrot cake was better. I regret not getting the gelato instead.   I have been to both locations and I prefer this one over St. Clair.  A must try!  I will definately be coming back."}
{"text":"The service is really slow and not ideal for people who get hangry. Food is good however with complimentary bread and butter! I usually order the chicken veal with spaghetti and it is the typical Italian plate price. ~ $15-$20  Do not under any circumstance order steak or lamb or any fancy/ expensive main courses at this place because the quality does not suffice for the amount you are paying   Ideally, steak should be medium rare (or at least that's what I ordered) but this place serve it as medium well done   However, that is not to diminish the quality of its other food. A smart way to spend is to get a plate of pizza with a bunch of sides and split it with a couple of friends. That way, each individual spends a little over 10 dollars for a full and satisfying meal.  Also, the blonde waitress was incredibly rude and offered the couple behind us seats before us despite not having a reservation. My S/o and I ended up waiting for 50 mins due to our youthful appearance and teenager resemblance."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in toronto. Consistency is what makes this restaurant Amazing. Service is always on point. The best dish is the jumbo shrimp and scallops. The basa is a close runner up."}
{"text":"Mehhhhh ...stopped by Saturday afternoon (Jul 16) around 4 for drinks and appetisers. Breaded shrimp and calamari was bland.   There was not enough salt and pepper on the table to make it any better.  Should have done the grilled version and then at least I would have enjoyed the leftover taste from whatever cooked on the grill just before my dish.     Our service was good but a table of 4 beside us had their entrees brought out before their long finished appy plates had been cleared. There was juggling of dishes as dirty dishes were placed on an empty table...if it had not been empty who knows what the servers would have done. That was bad form.  View is great.   Other than the agnolotti the food is so so.   There is a new Italian place just west of park Lawn road that has better pizza Oroa di Napoli @ 2312 Lake Shore...but the view is only of Lake Shore Blvd."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times. One time, the waitress totally forgot she even took our table and the one beside us and never came to give us water or bread. Eventually we all called another waitress who was surprised and took over. That time I had the prosciutto with cheese which was amazing and a Cesar salad which was ok. The next time, I got fettuccine with rose sauce and I loved it. I love the location and overall the servers are friendly"}
{"text":"For a neighborhood place this is pretty solid and accommodates a wide variety of palettes.  It doesn't get too much more convenient for those who live steps away , and Sumner patio is great.  Some menu items need to be addressed though, like the pasta fagioli , seems like its anything but house made.  Grilled octopus was good , but overall value is a bit lacking. 5.99 gelato is overpriced.  Place is buzzing almost any day of the week from the local walk-in traffic.  Overall flavors are okay, pizza dough crust us too thick  but service is good so it balances some shortfalls."}
{"text":"I've been to Eden numerous times and never disappointed with their service or food quality. I'm not sure why others are having bad experience... Tried their pasta and salads...delicious and huge portion...priced reasonably... Best part...their kitchen is open till 1am!  It's by the waterfront so its well worth the visit during summertime."}
{"text":"It was a nice day for a patio dinner. Walked to Eden to get a table with a few friends and my girl friend. While waiting for a table I went up to some customers and asked if they would be willing to accommodate a quick table switch so we could be closer to our dog. They responded with class and said we're actually leaving. Seconds later came this man with authority in a rude crude manner asked me not to speak to his customers. I was in shock. What? I'm not some hobo off the streets begging for money. I was simply trying to accommodate and trying to make sure my dog didn't feel left out. Innocent mistake. I said I'm sorry I wasn't asking for anything out of the ordinary that wasn't necessary sir. His response was even more shocking. \"I don't need people like you taking to my customers. I said I was a customer too, Waiting for a table. No not anymore, get lost or go next door.  I am in shock. I don't understand why this man had to be rude to myself my girl friend and a few other friends. Really poor manners and bad for business.  I just can't believe this man is in customer service. So upset."}
{"text":"Love coming here in the summer. The patio is beautiful, and you get a beautiful view of the skyline of Toronto.   The service is pretty quick, no complaints in regards to that. I recommend their lamb chops. Ammmmazing. Maybe grab some gelato on your way out, then take a walk by the lake :)"}
{"text":"Had a plesant evening with family last week at Eden Trattoria.  I've riden my bike in front of this restaurant many times and wanted to check it out!! Delightful =)  Menu: fair amount of options to choose from. Everything looks good (4/5) 3.5/5 - Food: from antipasto to pasta to carne to gelatos, everything was reasonably delish, except the marinated seafood (3.5/5) Ambiance - noise level was rather loud, but I'm sure it's quieter on the mezzanine (for those of you looking for a spot to take your date out) (3/5) View - splendid view of the lake and of our city, priceless (5/5) Parking - easy-to-find cheap street parking (5/5)  Highly Recommended!!"}
