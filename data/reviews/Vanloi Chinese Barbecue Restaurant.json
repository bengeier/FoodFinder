{"text":"Not for the faint of heart, but for the foodie adventurists out there, Van Loi is truly a hidden gem. Tucked away on Central, you'll find masters of asian rotisserie. When there's a party, 100% of all Vietnamese families get their roasted duck and pork from here, and this has been a tradition for decades. I remember picking up an ENTIRE ROASTED PIG with my dad for a wedding engagement dinner when I was little. 20 years later and Van Loi is still our go-to. My parents tell me the owners have changed and transitioned to other owners over the years, but luckily the recipe has stayed in tact! I come here for the roasted duck and pork of course, but also (fair warning this is going to sound weird..) Goi Lo Tai Heo (aka pig ears salad) and Pha Lau (BBQ intestines). There are different types of BBQ ducks, but the Vit Nuong Chao is my favorite! I usually just get half a duck to leave room for the other yummy dishes. Give it a try and I promise you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Four Stars for the take out duck!  Thanks Bruce, I had this place bookmarked for some time because I figured he knows his ducks  I guess this place is as authentic as could be, complete with a Chinese only menu and help that's hard to communicate with. There are 3 or 4 types of whole ducks to chose at $20 each, $10 for 1/2. These were healthy, meaty ducks, we bought a half to share.       We reheated it in the oven for a few minutes @375 degrees that evening and it was just terrific.  I mixed a little sweet chili with the dark sauce and it complimented it just right, the meat  was plump and neither dry nor greasy, a feat that only Asians seem to be able to accomplish.    I didn't see any veggies, starches  or sides to go with the duck. A bit awkward that you get take out and still have to cook when you get home but if you love duck, well worth it. Supermarkets charge around $16 for a scrawny, bony frozen bird, so $20 for a perfectly cooked, plump one is a bargain - especially since duck is so damn hard to cook right."}
{"text":"Ohhh yes. My kind of place. Raggedy, but some pretty delicious duck. I'm an avid patron of this 'restaurant' as I come here and order full ducks often. If you have never had duck, I would recommend you to try it out as its just tasty.  Anyways lets get to it. This place is located right off central in a little corner across the street from the gas station and such. It's a very small spot as its truly just a take out spot. Not quite a dine in place. They have pretty authentic Chinese dishes as when you go in you can see their menu of some bizarre things.   Also, I wanted to note their sanitary score. Even though its an A, it's not an high A. I think it's not bad considering what they prepare. Stick to the duck, and you will have no issues. The prices are very reasonable as I have been to other duck restaurants and it seemed to be really expensive.  Overall, this place is a pretty good place for some authentic duck with a reasonable price. Take out, take home, and eat it with rice or bread... Awesome."}
{"text":"I didn't read the other review so I had a hard time finding the place.  It was only when I made a u-turn did I see it and then had to make another u-turn.  When I arrived, there was only 2.5 ducks left..  I it all.  For some reason I thought this would be like the Van Loi in Greensboro but it's not.    The guys were nice.  The duck was delicious just as I expected it to be."}
{"text":"This locally owned restaurant has been here forever! I don't get out to this part of town often but my kids were craving Peking Duck so here I am.   The menu is straightforward. Just a few meat options. When you walk in, the sweet savory aroma fills your nostrils. They do Peking Duck and Roast Pork the good old fashion Asian way and it's perfect! In case the menu above your head when you walk in isn't enough, all of the food is laid out behind a glass wall for your viewing pleasure. There's even Peking duck and roast pork hanging off metal wires at the shop window, luring you in .   The meats here aren't cheap. A rotisserie chicken at food lion is $6-$7 bucks. A whole Duck here is $24. But it's worth the price tag! The whole flavor profile is 5x tastier!   I like to try a little bit of everything so I ordered duck, roast pork, tripe and the pig ear salad. This is take out only. The purpose of the meats is to take home and eat with rice and sides. They just give you meats. Everything is always fresh and delicious! The duck has a crispy skin and moist tender meat inside. The roast pork has the crackley bits of skin as the pig was roasted whole. Tender pork meat with a bit of the skin crunch - it's a perfect bite! The tripe is cold with sweet and spicy ginger  flavors- I love snacking on the tripe while I drink beer. And the pig ear salad? Amazing! Very light vinegar based dressing with carrots, daikon and celery. Think of the carrots and daikon on a banh mi - then add sliced pig ears and celery. So good! Another side that I love to snack on with beer!   The parking lot here kinda sucks and getting in and out can be a pain. But the food is so worth It!"}
