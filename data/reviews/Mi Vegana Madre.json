{"text":"' If I should die before I eat, I Pray, Mi Vegan Madre, my Soul to feed. Amen '                   --Grisamentum   Rrrrreally liked Mi Vegan Madre. Sampled their 3 Tacos and like day'm.   Makes me wish my Madre was Vegan. . . Or knew how to cook. Or even warm water. Or hugs...  In retrospect, I don't think there is any question marks left about how & or why I'm a fat kid.   Moving right along.   But Vegan Madre; They're good. Good, like great.  I stand by that statement. Or state that I meant stand. It's you're choice really.    More importantly, I stand by these Tacos. Or under them, preferably on a conveyor belt, force fed portions on portions until my skin stretches, creeks, threatens to burst at all leaky seams -- Ssttrrrreeeetch ( and hold your breath ).   And remember, when you Vegan Madre, Vegan Madre like this.   Ssttrrrreeeetch ( aaaand ) ( hold your breath ) ( aaand ) BOOM!"}
{"text":"Love the food AND the people! They offer their yummies at Treehouse Bakery on Sundays for the time being. Try the \"carne asada\" began taco! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST VEGAN TACOS EVER! I've always made it a point to go to their food truck at any vegan food festival and now I'm excited for them to have a permanent location in Glendale!"}
{"text":"First time having vegan Mexican and I'd have to say it was excellent. The flavors were spot on and very filling.   Now my reason for only three stars; to pricey and the wait was not acceptable. 4.00 for a vegan taco, I understand the work that goes  into the preparation but based on the fact your not using meat, which is a high cost factor, I don't see the reason. A burrito is 8 which I can see but 4 for a taco??  It took 20 minutes to get 3 tacos and s burrito from a food truck.... I don't think I need to elaborate on this.   Continue the great work, but based on your following and surge of vegan eating takes these factors in when analyzing how to make more net profit."}
{"text":"Like any self-respecting Arizonan, I love tacos. Especially big, messy tacos out of a vehicle that you eat with pride in front of everyone, while you walk. It just tastes better that way.  At the same time, I have an increasing respect for food that doesn't slow me down! And that's where this amazing, *vegan* Mexican food comes in. Currently, Mi Vegana is a modest, mobile operation with a limited menu, but it's still all good! Here's what I tried:   Taco al pastor: Full. Of. Spice! Not hot or anything, but so much flavor. Great, thick consistency that's hard to pull off when marinating mock meat. I am going to forgive them for thinking canned pineapple was an appropriate topping, even though that was totally whack.   Carne asada taco: Great texture, filling portion. I loved the flavor! It was almost like eating real meat--only softer.   These tacos were $4 a pop, but 2 of them was all I needed for a filling lunch. I'd try other options, like tamales or nachos in the future. I'd bring my carnivorous friends here and tell them to shut up and enjoy it because it's good. Most of all, I'd hope this operation expands into something brick & mortar, because it's really really good and I need it to be accessible.   Try it if you run into them!"}
{"text":"I attended the weekly farmers market in Downtown of Phoenix. I had their food truck, and it was amazing! The owners were super nice, and had my food ready in less than 10 minutes. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"¡¡Comida Mexicana y toda vegana también!! ¡Que raro y fantástica! Mi Vegana Madre is a vegan food truck that dishes out delicious, fresh, homemade tacos, burritos, and sometimes even tamales at events throughout the PHX area.    The best thing about their tacos, aside from them being vegan, are the exciting flavors!  Mole, Al pastor, carne asada, and more, including my favorite -the Taco Xiqueño, which is made from Hibiscus flowers.  The prices are very reasonable so we usually get one of everything.  They owners are very friendly and open to answering any questions that you may have.  Mi Vegana Madre can typically be found at varying farmers markets around the valley, like the Phoenix Public Market and the Uptown Farmer's Market. Check their website and/or follow their social media to stalk them; I do!"}
{"text":"The vegan carne asada tacos are the best tasting thing I have ever put in my face. Period. Amazing. The only thing I didn't like much about this place is the price.  I thought $4 for a street taco was a little steep. Having said that, if they offered a special, where you buy 5 and get them a little cheaper, that would be cool."}
