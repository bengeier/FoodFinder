{"text":"Love this place. Great food and fresh atmosphere. KP sandwich was yummy. Service was good."}
{"text":"We were here last night, a group of 8 who thoroughly enjoyed the food.  Decor: The interior was quite pleasing and sleek. I liked the wall decor with the Indian comic book covers.  Food: We were impressed by the variety of items on the menu. A lot of choices and all vegetarian. Quite impressed.  We ordered a couple of platters for the appetizers, 4 curries and daal. Each item was well seasoned and presented, tasted different from the common curries GTA restaurants have.  Service: 4/5  Apparently they are a newly opened place, I hope the quality stays the same. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat. We ordered simple veg fried rice, quantity was so less even 1 person could not eat. They didn't even ask the spice level when taking the order and filled the food full of chillies. Wanted to give the owner a tight slap."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Honestly the best indian food I've had in a very long time. We went, as a group of 6 of us about a week ago on a saturday night. It was crazy busy and the line up was huge, but even then, their service was very fast and the food was phenomenal!   The decor is really unique and very nice! Very well designed restaurant and really great atmosphere.  The staff were knowledgable, the owners were on hand and came by to make sure we had everything we needed and were enjoying ourselves. The made accomodations for us as we had a 4 year old child with us too.  The food was absolutely amazing! No matter what you order, you can't go wrong! The paneer starter was amazing and so was the masala khichdi, but everything we ordered was really good. Can't wait to go back! I'll be sure to make a reservation next time though because they are so busy and the wait can be really long without a reservation."}
{"text":"Went there for a big family dinner. The owner was nice and greeted us when he arrived. It's a busy restaurant and definitely recommend reservations. The food was good but there were issues.   When we ordered, we asked for mild for the kids and they brought in really spicy food. The wait staff just didn't listen to us when we were ordering. When the food came it was inconsistent.  For example, we had 3 Sev Poori on our table and they had different toppings. We ordered desserts and they got them wrong but instead of acknowledging they were wrong they wanted to charge us for changing them to what we ordered.   The wait staff were also not very friendly and didn't listen. Not sure if it was a language barrier issue or they just didn't care.   With so many great Indian restaurants to choose from in the area, this isn't one I recommend or will be returning to."}
{"text":"Best Mumbai street food in GTA Great decor & amazing service Value for money & best for vegetarians  Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"So few coworkers were talking at work and I was told about the this place. Seems like this is a famous place in India and they opened up a location here as well.   The place was busy during lunch lucky we had made reservation as we were close to 15 people. The service was good but extremely slow! not a good visit if you are rushing back to work.   I ordered the executive lunch special meal which starts of with their chaat and the meal came with dal (no tarka), chole, an entree which I went with paneer tikka lababdar, rice and naan and dessert. It was a great heavy meal, great in quantity and average in taste but nothing was wrong.  overall, good size meal but took a lot of time to come out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Garbage!! Absolutely pathetic food and even pathetic service. We ordered starters and they came before the cutlery came to our table. The server put the starters (one plate that we ordered of Kabab Platter) on the side of the table and not in the center!!  We ordered Paneer Tikka Lababdar and Paneer Laziza for the main course and Stuffed paratha and nan for the rotis. Small portions and not tasty at all. The roti seemed stale and so did the Paneer, in addition the curries were not hot at all )it seemed as if the food was heated in the microwave) The Paneer Tikka Lababdar was very salty.   I have grown up in India and have savoured many restaurants there. I can understand that you cannot replicate the exact same taste but this was nowhere close.   And besides the bill was a shocker. Honestly there are much better places that have better taste and service and don't break your wallet."}
{"text":"Great Indian vegetarian snack place when you get the snack attack. This restaurant showcases the great fast street foods but in a clean comfortable and stylish surroundings.  Service is friendly and prompt. Try out the Chole Bature (chickpeas curry and deep fried bread), and their various chats. Yum!"}
{"text":"Visited in the weekend along with a friends family. Had heard a lot about their chaat items, but did not find anything exceptional. The pani pure ordered separately was good but nothing great. The presentation is very good. Our friends daughters mango lassi was served in a very cute miniature bottle. The Chole bhatura was good with not much oil on it. My daughter had cheese pav bhaji and mentioned it had no taste at all. The overall perfect food was the roti and naan we ordered with a Bhindi Mirch Masala. The service was overall very good. I would say there are similar restaurant with less stress on your wallet."}
{"text":"It was a long due... I was planning to go there since 2016 but something happened every time. So I chose new year to have brunch at this place. We reached there at 2:30 pm and they were in a hurry and kept saying give your order as early as possible and one girl said give your order before 3:30 because we'll be close by 3:30 ... as if we would take 1 hour to decide what we want. And later we kept noticing that people were coming after 3:30 as well. I don't know what they meant 3:30 was closing when they said that to me. Anyways we ordered Tikka chaat, Paneer ke Sholay, Diwani Haandi and bitter naan...I didn't liked Tikka chaat, Paneer ke Sholay... they were the worst. The way they are creative by giving names to the dishes is fabulous ... but it would be great if they could get creative half of it by the time they cook these items!  I've had better Tikka Chaat in GTA and seriously the Paneer Tikka as they say Paneer ke Sholay was really yuck.   The place is definitely not clean. The staff doesn't care about customers. When they served Tikka Chaat we didn't got any plates... later a staff member gave us plates. The time of our main course the plates which we got was seriously dirty and was having dust... we were able to see it clearly. After finishing our meal we kept waiting for 20 minutes to get our bill.  I'm not sure that I'll go there again in future.   Thank god that I didn't chose this place for my birthday otherwise they've had definitely ruined my day!  I'm shocked how people like this place!?!"}
{"text":"KP is famous street food restaurant in Mumbai and they opened Toronto franchise about a year ago. We tried KP Platter, Chole Bature and Kulfi Falooda. The food taste is authentic and at par with original Mumbai franchise. Its probably the best Mumbai Street Food that I've had in Toronto.  I wish I could give 5 stars but service was suboptimal, they were understaffed.  Definitely a second time visit, I will avoid rush hours."}
{"text":"Awesome food ! Great service!! You do pay for the ambience and the presentation! We had dal pakwan which was tasty, the KB  chat platter was fresh and yummy, the sizzlers plater KB was good. My lil guy loved the masala coke and veg Manchurian. The flooda was nice. Will come back for sure !!"}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try new vegetarian restaurants in the GTA and this one was a delight. Although the location is in a complex nestled around an industrial area, the ambience of the restaurant is anything but that. It's light and airy and I especially love love love the quirky wall art inspired by retro Indian comic books/historical tales cover art (think Amar Chitra Katha titles).   Service was quick and I have no complaints there. Food wise, our party of four ordered chana bhatura, dahi papri and Manchurian for appetizers. Our favourite was definitely the manchurian so don't miss that!   Their menu is extensive and I'll be back to try the kulcha and stuffed parathas."}
{"text":"Came for a fundraiser with pre selected food. Started with gobi manchurian, paneer and bhel chaat platter. All were tasty but fried and heavy. I was too full when the dinner buffet came out so I only had the yellow dal and rice. The dal was excellent!!  The service was polite and courteous. We were in the left side of the restaurant which we had for our event. It was spacious enough for our 30 or so guests."}
{"text":"This veggie restaurant is more than decent in its offering. The chat (rabdi chat) and appetizer (achaar gobi) were pretty good (barring the bland veg manchurian) - the Biryani was flavorful, tandoori rotis were fresh; Pashtuni dal makhani, paneer butter masala, and veg stir fry were pretty good.  I am docking off one star for the below-par service offered. We had to do at least a couple of rounds to the front desk to get some attention and service. Not cool. For heavens sake, employ more people at least during the weekends - at the end of the day, it shouldn't be your service that drives people away from your restaurant."}
{"text":"terrible service and food is not so great either. they took an hour to bring out our food, we were at the restaraunt for 3hrs!"}
{"text":"The resuturant  has the right elements to be make a good namr in the indian food culture of GTA. It was  our first experience in this restaurant  ans we were served by a pleasant server Neelam. She gave nice advice on the house special and we tried Veg Sheesh Kabobs & one of their Paneer Sabzi.  Their menu and food has a touch of Sindhi food. We enjoyed our dinning experience. As a critic they can really do well by beining an experienced server who can introduce their menu. They can also improve their wall dicors.  we will like to visit again."}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian food they can make a lot of dishes gluten free as well. I'm not even sure what I ate as a friend ordered for the table but  everything was delicious and I would highly recommend anyone giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Good quality of food..,.,., low at service, place is spacious......,.it was busy even on weekdays, it reminds you of Indian street food....."}
{"text":"So we have a new Indian vegetarian franchise in Town. Its One of my favourite places in Mumbai to go to. The food quality is decent. I wont say that it taste the same as in my home town but its definitely a place to go for Indian chaats. I still have to try more dishes before giving it a 5 star. The only concern is to make sure it has adequate staff to take orders and manage crowd. But its new in market. So lets hope they can manage the demand better. Overall a nice experience for sure. You wont regret going here for the chaat or the dishes they have to offer. Will update the review once I visit it more then twice."}
