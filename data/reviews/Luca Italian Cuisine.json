{"text":"I was really disappointed by this place. Other than its location, Luca doesn't have much going for it. Even the bread and seasoned olive oil weren't good. The arugula salad was sour and bland, the gnocchi, bland and over-sauced, the shrimp was chewy and didn't taste fresh. It was so loud my husband and I couldn't hear each other (but we could hear the people shouting at tables nearby). The room was so steamy you couldn't even enjoy the view because the windows were opaque with steam. The service was very good, but that just isn't enough. Save your money."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Luca's we can't stop raving about the food & the service! Strongly recommend getting the Sacchetti as an appetizer. I dream about this dish at night - it's so rich and the flavors are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here last night for my MIL's birthday. Overall a wonderful meal. Huge portions!

Our server, Mary, took great care of us. She suggested the Sacchetti Con Gorgonzola and the Carpaccio Di Manzo to start off. The white sauce on the Sacchetti was to die for and the fig sauce added a nice sweetness.

I ordered the 16 oz lobster tail with risotto and my husband ordered the lobster ravioli. 

The lobster tail was cooked perfectly and so was the risotto but I was expecting a little more flavor to the risotto. I was almost a little bland by itself but okay once I paired the bite with lobster.

The lobster ravioli was delicious.

Our server brought out a tiramisu for my MIL and took a photo of the group for her birthday. To our surprise, she came back with a nice 5x7 printed photo for us to take home. It was so nice."}
{"text":"I haven't written a Yelp review in quite some time, but Luca is so deserving of a great review that I had to do it!  It's also very dangerous that this fantastic restaurant is quite literally a 1 minute walk from my doorstep.  

I had only been here once before when my husband and I stopped in for drinks a few months ago, and everything smelled and looked fantastic and I couldn't wait to try it.  I just wish I hadn't waited so long!

My mom and I went to dinner before the Cher concert and we had reservations at 5:30.  My mom's cab was running late, so I tried to call and tell them we might be 15 minutes late.  The *only* thing I didn't like was no one answered the phone - they only have voicemail.  Fortunately, it was not an issue, and we were promptly seated at a table by the window.  

My mom had the pear martini to drink and I had the passion martini.  My mom liked her drink, and my martini was excellent.  The martinis are strong, but still taste delicious (I'm the kind of person who needs my alcohol to not taste like....alcohol..) I only had one and definitely felt it.

We were quite indecisive about what we wanted as an appetizer, and our server (I wish I had remembered his name - he was fantastic!) suggested the Sacchetti Al Tartufo Bianco (it is a pasta entree that can be ordered as an appetizer) - which is white truffle and ricotta stuffed sacchetti, tartufata cream sauce, and aged fig balsamic.  If you go to Luca (and you should), YOU NEED TO ORDER THIS!!! Order it as an appetizer, order it as an entree, just get it.  It was so light and flavorful and....I don't have any other words to describe the amazingness that is this dish!  I am still daydreaming about it 24 hours later........

My mom had chicken picatta as an entree and she really enjoyed it.  I had the 
Ravioli Di Arragosto (squid ink ravioli stuffed with lobster, tomato cream sauce, lobster meat, and shrimp), which was spectacular.  My mom said it was a little \"too fishy\" for her, but I really enjoyed it.  The tomato cream sauce was not too heavy and everything tasted so fantastic. The presentation on every dish was spectacular and portions were plentiful.  My mom had leftovers (I did not...)

The dessert menu is plentiful.  I think our waiter said the tiramisu and the mousse are made in house and the rest are made by an old Italian lady.   They also had 3 different flavors of gelato (pistachio, chocolate, and I can't remember the 3rd...).  My mom had the salted caramel cheesecake.  Now, I am not a huge cheesecake lover, but it was so amazing that I might consider ordering it as my dessert in the future.  Again, so light and not overpowering.  I can't remember what my dessert was called, but it was a Nutella and peanut butter pie mixture with chocolate ganache, and it was great - dessert portions are also generous and I did manage to have quite a bit of my dessert leftover to take home (lucky me!)

Quite honestly, Luca will now be one of my top picks as a \"special occasion\" restaurant.  Everything here was top-notch.  So...go to Luca and get the Sacchetti, and thank me later!"}
{"text":"My Mother and I have been to Luca a couple of times and everything was perfect!!  However, we went yesterday after KINKY BOOTS at Playhouse Square , with my husband and uncle, wanting to share what a wonderful restaurant it is....We had reservations right at 5pm when they open so we sat at the bar while they prepared our table.  The male bartender was an arrogant jerk.  My husband asked him what bottled beer they had, and he through the menu at him...  When I ask him about the choices of 2 different red wines, he said rudely \" I don't drink it\".  That was our first slap in the face...   We were shown our table and from the get go, our waitress, Terry rushed us....She took our appetizer order, salad and entree all at once without giving us ample time to enjoy each course.  I expressed our disappointment to the Manager who said we had the table all night if we wanted and offered free dessert, however, it was past the fact, we did thank her.  Then the manager must have mentioned to the Terry, the waitress, and she had the audacity to confront us about saying she rushed us by saying \"that's how we do things here\"...   Not true I hope.....  It will take a while for us to return solely because of our poor service...."}
{"text":"So very expensive.  I ordered veal and it was so tough I had to ask for a steak knife because it was that bad.  It has lots of atmosphere and you get a lot of food.  Others at the table did not like their food either.  The waiter was great.  I should have sent the veal back but I did not want to embarrass the people I was with.  I took home leftovers and pitched it when I got home."}
{"text":"We stopped into Luca for the first time, and WOW! I cannot say enough good things about the entire experience! We started by calling them because, with some road construction, our Garmin wasn't helping find them. The staff was so helpful from the start. We didn't have reservations, but luckily we were early, so they worked us in. This is a lovely venue, with great views, nice ambiance, and wonderfully presented and delicious dishes. There are lots of choices on the menu, and the waitstaff went out of their way to answer questions and make suggestions. Every member of the staff was friendly and courteous, and treated us like royalty.

We love Italian food, and the meals we chose were really amazing! This is a top-notch restaurant. Too bad we were visiting from Chicago, or we'd frequent Luca often. We may decide to take a weekend drive just to come back from time to time for dinner!"}
{"text":"DUCK! My duck entree was perfect and moist with tangy sweet orange flavored fruit. My Mom was delighted with her Dover sole, and our server, Ruben, was terrific. The dinner, service, and ambience were 5 star; finding the restaurant was a a 4 star challenge."}
{"text":"Love love love! We've eaten here so many times and it's always delicious. Take out is surprisingly good too! Get the cavatelli!"}
{"text":"Fabulous place! The service was outstanding, the food was amazing and the atmosphere was wonderful! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Simply elegant setting with relaxed, friendly staff.  Something for everyone on the menu.  A great addition to the Cleveland scene."}
{"text":"Probably the best italian on the west side. Easy to get to and plenty of parking. The service was good. Very tasty and fresh. The sauces have a very clean taste made fresh daily. Little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"You can tell that they really care what they're doing. From the service to the food they have an extra special touch. I highly recommend it. I visited at 7 on a Saturday night and unfortunately there were only 3 tables full in the place. Hopefully word spreads and they get more business."}
{"text":"I have always been very fond of Italian food. There is just something about the way it brings a meal altogether. Every time I come here I leave satisfied and delighted. I have always recommended friends to check Lucas out because it has never been upsetting. If your looking for a good time out with friends and family, visit Lucas!!"}
{"text":"The ambience, views, food and wine were all outstanding at Luca.  All four of us said it was one of the best dinners we have had in recent years at a restaurant.  My husband had the Veal, I had the Lamb, both were off the charts!  Our guests had the Lobster, it was huge and cooked/seasoned to perfection.
Our service started out great, bout our dinner guests noticed that our server wanted to rush the dining experience.  We ordered our drinks/wine right away and pondered the menu and chatted for a few minutes.  We ordered antipasti, we chose the Calamari and the Tuna Carpaccio, both were amazing.  While ordering the antipasti our server wanted us to order dinner, we declined as we were not ready and felt rushed.  He came back a few minutes later and asked again if we were ready to order dinner, when I replied 'No' he actually snared, we all looked at each other in disbelief.  He came back a few minutes later and stood at the table glaring at us, we assumed we should order or there would be serious consequences.  Let me be clear, we were not being high maintenance nor taking an inordinate amount of time, we just didn't want to be rushed and he clearly didn't like that we were giving him pushback. The rest of the time he was very cold towards us, would not refill wine, take away dishes, etc.  As it became closer to tip time the personality changed back to the same nice guy who welcomed us at the beginning.  I have not mentioned the servers name here to save him embarrassment.
I will recommend this restaurant to colleagues, family and friends but will caution them about our service experience."}
{"text":"We ordered an arugula salad and eggplant for appetizers and both were good. My date ordered the Sacchetti which was good but she didn't care for the drizzled balsamic which added a sweet flavor. I agreed but that's just a matter of taste. I ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese. It was well prepared - came hot, sauce mixed well into the pasta, cooked al dente, but the sauce was not Bolognese. This sauce was a very very sweet tomato sauce with meat. It couldn't even be classified as a meat sauce, didn't have a meat flavor. Real Bolognese generally has a little tomato paste but is not red. It is a deep rich brownish sauce made with carrots and celery and some cream cooked for hours. Can't understand a high end Italian restaurant calling this sauce Bolognese. For that reason I won't go back since I can't trust the menu."}
{"text":"Great location, great food, great service....but what is with the loud live frank sinatra cover music? Seriously"}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant based on the great reviews it had and the supposed great views of the city. We were severely disappointed in our dinning experience. The food and views were mediocre at best. At the start of our meal, the bottom of the bread was burned- it was beyond crispy to the point of charcoal. The veal tortellini dish was inedible as the only flavor that permeated the dish was asparagus and there was no trace of veal. The gnocchi were swimming in the tomato sauce. Finally, the squid ink ravioli filled with lobster was a disappointment as the crab and lobster meat that accompanied the pasta were over cooked."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Some of the staff were not so good.  We showed up 30 minutes before our reso to have a drink at the bar before dinner.  It was the eve before Easter and at best 40-50% of the restaurant was filled...and remained so for the balance of the evening.  So it was well to overstaffed for the amount of patrons present which I would have thought meant we would be over-serviced for the evening. Boy was I wrong.  Anyway, we met friends at the bar and proceeded to wait for 10 minutes before I had to flag a bartender down to order a drink. And, many were behind the bar with one wiping glasses while talking to the couple right next to us, who had drinks, and never looked up to see my wife and I waiting patiently for our drink order to be taken.  Then, the next bartender did the same.  Finally I asked to be served and got the 'glare' from one of the bartenders who was clearly not happy I called him out.  That kind of set the tone for the evening as we were shuffled outside to the 'outdoor patio' where it was either too hot (when the heaters were turned on) or too cold as the servers recognized the heat in the room and turned them off.  Terrible system out there...and again, only 1/2 the restaurant was filled so not sure why we were sent outside when tables were available inside.  As I mentioned food was good, but my order was messed up, probably an honest mistake, but the server did not seem too concerned with the fact my order was wrong and then it took another 10 minutes to get it right.  Meanwhile the wait staff seemed very 'hard' and 'short' with us and I noticed with other patrons too. Food needs to be good, which I'll admit it was, but the other half of the equation is the staff...which was not good.  Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"I just don't take the time to review, but I am motivated by my love of the food, service and ambiance at Luca.  I have been here many times, solo and with my wife and friends.  Try it at happy hour and you will return!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week...got in a bit early for a 7pm reservation so I went to the bar for a happy hour drink or two. The bar was slammed, only one bartender who seemed completely irritated to be there. When I asked about the happy hour pricing (wine list has two prices and I was inquiring - is this for a glass and a half carafe or what because the second price was way too low for a bottle) - he brusquely stated that it wasn't happy hour anyways... well it was a Friday before 7 at the bar so it WAS but ok cool, so I paid for the $10 glass of wine and waited by the door for my friends.  The hostesses were nice enough as was the waitress, though the service was a bit slow (10 minutes for a glass of wine). The food was okay, nothing to write home about (except the bread/oil which was great but I got questioned incredulously like a cow when I asked for a second basket for a table of 3, but moving on). I got the filet which was cooked well but not particularly flavorful - I got it without the mushroom sauce, which may be why it wasn't flavorful and a touch dry, but sue me I think a medium rare filet mignon should be juicy and flavorful without gravy. Tiramisu was good and the wine was too. Overall, bad bar experience, pretty good dinner experience given it was restaurant week but I don't think I will be back to pay full price - not worth it."}
{"text":"Outstanding food try the beet salad , Sacchetti pasta and grilled pork chop. The daily specials are fresh and creative. portions are quite large. Definitely make a reservation if you plan on dining Friday Saturday or Sunday. Friendly hard working staff. If you are unsatisfied with a dish or have questions about any of the wines on the list, Lola will take care of it! 
Definitely Cleveland's hidden gem."}
{"text":"If you're looking to expedite the clogging of your arteries by eating a meal smothered in oil, with very little nutritional value and high in saturated/trans fat-- that's priced 3 times what it should be--then come here. Do not take leftovers home--the amount of oil and fat you'll realize are in each dish will make you nauseous. 

The Sacchetti Al Tartufo Bianco, Cannelloni Di Vitello, and vegetable souffle all fit this description. The following were bland: Calamari (Maxi's has better) and Filetto Di Manzo (Nighttown has better). This dish was so sour with lemon it made my lips pucker: Rucola Al Grumato (a giant pile of arugula for $12). The only dish we would recommend with accolades is the Tartar Di Filetto Manzo--this was excellent. 

Although food is very below par, service is impeccable. Staff is friendly, very attentive, accurate, and efficient. Dining atmosphere is enjoyable. View is nice but nothing extraordinary.

Overall, we feel this place is not worth the price or detriment to your health!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice view, excellent service. The ambiance is very nice as well. The only issue with this place is that it is pretty pricey. However, the portions are great so you don't need to order appetizers, salad, and an entree to get full. Actually, consider splitting a dinner at this place and save yourself $40 and then spend that money on extra appetizer and dessert. 

Overall, a very delightful experience."}
{"text":"firstly, the atmosphere is surrounded by beautiful pieces of art, you feel welcomed from the moment you enter until you leave. the food is spectacular and well portioned. You are serviced at all levels. It is a place where you are able to dine without feeling rushed. My clients have not stopped talking about the experience they had,  Thank you. I will for sure return for another great experience."}
{"text":"In a city filled with amazing restaurants Luca is at the tip of the spear. My first experience there was amazing. Beautiful decor with amazing views and a friendly staff. From the warm bread and amazing olive oil dip to the mouth watering dessert, the food was top of the line. I actually had one of the best ribeye steaks of my life followed by hands down the best tiramisu I have ever tasted. If you want a great dining experience in a beautiful space give Luca a go. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last weekend after the theater, and it was amazing! My coworkers kept talking about it and how great it was - so I knew I had to try it. It was simply amazing. Our waiter was fantastic, and he was such a big help in picking which food we wanted for our meals (because there is just such a great variety to choose from on the menu). I started with a simple field greens salad - which was super fresh and the perfect size. My mom ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was large but super fresh as well. I then got the lobster risotto - which is a whole entity on itself. It was HUGE. It was so good though. So much food, but it made for a great lunch the next few days. We finished our meal with the creme brulee, which was to die for (I am such a sucker for a good creme brulee). I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu (or try the happy hour!)"}
{"text":"This was by far my favorite meal that I have had in Cleveland in the last year.

I came here for my birthday dinner and I am beyond impressed with the food. This restaurant has been on my \"must go\" list for the last two years and I am ashamed it took me this long to go. Most people are confused when I tell them there is a swanky Italian restaurant on the west bank of the flats. But it's there and it is oh so good. 

First, let's get a few things out of the way.  There is valet parking for $5- just do it- don't try to go looking for spots yourself you won't find any. I was told the dress code is business casual, there were some people dressed in jean shorts and khaki shorts. I was dressed for a romantic date night for our 8pm reservations on a Saturday night and I was slightly appalled others did not dress appropriately (personal opinion). The drinks here are expensive; martinis are $15 and they even have a bottle of wine for $900!  They also have happy hour from open-close on Sundays as well as M-F 5-7pm. 

I was having a hard time deciding between two different pasta dishes and low and behold our server let us know that one of them was on the appetizer list. Yes please! Skip the salads we are ordering the Sacchetti Con Gorgonzola to start! Oh boy and did my life change forever after eating this dish. Hands down best pasta dish I have ever tasted (at least here in Cle). Literally each bite my boyfriend and I would make some sort of \"mmmm\" or \"oh my gosh\" or \"this is so good\" comment. We even used our bread to soak up every inch of the leftover sauce. Needless to say I will be back just for this dish alone!

For our entrees, I ordered the Ravioli Di Aragosta- oh my lobster this dish is superb! Huge pieces of lobster (I'm talking claw meat) and perfectly cooked shrimp accompanied this lobster stuffed ravioli. For $30 in Cleveland, WOW! My boyfriend ordered the Vitello Tortellini and loved it. The cream sauce was decadent and light enough that it didn't overpower anything in the dish! Oh and we did eat a lot of the fresh baked bread and our server was awesome and kept refilling the basket for us!

For dessert I was surprised with a piece of tiramisu topped with a birthday candle. I am not one to seek out and try tiramisu when it is on the menu but boy oh boy was this dessert delicious! It was light and airy and when I didn't think I could eat any more, I somehow found room for that perfect piece of dessert heaven! 

Needless to say, I am recommending this restaurant to everyone who has never been here! I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced. Food was not very flavorful. Spending $25. On a baked pasta dish not good. View was great. Forced to valet, which wasn't cool. 
Much much better places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Servers are just not trained enough to handle a busy night. Although the food is quite good the service is bad enough it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Go for the food and the service. Chuck was phenomenal. Best dish is the Sacchetti al Tartufo Bianca, an amazing pasta dish stuffed with white truffle and ricotta. Save some bread for dipping in the delicious cream sauce. Also: Saltimbocca di Vitelli, a veal medallion dish. Wonderful! Two minor downsides which resulted in four stars instead of five: Booths are really tight for four people. Plus we'd gone for the view, expecting something memorable. We didn't really know where the restaurant was located, but it's in the other side of the flats. No view of any note. Backs of buildings, etc. are not at all attractive. So...OK, but not a WOW!"}
{"text":"We went last night for Cleveland Restaurant Week and were very pleased. We were seated immediately at a nice, big table right in a window nook with a view of downtown and the river.  There was a set menu, 3 courses for $30, for restaurant week so we shared soup/salad for starters, I had the prosciutto wrapped salmon and my boyfriend had the veal tortellini for mains, and we split the tiramisu and chocolate mousse for dessert. They also bring out a good portion of bread with a mixture of olive oil + herbs for dipping. 
My salad was quite bland, but since it was a set menu I didn't expect too much (greens, tomatoes, shredded cheese), but my boyfriend really enjoyed the bean soup.  My salmon was prepared perfectly, and the prosciutto casing gave it a nice salty flavor. It was served over a bed of asparagus and potato's, with two different sauce drizzles. The desserts were presented beautifully, with chocolate shredding and fruit as garnishes and they tasted as good as they looked. 
Overall we had a great experience, great service, food, atmosphere and view. I would definitely recommend it, especially during restaurant week!"}
{"text":"I chose the lobster ravioli and it did not disappoint...absolutely delicious! The crusty bread with a chewy warm center was perfect for me.  Also the caprese salad was a perfect size and huge leaves of basil.  Lastly the service was over the top.  For a few of those reviewers who complained about price, this was a value compared to other major cities! This is what Cleveland needs to grow..."}
{"text":"Came here because of the name left here with a new favorite restaurant in Cleveland! Luca makes the gelato himself we where told."}
{"text":"Luca has great food, a fine wine list, great service and the best view in Cleveland.  A bit pricey, but worth it!  A wonderful addition to the Cleveland Cuisine scene."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently went to Luca for the first time to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary. Although the food was good, we were less than satisfied by the entire Luca experience. 

First, when my wife called to make the reservation she mentioned it was our anniversary and asked if there was any way we could be sat at a table with a nice view. The person that took the reservation told my wife they would be happy to accommodate us and that she would make a note of it on our reservation. When we arrived we were told there was absolutely no way we could be sat at a table with a view of the city because it was a busy Saturday and we had just two in our party. Instead we were given the option to sit near the entrance of the restaurant, where we had to deal with a lot of foot traffic from patrons and servers getting in and out of the bar area, or we could sit on the patio next to a parking lot. 

Secondly, once we received dessert, after taking several bites, we noticed a bug (alive and well) crawling on one of the berries. We immediately told our server, who apologized, took the plate, and promptly returned it to us...after removing the berry. We realized we did not receive a fresh piece because our fork marks were present on the piece of tiramisu he returned to us. 

Finally, we found the hostess to be rather rude and cold when greeting us and explaining that we were not going to get the table we were told to expect over the phone. I should say though that when the hostess was greeting patrons who were clearly regulars (which we could hear because we were two tables from the hostess stand), she was much warmer and more welcoming. Good for them, bad for us. 

All this being said, I will admit that our waiter was great! Very professional and knowledgeable about the menu. In addition, our entrees were very good as well. We just felt the overall experience was lacking...especially for a place that sells it's \"experience\" for a higher than average price."}
{"text":"Luca is a really great place to go for special occasions, with knowledgeable waitstaff and a great menu. 

Make reservations if you plan on going -- I saw a few couples wait quite a while for a table. This isn't somewhere you want to go last minute!

I had the cavitelli and it was a huge portion, making the more expensive prices on this menu a little bit better. It tasted amazing. I'd also highly recommend their calamari, which was done in a tomato sauce and not fried like you'd typically think of. The calamari was so tender and delicious, and that's saying a lot for someone who usually doesn't like fish unless it's fried!

I went here for my birthday and I thought they did a nice job with special occasions -- they let me pick any dessert off their menu for free, and they even took a picture of me and put it in a little cute paper frame. Nice touches! I ordered the cheesecake with fresh fruit and a fig sauce and it was absolutely delicious.

This place is pricey and probably not somewhere I'd go frequently. However, it outranks Chinato on Italian food and it's the same price level. It's perfect for celebrations and special occasions, and it's in a great location overlooking the flats."}
{"text":"I am truly impressed with this place. My friends have been raving about it for months and finally got me in here for happy hour and I'm pretty sure I'm addicted. Walking into this restaurant, I'm sure your nervous you will pay an arm and a leg to fill that tummy up but have no fear, happy hour is here! I really couldn't decide on what I wanted on the happy hour menu because everything looked so good and it didn't help that my friends said that they've had everything and there is not one thing on the menu that they didn't like. So we all decided to order something different and share. I ordered the mussels that were soaked in white wine sauce and wow was it good! The penne pasta was soft and the tomato sauce was incredible. And the calamari- please don't get me started. I've never had anything like it- its fresh, its chewy, and of course because we're talking about an Italian resultant here- the sauce again was yet amazing and tasteful. Prices are incredible for what you get. Very spacious and beautiful inside and now that its getting warm, I'm sure they'll be opening up the cute little patio that they have in the front of the restaurant. In the world of Rosa, Luca would win the \"best happy hour\" restaurant in my book."}
{"text":"Would love to give this 5 stars because our food was delicious but would have to give it a 3.5 because the service was a little stand offish and the entire meal was rushed. I celebrated my birthday there tonight and our salads arrived within 2 minutes of ordering and our entrees followed quickly. I received a birthday dessert of the house tiramisu - there was no option, it was just brought out right after they cleared our entrees - we never even saw a dessert menu or knew what else they had to offer! Kind of a bummer as we potentially would have ordered something else to try but were too frustrated to ask. The tables were pretty close together and as young adults, we felt a little out of place as the dynamic in the restaurant was a bit older. Overall, we felt extremely rushed throughout dinner - even our bill was taken as soon as we paid. We were really excited to try Luca but not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"The food here is great Loved the beef carpaccio.  Lobster ravioli is amazing.
The Patio is nice in the summer. I hear great things about the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I should give a higher rating as my boyfriend thought his food was excellent and one of the best but I didn't like the calamari and that's holding me back. The sauce is excellent. Nicer place and it was valet for 5 dollars which kind of annoying."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary dinner this week. It was AWESOME!!  Lisa was our very attentive & accomodating server.  We follow a Plant based (no oil) diet, so our restaurant options are slim.  Happy to say they had several things we could have.  What a rare treat.  We got the whole wheat pasta with tomato sauce, added mushrooms, salad & and Tuscan bean soup. Everything was cooked, prepared to perfection. We will definitely be back!  THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"Love this spot. My fiancé and I stopped in on a Tuesday night and they were busy! I'd suggest making a reservation first.

The ambiance and service are both top notch. The homemade bread is absolutely divine, so definitely give that a try! The food is wonderful too. We split the lobster pasta and beet salad -- all very tasty! Fun for a romantic night out"}
{"text":"For me Lucas was easy to find and parking wasn't an issue on Thursday night. They do have valet as an option there as well. The ambiance, city views, service and food was excellent; highly recommend. We went there  for a friend's birthday. As appetizers we had calamari, saccheti Gorgonzola, and spinaci con pancetta salad. Saccheti Gorgonzola was my favorite. As for entree I ordered ravioli di arragosta, and so did the birthday girl. The other two friends ordered the gnocchi di patate and lobster risotto. Every dish was DELICIOUSLY amazing. The portions are quite large so come hungry!  to finish off we had tiramisu, pistachio ice cream and cream brûlée - deserts are  also to die for. I highly recommend the place, you will not be disappointed! Thumbs up to the staff at Lucas for an amazing evening!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 5. For those that don't remember the old Italian restaurant that was here a few years ago, Luca has a great view of downtown in a small restaurant, intimate setting.  Definitely a one-up on most of the West 25th scene which has little to no view.  The bar portion and open-air kitchen are both well presented.

Cost: 2. Luca's cost is pricey for Cleveland- I doubt you're leaving here for less than $50 a head.  To their credit main entrée portions are large, if you're the type of group that doesn't mind taking leftovers home.  FYI, they do offer half portions on pasta if you ask.

Food Quality: 4. Ossobuco and Lobster Ravoli were both given thumbs up.  Most of the pastas looked solid, Bolognese was my choice which I would get again.  I wouldn't say they were overly memorable, but Luca's food is very well presented and certainly seemed to be fresh.  Great wine selection for a special occasion and/or wine snobs.

Service: 5. It was late on a weeknight when our group went so the restaurant was fairly quiet, but nonetheless was impressed by the attentive service.  Constant water refills (always a pet peeve of mine otherwise) and good recommendations, our waitress not just pointing to the most expensive items.

When to return: Date night.  Special occasion for both a small or large group.  Summertime to sit outside with a nice view of the city."}
{"text":"Awesome culinary experience! After not being able to get a table at another Italian restaurant  Mia Bella due to a Italian American festival I headed over to Luca. First, you must make a reservation (partly why 4 stars). I called at 6 and they said there are not tables until 9:30. When I got there over 75% of the tables were empty and when I left maybe 30% were still empty. So that was disappointing but the hosted was good and the bar tender as well. I started with the mozzarella and tomato starter, well it was average like all the other capreses you have tasted. But now comes the hero and the 4 stars... Lobster Rissoto with a 16oz lobster tail with saffron. It was one of the best entrees I've ever had! WOW! They include all the lobster not just the tail. It's rich, creamy and have a balance of flavor very hard to find. If it weren't for this dish then it would be 3 stars. Luca the chef goes around and talks to locals, the restaurant is a bit cramped with room and has valet for 5 dollars. Everyone was dress very nice, and the atmosphere was great. A blend of party and fine dinning. A definately must do if you have $$$-$$$$ to spend for a memorable meal."}
{"text":"Overlooking the flats district and the old stone bridge?Luca's ambiance and traditional menu arrangements recall authentic Italian cuisine on Italian streets, complete with Italian pop playing over the restaurant sound system. 

Our group eschewed alcohol this evening, but the wine list was filled with bottles from Italy, and had some of my favorites, as well as a fair selection of North American and smattering of French wines as well. 

The sacchete with figs was exquisite and something I would recommend anyone. Great contrast between the fig's sweetness and the sauce. Wonderful flavor and delightful to the palate. 

I had tagliatelle bolognese and my friends had the ravioli with lobster and the third pasta we ordered eludes me. 

Overall, great experience, ambiance and cuisine."}
{"text":"Maybe its the company, maybe its the food, but maybe its a combination of the 2, but had another great experience @ Luca Italian Cuisine. Went there this past Friday night celebrating my wife and our friend birthday (booked through Open Table and put that in a special request in the comments, more on that later as well). Food and service was great! We were first seated inside by the window with a good view but inside was extremely loud so we were asked to be seated outside, which was absolutely no problem. As a party of 4, we had couple appetizers and main courses. Food was  enjoyable but not as good as the last time we were there. I would definitely skip the soup, was not to crazy about that, i think for the quality of the restaurant they can do much better than that. Also, I will say that I enjoyed Kobe beef carpaccio appetizer that I have gotten last time when we were her much more than Ahi Tuna that we ordered this time. If you are ordering mussels, be aware that they are very small sizewise (but the large platter of them does make up for it little bit) . Enjoyed the fish preparation table-side, great touch. Service was very attentive but not overbearing, they did enough to take care of us and keep us happy without being overbearing (my apologies to our server and hostess, they were both great but I forgot their names, I know our server was from Albania, I just want to say to both of them to keep up great work). At the end of the meal, she brought the house 2 house-made tiramisus with birthday candles with wish my wife and her friend a happy birthday - great touch. A house made tiramisu was great!
Couple downsides to our experience is inside can get very loud, not a problem for us since we sat on the outside but can get to be a problem if you have to sit inside. Secondly, I think $5 for valet for the area is a bit much, considering you have no other choice but to park there, I think restaurant should do complimentary valet (even with minimum purchase or something). Those are minor things but still worth considering.
Great experience overall...."}
{"text":"While \"home\" in Cleveland I was told Luca was the current \"it\" spot to check out -- so that's where I chose to celebrate my BFFs Birthday.  I admit being put off by a $5 valet fee -- I live in CA & valet is nearly the norm & for a place of Luca's caliber it surprised me.  When we walked in I was really struck by the very modern, sleek venue & think it is a fabulous use of the space.  We were seated at a window table with great views.  Then we began what became a theme, we began \"waiting.\" After what really seemed a pronounced amount of time our waiter came over, took our drink orders & left without asking about appetizers.  Initially I thought it was meant to let us know we weren't being rushed but this continued all night.  Long,pronounced gaps of time between visits from our waiter.  When he did finally return (our drinks having been brought by someone else) he told us about specials & left again \"so we could think it over.\"  I flagged him down to order our appetizer (drinks half down) only to be told they currently didn't have that one -- well why didn't he say that when he told us the specials?  So again he left \"to give us time to regroup.\"  This went on all night. After the assistant cleared our dinner plates I asked for hot tea.  8-10 minutes later when our waiter returned with dessert menus I asked \"did you get a message that I requested hot tea?\" He said \"yes, I did, I just haven't gotten to it yet.\" 
As for the food -- it was excellent.  We went with the very yummy eggplant appetizer - I'd get it again in a heartbeat. I had the signature sacchetti - great flavor, especially with the fig basalmic & my friend had the fabulous fish (I think snapper) special with a light cornmeal dusting & heirloom tomato salad over top.  We both enjoyed our desserts - tiramisu (huge portion) and creme brule.  Another bonus was that it was a Thursday night & they have a wonderful live singer.  When I made the reservation I was asked if we were celebrating anything - I said yes a birthday & was told it would be noted.  One of the owners, Lola, accidentally called me instead of a different party prior to our arrival & she too asked if we were celebrating anything. But on the way home it dawned on me \"why did they ask? They didn't do anything special to acknowledge the Birthday.  Odd.   Never the less - the food is great, the venue sleek so I'd easily return ...and just hope for a different waiter."}
{"text":"Thumbs up! Always great service, great food, fantastic atmosphere. The Branzino is first rate and the tagliatelle with meat sauce is another winner. Also, best restaurant view of the city in town."}
{"text":"Wow-zers! This restaurant is everything! The establishment, the service, the quality and presentation of the food, I am blown away!! The menu is endless, the wine list is fit for a king and the views that you get of the Cleveland skyline are priceless!! Their antipasto platter came with cheeses I forgot existed until they melted in my mouth and danced with my tastebuds.

They truly have a fan this time around, the marinara sauce is to die for; the tiramisu makes you feel like you're in Italy. 

My only gripe is that it's mandatory valet parking, $5 and there's plenty of free parking nearby but you can't park at the actual establishment without the imposed fee. That's stupid to me. 

Otherwise I hope to keep this my little secret, well not so secret anymore because the word is definitely out about this place!"}
{"text":"We went here for a special occasion dinner for my husband. Excellent food and even better service. The waitress made suggestions that did not disappoint! I cannot say enough good things! Thank you Luca for helping us make such a special night even better!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for happy hour. Great deals! Ordered the calamari dish, which was delicious and fresh. Not your typical deep fried dish, but instead steamed and saucy!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to Luca for his birthday, and it was one of the best meals we've ever had. The food was excellent, but the service was what pulled the meal together. Our waiter was knowledgeable, conversational, and considerate, and struck the perfect balance of checking on us and letting us savor the meal at our own pace. We split a four-course meal paired with a white and red wine. Every course was excellent, but the real highlights were the lobster risotto and filet mignon. (I know, steak at an Italian restaurant?! Ignore the naysayers and enjoy every succulent bite.) We ended the meal with a delicious tiramisu and a Manhattan, highlighting both the restaurant and bar's diverse strengths. 

This is definitely a pricey, special-occasions-only kind of place, but it is worth every penny. It's an excellent establishment that has no need to pretend to a certain stature--the food speaks for itself. The restaurant is laid-back, relaxed, and romantic, with great views of the Cleveland skyline. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I been to Luca twice with a large group of people. The location is okay since there is a nice view of the Cleveland skyline in the background, though the restaurant itself is essentially located at the end of a parking lot behind an apartment building, which isn't very scenic in itself.

Both times I was there, I had fish dishes: trout the first time and cod the second. I really liked my meal, though considering all of the other good restaurants in Cleveland, I don't know if I would go there just for this. My friends ordered the pork chop and the Cavatelli, though they said these dishes were nothing special. 

Overall, Luca is a good restaurant, though It is not the first place that I would think to go on a night out."}
{"text":"Fantastic food with a nice touch for those celebrating a birthday! Our return proved to be as great as our first visit. The lobster risotto is incredible, pastas are fresh, and wild boar dinner is spectacular! The only suggestion I would make is that they go a little easier on the sauces. A few dishes were swimming in sauce."}
{"text":"One of the finest meals and dining experiences you can have in NE Ohio. Homemade pastas are exceptional. Service is 5 star - have been waited on by \"Guy\" two times and he made the meal and experience that much better. Side note - best Manhattan I have had - hands down - ever."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday.  I made a reservation on OpenTable in advance and I told them it was my bf's birthday and the accommodations were super easy! The location on the other hand was sooo hard to find. Google maps only helped out so much but we circled for a while before we found it. It is located past a residential parking area where you have to valet to park. $5 valet, but it makes it so much easier than trying to find parking elsewhere in the heavy rain that we had.

We were seated in the very back corner, and I didn't mind that since I thought we would have more peace and quiet, but I was wrong since it got loud in there very quick especially next to the large group table. So do take note that it is loud in there. It is not a place to have serious conversations that you need to hear every word of. It IS a place to admire the setting and be merry and happy with drink and food!! The decor and lighting was gorgeous and romantic too! So that def makes up for it.

We started off with wines - our waitress helped pick us out ones we would like from their good sized drink menu. They brought out a warm bread basket and oil and vinegar that my boyfriend loved. For appetizers, we ordered calamari. I highly recommend that! It is so flavorful, has a great kick to it, and is saucy. The sauce was perfect for dipping the bread in too. We were getting full from just the beginning of the meal. Their portions are generous. 

For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the Sachetti Al Tartufo Bianco which was a pasta dumpling filled with rich ricotta on a truffle and fig cream sauce. It was yummy! I recommend that as well if you like complex flavors. You can really appreciate all the flavors and creamy textures in your mouth...and I ordered the Ravioli Di Arigosta, a lobster filled squid ink ravioli with a tomato-based sauce with shrimp and lobster on top. I loved this dish too. Soo much rich flavor. I recommend everything!!

Our waitress brought out a candle lit tiramisu desert and my boyfriend was so surprised. Thank you so much for making the night special for us! 

Would recommend? Yes!!! This is one of the best Italian spots I have found living by Lake Erie in the past 1.5 years.It is on the pricey side, but I still recommend Luca Italian for a special night out with your SO or celebration. It is worth it! We left feeling carb overloaded but so happy!"}
{"text":"Had the fruits Del Mar app as my main meal thanks to recommendation of my server...Delicious! And Plentiful! Great staff, great ambiance, and great food! Defiantly will go back"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. Fantastic meal accompanied by fantastic service. 

First off, the bread they give you to start is just like in Europe. Perfect. I wasn't too hungry (rare for me) so I had their caprese salad, which was fresh and well-prepared. Loved it. My boyfriend had the Chilean sea bass, which came in a delicious tomato sauce and tasted so fresh and flavorful but was still light. I couldn't (wouldn't) stop stealing bites of it. The accompanying vegetables were perfectly cooked and fresh-tasting. A friend at our table had the truffle sacchetti. It is to die for. Order it. You will be in heaven. 

The menu items are carefully orchestrated with clear culinary prowess! Everything was so obviously prepared with care and attention to detail. Further, the owners were there working late on a Friday night, which to us showed real dedication.

Our server, whose name I believe was Ruben, is one of the most friendly people! He was super helpful and engaging. I was really glad to have met him; I hope we see him next time we are back! And, we will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Italian place in Cleveland! Must get the Sacchetti!!! Definitely will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"The service here was outstanding. The truffle sacchetti pasta was DELICIOUS. We had a table with a great view. Drinks were good and dessert selection was very nice. We had such a nice evening and everyone from our waitress to the managers were on top of it! They even took a photo of our table and gave it to us for my birthday. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Italian restaurants in Cleveland. Just go... You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had to update my review due to a much better experience the second time around. I just love the classiness of the interior-- cozy feel, gorgeous views and thick luxurious granite (I think?) tables. Yummy bread, broad wine selection. the arugula salad is to die for!!! I'm not that big of a salad fan but I will order this many times to come. The fresh lemon really tops it off. I ordered the veal tortellini pasta again and I know I am going to have a hard time ordering anything else in future trips to Luca. It's SOOO good!!! Better service this time around too and I am pretty sure it was the same server as last time. Normally I am a lets dine on the patio kinda gal-- but sitting inside makes it feel like a whole different restaurant than sitting outside."}
{"text":"This place gives me warm fuzzies. It's a great date night destination that feels very special between the great views of the viaduct and downtown, an impressive menu and a classy atmosphere that manages not to come across as stuffy. The cheese ravioli was scrumptious and the homemade gelato was out of this world! They also had a great happy hour with $6 martinis, $3 beers and a variety of small plates for $6 too...but only at the bar until 7pm ;)"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Luca!
Went for Mom and sister's birthday celebration and the staff made it a special night. 
 Best mussels in town, the branzino (ask for it crispy) was perfectly prepared and expertly fileted at the table.  Tuna carpacio was amazing and bone in veal chop was on point! Everyone was completely satisfied with the food, Excellent service and of course the views. This was on a packed nught during the RNC and they still knocked it out of the park. Thank you to Lola and the team! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First time here. A vendor from my job took us here for a Christmas dinner. The atmosphere of the place as well as the food was fantastic. I had the veal shank and it was delicious. The desserts were also very good. My only complaint would be the beer selection, too short of a list and the choices not so good. Other than that I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food, service, views....all great. Had a really nice time at this high end italian restaurant. Our waitress, Michele, was sweet and attentive. Everything was timed perfectly from the kitchen and came out fresh & hot. We had warm bread, calamari, spinach salads, chicken picatta, and the sachetti...it was all delicious. The calamari is sautéed and comes in a dry white wine cherry tomato sauce...so good. Someone on google reviews was bent out of shape over the mandatory $5 valet. Not a big deal. If I didn't have $5 to spend, I wouldn't be eating at a high end restaurant with Michelangelo & Picasso artwork on the walls. The valets were great and quickly maneuvered parking on the viaduct. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"5 stars if you order the Kobe beef carpaccio, sacchetti, and branzino, and also get one of their good waiters. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how amazing this restaurant is. I live in Texas and wanted a nice restaurant to celebrate my son's white coat ceremony and wedding proposal. We chose Luca. I emailed them and received a response within 24 hours. They wanted all the details and sent me the menu and wine/champagne list. We emailed back and forth and locked in the details. The day before they contacted me to check in and firm up the plan . When our party of 14 arrived, they were so polite and kind and escorted us to our beautiful table with an awesome view. They were so attentive during our course and the manager and wait staff came so often to check on us. After my son proposed to his girlfriend, the brought a little cake with a candle and took a picture.  A short time later they brought that picture in a cute frame with a nice congratulations note. The food and people are amazing! We will be back next time we are in town!!!"}
{"text":"Being Italian I am a big fan of Italian food, but also a little more picky.  The menu looks great, but actual food did not measure up to expectations.  

Completely bread and oil had a great oil mix, but burnt and dry bread.

Serving house-made fresh pasta at an expensive Italian restaurant means it has to be great.  My pappardelle stuck together, and was too soft.  Not horrible, but not great.  The ragu was overly salty, somewhat bland, and certainly not exceptional in any way. The meat was either too fine ground or simmered too long.  I could not pick out anything special from the veal or wild boar written on the menu - it could have been ground chuck for all I could tell.

Almost everything was doused in truffle oil with a very heavy hand - something my wife appreciated, I was okay with, but others dinners might be offended by.

The fish sea-bass special was by far the best entree of the group, and appetizers generally seemed better than entrees.

A variety of salads were available, but this was not printed on the menu, nor explained to us before our order was taken.  I am still not sure if they were complimentary or extra, and my wife only ordered a beet salad on special because she thought the restaurant didn't offer any others.  Very confusing.

For service, the staff was generally helpful, but seemed a little confused.  Possibly they are still new.

Overall good food, but Cleveland has better at this price."}
{"text":"Been to Luca twice over the last few months, both to celebrate birthdays. It's a perfect place to do so. Jackie, our waitress, was awesome and she went out of her way to make the entire experience great. Thanks to her for making my sister's birthday truly memorable.  The food is great too and the view of the city will have you snapping pictures. Definitely will be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Luca is the fanciest restaurant I've ever been in that actually delivered on feeling fancy. You have to park by valet, the lighting is dim, they know all the details of all their wines, and it's expensive.

Don't let that take away from the experience though, the food is delicious. I had peeked at the menu beforehand, not sure what I should expect from such a place. I panicked at the thought that it would be real Italian food, as in, no marinara sauce Italian food.

But, a picky eater like me did not need to fret. Their pre-dinner bread was amazing, and their gnocchi comes with a marinara sauce, with pepper flakes over it. The spice was a welcome flavor. 

No question, Luca is a place you take to impress people, or better yet, have someone take you there to be impressed."}
{"text":"rude, inattentive and unaccomodating.  i felt as if myself and my party were not welcomed at all.  even the hostess did not greet us.  never again."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Sunday, Lola Sema seated us at once. We had a great view of Cleveland Flats area. Our waiter was very cordial and explained each course in detail. My wife had Steak Tartar as a starter I had the shaved Beef Carpaccio both were excellant.
The arugala salad was great.  The main course was a pasta dish with a meat sauce that included, duck, wild boar, and veal. 
I realize that all this sounds like normal Italian food. But is was prepared very well. The service was a 10.  The ambiance is great. I would highly recommend it. We topped off the meal with 2 very good bottles of wine.  The wine list is fashionable with a price range for any budget..
Returned several times since my first review, this is no mistake. Very Good.
Luca will do well at this location.."}
{"text":"Kudos to Luca for taking a step in the right direction as far as breathing new life in the left-for-dead flats district. The restaurant has great views of the city, especially at night. The parking lot and the road up to it is the repurposed viaduct -- an old bridge made of stone arches. Gorgeous. I'm pulling for this district, it always had potential.

The only letdown was the bathroom."}
{"text":"Food overall was good but definitely not worth the cost. The service was incredibly slow, even though we went on a week day at 6pm. Furthermore, on my reservation that I booked, I notified them that it was our anniversary. I didn't expect a \"red carpet\", but would have been nice for someone there to have either remembered to mention that or do anything to acknowledge that. With a dinner for 2 costing over $160 it would have been nice to have been treated in a way that was aligned with the cache that the restaurant carries itself to be."}
{"text":"My birthday was on December 28 and my family surprised me by hosting my birthday dinner at Luca. I really really love that valet is $5. In the winter months, that was music to my ears. We were seated in the heated patio area which is so nice and romantic. I ordered a couple of glasses of sauvignon blanc wine and had a few appetizers on the table including an appetizer special of shrimp cocktail mussels and calamari. Calamari is the best here. Cooked perfectly. For an entree i order the lobster ravioli. I really liked it. Huge chunks of lobster and shrimp. I liked it even better when i took some to go. Thank you Luca for the amazing birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Went for our Anniversary yesterday and the service and food was amazing. Beautiful and elegant place and large food portions h wasn't expecting. The food is done with great Italian inspired flare. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Luca went above and beyond our expectations! I took my fiance there to celebrate his birthday and they accommodated every request I had while making the reservation. The food was AMAZING, the view was unbeatable and our server was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable! I highly recommend Luca to anyone looking for some of the best Italian food I've ever had! The sacchetti is to die for!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Extensive wine list with many Italian wines   We tried the fresh caprese salad. The bread was freshly baked, warm and served with olive oil and balsamic. My friend and I shared the lobster risotto special. It was probably the most amazing lobster dish I have ever eaten. Sooo much lobster, creamy risotto, just phenomenal. Enough for our meal that night and left overs for later. Can't wait to go back to Luca and try some of their other options!"}
{"text":"Very Very good. I chose the Lamb chops well done. I had the  best server you could ever ask for\"Michelle\", She knew all specials very well,A+. I will definitely be returning. Cocktails and everything was awesome. Great atmosphere, little band,great experience"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about our experience at Luca this past Saturday night.  We were a rowdy crew of 10 celebrating my friends 30th birthday.  We had a wide array of offerings from the menu, and nothing disappointed! My main dish was the Sacchetti al Tartufo Bianco and it was unbelievable! And the owners, Luca and Lola were the sweetest. Everyone needs to check this place out.  From the view, to the wine, to the service- you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This has to be my new favorite restaurant in Cleveland. My friend and I went for dinner for restaurant week and the lobster squid ink ravioli was one of the best dishes I've ever tasted. Definitely recommending this place to all my friends. For dessert I got the tiramisu and that was amazing as well. Service was great and we got a table with a great view of the skyline. I can't wait to come back here again."}
{"text":"This is a good place. Started with yummy clams and gnocchi with arrabbiata sauce. That was a special request. The piccata was good, not great. I have had better. Service was fantastic and we would go back."}
{"text":"Luca is by far one of my favorite high end Italian restaurants! I have yet to be disappointed by service nor the food. I was just there Thursday for Restaurant Week. Once we were seated and drinks were ordered, the waitress brought out the bread and dip. The breads' crust was crispy and the dip was a nice blend of EVOO, balsamic, parmesan cheese and another seasoning I just couldn't put my finger on. 

The dinner itself was out of this world! I started out with the mixed salad, a nice and light way to start the meal. For my main course I got the Veal Tortellini which had the perfect amount of sauce. Finally for dessert I got the chocolate mousse, there were 3 chocolate cups with the mousse topping them. Served with raspberries and blueberries. 

My favorite thing about Luca is eating there on Thursdays! Rick and his singing partner Sharona are there performing at 7:30- 8 ish until 10. I just love this singing duet! It makes for a great date night!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best Italian in Cleveland, and one of the best I have had in the country. Everything from the bread to the pasta is first class."}
{"text":"We went there for an anniversary dinner. I called and told the hostess on the day of that we are celebrating an anniversary. She stated that Luca provides a free dessert on the house and take a picture of you, which they print. Our server had no idea it was our anniversary and we received neither of these. I didn't want to create a scene and be rude, so I did not say anything to the server. I was extremely upset and embarrassed about this as I had told my significant other that they did this. We were excited that Luca would take the time to acknowledge and make us feel special on our day. I was upset that this did not happen. 

The food was great though. We got the ravioli and gnocchi, which were huge portions and very delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian restaurant. Amazing wine list, great food and pretty views. Gets very crowded, make a reservation. Valet parking."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night playing the 5th wheel with 2 married couples.   We had 7:30 reservations, so we showed up early an enjoyed a few cocktails at the bar.   The restaurant was busy and the atmosphere was energetic and lively.  As soon as our table opened up we were sat promptly.
Everything from the service and and the food were top notch.  Our server was extremely attentive and very friendly.  The owner, Lola came over and helped with the wine selections as well.  The dinner lasted almost 3hrs from drinks to dessert, we never felt rushed and our courses were spread perfectly apart. 
We all decided that we will come back here for another amazing dinner.  Come here with a loved one or just with a group of friends.  Expect to leave happy and satisfied.  Luca met all expectations."}
{"text":"Great italian food in a very interesting location.  There is valet parking once you find the place, and there are signs guiding you once you find the Superior viaduct.  Items are well prepared and plates are extremely generous in size.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great place w tremendous food! And great happy hour!! I've recommended many friends here & have never heard anything other than big Thanks back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I chose Luca to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary. I cannot say enough about this place. From the service to the food to ambiance...just perfect! This is def a place we will br returning too. My husband had a the pork chop and i had their signature dish Sacchetti and the beet salad. Now I find myself CRAVING both dishes. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Very good food at very high prices.  While some of the prices are fair for the item served, some (like pasta) are very overpriced. Pasta containing no meat or fish at prices in excess of $25 is unreasonable.  Service was inconsistent and no one from management stopped by the table to see if all was well.  Previous visits were more satisfying.  We will return again someday, but not in the near future."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Luca last week, since the menu sounded delicious and the other Yelp reviews were great. When I walked in, I was impressed by the stunning view of the flats and the downtown Cleveland high-rises, as well as with the modern decor. The servers were very friendly, and willing to answer questions. However, when it comes to the food, I was very underwhelmed. As an appetizer, I got a white bean soup, which was laking in white beans, and drenched in what tasted like supermarket-bought parmesan cheese. What bothered me the most about the soup was that it did not list cheese as an ingredient on the menu, but it certainly the main ingredient in there, whether intentionally or unintentionally! I wasn't very hungry, so I ordered an appetizer salad as my main course. I was beyond disappointed. I was given, an uncut, undressed head of lettuce, which is absolutely unacceptable given the price they are charging for it! On the menu, they listed raspberries, cheese, endives, and dressing, which were all absolutely minimal. And when I say minimal, I mean, four endive leaves, three to four small pieces of gorgonzola, and three or four raspberries, and a very light drizzle of dressing! The people I was with ordered two different kids of  ossobuco, one veal and one wild boar. The portions were huge, and they tasted fine on there own, but tasting them one after the other, it was clear that they were using the same or extremely similar sauces on each, which in my opinion doesn't highlight the different flavors of the two kinds of meat, unfortunately. The wild boar ossobuco came with a side of pasta, which was overcooked and bland, which is unacceptable at an Italian restaurant and given its price range!

Overall, I feel that Luca had the potential to be a fantastic restaurant given its great location, view, and service, but its disappointing, lackluster food overrides the positives!"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since we ate there .  But the whole experience was spot on (except the finding it and parking thing). 

The only complaint is finding the place.  Gps was somewhat helpful,  it led us to a gate that said residential parking only!  Not one sign for Luca patron parking or for Luca!  After driving in circles for a bit, we called and they said all we have to do is go through the gate and valet will park it.  Well now.   They also said they are trying to get a sign put up, so hopefully they did by now.   

Staff was nice and helpful with the menu.  Good recommendations for food & wine.   

views out of the Windows are quite nice of the flats.

Food is... How can I put this...DIVINE!  Just amazing.  We had calamari and the muscles for apps. Amazing! 
I can't remember the entrees, except I had some sort of tortellini looking pasta, and that was amazing as well!  My hubby liked his meal too.  

We will be back for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Went to Luca for restaurant week. 3 course meal + glass of wine for $40. 

While driving through back alleys and winding roads, seemingly in the middle of nowhere, I questioned the decision to choose Luca over other restaurant week participants in downtown cleveland. Could good authentic italian really be served in this area? Walking into the restaurant, my concerns were quickly laid to rest driven by the warm, intimate interior. The restaurant is a beacon of light in an otherwise shady neighborhood. 

I ordered the salad, lobster ravioli and the tiramasu. The lobster ravioli was bomb. Big portions and generous amounts of lobster made this a terrific deal at restaurant week pricing. I am a pasta fiend and this dish had all the right components from the firm but melt in your mouth consistency of the ravioli to the rich, creamy tomato sauce. 

This is a hidden gem, which I am glad to have tried during restaurant week. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"HL called before driving from our hotel to Luca and lucky for us they said they had a table for two available.

The restaurant attracts a trendy crowd and is upscale and lovely inside.

The warm bread and olive oil balsamic dipping sauce brought to our table was nice.

Both HL and I had a hard time finding pasta dishes we liked! I started with the arugula salad and it was okay. The grape tomatoes were very over ripe (ate one) and I did not enjoy the taste at all.

I told our server I wanted a simple pasta dish with olive oil and vegetables. She suggested risotto which is not pasta.
I settled on the tagliatelle with olive oil and added mushrooms. It came topped with tons of wild mushrooms and micro greens. I was not offered a spoon to eat my pasta. I had to ask for Parmesan cheese too, plus I also asked for a refill on water.

HL originally ordered the veal stuffed cannelloni but about 10 minutes later our server came over and said she was sorry but it was no longer available. After perusing the menu again he settled on the orecchiette pasta with fennel sausage and rapini. 
Imagine both of us being terribly disappointed after tasting our pasta dishes. I did not care for the taste of the olive oil as it was too plentiful and the mushrooms were just too much and I found the addition of so much micro greens definitely not needed at all.
HL complained the fennel sausage was greasy and made the sauce not enjoyable too.
He picked at the rapini and then we both decided we simply did not care for the taste of our pastas.

To be fair the manager did come by and ask HL if everything was okay, but by that time HL decided there was no reason to complain as all we wanted to do was leave. Our server asked if she could box up our meals, but we both said NO!

We are definitely foodies and the food we were served tonight just wasn't great! We've eaten pasta all over the US and in Europe and Luca just doesn't measure up to great Italian restaurants!

I still have an awful taste in my mouth from the few bites I ate of my pasta!

I don't know what else to say other than we would never come back or recommend this restaurant to anyone else."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful, offering great views of the city. The service was very good. Our server was attentive and helpful. We got the artichoke appetizer which was excellent. The mains were average. I was disappointed in the wild boar and pasta. The meat was tender but lacked flavor.  For the price I'd say I was a little disappointed overall."}
{"text":"I was at the new Luca in Cleveland Ohio I waited an hour and a half for my food I was very disappointed with the service. Don't go if you do not have patience"}
{"text":"The food was not that good even though I heard good reviews about this restaurant. Our server was rude, had no manners. He threw utensils on the table, kept reaching over us, and was legitimately rude. For the amount of money we paid, horrible service. I'll never come back"}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time last night--friends who eat there frequently took us. Outstanding!!  Menu was excellent--had s difficult time deciding what I wanted because there were several items that were very tempting. Service and atmosphere were outstanding. Had a little snafu with the reservation but management accommodated it very quickly and cheerfully even on a very busy night. It's on the pricey side but I don't mind paying more for a memorable dining experience. Will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, selection and service.  I will definitely return and recommend this venue."}
{"text":"This place is sooo Italian! I don't come often here but every time I am satisfied with quality of food, service and atmosphere of the restaurant. 
Last time, I came with my girlfriends to celebrate something lol. My girlfriend and I were hungry for the special dish of the place- sacchetti al tartufo bianco. Oh my, this dish is die for- ravioli with truffles and fig sauce! 
Also, we had stuffed eggplants, soup and salad- everything was prepared well and tasted delicious. 
Besides, you can ask to be seated by the windows where is the view. 
Enjoy this place and notice the art on the walls. 
Highly recommending to visit!"}
{"text":"While Luca may be a bit off the beaten path and not the easiest to find... this restaurant more than makes up for in quality of service, great views of the city, and absolutely stunning food. 

I came here on a Sunday night and the place was still quite brimming with activity. The place has great ambiance with great skyline views of Cleveland being on the west side of the flats. Parking options are a little tricky requiring you to either park outside of the gates before the restaurant (you'll understand if you drive there) and walking a short distance to the entrance OR using their valet service. The other parking is reserved for the nearby residents. 

Our service was excellent throughout the meal with multiple individuals coming by to refill waters, ensure we had what we needed, and even making recommendations for dessert and other parts of the meal. 

The food... oh man, quite a delight. We split the Sacchetti Al Tartufo Bianco which is an absolute MUST. The white truffle ricotta was the best item we got that night. The cream sauce does make it a bit heavy, so while I may not have ordered it for my main course, it makes a fantastic starter. 

I also got the lobster ravioli that was quite good. Some of my lobster was a bit overcooked, but the dish still featured far more lobster meat than I was expecting. 

While I didn't get any dessert this time around, I think I will when I come back as all of the desserts coming out of the kitchen looked incredible. 

Bottom line, Luca is a fantastic place for a good meal. While difficult to find and parking may be a bit strange, the food, service, and ambiance will definitely make it worth your while."}
{"text":"Wow! I was blown away with the food from here. The bread (cheat day) was so soft and fresh! I had the beat salad which was phenomenal! The pistachios were a joyful addition. The main course was the lobster ravioli and they were extremely generous with the portions and lobster. Great views and good service!"}
{"text":"I can't believe i've never written a review for Luca. Gosh, I love this place. Like, just leave me here.

When it comes to Italian in Cleveland, this is as good as it gets. The vitello tortellini is to-die for. Its honestly my favorite Italian dish in Cleveland. The sauce is so creamy, the veal stuffed tortellini is cooked perfectly, and the prosciutto is mouth watering. Just a few bites, and you're in heaven. The flavors are so rich that you're satisfied at first bite. Its also served with asparagus, but is definitely a very heavy dish (consider skipping lunch!). For dessert, you have to try the cannoli. Its served in the form of 4 mini cannoli with fresh blackberries and strawberries, and it will melt in your mouth. The presentation is lovely.

The restaurant itself is romantic, lovely, and full of character. They have a beautiful wine list, sometimes have live music, and often participate in Restaurant Week. They also have an indoor-outdoor screened patio that is gorgeous for private parties or if you'd like to sit outside. Luca would be a beautiful choice for a special event, rehearsal dinner, etc. Also, while the Superior Viaduct itself also gets a bad reputation for parking, Luca itself offers dedicated valet parking. I can't recommend Luca enough."}
{"text":"This restaurant was superb!  Last night was our first time here (we were here when it was Ponte Vecchio and this is way better).  The views of downtown and the flats are stellar and the atmosphere is upscale, sophisticated yet comfortable.  They were busy, but the service was impeccable.  We started out with the mussels appetizer which was excellent. Our friends ordered a calamari which was also very good.  They also serve a delicious bread shortly after sitting down.  On the cocktail front, I had a cucumber gimlet which was delicious.  For my meal I asked the server for a recommendation and she recommended the sacchetti.  It was in a white truffle sauce and stuffed with ricotta.  It was divine.  Everyone thought it was the best thing on the table.  Others ordered a pasta with clams and shrimp, a bolognese, the branzino, and I can't remember the rest.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food.  We shared the creme brulee and tiramisu for dessert and both were delicious.  I had a lucca coffe for an after dinner drink which was also excellent.  The food is quite pricey, so this is definitely a special occasion restaurant, but it is so worth it."}
{"text":"We went to Luca for my 27th birthday back in November. Everything was lovely! A trip to Luca could make any evening special! I cannot wait to come back. 

The appetizer I had was a cheese, olive, and charcuterie plate. The portion served of each item was gigantic and it was so fun to try all of the different types. They also brought us wonderful fresh bread and dip which was delicious. The entrees (Bolognaise, veal medallions, salads were among the choices ordered by our table) were served piping hot, very clearly made from the highest quality and freshest ingredients. The portion was very generous and I ended up taking some home. Finally, we had creme brulee and coffee for dessert. The creme brulee was covered with a ton of fresh fruit and flower petals which was visually beautiful and the taste was delicious. They have a great wine selection and the wine our waiter recommended was perfect with the food everyone ordered! Luca's bar also makes a mean French 75. 

As far as service goes, our waiter was wonderful and came back often without rushing us. He refilled our wine from the bottle we ordered and was generally just great at his job."}
{"text":"amazing first experience! the waiters were extremely friendly and the food was delicious. loved the view of the flats and the atmosphere of the restaurant! definitely recommend the beef carpaccio"}
{"text":"Not the level of service or taste I would have expected for the price. Notably, the manager did come by and ask how our food was, and very willingly had another dished prepared for us. For that, I've added a +1; without, it would've been a 1/5 experience.

Service: Extremely slow; reasonable for a group wanting to take time eating and talk for hours. Not ideal for folks seeking a good meal at decently timed intervals (entrees were placed on our table 1 hour after we sat down and our visit was 2.5 hours)
-- It took our waitress 20 minutes to come over after we were seated on a Tuesday evening with many other seats available. We ordered our appetizer first, and this came out quickly from the kitchen. It wasn't until we were completely done with our appetizer that she returned to our table to put in our entrees (40 minutes from start time). Our entrees finally came out an hour after we were first seated
-- Since it took our waitress 20 minutes to come over to speak to us about the menu, while we already had decided our entrees, the specials were not communicated. The mention of the specials made us want some additional time to decide whether or not to switch our initial choices, which we ended up doing, but wish we could have gotten either a \"Specials\" list up front, or that the waitress came up to us immediately after being seated so that we knew all of our options up front.

Food: Decent to extremely poor; considering the price, many other Cleveland options exist
---- Cozze Azzurro (fresh blue mussels)
A good start to our experience; they were fresh and seasoned well
---- Risotto del Giorno (risotto of the day): Lobster
Extremely bland. There is saffron in this dish, but I was very surprised at how little flavor this risotto had. The lobster did not add much. I tried to mix bites of the risotto with the lobster meat, which helped, but needed to eventually give in and add salt and pepper to give the risotto some more flavor. Something felt missing to put the tastes of the dish together.
---- Grouper (special): The grouper was prepared with a red sauce; the fish itself was overcooked and the sauce was salty and overwhelmed the finished flavor of the fish. We may have ordered wrong, but it would have been nice to have a finished dish with the correct balance of flavors to enhance the fish itself, rather than drown it out. The grouper was redone and prepared with caper sauce on the side; the fish was not overcooked on the second go around, but the caper sauce was not particularly memorable.

Happy hour prices may make this restaurant more worthwhile, but the full-priced experience was not ideal, given the slow service and quality of the food. For first timers, and if I were to visit again, I would consider the pasta instead."}
{"text":"Was my first Yelp Supper Club location! My wife and I enjoyed the food and the company. As you walk in, the place gives off a very classy vibe. Was impressed!

THE FOOD 
We really enjoyed our meals. The wife and I shared the calamari appetizer which was sauteed in a spicy wine-tomato sauce. It was a nice change of pace from the fried version typically served in restaurants. For my main entree I chose the Vitello Tortellini (veal tortellini) in a white cream sauce with prosciutto and asparagus.  My wife had the Filetto Di Manzo (filet mignon) with porcini mushrooms and demi glaze. 

THE STAFF
Hostess- very friendly, professional and well dressed just like you'd expect in a place like this.

Servers- they were great. Very friendly, helpful and handled a party of 16 with relative ease.

Bartender-  impatient jerk!  He almost cost them a star in my rating."}
{"text":"Food was perfectly prepared, delicious and served piping hot.  Our server, Mattie, was terrific.  Prices are high, but reasonable and the place is noisy, but not overly so.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I left this place feeling like a fat lard, BUT at least I'm a happy & full lard.
Luca's did not disappoint. It is a bit on the pricey side, but the quality is definitely there.
I started off my meal with a cocktail - Maple Tart. I'm not sure where the \"tart\" comes into play, but the drink was still good. A perfect night cap for me. Maple whiskey + black walnut bitters. Yum. 
I ordered the Calamari to start. I LOVE that I've never had calamari like the way Luca serves up their dish. Sautéed squid instead of breaded and fried? Yum. The white wine cherry tomato sauce was also delicious.
For my entree, I had such difficulty choosing between the pasta dishes, but with the help of my server, I went with the Sacchetti al Tartufo Bianco. It's one of Luca's more raved about dishes. I love anything with truffle, so count me in. The fig balsamic was the perfect touch! No wonder people love this dish. 
If I ever find myself in Cleveland again, I'll be coming back to try the Ravioli di Aragosta."}
{"text":"4/21/18 Sacchetti al tartufo bianco appetizer had a unique creamy and tasty flavor. The lattuga di bib tritare salad was disappointing as were the drinks (Paris mule, long Island iced and limoncello). The service was incredibly slow. However, the entrees (orrechiette con rapini and ravioli di aragosta) were outstanding! Menu is pricy. Great views of downtown. Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was horrible. We waited an hour at the bar for our reservation which was for a table of eight. Very crowded and loud. When we were finally seated. We had to wait for menus, ask for drink menus, and then our drinks were never refilled throughout the evening. 
Our server seemed rushed and flustered and did not give our table more than 2 seconds worth of his attention.  I ordered the Branzino which was poorly deboned and hardly had any taste. The sacchietti was delicious as well as the lamb dish our friends ordered. I'm not sure we will try this place again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. I expected a salad with the price of my entree, but I was elated the chef was able to accommodate my gluten free diet.  I had the roasted half chicken and it was phenomenal. The pistachio gelato was to die for."}
{"text":"For starters GPS will get you lost. If this is your first time here, you will drive around for a few minutes looking for the actual Restaurant.  but all that aside, the food=wow!!!

Took my fiance here for her birthday and was not disappointed. WE were able to get a table with a few(they only have a few but if you mention it in you reservation they try to accommodate)
Being east siders, we have little Italy, so why try Italian anywhere else in the city.... well we were wrong, this place was amazing and have a great wine list on top of it. My fiance had the lobster risotto special, which came with at least a 1.5 pound lobster tail. I had the TAGLIATELLE AL MARE which was fantastic. We also shared the eggplant app which was delicious. Highly recommend coming here for the view as well as the food. You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Usually love this restaurant but we had reservations at 745 and waited one hour to get seated. They did not apologize either. The food is amazing but the customer service is lacking."}
{"text":"awesome views of the cleveland skyline, modern decor and an open kitchen the inside of Luca is sexy....granite, slate, dark woods and large windows on old bricked wall....but the food, i don't know, it was good, but not great. our party of 4 went through the courses, apps, salads, entrees and dessert, so we had a wide variety of different plates to sample from. i had the salmon carpaccio for my appetizer, topped with capers and red onion.....the salmon was beautifully sliced thin, so thin it stuck to the plate, as it should, but it was missing something......my beet salad was delicious! sprinkled with pistachios, lightly dressed with bits of a cheese that was similar to a toscano cheese. my grilled berkshire pork chop topped with mushrooms and a gorgonzola cream sauce was good, but a bit salty and on the dry side. my server never asked how i wanted the pork prepared, which should have been cooked to a medium doneness, not well done and dry. our cheesecake dessert was light and fluffy, which i wasn't a fan of, i prefer a more dense style cream cheese based cheesecake, not one made of ricotta.......
overall, for the most part, food was good, but for some reason just not memorable, service was adequate, friendly and prompt.
i'd go back again to give it a second chance.....location and views are the selling point here.........."}
{"text":"I don't think I've been more disappointed. I had high expectations from the reviews and pictures. I question anyone who rated this place well. You can scroll down and find a woman who agrees with my assessment of the lobster risotto, and yet she still gave the place five stars? Which pretty accurately describes why I picked up the vibe of a bunch of 40+ somethings who felt important because they were paying a lot for their food and surrounded by men with sports coats.

-1 Nearly forced valet, lot not available for anyone not using valet. I figured it would be like that considering the price point, but some type of warning or sign would of been nice before entering the alley.

+1 Ordered two drinks at the bar and showed up early for my reservation. My Manhattan was perfect in the sense of it tasted how a classic Manhattan should. Sat immediately at my reservation time. Decor and presentation was nice. The lattuga salad was really good, mostly because the gorgonzola was crazy good. Others have talked about a gorgonzola dish, I could see why they would like it.

-1 I expectrf more authentic Italian but the entrees were very American, lots of protein, heavy and large portions. This isn't exactly a bad thing so let me explain the issue.

Traditionally it is my understanding that Italian dishes are more focused on small plates; typically ordering an appetizer, a vegetable ( typically a salad ), a pasta, and then secondi. This is exactly how Sotto in Cincinnati served their dishes which I found very authentic and delicious. It would be very difficult to eat la pasta and secondi which is why I found the menu very misleading and disappointing. 

-1 Like most overpriced restaurants, server was just trying to make sure is spent $$$ for a bigger tip instead of making sure I had a good experience. I explained that my date and I wanted to split a 4-course meal and share our plates. I saw the portions and they seemed large which is why I asked if this would be appropriate. Server assured me this was perfect. The appetizer and salad were very small, which was ok but didn't really match the entree sizes. 

One of the dishes I was interested in and wanted to split was the special of the day, Lobster Risotto. The price wasn't listed and so i should of asked.... It rang  out on my ticket as a single entree charge of $60. This seemed really high, even for this place considering a filet is $40. Pretty sure he just charged me for 2 risottos and gave me two risottos... but then just made it look like one because that's what I asked for. If you can't split the dish properly because the lobster is still on the tail... none of which was explained to me... then just be honest and say it isn't really a dish to be split. I'd be much happier then to be charged for 2 dishes when I think I'm getting 1.

I  ended up ordering too much food which was irritating because I specifically asked if this might be too much food and he assured me it was just right. Neither of us finished the risotto and we barely touched the secondi. Secondi was the orange duck.

-1 I thought the risotto was lack luster. I've had much better for 1/3 of the price. I always want risotto that is rich in flavor and creamy... I believe this is what makes risotto risotto, which this was neither. I expected the risotto cooked in a rich lobster broth and if it was I couldn't tell. Just a decent, borderline under-cooked rice, with a nice lobster tail on top.

-1 The duck was underwhelming. I wish the fruit notes were stronger, or there was more sauce. If duck is going to be the star and not the surrounding flavors, at least cook it right. Duck is considered to be a red meat! but was treated as a dark white meat, a safe dish that will hold moisture even if you cook the hell out of it.

Great place if you want to look and or feel like you have money. Also great if you want to feel apart of \"high-class\" society. Price not worth the food though, I would of had a better experience at a chain."}
{"text":"Love the location you get a great view of the downtown Cleveland. I ordered the bone in veal shank which was so delicious and tender. My favorite part of it was the bone marrow (my god was that heaven). One thing I would change is the appetizers I didn't like the options."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Luca! Homemade fresh amazing pasta and ingredients. Knowledgable and pleasant staff.  Always a fantastic experience. We usually go here for special occasions. The parking situation is a nightmare since it is a hidden gem at the end of an apartment/condo complex. You should def valet."}
{"text":"Just got home from our second trip to Luca. I must say we were all extremely impressed. The food was out of this world and the space itself is fantastic. You have views of downtown and the flats, beautiful brick walls, and the lighting is perfect. They have actual works of art from Picasso and Michelangelo...for sale. Michelangelo...as in this piece of art was made in 1509. But even if they didn't have any of that, it is still worth going. The highlight was the ravioli al tartufo bianco. Though it is a pasta, the server suggested it as an appetizer. It was a perfect way to start the meal. Rich, flavorful, and delicious! The truffle came though perfectly. It really was a knockout dish. The orecchiette was also killer. Oh my sausage! So flavorful! Okay, I'm getting tired...you get the idea. Oh and try the salted caramel cheesecake. Don't mess around, go eat at Luca!"}
{"text":"We took my dad here for his 60th b-day celebration.  The staff were extremely friendly and made for a great experience.  But, I would say the food and wine experience was just OK - definitely not amazing or memorable.  Limited vegetarian options (which was a downer for me, OK for my family members).  But, not worth the price and would have preferred a Little Italy Italian dining experience.  

Also parking was a pain - if you don't valet, you have to self park really far away.  Not ideal in the winter."}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic modern Italian. Could have been Milan. Try it. And did I mention the service? Perfect. Engaging. Polite. Efficient. Mind reader."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour with some very opinionated co-diners. Every one of us left utterly shocked at how amazing the food was. The price is incredible, the food is fantastic, the drinks are great. Service was very good. Bar was full when we came in, so they opened up a table for us to enjoy their happy hour specials. I will definitely come back. If there was a sixth star, I'd give it."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food in Cleveland! Great place to go if you are celebrating a special occasion, or just looking for really good authentic Italian. The restaurant is more on the fancy side, and great for date nights. I went here the first time with my parents and boyfriend, and sat in one of the big booths towards the front by the bar. We had good views out the window, and our server was great. 

I had the pappardelle bolognese which was amazing! My parents tried the ossobuco, which was slow roasted to perfection. Our table also split a selection of desserts, but I was too stuffed to try them. The portions are very generous! I now know you can order half portions of pasta, although I did enjoy my leftovers. 

The second time I went I ordered the special of spaghetti and meatballs, and was disappointed. The sauce was bland and lacked flavor.. but my first meal was so delicious that I will give it another try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic CLE views on a beautiful summer night mixed with one great taste after another. Took advice of waiter with appetizer of a pasta dinner, Sachetti. Wow, what a fantastic dish and was shared by all at table. Diverse menu with meats, pasta and fish. Marinara sauce on halibut included olives and capers. Very enjoyable. Finished with fantastic cup of cappuccino and terra mousse. 

An unexpected special evening with family. Really like the combination of great views with go above the norm effort on the food."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, however I do not like to be treated like a second class citizen just because we didn't have reservations.  We called from the car at 5:30 to say we would be there at 5:45 and when we walked in we were given a table in the back corner and told all of the better tables were for their \"reservations\".  When we left a 7:15 there still 7 of the 20 nice tables open and they had not been seated the entire time we dined.  When we were leaving the hostess said she had people arriving any minute for those tables.  Play those games with someone who doesn't spend $200 for two adults and a child. So disappointed in being treated like a second class citizen.  Food was very good, but I would recommend you spend your money somewhere where they treat you like you are valuable when you are standing right in front of them."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and the entire experience was amazing! We started with the calamari and sacchetti- both were amazing but the sachetti is a must! My husband got the filet and he loved it, while I got the linguine with clams and shrimp.. it was amazing! Our waiter was awesome and made excellent recommendations. I highly recommend this place! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Oh wow.  Just wow.   There probably aren't enough adjectives to describe adequately the food and atmosphere here.  

The view -- at least of the bridges and Cuyahoga river can't be beat, even when it's dark outside.  The restaurant itself has a minimalistic decor, with dark wood tables and floors, and an open ceiling with the ductwork as decoration.  

The service is okay, bordering on great, there were only a couple of servers working the night we were here, and although the place wasn't packed, toward the end of the evening, the service slowed considerably.  

One of the specials that night was a seafood pasta dish with a lobster tail.  How perfect was that since I was really having a pasta and a seafood craving?    Expecting only a few bites of seafood, I was completely unprepared for what I received.  Every bite of pasta had seafood.  And, with the lobster tail added, it was almost numbing.  Unfortunately, as I'm not a local, I couldn't take the leftovers.  What a waste. . . 

Everything -- the calamari appetizer, the warm bread and the desserts - were done perfectly.  Oh, and the cappucino?  It came in a regular-size cup.  Probably the biggest serving I've ever seen.

The wine list isn't a large one, but they have a nice variety and at all price points.

Next time, I think I'll skip the hotel food and save my appetite and calories for Luca's."}
{"text":"Wow what a great experience.  I left Cleveland years ago.  On my recent trip I found Luca.  The location is fantastic with amazing views overlooking the Lake, and the City skyline.  I very respectable wine list that is modestly priced.  the food is exactly on point!  I had the crab-stuffed flounder which was the catch of the day special.  another in our party had another of the daily specials Boar...slow cooked all day, served with risotto.  the service was good...the ambiance provided live music with a vocalist singing all the old Sinatra and other Italian classics.  If you are looking to impress someone or just enjoy a top notch meal...Luca Italian Cuisine.  you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!! Had the lobster risotto....amazing! Waitress...amazing!!! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Omg the best Italian food I have ever Eaten. We will be back and back again. I can't wait to actually have dinner here. The happy hour was amazing can't imagine that the main menu can in any way disappoint. Thanks s maybe my cheers place where everyone knows our name. I'm impressed amazed and can't wait to come back. Roger at the bar thank you for an awesome 1st expression. You will see us again."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. For cocktails, I had their Manhattan and it was perfectly made. For starters - the calamari and also the artichoke hearts stuffed with crab and fried - that was amazing. Split the beet salad which was nice and light. Entrees, my wife and I shared the lobster ravioli and the fish special. Unbelievable meals and the decor was classy. Even my wife wanted to purchase the artwork. I'll be back and will tell everyone I know to go."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a group of colleagues in late November. The food was delicious. I had the sacchetti and really enjoyed it. My colleagues and I had excellent service by Chuck and Ann. We shared several delicious desserts. Why then did I give Luca a mediocre score? Because one of the wait staff spilled salad dressing on the back of my sweater. A colleague noticed it as we got back to our hotel. I called and left a message at the restaurant that night and did not receive a return call. My company's meetings and events team contacted the restaurant and they declined to remedy the situation. Needless to say, that outcome was disappointing."}
{"text":"My job had our Christmas party here in December 2017 and it was awesome. This review is different than the rest because our party was catered to and served privately but I can still comment on the food since the menu is the same for everyone else in the restaurant.  

I ordered a chicken dish with vegetables which was really good. I got to taste what some of my coworkers ordered and those were very tasty as well. I also ordered a non-alcoholic drink which was very refreshing. I wish I could remember the name of it but I'm typing this in March 2018. 

If you're looking for lots of flavour then this place won't disappoint you. Stay for dessert too. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Upscale environment with fresh flavorful food. The sacchetti is a must! You can get it as a appetizer portion or a whole meal. The eggplant appetizer was also good and a nice portion. The veal stuffed tortellini also tasty. Fresh bread and oil yum. Also tried the calamari as it was raved about in others reviews it wasn't bad just wasn't as great as the reviews stated. I would reccomined getting a different appetizer. Nice view with seats by the windows. Also a good happy hour at the bar with drink and appetizer specials. 

Service was good and there is valet parking that is cheap. This restraunt is good for a romantic evening, birthday dinner, anniversary etc. 

Going back for the Sacchetti and to try their chocolate martini, cannot wait!"}
{"text":"Had the Osso Buco while in town and it was the best I've ever had anywhere, including Italy.  This is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Our Waitress was rude,  our food was over cooked and dry.

The staff would come to the hallway near us to gossip and laugh about other guests eating there.

Overall terrible experience.   Do not understand why it was rate so high"}
{"text":"A truly amazing meal. Great service and even better food. Starting with the fresh baked bread to dip in an olive oil and balsamic mixture. A selection of local beers and an extensive wine list. We started with steak tartare which was a generous portion topped with a perfectly standing egg yolk. Capers and onions and greens finished it out. Very good. The special app was two soft shell crabs ($20 and worth every dime) served in a buerre bland sauce. Rich and luscious. Next we split a salad and then on the entrees. We should have had only one! The lobster risotto at $60 was simply amazing and again worth every dime. A huge lobster tail (at least 16 ounces) o top in a subtle bright yellow sauce. Claws and other pieces in the risotto itself. Our mistake was to also order the veal osso bucco. No way we could eat it all. It was excellent as well. Nice atmosphere. Nice view of the bridges and river and Lake Erie in the distance."}
{"text":"Happy hour. 5-9p Sunday. 5-7p M-F.

Happy hour is a great deal! I was very pleased with all the food - both taste and portions - and will return again soon.

Calamari. These are served sauteed, not breaded. The tomato sauce was wonderfully flavored and went great with the calamari and the warm crusty bread that was provided. 
 
Crostini. The menu lists the toppings as chef's choice. I was a bit disappointed that the chef's choice was the same as it was about 4 weeks ago, but you can't go wrong with a classic Bruschetta.
 
Penne Alla Vodka. The serving size was large! For $6 this is a great value. For one person, this is a full meal portion of food. The sauce was creamy and again wonderfully flavored. There were also pieces of Italian fennel Sausage throughout the dish.
 
Formaggio Ravioli. Three above average sized ravioli come with this dish. For a full meal you'd have to order two at least, but still the price is right. The cream sauce was thick and delicious and the ravioli well stuffed. 

While the drink portion of the happy hour menu was a bit small, just 3 red and 2 white wines, there is an extensive by the glass wine list at regular - reasonable - prices. 

I had no trouble getting a bar seat at around 5:30p Sunday, but by 7 I was pleased to see the bar full and most of the restaurant pretty full as well. Despite being busy the bartender was friendly and we were not rushed."}
{"text":"This is a true hidden gem! Located minutes away from everywhere, but tucked away from sight. Obviously, the knowledgeable locals know about this place, since it is usually packed. Reservations are a must, and be aware that valet is really your only option (but at only $5, you can't really complain). The inside of the place is incredible. The views are awe inspiring. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. The service is impeccable! I love that you can tell that the staff is all friends/family. I've been here twice now, and everything I've ordered has been perfect. My favorite appetizer is the filet mignon tartare. It hits all the right spots on your taste buds. My favorite entree so far is the boar osso bucco. Holy moly, it literally melts in your mouth! This is a great place for special occasions. Go with the ones you love and enjoy yourself!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Ambiance is on point, service is on point, and the food.... incredible. I went with my family on my birthday. I got the sacchetti which is delicious and I highly recommend. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. My brother got filet mignon which was delicious and perfectly cooked and seasoned. My dad got the branzino which they filet tableside and he loved it. I don't remember what everyone else got but everyone was happy. We got the creme brûlée for dessert which was also delicious. Overall a wonderful experience and I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Visited w friends on recent Saturday night for a celebration. I had never heard of Lucas. Our friends booked it, and the only available seating was the 4 seasons patio. It was pleasant and comfortable. 
Food was amazing. My wife has the lobster ravioli, I had the AMAZING Sacchetti Al Tartufo Bianco. Words are lost. Truly an inspired dish. Full of flavor, perfectly prepared. For $30, I was not \"full\" but from an experience standpoint I certainly was. I would order again and again. 
Beginning to end an enjoyable evening. We will return!"}
{"text":"Theeee best Italian food in Cleveland. Hands down. Nothing else even comes close to comparing. Fresh house-made pastas... Which you can't even find in most restaurants in Cleveland's Little Italy. I have brought many friends and family members here and everyone has fallen in love with this place. It's a must!"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect from the first steps in, gazing out the window at the beautiful views of Cleveland off the West Bank.  I fell in love with this view so much, I decided to move into the Stonebridge Waterfront Apartments, right across from the impeccable Luca.

Though it can be challenging to locate initially, once you do, you're golden.  $5 Valet Parking and worth every penny not to stress about your car in downtown Cle.

The hostess was so pleasant and welcomed us to wait in the bar as our table was made for a group of 6.  We had a nice little section next to the outdoor patio and though we could not fully see the view at that point, we were surrounded by enjoyable company and were able to go for a walk onto the terrace afterwards.

The Sacchetti Al Tartufo Bianco was literally MELT IN YOUR MOUTH delicious.  The table had gotten a few apps and this was the one I picked and everyone was IN LOVE with it.  Creamy.  Cheesy.  Smooth.  Delicious.  My mouth is watering again.  Oh no!

The salads are nice and fresh and very earthy.  Dressing was sweet yet simple.  A nice palate cleanser before the rich Italian coming our way.

I had the Cavatelli Al Forno and it was just steaming when it arrived.  It was so fresh and so pleasant looking that waiting for it to cool down was a serious battle for me, but oh my gosh was it worth it.  The hot fresh pasta and sauce and fontinella cheese which brushed my lips was just to die for.  I was having such a romantic experience with this pasta dish alone.  With Italian food this good, who needs a lover?

I cannot stress how amazing this place is.  Yes, it is a bit expensive but totally worth it for a wonderful treat to yourself.  I'm kind of scared about how my pocket book is going to end up while living literally right outside of Luca's doors."}
{"text":"This location has had it's fair share of turnaround.  My expectations coming in, were average at best.

Interestingly enough, I was thrilled what I actually experienced!

We came for Restaurant week and after much consideration, decided to stick to the Fixe menu.  Out came soup, salad, steak and salmon.  Everything was well presented and just delicious!  Our service was excellent and even the desert (Tiramasu) was over the top.  I enjoyed the decor and would absolutely be back!  

There also isn't a better view in town!"}
{"text":"Luca is an ideal upmarket Italian spot to take guests when you want to show Cleveland off--sweeping views of the viaduct and the downtown skyline, beautifully crafted food, and extremely competent waitstaff.  My only caution is that if you are hoping for a quiet, intimate ambiance, Thursday night happy hour is not your night.  Friends and I came for an early dinner at 5:30, and by 6pm, the live music had begun and the place was swarming with singles ready to mingle.  The shift in the vibe over the course of 30 minutes was like night and day, and I much preferred the more subdued environment.

Mary, our exceedingly professional and efficient server, brought us quality table bread, still-warm, to tempt our appetites.  Starter rings of calamari were served in a tomato garlic broth--very tender but overall a bit too acidic for my palate.  The mythic sachetti (pasta parcels with ricotta and a fig and truffle cream sauce) lived up to their reputation.  Rich stuff, but how delicious, tempered with a few sprigs of fresh cress.  The gnocchi with tomato sauce was also a hearty skillet-ful enhanced further by the freshly grated parmesan cheese from the large master chunk carried around by the server--make it rain, Mary, make it rain! 

If you are dining on a weekday, I would HIGHLY recommend taking advantage of their half portions of pasta (not offered on the weekends).  You will still get an ample serving, and still have room for dessert.  The chocolate mousse was well-balanced, not overly sweet, and the homemade gelato du jour, decked out with an orchid garnish, tasted of gorgeous roasted pistachios.

I will happily add Luca's to my list of Cleveland \"treat meals\".  The food is worth the splurge, especially if you can manage to reserve a time when the place isn't quite so boisterous."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance and service.  Pasta dishes were delicious but entrées were lukewarm .  All and all would definitely recommend and visit again! Difficult to find!  So research your directions ahead of time."}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple: one of if not the best happy hour in Cleveland. Delicious food, great drinks and the view doesn't hurt either. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Wonderful attentive service and delicious food!  We had a wonderful date night. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys amazing food and a romantic and intimate atmosphere.  The mousse al cioccolato, will bring tears to your eyes.  Absolutely divine!  If I were on death row, the ravioli di aragosta would definitely be my last meal! Exquisite!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants I've ever been to. They have valet service and reservations readily available. The Sacchetti is to DIE FOR. You HAVE to get it."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, however my last time here really stood out. My husband and I came late on a Thursday. The servers did not rush us or showed that they were closing soon. Our server was very attentive, answered all of our questions, and gave great recommendations. We were treated very well and that's what made this Lucca experience special. We orders the Sacchetti, which was delicious. We also ordered the homemade Tiramisu to finish off our meal, it was nice. The drinks are always great here. The food was good but the service is what blew us away. We'll be back! Nice work Lucca!"}
{"text":"Excellent date place! 

I loved our waiter Chuck! Such a fun personality, made me feel like we were kindred spirits. From pre-reading yelp reviews and looking at the menu before hand, I already knew what I wanted to order (lobster ravioli or the Vitella Tortellini )veal stuffed tortellini)). My date ordered the lobster ravioli, so I went forth and ordered the tortellini. As Chuck was starting to write, he looked up at me and said \"that's not what you want\". I was a little taken aback but interested to hear what he was advocating. He made it a surprise and man, he totally nailed it. It was called \"Sacchetti al tartufo bianco\"which was basically white truffle and ricotta stuffed sachetti in a tartufata cream sauce, drizzled with a balsamic glaze! It had sweet, salty and decadent flavors. Standing up with a slow clap. This meal was just bellisimo. My date had the The ravioli di aragosta (lobster ravioli) which was striped with squid ink, swimming in a tomato cream sauce with generous portions of lobster both in the ravioli and around the sauce! 

The ambiance itself was quite romantic. Gorgeous views of the water. We sat in a booth right next to the kitchen so it was a little loud. This was definitely a meal that goes down in the books though.

Parking: $5 valet or park in the neighborhood."}
