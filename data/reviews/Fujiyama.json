{"text":"Located in the Latta Arcade, Fujiyama Japanese Restaurant offers a limited menu.  But do you really need more choices? The Mrs. prefers the teriyaki veggie rice with extra rice.  Yum! Whether you phone ahead or order in person, this Japanese take-out place offers quickly-prepared, abundant food for a decent price.  They have been in this location for at least a couple of decades and are still popular. The Mrs. recommends Fujiyama. ."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like it after reading the reviews on several sites. Came here for lunch today for the first time. Ordered the \"Bibimbap\" after reading the review on charlottefive.com... Did not like it. Tasted weird and the portion size was joke. Not going back here, too many other options to choose from in the area."}
{"text":"I got the fried rice with beef, and it was so-so.  I've had better.  The restaurant was decent andthe staff was friendly and fast.  But the food was just ok, and I have to admit that while I was eating it I was a little worried if I would get sick or not.   But to be fair the other people I was eating with loved their food.  I heard the tempura vegetables were great.  Unfortunatley my experience was just mediocre. Thats the way it goes though, but  I will give them another shot , roll with the punches and try a different dish.  I'll keep you posted."}
{"text":"one extra star because they are consistent, well priced and chicken tempura and chicken teriyaki are tastey. this is my go to spot when i want something cheap and \"asian\""}
{"text":"Headed over during lunch time for their lunch special. Easily the best price for the food you get. Looks like only one lady was working so it took a bit of time, which is nbd, but if you're in a hurry be prepared to wait it out. Beef and chicken teriyaki was really good. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot, with tasty food, made fresh to order. I got the Combo Beef and Chicken, and it comes with plain white rice and a kind of weird salad concoction, like half Iceberg lettuce and half cole slaw, with a semi-sweet dressing. Not the biggest portions ever served but satisfying enough. Decent flavors but not really comparable to othe Uptown Asian places as this is more of a \"Mom and Pops\" place which I do like. The Asian lady behind the counter is a one woman show, as she takes the orders and cooks right in front of you. It's all take out but I guess you could eat at the small counter they do have.  I read other reviews speaking of fried rice....well I wasn't given that option, and I definitely would have opted for that. The menu is extremely limited....makes sense since the Asian \"wonder woman\" does it all back there. But egg rolls would be nice.  All in all a decent lunch option in Uptown."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always fresh and hot! Most of the time I get the chicken/combo teriyaki . Today I decided to try something different the Korean bbq! It's so delicious! I would definitely get this again"}
{"text":"Good and cheap, especially for Uptown. Lunch for $7.50 or so, including tax, ain't nothing to be sneezed at!  They're also very fast - even with three or four people in front of me, I have my food and am out the door in ten minutes or less.  Not haute cuisine by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a delicious source of protein and carbs in the middle of the day.  Nice location, friendly people, excellent price."}
{"text":"Does the job for quick and fast, fresh teriyaki lunch box. Downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good food and pretty darn cheap. Not really Japanese, more Korean. $7.50-$8 for a meal in uptown, which is great.  I recommend the chicken teriyaki which is $6.50.  Comes with rice and a small side salad (mostly lettuce but not bad).  The owners are very friendly and this place is fast.  Please note - this is only take out and there is no seating.  The food is to go in styrofoam boxes.  Updating the review now with the Bimimbap.  it is excellent.  I highly recommend it.  A delicous mix of veggies, meat and rice.  It comes with soup as well. Very good!"}
{"text":"The Bi Bim Bap was delicious! Lots of veggies and delicious sprouts. I got mine with chicken and sesames sprinkled on top. The red pepper paste is good and spicy, and it comes with rice and a side of soup for only about $8. The people were really nice. I'm happy to have some tasty, quick Korean food nearby the office and I will definitely be going back. It's in the far right corner of Latta Arcade and like most places there, you take your food to go and eat elsewhere. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch on a typical, busy weekday. Ordered bibimbab and pon mondu to go. There were about 5 people ahead of me. I waited maybe five minutes or less for fresh cooked food. I walked back to the office to eat and was very pleased with the food, flavor, sauces, and presentation. Everything was really very good. They have me a ton of rice, miso soup, and a big bowl of meat and veggies. The pon mondu is kind of like a gyoza cooked in a pan. All-in-all this is a good place to grab a relatively inexpensive lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, healthy food. Not really Japanese, more Korean. $6.50-$8 for a meal in uptown, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I actually stop by here a couple times a month for a quick (usually), flavorful, and plentiful lunch at an affordable price ($6-7).  Towards the end of the Latta Arcade, it can get full at the lunch hour, thus having to wait 15 min or so since there is only one cook, a super nice lady! However, once in a while I opt for the bibimbap.  It's tasty and mixes things up from the usual chicken/beef teriyaki combo.  The combo meals also come with a sweet vinegar over lettuce, making the teriyaki and rice a little more healthy.  They also serve a delicious brown rice substitute at no extra cost. Umm, yes, thank you.  No seating inside, so take out only."}
{"text":"Found this gem while looking for good Asian food for a quick lunch. I have since ordered two different things: the bibimbap and the teriyaki combo with chicken and beef ($7.75 and $7 respectively)  This is a unpretentious place with minimal seating and decoration. However, the owners (who said they've been here for 20 years, by far the oldest restaurant in the arcade area), make up for the modesty with their service and kindness. They're fast and so sweet.   As for the food, the bimbimbap does its job. Nothing fancy, but has all the veggies you'd expect in bibimbap-mushrooms, carrots, mixed greens, bean sprouts and also comes with a side of sweet/spicy gochujang sauce. For only $7.75, I'd say it's a great deal.   The chicken/beef teriyaki combo was alright. Nothing special but still a good deal for its price. I'd say it needs a bit more sauce.   Overall a great, quick place to get your Asian lunch fix. I'd order the pork Katsu or the bibimbap over the teriyaki, but that's just me!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and good portions for the price."}
{"text":"Been fortunate enough to walk here from time to time and have sampled most of their dishes including their staple, teryaki chicken hibachi and the new menu addition, bibbymap.  The dishes come with white rice and a basic salad with some light vinagrette dressing.  The food is good, not great.  The service is also good, and the nice lady that works there springs into action the moment she's called upon.  The other factor making this place a good option for lunch is it's location right in Latta Arcade.    Food is good, service is good, location, also good - but 4 stars good?  no.  Not at all.  The reason it does in fact get 4 stars is because of the value.  For less than $7 per lunch, you're walking out of there with a good experience, good food, and it happens fast.    I'd love to see some occassional seasonal or straight up menu changes from time to time, but pretty much every little food joint in Latta is limited to what they can actually offer.  It is what it is - if you want a decent value hibachi for less than $7, that's the spot.  Don't expect to struggle with menu decisions."}
{"text":"Reasons for 5 stars: 1.  Uptown lunch=6 bucks.  that's freaking awesome 2.  Nice staff/owners/customer service- very friendly, insanely fast 3.  The tempura chicken = Adult happy meal...was the best feeling ever to be 6 again with chicken nuggets and bbq sauce..plus the rice and salad...awesome  4.  I genuinely liked the food.    The staff was also fast and friendly.  I would take this over the superyuppified trendy salad place"}
{"text":"Very good value for the food. They give you a lot of meat for what you paid for. The teriyaki is really Korean Bul-gol-gi"}
