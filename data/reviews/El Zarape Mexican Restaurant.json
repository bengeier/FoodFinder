{"text":"De vacaciones alas vegas encontramos este restaurant muy cerca del luxor donde estábamos hospedados y nos encanto el sabor y la atención grasias a María Raúl y Rafael regresamos a los días siguientes  llevando a mi hermana y mi cuñado y quedaron satisfechos toda la comida rica les recomiendo todo"}
{"text":"Great place, excellent food and wonderful service. Authentic food served in a great and welcoming atmosphere. Definitely coming back when in town!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a big variety of options to chose from. The food is delicious. I ordered the carne asada burrito and i loved it. Thank you guys"}
{"text":"I like that it's close to work. Very reasonable priced and very authentic. I'll keep coming back for more. I absolutely love this place. Service is great, they are all very nice."}
{"text":"Outside it looks similar to an adobe building but the moment you walk inside the restaurant, you will see there isn't a lot of space to accommodate many people. There is about 4-5 small tables inside and perhaps at least 3-4 tables arranged outdoor. The restaurant is open for breakfast. And lunch hour is usually their busiest time. They offer breakfast and lunch combo plates, and they have a selection of burritos, tortas, tacos, quesadillas, seafood, and soup. Also they make specialty drinks like Horchata, Limonada, Tamarindo, and Jamaica.

I chose the Grilled Chicken Fajitas combo plate ($8.99) which include tender chicken stir fry with green pepper, onion, tomato, and is serve with Spanish rice, refried beans, a small salad, sour cream and guacamole. The Chicken Fajitas include tortillas, you have a choice of flour or corn. I prefer corn tortilla, and I like that they serve it warm. The salsa verde is mild and it's not too spicy. I can tell the food is freshly made, the meat and vegetables are so flavorful, and everything in my combo plate taste amazing! Also I tried the Champurrado ($2.50), it's a thick Mexican Hot Chocolate, it has corn flour, cinnamon, clove, and star anise which gives out a calm and comforting flavor. The drink is serve hot and it's very satisfying.

They do have friendly and fast service. The person who place my order is Maria, and she made sure to check in with every customer. Price is reasonable and you can afford to order more. The staff is quick to make the food and it is delivered within 10-15 minutes. So far this restaurant is now my go-to spot for Real Authentic Mexican Fast Food."}
{"text":"I have nothing but GREAT things to say about The overall restaurant! My family and I came to Vegas for a few days from San Diego. We decided to stop by Saturday morning. As soon as you walk in we got received by a very nice boy, he was knowledgeable and very nice. He took down our order and recommended the birria. I got the birria, my mom tamales, dad torta. It took no more then 7min to get our food !! I mean it's Vegas everywhere we went took 25-35min! Already impressed! The food was AMAZING !!! warm, tasteful, portion was great! Overall amazing food ! The owner came out to greet us very very nice told us his story of how he opened his restaurant and was just humble about everything. Before we left he gave us a phone grip that had the restaurants name ! I loved it ! Such a nice touch !"}
{"text":"Was visiting from LA need menudo ASAP found best small spot ever for a reasonable gave it 5 stars"}
{"text":"This is my new go to mexican spot all the food is amazing. The chilaquiles are awesome, so are the tortas, its all authentic homemade tasting good. Everything is decent priced too."}
{"text":"Located right off the strip this restaurant was easy to get to. Service was quick and the breakfast burritos were amazing . Just what we needed. Authentic, cheap , and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town! Greatest customer  service around and not to mention, cheap prices."}
{"text":"Great food. I was pleased with the flavor of the menudo and birria. The directions are a little off Bc it's actually a little hole in the wall behind the address directions on map quest in an Industrial area."}
{"text":"El Zarape restaurant has very delicious food and very inexpensive, we ordered tamales de pollo (chicken tamale) and a tamal de puerco ( pork tamale) and omg, the chicken tamale was super, super good, we also got camarones rancheros (shrimp in ranchero sauce) and they were delicious, my other half got some huevos rancheros ( eggs in ranchero sauce) and this dish didn't disappointed us either. We're from Los Angeles, and next time we come.back to Las Vegas, we will definitely come back to El Zarape to indulge ourselves again. Gracias!!"}
{"text":"Great place if you're looking for authentic Mexican food.  Prices are very reasonable. Had the carne asada and it was delicious.  Rice and beans were good.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in here wanting some good MEXICAN...tried different spots around the area and always saw this place on my way to work. Let me tell you the reviews don't lie amd neither do I when I tell you this is aa authentic Mexican food as you're gonna get with out going back home. Had the birria combo... BOMB!! Wifey/roommate had the torta de pierna. ...BOMB!!! my lil one had the tamal de puerco BOMB!!!  Everything in here is good customer service is friendly and very welcoming and jokes around I liked that!!!"}
{"text":"Menudo is great  but the burritos are small and only had a few pieces of meat (mostly beans and rice)."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I was looking for. Cheap good .clean great service. They have chips and salsa. Agua fresca. A lot of parking is worth the drive took me 10min off the strip. 

The owner is such a great guy and the lady i  the registry is nice too"}
{"text":"Found this delicious place on yelp and I have to say that the 5 stars are on point! We are a big family and had a chance to taste a lot of delicious meals.  We had Birria, red spicy and non-spicy chilaquiles, machaca, chorizo con huevos, chile verde, green tamale, and pozole! Everything was excellent! My 11 year old said \"It was really good!\" The chef came out to greet us and was a true gem! The young lady who served us was very pleasant too. Definitely recommend if you are looking for authentic food."}
{"text":"I came here for the steak, egg, cheese and bean breakfast burrito. I'll keep coming back for the hospitality, the guy who takes orders is the best! He will come to your table to see if everything is good and will have a small chat.

Also, MENUDO Everyday!!! Need I say more? This is coming from a menudo fanatic - no, not the band."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Great little place.  It didn't disappoint,  their food is delicious. The menudo was amazing, it hit the spot, nothing better than great menudo to cure the hangover.  This is real homemade authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is small but the FOOD is VERY good...we came 2 days straight...I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I accidentally ran across them about a month ago and now go there at least twice a week for their homemade pork tamales. They have excellent tacos too. Their red salsa is really flavorful and delicious. Maria the counter lady is always very nice. Shout out to Raul too for putting out such good food."}
{"text":"Tires of all the usual lunch places around here so decided to try some place different. This is a hole in the wall that started out as a Thai place that went nowhere. I recently saw some signs of live here and good reviews of the place. Tried it out. The tamales plate was really good. Well seasoned tamales. Rice and refried bean complimented the entree nicely. Second time there I had the Chile Verde plate. It was a very large portion. Very tasty sauce for dipping the soft tortillas. The salsa for the chips tasted different and very good. My friend had the carne asada. He liked it both times we were there. Reasonable prices. Less than 23 bucks for two plates plus drinks. I think we are moving from Los Lupes."}
{"text":"What a cozy cute restaurant!! The food is excellent and the atmosphere is just so nice.  I love going there!  They are going to open a new location on Sahara and Jones soon I can't wait to go there!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The tacos were on point. It's located in an industrial area off Arville and Hacienda. They do have signage on the street directing you to their shop. Walking in, it's very small. There are a few tables inside and a walk up counter, but you can also call your order in for pickup.

I ordered the taco combo which comers with 3 tacos, rice and beans, but I was hangry so I ordered an extra taco and fideo soup. The tacos I tried were asada and pastor, both yummy, but I liked the pastor better. I was given two squirt bottles of sauce, one green and one red. The green was mild and paired well with the tacos. The red was tasty too, but a little spicy as reds tend to be. The food came out quickly and tasted fresh and delicious. I am looking forward to returning and trying their other items."}
{"text":"La comida está DELICIOSA!!! Los camarónes ala díabla están riquísimos y picositos, pero lo mejor el pozole está muy muy rico igual que los Chiles reyenos. TODO esta RICO. Buenos precios pero la verdad el lugar está muy limpio y lo mejor de comida mexicana en Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the spot for Great Mexican food! I would recommend this place for any time of the day"}
{"text":"Awesome family-style food and welcoming service that makes me feel right at home.  I can't wait for this hidden gem to have a sister location, opening soon closer to downtown."}
{"text":"Love the torta cubana, with a cold mexican coke. I visit about 3 times a month and never dissapoints."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times now with some mixed results. It's very small inside most the customers were Hispanic, which usually is a good sign in my opinion but, I couldn't locate a bathroom to inspect for cleanliness.

I loved their Breakfast Burrito with Ham, Cheese, Eggs and Refried Beans it was mouthwateringly delicious. I want to try their 3 meat Breakfast Burrito next time.

(thumbs up on their Red Salsa as well it's muy bueno it had lots of flavor)! 
(thumbs down on the Salsa Verde though it's bland)

I took off a star for their Chili Relleno Burrito, the Beans and Rice were good but the Chile Relleno itself was under cooked and hard to chew the cheese not melty and the Sour Cream I ordered and paid extra to be added wasn't to be found with a magnifying glass...

I took off another Star for their Chorizo Breakfast Burrito, it was mostly okay but something inside was over cooked and burnt. I was eating it in a very dark room so I couldn't tell if it was the Chorizo or the Eggs...disappointing."}
{"text":"Authentic, clean and fresh hole in the wall. What a surprise! The service was great and the food was delicious. Have to try the Tortas."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant a few days ago, the food was really good it had the homemade taste that you get when you eat at a mom & pop restaurant, I enjoyed the bandera language burrito;from the minute we stepped inside Angel made us feel welcome and was very helpful  with his suggestions, food and service are definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place is bomb bomb!!! hole in the wall but worth it...portions are also big enough to share and super inexpensive.. had the birria omg the flavor is on point truly recommended... also ordered torta ahogada which is huge and tasty.. tricolor burrito carnitas was flavortown delish... authentic Mexican  food I truly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever 
And the service was excellent 
They asked us if everything was ok if we need something else
 
Servicio excelente la comida deliciosa  
Recomiendo ampliamente"}
{"text":"Party hard last night and you need that Menudo to hit the spot? This is the place!!! Mom and pop shop with the type of service that feel like you are at your gamdmas house. Food is fresh to order and you can expect quality. Will definitely be coming back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was DELICIOUS. By far the best chilaquilles I have ate. This restaurant is a hiden gem just 6 mins away from the strip. The manager or owner (older man) was very attentive to his customers. I wish they were open after 3pm bc we would have been back for dinner. We will definitely be back! Inexpensive delicious food, what more can ypu ask for in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service! After
A rough night of celebrating we had pozole and it was very good. This will be a place we come back to every time we are in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Had a few people tell me this place was good , so I gave it a try. I walked in and was greeted by a nice lady. Prices are great , and the place is clean which is always a bonus. I had some carnitas tacos and a asada mulita... both were super tasty with plenty of flavor . There salsa was super good also, not to liquidity just perfect. Update: been here 3 times now. There carne asada burrito was on point along with there pork tamale ... Give this place a try, lots of things on the menu, looking forwards to trying more things ."}
{"text":"Menudo was great! Enjoying a cold brew along with it. Really nice people! Really helpful  and courteous."}
{"text":"Bomb cheap Mexican food! Try this place right now!  I just devoured the Torta Cubana which was the best torta I've ever had. Top five things I've ever eaten for sure. The nice older lady that runs the place reminds me of my grandma, who has always had dangerous skills making Mexican food, probably spent most of her life in the kitchen. This is my favorite restaurant at the moment. I have a goal to try everything on the menu. lol"}
{"text":"Buen servicio, y la comida no se diga deliciosa....proximo viaje a las vegas ,aqui voy a echar taco..."}
{"text":"This place is so good come now tamales con pork is so good gotta have the torta de pierna the sauce is bomb gotta have it so come on down to EL  ZARPAE MEXICAN RESTAURANT  SOOOOOOO GOOD"}
{"text":"When in Vegas venture out and try the mom and pop restaurants. 

From our visit this is what I gathered:
The Zarape is a family owned restaurant and you can see dad working the kitchen and the children working the floor. The location is a bit hidden but easy to get to  from the strip. Food is reasonably price for the size portions. 

The menudo was delish. It has a great homemade taste and I like that it has hominy in it. I do however wish they had that oil salsa you see in a lot of pozole/menudo places for that extra kick.

The green chilaquiles were the right amount of spiciness to get your Saturday morning going.

Tamarind water was perfect to wash every down.

The asada burrito was a bit on the blah side. Nothing to rave about. The asada fell short."}
{"text":"Pretty good chilequiles. Should be served on a bigger plate with rice and some vegetables. Beans are ok. Overall food temp luke warm, not hot as it should be. Will try again."}
{"text":"Buffets in Vegas are over rated when it comes to Mexican food. This is the best place to have breakfast when your in town. It's worth driving off the Vegas strip. The menudo is delicious. My kids tried the Fideo and tamales and left no evidence left on their plates! We found a treasure coming to this place and we will definitely come again when we are in town! The family owned restaurant is very deserving of five starts."}
{"text":"Best Authentic Mexican food! Torta de pierna está riquísima y super grande!!! 
100% recomendado!"}
{"text":"This place is really affordable and really good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. Absolutely love the carne asada tacos. And they have menudo all day. Angel the owner is very nice and helpful. I highly recommend you try it out."}
{"text":"FOOD: We came here and I have to say the food was delicious. I had a ceviche, that hit the spot without a doubt. I also got their fish tacos, delicious too. Best part, I completely got my money's worth. Total with a drink? $13 (they had a special). Hole in a wall spot that I am glad we found because this is now our place to come to whenever we are in Vegas.
-
SERVICE: Our waiter was nice, very attentive, the owner came out and definitely made us feel welcomed. That is a rare thing now a days, but it's a great quality. Keep it up.
-
OVERALL: Place definitely deserves it's 5 stars, we will be coming here everytime we are in Vegas. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone in town, prices are reasonable, and you guys made our stay without a doubr. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place five starts, but they don't have help and you shouldn't charge me for chips and salsa when I had to wait 15 minutes due to such a big order in front of me. I also asked for scrambled eggs and received eggs with the yoke which I don't like but I didn't want to wait another 15 minutes. Please make homemade tortillas your food is delicious it's just you need help in the kitchen when it's a big order, and you should never charge for chips and salsa especially when you're making people wait but other than that it was really delicious next time I'm in Vegas I will return and hopefully take my advice on the chips being free."}
{"text":"Great food !!!!! Authentic Mexican food! Great customer service and will definitely come back everytime we are in Vegas ! Definitely a must stop while in Vegas"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall place, family-run, legit Mexican. We had: huarache with carnitas, sreak milanesa, chile verde and posole. All great. Very inexpensive and fast."}
{"text":"Had green chilaquiles, husband had a torta ahogada, it was delicious! A younger boy took our order, very polite, the owner accommodated our large party quickly.  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is worth finding. 
Off the beaten path but awesome Mexican food. 
The breakfast burritos are excellent. 
This is authentic and family owned and operated. 
Very clean and friendly. 
It's one of my regular stops."}
{"text":"The food here was ok, wasn't the best. But it was a good place to get a fast bite to eat. The service was super fast and fresh, but the food was not really seasoned. Employees there was also super friendly."}
{"text":"Good and tasteful food very friendly staff  they're the bests on Vegas if you like Mexican food good environment  clean and nice"}
{"text":"Really good !!! The salsas are just not spicy and the meat has a little to much fat ! Very good priced and delicious though highly recommended it !!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Fast and friendly service. Definitely family run which is always a good quality about a restaurant. My family and I were in town for the weekend and decided to stop in for breakfast. Everything we ordered was delicious  (chilaquiles rojos, birria, menudo) if you are in the area and want real Mexican food, you must stop in."}
{"text":"The go to spot. I'm out here in Vegas for work for a month, got lucky finding this place. I got my whole crew hooked on the place, now we're coming almost every morning. Amazing food, friendly staff, large variety, just all around a great spot. No complaints."}
{"text":"Love this place! I love the tacos! However, I hate the location & the hours in which they are open. All that being said this is a great place to eat at. The people are friendly and the menu has a lot of great options. 

I heard the breakfast burritos are very good! I will have to try it one day. I always get the carne asada tacos, very good! It's simple, meat, cilantro, onions & lime. 

Bad part the restaurant is kinda hidden and some homeless people in the area. Also, they close like at 3pm! I want tacos at 8pm! Ha 

Check this place out if you got time."}
{"text":"We had two breakfast burritos and they were so good that we got two more to go for our ride back to California from Las Vegas. Each burrito had eggs, potatoes, beans, salsa, and chicken with avocado. Perfectly made and so delicious! We will be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"El Zarape restaurante es uno de los mejores en las vegas tiene comida auténtica mexicana preparada en cuanto usted la ordena,precios razonables lo recomiendo al 
100  por ciento con su agradable atención especialmente por su propietario el Sr Angel y toda sus empleados 
Gracias"}
{"text":"I hit this place on the drive out of town today and next time it will probably be on the the drive in AND out of town.  If you are sensitive to salt I would ask for no salt next time as the burrito just had too much for me.  But It was good.  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked fantastic as well.  A solid place worth checking out.  They lose a star for the salt and not giving a handful of chips to go with the Burrito."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, it smelled like an authentic Mexican kitchen. This family owned business is full of great food, great staff, and great music. It's small yet cozy, and quite nostalgic for those of us who grew up in such an environment. But for those who did not grow up in this environment yet would like to indulge in the great food, THIS IS THE PLACE. All the way from Los Angeles - but we will be back."}
{"text":"Este lugar me encanto.  Esta súper cerca de Las Vegas Blvd, tiene comida auténtica Mexicana, y buen servicio a el cliente."}
{"text":"Tried the menudo. Super fresh and tasty. One of the best I've had in a while. It smelt like my moms house when we walked in. Onions and garlic yummy!!!

The menudo has a lot of tripe in it along with hominy. Definitely coming back when we come to Vegas again.

Then there is the staff. Friendly and kept checking on us. Don't let its tiny size fool you!!!"}
{"text":"I've visited El Zarape 3 times within one week. I wanted to make sure I've tried them a few times before leaving a review. I must say that since i've eaten their tacos & burritos I cannot see past them. Their chicken and assad's is seasoned to perfection and ever so tender!!! omg when you try their food you will be hooked! They are very generous with portions. The staff is super friendly. I cannot find one complaint about this place. If you're deciding on where to go to eat right now pick them... I guarantee you'll be back within a few days lol. $1.50 tacos & $5.99 huge burritos...what have you got to lose?"}
{"text":"The best food we've eaten in Las Vegas and for a fraction of the cost of subpar casino offerings. This small off strip business is doing it right with delicious food and THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE of any place we've gone yet. I had the menudo and it taste just like moms, best hangover food ever! Wonderful hole in the wall that you should come by and check out if you are here in Vegas. We are from Texas and I'm Mexican so trust me, you will not be disappointed. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ordered huevos rancheros breakfast plate and a veggie quesadilla. Everything was excellent! Even the horchata and the limonada were great!"}
{"text":"Truly authentic Mexican food. We had the menudo rojo, tacos de birria de Rez, and ceviche tostadas. We are super picky with our food, but we have no complaints. Food was absolutely delicious, hot, and atmosphere was super chill. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Ahhh ! Trying the Carnes en su Jugo brought me back to when my grandpa used to cook this. The owner is definitely a family guy. He came out to greet my friend and I. The service you receive is definitely the best in Vegas ! I will definitely start going more often ! 

Let me also mention that you do not expect amazing food for the place being so hidden ! This place is such a gem."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall that is good!!! Recommend for a nice off the strip good stuff...."}
{"text":"El Zarape is the most authentic, fresh, delicious Mexican food I have eaten in Las Vegas. Everything made fresh even the Orchata. Everyone who enjoys Mexican food should try El Zarape."}
{"text":"En el zarape restauran la comida esta rica los tacos las tortas la carnita asada todo esta rico"}
{"text":"Menudo amazing! Birria amazing! And service amazing! Impressed and will be coming again! Came from LA and found this place on yelp and was very happy coming here. Food came out fast and felt just like home cooking. Loved it !"}
{"text":"We needed some good ol Mexican food before we head home from Vegas. Husband is very picky about his pozole and menudo. We ordered both. Pozole for me, menudo for him. We were pleasantly surprised. Place is small but clean. Service was great and staff was very friendly. Owner, Angel brings you out the food and likes to chat. He's salsa was the best. A must next Time we come back to visit."}
{"text":"Stopped by due to the high reviews and wow very impressed with service and the food! Did not expect this at all and we were blown away!"}
{"text":"Birria, menudo, divorciados eggs, all delicious, a place to must go. Less than two miles from Excalibur."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic food 
This is the place!!!
The food is super delicious 
I had green chilaquilles
I will definitely come back for more super yummy food"}
