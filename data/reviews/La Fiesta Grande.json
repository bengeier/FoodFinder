{"text":"Best I have had in Charlotte highly recommended! I'll be here every Sunday I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Seriously just go grab a burrito at the BP next door and heat it yourself. This place is a joke -- and I'm not kidding :-)"}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant.  Service was excellent, food was fresh and flavorful.  Portions were good.  Prices were very reasonable.  Its a Mexican sports bar.  Perfect for any time."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican, but pretty terrible service. Our waiter brought a drink we didn't ask for and made us pay for it then was incredibly rude about it. Glad this isn't my neighborhood Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Very Yummy! kind of slow service but still very good food. I have one of the combinations and the enchiladas are very good! I tried the shrimp tacos, they were alright but not the best. well decorated and tvs all around. staff is very happy except for one older woman working the seating."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I love love their big selection of authentic Mexican dishes and they offer several different flavors of Margaritas which are all good! ( believe me, I've tried them all! ) 
The service is prompt and the servers are polite, atmosphere makes you feel like you're in Mexico with the pretty decor and live music ( serenades) .
Pricing is on par with what all they have to offer as well as the quality of the cuisine"}
{"text":"Under new management !!! Finally! Food is still great and service is now up to par. Katharine was an awesome waitress- friendly informative. For all you folks that stopped coming cause of bad service  (like us) - give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Average at best - had fajitas steak - very dry and the rice and beans were nasty.   Will not be back"}
{"text":"Terrible service, ok food. Not good enough to put up with terrible management and waitstaff.  Been 3 times and I'm done giving them chances. Los Arcos is much better."}
{"text":"Dont waste your time coming here.  We have been a couple times now...Each time saying we will give it one more chance.  That in itself shouldn't be the way you approach a restaurant.  Well tonight was the last straw.  We got there at 7:15 and no one was there to greet the line of people waiting at the front door.  The place was packed?.  We waited about 10 minutes to even be seated.  It took 20 minutes to get our drink orders in/acknowledge we had been seated, then probably another 20-30 minutes to even get those drinks.  Got our food order in and a few minutes after the same waitress that took our order asked us if we had ordered yet!  We had to go to the bar to order more drinks because no one came by to check on us.  We also had to check on the food to make sure that was even put in to the system.  It was 8:45 at this time and we had not even received our food yet!  When the food came everyone's order was right except for one person.  Ordered 3 tacos and only one came out.  We had to get up and ask for the bill because no one came to check on us...Again.  When the bill came it was all wrong.  They posted on NextDoor app stating Taco Tuesday with drink and food specials...That's not what was on the bill.  The one taco alone was $8!  2 hours at a mediocre place on a Tuesday is definitely not worth it.  We were even the last ones in there(not by choice) and they still had awful service.

The worst part of it all was no apology or anything.  The server, Pepe, just laughed after we told him what the night looked like.  He just pointed a finger at the original waitress that served us.  I don't recommend coming here.  There is another Mexican food restaurant, Los Arcos, next to Harris Teeter, maybe 2 miles down the road and they have been spot on every time we go."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever. We kept trying to remind him about are drinks then got ate apatizer wrong. We didn't get silverware till 10 min after we got ate food. When the silverware is stacked right in front of us. Starts huffing and puffing other tables are complaining about the guy. And then when we finally get tired of not getting silverware he tells my mother to not talk to her like that. I'm a server also so I understand  the struggle this was jus terrible. But the lady who replaced him was great and sweet. Love the restaurant just the server. food was still great!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant! The salsa is awesome! The margaritas are tasty, fresh and homemade. The food is delicious! It's a drive to come here but you can bet we will be frequent flyers!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, food is decent, good location. However, after our initial seating and order, the waitstaff disappeared totally until it was time to bring the check. I wanted another mojito, and my wife wanted a side dish, but no one came over. Oh well, overall better to have this Mexican themed restaurant here than to have an empty storefront."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time in a long time. Apparently there are new, much better owners. The decor is warm, inviting, and very appropriate for a Mexican restaurant. We were greeted and seated promptly. Warm chips and great fresh salsa followed. The menu is quote extensive and features all your Tex Mex favorites. We ordered two craft Margaritas. They were good but both were too sweet and not enough booze for the $10 and $11 price tags. The food is awesome! Portions are big. The meat was tender and well marinated. Plenty of leftover for lunch the next day. Overall a very pleasant experience and very happy to have a great Mexican place so close to home."}
{"text":"1st And last time here.  Parking lot seemed packed which led me to believe that it was a good place to eat.  47 minutes later still sitting here waiting for food.  Waitress has to many tables and hasn't been back by to check on us."}
{"text":"They don't have they're act together.  Service is very slow.  Food is not bad - hoping to see some improvements."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining here with my family.  Our waiter was new but he spilled an entire tray of drinks down the back of my shirt then got my order wrong.  All of that I could have dealt with IF there had even been a discount on our bill.  Absolutely no discount.  My husband had to go find someone to get him a refill on his drink so he could have something to drink with his meal.   The worst part is the severe cramping upset stomach that followed the next day.  Never eating there again.  I'm just glad my kids got chicken tenders"}
{"text":"What I really enjoy about this restaurant is their  Super Pollo dish. The chicken is tender and very juicy. Another good feature about this restaurant is their prices which are very affordable.  I also liked that the manager came up to my table to checked tomake sure my food came out alright. (I had made some modifications to my dish). Everything came out fine and at a decent time. If you're looking for a Mexican place around the Mont Holly area I highly suggest checking this guys out."}
{"text":"We stopped by after a day trip down to Charleston knowing there was nothing in the house to eat.  I had been wanting to give this place a try, but I had also heard that there had been some difficulties when they first opened, so we went in not knowing what to expect....

I was not dissappointed.  I had the Texas Burrito with grilled shrimp, steak and chicken.  The shrimp were plentiful, and tasty, not overcooked.  The steak and chicken both were well seasoned.  My wife had a veggie chimi, which we had not seen before, and some sangria.  She was very happy with both items.  Lastly, my Mother-in-Law had a grilled chicken quesadilla, which looked great, loaded full of chicken.

The service was good, but I can see that if they were super busy the wait staff could get overloaded.  I'm hoping they are a success."}
{"text":"I have become a HUGE fan of this place. 

Upon entering you are greeted with urban modern Latino southern charm all in one   The atmosphere is full of modern charm with a southern country spin and Latin music streaming across the airwaves. There's plenty of room to dine. Booths and tables to accommodate small and large parties This restaurant also has a large outdoor 

This place is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love eating on the patio at night but the past two times I've came here (I think I had the manager as a server) and he was absolutely rude. Like why are you in customer service? We ordered an appetizer, beer and split a quesadilla plate. We still had a ton of chips left (because that little thing of salsa doesn't go far) and asked for an additional salsa so that we could finish our chips with and he charged us for extra. Like I can see if someone only ordered one plate and was tearing through some salsa but come on we had an app and beer and asked for ONE additional tiny salsa which probably only cost them .50. So over that they lost two regular customers. You treat your customers right and they will continue come back to you. They must be really hurting for business if they have to pinch every penny out of you."}
{"text":"Wow, it was like the Chickfila of Mexican restaurants. Top notch service, super polite waiters and waitresses going over and beyond to make sure your experience is beyond amazing. Even in the bathroom where one of the gals was cleaning, and even another gal who had just finished her shift came by our table on her way out and greeted us goodbye. Never experienced that kind of service in a Mexican restaurant anywhere. Kudos to management!"}
{"text":"They changed owners and its under new management!!! They have all new servers and they are very sweet and friendly. Food is still amazing, great price on drinks ! If you haven't tried it in the past two months you need to!! ;)"}
{"text":"I heard ownership changed. So I decided yet again to give it a chance. I had hope that this establishment actually changed. Awful service.  Waitress polite but just not competent in the kitchen at all. I ordered hot Yucat√°n shrimp which was to come with rice and beans, habeneros, onions, tomatoes, guacamole and mushrooms.   The kitchen prepared FRENCH Fries with shrimp only after an hour and a half wait?  We were the only table in the place!  Me wife ordered Guadalajara Salad which was to be served with guacamole... again what came was not even close. Carrots and cabbage salad is what came.  All orders completely off base.  Wow! I did not know what to say??

Sadly nothing has really changed here.  

The Chicago Cubs curse has been transferred to this geographical locale. Vinnie's-you could not get silverware.  Biker sports bar with scantily clad waitresses. Mexican Place where the owners were rude and incompetent. The tradition of rudeness is gone but incompetence  continues.  I'd be happier with sausage prepared by Sweeney Todd at this point. 

Is the restaurant built on a Native American cemetery? 

Suggestion: Raise the place and start completely over.

All joking aside I feel awful for our waitress.  She was polite and trying hard. 

To her credit she discounted our tab but nothing about this establishment is redeeming.  She needs to work in a place with more competent kitchen staff. 

STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"First time here. Late lunch on a Saturday. Ordered the Carnitas Burrito plate.  They nailed it!! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Where service lacks the food makes up. Reasonably priced. If only they had more servers (usually only 2 working the whole restaurant). I'd really love to see this restaurant succeed."}
{"text":"Went there last night (Friday) for the first time around 8:30, so a little later.  Pretty quiet in there for a what should be one of the busier nights for a restaurant.  The food itself was solid (tacos de carne asada).  Good flavor on the steak.  The plate was overwhelmed with the side items (refried and rice) and the three tacos were set off to the side instead of featured.  
My wife commented that her peach margarita was excellent.  On the other hand, she asked for water when she ordered the margarita and it never came, even as a manager asked us if there was anything else they could get for us.  
Their patio area is a nice place to sit out on a Carolina evening."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is really nice and clean with a big outdoor patio area. As for the food, the salsa was eh and so were the chips. The burrito supreme with rice and beans was fantastic with a large portion size even at lunch. My son loved the kids beef nachos. What kills this place is the terrible service. There was 1 family guy working for 5-6 tables and he was very short and never asked how things were the entire time. They first brought out the wrong plate for my son and 10min went by without him even saying a word or even an apology so we had no idea if they were correcting it or when to expect it to even come out. Don't be cheap and hire more servers because you obviously have the business to justify it."}
{"text":"Hungry for an amazing Mexican dinner, this is not the place. Our server was awful. He kept giving us excuses and at one point admitted forgetting our table. That should tell you enough!"}
{"text":"So this is my second time here and I'm sad to write a poor review, however the reason why I'm writing this instead of dining on delicious Mexican cuisine is that we literally haven't seen our waiter to tell him to bring us the check for this cheese dip in the 30 mins we've been sitting here. 

My first experience was average but today is crazy. I don't know if they're short staffed or what but there's 1 bartender, 1 bus boy, and 1 waiter. There's an elderly woman who brought us chips and salsa but THE waiter has been zooming all over the restaurant. After waiting so long we basically finished the chips the waiter brought us two waters with no ice and 15 mins later comes zooming over and exclaimed \"you know what you want yet?!\" 

Trying not to get annoyed we ordered the Fiesta Dip. 15 mins later he slides it onto the table and leaves before we can say a word! The dip is literally so watery it won't stay on the tortilla! Then he comes back at some point and asks if we're ready to order. As politely as I could I said \"it seems you're short staffed and unable to accommodate us so we'll just stay with the appetizer. He walks off without even acknowledging what I had just said. I thought that the cheese just needed to cool but no, it's basically water. So we wait...and wait...and wait...and wait. 

Finally he comes back and I asked for the check. I showed him the dip and he literally started trying to count the shrimp. I told him that I ate 1, which I did. He then proceeds to charge 1/2 price for it. Now we're not hard up for cash just so we're clear. But the principle is why I'm annoyed. He did not care that he'd given poor service. He didn't care when I told him I was writing this. This restaurant will not get another dime from me."}
{"text":"Showed up tonight with a group of 8 and we were turned away because they decided to close early. They had slow traffic. I'm sorry but closing your doors at 9pm when you are advertised till 11pm is a bit early. People eat later in the summer."}
{"text":"Food was good, need to work on service and the Owner is extremely  Rude.
Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the arroz con pollo and I'm pretty sure it wasn't just chicken but pork mixed in as well. I had my dining companion taste the dish and she agreed. I'm not into mystery meats so I'm solid hell no on the food here.

If you go maybe get something like shrimp. It's easier to identify."}
{"text":"While perusing through yelp, relentlessly as if I'm going to find a new restaurant in the area, I read the reviews about this place with high hopes to eat some great Mexican not too far from my home. To my surprise, contrary to past reviews I've read about this place,there were some positive reviews about the service and management change. Poor management is why I had avoided this place in the past. Being from the west coast, I consider myself a Mexican food cone suer and only having been in Charlotte for a few years. It been a real challenge finding authentic food that lives up to my expectations and has good service. To my surprise, I was politely greeted and seated near immediately following my arrival at the hostess podium. Now the food... AMAZING (to say the least). Salsa as a starter was fresh, robust, and flavorful, and certainly beats the tomato sauce based salsa that restaurants serve, the chips were warm. I was excited because if the salsa was any indication of the food I was about to be blessed. So maybe 10 mins after sitting and enjoying my chips and salsa, my plate arrived. I order combo #1 A, 2 enchiladas (1 beef, 1 chicken) and rice . EVERYTHING WAS flavorful, fresh, and deliciously seasoned....AMAZING . I'm kicking myself from not getting here sooner! The service was great also! DO NOT WAIT TO EAT HERE, you will regret it!  and no my reviews are never this long."}
{"text":"We heard this was under new ownership so decided to give it a try.  We were here last year and stopped going.   Today the food was good and the service was also good but once we got the check they added on 25% gratuity!!!!!    We had a party of 8.   I understand sometimes tip is added in but never 25%!!!   
We will not go back."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to try this place again after a horrible experience. We came in with low expectations, but were pleasantly surprised. The menu is full and the food was delicious and filling. Service started off great, but slowed down a bit. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The meat is iffy. Regardless of what you get. The service isn't necessarily slow, but it is strange that most of our servers had no knowledge of specials, ingredients or that mojitos are on special but they have no mint. (Lazy or out of mint are the same thing in the customers eyes). 

It does satisfy the \"need for Mexican food\" but don't shoot for flavor. Shoot for experience. The vibe is fun and colorful. A BIG selling point. The margaritas aren't too bad either!"}
{"text":"So after going there in the past I really did not want to ever go back...but then I heard there was new management and staff so I figured what the heck I'll give it another try. Went there and instead of waiting 15-20 mins for water and chips we were served immediately, dinner was good and service not bad either. Since then I have been back 3 times and the service is on point and fast, food is good and quick and the vibe is different, plus it's a good place to take the family or large groups! I definitely recommend this place now that it has new management/owners."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and everything was hot and fresh. Three waiters waited alternating and they were all attentive and courteous! Very nice lunch experience!"}
{"text":"Ok this may sound like a rambling but here we go
We just arrived home from the beach and needed to go to the grocery store
Instead as I was going thru the mail I read the article about giving La Fiesta Grande a second chance. We pull in and notice how nice it is on the patio. We sit down and enjoy our chips and salsa. As soon as our food is delivered it is like attack of the flies. Bees start swarming us. The waiter apologizes blaming the BP. We eat in a hurry while the busboy swats flies with a fly swatter. The waiter asks if we need to go boxes and I said no thank you, there were many flies on the food. Next thing I know, two managers come up to me and ask me whAt is wrong. I mention that I did not want to go boxes and they respond that we could of eaten inside awY from the flies. Next thing I know the managers friends  who are sitting behind me tell me I should have eaten inside that I am obviously not an outdoor person. The discussion continues and I end up in tears while wearing my be positive hat!!! Anyway I am posting to let you know that I do not recommend the Mexican restaurant next to the BP at Mountain Island. Please share with Mtn island neighbors. I really would not grant this any stars but with yelp you have to at least give one."}
{"text":"Ehhh, I don't know...I want this place to be great because it's nearby but *sigh* I read an ad for the Cinco de Mayo special $5 margarita. It only included the House margarita which wasn't bad, just wish I had other options. I ordered the Cancun shrimp, described as garlic butter shrimp with spices. It tasted like shrimp in marinara. I feel the description was misleading and I needed some pasta. Anyhow, hubs had the asada tacos, really good taste on the meat and it comes with onions and cilantro. Please do not ask for a side of cheese, sour cream or guacamole. A small side of gauc was $5.25 as it only comes in small or large and a plastic cup of shredded cheese was a $1. Maybe there is a fee for messing with the cooks original recipe. Service was good, more than one person stopped to check on us throughout but $50 for subpar food?!? I likely won't return."}
{"text":"Food is good owners are complete Mexican asshole. Double charged my credit card would not refund."}
{"text":"Went last night with some friends and the food was delicious. Had the Pollo en Crema...yum!! Such a cute little place! Great atmosphere, quick service. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"What a meal!!!! This was our first visit on a whim. I got a large peach margarita. The hubby got a large homemade sangria. Both were really good and worth the around $9 price (better then Chilis and 3 times the amount. 

They bring chips and salsa to the table and we ordered a small guacamole. The guacamole was HUGE for $3.99  and really good. We added some salt to make it pefection. 

Husband ordered the fajitas fiesta. $17.99 and he could not finish. I got the pollo alcapoco. Once again ate about half. 

We will be back no doubt."}
{"text":"We've been to La Fiesta Grande twice in the last two weeks.  Both times the food was good and the service was very reasonable.  I was hesitant to try this place based on some of the other reviews but our experience was very positive.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Much better under their new management!  The food and drinks were great and quite affordable.  Our waitress Hollin was super friendly and attentive!  We will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"The food is great. Service was wonderful.  Very delightful people!!! I love the selection of food available and it's very authentic... will be coming back and referring my friends.  Was worried after reading some of the old reviews but seems like the new ownership made a huge difference. Very very pleased."}
{"text":"How is this place even in business still? Honest question. 

The service is terrible. 

The manager is a real piece of work. Aka - blatantly arrogant and rude. 

A real torta doesn't consist pot roast and a toasted hamburger bun, it just doesn't. 

Heed my advice - 
If you're in the area and find yourself craving Mexican food, save your time, money, and frustration and go to Los Arcos down the street."}
{"text":"We stopped in last Sunday evening and sat outside on the patio. The food was delicious and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Came with my husband and 5 year old. We all loved it it's pretty inside has nice patio outside covered and uncovered and clean. Cheese dip was wonderful"}
{"text":"We didn't enjoy this restaurant very much. The food came out cold and a few things were missing or mixed up. It want even crowded so there was no excuse. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican place in the area. The food is excellent. The quesadillas and margaritas are my favorite."}
{"text":"I go out to eat lunch almost 5 days a week.  I think servers and restaurant workers have a tough job and i am normally a 20% tipper.  If i think the service is lacking, i might go down to 15% - 12%.  I like the food here, that is not why i am displeased...I walked in slightly early for lunch...11:15ish.  The manager(maybe owner) walks me to a table right next to the only other people eating in the restaurant, and the floor had just been mopped with a strong smelling cleaner.  I asked to sit somewhere else where the floor was not wet.  He tells me to sit where ever i like then \"explains\" to me that the floor is always wet early and if i want a dry floor i should have come in after 12:30.  Somehow I pissed him off with my request...Ok...whatever.  I find a seat in a dryer section and wait for my friend.  chips salsa, and a tea...nothing bad.  friend arrives, we order.  server is a different guy (I think maybe another manager/owner since he was dressed business casual) I ask for a torta but i don't want fries, i would like beans instead.  (FYI I have made this substitution about 5 times prior to this particular visit with no issues).  the server tells me no substitutions \"Only Fries\".  Then tells me beans will be extra.  I say, \"OK I still want beans\".  Walks away from me speaking in Spanish to the manager.  We wait.  Chips empty, never brought more.  Then our food comes out. Friend has everything, I have just a sandwich.  So i wait to see if the beans are coming out next.  Friend ends up asking if my beans were coming out soon.  The server said \"no, it's extra\".  He then becomes combative with us about how I said \"no\" to the beans.  back and forth for a while, so i say, don't worry about the beans the torta is enough.  He then starts speaking Spanish across the restaurant to the manager as he is standing at our table and walks away.  That is all we see from him.  No checking on the food or if we wanted anything else.  The manager who was annoyed earlier comes back with checks.  Now i tip on service...I was not about to tip this guy 20% for his \"work\" and being a gracious host.  I paid the check in cash and left the guy the change that was left from my bill.  You may disagree with that, but I was unhappy with the service and that is why people tip.  The amount i left was obviously unsatisfactory to the manager because he follows me out and tells me i need the money more than him and drops it on the ground in front of me.  He then tells me that he doesn't want me to come back in anymore.  

It's a shame because the options are limited on this part of town, and again, i like the food.  I wont be going back and if you want to support someone who cares about customer service, you shouldn't go to La Fiesta Grande."}
{"text":"Rude owners, horrible service, and bland cheap, over priced food. Did I mention rude owners? I will never frequent this poor excuse of a restaurant again."}
{"text":"We love this place. Ideal for date night on Friday night . They have live music and great service!!. We also found out they are under new management....finally!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte. They always remember my order and serve me quickly."}
{"text":"The service was a little weak but the salsa is amazing and spicy so beware if u don't like spicy! Food was really good! I would definitely recommend this place but don't come expecting to make friends as the wait staff wasn't friendly nor personable."}
{"text":"I've come here twice since the new management. The first time I came with my boy friend and I ordered the chicken quesadilla. Something pretty basic you would think. My boyfriend ordered a platter that had steak, shrimp and chicken with rice(I can't remember the name). My meal was not that great. I'm not a fan of shredded chicken there was water/liquid coming out of my quesadilla. However, my boy friends meal was delicious! Everything season to perfection, hot and it was a nice sized portion. 

The second time I came, I came only to socialize and drink. I ordered chicken wings(I know it's frowned upon, lol) and to drink I offered a margarita. The margaritas were delicious and the chicken wings were tasty as well. I liked that they had a band that night and the lady singing really included the crowd. It was not only entertaining but fun!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried out La Fiesta Grande last night for dinner, and we weren't disappointed!  We were greeted and seated immediately, and the service was very timely.  Our waitress was very nice and friendly.  We got a pitcher of margaritas, which were delicious--not too sweet/syrupy!  He got enchiladas and I got a taco--both were fresh and scrumptous.  I really appreciated being able to order just one taco (plus rice and beans), since most restaurants require you to get 3 or more per meal.  (NOTE: you can order three tacos as well!)

Basically: the food was fresh and tasty, the service was friendly and tasteful, the restaurant itself is clean and beautifully decorated.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My hubbie and I have been waiting for this restaurant to open and were very happy with our meal.  The chimichanga was perfectly cooked with shredded beef instead of groung beef.  My peach margarita was so delicious and refreshing.  Looking forward to going back and trying something new from their menu."}
{"text":"I found a rock in my food. It was the size of a pinto bean and was mixed in with the rice and beans. Thank goodness I did not break a tooth! I am very disappointed and no longer trust eating here."}
{"text":"I had a bit of an oddball request. I just wanted coffee. They were very accommodating. Brewed it fresh and were courteous and friendly.  I didn't try the food but the atmosphere was very cool and relaxed. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Delicioso!! Salsa had a nice kick, chorizo queso was yummy. The texas fajitas were perfect, very generous shrimp portion. We had carry out amd it was perfecto!"}
{"text":"The wife and I and my sister and her boyfriend had dinner here 9/11/15.
We started with drinks-Texas size margaritas for them, a peach margarita for the wife and I tried the homemade sangria. All drinks were good and the sangria was not to sweet as some can be.
For dinner my wife  ordered a veggie quesadilla and the rest of us got Tacos De Brisket which was shredded beef brisket with a great grilled flavor served in warm flour tortillas with pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and shredded lettuce for toppings. Its was also served with rice and beans, The rice was ok, the beans were bland and needed more seasoning.
Where this place lost points was the service. it seemed like we did not have a specific server, just who ever was walking by the table. We had to flag down some one several times and the busier they got, the slower the service got. We asked for take out boxes that never came, so my sister's boyfriend had to go get them.
Overall, the food and drinks were good albeit higher priced than other Mexican restaurants in the area. The service, at least on the night we visited, leaves a lot to be desired.
The food and drinks are worth a return visit, but at the higher prices if the service does not improve on the second visit, there will be no third."}
{"text":"Why would anyone continue to spend their hard earned money on this place.  The service is slooooow, and the staff walk around with frowns and they look miserable. 
I've heard the manager speak to his customers in such a rude way, I would have walked out.
I had friends go for dinner and one of the kids had a hair in their food...he said \" it's probably you hair \" and didn't offer to make another plate of food for her. 
I don't know how they are still in business."}
{"text":"No complaints! The food is superb and UNDER priced. The drinks are cheap and abundant. If variety overwhelms you,  look at the menu ahead of time as I did."}
{"text":"I can see service being an issue here. There was clearly just one waiter and a manager when we went on a Sunday at 5pm. They weren't super warm but they got the job done for us but I could see issues popping up as they get busier.  The food though is pretty darn good for the price.  I hate qualifying opinions but I am going to do it anyways.  I grew up and lived in cali for 30 years. Yes this place wont have the seafood dishes and lighter fare but for the heavier down home cooking its a-ok.  Margaritas aren't fancy but they are the classic ones I would get for cheap in the down home spots I would go to in Tustin or Santa Ana.  If you want fancy, trendy or light food this is not the spot. If you want good down home Mexican at a fair price with good enough service give it a shot."}
{"text":"This restaurant is horrible..3 times I've tried this awful place! If you actually get sat then pack your patience for chips and salsa much less a drink..the food is sub par. The service is slow and terrible..I will never waste my time with this place ever again!"}
{"text":"I had read the reviews for La Fiesta that were mostly good. Most of the 1 or 2 stars seemed to focus on slow service. I did not find this to be the case. Although a tad slow for drinks it was nothing to warrant a drop in rating especially with the quality of the food. Even the rice, which seems to have sat for the better part of the day at most Mexican restaurants was fresh. With mole not at many restaurants I quickly ordered the enchilada mole with chicken. Very good. The enchilada wasn't smothered in mole which is most always the case. My wife really liked her burrito as well. Very nice patio area where we enjoyed the warm eGood salsa. We'll be back.  

3rd time here and the service is still good and the food is very good!!!"}
