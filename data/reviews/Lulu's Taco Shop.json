{"text":"Not that great. The super nachos are not at all super. Way overpriced at $9. The service was not that great. They were inconvenienced when I asked for my order to be done a different way. One in our party enjoyed his meal. The other three of us were sad.   The bathrooms were lovely...."}
{"text":"The employee behind the counter taking orders was more interested in his phone than the guests in the restaurant. You pay a lot of money there for awful customer service."}
{"text":"We have gone to Lulu's twice now and have been happy with the food both times. I had the fajitas and shrimp tacos and they were very good.The folks working there were very nice and helpful.  A touch on the pricier side but, like others have stated that the food was fresh. Being a small business owner I understand what it takes to run a business and the cheapest is not always best, In fact it never is! Definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great food, I love their bean tostadas.  If LULU is there, the food is the BEST.  Look for her in the kitchen.  It's a family owned establishment and the food quality is amazing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I have been going here for at least 10 years, great food, family owned and run business."}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing - we ordered a second round of Carne Asada (marinated steak) and al pastor (marinated pork). So good. Better than Joyride and half the price. Ask for Lulu."}
{"text":"I had the best flautas and street tacos here. My wife had the shrimp fajitas that I got to try and I must say the quality was on point. I will certainly be coming back for more. Lulu the owner was very nice and introduced her self making sure we where satisfied making it an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Best tacos you will have in AZ. These are true Mexican style, open face tacos. Outstanding burritos as well.  This place is a dive. Keep that in mind befor you head out for some nice family dinner. Stop here for lunch."}
{"text":"Friendly, family owned, and delicious! Get the Gordo bfast burrito! Great for hangovers!"}
{"text":"Ok. Pretty good food for sure. But they destroy you with add on charges. $3 for a dab of guacamole (I just bought 9 avocados at Sprouts for $3). 75 cents to use a credit card. Small serving of rice and beans if you pay for them on the side.  My burrito with no rice, beans or sauce was $11.50. If youre okay with them over charging you, then come here. Food is good."}
{"text":"So delicious and super friendly staff. When they say hot salsa they aren't lying. It was so good. I highly recommend the AZ burrito. It is huge and great value for your buck. Their crane asada is the best I've had."}
{"text":"I ordered three separate tacos and my girlfriend ordered two small tacos herself. The Super tacos run almost $6 a taco and are big but not huge. The regular fish tacos are really small and are not fried to where they are very crispy. They happened to mess us on my super shrimp taco and gave me a regular shrimp taco. Normally, that isn't a big deal but because it costs about $3 more, I felt the need to address that. The Az super taco was great though, by far the best of the three I ordered. Although they do provide good food and pretty good service, the prices are comparable to Joyride just down the road. LuLu's also charges 75 cents to run a credit card for payment which is a little bit of insult already due to the high prices they charge. I see potential because of the pretty good food but maybe they should change a couple things regarding pricing. The big tv's for the menu's above the counter do look great too. Food- 4 stars. Prices- 2 stars."}
{"text":"Love the food at Lulu's. My wife and I have been eating here for years, and even stopped in while visiting family during the several years we lived outside Arizona. Glad to be back in town and enjoying Lulu's carne asada and burros regularly."}
{"text":"This was a total let down. First off, the girl taking orders was in a horrible mood and did not smile once. We ordered the carne asada chimi with the works. The carna asada was what ruined the dish.. Very tough- hard to chew- the chimi was mostly full of beans. The bill came out to 30 bucks so it was an expensive Mexican meal that was simply not worth the $. I liked my rice . Overall BASIC"}
{"text":"I went yesterday for the first time and loved it!! I had one fish taco and one shrimp taco. It was tasty and so fresh!! The fish and shrimp were good sizes. Not tiny small pieces. The staff were nice and friendly to myself and my one year old daughter. I can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Family night with wife and kids! A hiccup on my wife's order of a shrimp burrito. Lady at the front fixed order no problem. Solid food, the tortillas are definitely the highlight. Solid service and food will go back again!"}
{"text":"Been here so many times, the best food ever! Love the owners, truly amazing. Try the Pozole, the best ever. All of the food is awesome! Oh wait, beerita is so flavorful. Gotta try!"}
{"text":"So very disappointing.  Went to LuLu's several years ago and remember it was tasty; not sure what has happened since then.  First, the guy behind the counter was not friendly at all.  My party and I felt like we were imposing, even though it was 7 pm.  Second, the quantity and quality of most of their food does not warrant the hight cost...especially for street tacos.   Finally, when I cook rice and it comes out bad, I do not serve it.  I could tell just by looking at my plate that the rice had been sitting around most of the day.  Needless to say, we all almost broke out teeth on the rice.  My party had to stop at Filibertos to get additional tacos.  On the plus side, the Machaca was very tasty.."}
{"text":"The place was clean & the salsa bar was nice. My chicken quesadilla was very good, but my husband's enchiladas were bland & not very filling. He went back to order some tacos & they were the tiniest tacos we had every seen. Over all not a great experience."}
{"text":"This is my family's \"go to\" Mexican food place. I love the green chile pork and my wife finds the different shrimp plates delicious. Along with some good horchata, the food here can't be beat!  I've since bumped this up to 5 stars. We come here so often I'm working my way through the menu. The red chile burro is my new comfort food. Zopes are delicious and if you want something spicy, you can't go wrong with the AZ super taco."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff with excellent choices of food. Fish tacos are tick tick the bomb! You must try and you will come back. Don't forget your yelp 7% cash back offer and free chips and salsa n first visit."}
{"text":"Living near this place a long time ago and driving by I never stopped in.  After seeing more than positive reviews on Yelp here I decided to give it a try.  Here's one thing that bothers me about non-chain places: Train your staff to have a favorite!  Whenever I go to a place I've never been I always ask 'what do you recommend?' -- the default of 'everything is good' is NOT an answer people!!!  Be confident in what your best dish is and I'm ordering it unquestioned.  There HAS to be something that defines your restaurant...if there isn't, then you are just like a chain.  Given that (I didn't get a recommendation), I went with my trusty judge of Chorizo (burrito with egg and refried beans).  It was plenty portion and just came as the burrito.  It was good.  Not great, but good.   No free chips like others have said.  This didn't really bother me as I'm trying to eat better and knew I'd be stuffing my face with a giant tortilla, pork fat and beans likely cooked in lard (which is a good thing, btw).  The salsa was ok.  Definitely could improve here in my opinon.  I think El Ricos in Queen Creek has better salsa.  I  am agreeing with others on the price.  My *lunch* burrito was $8.99.  That's steep for a lunch single item.  Compared to Burrito Shack at nearly half that (and bigger burrito).  I don't think the taste -- which was good -- justified the cost.  My guess is that overhead is high in the complex.  I'd love it if there prices were lower -- if even for lunch specials.  Place was clean, ample seating and staff was friendly.  I will return and try other things (and bring friends).  They are also on Twitter: http://twitter.com/lulustacoshop which scores an extra point in my book...hopefully they will push out lunch discount deals via Twitter and that will bring me back sooner.  Good mexican, wish the price was just a bit lower.    Honestly I was going to rate 3 stars just now but really wanted 3.5.  I'm giving Lulus the benefit here and going with 4.  The food is good, prices could be better, but overall a good Mexican food experience and I will return...hopefully with a discount I got via Twitter (hint, hint)."}
{"text":"First and last visit to this restaurant the food was very uninspiring. my wife ordered soup which was bland and contained some undercooked hard potatoes. I ordered a carne asada torta and the meat was old and tasteless. The majority of the sandwich was stuffed with lettuce and a feeble attempt at guacamole. The price point at which this food enters  the market is extremely high for the quality that the consumer is receiving. I will not ever eat there again. also I would like to add that the owner was rude when confronted by the facts about her food quality. Do yourself a favor and find a better Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is their tortillas. I crave their bean and cheese burrito. I've tried a couple of other food items but didn't fall in love. It's reasonably priced and I love to support a family-owned business. I would recommend this for others to try."}
{"text":"Went a few Sunday's ago. The lady at the counter was rude as all can be. Seemed way overwhelmed with the phone orders and customers. Tacos were nothing to brag about. The Spanish rice was burnt and color was way off. Also there is a salsa bar there but you have to pay for the chips does not make sense to me. Will not be back after my awful experience."}
{"text":"We went to Lulu's a couple of days ago for the first time and we were blown away! The cashier was super helpful and nice. I ordered the carne Asada chimichanga and it was AMAZING! I would say that the carne Asada was the star of the dish. I have had a lot of carne Asada in my life but none of it compares to this one! The salsa bar was also on point and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This is THE place for authentic Guadalajaran Mexican food. No, I've never been to Guadalaraja, but they say it's from there, and the food is SO good, so I'm down with it. I absolutely love mom and pop joints, and this is the ultimate. I love the story behind the restaurant--they came here from Mexico and worked hard to save money for their own restaurant. Who doesn't want to support the American Dream in action? And the owners/founders are the ones cooking your food. Rock on! Everything I've tried has been delicious and flavorful. Spring for the super tacos--it's bigger, more meat, and there's cheese in between the tortillas. Worth it! I overheard them saying they were closing for remodeling this summer. Looking forward to seeing the finished product! We purchased the homemade flour tortillas to take home, and it's amazing how different (better) they are than the store bought ones. They puff up when you cook them, and they get crispy and delicious. This is comfort food, for sure. Stop in and try it, you won't be disappointed. Great value, too."}
{"text":"As a person of Latin descent, I am offended, nay, I am embarrassed to hear them touting this as an \"authentic Mexican\" food.  I have NEVER paid $6.00 for store bought chips and salsa.  Don't even get me started at the store bought taco shell!!!  The only thing authentic about this place is the music ... and frankly, I would have much rather listened to the sounds of me trying to eat my taco after it broke into a dozen pieces when I bit into it.  I think there is a reason this is rated so high by others ... they have never had \"authentic Mexican\" food before ... I'm going to my Nana's for chili verde now .. after I get some tums! This place is a never again visit .. save your money and go Taco Bell folks :)"}
{"text":"Great chorizo breakfast plate and really good ceviche. I wish I could eat here for every meal. I can't get enough of their food."}
{"text":"Lunched here today. We used a \"Living Social\" coupon, which obviously confused the lady who was running the register. As a result of her confusion, she charged my debit card for the whole amount, then had to refund it, then had to charge it again, and somehow came up with a different amount that I owed every time.   The second strike against this place was that it took 45 minutes from the time we ordered our four tacos until we actually received them.   Third strike, the food was below average in my opinion. I had the beef taco and the carnitas taco, both super greasy meat, with less than impressive flavors. The salsa was ok. My sister had the AZ super taco and the shrimp taco, her were better than mine, but still not fabulous.   Add those three strikes to the fact that they have a very cramped little parking lot and that pretty much left me knowing that I won't be heading back there anytime soon... or ever."}
{"text":"The lady at the cash register is so rude! Not only to the people who dine in but also to the costumers on the phone. My first and last time coming here. The food isn't even all that great and small portions for the price but the rude costumer service is what sucks the most."}
{"text":"This place is bad ass! I'm COMPLETELY addicted.  The carne asada tacos are one of the best I've found. Made to order and FRESH!  They're generous with the cilantro and onions which makes such a big difference.  I always get a side of deeelicious rice as well.  The AZ burrito is OMG SO GOOD!  I don't like potatoes so I substituted for rice and then it is seriously the best burrito in town!"}
{"text":"The food is legit but really- it's expensive!  The salsa is weak-sauce. Tapatio is spicier.  I asked the lady in the kitchen for a sprinkle of queso fresco on my carne asada tacos and she straight up had the audacity to say, \"It's an extra $2.50 for the cheese, is that okay?\" I said. NO thank you- I don't want $2.50 sprinkles of cheese.??!?!!?!? who charges that much for cheese? I could buy a damn block for that price. Their chicken soup is dope though!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here on the weekends for menudo for over 15 years it's always good. I've cheated and tried other places but always end up back at Lulu's :-)"}
{"text":"We love Lulu's and have been eating there for over 10 years. You order at the counter and seat yourself. The staff behind the counter can be hit or miss on how friendly they are and the atmosphere is nothing special, although certainly clean and an authentic feel.  But the food is fantastic!  We love the enchiladas and the street tacos. And their refried beans are so good!  Their food has a great authentic taste and is consistently good. It's one of our favorite Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"I did not try their food but I went in to get an ice tea. It was almost $3 and so old that I took half a sip and dumped it out. Nothing worse than terribly old ice tea!"}
{"text":"First visit. Came in for early dinner on a Wednesday night. There was NO courtesy AT ALL. Young guy took our order, while keeping looking at his phone, then started texting, without saying sorry or anything. No thank you, no smile, as if they're doing us a favor. As other patrons came, same behavior. Food was okay. We will never come here again."}
{"text":"If youre one of those people like me that is used to have good Mexican food like the one in all San Diego Ca, don't bother coming here.  Carne asada fries, the AZ burrito and Fajitas plate,  is what I ordered. I almost cried. Savorless, pricey, and the portions were so little, on top of that, they charge you .75 cents for using CC or debit card. I found the place through yelp. I believe this place is overrated. In the outside has a huge advertising that says that the place is rated #1 in all AZ.  Hard to believe, because my experience today was like having ramen maruchan at home"}
{"text":"First time coming and was not disappointed food is very authentic taste as good what my grandmother would make. Customer service is great. Prices are slightly higher but well worth it. I would suggest bigger cups on the aguas fresca or free refill."}
{"text":"LOVE Lulu's!  Once I get a hankering for some Lulu's I have to go.  My favorite is the cheese quesadilla on a flour tortilla, chips and salsa and a strawberry margarita.  My husband gets regular tacos, nothing fancy, but he loves them!  Great food and I always head home with leftovers.  The churros are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food you'll ever find. The fajitas are mucho bueno. El Inferno burrito is to die for. Don't forget to get dessert or to take a picture with the life-size cardboard \"most interesting man in the world.\" Prices are a bit higher than FiliB's, but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"If you think Filiberto's is good food, then you will like this place. Fish tacos were dry and as tasteless as the lukewarm beans and that fluffy rice thing.  I love Gilbert and want to support the mom and pop's but this is not good. How has this place been around so long is beyond me.  I've driven by it for years and figured it must be great so finally gave it a try.  Bummer."}
{"text":"We just got back from Mexico and let me tell you...this place is probably as close as you will get here in Gilbert. We got pastor tacos, a gordo burro and a couple beef tacos all of which were good. I usually do not order chicken at Mexican restaurants but since we had never been there before I decided to try it and boy was the chicken tasty! Guac was good, nothing that you would think came out of a tube with a neon green color, I am pretty sure they make it in house. Needless to say this place is darn good and would recommend it over Los or any bertos place around here."}
{"text":"I got delivery, only Mexican food in my area that delivers and I have no food in my house so I definitely ate everything, and they delivered quickly. However, I did ask for no cheese (even in caps) and they still put cheese on it. Also the portion sizes are a bit smaller than I thought they'd be.. Plus the fries were soggy and gross, and the beans were watered down. The main dish was fine (besides the cheese) but overall a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"So, my boyfriend and i had been there numerous times for takeout. Tonight we decided to eat there. Not only did we wait at least 3 min before someone took our order  ( 2 people saw us standing at the counte), but when she finally got to us, she wasnt pleasant at all. Like we were inconveniencing her. We also had to go pick up our lukewarm and bland food ourselves. And other patrons literally had their food brought to their tables. So disapponted. Not sure im going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love Lulu's! Everyday they make a set amount of flan and once it is gone you have to wait until the next day. It is my favorite! If you want authentic Mexican food made with LOVE, this is your place!"}
{"text":"We love this place! I've been going here for years. Lulu and her husband Israel and lovely people. The food is delicious, try the shrimp anything. The salsa to go will sour you on anything bought in a jar for life."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, friendly service and very clean. If you are looking for a quick delicious taco this is your place! It's also conveniently located in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"We always go non chain and love this local joint. The fish tacos, Shrimp quesadillas and burros are our favorites.  Lulu's caters also. It isn 't cheap but it is really good."}
{"text":"The hubbs and I went in one night while the kids were away. We live close by but hadn't tried it before so we thought we'd give it a shot.  I was surprised when we went inside, I thought it would be more....well, just more.  Oh well, some of the best places to eat are dives, right?    We ordered our food (pricier than you'd expect for what it is) and sat down to wait. When our food came we settled down to eat only to be told that we had to eat elsewhere, that the dining room closes at 8. When we got there we thought we had plenty of time because the door says they're open till 9.  A little put off, we packed up and headed to our car. The door was closed and locked after us and all the lights were turned out. Guess they were closing early that night (8:30).  Things didn't improve from there. We dug into our food as soon as we got home only to find that it wasn't very good. I had ordered a carne asada torta, which I had been craving, and the meat was dry and salty and the guacamole was only spread on the bread in a super thin layer like you would mayo. My hubby got tacos and by the second one I could see he had lost interest. According to them they were bland.   Overall, not a great experience. Next time I'll head to Rienda's. They've never let us down."}
{"text":"Food was decent, not too sure how this place is getting such rave reviews though...  Probably the most expensive Mexican place of it's style. $25 for a burro, two tostadas, and two mini-tacos. Seriously?! Also, no free refills or chips/salsa.  Are we going back? No."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem right off of gilbert road. To be honest I was a little skeptical but in comparison to any other Mexican food joint in the gilbert area, it blows all the other competition out of the water. What I look for in any quality taco spot is their lengua or tripas. Surprisingly not many people know how to work with such proteins. I got a number 8 combo meal which is a large size taco plate with rice and beans. One lengua and one carne asada. Both proteins were extremely tender and full of flavor, especially the lengua. There was no toughness of the meat whatsoever. Rice was fluffy, full of flavor, and the beans as well. They have a salsa bar in the restaurant ranging from mild-hot. I always go for the hot but individually each salsa was amazing. None of that watered down, weak, tomato and spice combo. You could truly taste every ingredient in those salsas. Such an underrated joint. Service is friendly and welcoming and food is extremely affordable. That lengua is so good, if you haven't tried beef tongue before I really recommend getting outside your comfort zone and doing so. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but the service is terrible. I have been here 2-3 times and have been waited on by 2 different people who both were cold and rude."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding, decor wonderfully boring, and the prices comparable to some 'sit down / server' restaurants for the most part because the FOOD IS SIMPLY LEGIT and HOMEMADE.   I'd put Lulu's food in the 'gourmet ethnic fast food' category - even if I did just make up the category.  Its a damn fine space to be in, whatever we call it.  Yeah, I'll pay an extra buck or two vs Rubio's (which I still like) or Baja Farce (which I don't) or the like because I'm willing to pay for a little cultural nuance and to  support a great local joint.  Oh, and for the homemade Mexican food..  People that hate on Lulu's are usually better off at 'stuff your own burrito' joints (which have their place, I begrudgingly admit) or a chain like Garcia's or On The Border.  Those types of mexichain restaurants, with their ketchupy salsas, melted nacho cheese, and properly folded napkins may be more to their liking .  Others may prefer Abuelo's for the ornate 'hacienda' decor (and macro mex), or Joyride for the extremely tasty drinks and hipster vibe.    Hey, I'm kind of something approaching a hipster, if not just a nerd with eclectic taste, so I love Joyride's music, decor, drinks and like a few things on their fun and overpriced menu.  But when I need a serious Mexigrubfest, I am going to get down and dirty @ Lulu's.  If you're a fan of real Mex / ethnic food, don't need some teenage server to kiss your ass or show you their piercings or pieces of flair, just go order the gdam fish burrito at Lulu's.  Or anything else.  It'll scream 'authentic' all up in your grill and you'll never leave unhappy.  When I wasn't mostly a pescatarian, I'd dig hard on the al pastor burro.  It is one of the more perfect 'man grab' offerings out there.  Lulu's bean burros with chewy tortillas slathered in red and / or green salsa (I alternate pours) are perhaps the best in town.  Lulu has been kind enough to make me 'custom' burritos like shrimp a la diabla with rice and guac stuffed in a giant tortilla (the diabla plate is great but I'm lazy) before, which I am grateful.  Dios mio, so good.  Tacos are great too - remember they are 'street tacos' so don't go order then go whining like a spoiled ignorant guero (like my mom did) about how small they are or that they aren't on cheesy flour tortillas that dampen a taco's flavor instead of complimenting it.  Lulu's base green and red chile salsas are simply perfect and you can easily go through 2-3 little containers per burrito if you are a sauce hound.  They're the Goldilocks 'just right' combination of spice and flavor.    Remember - always, always ask for extra salsa so you can save it to slather on your fried eggs the next morning."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in Arizona.  I love their menudo. My son loves their bean and cheese Burros and their tripas are d-licious!!"}
{"text":"My favorite type of food is Mexican of all types. LU Lu's comes in my top 3 favorite places to eat for burritos and tacos."}
{"text":"We called in our order at 8:15, they stop taking orders on Monday at 8:30. We were picking up pur order, two lg burritos,  2 street tacos, 2 sides of guacamole and chips.   They currenty were quite busy in the dining area and 10 ppl were behind us in line. The service was quick and friendly. Isereal the manager was awesome!  The food is great too!  I definitely recommend Lulu's!"}
{"text":"About as authentic as it gets. Great chicken tacos and that small hole in the wall feeling a lot of us like when looking for \"tru\" mexican food. I've been back several times. Never a fishy taste with their fish tacos, and service at the window is pretty quick if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I have, to date, not been able to find a better bean and cheese burro than Lulu's. I've been going here since I was a little girl and I swear that good 'ol burro get's better every time. I've also had their shredded beef tacos, chimis, enchiladas, and there chips and salsa are tasty. I've had their wonderful horchata and they have the best ice ever!! Is that weird...? If you go you'll know. It's like Sonic ice. It's run by a family and I see the same workers in there every time. I love getting to know them through the years, such a nice family. I do think the taco's are average, good, but average. But that burro... Bean's, cheese, x-tra cheese, and sour cream. Pour the salsa over the top and add some limes. Yummm!!!! I even moved to Los Angeles (mexican food?) and yeah right, I craved this place weekly. I love you Lulu's..."}
{"text":"Best beans and tortillas in the valley!  This family-run business has been my favorite for over 20 years!!!  I love the food!!!  Oh I almost forgot Lulu's empanadas---yummy in my tummy!  They come very close to my grandmas fried pies, which no one has been able to duplicate!"}
{"text":"This is a no-frills local place with great food at reasonable prices.  I always have the fish tacos and would give them five stars but the pina colada was disappointing."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. They honored a gift card that had been in my purse for years! The food was pretty good. We got their shredded beef tacos and a burrito. We will probably go again sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Where do I start?! This was our first visit here and definitely our last!  The girl at the register has a communication problem with people that don't speak Spanish so we weren't sure what we were going to end up with.  It wasn't just us, others in the restaurant were having the same problem and the owner came out from the kitchen and very loudly blamed the customers. While we were waiting for our food, my husband went to the restroom to wash his hands.  There was NO soap or running water. We finally received our food and tried it but couldn't finish it.  It was really bad!  For what they charge I would expect more food and definitely higher quality! I really don't understand where all these high ratings come from.  Don't waste your time or your money!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my husband and 2 young kids. The food was pretty good overall, but not the best Mexican I've had. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were delicious! Even my 2 year old wanted more of them. The beans and rice that came with the tacos was decent. I also had a chicken enchilada which was OK. The sauce was a little spicy to me and I'm not sure if the enchilada was homemade or previously frozen. The restaurant could use a little updating too to be more modern. It got kinda busy there as it was a Friday night and they only had a few staff working there - they could probably use 1 or 2 more people working during busy times to make the service faster. Overall a decent experience and I would go back for their shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. Where do I start...  First off I'll say that I'm pretty fair when it comes to eating out. I've lived around the globe and have eaten things that would make most people... well, you know.  But sometimes there are places that have strikes against them right from the get go. Such was the case with Lulu's Taco Shop.  The restaurant was well kept with the usual Mexican decor strewn about the walls.  Mariachi music filling the room. Tables, chairs yada, yada, yada. Nice place for a taco shop.  Now the strikes -  Strike One:   As another poster noted, 75 cent charge on all cards. ALL CARDS? Not a huge deal but a ding none-the-less. Fortunately I had some cash on me (which is unusual). Yes, I know the burden of paying that fee falls on the restaurant but that is made up in the cost of goods rendered is it not?  Strike Two:  My wife and I ordered the taco plates (two tacos, rice & beans). When asked if we would like chips and salsa with that I replied \"sure!\" To which the young lady behind the cash register said \"That'll be $4.00\" O.o??? Four bucks? For chips? They weren't even freshly made chips! Needless to say, after all was said and done, I got out of there $24.00 short of cash. For that I could have eaten at Arriba's and been served my food and have all you can eat chips, salsa and bean dip. At Lulu's you pay a high price and are still expected to get up and get your meal when they yell out your order. Just rubbed me the wrong way.  Not happy so far....  Strike Three:  Location. If it wasn't for the fact that one of the best restaurants in Gilbert is literally 50 feet to the south, it may not have been so bad but as I sat eating my (ahem) $4.00 little basket of store bought chips, I kept looking over at Flancer's wishing for a Chili Verde Birdie Turkey sandwich. That was almost unbearable.  One other little thing that I noticed was their beef is obviously grass-fed and not corn-fed. You get the distinct smell of hay or a stable as you chew your meat. Maybe it was just me but it was definitely there.  All in all, Lulu's is just okay. Not terrible food-wise but for what you pay, service could have been way better. Will I go back? Probably not. You'll find me 50 feet to the south.... ;-)  Cheers! Shawn"}
{"text":"I ordered a dozen tamales for Christmas a couple of days ahead of time and they did not have it ready. This was made worse by the fact that this was not for me but for the adopt-a-family program. The only thing the owner offered was for me to wait an hour or take my money back. She seemed annoyed that I was not happy with her options. Very, very disappointed with this restaurant"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure these beans are refried in lard--this makes my tummy happy, but not my waist. Good food, super friendly staff, and all day breakfast. Kind of dive-y and more of a lunch place. I wish the chips and salsa were free, but just a minor quibble."}
{"text":"I am a fan. This small taco shop that is family owned is just the right kind of place to go for lunch for some fast very good Mexican food. Don't go in thinking that its going to be a sit down place that will serve you. This is more like a indoor food truck. the food is fresh all the ingredients were fresh as well. No you don't get chips and salsa as you would expect from a food truck kind of place. The burritos are very tasty and large. If their burritos don't fill you up then you need to go to a buffet and just pig out. I will go back for sure and order the tacos (they street tacos so yes they are the small ones) they are soooooo good. And no they do not charge you to use the salsa bar, that is not true. i recommend that you try, you will like it."}
{"text":"Local Gilbert place that has been around a while. Really tasty fish tacos, but the side of rice and beans were not good at all. Family had ground beef tacos, which were good. Friendly service. Suggestion: Order a la carte items to try their full range of options."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place and it has been my \"go to\" for fish tacos (I just love their tacos!) BUT here is why only 3 stars (perhaps I should give it only 2).  I am going to find a NEW place for my fish taco fix.  The last 4 times I have gone there, the portions keep getting smaller & smaller and the last time I showed up at 8:30pm and they don't close until 9pm and already had everything closed up .. they made my tacos (small portion again) but wouldn't give me any limes, salsa, etc because they already put it away early.  It is so disappointing because I absolutely loved this place :-("}
{"text":"I've been going to Lulu's since I was probably 5 years old, my dad used to take me when all I cared about were bean burritos. 18 years later I can still say Lulu's is one of the best Mexican food places I've ever been.  I agree with a lot of what has already been said: chips and salsa are not free which is a total bust, some of the stuff is WAY overpriced, and... can we talk about the price of refills?? $0.79 no matter what size soda you bought? I definitely got screwed on that one by buying a small soda thinking I would get free refills...  It IS a hole in the wall. It's a great summer lunch place or an early dinner after a long day at the pool. Everything I've had: carne asada, bean burro, the salsa, they are all good. Just pricey. How did I pay $9 for a drink, a bean burrito, a street taco and some chips?? I will never know. Yelp is wrong, I feel like $10 and under should not be considered cheap per person, but that's what I have to put since all the entrees are about $10. But it was really, really good. I would rather pay like $7.50 but I don't eat there every day and I understand there must be some underlying cost we aren't aware of.  Oh, and they have CRUSHED ICE!! (The good kind like at Sonic) So I'm sold.  Thanks Lulu!"}
{"text":"Just one item is hard to judge by, but the Arizona burrito with carne asana was terrible. I even asked before ordering if the cane asada was lean or a little fatty. I was assured they trimmed their meat well.  I ended up spitting most of the meat out, and for $7, it had more potatoes than meat. Very disappointed. Sorry lulu to leave a bad review. Maybe I'll come back to try the tacos everyone raves about."}
{"text":"Always a good experience here. If you want good Mexican food, this is a place you can rely on. Sometimes you can even catch Lulu her self cooking the best, fresh, authentic food! Everybody is so wonderful and kind. I come from Los Angeles with Mexican food at my disposal and no where can compare to Lulus.   My boyfriend, my self, and coworkers come here so often they always recognize us. That itself is a wonderful feeling."}
{"text":"Because I live and work so close by, Lulu's has become my go-to place for Mexican food. It is reasonably priced and tasty. You order at the counter, and then they bring your food to your table. The service is quick. There is plenty of space, and the restaurant is open and clean. They also have a nice salsa bar and soft drink refills. In addition to common soft drinks, they also have Mexican-style drinks such as horchata. I particularly enjoy the rice that comes with their combo meals."}
{"text":"Menudo was the bomb.com!!! Best menudo I've had from any Mexican restaurant! This was my first time here and it won't be my last! It was pretty busy when we arrived for lunch and it got even busier once we sat down. The tacos al pastor are great and so is the agua de piña! Food and atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"Went to lulus tonight order is messed up and the ppl that worked there were rude and disrespectful we have here that we don't know who it belongs to nasty cold ...  I will not recommend an establishment that treats ppl rude swears at employees when customers are around ... first time there not impressed ..."}
{"text":"What an awesome dive - they focus on the food and do it well at LuLu's.  The food was incredibly fresh and flavorful. I had 3 chicken tacos, guacamole and lemonade. The pico was perfect, very fresh with just a little heat. My tacos were well seasoned, and overall the meal was incredibly satisfying.  I really love this place and plan to add it to our rotation for good local places to eat and or get take out."}
{"text":"First time I ate here, it was 5 stars.  Second time it was 3 stars since the carne asade in my tacos was overcooked .  So I am giving it 4 stars overall.  The rice and beans are excellent and for the money, this place is tough to beat for some quick tacos in a sit in setting."}
{"text":"Went to lulu's for lunch with a friend.the tacos are small, i like that.But tacos didn't have much flavor. Pico didn't have much flavor either. I had fish tacos ,not very much fish not a lot of flavor.  The salsa verde Was really good. I would try them again,  but was not a big fan this time."}
{"text":"The food was decent but a little pricey. We had the az burrito (a little spicy but lots of flavor), carne asada taco (pretty standard), and a fish taco (the texture wasnt what we expected....we prefer the fish tacos you get in rocky point so that might be why). Loved the chips and salsa but wish they were complimentary:) I have a hard time with places that charge for drink refills, so that's a thumbs down. Overall we might go back but this will not be a regular lunch stop for us."}
{"text":"This place was pretty disgusting, dirty, over priced, bad service, bad food yuck.  Got the two taco plate one ground beef and one chicken with beans and rice.  I dont know how they screwed up that ground beef to taste like it wasnt beef.  At least the chicken tasted like chicken but bland and nothing special.  Beans tasteless and of course rice same thing.  Looks like a family run business and nobody cares.  They are hiding in the back most of the time.  Friend walked up to get someones attention but crickets so I actually whistled really loud so my friend could get a beer to wash away the bad taste.  Will definitely never return."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other reviewers. The food is great, but seems a bit over priced. Combo plates range between 7-10 bucks! For a corner \"dive\" with no waiter service, that seems a bit much.   The burros are delish! Something about the quality of the large tortillas they use. For starters, they're authentic. Not big, white, overly floury ones like you buy in the grocery. Folks must love 'em b/c they sell them in a package! The salsa bar is stocked w/ 3 different house made salsas, pico de gallo, and jalapenos w/ marinated carrots and onions. Not all salsas are made alike! I love theirs!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First and last time. Just moved in down the road and was looking for a new regular place.  Ordered two Platter Meals and two beers totalling $35 only to then be told it would $2 more if we wanted chips. I feel like $12 for a platter should include chips.   They also charge a 75 cent fee if you want to use a card. I was under the impression that was illegal. I could be wrong. It's a rip off either way.  Apparently they run their kitchen better than they run the business. The food was decent overall however it fell short the price tag. Rice was bit bland and the beans were too thin.   The Shrimp Endiablados was actually pretty good. Salsa bar was average. Nothing to really stand out.  Staff was extremely polite and the storefront was clean but I left feeling like I had been taken advantage of. You got my two bucks for chips Lu Lu's, but you lost my business."}
{"text":"OMG!  I went to Lulu's today because I hadn't been there in 10 years (moved out of state- it used to be a daily stop) and I was extremely happy to see that they are still open and have actually expanded.  It is still the same great AMAZING, HANDMADE food and tortillas I remembered.  LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews for this place on Yelp I thought I would be in for a decent taco shop.  Unfortunately Lulu's did not stand up to the hype.  I had the fish tacos on the recommendation of the cashier - not great - I much prefer the fish tacos at Rumbi.  My husband had the beef tacos and the same thing -  very little flavor to the tacos - the one thing I did enjoy was the spicy chicken on my daughters quesadila.    If we go back I would only have/recommend the spicy chicken."}
{"text":"I generally don't revel in giving poor reviews. In doing so it is meant to be constructive.   We went today to LuLu's based on some of the Yelp reviews.   For three of us the total was 35.00.  Considering what we ordered I was taken a back by our final bill. Dish 1: two shredded beef street Tacos with cheese only Dish 2: two corn tacos with cheese Dish 3: two corn street tacos with side of beans and rice 3 drinks (smalls) Guacamole and chips Honestly I wasn't entirely sure my company was going to be full with two street tacos. Small portions and not much meat filling. I don't believe that we will be making another visit back."}
{"text":"When the pickiest eater of my bunch clears her plate, you know it's good!!! Tucked away in a little strip mall, this very clean and comfortable spot feels like home, especially when Lulu herself comes out to speak with you while the rest of the family keeps on eating. Try the zopes, AZ burrito  (if you can take the heat of the fire sauce) and have some flan too! We'll be back...and I won't be waiting 10 years to come again."}
{"text":"So delicious! We drove from Tempe to eat here. Today was my second visit and I tried the Az Super Taco, the street taco with carne asada, and the bean and cheese burrito. Amazingly good. Great chips and salsa too. The first time I ate here was right after trying out a disappointing taco place down the street. It cost twice as much and was half as good as Lulu's."}
{"text":"Okay, here we go.  My first under achiever review.  I hate to do it, but I must be honest.  Overall, the food wasn't EXACTLY bad, but it was very small.  For the price, I would have expected more on my plate.  It is priced just a tad more than the Rubios and Baja Freshes that it compares to.  The environment is a little bit cramped and (when i was there) the salsa bar was a mess.  Like I said, the food wasn't bad, but it definately wasn't outstanding.  With the prices and competition with the chains mentioned above, you would expect a LOT more.  I have visited this taco shop one time 2+ years ago and have never gone back (That says a lot).  Do yourself a favor and hit Rubios if you are in the mood for this type of food.  You'll save some coin and get tastier food (and more of it)."}
{"text":"I found LuLu's by way of a Living Social deal.  I thought the food was good and the pricing was okay. The counter girl was really helpful and kept her cool with a over zealous slightly rude customer. (wasn't me)  It isn't located near where I live, so I probably won't return except to use the second  half of my deal. Had the food been better than \"good\", I would go out of my way.  I don't agree with the extra fee to use a credit card..."}
{"text":"1st time trying Lulu's this morning for takeout and definitely wasn't disappointed. We ordered the green chilaquiles, pazole and chorizo burrito, all were great! This could be our new spot for breakfast before Sunday football!"}
{"text":"The only reason it's two stars just cuz the food is actually pretty good. I can't stand when restaurants do the extra charge if you want to use a credit card. It drives me crazy they also were not very nice about us wanting to use some gift certificates. Food is great but I wouldn't recommend the service"}
{"text":"Stop by Lu Lu's after finding it on Yelp, from the super friendly staff, very clean dining room to the awesome food a must do again experience"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday for carry out the guy at the counter looked high as a kite got the food home and it was to worst and I mean the worst Mexican food we have ever had threw it all out....Will never go back"}
{"text":"What a great place went to dinner with family and all our meals perfect. I had the Fish Taco and it was WOW the best. The prices are reasonable and the service made us feel at home. Thank you to the management for having a great staff. We will be back"}
{"text":"Cinco De Yum  I regularly visit Flanders in this same plaza, but I've never been to Lulus. Bario Queen disappointed me on my last visit, so we decided to try something new.    We ordered  from doordash app.  It was ridiculously fast and it was delicious.  This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Gilbert.   We had chips and salsa (perfection).  He had cheese enchiladas which disappeared before I could ask him how it was.  I got the chicken fajitas.  They were great.  Most of all ---- The churros are so amazing.  Order desert!  You'll be happy you did.    We will definitely be ordering or visiting again soon."}
{"text":"I stopped in the other night at around 8 o'clock and the place was dead with the exception of 1 lady. I then stood there looking like a moron for about 5 minutes while the little old lady behind the counter had a personal conversation with the only other customer in there. Once her conversation was over, she decided to stare at me until I started ordering, not using any basic customer service skills. I then order my nearly $8 burrito, and she starts speaking to me in Spanish. I obviously don't speak Spanish, and I know this lady knew basic enough English to communicate with me,  however she chose not to communicate with me in English. Once my food was ready, she handed it to me in a tiny little bag. I looked at the burrito, and it was barely bigger then the palm of my hand. That right there pissed me off due to the price of the food. If I'm paying nearly $8 for a burrito it should feel like it's more then just a snack. The burrito itself did taste pretty good, so that's the only reason why I'm giving 2 stars. The place is clean but way overpriced, and they have terrible customer service from what I saw."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with my wife since we saw a good review in the paper.  We were kind of disappointed.  I had the menudo--while a big bowl, it was not very flavorful.  And we also ordered three of the standard (small) tacos - fish, canitas, and carne asada.  Fish was very skimpy and not good.  The carnitas and carne asada tacos were also poor -- meat chopped into itsy-bitsy pieces and overcooked.  It was like eating bits of dried and flavorless cardboard.  We prefer the meals at the place on the Southern and Mesa Drive -- a Mexican bakery that also has good food."}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing I would crave. Reasonably priced. I had one of their egg breakfast with carnitas and found it enjoyable. My husband had the carne asada tacos and said the meat was too chewy. Found it odd to pay for chips n salsa when they have a salsa bar but whatev."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious breakfast burritos. Checked in on Yelp and got free chips and salsa! Score!"}
{"text":"Lulu's is a winner. Situated nearby a slew of much-praised restaurants, this mom and pop place lives up to its location. The staff is knowledgable and friendly, and the place is sparse but clean. The ingredients they use are always fresh, and the flour tortillas and guacamole are especially high quality. I would recommend both the cheese chile relleno and the veggie burrito; they definitely keep me coming back for more. I've also been told by many friends that the beef at Lulu's is prepared very well.   For Guadalajara fare in the valley, I don't think I'd go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This is a family favorite! We have been coming here for the past 15 years and it's our favorite place to bring people from out of town when they want an authentic dish. The new places popping up around downtown Gilbert, though trendy, can't hold a flame to this place. The food is delicious! Their Gordo Burritos are only $6 and they are HUGE. My teenage son loves them. It's a family owned establishment and that's hard to come by these days.  I absolutely love their homemade Horchata, no mixes here! There is a reason Lulu's has been around for almost 25 years, trust me, it's delicious."}
{"text":"REAL Mexican food- not your fast food, no choice, no flavor food. Typical menu and everything I wanted and more! Reasonably priced-I was a little put off at first that I had to pay for chips and salsa, but well worth it. My husband and I will def be back for dinner again- friendly staff, simply decorated and delicious food."}
{"text":"This was good mexican food.  I enjoyed the salsa bar (mostly the hot carrots!!)  It is nice to be able to have a beer also at a counter service restaurant.  I ordered the chili relleno plate.  It was good but I think I will try something different next time.  The tortillas were really good and I think I would go there again just to get tortillas to go.  Yum!  Oh and I am a fan of aqua fresca and they had a delicious cantaloupe one.  mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I eat here pretty consistently, at least a couple times a week.  It's right by the shop and they make the food quick.  Just order at the counter and skip having to deal with a waitress.  Family run and operated.  The basic stuff is great and some of the more special stuff like the shrimp plates are out of this world."}
{"text":"Best beans and rice I have ever had, and believe me I am picky about beans and rice.  Especially the beans, it is hard to find a place that has tasty, authentic beans that are not dried out.  Chips and salsa are highly recommended, I am an enchilada girl so I usually get that.  OH and those margaritas are excellent.  Nice and heavy on that pour :) The first two times we went in here the cashier was so friendly and helpful, after the third she knew us by name!! I feel like I am having dinner at a friends, a friend who can actually cook good mexican food!!"}
{"text":"For a taco shop, those were some pretty tasteless tacos!  I was so uninspired with what I was served that I did not even take a picture. My wife had fish tacos that were dry and also tasteless."}
{"text":"The place was clean and the food was okay...  There's Nothing too exciting or different about lulu's taco shop in comparison to other \"Mexican restaurants\" or \"taco shops\", the food was okay but way overpriced for what you get. They are a \"eat in\" restaurant but you can get \"take out\" there is no drive-through.   They have a salsa bar and i believe they also serve liquor since they have a shelf filled with it but it might be decorative.  I used the \"yelp check in\" for the free chips and salsa but it was not anything special but it's a nice offer if you enjoy chips and salsa  I ordered a AZ super taco which ended up coming out to $4.46  after tax... I mean almost $5 for a single taco is pretty much wow.. yeah not really down with that and again it was just another taco nothing special about it.  Sad that they don't have specials.  Oh and they also encourage cash payments so I guess it's better if you come in with cash.   Gave them a 3 star due to the ambience, cleanliness and friendly staff at the register. I made eye contact with the cook in the back and not even a grin or smile popped out.   It was Kinda disappointing.   I would ONLY recommend this place to people that are in the area and want to try a different place."}
{"text":"Order the AZ Super Taco. This is hands down the best taco in AZ and one of the best tacos ever made!!! Their burritos are stuffed with potato so better to just order the tacos. Their fish tacos & ceviche are also top notch. Awesome salsa bar, plenty cucumber, except carrots are too hard.   Service is hit and miss but they always serve a quality taco in a reasonable amount of time. Inside seating and restrooms were completely remodeled last year and it's no longer a dive. You could take 99% of girls there without squirming. The sinks inside the restrooms are super cool.  I would normally give this place four stars if it was in Cali or Texas, but because it's literally the only good taco shop in the East Valley (Phoenix area), I have no choice but to give it five stars."}
{"text":"OMG the prices!  First off, I'm a chimichanga freak. I always get the chimi (if available) at new mexican food places. We chimichanga lovers need to stick together, since there aren't many of us out there. I can tell you, as far as chimis go, you can find better elsewhere, and for cheaper, too. $9.25 for a chimi plate. Ouch!  Having grown up in Gilbert, it's amazing I haven't tried this place until now. At least I can say that I have. And that's about all I can say about it. As a first timer, I was a little lost and confused. Is it a sit down place? Do they bring me my food? When I asked for a water cup I got just that. A cup. I looked everywhere for a soda/water fountain (couldn't find one). Would have been nice to know that the water bucket/container/thingy was on the counter in front of me. Water tasted like the plastic container it was stored in. Yummy.  Another hefty deduction comes from having to pay $4 for chips and watery salsa. I couldn't believe the amount of \"nickel and dime\"ing going on at this place. It was unreal. Especially for the decor and quality of the place. I wasn't expecting much, and I certainly didn't get much in return, except a $17 tab for two. I thought this would have been eating on the cheap. I should have gone to Oregano's up the street, instead.  Won't be back, unless they start giving free chips and salsa, and knock a $1 off the chimichanga plate. For what it's worth, my wife enjoyed her mixed burrito."}
{"text":"I was sleeping on Lulu's for the longest time! This place gets 5 stars just on their Menudo alone. Seriously some of the best Menudo I've ever had. My brother told me about this place and after a night of debauchery, suggested we get to Lulu's STAT. I complied and dragged my 30-something-year-old body (that seriously cannot hang anymore, wah!) down to LuLu's.   The cashier that took our order; didn't even judge me with my oversized sunglasses (that I never took off) and sweatpants/homeless looking attire that I rolled up in. Got my Menudo, all the yummy fixings included. Cilantro, lime, salsa, salt, pepper, and a fresh flour tortillas made by Nana herself. Bam! Michelada to reinvigorate my senses, because it was ice cold and had kick. Double Bam!   I've ordered other things like the shrimp and chicken tacos, but Lulu's is seriously my spit JUST for the Menudo. Try it, you will be hooked. You don't even need to be hungover to experience it's magical powers and flavors."}
{"text":"A Gilbert staple. I personally love the asada breakfast burrito. Total goodness.  BUT.....after the last stop here, here's what I noticed.  ONE EMPLOYEE, she took my order and went back herself and made my burrito and this time it was tiny, not my usual plump fat burrito. Hmmmm......hope I caught it on an off day."}
{"text":"This place is definately a dive! Its small, run down, dated, and unclean. Ive been twice now, and both times were not by choice. Both times, my water glass had nasty stuff on the outside and inside. Very disgusting. Their tacos are puny, expensive and flavorless. Their guacamole just tasted weird almost like there was too much lime juice in it. Oh and those pictures that are posted on here are not accurate examples of what you get from LuLu's. Everything is tiny and doesnt have much color. This place does not impress me whatsoever and I about cry each time someone suggest that we go   :("}
{"text":"Very good neighborhood Mexican chow place.   We've never had anything bad here.  The owners are very nice and they are flexible when it comes to ordering to your liking.  I like their camaron ceviche and fish taco plate.  Hubby usually orders the carne asada burrito or chicken enchiladas.  My cutie pie likes the quesadilla.  We get so disappointed when Mexican places do not have horchata.  They have it here and it's good.  The portions are pretty good size, just enough for the price."}
{"text":"The beef stew & rice as a take-out was okay. What meat that there was was very tender; I found one chunk of potato and a few vegetables. A small container of Spanish rice & three tortillas were included. Only retried beans are available."}
{"text":"Wow, for a walk up Mexican place, this place is disgustingly overpriced.. I got a two shrimp taco combo meal, and it ran me 8 bucks and change.. They have a chip and salsa bar THAT THEY CHARGE YOU FOR.. They also charge for refills.. This place really nickle and dimes you.. The food was the tiniest portions ever too.. My shrimp tacos, albeit tasty, were in the really really tiny tortillas, I finished my whole meal in less than 5 minutes.. If you want a similarly good restaurant, go to Sorranos, prices are about the same and it's a sit down place, they also give you unlimited chips, salsa and bean dip"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican Food Ever, truly. We called in a order of pizole and taquitos and an order of nachos. What we got was an EXTREMELY small order(about 10-15 chips total) of \"nachos\"(just nacho cheese and jalapeños) it ended up being over $23, for just the 3 things. The Pizole was mediocre at best and the taquitos we were told came with guacamole, sour cream and cheese and lettuce. But in reality only had avocado, not Guacamole. No sour cream, no cheese and just a small slither of avocado at that for an order of 5 taquitos and a TON of lettuce. If either came with sides I could understand the price. However for the amount of food, and quality I would not recommend and I would go as far to say it was expensive for the quality and size."}
{"text":"Just left the place, used a Living Social Coupon, don't know what  you 4s and 5s are smoking, this best thing my Wife and I had tonight was the beer, and thank God they served them in iced glasses.  1st Strike - If you use a debit or CC they hit you with a .75 cent charge, OK so they don't want to have to pay the bank, but i would rather have a decent meal with the cost of the bank charge included than be hit at the counter with \"oh are you paying with debit or credit, that will be a .75 charge, OK\", like we had a choice since it didn't say anywhere on the menu or LS coupon about he up-charge. 2nd Strike - \"How about some nice chips and Salsa\", oh sure, since you hit me with a .75 charge on my card use, at least i get something to nibble on, OH they'll be $2.50, as noted on the menu, but you would at least think that you would get something authentic, these puppies were right out of some flavorless bag and then they hand you a \"small\" salsa bowl, to select from a \"salad bar\", 3 choices or 4 with the pickled carrots that looked like they had be in the bar since yesterday.  Salsa was very flavorful if you like slightly bad to real bad. 3rd Strike - We both ordered the Super Fish Taco and the counter person (CP), I call her that because that is where she works and there is no one else in the place, and that's where she stayed, except I think the cook in the back who dishes the food out of some nondescript container. CP was pleasant and suggested the \"grilled fish\" instead of the breaded because the grilled fish was, Mahi Mahi , if that was Mahi, I'm Capt Ahab and this was Moby Carp.  The fish tasted like something out of  a 3 day old hand cart from the back streets in Tijuana, and I'm sure that would have a better flavor. 4th Strike - \"Oh that's right you only get 3, oh what the &(*), here goes anyway, since we won't be back and I can't imagine how they survive.  The rice was not even eatable, the re-fried beans were slimy, and both were slightly, and i use this term carefully, warm.  I have had wonderful Guadalajara style food, it is great experience and this wasn't Guadalajara it was not even a good.  I wish they would put up a disclaimer that if you order this \"Special\", you'll be sorely disappointed.  It is a terrible evening when you have left a place and know that you have wasted your time, your money, and most assuredly, your taste buds!!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, so far the best thing ive had is there bean and cheese burrito. With places like los favoritos and Taquitos Jalisco that offer the same style and at times better food than lulus the prices are way too high here"}
{"text":"Delicious! I recommend checking this place out. Food is fresh!  very clean, and staff is friendly! Salsa bar is great option also  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Shredded beef enchilada and hard shell beef taco.  both we good and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, was not super impressed.    Used a yelp deal for breakfast, the lady who took our order then walked back and made the food.    Feel like I could have made the food better at my house.    Probably won't be coming back any time soon.    Obnoxiously playing spongebob on the tv extremely loud, even though there were no kids there."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight.  My son got the fish tacos. They arrived (delivery) cold and were honestly about the worse Fish tacos I have eaten. The fish isn't battered and there is no sauce of any kind on them. The fish tacos came with rice and beans which would have fit in at any workplace or hospital cafeteria. My wife described the rice as the worse rice shes ever eaten.  We also got a steak Chimichanga (which cost like 9.50!)  this was pretty good nothing to write home about but still decent.  I got a Gordo Burro it was pretty good but again nothing special. We also ordered the Medium chips and salsa which was 4.00 and the amount of salsa they give you for that is pretty tiny.   Also our food came with NO hot sauce.   I can't say anything was awful but I also can't see myself every eating here again."}
{"text":"One quick look into the kitchen and I see the owner cooking, I knew the food was going to be on point!  The AZ Super Taco had me saying \"this is so good\" after every bite!    My wife wanted to eat low carb and she was successful, she had Chicken Fajitas with salad, no beans or rice.. \"So good!\" ~ check out my photos"}
{"text":"Sad to say I won't be returning. I was looking forward to trying this place out. Ordered a carne asada burrito with guacamole. But that's pretty much what I got hardly any meat. It looked more like a rolled taco. I'm half Mexican but got the full white boy treatment. I would not have written this review if it wasn't for the poor attitude. I guess I have to go to the hood for real Mexican food."}
{"text":"I ordered the meat enchilada meal to go. Individual enchiladas were 2.99 the meal included 2 enchiladas and some refried beans with Spanish rice. It works out that I paid about 6.00 for two tablespoons of beans and rice with a small fountain drink. The enchiladas were pretty small too. I didn't feel the value. The quality of the food was less than mediocre. The other reviews said the bean and cheese burrito was the way to go, I should have listened."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have ever had in my life. Is it odd to say it is better than the food in Mexico? Take a trip to Lulu's and you will not be disappointed. Their beans are top notch and I love their shrimp plate. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego and we moved here about a year ago to Queen Creek. We don't have a lot of good Mexican food there. I work in Gilbert and went to this place for lunch!! OMG! I had 3 street tacos (chicken,pork and carne asada). They were the perfect flavor and delish!!!! Can't wait to get something else. Well done Lulu!"}
{"text":"Hola! Yo quero zopes en tacos  Yes, my Spanglish is tops!  Just like this place.  I would like to announce my new favorite hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint - Lulu's Taco Shop!  I ordered their Zope and el Pastor with rice and beans.  The zope base was different from what I'm used to.  It was actually a hard piece of bread instead of a hard shell tortilla, which wasn't bad at all.  The beef in each of the items I ordered was well braised and soft.  The salsa a top was okay but definitely needed some extra kick.  They have a salsa bar with some pickled carrots, onions, and peppers.  You don't see that around here in PHX often or at all!    The place is well decorated with some Mexican flair.  This is a real dive and what you would expect to have some great food and it did not disappoint!  They only accept cash so don't forget to stop by the bank. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I chose Lulu's for lunch today as my last full-calorie meal before starting my pre-Vegas vacation diet!  I love Lulu's for 3 reasons: freshness of the ingredients, value for my dollar, and swift friendly service.  They are great for picking up to bring back to the office, or you can eat in their clean little restaurant.  They are also very kid-friendly - my son devours the quesadillas.    Today I had a fish super taco & a carne asada super taco.  While I appreciate the healthy, grilled whitefish in my taco, I wish it had a little more spicy seasoning - some lime and tomatillo salsa made it much better.  The carne asada was also great with a little fresh lime and yummy pico de gallo.  The portions are very generous and I was stuffed with plenty left over.  Lulu - your fresh, plump taco will be sorely missed until September..."}
{"text":"** No free chips and salsa***  I ordered the Meat Enchilada Plate with chicken and it was very tasty.  However, I didn't really see any chicken.  If there was any in there, it was skimpy.  I paid $8.30 which I thought was a little too expensive.  I think I'd pay more like $6.75 for what I got.  This is a good place to go for a healthy lunch (compared to Carl's Jr.), but not dinner because the serving size was a little smaller than I'm used to.  There was only about 3 tablespoons of rice.  Sour cream is an extra .50.  I'm wimpy when it comes to spicy food and this food was just right, not too spicy.  There are no child's menu items, but they have for example a bean tostada for 2.55.  Over all, I'd eat there again if someone else was buying!"}
{"text":"Lulu's is AMAZING. The guacamole & chips are a MUST TRY! I also higly recommend a good ole' fashioned bean burrito, the tortilla is super soft * the beans are very authentic."}
{"text":"I love Lulu's! We have been coming here for the past 20 years, the owner (Lulu) is always here and extremely nice.  The food is consistently delicious, the place is spotless, and the service is quick.  We will continue to come here for our go-to Mexican food fix!"}
{"text":"Showed up at 830...all the salsas on the salsa bar were cleaned up...the guy was very very rude. And he acted like I was bothering  him  on his phone. He had to give me full limes because he already threw away all the limes and wouldn't cut new. The food was cold and packed all to go when some was for there.  Have another living  social deal but  don't even know if I want to use it."}
{"text":"This little unpretentious taco shop is worth the drive. Trust me. Lulu's set's herself apart from other similar restaurants with a tasty salsa bar, perfect homemade tortillas, and the Guadalajara-style, as opposed to the Sonoroa-style, Mexican food most places in the Phoenix area serve. You might want to try to avoid lunch hour as there is often a line out the door!"}
{"text":"Lulus Tacos are the best I have had in Gilbert.  Try the tripa [tripe], carne asada or the Arizona Super taco.  This is the closest you will get to the street tacos in Mexico when you are in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place another try some other day, because today was just not their day.  Several friends recommended this place as their favorite Mexican food restaurant in the Mesa/Gilbert area.  I know everyone has different tastes, so that may be part of the issue, but the other issue the day we went was that the carne asada just seemed a bit too charcoal flavored.  To give them another chance, I'll come back later.  The people were friendly and the place was clean.  Prices were pretty reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Lulu's isn't cheap. Now that I got that out of the way let me say that I love Lulu's chicken Enchiladas. LOVE. No, the tortillas are not homemade. No, there isn't anything else on the menu that is exceptional. Lulu's chicken enchiladas are graced by an amazingly delicious marinade and sauce unparalleled by other local eateries. Ask them to leave the onions off! I think it is a yellow mole. Not sure... plenty of canella, possibly some pumpkin in the sauce and sweet spicy goodness. My Lulu's chicken enchiladas addiction cost me some money over the years.  Que rico! Lulu's would get five stars from me if not for the slightly high prices."}
{"text":"Love the food here. The Gordo breakfast burritos are amazing. Nice people too.  Oh and the tortillas are so tasty.  They make them fresh every day."}
{"text":"We had a groupon to try the breakfast and overall we were impressed.  They gave good size, flavorful portions and the service was friendly.  The cook even came out to ask if we enjoyed our meal.   The restaurant itself was clean and well taken care of.  Next time I'm going to try the menudo or one of their seafood dishes.  Since they are serving breakfast, they may want to add coffee to the menu :)"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today after eyeing it for a while. While I love Mexican style food, I'm not much for the super lardy, fried stuff with chewy meat. I love a good fish taco, and I'm a big fan of SoCal and Joyride style tacos, to give you an idea of my preferences.  My husband and I went in for lunch, and it was busy but not packed. Decor was what I expected - simple, nothing exciting, but looked clean enough. We weren't sure what to order and spent a while looking at the menu behind the counter. A lady came out and asked us if we had questions (we later found out this was Lulu herself). We asked about the Zobe and she explained what it was, and recommended to get it with pork (chicharron, she told me). We did, with green chile sauce. It was delicious. I also got a veggie taco which was very tasty - small, but double corn tortillas. My husband got a chicken enchilada - that was alright, but nothing special - we wouldn't get it again. I had my first try of Horchata and it was good. Pricing seemed average for this style of place - maybe a little high for some of the sides but we didn't order them this time. We will definitely be back to try some other menu items. I want to try the breakfast burritos! Lulu herself was very friendly and patient with us! Love supporting a local place like this where the owners are so invested."}
{"text":"Finally an authentic taco shop in AZ!!! Reminds me of home sweet home (chicago). All the staples are there...2 corn tortillas, cabbage, red salsa, limes....they even have ground beef...A rarity in these parts. Couldn't be happier :D"}
{"text":"I HATE that they charge 75 cents to use a credit card and that they charge extra to get a flour tortilla on a taco.  I have had much better tacos for less money!  I will not return."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now, my kids love the crunchy tacos and I enjoyed them as well.  I decided to try the Pozole and was not disappointed, a little pricey, but very good.  The enchiladas were not my favorite, the enchilada sauce contained cinnamon and I have never been a fan of that.  The street tacos with ground beef and the Carne Asada were a tad pricey but again very good.  The fresh homemade Jamaica and Horchata were fantastic.  Here is my complaint, if your bill isn't at least $15.00 and you pay with plastic they charge you 80 extra cents. Not to sound like a cheapskate, but check out a new processor."}
{"text":"Food was OK! Got the shrimp tacos with beans & rice was about $9. Tacos were smaller than my hand! Rice & beans were gr8 but overall I wouldn't crave this too much!"}
{"text":"I just moved into town from CA and was eager to find my favorite neighborhood taco shop. There are several within walking distance. Lulu's is my first attempt. This ain't it.  I got a mix carne assada burrito with a side of rice & beans. The burrito was almost flat...almost nothing inside. The beans  in the to go carton were half filled. I'm still hungry and I got the friggin special! What little meat I did get tasted good enough but the portions were scarce. Very skimpy for the price. And I was the only one there so it wasn't because they were busy.... Now I know why no one else was there. I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Well the food was ok my wife and I wanted a good Mexican lunch I wasnt that hungry so I ordered 3 street tacos and a soda she got a burrito and a soda and the bill was $20.00 I was like wow these tacos must be huge well we received our food and the tacos were tiny her burro was a avg size I looked down and thought this is what $20 will get you here now mind you we didnt have any extras just what I had said   this will be last time here"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The service was great and the food came out fast. I didn't give it 5 stars though because the salsas were a little bland and my husband's super nachos were a little bland. I had the Gordo burro with chorizo and it was delicious! We would go back."}
{"text":"Like the sign says \"Best tacos in AZ\".  But to be honest it should be best bean and cheese burritos in AZ!  Lulu's bean cheese burritos are nothing like I've had before.  With the combination of the bean, cheese, and Lulu's homemade tortillas creates a heavenly combination that melts in your mouth.  Although the dinning room is quaint and not as fancy as the other taco places located south from here.  I believe that the food here totally makes up for it.  Also, the staff is very friendly, even the kitchen staff will greet you when you walk up to order.  All in all, my experience at Lulu's is always a good one. The food is always impeccable, and it keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This place says inexpensive but it really is. Got our order wrong twice,  beef was dry,  not many condiments to choose from."}
{"text":"Best place in town. Service is great and we like that we can sit down and enjoy our meal. We did not have to wait long for our food. Salsa was great and we really liked that they have home made flour tortillas.   We ordered AZ taco,Floutas,pastor tacos and fajitas.  Delicious,Authentic and great service."}
{"text":"The tacos were \"ok\" I wouldn't go back for what I paid. The horchata is delicious, they make it home made. Probably the best thing there.   I would definitely recommend other taco places before this one."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Lulu's since it first opened. Now I have to drive from Glendale to Gilbert for her addicting burritos. If you care about really good beans, rice, and fresh tortillas, than Lulu's in the best. I have a bean addiction, but other people in my family love her tacos and still will drive 45mins for them."}
{"text":"Today I ordered the same thing as last time but it tasted different and the cashier was not as friendly. I wanted to get chips and salsa with the yelp check in and she needed to verify I checked in. Oh please, have some common sense or don't give free offers. I'm not coming back. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I'll be bringing my winter visitors here for really good Mexican food. The shrimp burrito was wonderful. If you love cilantro it's fresh here! And plenty of it. It's a restaurant where you order and pick up your food at the counter. Cleanliness is important to me so I was happy to find Lulus was  just that."}
{"text":"It's about time I wrote a positive review for Lulu's Taco Shop, we've been eating here for years. It is a family favorite and a Gilbert staple.  The food is delicious! The tortillas are what make this dining experience unique: fresh, warm, and homemade.  You can't go wrong with ordering the AZ Burrito or even their simple Bean and Cheese Burrito.  Their food is always fresh and the environment is spotless.  And, the best part, you will actually meet the owners while you are dining in this mom-and-pop Mexican diner. Their salsa is absolutely amazing and my favorite is their Horchata--delicious.  This is by far one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time here the food is very flavorful. The staff is friendly. Nice and clean. Ordered asada and egg breakfast burro with potatoes and cheese. Lots of potatoes and egg. Very little asada meat. Will try their fish next time."}
{"text":"Horrible! Very expensive for NOTHING! Greasy gross food. Dirty restaurant. Yuck! Even the guy taking orders CLEARLY didn't want to be there. First he had to hang up from his personal call on his cell phone to take our order. Then our food sat in the window until I walked up and he quit texting and noticed it was sitting there. We all ended up with a stomach ache. We will never go back and would steer anyone clear of there!!"}
{"text":"my go to spot for Polzole. Very flavorful and layered with spices. Salsa bar is great and so is the escabeche. Lame this is they charge for chips and soda refills. For this they get knocked down to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! We ordered 2 cerviche    tostadas, carne asada taco, and a grilled and breaded fish taco. When we were being rung up we were told there would be a .75 cent charge to use our credit card. The cashier wasn't friendly and quite rude when we asked for help with the menu. When we asked for chips she said that would be an additional $2.00. When the chips came they were cold and gross. Our food came out in two separate orders and lacked flavor. There was hardly any meat on the tacos. When we left I asked for a refill on my Coke and the cashier told me it  would be another full soda charge. We were expected to bus our own table for this lack luster overpriced food. Sorry won't be going back!!"}
{"text":"Lulu's was recommended to me. I could not have been more disappointed in the food. I ordered two carne asada tacos. The shells were stale and I had to spit out two or three pieces of the carne asada because it was tough and fatty. The rice and refried beans were unremarkable. The restaurant was cute and clean and the gal who took my order very sweet, but the food was terrible. I would not go back."}
{"text":"pretty good all around grub. consistent food quality. been coming here 20 plus years. never disappointed. Posole is good, Shrimp tacos are always a hit. recently remodeled and very clean. open early for breakfast and till 9 for the late night quick tacos and a beer."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Nothing exciting in any way. The Spanish rice was mediocre and there were green beans in it? ? The refried beans were very runny. I ordered the chicken street tacos. Absolutely nothing special or impressive. The chicken was dry."}
{"text":"I came in to order and the guy at the counter looked at me and walked to the back never to be seen again. The lady that was cooking just starred at me the entire time without saying a word. I stood there for about 5 mins until I walked out.  Awful service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some good street tacos, simple and very tasty. Try the piña juice its delicious."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this is my fourth time attempting to eat decent Mexican food at this place. Each time the young women who waits on us has an attitude like she doesn't want to be there nor does she want to serve anybody and make them happy. Last time I looked at my receipt there was an automatic 18% gratuity attached to my order. Come to find out by using VCA coupons, they automatically attach the tax and I gratuity tip for them and the restaurant. I did have one decent meal there but on the return trip things got really bad , my wife and I went to the shop about quarter after eight and a small young child about eight years old was breaking down the salsa bar. I ask what time they close they said 9 o'clock. Food came out cold bland no effort no flavor. Salsa bar was gone so way to ask for salsa. I get that you and your lady took in order for us to go and I had another 18% gratuity onto it. I ask her if that was the coupons policy or the restaurants policy, she said it was there at the restaurant.You will not see me Grace those doorways again. Don't lean on your past accomplishments because Gilbert is growing and there are tons of other Mexican food places Who have better food and want you to have a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Tacos were okay, not a lot of flavor. Same with the Rice. Chips and salsa are good though."}
{"text":"Be warned- super tacos have shrunk, and the price is still high!  LuLu's historically has been the best place for tacos. The AZ Taco is incredible, but all of a sudden, with no warning the Taco has shrunk, and the price stayed high. LuLu's needs to go back to the bigger sized super tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Been going to Lulu's for over 20 years.  They have the finest chicken quesadilla anywhere... Hands down.  Although that's not my main dish, (it's my wife's) her leftovers end up being my midnight snack.  The marinated chicken is moist, tender and holds up well against the onslaught of traditional mexican cheese.   My dish... Their bean and cheese burritos. There's simply none better.  Over larded tortillas, homemade flavorful beans and a cheese that makes you feel loved.  Yes, it's a kid's choice, but unequaled anywhere and amazing enough to keep this foodie hooked for over 2 decades.   I've tried other parts of their menu, and although good, these two set Lulu's apart from anywhere else in the state.   The shrimp plates match any mariscos shop in town. The burritos are a significant step above a 'beto's, but in my opinion, not worth the premium.  The taco's, again - good but over priced.    Find your special plate here and you'll continue coming back. There are culinary gems hidden in the menu, so if you're not tickled with your first try, check it out again."}
{"text":"I first dined here about a year ago and was really disappointed in wasn't going to go back; however, my wife had a coupon from some coupon book and I went to go get some takeout to watch Sunday football. First of all, the service in this restaurant sucks. There's laid-back and then there is rude-they are rude. I finally get to the counter to order and the girl is drinking a soda and eating her breakfast on the cashier counter. She said to me, \"what do you want?\" And didn't even give me I contact. I probably should just walked out right then and known better, but I didn't. I ordered street tacos and they were an absolute joke. The worst of it was the Pasole which really was void of taste, however, the worst part or all the cartilage in bones that were in there. Now I understand that you need that in there for flavor when making Pasole because I make that soup frequently. When I pulled out the bones and the cartilage it amounted to about the size of a tennis ball. The flavor of it was really Bland and overall just not good. Good thing I found rather interesting was that they charge $.75 anytime that you make a non-cash transaction. That's just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great Pozole & Ceviche! Family owed and operated they put the love into their food!"}
{"text":"The inside is very nice, especially the bathroom. Also very clean. I always go for the bean and cheese burrito, but I went for the Arizona burrito. It's was DELICIOUS!! My sister and I always say, you can tell a good Mexican restaurant by the beans and the salsa and both were amazing! The salsa tasted like my moms."}
{"text":"YUM! Finally found a local authentic taco shop. Great salsa, yummy taco and the rice was out of site! Will be a new regular spot!"}
{"text":"they nickel and dime you. charge a higher fee than they are charged by the bank to use a credit card, so they are making money off that.   and if you try to use the \"free chips by checking in on yelp\" they charge you.   this crap pisses me off, no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"This place really ain't bad. Matter of fact, it's quite good. The tacos are a little on the small side, but they're definitely two solidly delicious bites. I wish that there was a bit more variety (buche, chicharron, or tripa) but they DO have lengua and cabeza, and they do what they do really well. Looks like they also have daily menudo, so I'ma have to see 'bout dat.  Do yourself a favor and pay a few cents for one of those roasted jalapeños. Throw a nice amount of salt on it, and savor it. Honestly, I'd say that was one of the highlights of the meal. Sounds weird until you try one, but once you do, you'll know what I mean. Their jalapenos are MEATY and delicious.  All in all, this is a solid little place, run by very friendly people. It's not a roach-coach, but the food can stand on it's own just as well."}
{"text":"Great great great tacos! I go to a restaurant for the food first.  As long as it is clean, and Lulu's is, then sitting in, what looks like a used McDonalds booth, doesn't bother me a bit.  Afterall, it's a taco shop! I like the fish tacos (the small ones) and I usually order 3 of them.  I like how they are made and it reminds me of what you can normally find in Mexico, not at these chain restaurants. The Ceviche tostada is really good too, but is difficult to eat, so don't wear your sunday best. Not in the mood for fish, then try the carne asada tacos or any other kind for that matter.  Lulu's is a great place and a break from the Americanized Mexican Food, we see everyday.  Enjoy it for what it is!"}
{"text":"I live walking distance from this place and after driving past this place else everyday, I decided to give it a try.  The food is mediocre. The portions are small. I paid $10 for two SMALL  street tacos and a small cup-ful of soup... Like what?   The guy at the register was a prick. Bad attitude. Obviously didn't want to be there. On his phone constantly. You don't have to kiss my ass but don't be a prick! Won't be returning here just for that.. it was awkward and unpleasant. I know how it is to work in the restaurant industry, I've worked as a waitress for years. Being rude to people for no reason is not an option..No matter what is going on with you personally..   Anyway, until management can figure out how to hire some solid employees and a better cook, I won't be back."}
{"text":"So after reading the reviews for Lulu's, and with the fact that it's literally right down the street from me, I decided to head over and take this place for a test drive since I had the day off.  Pretty unassuming from the outside, I walked in and noticed the salsa bar to the side of the counter. Good start, this meant I was definitely gonna have to order the chips and salsa. I talked to the woman behind the counter for a few to get an idea of what to expect with certain dishes, and I settled on three regular tacos so I could try a couple different kinds of meat. I ordered one chicken, one steak, and one shredded beef. Now, when I got them home I was a little bummed that they were on the small side, but each one was delicious in it's own way. The steak was perfect, much better than what you find at most places. The shredded beef had an amazing flavor, despite dripping a combination of spice and grease, and the chicken was fajita style chunks of pure white meat. Delicious! My only complaint was the salsa...I tried all three, but none of them were particularly stellar. The best of the three was the one labeled \"Salsa for chips\", but it was nothing to write home about. All of them were kind of just bland and average at best. Despite the minor salsa bummer, I will DEFINITELY be back here...now I know to rock the super tacos (a bit more expensive, but surely bigger), and load up on those and bypass the chips and salsa. Maybe give the rice a try for round two...either way, check out Lulu's, good food here!"}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time Tuesday evening. Ordered three \"super\" pastor tacos and a shrimp taco combo for $21.95 total. The salsa bar had a fresh variety of tasty looking sides but when I got my order to go the bag was very small and light. Took it home and was disappointed to see three small pastor tacos and only two shrimp in each of those tacos with a small portion of rice and beans. While the flavor of the tacos was good, the beans were runny and flavorless and the overall value just wasn't there compared to Sr. Taco or Salazar Bros where I would normally go."}
{"text":"Can you give zero. Called in a order for ten with rice beans and chips. Was looking forward to bringing some Mexican yummyness to the family. After taking my whole order for this meal  guy on phone said no you can't take it to go. WHAT?!  Thx for nothing"}
{"text":"First,  if you are looking to remodel your bathroom,  you should check our their restroom for inspiration.  Secondly,  the food is amazing. My husband used to eat here all the time and we've driven by it a bunch of times and finally tried it out this morning for breakfast burritos.  Let me just say,  wow!  So good.  Plus a salsa bar with the carrots and peppers.  Reasonably priced and good portions.  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I ordered Carne Asada torta and 3 tacos(cabeza, chicken, and pastor).  All was very good flavor.  The cost was $16, which is not bad for the amount of food, but they were a little light on the meat, I'm sure it's a good business model, but I would expect a lot of meat for the price.  I would recommend if you are looking for very flavorful Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, and dull. This clip-joint nickle-and-dimes you to death.  The food is of decent quality, but UHM HAY, WHERE THE FLAVA AT? The only stand-out meat I encountered at Lulu's was the Al Pastor, which was tasty, and sweet, but not nearly as spicy as I felt it could, or should be.  If it weren't for the decent Al Pastor, Lulu's would have received a 2 star review. The beans and rice were also bland and flavorless. Food was prepared well, but it's pretty hard to mess up tacos, especially if you're charging about 40% more than more exciting competitors. zzzzzz."}
{"text":"Service was polite and Helpful. Cute Silver and Black Decor and Very clean place. Salsa bar very fresh. Tacos delicious, got shrimp taco, Carne Asada taco with homemade chips and mild salsa. Very delicious and Enjoyed my visit very much. Also got pineapple empanada! Very tasty."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving some Mexican food (as always) and having been here before, my friend wanted to come back since she had a pretty good experience here. I just moved to the area and love the abundance of quality Mexican food so naturally, I wanted to try this place out also.   The place looks pretty unassuming and tucked away in its own corner. We came around dinner time, and we were pretty much the only customers there. After briefly looking at the menu, I decided to go with the gordo burrito. I love that they offer a good selection of types of meats here. I went with half lengua and half carne asada, which was a great decision as I haven't been able to get lengua at other places in the area. My only complaint about the burrito is there wasn't enough guacamole. I mean, is there ever such a thing as enough guacamole anyways? Not really. But the burrito was supposed to come with guac, and I felt like it was just slightly smeared with guac. Other than that, solid burrito with quality flavored meats and salsa! With so many other Mexican places around, I'm not sure if I'd come back just due to my eagerness to explore other options around."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid. Never in my life have I found a better bean and cheese burrito! Blessing and a curse since I no longer live in Gilbert.. but I do make the drive often!   Authentic Mexican food, can't beat it."}
{"text":"Been coming here almost monthly for years. Excellent beans and tortillas, daily specials, good burritos and good albondigas soup. Will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. First time in. They do offer free Chips & Salsa for your Yelp Check in. I ordered the #9 COMBO which was an enchilada & taco; rice and beans. Asked me if I wanted shredded beef, pork or Chicken on my taco, I went with Beef. Prepared fairly quickly & after I got my salsas at the salsa bar : my number was called out. You have to retrieve your own plate from the counter that comes on a tray. Took it to my table & noticed that the taco is a very small street taco ( much different from the picture & item number they post). It had shredded meat and shredded cabbage on it, would have liked to have at-least seen a lime wedge to accompany that! The enchilada was filled with cheese and onion with a mild creamy enchilada sauce on top. Rice had mixed veggies with green beans & corn in it. Very unusual! I only got the combo plate no drink & it was $8.95 not including tax. I felt it was a little pricey, but that's just me! Salsa Bar has about 4-5 different salsas- non to which had much \"kick\" in my opinion. The meal it self was a little disappointing. Small taco : no big deal. Rice with mix veggies not a fan & the enchilada the best thing about that was the Cotija Cheese crumbled on top. It wasn't a memorial enough taste or experience for me to say, I would go here again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. The tacos are good, athough nothing like Mexico , but good. The menudo is really good.. A little over priced but it was worth it. The serving looks small but very filling. The only thing I would complain about is the prices. Overall a good experience. Also, you can check in and get free chips and salsa"}
{"text":"Drove by a hundred times and saw the reviews here on Yelp and figured I'd give it a try.  Best I can compare it to would be a poor imitation of a Filaberto's.  Neither of us finished our food & not because we were served huge portions.  I won't be back but I guess I'm in the minority here."}
{"text":"One of the best food tasting experiences I've ever had! Everything is delicious and A+, clean place also! I'm definitely going back as much as possible"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best tacos, beans, rice and horchata. Love the new look of the restaurant. The staff could be a lil friendly or involved but they were young. Still love it!"}
{"text":"Just drove 15 minutes to watch the owner close half an hour early on a Friday night.  The owner said we could take it to go if we want but could not eat in the dining room. Horrible attitude.  Went across the parking lot and was welcomed warmly."}
{"text":"Unfriendly atmosphere.. kid on his phone the entire time.. flavorless pozole.. tortillas taste musty not desirable... this place needs to just close... horrible at best. Worst pozole ever."}
{"text":"good homemade mexican w/ unique flavor.  Lots of choices."}
{"text":"By far best burritos around... Beans are fantastic. Tacos are awesome, super tacos are great always enjoy the bean burritos or Carne asada tacos or shrimp tacos ... Well worth the stop."}
{"text":"First found this place through a Living Social deal. To be honest I didn't have expectations, however this restaurant was AMAZING! I purchased that first deal and was back twice throughout the month.   I had the shrimp tacos, very tasty and filling. I also had a strawberry margarita, not so much a fan. But hey you are there for the tacos and other food right!?  Definitely a must try if you are in the Gilbert area!"}
{"text":"WARNING! DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE! YOU WILL REGRET IT!! I'm giving this place 1 star because I can't give it 0 stars. This is the worst mexican food I have ever eaten or ordered. Not only did my order take 1.5 to almost 2 hrs to arrive, even though I live 2 miles from the restaurant, but it was terrible and freezing cold! we ordered super nachos, a burrito, and a few tacos. The saddest thing I have ever seen. I mean how hard is mexican food?#! Trust me, be warned and pick another restaurant."}
{"text":"A recipient of many awards and much praise, I'm not quite sure what took me so long to visit Lulu's. It's quaint and cute. There was Spanish music on the radio and a silent Syracuse- Notre Dame college hoops game on the flat screen in the corner. It was a nice setting for dinner.  We ordered beef, a lot of it. We got the taco platter- ground beef tacos accompanied with rice and beans and a carne asada burrito. I enjoyed it all and immensely. The tacos were moist and the shells were crisp. The flavor on the rice and beans was just as tasty too. The burrito, which I was only allowed to nibble, was also delish- pico de gio, guacamole, beans, cheese and lettuce accompanied the carne. It was piping hot and exuded freshness. The only negative was that it was a bit greasy.  It was a bit on the pricey side and there's a charge for drink refills-- a mere 70 cents, but knowing the way I can woof down a coke along with Mexican food had me a bit turned off. However, the man behind the counter waived the charge for us which was a pleasant surprise. He was friendly and the food was fast."}
{"text":"Very casual family owned restaurant. Friendly staff and good food. Nothing here had ever knocked my socks off but the food is consistently good.  The shrimp platters are my favorite. For about $10 you get a scrumptious plate of food. I particularly like the baked shrimp dish with melted cheeses and green sauce. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I hate most Mexican Food (not that anyone cares) but love this place. Very nice family runs it. Everything is fresh. Made to order. And the guy at the front counter is cool!"}
{"text":"Lulu's Taco Shop has the most authentic Mexican food in this area. I am originally from Yuma, AZ and their food is just as good, if not better. I always order a bean and cheese burrito and an AZ Super Taco, which is the best taco I've ever had. They have a very clean restaurant, friendly staff, and a salsa bar! I highly recommend going in for a meal if you're craving some good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from LU LU's and it is fantastic. It is a little hole in the wall with a mish mash of restaurant tables and booths. It is not the most aesthetically pleasing place but that's not what gets me to come back to a place.   Salsa bar is good. Three kinds, very fresh, carrots and jalapenos are all free. Yes chips cost money. The food is fantastic. They serve authentic Guadalajara style street tacos. Yup they are small and like a buck fifty each. They are wonderful. Very very tasty. The chicken, carnitas, and machaca are all fantastic. They have delicious burritos in delectable tortillas. The chicken, machaca, carne asada are all wonderful. The lengua is the BEST! Tacos and burritos!   If you are looking for a delicious place to eat good Mexican food on a day where you wandered out in shorts and flip flops.......go here. It is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a half dozen times. The Shrimp burrito is worth the trip. Service is so-so. Bean and cheese burrito is good to."}
{"text":"Best Tacos I've had in a long time! Order steak and shrimp... You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place totally exceeded my expectations in every way! I was craving tacos and told my boyfriend I also wanted some seafood so fish tacos It was and we found this place rating well with only one $ so we gave it a try and it was very very clean and the prices were great and the tacos and the burritos were to die for!! I loved the fish taco and the street taco and the salsa was very hot! I will definitely be back for a taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Had the fish taco combo. The tacos were great but small for the price you pay $7.99.  Not a place I will frequent due to the price."}
{"text":"The  special carne asada tacos are delicious! Definitely the best I've had...the grilled onions and cheese melt in your mouth!  It is a bit pricey for a place that is a \"hole in the wall\" - not at all a sight to look at--- but at least the food is good..."}
{"text":"I had the tripas and shrimp tacos. By far the best tacos I've ever had in my life. Everything is just so tasty and fresh. Love lulu's!!!"}
{"text":"Any good Mexican restaurant will get their rice, beans and tortillas right and Lulu's certainly does. The green chile is flavorful and it was nice having the option of the type of meat (pork, chicken, beef). If your looking for a small place to grab a bite then I certainly recommend Lulu's."}
{"text":"I give it a five star because it represents a true Sonoran taco shop in the heart of Gilbert, As, USA. Food was fresh, no thrill, quick service and food delivery.  Unlock salsa and chips on Yelp and save $2. Overall food is very tasty!"}
{"text":"FINALLY, Mexican food to rave about!  Those that read my reviews know I don't get too excited about Mexican food.  I feel most places do it the same, just \"ok\".  I never eat Mexican food and think, \"omg this is good\".... that, is, until now.  LuLu's totally does it for me.  It's a little, unsuspecting taco shop that has daily specials, Mexican drinks/deserts/specialties.  Their prices are not cheap, but not expensive either.  Tacos are $1.50, Red Chili plates are $8.99.  They make everything from scratch, and you can tell by the quality.  Their salsa bar is incredible and they do breakfast.  For those of you who do not eat wheat / gluten, they are knowledgeable about their ingredients and can make dishes such as Red/Green Chili plates without flour, just ask!  Awesome!"}
{"text":"We here for a work lunch and unfortunately probably won't come back. The prices for the food alone seemed to be a bit high for what you got. Then when I was rung up there seemed to be additional cost that couldn't be justified. I went over it with the lady who rung me up but she changed nothing. Oh well, an extra dollar after tax, I'm sure the food will be good. The food was just average. I got two small \"super\" tacos that were bland and didn't seem to have anything in it besides lettuce and chicken. The beans and rice were just ok. I will say that their ice tea was delicious. I won't be coming back, bummer."}
{"text":"I love the food at LuLu's and have never been disappointed.  Their tostadas are SO FRESH and the taste is so clean.  I crave them!  The place is just a little hole in the wall local place, but the food is great and the quality is excellent.  We found them by eating at Flancer's across the parking lot, where we also go often for their sandwiches. Love LuLu's tostadas and beans and rice!  Way better than Filiberto's!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. This is good solid Mexican food. You aren't going to get the glitz and glamour of other trendy restaurants in Gilbert, but if you want a low key casual place to eat, this is your place to go for Mexican food."}
{"text":"As a Los Angeles native, I know Mexican food. I know tacos.  We came late Sunday night after a long day of moving. An hour before closing, we were worried that we'd be getting the left overs that's been sitting out all day.   We both ordered 2 tacos each and rice and beans.   I had carne asada & el pastor tacos. The tacos were the perfect size!!! The rice and beans were fresh, and delicious.  So good, I can eat there everyday!!  The place was so cute, nothing fancy. Just a taco shop, it felt like home."}
{"text":"Friendly and knowledgable staff. Service was fast and food was better than most.   We were told about Lulus from a friend and we're hoping for good food. All of the meats were perfectly cooked. The fish tacos needed no sauce the fish was so well seasoned and prepared.   They have a quesadilla we have had only at home: corn tortilla quesadilla. We had the pork stuffed one. Meat was falling out, it was so stuffed.   We tried the AZ burro, one of the most popular and it was amazing fried. The soda even tasted better than a lot of local restaurants (water being the biggest factor).   As we were devouring the flan, which had just the right amount of burnt sugar taste, we noticed how clean the restaurant was. It was right after lunch and all the tables were clean and the floors being mopped as we were finishing."}
{"text":"I ate here a few days ago for lunch, I got a carne asada taco and a chili reillno. The meat in the taco was dry and had little flavor but the chili reillno was amazing! It had tons of flavor, I was really impressed with it."}
{"text":"The plates are all very tasty but my god, the servings are SO SMALL!   The first time I ordered two soft tacos with rice and beans. It was about $9. I finished my meal in about 3 minutes and was still hungry so I ordered two more tacos, finished them in about 2 minutes, and was still just barely full. So I concluded that I spent about $13 to eat Mexican food at a walk-up restaurant. The sides of rice and beans were about 4 spoonfulls total.  The second time I ordered a more substantial plate but still did not leave feeling full, or feeling like I got my money's worth. The food is good- definitely 4 stars but the price compared to the portion size and tastiness is definitely 2 stars.  I've never seen a walk-up Mexican restaurant cost so much money. I'd expect to pay that at a sit-down place and have leftovers."}
{"text":"First time I have been here. I am all about customer service and I was disappointed. The lady behind the counter acted as though I was bothering her while I ordered my food to go. My husband and I can't have cheese on basically anything. So I ordered a bean and cheese burrito for my son- he can have cheese and I ordered a taco combo and she asked \"what type of meat?!\" In a tone I give my husband when I am bothered... We'll excuse me... I didn't know there were options. Geez. Mind you I had my 10 month old daughter with me which might have been why that lady seemed bothered because my daughter was babbling while I was ordering. I ordered a fish taco and a drink. I waited and it didn't take long to get my food. So I went into the car strapped my daughter in and then realized she didn't give me my drink. I walked in again and waited for her to even acknowledge me and I told her I didn't get my drink. She even seemed bothered by that. Fish taco and carne asada tacos were smaller than expected. Food was ok... Not the best I have had. I would have given another star if the customer service was better."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!!! I love it there. The staff is so friendly and it is always a delight each time my family goes there."}
{"text":"Really surprising good Guadalajara food.  We had the special which was whole Tilapia fried with salad and fries. Could have left off the fries and provided chips, but the fish was excellent!  Also had a couple of shredded beet tacos, very tasty!  Give it a try. Small place, only 10 tables. But quick friendly service."}
