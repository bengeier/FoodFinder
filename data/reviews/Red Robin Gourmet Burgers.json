{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Waited for a half hour didn't get our appetizer, while everyone who was seated after us was served.  The server didn't even get our order until 15-20 mins of being seated. I get its a new restaurant but it shouldn't take that long for our appetizer to get to the table. The manager had to go to the kitchen and get our food that was probably just sitting there. Then when we got our food the waitress came over and said she forgot our onion rings. So upset with the dining experience. Food was alright but still didn't need to take over an hour to get everything to our table. Thought this was a burger place?"}
{"text":"The times I have been here I was impressed at the food and service in comparison to a Red Robin I had visited several years ago. We were seated quickly and taken care of by the wait staff.

I had the Prime Chophouse Burger and the Burnin' Love Burger on two separate occasions. My food came out hot, fresh, and cooked to my liking. The fries were all newly made. 

Because it is a chain, you know going in that you won't be gettin extravagant food, but for a burger & fries kind of meal there are a lot of choices, many of which are good."}
{"text":"We had to relocate my young granddaughter's family birthday party at the last minute late this afternoon.  We had a total of 19 people that Red Robin at The Happy Valley location had to accommodate at the last minute.  Every one was so nice and Jared and Ray our servers could not have been more pleasant or helpful.  They even sorted out separate bills for each group in our family. We will definitely be returning there for more family functions!!!!!!!
Thanks again

{"text":"I don't usually give 5 star reviews but I based this on the food, the service, and whether or not I would go back. It's been years since I visited a Red Robin. I went there a few weeks ago and I had a great hamburger and the service was great.  I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow.  People seated after us received their food prior to us.  Had to ask and wait for eating utensils.  Much different service than our previous other visits"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Red Robin's food. I like their sandwiches and bottomless fries. However, this location needs work in costumer service and management. I've been to this location twice. The first time, I went with someone during the late afternoon/early evening on a weekday. It was not very busy, but it took awhile for someone to take our orders. And then we waited about 15 minutes for our margaritas. We got our food and wanted to order more fries since there were probably only 8 fries on our plates, but our server was nowhere to be found. We later realized that he was both the bartender and the server. Not very practical or efficient. When he finally came to our table and we ordered more, he disappeared for a long while again to make drinks for the people at the bar. There were other servers, so I'm unsure why he was bartending AND waiting tables. Anyway, when he did bring out more fries, there were only 6 fries. Yeah, some \"bottomless\"... We ordered more, and after another round of waiting and waiting, another 6 fries came out. Other Red Robins have not been so stingy with their fries, especially if the server is going to disappear for long periods of time and not check on you.

We went again on a Saturday night, so we expected it to be busy. But to wait 45 minutes for two sandwiches is ridiculous. Also, we didn't have any silverware for my friend to eat his starter salad, and we rarely saw our server, so we had to wait about 10 minutes after the salad arrived to ask her for a fork. And when we later ordered more fries, our server was extremely rude, almost as if we were inconveniencing her. When I asked her for more, she just sighed and walked away. After a few minutes, she came back and said, \"I put the order in but it's going to take five minutes to cook. Are you SURE you still want them?\" It's strange that she didn't have time to check on us for refills on drinks, silverware, or ask how our food was, but she sure made time to stop at our table and suggest that we should cancel our second basket of fries because it needs to be cooked!

I've been to other Red Robin locations and they have been great. But I won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"Customer service SUCKS if you're black. Upon arrival we was seated right away, however no one said one word to us for 10 mins at that point we left. 2 other white couples that arrived after us order drinks and dinner. Definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great food great service.  You will always enjoy this place.  Try the whiskey river burger.  It's great."}
{"text":"Celebrating Jaila's first day of Pre-K....Not too busy and amazing service today!"}
{"text":"I took my 2 year old son here for lunch today. Ordered him a cheeseburger. When they brought his burger to our table, the cheese seemed to have been missing. I let the server know, she took his burger and said she'd get some cheese melted on it. Well, she brought his burger back with a thick, cold, unmelted slice of cheese on it. Did she really think this was acceptable? Apparently so, since she brought my bill shortly after. Mind you, I am also currently 36 weeks pregnant and super emotional right now. I wished I were able to pull it together to actually let her and the manager know about it. Unfortunately, I ended up giving my son my meal, paying my bill and going out to my car to cry! Needless to say, this place has lost a very loyal customer."}

{"text":"Burgers are great, wife got the clucks and fries. Noticed of late the burgers seemed to have gotten a touch smaller. This is disappointing because as their signature item it is what sets apart the chain from their competitors. Still delicious just want a bit more! The clucks and fries were decent sized for my wife and the kids were entertained by the decor. We will visit again"}
{"text":"Great food, service and friendly staff. Have went with a big party the last two times and were well taken care of! Sometimes with a big party service can get a little hectic and be unsatisfying but so far it's been great! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The Burgers are fine. It isn't the food why I gave it one star. Here is the reason. I had my two sons with me and my ones son's girl friend with. It was my son's birthday on a Wednesday wanted to stay close to home. Food came out fairly quick. So I finally get the bill and go for the little pay box on the table. OMG I found out I forget my phone the holder has credit card ETC... in it. My son offered his card. I said no I have my checkbook in my purse. I kept hitting the light for the waitress to come back. She was a no show after 20 minutes I left the check on the table and left. About an hour later I get a call from the manager She said \" You left a check\" yes I did. She said \"No Restaurant in Arizona takes checks. I said well I'm new around here so I'll just pay you with a credit card. She told me I had to come down to the restaurant and pay. I said you can't take it over the phone??? Her response was NO because you never know who is listening. I was like you have to be kidding, Im not coming back in tonight. She said well I'll have to call my GM. Seriously you shouldn't be the manager if you can't resolve this. Just ridiculous"}
{"text":"I love Red Robin and this is my favorite location. Everything is clean, the food is consistently delicious, and the staff is phenomenal. Nancy served us tonight and she was so cheerful despite our questions, substitutions, and special requests. At this location, my drinks stay full and my meal is always hot, fresh, and phenomenal. Yummmmmm."}
{"text":"Since the renovation of the restaurant it looks more appealing to the eye. It was nice how it's a family friendly restaurant & the customer service was awesome. I give this place three stars, because their food is mediocre. There is nothing special about the burgers. It's nice they have a variety of burgers to chose from, but when you bite into the burger it's not anything spectacular. Also I don't like how they have steak cut fries I'm more of a shoestring type of person."}
{"text":"Great service the burgers and sweet pats to fries were great fish a bit soggy chips great next time I will stick with burgers"}
{"text":"The 4 is for my last visit...my waitress was in a bad mood and let it show...my previous visit the waiter was jovial and up beat and the service was fantastic...the burgers have always been done  to perfection and the fries crisp almost over browned...will come back and will ask for waiter he gets a 5..."}
{"text":"I took a friend here for lunch. $13.79 for four chicken fingers and a less-than-stellar cup of not homemade mac n cheese. RR used to be one of my favorite places but their insanely high prices just made me remove them from my faves list. I had a $25 gift card. There is no reason a lunch for two should be more than $25, but it was. I attempted to complete their survey but it wouldn't work so I emailed corporate. I got a blanked email that they read all the surveys. If they had read my email they would've known the survey wasn't working. The staff is nice but needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Stay Away...We waited 1  1/2 hrs for our food. Terrible service. I asked to speak to manager. She was no help. She was so busy, doing nothing. I asked for a spoon and was told they were in the dishwasher. REALLY? It was 11:30 am. They just opened. Very poor management. There are too many other places to eat. 
Will never return..."}
{"text":"I go here with the wife and son on a fairly regular basis.  The wife always gets the bacon cheeseburger with steaks fries, sometimes with the lettuce wrap, sometimes with the gluten free bun.  It's never a bad meal, usually between good and really good.  I usually get the simply grilled chicken sandwich on the lettuce wrap, I vary my side between the steak fries, sweet potatoe fries, broccoli or the side salad.  The chicken is always cooked well, just lacks a little bit of flavor.  I think it's odd that I have to pay extra for certain sides while not others.
We'll go here again in the future."}
{"text":"This was the worst Red Robin dining experience I have had. We were sat in a section that had 4 dirty tables. By the end of the meal only one of the tables had been cleared. It was 10 minutes before Kenya, our server, acknowledged us. We requested fries to be brought out before our food but sadly the request went unmet. You couldn't say it was due to the server being busy because there were 3 servers working the section and only 5 tables occupied. Once the food arrived we requested additional steak fries seeing as how they never arrived before. They came once we finished our meal. Our drinks were never filled and she spilled my drink when she brought the first one. The food was decent but my burger was a mess. I couldn't even keep it in the bun due to all the sauce poured on it. There were 2 managers on duty but it was apparent, due to the condition of the restaurant, they had low standards so there was no point in discussing it. I love the Red Robin on Stapley! The Superstition Springs location should send the staff there for training!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is crap. They need to hire more waiters. I don't think I'll be coming back to this red robin."}
{"text":"This review is for the Scottsdale Red Robin, at Pima & Shea.  

Very disappointing visit.  On a Sunday afternoon and I wanted to take my son to lunch while we watched some football.  I had seen the commercials about their gourmet burgers, and decided to give them a try.  While looking for a booth to sit in, we noticed that several televisions were not working and were unable to find a place to watch football, not a big deal.  We finally found a booth and sat down.  A member of the staff come over and told us that we were not able to sit in that particular booth, because it was too close to the bar!  I couldn't believe it, it wasn't even close to the bar.  It was about 20 feet from the bar, I thought they were kidding.  She said we had to move to the only available table which was in a corner, next to the bathroom without a view of any television.  I kept asking about other tables and booths, she kept telling me that they were too close to the bar area.  I asked if we could sit outside, or was that too close to the bar, but she said that no tables were outside.  I have never in my 50 years experienced a less desirable atmosphere to experience a meal.  Unfortunately I will never get to experience the food at Red Robin.  Not a friendly family environment at all."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money going to this filthy slow paced forgetful restaurant that's overpriced not one of the things ordered was done right the drinks came out wrong the pizza was forgotten the fries were cold the table was sticky and the restaurant was dirty this service was slow and they forgot everything."}
{"text":"The manager is great but the servers suck we waited and people that walk in after us their order was taken and food served I had to complain to get service will not be returning to this location food great service bad."}
{"text":"I went to red robin last night and had a classic bacon cheese burger , was not the best tasting in the world but I figured it's a chain restaurant what more should I expect . It kinda tasted like a wopper from Burger King . Long story short with n ten min I felt so sick my tummy was on fire I barley made it home to the bath room I will never go back again n life !!!!!!! Worse ever"}
{"text":"The burgers and steak fries very good, and the crispy chicken burger is also very good non beef choice. The Towering onion rings are shareable and worth a try."}
{"text":"Don't order a shake. it's more like a wendy's ice cream than a shake. A straw will not work."}
{"text":"Be sure when you order your food. If you order soup or salad as a side and you would like it before your main meal.  The bartender was new took him awhile to make a sangria   The waitress had an attitude.  The mgt did apology the staff was new....etc etc etc.  Not sure we will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"When it comes to burgers, red Robin gourmet burgers is one of the leading spots in Tempe Arizona. We dined at the W. Elliot Rd. location. Our hamburgers came as ordered, served with the hottest most delicious steak fries. They are quick to bring more fries if needed and keep your ice cold drinks coming as well! The place is clean, nice and cool, and the Service is spectacular!"}
{"text":"\"Gourmet burger\" is an oxymoron.  Put truffles on in, put caviar on it, it still is a hamburger,  Maybe there was a day when putting A.1. Peppercorm spread or chipotle aioli on a hamburger was enough to get attention, but today you can get an Angus Mushroom and Swiss burger at McDonald's.

Don't get  me wrong, I love a good hamburger as much as the next red-blooded American,   But on my first and last trip to a Red Robin, I found the \"gourmet burger\" pitch off-putting.  I made the mistake of ordering the Bleu Ribbon.  I mean, I love bleu cheese (they even spelled it right!) on a burger.  This, however, was overwhelmed with the steak sauce and chipotle aioli (no, the two do not go well together, in case you wondered).  In hindsight I wish I had ordered something that would have let me know whether they can properly prepare a hamburger.

I enjoyed Bad Daddy's Burger Bar much better, and think their menu is much more creative.

Red Robin is an attractive place, and our server was good."}
{"text":"A good experience. The food was good - hot, fresh bottomless fries, moist chicken breast, and tasty Smoke & Pepper burger. What stood out, however, was the service. The food was delivered surprisingly quickly, our server was friendly and attentive, and the manager was walking around interacting with guests. If you're in the area and wanting burgers, it's worth the visit."}
{"text":"I came in with my Husband today and had nothing but exceptional service. There was a small issue with our order but the managers came over to explain the issue, apologize and even provided a discount for any inconvenience (we were impressed with the level of service when we weren't expecting or knowing what had happened). We will be back to this location. Thank you, Red Robin!"}
{"text":"I ate here a year ago and would have given it a 2 star. This time its 3 stars....not 4 and heres why....patties are pre-frozen for sure (gourmet, yeah right). And I asked for the patty to be a tiny bit pink...it was rare! And like last time, the meat was completely unseasoned! Their flavored teas were good, and the endless fries were filling. My husband and I ended up having digestive issues for nearly 24 hours after eating there however. The environment is family-friendly, bright, and clean! The staff are helpful, kept up on the refills well enough."}
{"text":"Been there 2 occasion and got sick both times.  Burgers were raw in the middle. Have not been there lately....some of my friends love it,  not me."}
{"text":"The food took a really long time even though the restaurant wasn't busy. But, it tasted really good, especially the second time when I got food poisoning from it and threw it up all night. Food so nice I tasted it twice. (Incase you're wondering I had a garden burger and fries.)"}
{"text":"This place is so poorly mismanaged. Waited an hour and 15 mins until we finally left. Had every excuse in the book. The simple fact is they need to train their people better and the manager needs to manage. Done with this location."}
{"text":"We sat down and promptly left before we ordered. The back and bottom of the booth seats were filthy and the wall next to the booth had food stuck to it that had been there awhile.They need to clean up before we dine there again."}
{"text":"Started off promising....we had a big party (8 adults and 3 small children). Took our drink orders and was able to get that done. Was going around and taking food order, but one person in our party wasn't ready and she said she would come back to her. She finished taking the rest of our orders and then forgot to take hers. Someone had to go and tell her that she had forgotten. People make mistakes so that was understandable. Then our food came out after about 35+ minutes. Not cool when you have three little kids. Our food came out fine and my son needed a refill, the server actually noticed it and asked if she could get him another and I said yes. 5 minutes later he still didn't have his drink and he was asking for it. We had asked for ranch and pickles when we ordered and they were not brought out with the food either. Two people in the party had soup/salad and had finished their salad completely before they had to remind the server about the soup. Then when they reminded her she came back with one soup and said sorry they have to make more. So she waited another 10 min for her soup which came out so hot she couldn't even eat it right away anyway. The rest of us were finished eating by then. She made a mistake with one person's bill ( which was the same person she forgot to come back for her order) which made her have to wait even longer...again."}
{"text":"I won't be back! Not sure what all I sat on since they can't wipe off the chairs before the next guest. Took two full hours from the time we sat down until we left, because our server was very incompetent of waiting tables. They messed up the food, still I will say it was good, however due to cleanliness and wait time I won't be back. Even after the table behind us complained the manager still was no where to be found and not watching our table or his server!"}
{"text":"Got a craving for a burger, and found a coupon in the mail for Red Robin, so I decided to give the place a shot on a Friday night.  At 7:45 p.m., there was a long line of people out the door - no way am I *waiting* for Red Robin, we'll have to try another time.  Went back again on a Sunday at 5 p.m.  No wait at all, though the place was on the busier side for this time on a Sunday night.  The waiter was fine - got the orders right, brought timely refills on the drinks.  He hustled, but acted too busy to actually be friendly; I don't think the place was *that* busy.  The burgers were flavorful as were the unlimited steak fries.  Dinner was inexpensive, especially with that coupon ($28 total, including tip.)  Will definitely come again when I want another burger."}
{"text":"Good food ! Jesus is an excellent waiter and he is on top of his game. We did not need to ask for anything"}
{"text":"Oh man what is there to complain about.....nothing!!!!! My girlfriend and I have never had bad service here. There are some servers who are average but for the most part they are all great! The server that really keeps us coming back is Andrew. I give this guy a A+ he is so polite and cool has heck. We decided to go grab a bite to eat after work and our first choice was to see if Red Robin was open still since it was late already. We arrived about an hour before closing and normally around that time you get the rude servers who want to leave. Andrew promptly greeted is walking in through the doors and politely asked where we wanted to sit not only did he seat us but he was our server as well. We were not rushed at all to leave even though closing time was shortly coming up. The food is always great and it never disappoints us and for the service! Hire some one like Andrew every time and business will be even better! Thanks Andre for giving us a great experience."}
{"text":"I'd almost forgotten how much I dislike this place until my wife & I went there the other day since I wanted a good burger & she wanted a good salad. We were immediately reminded of of why we will never go there again. 

Too bad I can't upload the pictures I took of my UNCOOKED bacon, or my wooden fries, or extra greasy bun, or her wilty salad. Good thing the lazy chef bunched up all the bacon on one side or else I would probably have been sick.

Poor service everytime. Always disappointed with the food & it's low quality. Oh, & ALWAYS loud screaming children & babies. Red Robins burgers are the antithesis of gourmet."}
{"text":"Poor service, order was wrong ate half meal before found waitress to fix meal! Wasted 35$! Chicken was hard to cut with a knife!"}
{"text":"Appalling lack of quality and care. Not sure how you serve brown broccoli, old lettuce...sad that corporate doesn't care that a chain restaurant in an upscale neighborhood leaves such a bad taste for their brand."}
{"text":"Had the cibatta bacon burger with 7 french fries (endless fries) that was good. The only problem was the service walking thru the door. I felt like I had to greet the girl in the front or it would have been an awkward silence and say a table for two please while the other girls were talking at the same time. The wait time was about 15 mins and then when we were seated, the restaurant looked 3/4 full. 
I will go back again for the food, but I will not return if the customer service does not improve.

* words of advice* Make sure the person in front has a great big smile who will greet you like a customer and actually enjoys her job."}
{"text":"As good as it wss in 69 in Seattle. Very pleasantly surpried. Ordered the cheese burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were so good I ate them without catsup. The short srack onion rings were best ever and the burger was thick juicy and done right. The provolone on top was melted into the burger like it should be. Service was outstanding. This is a burger place, not a chicken place, so order burgers. Kind of like ordering American in a Chinese place, not a good idea."}
{"text":"This is a nice local place for us.  

I was very impressed with their server  staff that didn't refer back to the main server.  Most places would just say, I'll let your server know, but here it didn't matter if it was their table or not, they were quick to take care of us.

Great visit! Thanks"}
{"text":"Met with some friends here.  Our server was Jake.  Seated quickly and service was great.  Beer was cold (which is important to me).  

Most importantly we had a blast sitting there talking and didn't feel rushed to get up and leave.  Very nice for a Saturday eve."}
{"text":"just got a to go order, and it was by far the worst to go I have gotten from the location. big red robin person, but this was a very unpleasant experience. wanted a mushroom burger, bbq burger, and cheeseburger. for whatever reason I got my mushrooms on the side and no extra order of fries I asked for. also burnt burgers when we wanted pink. fries are still semi frozen and burnt burgers cold. no bbq on burgers, also left on hold for 3 some minutes NOT HAPPY and may consider looking for another red robin"}
{"text":"We went there last night for my husband's birthday. We've been to this location before, and each time we've had a pleasant experience. Our waitress was very quaint--not entirely personable, but honestly, I don't need a best friend to help me eat my food.

We had a good time, and the food was delish! I love how clean the establishment is too. This is a definite place for date nights!"}
{"text":"This was the first visit and the last tp red robin .  You can not get hamburgers cooked like you want.,  mine was a relegios burger, they cooked the hell out of it.  I wanted it medium rare and it was at least well don.  The fries have to be frozen,  They aren not at all crispy, are soggey and have the consistency of a wet noodle.  I would not recommend this place to anyone and my family and i will never go back.  It is not just me but the whole family did not like it.  The burger meal was about $9.95 with fries and service was terrible.  Not worth spending your money or waisting your time in a place like Tom L."}
{"text":"Besides a long wait to get seated when there was plenty of seats food was terrible and very overly priced.  I don't get how they can call it gourmet To pay $14 for frozen fish shrimp scallops was just terrible. will never come back again."}
{"text":"\"As good as it gets\" for a chain family restaurant. I give it 5 stars because for what it is, it does it well. Food is good, service is very good. I eat here several times a month and have never had a bad experience. Servers are always attentive every time I've been there. It does get busy at times but I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"So me and the girl went to red Robin. I haven't been for years and neither has she. I remember this place probably being a solid 2 maybe a 3 star but wow have they stepped up there game. Patrick was our server and he spent about 5 mind just solidly explaining the burgers and drinks we were looking at so we waited about 7 mind for our meals and the manager came out with the server to talk to us about our choices I was definitely surprised. When we bite into the burgers I felt like I wasn't even in red Robin more like an excellent high end restaurant after all I give solid 5 out of 5 and definitely a ask for patrick the guy is amazing and knows how to pair a beer for a burger"}
{"text":"Well for my Birthday I decided to go for a drive and see if the Red Robin was less busy further out. And granted it wasn't that busy however the bussers were slow on cleaning the tables so that others could be seated. Now I was told by my friend went to use the ladies restroom and there was no toilet paper and was a mess. And that includes the bar area . Now the manager from Colorado who was on at the time of my visit was nice enough to apologize for the inconvenience and was very understanding with my question asked. I do recommend eating at this location as well."}
{"text":"Not impressed, burgers are not at all like they are pictured in the menu. Place was dirty. Will not go back.  To expensive for what they give you."}
{"text":"Today me and my boyfriend decided to get a bite here and we experienced excellent service from the manager and waiter. I was given a dirty glass by mistake  (keep in mind it's 630 on a Sunday... it's busy!) I asked to speak with the manager, he came promptly and addressed the situation very politely and with care. He actually brought us new glasses and serviced us the rest of our visit. Food was hot and delicious, and he frequently came to check on us. Mistakes happen in any restaurant, but good customer service isn't always easy to come across. However, this is not the case here and I am likely to return."}
{"text":"At this location a waitress named Kristin was very rude. My teammates and I were talking to each other about how we did not get our freckled lemonades in the special cup. She proceeded to walk up to our table and said with attitude, \"Are you sad you didn't get it in a special cup?\" I believe this attitude she gave us was disrespectful and should be addressed.

But I give the waiter Shannon 10 stars he had amazing service and was very kind"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after a spring training game. There was no wait and we were seated very quickly. Server brought drinks and took our orders quickly. We waited a little while than we would have liked for refills and fries for the table but nothing enough to complain more about. The burgers we ordered were very tasty and were cooked the way we had asked. It was a nice atmosphere for a weekend lunch after a ballgame, I would definitely return here again."}
{"text":"I've liked Red Robin for years and have been coming to this location for the past four. They underwent a remodel recently and I think it looked better before, but that's beside the point. 

The burgers are still yummy, the service is still good and that freckled lemonade still makes my day. I'll put three of those away and not get tired of them. If you ask me, part of the fun is trying to scoop out the strawberries with your straw. 

The one thing I wish they hadn't done was put the steak fries in these small metal holders so they're all standing up instead of having a little mountain of them nestled next to your burger. In an attempt to \"fancy it up\" your burgers now come with fewer fries but don't let that stop you from ordering a second round. They are bottomless after all."}
{"text":"Not impressed.... I had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries and peach tea. Over all I didn't want to finish my food. The burger was sloppy and the fries were very salty. Not easy to eat. My tea just wasn't good and I'm a tea lover soooooo yea....
Service was great and the venue seemed clean."}
{"text":"Our service was awesome and this would have been a 5 star rating, but the up keep of the restaurant is terrible. The floors are super dirty from messy customers, and the restrooms are disgusting. The restroom area reaks of sewer. All the toilet paper rolls are lying around because they no longer have the crossbars. The trash bins were all full and paper towels and toilet paper littered the floor. The sewer smell has been there since my last visit about 3 weeks ago, so there must be no urgency to solve this issue."}
{"text":"Please, please do not dine here. 

Service is soo slow. 
I was with a party of 5 people. It took 10 min for the server to order drinks. 25 min for an appetizer and 40 minutes to get to the main entree. We didn't bother with desert. 

Food was so disappointing. Sorry I didn't take photos of the food. I had the BLTA turkey croissant sandwich. Bread was dry, 1 thin piece of turkey and the texture of the bacon seemed like it was microwaved. Did I forget to mention the amount of mayonnaise that was put on both sides of the bread?! No exaggeration, about a 1/4 cup! 
I had a side of broccoli that was flimsy 
over-cooked and slightly browned.
I had a side of fruit that was browned and dry. 
Seemed like my food came from a run down gas station deli.

My refill glass of strawberry lemonade had previously dried strawberry seeds on the rim!

The manager was called over. We explained our experience. He came to our table dragging his feet. He didn't care to hear a word and was quick to say we will deduct the meals and sides from the bill. By the way, the manager admitted to the broccoli being microwaved.

I'm not going to mention the disaster of the other entrees. 

Just terrible. I will not recommend or dine at this Red Robin again."}
{"text":"Staff is always wonderful BUT the new electronic \"servers\" on the table are the worst thing to happen ever. It charged us for the table next to us, nearly double our bill. We alerted the human server so the bill could be corrected. Turns out it takes 7-10 business days to remove the charge from a debit card. So we paid $45 for our neighbors bill, then had to pay $25 for our bill. Extremely frustrating!! Get rid of those stupid things and bring back human servers!! Also, I'm less inclined to tip when a computer system is the primary method of communication."}
{"text":"This is the sort of place you can take a group including meat-eaters, vegetarians and picky children and have them all find something they like on the menu. I prefer their blue ribbon burger (with a Gardenburger) to pretty much any veggie burger I've had in Pittsburgh. I am personally not a fan of steak fries, so I always get a salad instead. 

Negatives: It is loud in here (although that's not always a negative if you have kids). There's always a wait unless you go at a really wacky time. And they have one of those godawful claw machines."}
{"text":"The food has gone from bad to worse the burger meat is gray in color which makes me wonder what it is. My last visit was raw hamburger and the manager called it a bit too pink. My family has been going to this Red Robin for over 20 years. Seems to me this is a problem everywhere charge more for less and I am willing to pay for a good product elsewhere."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've gone here after going horseback riding at Rolling Hills Ranch with a group of my friends. We always go here after riding because we go riding with empty bellies and KNOW we'll be full by the time we leave here. We get seated quickly and waiting wouldn't be a problem with the multiple televisions they have, including the one on the floor! The ambiance and decoration in this restaurant makes you feel like your at home and can see the history and originality of the place. I've tried three burgers, the Whiskey BBQ Burger, the Bacon Burger, and the Cheeseburger. I have ALWAYS had a little pink inside and they had an absolutely incredible taste! The bottomless fries are great, especially with their special seasoning mix right there on the table. I think their new metal container for them is very clever. The waitresses or waiters that we've gotten are usually very nice and friendly, and give us a great attitude and are patient when we are ordering. Though it does take some time for the food to come out, we always get drinks within a short period of time which gives us awhile for some light conversation around the table. I don't mind the food wait, I actually enjoy it. It gives you and your company more time to converse and find creative things to do while waiting. Lovely place to be, absolutely incredible food and great service. Will gladly come back, any day, any time, no matter how busy. This place is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This location deserves 5 stars for the service alone! The food is good also, you will never find better fries ANYWHERE else! :) Back to the service...if you want to have the best Red Robin experience ever, ask to sit in DENIECE'S section.  She is the friendliest waitress we have ever come across - really outgoing, funny and personable - she will go out of her way to make sure all of your requests are met.  After our first time having her as our waitress, we came back, sat in her section and she remembered all of our special requests from the time before! The last time we were there, we requested to sit in her section and we were informed that she was getting ready to serve a group of 24 people.  She found out that we were there and insisted that we be sat in her section and by the time we got to our table, she already had our drinks, a hot basket of fries and our special \"cold\" buzz sauce waiting for us!  Tonight, we were on the Strip and decided to go to a popular \"burger bar\" at Mandalay Bay.  We had the worst service ever, the bartender acted like we were bothering her and she was so unfriendly.  Weird enough, I think that her attitude affected the way we felt about the food there...we paid over $40 for 2 burgers and 2 sodas and left feeling ripped off.  A restaurant can have the best food around, but it is the SERVICE that makes us keep coming back to Red Robin.  :)"}
{"text":"Very terrible service, waitress did not khow what she was doing. Did not state her name, walked by us twice with out asking if we needed anything. Someone else brought our food, we had to get up ourselves to get napkins. Someone by the name of Justin apologized, who was he? Then someone else came up by the name of Joey{who was he???} and said drinks are on us, unfortunately both burgers have been taken off for our Birthday's. Really un-proffesional. they could have put them back on our card's. The worst Birthday burger ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Come here often and love the Bonzai Burger. Usually get Diane in the bar as our server which is always great, attentive and welcoming."}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter after a show and we ate outside enjoying the cool evening breeze along with great food.  Our waiter was fabulous and very attentive without being in our space."}
{"text":"WORST LOCATION EVER we have given this place more than enough opportunities an Everytime they FAIL ! 
Horrible service horrible management 
They forget half of our good every time 

Last time we were there the manager tried to apologize for forgetting our youngest child's pizza by offering us free desert 
Well , he forgot to bring that as well 
Tonight we thought 
One last ditch effort 
... Their dumpster  was so overloaded and filthy the smell alone kept us from going inside ! It smelled like a a foul sewage leak"}
{"text":"Service is always horrible. A female server was training a new guy and she was very rude. Still tipped her good regardless of her rudeness. Food is always well prepared and tasty but the service could be much better."}
{"text":"Awful service. Cold food. Flat drinks. Not one good thing came from this experience.  I would rather eat gas station sushi than eat here again."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here before going to a movie with my fiance. Was halfway through my 2nd and last beer. The bleach blonde waitress (only gave a description so others can avoid her) went to take a plate off the table and spilled half a 22 oz beer all over my clothes. Pants, shirt, and jacket all covered. Then then says \"I guess thats your que to go\" as if it was my fault.  Then asked if I would like a replacement beer. I said that would at least be nice. She comes back with a beer 1/4 filled and walks away without another word. Nothing offered to compensate the fact that I was covered in alcohol that she spilled on me, except for her giving me less beer than what she spilled in the first place.  I have been here at least twice a month for 6 years. I'll never go back. I wish she didnt ruin this restaurant for me. But that was the worse customer service I've ever experienced. If that's how they are trained. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Horrible service tonight. Over 50 minutes and no entrees. Also only received one of our two apps that we ordered through the manager. No napkins, no silverware. I don't blame the server, she must have had 20 tables. Poor management. Going to take a break from them for a while until they sort out their issues."}
{"text":"I like the decor, spent awhile just peering around at all the cool stuff on the wall and ceiling. Have always loved their burgers, and the bottomless fries with the multitudes of dipping sauces are simply awesome! I recently went for my birthday and had an amazing server! It was incredibly busy and loud but he was still timely and checked up often, we never had to try and get his attention. I don't think he was an employee of theirs but there was also a gentleman going around making and giving out balloon animals/shapes, he was absolutely terrific with my nephew and even had me laughing, he was definitely the icing on the already amazing cake for this experience."}
{"text":"What a waste of money, burgers stink fries are horrible. I could've spent less money and got a better burger at inn n out. I don't know what all of the hype is about. Will meet step foot in a red robin again, I'd rather eat dog food."}
{"text":"There last night. I thought the service was poor as a whole.  Our server was ok, but we noticed drinks at the bar just sitting there waiting on the servers to pick them up. In fact, a beer sat so long the waitress used a straw to swirl it around to make it look like it just came out of the tap. No manager around either. Food took too long too. Not going back unless someone gets me a gift card, but I doubt that will happen too"}
{"text":"There were 7 of us for lunch, I had called ahead and a table was waiting for us.  We had a great waitress and good service.  The food, as always, was delicious.  My burger and onion rings were the best.  We all got something different and the meals all looked good.  We stayed and talked, probably longer than we should have, and were not rushed out in any way.  Very accomodating and we felt very welcome."}
{"text":"Love Red Robin's burgers!!!! Had the new cheesey style burgers. Loaded. Loaded I tell you!!!!! My wife got one of the new cheesey dinners as well!!!! Excellent!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a number of times. Each time, the service has not been great. We have waited too long for menus, drinks, and for our order to be taken. We were given our food and still had no silverware. Three separate people in our party asked for silverware at different times. We still never received it and had to walk up to the hostess to get some on our own so we could eat our food! The food and drinks are pretty good but I will never return to this location due to the poor service."}
{"text":"Food was ok, not worth the 20+ dollars per person and everything was so greasy. Service wasn't anything special, waitress brought us the wrong drinks and rarely checked in us. I know they have a button to call her but I don't feel comfortable using it. I noticed food, dirt caked between the booth and wall. They must rarely clean there. Doubt I'll be returning."}
{"text":"This places is a joke been there three times manager and staff have there heads up in the clouds. Waited 20min to get seated at the bar top lol I said no they told me I would have to wait another 10 to get a table. I walk out"}
{"text":"Visited location today with my girlfriend and her daughter. We were helped by Cassandra who was nice. I ordered the fiery ghost pepper burger with a side of garlic herb fries. My girlfriend ordered the new BBQ pork burger with a side of regular steak fries. Her daughter ordered a kids pizza and a side of fries. 

It took a while to get our food but not terribly long. None the less both my fries and my girlfriends fries were cold but we were so hungry we just decided to eat them. My girlfriends daughter didn't get her pizza at least 15-20 minutes after we received our meals. So Cassandra offered to bring her out some fries while we waited. By the time her pizza came out my food along with my girlfriends was cold as well. 

When we first ordered our meals we asked for 2 sauces for my girlfriend and myself. It took us asking Cassandra 3 additional times to finally get some dipping sauce 20 mins after receiving our already cold food. 

My girlfriend was not pleased with her BBQ pulled pork burger. It came with pickles after she asked Cassandra to have them removed. And I never received my garlic herb fries. Over all this was a tough Sunday evening experience, I'm moving to this area and I really hope this isn't the normal service because this is my is one of my family's favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Came to Red Robin tonight to get a little R&R time after being at the hospital all afternoon and server Rachel was terrific! So attentive and friendly! She suggested the pretzel bite appetizer which was delicious, and helped accommodate for a little protein swap on the BLTA Crossaint to make it a BLCA instead! My mother enjoyed a nice frozen margarita on happy hour with the promise that I'd get us safely back across the street! All and all a wonderful experience and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The host was really nice, but the waitress was straight ass. I feel the service sucked because I looked young, honestly. But I'm a paying customer and it's unacceptable to treat anyone different than you would a more \"distinguished\" looking customer. She gave us the wrong drinks which we were charged for and slammed them on the table and asked \"y'all ready or not\". The food runner came and was very nice but we were not checked on for at least 15 minutes. As a waiter myself, I would get an ass chewing for doing so. Meanwhile she continued to serve everyone around us, while having a smile on her face. Everyone except for us. After another 15 minutes of waiting she came over to see if we were ready to pay. I informed her of the charged drinks, she fixed it, then slammed the computer thing in front of me. At this point I'm pretty pissed off. I honestly contemplated leaving the restaurant without paying. Sadly I don't remember her name because I would've put her on blast on here. I find it shitty because I frequent this restaurant and always get really great service. Just not this time. I'll most likely come back again because my little brothers like the food. But on God if I get her as my waitress again, I'm dipping out of there and going across the street to eat island sushi. * drops mic"}
{"text":"Every time i come it gets worse; prices continue to go up at the same fast rate quality goes down. Even kids are disappointed after the latest trip; they don't sing for birthdays anymore, no helium balloons, no colorable kid menus w crayons etc.  For the adults what were once six dollar burger are now over $10 ea; increasing at a rate of just under a dollar a year per burger. Also the menu was once simple, one sheet front/back but now its a spiral bound book...also the bottomless fries come cold in tiny cups. not impressed, wont be back unless the royal robin or whiskey river come down in price.  For now i'm converting to smashburger which has passed robin in quality at a lower cost."}
{"text":"We are here it is 12:30 and the restaurant is not busy. Sitting in the bar area. Marla our server is horrible. Hasn't come to check on us. My daughter needs a refill and the server is no where to be found. Portions are tiny for the price you pay. I didn't leave a tip. She is just awful. Will never come back."}
{"text":"I've visited this Red Robin a few times.  I don't know... but I think a $9 burger should be top notch but it never does it for me.  However there is never a long wait and the service is always good.  Food wise, I'm sorry but the burgers at In n Out down the street are hands down better, even if they don't come with jalepenos or pineapple or whatever :)"}
{"text":"Went in today at around 1:15 and they were pretty busy. Seated right away in the bar area. Our server, Loretta, was there right away and got our drink orders. She was back in a timely matter with our drinks and took our food orders. I work in the biz and I noticed she was also the bartender and looked to have about 8 tables too. Loretta was awesome, you could tell she was busy but she stayed very attentive and was great!!! I wonder where the FOH manager was...they should've been around helping her out!! Oh and the food was on point as well!! i'll be back and when I do I will definitely be sitting in Loretta's station!!!"}
{"text":"I normally don't take the time to leave yelp reviews, however, the service I received here tonight exceeded my expectations and deserves a 5 star review.  My boyfriend and I came for dinner and we were served by Naomi. 

Many servers do not pick up on the vibes of their tables- are the customers in mid conversation or do they have food in their mouth?  These are the moments when you should not ask how the food is.  Its very awkward trying to respond and chew at the same time.  Naomi timed this out perfectly.  She remembered our requests/modifications and was prompt in checking up on us and bringing extra fries, condiments, etc. I applaud management for training competent employees.  Naomi deserves praise and recognition for her work.  GIVE HER A RAISE.  :)"}
{"text":"Slow service...botched order 5 times.... I waited 20 minutes for a fork and napkin. Ridiculous! Never again. On a slow Wednesday night really?"}
{"text":"Went out for a nice family lunch this fine Friday afternoon. Thought red robin would be a great choice as opposed to Chevy's, hostess greeted us just fine got us our table in a timely manner. However the server we were given, seemed as if he was under pressure, in a rush, and rude. Asked us what we'd like to drink so we got our water and coke. Never received a refill after that, When I asked said, \"I'll bring it right over!\" Never came and asked again and never got it. Got my order wrong, never came by for refills, was rude to neighboring tables and could clearly see the look on their faces. Asked for a basket of fries and get them shoved in my face before I could even finish my sentence. And they were clearly from the table behind us that didn't want theirs with salt on it. Watched as the bus boy cleared a table and wipe with a dry rag. Cleaning our table as we usually do before we leave a restaurant, and dropped a cup of ranch on the floor. Asked another server for a rag or napkins, given 2 napkins to clean it up I asked the hostess for a rag because all I did was smear it, she said I'll bring you one, never did. As I saw our server to get the check he was bringing drinks to the table behind us, left a trail of water spilling out of the glass and 3 other employees walked right over it over a 5 minute period. I got the check left the money our server immediately grabbed it walked away and then said thanks for coming in. On the way out alerted the hostess that she never got the rag, then she said , \"oh I'll get right on that \" Didn't get a thank you or have a nice day. All in all poor service, can't get a simple order right and no one has any concern for safety. Safe to say won't be returning to this location any time soon"}
{"text":"Our out-of-town guest wanted to try Red Robin for their \"gourmet burgers\". He ordered a bacon cheeseburger and another person ordered the barbecue burger. The server asked  them if they wanted the burgers cooked pink or not pink. They both requested pink but both burgers came out not-pink. The server said they could make another burger but as they went through a conveyor belt she couldn't guarantee they would be pink. The manager did comp the burgers - but the point is that a conveyor belt burger is not a handmade gourmet burger.
I did like the chicken tortilla soup."}
{"text":"We went at 9PM on a Saturday and the crowds had left by then.  The service was extraordinary but I had expected more from the food.  The Fried Pickles, a favorite appetizer that more restaurants seem to be serving lately, were poor quality, not very tasty and coated with a thick coating that had more taste than the pickle.  The serving size was stingy for a $5 appetizer.   The basic red robin cheeseburger was a disappointment, not very tasty and condiments on the burger were stingy.  The gourmet burgers on the menu looked tempting but the prices were too expensive and better values can be found at other local restaurants."}
{"text":"I have always loved Red Robin, but have never had a good experiences at this specific location. Every time we go we have bad service and a long wait. 

The drinks were watered down/ I kept going back to try and five them a few more chances but I am done with this specific location. If I am in Centennial and need a burger I will go to SMASH Burger."}
{"text":"Ordered a whiskey river bbq burger medium well, got served a patty that was cooked fine on one side but the other was charred to the point it was inedible due to the taste. The bottomless fries were thin, hard and almost stale...this is out of the norm as a year ago this place was actually pretty good, not now. With smash burger down the street there's no point to come here, especially due to their policy of no legal firearms on their premises.  Guess they don't realize signage holds no weight in Nevada and they must think criminals won't walk past that sign.  Their loss five guys or smash burger it is."}
{"text":"We did a call ahead seating for a birthday dinner for 20 on September 21 for 630pm seating. Spoke with the manager about details. When we arrived we were seated within 15 minutes of our arrival. The server was on it and the food and service were great. The manager came up a few times to check on us to make sure everything was good. they were even accommodating with split checks. I know sometimes that can be a pain, but the server didn't even flinch when I mentioned it. Great family restaurant but were very thankful they made our large dinner party run smoothly."}
{"text":"We always put in an order for pickup. Therefore, I can't comment on the service or atmosphere really. The bartenders who help with the pick up are always super nice though. The food is spot on every time. We love Red Robin, and I can't pass up a good guacamole bacon burger."}
{"text":"Only reason they're getting two stars is because the food was alright. Ordered the ghost tavern.. Burger was good and I love their fries.. That being said the customer service was horrible! This seems to be a recurring issue every time we go. The only reason we go back is because the food is decent. We only saw our server once and that was to take our orders. I ordered an appetizer and that was never brought out..when I finally did get the attention of another server to let them know we were out of ketchup and needed more they brought us back a bottle that expired in June and  was PURPLE! And when they advertise bottomless fries I expect to get bottomless fries. Not one small basket of 6 fries throughout my entire meal. I've also eaten at the red Robbins on eastern and the service there was not much better..Red Robbins needs to get some serious training on customer service asap because I'm pretty sure a 10 year old could do better!"}
{"text":"Order was not staged, ordered wings as an appatizer they were cold, frys were cold, burger temp not great, refills took entirely to long, seemed rushed out after we asked for check, ordered a burger thinking it would count as our free birthday burger to later find out that it did not. Manager never came to check on us. Normally when we stop at a Red Robin we almost always see the manager in the dining room. This will be our last trip to this location. Very Disappointed!"}
{"text":"My family of five & I frequent Red Robin at least twice a month.  We had been in Flagstaff for a few days & saw their new commercial for their new items.  The don't have any locations in Flagstaff so when we returned home we went to the Superstition Springs location for dinner.  It was a Tuesday night after 7:30 PM so we figured we would have pretty good service.  

The Manager seated us quickly.  Our waiter came & didn't introduce himself.  I hate that. Luckily the manager told us his name.  \"J\" took   our drink order.  When he came back we had some questions.  We were wondering if the $4.79 salad price was discounted with an entree item?  \"J\" informed us that we could order a salad as a side & it would be smaller or the bottomless fries would come with our burgers as a side.  Everyone ordered their usual.  I decided to try the new \"Mt. Olympus Burger\" with the garlic mayo on the side.  \"J\" seemed to only have two other tables he was tending to.  \"J\" forgot my son's pickles on the side, we had to remind him a couple of times for extra napkins and we had to \"flag him down\" a few times to fill our iced teas (my husband had a cold).  

My husband noticed that they had started to rescue the miners in Chile on one of the t.v.s near the other side of the restaurant.  We were the only people on our side of the place, I asked \"J\" if he could turn the channel so that we could see the news.  \"J\" seemed confused but went to ask the bartender.  \"J\" said that the bartender told him that it wasn't the news but they had just cut in to the soccer game.  (They were both wrong)  We had been straining to watch it the entire time we had been there and it was on half screen since it was LIVE HISTORICAL BREAKING NEWS.  My children had wanted to watch the rescue as well because we had been explaining it to them.  My young son asked why we didn't get to watch what we had asked for?  My husbad told him that the waiter was confussed way back when he started taking our order & we would have to wait until we got home to see it.  I had tried to flag down the manager but he was BUSY.  We noticed how the bartender & the manager stood watching the channel we wanted on the 3 t.v.s by the front/bar.

We finally had a visit from the waiter for more tea & ordered more chocolate milk for our children.   He offered us some dessert and realized that he hadn't yet offered us some more steak fries.  So we accepted the offer for more fries.  The waiter FAILED to mention that everyone's refills were free except my oldest son's.  Two chocolate milks for him were almost $6!!  (I am pretty sure I could get a gallon @ Walmart for less than that).  When I noticed that on the bill I ordered a cup for him and one for me for the rest of my iced tea.  

\"J\" came back and said that they had to put in a fresh order of fries for us.  Perhaps he was wishing we wish decline the order.  We had ordered a box for my daughter's leftovers when we ordered the cups.  The box came and no cups.  We reminded \"J\" again.   By the time the fries showed up everyone was done \"nursing their hamburgers\" and my son was falling asleep.  We finally got our cups so we packed up our cold burger and our new fries and headed home.

Food was good but service was sadly lacking. Perhaps we will make the extra drive to the Tempe location next time.
:-("}
{"text":"The mac and cheese is off tha chain ... Burgers , fries everything... Love this place"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Upon arrival we were seated and our server promptly came over to ask for our drink order.  She was very matter of fact and certainly didn't exude friendliness. When we tried to order our appetizer she was a bit snarky telling us she doesn't take appetizer orders and that we should order them ourselves off the kiosk on the table.  She attempted to show us how to order from the table then got frustrated because the machine wasn't working. She said she would be back after she activated the machine.  She walked away annoyed.  She returned, placed our app order and her demeanor was a bit nicer, she took our dinner order at this time as well. 
We then proceeded to wait 40 minutes with no appetizers nor visit from the server. We were just about to walk out and go somewhere else for dinner when our meals arrived.  No appetizers just our entrees. (cold) We told the kind young lady that brought our food we hadn't received our appetizers but no longer wanted them.  A few minutes after we received our entrees our server showed up with the appetizers.  
We sent them back.
The likelihood of us returning is slim to none however, I gave this review two stars for one reason alone and that would be the assistant manager Doreen.  She tried to make everything as right as possible.  She took over for our server and was extremely attentive. She did an amazing job when put in a situation with unhappy customers."}
{"text":"I LOVE RED ROBINS but definitely NOT this one. I've been THREE times & short of the nice greeters this place is NOT good. 1 trip)after waiting 20m(at the bar w/3 other ppl)..on a Tuesday.., I finally had to ASK for water. Then the bottomless fries were heat lamp warm & the BBQ whiskey burger barely had any BBQ. 2nd trip)I waited 50m for a Bleu Burger, coleslaw, a pathetic small slice of NOT Mile High dessert. When I asked the manager could I get another piece, as it was melted, he was exceptionally annoyed & gave me another piece WITHOUT ANY HOT FUDGE & the other fixins(as shown by my picture, & the 3rd trip- well you yet the jist. Seriously had HIGH hopes. It was the 1st & DEFINITELY the last 3 times Ill be frequenting Champaign's Red Robin.Good Luck"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Our server Jack was very attentive to our table. There menu is ridiculous...in a good way! Can never decide what I want. First time having the tropical mai tai, not what I expected but hey, after my M-F, 8-5, I wasn't complaining! Wait time to get in was a little long but it is a Friday night."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times and my meal has always been fresh and good tasting. The mountain high mud pie is always great if you have the room for it after dinner!"}
{"text":"I had sworn off Red Robin because of the horrible service that we received twice in Centennial Hills, Las Vegas. I like the food, but I refuse to eat somewhere with bad service. When the new one in Downtown Summerlin opened, I figured we'd give it a shot. The service was incredible and the staff was extremely pleasant, friendly and fast. When a part of my order was accidentally missed, it was corrected immediately and with many apologies. I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant but horrible service! The hostess was a better waitress. Our waiter messed up our drinks, he never came back to offer more drinks, he never came back with our fries we ordered, the food was cold, especially the fries he never did anything. I had to get up multiple times to get what I needed especially going to the bar to get my drink refilled. Don't even bother complaining or you'll get kicked out by the female manager...STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS RED ROBIN BAD SERVICE!!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is good but it isn't great.  The drinks and fries were good and so was the service but the problem consisted with the fatty burger patties.  When we got one of the gourmet burgers there was an excess of fat drippings on the plate after taking bites."}
{"text":"We stopped eating here a few years ago because it was hard to get an allergy menu, but now they have a great food allergy menu on their website.  Our first time back, our server Dana was very knowledgeable about the menu...down to what ingredients go into them and how they are prepared.  She was amazing and helpful in making the right selection for our allergy needs.  And the food was great!

We usually can't get fries anywhere because of cross contamination, but their fries are cooked in dedicated fryers.  Do we all enjoyed fries for a change!  They even had a gluten free bun for my burger (not listed on the menu, so ask when you go)."}
{"text":"I've only had one bad experience so far with a waiter but otherwise I love eating here! Usually I get Brent and he is great! I recommend either the guacamole bacon burger, or the burning love if you like spice!"}
{"text":"We heard back from red Robin and they did a great job to make our experience much better the next time that we went.  I really appreciate their efforts to improve and provide great customer service."}
{"text":"Not impressed. in all fairness, i didn't get a burger, because i had just had one that day and it wasnt my choice to go there.. i had ava\"cobb\"o salad, my wife had a bbq grilled chicken sand, and my daughter had a turkey burger. all of which were pretty bad. my salad was very soggy, there was about and 8th of an avacado on it, and it was just all around bad. the chicken sandwich was dry, the breast needed pounded a little before grilling because it was huge in the middle and thin on the ends.. bland. the bbq sauce was good at least! the onion straws were soggy and sooo salty. horrible. the turkey burger was the worst by far. i mean i dont even know what they did to make it so disgusting but it was absolutely nasty. i remember going here 5 or so years ago and thinking the burgers were pretty good, so i would suggest getting a burger. dont you dare get anything else! service was pretty good at least.. drinks are good too.. if you could give a place 2.5 stars id go with that.. and for the guy that says the turkey burgers are good, dont take his word for it, a lot of people think edible=good"}
{"text":"Red Robin with besty and BF after drinking!! Had amazing service from James! Go bottomless fries. Yummy"}
{"text":"On May 2, 2013 a group of friends and I came here to grab a burger before a movie.

Four of us became incredibly ill only hours after eating here and we were all sick for 3-4 days afterward. Two of the other members who came with us did not get ill.

Apologies, I would have written something more timely, but just getting around to it now. I've eaten at other Red Robin's before and never had an issue. It appears it's just this location."}
{"text":"For this review I am only rating the FOOD. (Server/Service was fine). For a place that prides themselves on having \"Gourmet Burgers\" they fall short, that's for sure. I ordered their signature Cheeseburger. And I can, in one word sum it up- \"Whopper\".  Yup it tasted like Burger King. Granted, I haven't ate BK in many many years. But that distinct seeded bun and weird sauce stuck with me. I can say for sure that was the worst cheeseburger I have ever had in my entire life. Yuck."}
{"text":"I've been dining at Red Robin since it first popped up in the area over 15 yes ago.  I have Loved every meal and experience until tonight at Red Robin in Orange. Off Harvard rd.
The place was pretty slow yet waited nearly 25 mins for a bowl of soup. Then I got buzz clucks and mac and cheese. The chicken was dry yet OK at best. 
The mac and cheese had to be sent back because it literally was \"out of the fridge\" cold. Very disappointed.  
Will still eat at Red Robin since the good times far outweigh this one bad experience but man that was rough."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but.....Why would you advertise 'unlimited fries' when no one comes to check to see if you need more fries? The food was very good, however, I finished my 10 fries and my first and only soda within the first third of the meal.  I couldn't reorder a drink on the table app since I didn't order the drink from the app, I ordered it from the waiter.  He never bothered to check back on us and I couldn't get his attention.  Perhaps he was just too busy.  I would have loved another order of 10 fries but I just couldn't wait that long.  I was given a gift card for $75.00 to Red Robin for my B-Day but I don't think I'll bother going back!  Free or not....."}
{"text":"I love this location because once you leave if you still have things to do after you eat you have many options to choose from especially with the Costco in walking distance. The location is in Tempe just east of Priest and Elliot! Come check it out and try the Royal Burger!!!

Service was good, it's actually been good every time I'm up here and I love the Royal burger! That's the burger with a fried egg on top very good I'd rate that burger in my top 10 of all burgers tasted! 

Now on to the doughnut tower!!!"}
{"text":"This visit started off on a bad foot, but it really wasn't the fault of the waitstaff. It was pretty busy but not quite busy enough for the 10 minute wait for drinks, the forgetting of silverware, the forgetting of our appetizer, or the mistake in our order (I ordered broccoli as a side instead of fries but got fries anyway). I know, this sounds like it's just going downhill. However, our server was incredibly apologetic for the mistakes and let his manager know what happened. From there, it was amazing. Our appetizer was out in minutes and my broccoli in seconds. The app was comped and an additional 25 percent on top of that. It was at this point the manager went above and beyond. She sat at the table, personally apologized, and handed me a $15 gift card. I was blown away. At no time have I ever received that much sincere care and worry about the quality of my dining experience. That alone will keep me coming back to this Red Robin. The manager, Rebecca, truly cares about her restaurant and its customers. Fantastic."}
{"text":"My Husband, my In laws & I came for dinner. We waited an hour to get our food & when we got our food it was cold. They remade our food & manager was nice & took half off our bill which was awesome but if we go somewhere to eat we don't want to wait an hour to eat & then get cold hamburgers....."}
{"text":"We've been to Red Robin's in several cities and this one compares favorably with the others. Burgers are really good and herb garlic fries with aioli garlic dip are great. Menu is kind of hard to read. Chicken sandwiches good too. Our server was friendly and came back to our table a couple of times to ask if we wanted more fries, drink refills etc. Negatives: too noisy, kind of stress inducing. Who decided that those ridiculous and uncomfortable bistro tables were a good idea?  Ditto the little tiny booths for two. If it's winter and you have a jacket and scarf, purse etc there is barely room for a person!"}
{"text":"I don't order burgers at Red Robin because they won't cook them less than medium-well.  I ordered the chicken cobb salad.  Big mistake. The salad ingredients were good but the chicken breast was horrible. It didn't taste like chicken and the texture was rubbery.  It's apparent they use low-quality, frozen breasts that are injected with some kind of solution that keeps them from drying out completely, but does nothing to improve them.  My daughter's fish was overcooked and my granddaughter's grilled cheese was stale.  I also had a cup of french onion soup that was flavorless and overloaded with mozzarella. Our server, Neisha, was very attentive.  Any decent sit-down restaurant, however, wouldn't let this food out of the kitchen.  It was no better than Wendy's, but cost three times more."}
{"text":"My review is for the quality of their staff, not for the restaurant itself, since I did not eat there on my visit. 

I recently purchased gift cards for a school event, but instead of receiving three $10 cards, I received one $30 card, an understandable, albeit frustrating mistake. Unfortunately, restaurant policy is that you cannot purchase a gift card with another gift card, so there was nothing to be done. I ended up rebuying the cards out of pocket. 

Regardless: The manager, a friendly, classy man named Drew, provided me with about eight free app/dessert cards for my school in order to try to make up for it, and apologized profusely, while the bartender, a compassionate angel of a woman named Terri who ran around like a whirlwind taking care of orders, felt so badly over my out-of-pocket expense that she comped my malted milkshake. 

For no other reason than this uncommon display of friendliness and compassion, I'll be back to this Red Robin, and soon. These two represented their company fantastically, and this broke teacher is very grateful for it."}
{"text":"We tried this place 3 different times and all 3 times it took forever for our food to come out and all 3 times our food was COLD!!! And to top it off service is horrible!!! 

On 3/12/14 we wanted to give this place another chance because we wanted to support Darnell elementary. So we did and again food took forever and our food was cold. We a kids chicken strip which was overcooked and cold. We also got a kids cheese pizza which was undercooked (doughy)and cold. We also got a blue burger which was soggy and cold. The only thing that was hot was the bottomless fries (which was really good, got to give the credit for that) I'm sorry but never again."}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of town and decided to try one of our favorite back home restaurants. Our server Loren was such a sweetheart. She was professional and made us feel right at home. I've always loved the barbecue burger and I wasn't disappointed. The service was top notch and I would definitely return on my next trip out to vegas"}
{"text":"I went to Red Robin the other night to get my free birthday burger. I got the Bleu Ribbon Burger, which was the best Bleu Ribbon Burger I ever got here. I ordered it medium and got it perfectly cooked, which usually gets over cooked at many restaurants. The fries were super fresh and was extremely impressed and even called the store after I got home to compliment the cook (Justin)."}
{"text":"I will never go to a restaurant that charges money as an entertainment fee to play the stupid table games while you are waiting on food. How ridiculous. Brought it up to the manager who called us liars for not seeing the fee warning before playing. No one ever told us either. I will never go to a place that just wants to rip customers off. I will go tel Buffalo wild wings instead."}
{"text":"We went for a burger and milkshake early on a Saturday, because so many times we drive by and the place is packed. Even at 3:30 today it was busy, but we were seated quick in the bar section. Mostly adult diners in this part of the restaurant, so no noisy kids today.  Made for an enjoyable meal.
We noticed a nice shady outdoor patio, so might try that next time.
Our server was Bre and what a great job she did; friendly, efficient and cheerful. Food arrived hot and we really liked the Tavern burger -- never tried it before. Great flavor and a slightly smaller size.
Job well-done Red Robin !"}
{"text":"My husband and I went into have my favored BBQ chicken salad , and a burger for him , I was so sad it was so bad food and service had to ask for everything and wait longer for her to bring it to us . On the plus side the seaters are on the ball great job girls , she got our drinks and frys for us."}
{"text":"Went to red robin on April 26, 2014 at 5:20 pm. We were ignored for 20 minutes before finally being offered something to drink. Food was great. We had the grilled chicken sandwich,  pizza, and a burger.  Took 20 minutes to get more fries. Waitress constantly ignored our table. Great food. Poor service.  Wouldn't recommend this place during peak times if you want decent service. I may go back on a tuesday or another less busy time."}
{"text":"Love their fish, onion rings, bottomless steak fries & their chocolate shakes.

Wow....i am getting HUNGRY just thinking about this food...

YUM.:)"}
{"text":"Brought my teenage kids in for a late lunch/early dinner (4 pm) and happen to catch them at shift change and a close to empty place. We were seated immediately and service came in a reasonable time. Our waitress was great! Would definitely ask for Brandillynn again! The food was fast and yummm...as always. However, shortly after ordering a couple and their son came in and was seated a booth away. After stopping the hostess and asking, \"is our waitress going to come?\", the hostess immediately went and grabbed their waitress and both came back, explained about shift change and apologized profusely. The couple proceeded to argue and ultimately demanded the manager. Daniel appeared a few minutes later to help the family, whose chief complaint was the waitress was too loud whilst apologizing! Seriously? Too loud? All while we are listening to their complaints! The manager again apologized while they interrupted with more complaints. Obviously their experience occupied our meal but I want to commend the staff here at Red Robin for going way above and beyond. We were truly impressed by their professionalism and the service. I guess you just can't make some people happy!!"}
{"text":"All I am going to say is that our server Miranda was the worst waitress we have EVER had by far at any restaurant!!!!!! She obviously hates her job because you could read it all over her face! I have never been so appalled with food service in my life! You have defenitely lost my family as customers!! GOODBYE!"}
{"text":"I love the Bleu Ribbon burger. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I had a coupon for a free dessert but I couldn't use it because I also had a coupon for a free birthday burger. Our waitress went out of her way to bring me a free sundae for my birthday even though I couldn't use the coupon I had. Very thoughtful! We will definitely go back to this location!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight - last time I was at Red Robin was 25 years ago. What a GREAT treat: The food was AWESOME, the restaurant was clean, our server was helpful, patient, and sincerely wanted us to have a pleasant dining experience. (Yay, Jorden - it was. :))    The \"bottomless fries\" are unlimited as advertised, but the container they came in was bottomless, literally, too, lol.  We got a kick out of that. We will definitely be back.  THANK YOU, Melissa, you know who you are. ;)

{"text":"Four words.  Royal - Red - Robin - Burger.  Main reason I go there.  Such a good burger with the nice little fried egg on top.  Yes an egg on your burger....try it.  Good place to bring your family.  This location always has good service."}
{"text":"Every time we come here it's always so good! Granted when they are slammed we may have to wait a few mins longer but hey would would you expect ! Always fun and everyone is always so friendly!!"}
{"text":"Took forever for a salad to come out and when it did it came with all of the other foods? the cheese sticks were COLD and refills took a while.... not sure it was the waitress fault i get the feeling it was the cooks fault"}
{"text":"Had to call 3 times and let it ring forever just to make a Togo order. Then once it was made he said \"let me make sure I have some\". He came back on the phone and said it would be ready in 5-10 minutes. it wasn't. We waited a while inside. They seemed to be short handed which was only comical because 5 minute after I arrived a server left without offering to help me and there was one standing outside alone in the dark- very safe. Worst location I have been to."}
{"text":"I never mind going to Red Robin, and I don't think I've ever had a bad experience. Today, however, was fantastic. The crew at this location were able to get our large party seated and taken care of in a timely manner. Our, waiter, Felix I believe, was excellent, well organized and was able to accommodate our request for a split check. Well done! I appreciate a casual eatery going above and beyond, and I appreciate you being friendly. The food was good as and well!"}
{"text":"Red Robin, you're breaking my heart. You used to be my legit favorite restaurant (in my college days) but after a few too many poor experiences, tonight you put the final nail in the coffin. 

I arrived with my husband and 1-year-old son at 6:30 on a Saturday night. 15 minute wait- that's fine, to be expected for a weekend evening. We were seated and things were busy, but not packed. We made our orders (two bacon cheeseburgers, nothing complicated) and requested some fries before our meals to keep our son happy. Our waiter said he'd try, but that the kitchen was barely keeping up with fries that evening so he didn't know how long it would be. (I saw several other tables with fries laid out before their meals.) But assuming he only meant a few more minutes, we said no problem and pulled out some graham crackers for him. 

45 minutes and an embarrassing amount of graham crackers later, there was still nothing at our table. Our waiter stopped by 30 minutes into it and said it would just be \"a few more moments\". After another 15 minutes my husband convinced me that it was time to go. We left a couple of bucks for his soda and left. 

There never seemed to be any sort of hurry, our waiter rarely checked on us, and we were most frustrated because our son was doing really well for the first half hour. As he became hungrier and impatient, so did we. We were two hours from home and still needed to get on the road so we settled for fast food. 

We had good times, Red Robin, but you've treated me badly for too long. It's time to move on!"}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing worth 14.50. Every table has those table computers to order and pay or play games. Used to really like Red Robin."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I went to this location to have a quick lunch. We were seated in the bar area (no problem with that), but it took the server bartender 23 minutes to acknowledge us. I always look @ my watch when I'm seated because I am a server. We both order the chicken sandwich, mine without the bun. When the food was delivered my chicken was very dried out & bland. I ate it anyway because I was hungry. Our server never came never came back to check on us. We paid the check @ the table with that ipad machine. Very disappointed with everything. While @ home, 5hours later I started getting severe stomach cramps, I then puked up everything I ate. This went on all night. I had a bad case of food poisoning. The next day, my stomach was raw. I couldn't keep anything down or in me. You guys need to get your act together & check out who is handling the food & how long you leave it sitting there before you serve it to a customer. Thank God my boyfriend didn't get sick also. We will never return. Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. My family enjoyed our visit. Our waiter did a good job following up with our table."}
{"text":"A great place to catch up with friends. Good service and good food. Friday night gets busy so go early.

The Bleu Cheese burger had enough Bleu to enjoy without being overwhelming. I don't usually like onions but the onion straws at the bottom of the burger were not bad. The best part was the tangy sauce!

Sad to say the chocolate cake with ice cream was quite dry."}
{"text":"I went in to Red Robin tonight because it was \"Jim Day\"  to promote the return of the Jim Beam burger and my name just happens to be James. I walked over to the bar and the bartender Amanda came over right away and took my order. The free burger didn't come with fries, but they were offered to me so I added them on. I also ordered a beer while I waited for my food. 

The burger and fries came out pretty fast and was delivered with ranch as well, which is always nice to not have to ask for. Amanda checked on me shortly after it came out to see if I needed anything. While I enjoyed my meal, the manager (didn't catch his name) who was working on various things said hello several times and asked me how the food was and called me by name (apparently he had been told I was taking them up on the free burger promo). Overall I found the staff to be very pleasant and I actually felt like they were glad I participated in the promo and appreciated me coming in as opposed to being treated like a freeloader who just came in for a cheap meal. 

To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the food at Red Robin, the burgers are good and the fries are okay, but I keep coming back to this location because the staff has always been consistently pleasant at this location. 5/5 for service, 4/5 for food, rounding up because I was treated right. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"After a bad experience, and reaching out to the manager thanks for making it right!!"}
{"text":"Once we got seated our server Brittni was right over and took our drink order.  Came back to take our food order once drinks came out.  BUT NEVER PUT OUR ORDER IN!! We waited OVER an hour before she notice that we still had not received our food. In actuality she never noticed as she was to busy being a chatter box with someone she new across from us.  Never came over to see how we were doing until the people she was chatting with were leaving.  Came over to us and apologized as she said our food ticket was never entered....hmmmm I wonder why?  Said the manager would be over to talk to me.  Well, the manager came over about 10 minutes later with our food.  DIDNT INTRODUCE himself as a manager.  Just came out gave us our food.....as a manager I would have expected A LOT more ESPECIALLY when a paying customer waited over an hour for food.  I did not walk out as I had my son with me who had begged for red robin.  I didn't enjoy my food and my son noticed I was furious that he didnt  enjoy his either.  I was done.   Ate half my burger and pulled my card out to check out.  What's  hilarious was the \"manager discount \" that I received which just topped it off.  I will NEVER go to this Red Robin location."}
{"text":"They are not perfect but their customer service makes up for it! This location has an amazing management team who goes out of their way to personalize their service and take care of the customer. I facilitate customer service training, so I am a tough critic. I will continue to go to this location because of the leadership present."}
{"text":"Usually like this chain but this location is really awful. Why? The server was rude, I told Ashley that the appetizer (sweet potato fries and fried zucchini) were undercooked. We did eat them, so I was just letting her know as the kitchen manger should know about issues like that. Then I got my medium rare burger cooked well done. The burger was slopped together and nasty. The fries were undercooked. You can tell the cooks there don't care at all about quality. We ordered a chicken  caeser wrap that was closer to rabbit food. Again,bad management.  When Ashley asked if I wanted a new one I said no thank you as the cooks don't know what they are doing, she then stated that I was having a bad night. Apart from the awful food I could have done without her curt fake attitude she so carefully developed as a disgruntled server. To top it all off they not only did not take the burger off the check but added an extra burger on the check like we wouldn't notice. Again, bad management. In the end they corrected the check but I will not eat at this place again. I'd be interested to see if the kitchen cleanliness matches the food and service quality."}
{"text":"Food has always been perfect. We have always gotten our food quickly and cooked to perfection. One thing I really love is they allow dogs on the patio. The patio is private, relaxing and they bring a water bowl for the dogs. Have seen the bartenders snip at the waitresses, quite a few times, but overall food and service it great."}
{"text":"We've had few issues at this location

1. We were looking for late night food. Online, the hours were listed until 12a, the door said 11p. I wrote an e-mail to the manager, who offered free food, that I didn't take him up on, but they did correct the door to 12a, which we noted on our next visit. I really wasn't complaining for free food, I just wanted the issue fixed. 

2. One time (out of at least a dozen we've been) around 10pm, we waited at least 15 minutes to have a waiter come to our table. We finally got a manger who immediately brought out an appetizer and put a discount on our bill for the issue.

Beyond that, everything has been spectacular. My son loves going for balloons. The food is decent, hot and as pictured. We love the unlimited refills on root beer floats. I've honestly never had an unfriendly waiter no matter the time of day we go, which is impressive, in my opinion."}
{"text":"We, a co-worker and I, have eaten here a few times over the last couple of months.  The quality of their gourmet burgers seemed to be almost the same quality as the regular menu items, just loaded with additional vegetables and sauces, which, to me, does not really constitute the price discrepancy between the items.  The food is normally what you would expect for a chain burger restaurant and they did a decent job this last trip with cooking it to specification, but it can be hit or miss.  I tried out the Whiskey B-B-Q Burger this last trip and would give it a thumbs up.

The service can also be very hit-or-miss at this location as well.  We have had times in the past when it was busy and the staff were constantly checking our drink levels and making sure that we had everything that we needed.  On this trip, we were there shortly before any lunch rush had occurred but we almost never saw the waitress outside of the initial order and to check on us once before we paid our check.  The staff at the front was available when we first walked in and they were friendly and quick to seat us so there was not a long wait before being able to sit in the locations dining room.

At the end of the day, I would return to the restaurant in the future for lunch or dinner as it is a good alternative to some of the other options in the area."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Red Robin location and the Sunset location for years.  So much so that I'm very aware of the ups and downs of their service and management changes.  One of the visits we had was so bad I stopped going to either location.  
Last Monday my family and I came in for abirthday dinner.   I just want to say Eric the night manager was running this restaurant smoothly. I appreciate his fast and friendly service. Long story short, I wouldn't mind going again at this Eastern location 
as long as he's running the restaurant."}
{"text":"Burgers are always on point! Food is great. The only bad part of most of the time is SERVICE!! Every time we go on the weekend it's always busy as expected but they should always have more staff. We went on my husbands birthday on a Thursday and had terrible service. Wasn't busy but server was lacking. She forgot to ring in my margarita, had to mention and got it right before our meal. We also didn't have no napkins or silverware and didn't get any until halfway our meal. All I asked for was my pesto on the side of burger and it wasn't even brought out. Let's just say I didn't expect for dinner to be this bad for special occasion. Not the best place to go if you're trying to eat and be out of there. Expect to stay an hour and a half to two for a simple meal. Least at this location."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this location since 2006, staff was always friendly,great service and food. But the last two times I've been in there the food has not been \"All that great\" I need So much Mayo on my burger that's all I could really taste.. in till of course I scraped it off...I mean WOW. Not only that But our Server...who's name I won't put out there..charged my card for my meal and charged my card for somebody else's meal. She said she  \"Voided\" it but my bank has still to this date charged me. The red robin manager said wait 48hrs and should be fixed if not call him..You Can Bet I Will. Needless to say I won't be back to Red Robin for a while. If that location ever again."}
{"text":"To be honest, I am not a burger eater ... instead a grass eater (ppl called it salad sometime).  So I cannot really compare it to other sit-down burger place. 
But you know, once in a blue moon, you do crave for some grease and beefy meat patty ... hence, I landed in Red Robin. 

I must admit that this place is quite good. The burger actually tastes much better than what I remember from way back when I last ate one. Ordered the mushroom burger and the guacamole burger with bacon, with sweet potato fries (this is my weakness of all) and the onion rings.... ohh they are good.
Though the patty could be juicier, but I will say it definitely well worth the price and very good place for burger.  Guys/gals, forget about McBurger, and JackBurger ... this place is just couple dollars more but taste oh that much better.

Will go back when the blue moon come again :)"}
{"text":"Everything I need a great burger I go to red robin.

The staff at the Madison location are very friendly and they seem to work like a team.

I had the royal burger and it was awesome, hot and delicious. The fries that came out the waitress kept asking me if I wanted more fries, but I couldn't eat anymore.

You can pay quick and easy now on the ziosk things. Which was convenient."}
{"text":"I'm only leaving this review because this Red Robin finally seems to be getting its stuff together. As a longtime fan of their burgers, I was disappointed with this new location. The bar area was super small, such that you couldn't just walk up to it. You still had to ask to be seated...at the bar! Then when you were at the bar the staff would hover over you like hungry vulchers, asking how your food was with every bite. It was annoying and claustrophobic. Plus, the burgers just tasted differently than other locations.

Recently, I decided to give them another shot. The bar area was cleaned out and the burger actually tasted like a normal Red Robin burger. One (and only one) bartender waited on me and she was courteous but not a stalker. The bar area is still cramped and set up weird, with the beer taps blocking customers from handing the bartender anything and vice versa, but they seem to be getting the location together and living up to normal Red Robin standards."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. In short, it's am upscale burger place that has pretty decent customer service. The prices are a little high for burgers, but the food is good. I recommend this place if you are looking for something in-between a restaurant and a fast food joint. Additionally, the atmosphere is generally laid back regardless of the noise level."}
{"text":"Some of the staff were very nice and the food was okay. Not great but alright. I love that they give you the option to get a veggie burger in place of a meat patty.

I gave it 3 stars because our table was very sticky when we were seated. I asked our server for a wash cloth to wipe it again but they never brought one. I also watched a bus boy wipe a table next to us without any cleaning products. It made me wonder if they use anything but water on them. This is a huge deal, especially since I have children and cleanliness is kind of an important thing when we are eating out."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  This place used be an awesome place to take the kids.  They have rebranded this location, no more red robin walking around messing with kids, no more balloons, no more tv in the floor.  The menu is still good but the atmosphere had really changed.  We have a four year old who loved the balloons at the end of the meal and they no longer do that.  The service is okay, we will still go, just not as much fun for the kids.

From 2014

Update...

We went back and had horrible service, waited so long that the hostess ended up taking our drink and food order.  Waited about 7 to 10 more mins and the drinks never came out.  The managers walked by us multiple times but are too concerned with wiping already cleaned tables down to make eye contact with any customers.  The hostess seated another family and noticed our drinks and appetizer weren't out yet.  She went back and got them for us.  The waitress eventually showed up but never introduced herself to us.  I want sure she was a waitress until the second stop by.  I was surprised by the lack of service considering we were sitting at the tables right by the kitchen. ( the ones with the big red chairs)  In the end the hostess came back and checked in us, and apologized again for waiting so long.  When the waitress brought the check out she said the manager took half price off one burger because they messed up the order.  I ended up tipping the hostess more than our waitress because she was more helpful.  When we were leaving a we told the manager she was great and filled in because our waitress was absent most of the time.  He didn't acknowledge it, and seemed upset that I tipped the hostess.  Maybe if the managers spent more time managing and not wiping down tables that were already cleaned and trying to look busy, they would have better service.  After several negative trips to this location we have given up.  If the craving for red robin hits again, I'll make the drive to the Chandler location instead.  I will not step foot back in this location ever again."}
{"text":"I enjoy Red Robin. I really do. However, this isn't a location I can recommend. When we were being seated we were walked to a dirty table and told to wait while they wiped it down; not the most appetizing site prior to eating out. We sat down, ordered our drinks, and waited, and waited, and waited. When the drinks finally came we were very ready to order and quite hungry. My girlfriend and I got a burger to split, and she also got a side order of fruit. Then we waited some more. A lot more. After about 30 minutes (not an exaggeration) we finally were able to grab out waitress as she was passing by and we asked about our food order. She said \"It should be ready any minute now\". She then hurried back inside, grabbed our food and brought it out to us. The food was not hot. The food was not warm. It actually felt cold! I suspect it had been made in a timely manner and then was forgotten about. Now, I am not one to complain about food, I love food, but this was really frustrating. I asked the waitress if I could speak to the manager. He offered to bring us a fresh burger and fries and when he brought it out to us I very kindly told him what had happened and he apologized and offered to pay for our meal. The manager gets 5 stars, great guy, but the waitress really made what should have been an enjoyable outing quite frustrating. Other than that, the food at any other red robin is really great!"}
{"text":"The service was fine. Nothing stood out as overly good or overly bad. The food,though, was not good. For a restaurant burger joint, I was expecting so much more. The food was bland. I would much rather go to the other burger options in Downtown Summerlin and spend less money for a much better burger."}
{"text":"We've been eating at this location on and off for a number of  years and lately, it has been less and less often because of the problems with service. We ate here yesterday, ironically using a gift card given to us a few months back by the manager due to horrible service that time. It doesn't seem to be any one thing that goes wrong - there is a just a general sense of this restaurant never being organized. If the service is speedy, the kitchen is slow. If the kitchen is fast, the food runners let food sit in the window. Or some combo thereof. The food is decent for a chain burger joint and we like the flexibility of the veggie burgers since we don't eat meat. However, Red Robin isn't the only place we can get a veggie burger. I really wish this restaurant could get everything together!"}
{"text":"Poor service... Waited for a table for 15 minutes 
Hostess finally said there is bar service
Sat there 5 minutes 
Never ordered wasted 20 minutes 
Never again!"}
{"text":"Really not much of a review to leave walked in for seated right away. Sat at 6:10 pm at table 45. Sat there for 15 minutes and we were never spoken to once. While other tables were sat and helped. Party of 5 walked out because nobody even acknowledged us. I did let the hostess know. I can say it will be a very long time before I return to a place customers are not wanted."}
{"text":"My first and last visit was today! After a movie I thought I try Red Robin. I ordered a \" pink\" burger\" (medium rare) of one of the premiere burgers. It came, the bartender asked me how it was.  I said \"well done, for a pink burger\". He asked to look, said yes that's not even pink! Manager came over to see it, \" I heard your burger was over cooked\" he looked, said yeah that's not right. Walked away!
No offer of discount or no charge.
Burger was dripping grease, Fry's were dry.
I won't be rushing back......"}
{"text":"My visit to this location started off quite mediocre. And then it went downhill from there. When we got our drinks, the server set them on our table and immediately walked away to another table where she proceeded to provide better service and did so with a much more pleasant attitude. 

Other than the server being too rushed to even appear as if she was concerned with our table, the fact that we had to wait nearly 20 minutes to even get a chance to tell her one of our burgers was subpar was equally frustrating. We sat patiently waiting as our server hastily helped other tables and saw to their needs while being quite effectively ignored until the very moment I was getting up to go find a manager. As if her vision was based on movement or something. 

As soon as our server realized we had a complaint, her ability to provide quick & effective service showed up. Weird. 

We got the rest of order to go, and our server was more than happy to rush our food out to us. 

With the wrong cheese on the burger. 

Probably a little too rushed to get our food to us. 


The food was good. It always is. And in the end, the server did take the second burger off of our check without us even asking. But being ignored so thoroughly until the possibility of a complaint to the manager was sensed, and then providing the service other patrons were receiving is a bit backwards."}
{"text":"Very burnt burger. Not even edible. Don't know how a chef could serve that to a guest. Server has been great though.

Adding to my post above. I got a replacement burger to go, as we have already spent 30 mins waiting for the first burgers. This one was also burnt. What a sad excuse for a burger joint. I would recommend the corporation of red robin to close this location down to save its brand. I highly recommend not going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Greeted at the door with smiles, courteous and friendly! Great customer service and management !"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my sister and her kids on a Friday at about 1 pm. The place was busy but not packed. We had to wait a little in the front to be recognized,  but not too long to be annoyed. After being seating we were attentively greeted by our server. I ordered the whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap which comes with bottomless fries. I noticed they now had the choice for bottomless sweet potato fries and asked for those.  The food didn't take long to get. I immediately noticed that the wrap was extremely small for being $10, but figured I wouldn't eat it all anyways so I wouldn't fuss about it. After one bite I knew I couldn't eat the rest of it. The wrap was so small but they used a larger (perhaps burrito sized) tortilla and wrapped and folded and contorted it so my first bite was mostly chewy tortilla with a little filling. I looked through the rest of the wrap where I took that bite and saw that it was nothing but tortilla all the way down the side. All they had to do was fill up the space with lettuce for goodness sake! There was barely any lettuce. That's just being cheap. So, I flagged the server down and explained to her that I don't normally ask to switch my food but the wrap just too chewy and asked her to switch it for the whiskey river BBQ chicken sandwich.  She did and the sandwich came out shortly later. Much better. When we got the bill, we found out the sweet potato fries were an up charge of $1.50. I don't mind paying for better things but I wish the server would have advised me when I ordered them. Of course the chicken sandwich was more expensive by a few dollars too, but I kind of figured it would be. My server was very good and the replacement food was brought out by the manager I think. Thought he did not state so himself. I will come back to red Robin because they took care of the problem effectively,  but I will never get a wrap from them again."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Red Robin in years because of past bad experiences.  Today's visit started off with smiles from the hostess to the very helpful and professional waitress.  She was well informed and made us smile with her food suggestions. The food arrived and my wife ordered her burger well done, and thats how it arrived. Unfortunately my burger was to be medium rare and was delivered well done. Our server came back to table and I showed her the burger was gray and well done. She apologized and took it back to kitchen for a re-order. I ate my fries while I waited and they brought me another order of fries until the burger arrived. At this time I had a supervisor come to the table and apologize for the burger. She even said that the GM was making my burger. My burger arrived and it met my expectations. The GM came over to see if everything was ok. That was very nice. The only other problem I had was that I filled-up on the fries and couldn't finish my burger. At $14 something a burger I have to say I was disappointed.  The server was very good and the management apologized."}
{"text":"Horrible service, this girl had such a snobby attitude! BrandiLynn or something like that"}
{"text":"Terrible service took an hour to get a water when it wasn't busy waitress just stood around talking to friends"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this red robin on a Friday evening. It was very busy but we were quickly seated. We knew what we wanted to order. Our waiter seemed disappointed when we didn't want alcoholic drinks or an appetizer. After our burgers came he treated us as almost an afterthought. He acted like it was a hassle to bring us some more \"bottomless\" fries. And I was never even offered a refill on my coke. I noticed he gave much better service to a family of 4 across the way. I guess in order to get good service, you need to come in with a large party or have kids."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Food was wonderful and the service was excellent. Not to mention, the server that helped me was HOT!!! Thanks Matt D."}
{"text":"The food here is exceptional. The servers are sweet, fast, ahead of the game, and very funny. I love the bottomless lemonade, the boneless wings, and the burger quality is amazing. The menus are very detailed and capture your attention with their descriptions. I am definitely coming back. This place deserves better reviews."}
{"text":"My daughter and I are a fan of this place. I usually get their Bacon Cheeseburger and she gets the Arctic Cod fish and chips meal. They come with unlmited fries, but you usually will not get to the second servings of fries.

We also love their strawberry lemonades. Its unlimited refills and they have sweet strawberries in their lemonades.

The food is good, service is good and overall its a great place to go every other 2-3 months."}
{"text":"We took the kids here on Friday to celebrate both our graduation. It was a big disappointment and I had to write a review before I forget!! Service was horrible, they were not busy at all, but it took us 45 minutes to get our food. Our waiter was not friendly at all and didn't care about us at all. We watch other servers tend to their customers quickly while ours didn't. I would see her trying to blame other people for the poor service to her other tables. We were there for over two hours which is ridiculous for this type of restaurant. When we left my husband told the manager their service was horrible...his only response was \"what really??\" No, apologies whatsoever.

Also we love the strawberry freckle lemonade. However, the one here taste like cold water on ice only! We won't be going back to this location EVER!"}
{"text":"Very nice selection of burgers, always cooked very nicely. The bottomless fries are great as well. They also have great drinks, such as strawberry lemonade with real berries, and also free refills!!

The service is pretty good, but during slower times can be spotty."}
{"text":"If you like ear-splitting noise from screaming kids and weak drinks, Red Robin is for you."}
{"text":"Ate here as a party of eight (five kids and three adults). Great service; food was what we expected."}
{"text":"Not worth the bother. I had a hankering for a veggie burger that I didn't want to cook. I'm vegan but not in people's faces about it. I can't eat dairy, but eggs and meat are my choice. Anyway I combed the website to make sure about what to order to go so I don't drive them crazy. They were really helpful on the phone and I told them exactly to the T, just a vegan boca burger without dijon or red robin seasoning, how the website said it. I had to take it back because it was obviously a garden burger (cheese) with some cream sauce on it. Had to wait another 10 mins, looked good so left. It sucks they don't offer any condiments for their boca burger and even the sweet potato fries didn't come with the sweet sour sauce they say it does... Top it all off with, I got through almost the whole burger (with my own condiments) the whole last half edge of the thing was so freezer dehydrated, I couldn't bite into it. I just hope it was stored properly so I don't get sick. So I wouldn't recommend this place to any vegans or especially someone with allergies, sorry but they're kind of ditzy about this."}
{"text":"Stopped to place to go order at 9:00 on a Saturday night. Bartender & other servers busy counting their tickets & tips. BT asked what we needed and we said order to go then she went back to various duties. Gave us no menus. Service 101 item there. Several minutes later asked what our order was and finally gave menus. Staff more concerned with counting money than basic service steps. This is LAST of MANY long ticket times and waiting for us at this RR location. We walked out and went across to Applebee's. Bartender there was fully engaged in serving customers."}
{"text":"My two family members got food poisoning from your veggie burger. We used to go to your restraunt all the time, but after this incidence we do not!"}
{"text":"Ordered online for pick up so tip was added before pick up. $105 order with $10 tip. When picking up the food, the server went through bag and \"checked off\" everything on our order. Drove 20 minutes home to find out that they forgot an entree. Called to speak to someone about it and was put on hold for 10 minutes only to be hung up on. This isn't the first time they have forgotten something that they \"checked off\". It's ridiculous and to be hung up on after that long of a hold is infuriating. I will be calling tomorrow to have a refund applied to my card for at very least the entree and tip. Hopefully I'm not hung up on again and so I'm not forced to go down there to deal with this crap."}
{"text":"The manager of this restaurant went above and beyond to assist our family. The staff was very friendly and prompt with our needs even during a peak time of day. I signed up for yelp just to write a great review for this business. Our whole family loves their food and I am so pleased with the way they handled a tough situation (my family lol) and the overall experience."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm writing a review for Red Robin. I only say this because it's a chain restaurant and I've frequented so many mom and pops. But Red Robin (this one at least) deserves a shout out! Let me just start by saying that I don't frequent Red Robin so this may just be the honeymoon phase, lol. However, the honeymoon is going very, very well. They have some amazingly delicious and juicy burgers. I got the 'Royal Red Robin' as I've never had egg on a burger before. I will never be the same again! The second time we went (the very same week), I got the Whiskey River Bbq chx. Again, just as good as the burger. I now own a loyalty card and will be returning to this chain again. www.rvlostyet.com"}
{"text":"I absolutely love red robin at other locations but this particular location I have had multiple problems with including having cold fries multiple times over, the meat smelled foul and was over cooked until stiff. Along with the poor food, the table we sat at had food all over from the previous customers and the booth was sticky."}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot, and yesterday I picked Red Robin since we haven't been here in a while and it was my Father's Day dinner selection.  The service was absolutely pathetic.  Had to remind my server several times for refills, food that was cold and boxes for our food.

At first I thought we were in for a good meal with a good server at the start, but it turned horribly wrong.  We ordered the large stack of onion rings, got the small stack.  My wife had sweet potato fries that were cold and took forever to get her new fries.  The server wasn't gracious at all, and when the fries did come out he just handed them to my wife with no apologies.  He came to say he would refill our drinks and it took a reminder and 15 minutes before we got them.  At the end of the meal he promised boxes for our leftover food, took him 20 minutes to get our boxes.  He made an excuse of getting food for another table, well that is not our problem.

Saw a person who was cleaning a table with a dirty dish rag, makes me wonder on how clean this establishment is, etc.

Not sure if I will ever return to Red Robin any time soon.   Shame."}
{"text":"So it been over a year since my last review of this place. We were greeted promptly and sat down. Great start!  Ordered our food and service. Had a good feeling service was going to be good, we joked with the server. He joked with the family how many orders of fries my son was going to eat. He walked by the table a few times and said ok for everything we asked for refills. Had to ask the other server for refills. 

I'm driving to another location for now on. Management needs to step it up before the doors close for good."}
{"text":"Lela the server was awesome!!!!! ... we came in for my 4 yr olds bday with 2 other kids helped got us all set up and even brought us fries to occupy them while we waited for the rest of her food ... she was on top of every refill ! And was nice and accommodating the whole visit ... we come here often ... and will definitely keep our eye out to sit in her section next time !!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to happy with them the last two times in, gave it a second chance as anyone can have a bad day but two was a little much for me.Burger was over cooked and dry both times. Better luck down the street at In and Out Burger."}
{"text":"Best burgers I have tasted in a while... The onion rings were good... The food is pricey but well worth it... Good customer service"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Very clean. A bit quiet at 13:00."}
{"text":"Thus is my second time with this complaint and now I'm insensed.
First time called in order to take out and when I got home mussing items. 1 entree and all condiments. No dressing for salad, no ketchup etc. Called and they said I could stop by. I am 7 miles away so that wouldn't work. Just yesterday, we decided to order out again. This time my husband actually went down to restaurant and order in person. After getting home AGAIN
to find another missing entrée!!! It certainly isn't our responsibility to go over every item!!! When I called and when it really made me angry. The manager said they don't have a delivery service so I can either come back and get the entree or he could credit me. No I'm sorry nothing ridiculous. The worst customer service ever we will never patronize this place again"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst!  I'm not sure how, but after their remodel this place went south!  HORRIBLE service, late food delivery, incorrect orders and crappy food.

We visited last night (for the last time) and were seated quickly although it was busy.  Waited quite a while before our drink order was taken and waited even longer to receive the drinks and place our order.  My order was wrong and my salad arrived with no dressing.  Couldn't find a server to flag down to correct the order and then waited long enough for my husband to finish his meal before my correct order arrived.  No apologies from the server.  I noticed the guests dining behind us were also experiencing similar issues, and so I'm guessing our server was having an off-night.  But this is the second visit we've had (different servers) with the same complaints.

There definitely needed to be some retaining with that remodel!"}
{"text":"The food was below average and I feel as though the portion sizes have gotten much smaller! Our waiter took forever and barely helped us! The appetizers were great but other than that not much to look forward to. Above all I was disappointed with the meal and over all experience"}
{"text":"If you enjoy a great salad of generous portion, Red Robin is for you.  Fresh, crispy and delicious.  Burgers are just par and a little pricey, but the salads are top notch."}
{"text":"Was at red robin on 01/10/2015. And have to say wow Shannon and his trainee ryan were great. Shannon is doing a great job cant wait to come back to see these guys will ask for them"}
{"text":"I eat at this location probably once a week and have for quite some time. The staff at this location are excellent. They are always so mindful of your time, especially around lunchtime when I don't have all day to sit and wait. The food is always fresh, hot, and delicious and the restaurant is very clean. I have used them several times for catering purposes and while I am bummed they don't deliver, it is always great to know that my large orders will be ready on time when I show up to pick them up. This is my favorite location by far!"}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing birthday dinner for our daughter. Not the waiters fault but way under staffed and too many tables per waiter and waitresses."}
{"text":"Red Robin was pretty good.  My husband had the hamburger and fries.  He liked both.  Not so many fries, which was nice for a change and they asked if he wanted more when he had finished them.  Usually you get so many you can't (or shouldn't) eat half of them.  I had tortilla soup and salad.  Both were pretty ordinary.  We enjoyed the fact there weren't a lot of people there so we were seated and served quickly.  Just a nice lunch all the way around."}
{"text":"My wife and I have probably visited this red robin no less than 20 times in the last year. This time was quit different than we have had in the past. I ordered my usual bacon and cheese hamburger, wife grilled chicken sandwich. Both with bottomless fries. The food tasted a little different and my wife remarked it to the server, we didn't think anything of it till later in the evening it was apparent we were both sick. It hit me at 4:00am the next day. It's been 24hours and I'm finally better. This was the only meal I have had and followed with a 102 temp. It could have been a fluke coincidence, but the 102 temp for a day doesn't seem like it. We were there on Friday about 8:30-8:45. They get 2 stars because they kept up on refills."}
{"text":"The quality of this place has gone done. For a chain restaurant, I used to like their salads and burgers. Last night I ordered the cobb chicken salad, the chicken was not good, horrible quality, and the bacon on the salad was disgusting, undercooked and chewy. The food took forever to come out, and the Mac and cheese was cold. I'll never dine there again. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Shayenne is the best.. She always hooks up my fries real quick."}
{"text":"I came in last Sunday with a group of co-workers because we were celebrating the end of the season at the local water park. There were 15 of us, and we were loud and rambunctious -- everything you'd expect from a handful of teenagers -- but our server was great and took really good care of us all.

I ordered one of my all-time favorites, the bacon cheeseburger. Everyone's food took quite a long time to cook (such is to be expected), but OMG, it was so worth the wait! It was just what I needed after a long day. Everyone else had an equally outstanding eating experience, and after eating and paying our individual bills, we all took pictures, shared many laughs, and reminisced on the past season.

It was a fantastic end to a bittersweet night. I'm no stranger to Red Robin, and I'm gonna be honest, they never disappoint...big groups are what they do best. I will keep coming until I physically can't anymore!"}
{"text":"Always great service. Great food. It's a chain but they do it right. You will not be disappointed. If you are it's your fault."}
{"text":"Couldn't stay to order once we saw the cook in the kitchen - his jeans were so low, his bright grren underwear were in full view.  One of the last things I want a cook to do is constantly pull up his pants.  Keep your hands out of your pants, chef."}
{"text":"Burgers were great, you get free refils on fries.   Waiter was very friendly.   Only negative I could say is I ordered \"some pink\" on my burger and it came out medium to medium well."}
{"text":"Awesome service by Sara! She's on top of it today. The place was jam-packed & still managed to take great care of us & promptly get everything we needed. Food (as always) was delicious. I highly recommend their Bonsai burger, been getting it for years & never gets old."}
{"text":"I would have to say that my experiences at this location has declined as the years have gone on. When they first opened it was great and as time has gone on, it's gotten worse. The table was dirty, the seats were wet from spilled drinks, and the floor was filthy under the booth we were seated at. The host made a poor attempt to clean it up. My husband found apples in his salad that wasn't supposed to have apples in it. Our table was hardly cleared of empty dishes. We had no silverware until we asked for them after we received our food.  The food was good though. But the service was poor. Unfortunately we won't be returning to this Red Robin in the future."}
{"text":"Service was good but for a burger joint they can't cook a burger.  We both ordered med rare and there was no pink to be found on the entire table. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Your burger and beer kinda place. Food is great , you can't go wrong with black & blu burger + sides. 

Staff is great, seating capacity is crazy. They got a plus 21 seatings and regular seatings for family . Parking is nothing to worry about. I am not sure about patio seating. 

Overall good restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible chain burger restaurant. Service is spotty and I completely disagree with the other comments that the burgers are good. I have been forced to eat here for work several times. It is not a good option considering the many good options in Pittsburgh for burgers."}
{"text":"I just recently went to Red Robin for lunch and it really wasn't too shabby.
 
I ordered a California Chicken Sandwich and was quite pleased. I was able to modify my sandwich to my picky pleasure and ended up enjoying my new found, bun covered gold.

Also, I appreciate their bottomless fries. (I call them buttless fries) Butt, either way, I like this little feature of starting off with a fresh batch of French fries rather than the popular bread introduction. 

I'm not constantly craving Red Robin, but I've decided that they were certainly my friend."}
{"text":"Don't go hungry. Server lost our order and weren't notified until 30mins later after watching other customers, whom arrived after us, received their food before us. Never got our food. Walked outta that rig like a boss. A hungry boss."}
{"text":"I am disappointed at this location.  Service meets standards, but the food was disgusting, my sweet potato fries were burned, the burger was cold and the milkshakes tasted horrible! I think this time will be my last at this location."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. We frequented  this restaurant a lot with a 9 yr old and now 7 yr old. We went specifically to have a birthday dinner. Had to  remind the server twice and while people sang Happy Birthday all around us to adults, nobody came for my little girl. It essentially ruined her night as she kept asking why they wouldn't sing to her. We left before I lost my cool. I guess being kind to a little girl was too much to ask for this establishment. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Location is nice made some recent changes to the inside and front of restaurant. They were a little slow with getting my order out but the staff is friendly and was great with my kid."}
{"text":"I grew up in Seattle, so I am very familiar with Red Robin restaurants. This location is NOTHING like I know of the Red Robin Brand. If my only experience with Red Robin was this location I would be wondering how they stay in business. I have given this location multiple chances with each experience worse than the last one. I walk in or call each time with an open mind and a hopefulness that things will go well. But food Is wrong, people hang up on you while you're talking or you just sit there without acknowledgement. To be quick I will summarize just the last 4 visits.

1. Dine in- Order wrong. If you have food allergies and you mention it to the server expect them to forget or the kitchen not seem to care... Even though they have a separate offerings like Gluten free buns.

2. Phone in- order wrong. Wife and I wanted a laid back family night so I called in the order. Reiterated the gluten free bun. The order was repeated back to me. Wife picked it up and reiterated the gluten free, the take-out waitress confirmed yes it has the gluten free bun. Got it home and it was not. We had ordered for the family so she didn't really want to empty everything out right there. And the additional charge WAS on the receipt so the waitress at least had it right.

3. Phone in- rude. Decided to try it again.... Called in asked if they still had gluten free buns. They did. Ordered the rest. Waitress said ok. I started asking how long that would be to come get it and how much. About 4 words into it she cut me off, said ok see you in a bit and hung up... Figured she was busy so I didn't bother her again at all...

4. Dine in- ignored. My son and I went bowling today and we decided to get some lunch afterwards. I know, why would I try again, I try to give some benefit of the doubt and figured middle of the afternoon for a late lunch should be fine. We walked in, hostess was nice, seated us quickly didn't look very busy. That's pretty much where the hospitality ended. We sat for little over 10mins without anyone acknowledging us (at this point I wanted to see if anyone would without me waving my hands around like I was waving down the beer guy at a baseball game). A couple came in at this point with their toddler and infant so I decided to see how their service went.... Oh they had their drinks from the bar, water, and drink for the toddler before they even finished getting the car seat with the infant settled in. Needless to say we left at this point and went for some sandwiches across the parking lot.

But looks like a few people had some good experiences here. As for the remodel it looks nice but ask for a booth if you go because they cram some of those tables in there. Although I guess it's good if you are interested in what your table neighbors are whispering... On second thought it's so loud you can hardly hear your own table sometimes so it doesn't really matter.

Ask for fries ahead of your meal if your hungry. Gotta appreciate the bottomless steak fries.

Maybe in a few months I will give it another shot.... I apparently enjoy frustrating myself"}
{"text":"I have dined at this location many times and am so grateful for their service and attention to gluten-free dietary restrictions.   In addition to gluten-free options, they claim to have a separate fryer for the fries - so that fries are not contaminated by flour-encrusted items.  

Thanks, Red Robin Glendale!"}
{"text":"Had out of state family in & they were on central time & very hungry.  We were told 15 MIN and it was almost 1hr. Had to ask for crackers while the food was fixed to pacify the baby. Food was great, just bad timing on our part and bad estimation their part. Will return obviously"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Drink seemed a bit watered down and chips with guacamole was a small portion. But it's all about the burgers and they were great! Great service as well including a nice visit from the manager. And bottomless rootbeer floats is mind blowing!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I had the RUDEST waiter ever there!! Travis was my waiter! I came to red robins for a good burger and my endless fries!! My boyfriend asked for fries he had an attitude like it came out of his check or something he comes back with the fries and say ' here you go big guy ' how rude!!! ALSO my boyfriend ordered water and drunk it quick ( they filled the glass with ice) and Travis comes back and says I quote ' damnnn thristy as fuck ' LIKE WHAT !! We are not friends and that was rude! So whatever while we're eating he brings me the check then I'm on the phone and he comes back asking for the $$!!! Like what just because we're both young doesnt mean I should get rude service !!  I regert not telling the manager cause he was rude!!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty and poor service. Everything felt dirty. Even the advertisements on the table had crusty food on it. The waiter wasn't attentive at all. Our order was messed up and he blamed us! When we paid it took him 20 minutes to return with our change. Stay away !"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my daughter. I had the BLTA Croissant which was very tasty. My daughter had the kids pizza with broccoli and a  chocolate shake. The waiter was nice and the food came out fast. My daughter being the picky eater she is asked why the pepperoni on her pizza was not shaped like a smiley face like the one on the menu. She also asked for sprinkles in her milk shake because the one on the menu had some."}
{"text":"I was there on a Sunday afternoon when it was dead and the service was horrible. After receiving my food I had to wait 10 minutes for silverware while my food got cold all the while watching the wait staff stand around and do nothing. Instead of tending to my table my server was behind the bar making drinks. Managers were walking around but not one stopped at my table."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited here for lunch today.  We sat in a booth, in the bar area. Someone from the bar came to clean our table and told us the waitress would be by in a few minutes.  She came to take our drink order , 1 diet, 1 ice tea.  Three other tables were filled after we arrived.  Our drinks were filled and then our order was taken.  We waited, and waited, and waited for our food.  My husband finished his drink.  The waitress came by.  We asked her about our food.  She told us the kitchen fell behind with the mad rush of lunch guests.  When the waitress returned with a refill of ice tea, my husband pointed out that one other guest who arrived after us were already eating.  She tried to apologize and said the manager was already aware and would comp our lunch, and/or would also come over to speak to us.  The manager Mario came over and told us our ticket was \"lost\" and they were working on our order, there were no excuses, and he would comp our lunch.  So we sit there waiting patiently, by then the other 3 tables were eating.  Really, I felt like crying.  I'm sure about 45 minutes went by before we got our food.  I got my bowl of lettuce, which was supposed to be a caesar salad w/o any dressing.  I waited, and waited for our waitress to ask for dressing.  When she returned to our table, any good waitress would see an empty glass and take it with her to refill, she leaves to get the dressing, returns, and leaves again, without asking to refill the ice tea.
You see Mario, I don't think it's the fact that someone in the kitchen lost the ticket to our food.  I believe your waitress needs some training.  I think she forgot to put in our ticket and that was the delay of our food, plus she's not attentive to customers as a good waitress should be.  I worked in the restaurant business so I know how things work.  
We should have just paid for our drinks like we wanted and went somewhere where there's good service.  Sorry Red Robin..........not this time.  
My husband and I each have a Red Robin Royalty account and have had it for years.  We often place orders by phone and pick up here.  It will be a long time before we visit this establishment again.   
A relative told me the Red Robin where they live has kind of gone down hill so they don't go there anymore.  Sounds like Red Robin needs to Straighten Up and Fly Right!"}
{"text":"Ordered a gourmet burger because of the endless steak fries.  The burger was tasty (BBQ) but the steak fries were delicious!  We told our server we were trying to eat before a movie, and she said she would put a rush on our order.  It came out very quick, and so did our refills for the fries."}
{"text":"Went tonight towards the end of the night and was disappointed with food. Kitchen and bathrooms were dirty.  Lately it seems a lack of good service and cleanliness is an issue."}
{"text":"We just dined recently at this Red Robin's location and the food wasn't that great. Lets start of with the appetizer, chicken tender Banzai- the chicken pieces were over fried. My husband ordered the whiskey river bbq burger and he took one bite and had to stop eating right away. He bit into the burger and he tasted a chunk of salt on his burger. The burger was not seasoned evenly. He barely had a bite of his burger. The manager did come and try to have him order something else. Although, the burger left such a bad taste in his mouth that he didn't want to try anything else. Overall, the food was just okay. Hopefully  they start taking their time and seasoning the burgers correctly."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! Love the wiskey river burger! They recently revamped the kids menu with tons of options. My youngest is super picky, she found something to order and actually ate it. We usually order from the regular menu for the older one, but he new kids menu has something for the bigger kids too."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of yummy, juicy, unhealthy burger, then this is the place to go!

My favorite is the A1 Peppercorn burger. The patty is made to your liking (I like mine Medium). When you bite into the burger, you bite into a little bit of heaven. Make sure to add their \"secret\" Red Robin spice to the burger, it totally enhances the flavor. Although this gourmet burger place is a \"chain\", it definitely doesn't feel like a chain quality.

Along with their burgers, they offer free bottomless steak fries. They are fried to perfection and will fill you up quick.

Average price is about $8-10 for the burgers, but it includes the unlimited fries, so it's a pretty decent deal. Definitely bang for your buck if you come here.

Be sure to sign up for their e-club too as you get a free meal on your birthday!"}
{"text":"I have had great meals at Red Robins, but my experience at this location was awful. We chose to go to Red Robin because of the \"bottomless fries,\" but when the food finally came (After 10 minutes waiting for our server to acknowledge us, and 40 more minutes waiting for our meal to come), the fries were cold. They weren't lukewarm, they were cold. This is after we specifically requested that they bring us the fries before the meal. Our waiter said that their policy is for fries to go with appetizers first and then, if there are any extra, they can offer refills or pre-fills.  By the time I got a decent order of fries, I had literally been in my seat for over an hour. They claim to have bottomless fries, but when the place is busy, fries are so scarce, you're lucky if you get more than a handful with your burger. I'm usually not one to complain, but this location has lost my business. In the future I'll either consider going to the location on Stapley and US60, or I'll find a Smash Burger."}
{"text":"My wife and I decide to eat here our last night in the Phoenix area.  We got seated immediately. The hostess was nice but seemed rushed for how slow they were. The food I believe at most red robin locations is pretty good. But here it was so so. The fries were cold, and the hamburger was as well but still tasted ok. Our server though was great. His name was dave. He was real and down to earth with us."}
{"text":"Horrible service & The garlic fries which I used to love taste like garbage. The old recipe used to have olive oil, parmesan cheese, and garlic pieces. Now they just throw some garlic powder and parsley on them. Not worth the extra $1."}
{"text":"It was a very bad experience for my date and I at this restaurant which is unusual for the red robin restaurants. The service was awful and the food was ok though they didn't get it right the first time and we had to send it back. The drinks took forever as well

I know they were busy but they just seemed either unprepared or just overwhelmed. I hope it was just my experience at this store but if this place is busy I wouldn't go to it again that's for sure"}
{"text":"Really bland tasting food, and annoying atmosphere, as well as annoying staff. The food has nothing unique about it. I wish the fries were good so \"bottomless fries\" meant something to me. The table we sat at was REALLY close to another table (there is a row of crammed tables) and the people next to us were eavesdropping the entire time. Quite uncomfortable, but the only seating available. They brought out an entirely wrong burger to me, but gave me a $20 giftcard since they messed up, so that was cool."}
{"text":"There was a 10-15 minute wait when we got there if we didn't want to eat in the bar so we chose the bar.  When walking thru the restaurant there were several empty tables that hadn't been cleaned off.  When my husband went to the restroom there was grease on the floor on the way and he almost slipped.  Our waitress was not very friendly and didn't say much and instead just stood by our table looking at us.  When she did speak she mumbled and was hard to hear.  We ordered the soft pretzels to start which took awhile to come out and then had a funny taste to them.  Our food took awhile to come out as well.  I had the new Smoke & Pepper burger.  The lettuce on the burger tasted like it wasn't washed and the fries were cold.  I ordered the herb garlic fries which were not worth the money.  My husband ordered the onion rings and they were falling apart in his hand, to the point where he couldn't dip them in any sauce.  Our waitress didn't come back to the table to see how the food was and our water glasses sat empty for awhile.  Once we had paid the bill I went to the restroom and  discovered someone had SHIT ON THE FLOOR of one of the stalls.  Never again will I return to this establishment!"}
{"text":"Yum.  Tony  was an awesome  server, even with how many tables he had. And food and drinks were delicious as usual. And can't beat the great prices!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the service was great! Ilene was our waitress and she is amazing!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We came in and was assigned a table .  15 minutes later, no one bothered to serve us (not even a drink to start with). They seemed way too busy.  Two waiters walked past us, looking at our table and just walked away as if they were too busy taking care of others.  We walked out, telling them we waited too long; they said sorry but it was too late!  Too crowded; long wait; unfriendly (stressed out) waiters ; we feel sorry for them!  Chick fil a is  healthier with much friendlier service!"}
{"text":"Red robin... umm... Seriously the worst service I have ever received in any restaurant in my whole entire life. \"Blue jay\" the rudest manager ever in the bluest shirt I have ever seen, charged us 2.19 for \"bottomless fries\" after already purchasing bottomless fries. We didn't even eat them and when we asked her to return them she did this weird thing with her mouth and didn't give an answer. Our waiter kept rubbing her stomach like it was a genie bottle, I felt like I was on the Aladdin ride at Disneyland. Such terrible service and this is from a restaurant worker myself."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this red robin!!! Compared to the nasty one on Bullard, coming here is like heaven!!! Our waitress, who we request every time, has to give the best service out of almost every restaurant I've ever been too!!!!! Martiqua is an absolute delite and can take care of her customers!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good burger for a chain restaurant. My husband loves the unlimited fries but they always make his burger wrong or mess up his bun. I really love the new appetizers they have. The mini wedge salad is delicious. If you are at a spring training game they are located right across from the ballpark."}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken burger...... A MUST TRY!!! Our server Michael was the best!! My daughter loved her birthday dinner, thank you Red Robin.  We're very much appreciative....."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum yuum.I love the fries. Today I tried the black and bleu burger, it was fantastic. I was shuttle disappointed because they ran out of soft serve soI couldn't get a shake, but other than that our waitress was very attentive to us and our food was brought to out table hot. Had a great experience."}
{"text":"Ah yes.  My first Red Robin Gourmet Burger.  Solo lunch on a Friday.

I ordered the Bacon Avacado burger, bunless with steamed broccoli on the side.  My anticipation growing.

First bite, dry, well done.  I thought I ordered \"as rare as possible\".  Avacado?  Nope.  Some tasteless guacamole that likely came from a can.  At least the bacon was good......but $12 for this?

First impression was not good.  I've been told its good, maybe they will get a second chance."}
{"text":"Getting better. They're giving me fries to take home...that's cool. I'm no longer on hold for 20 to 30 minutes. Awesome. Now if only they can get the orders right. There was one girl who caught and corrected my order. I always ask for extra fries and I'm normally charged for it. However when i have to wait another 20 minutes for the extra order of fries I'm paying for, my food gets cold.... but great improvement!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch today and was served by kori (sorry if mispelled). I was engaged in conversation with a friend and my kid for the most of our lunch but did take notice that kori did an exceptional job of refilling our drinks our bottomless fries and accommodating us. Didn't get to say thank you on the way out but will definitely go back and request her section."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened here.  I use to enjoy eating here when I lived in Charlotte.  We were passing through so we picked up an order to go.  The order was wrong and we paid for things we did not get.  The food was good.  When the credit card charge hit, it was for $2 more.  I guess they wanted more tip on top of the cash tip we left.  I have contacted corporate three times and the restaurant twice.  After 2 weeks the refund finally was received."}
{"text":"wonderful place and yummy food!"}
{"text":"Golly!  I expected to see the ratings of Red Robin to be a little higher than a 3-star average.  This used to be my spot.  Bottomless fries, Bonzai Burger, fun atmosphere...  But we stopped going as frequently a few years ago because they seemed to be slacking.  Or maybe other burger joints just got better?

Anyway, we went to this location 2 nights ago.  Fries were still good.  But they seemed to come out slower and in less quantity that I had recalled from my youth.  Also, the burgers seemed to be smaller and of inferior quality than I remember.  Balloons are no longer filled with helium.  Instead, you get balloons that are attached at the end of plastic sticks.  

To me, it seems as if the bean counters got too much influence over the folks in charge of product quality.  We could be witnessing a slow death...  Mr. Red Robbin Chairman, please take this company back from the cost-cutters.  You cannot shrink your way to growth.

I might go back again some time.  But it will not be soon and it will not be frequent.  There are too many good options out there now."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently went to eat at Red Robin.  We asked the host if we could have a booth, she said one moment so I can get the Busser to clean it off.  Well she ended cleaning it herself, we tried to tip her but she said that is was her pleasure and not to worry about it, and she will be upfront if we need absolutely anything else.  She was very personable while seating us.  The burgers were delicious, as usual.  On our way out, one of the managers was upfront calling the two hosts stupid, that's all I heard and that made me upset. The hostess name was Ashley, I will be coming back because of her and the awesome food.  The 5 stars goes to her.  I can tell she really cares about her job and her guests.   As for the manager, I'm not sure what his name is, but him calling the hosts stupid is unnecessary and unprofessional.  Actually I believe his name is Bryan, or Ryan.  Bryan or Ryan has ZERO stars, he should not be talking to his employees like that.   It is very disrespecting.  

All in all the service was awesome,  our server Ben was great, we never had him as a server before but he did an awesome job."}
{"text":"No wait to be seated. But my family and I sat there for 22mins and NO ONE took our drink order or even bothered to introduce themselves as our waiter We will not be going back to this Red Robins."}
{"text":"This place is a miss most of the time. In the past the food was good but last night it all was just plain bad. Bad customer service, dirty table/booth and the restroom was worse than a truckstop.  The fries were bottomless but also old and dry. Stay away!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was seated right away. Then 15 minutes later I still hadn't seen a server. We left, guess they didn't want our business. Will not be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"I have to say that I\"m lovin' this place!  Part of the reason we like it so much is because of two servers, Ashley and Tim.  They are the best and make every dinning experience great.  The onion rings are good and the dipping sauce is really good. I always get the Bonsai Burger and it's been good every time."}
{"text":"Dakota (he's a guy) was awesome! My nephew and I were waited on immediately upon sitting down (after a brief 10 min wait for a table). Our food was brought out promptly AND my fries were fresh and hot! The manager greeted us after our meal to ensure all was well. My Thorny Señorita Rita was GRRREEATT as well. 

No complaints from this girl about this place."}
{"text":"It's Red Robin and I like it.  Great for kids. Always feels clean. Quality has always been good.  I always get my fries first with ranch, a trick I picked up from a friend.

The service is consistently slow, while they seat your relatively quick it still takes a while to get  your grub on."}
{"text":"Yeah its lunch time and I am on the go.  What better place to pick up lunch but Red Robin Gourmet Burgers,  Well that is how excited I was knowing in my mind this would hit the spot. Ordered the Grilled Chicken salad avocado and my taste buds are dancing. So why not treat myself to something sweet ( Cheesecake strawberries) happy dance :)  Open my salad and the first thought was you have got to be kidding me.  Wilted lettuce, over ripped tomato, uncooked chicken with water down dressing.  Why would you allow this to leave your store and served to faithful customers. For the price I could have bought to Great tasting salads from Chick fil A but Noooooo I wanted the Big Red. Bigger Mistake !!! Just to make it worst I decided to eat the Cheesecake and guess what ?  Whoever cut the slice must have just chopped onions cause that is all I taste.  Simple things make greater impacts on your customers.  Take pride in your service as I take pride in coming to be served the best you have to offer."}
{"text":"I ordered my Bleu cheese burger medium. It was way overdone, dry & chewy. The flavor was ok, but nothing great. The tomatoes were half green & mealy. I sat in the bar are for a late lunch. The older bartender was nice enough, but he never came back to check on me once the food was delivered. He did bring me another iced tea after awhile. I was definitely not impressed. At least the steak fries were good."}
{"text":"I will probably never go to Red Robin again. I was hesitant to go here again. But I'm gluten free right now and I've heard good things about them being very great with cross contamination. Well I ended up ordering a grilled chicken sandwich with a lettuce bun. They gave me the inside of the lettuce so I had to ask for more so I could actually use it as a \"bun\"
After I waited for that o take two bites and find a hair......so nasty. Never again."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this chain.  Great food & great service.  Salad bar was fresh & the steak I had was good too!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place for people with Celiac. I had a gluten free chili cheese burger and fries it was great. Steve B the bartender was AWESOME  very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Oh no .... This experience was definitely not what we expected its Sunday and of course the place is averagely busy so we understand people being busy but everything for the host to the server were very short and non friendly, food was average tasted like something we could've microwaved at home."}
{"text":"Not really a fan of this location, maybe not the business at all.
I have been to a few and I'm not happy with the prices and the service has been sort of crappy lately too.
Our waitress had an attitude and was rarely seen, we saw other waitresses more than her.
drinks ran out 3 times the table next to us had 3 separate sets of people sit, eat, and leave before we were done. in the end out bill was $70?!?!?! for 3 people to have a burger and fries and a drink and a side of onion rings. $9 for a stack of onion rings??? there were about 11 rings on there NOT worth it! My burger was almost $14.  My friend had a separate ticket and she ordered a salad to eat before her meal, it came with the meal, not before and they charged her for a dinner salad not a side salad. SUPPOSED TO BE UNLIMITED FRENCH FRIES, but they never come back to give them to you and it takes like 15 minutes if they do, seriously?!?!

Overall disappointed at the price, the quality, and the service!"}
{"text":"This was our best experience at Reds yet thanks to our server Irene! We have had some really crummy servers in the past and terrible experience with our orders but love the food so we keep coming back. 

Irene was so accommodating and friendly. Our boys loved her. Our food came out exactly as ordered and with little wait. We are hoping our next visit to RR will be as great as this one. And we'll be sure to sit in Irene's section if possible!"}
{"text":"I had to call store to tell them there were people waiting to be seated up front! Finally sat down waited another 10 mins after seated to be told they will help us soon... this was Sunday night at 7:00 not that busy!!"}
{"text":"I still remember my first Red Robin mushroom burger 25 years ago. Delicious!!! I've always enjoyed eating at Red Robin. It was  a great place for yummy burgers, fries, shakes and desserts! I brought my young son there 2 days ago and I was just heartbroken the minute I walked in the door. The restaurant could use a thorough cleaning, especially the windows, blinds and decor. You could clearly see where areas were wiped but items were not picked up for a proper cleaning.  I ordered the mushroom burger wich sadly was nothing special. I don't think I will be going back which saddens me since it was such a big part of my youth, and later as a young adult working at Express and hanging out with the girls after our shifts ended."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!  Waited 15 minutes for our server to get our drink order. Waited another 20 minutes for him to get our food order. Ran out of campfire sauce and drinks, asked our server for another round and more sauce...which we never received. We waited 30 minutes before saying something to the manager. He didn't even care that our server was not paying attention to our table or that our server missed every wave to get his attention nor did the manager offer to bring anything else out...he did comp our meal, but with a very poor attitude. \"Oh you weren't happy? You can go ahead and go then, don't worry about the bill.\""}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday afternoon. Place was pretty empty, very quick service but HORRIBLE food. The burgers were either very undercooked or burnt. Pretty pricey for the quantity and quality of what you get. My second time there and the last time I will be going there. Cooks and severs were more interested in the football game on the TV than the customers."}
{"text":"I asked for my wedgie burger without guacomole.   It came with guacomole. My salad had a fry in it. My husband's onion rings were greasey and burnt. When I went to pay the bill they charged me for two burgers. I will say that they took both burgers off the check. It was ok but nothing wonderful.  People seemed nice."}
{"text":"Overall, I like this place because they allow me to bring my dog if I sit in their outdoor seating area. Dog friendly restaurant with good eats at a good price.

The one gripe I have is that the awning over the outdoor seating area is not very good. Too much sun comes in during the summer months, making it hard to stay there very long."}
{"text":"Great place for the entire family. Food is pretty consistent. We've tried just about every burger there is on the menu. We love the black and bleu and the shroom burger are our faves! It's usually always pretty busy (you could wind up waiting up to 20 mins or more) here but it's worth the wait if you're not starving! Hostesses are always polite and the wait staff is great. Love how they sing happy birthday to you and you get a free sundae. Don't forget your Royalty card! :)"}
{"text":"Service was not great for Thursday at 12:30.  Store was about empty so what were they doing that was distracting them from the customers?
Food continues to just be normal, but if you aren't going to have great service you need stellar food.  Something to make us want to come back."}
{"text":"Great experience. My first visit ever to this chain. Yummy burger, super friendly service."}
{"text":"I had the Black & Bleu burger; its a delicious sirloin burger grilled with mushrooms and caramelized onions, topped with Bleu cheese and placed on a soft ciabatta bun.  The fries kept coming, which put me in carb heaven.  Our server was awesome and always made sure we were happy."}
{"text":"In the beginning Red Robin like most places was a GREAT Idea. Now its just turning into another Burger joint. Some time back the Burgers were Excellent. Now they are a little dry. I'm missing the JUICY!"}
{"text":"My family visited this place for my sons birthday and the staff was awesome. The waitress made us feel at home and made my son feel special for his birthday. The kids had so much fun that they keep asking to go back."}
{"text":"Well, when I want a good burger I go here or TGIF.  I like the big flat screens they have- I like watching while waiting for the food.  I like the Hawaiian burger with the teriyaki sauce and pineapple.  Or, anything with BBQ sauce or bacon or cheddar or Swiss cheese.  They come out hot and most of the time I get the bottomless sweet potato fries. I'm slightly addicted to sweet potato fries.
The place is clean for the most part and has a slight sports bar atmosphere.  The location at Happy Valley Rd sometimes has slow service with sometimes unpleasant staff.  I've not had problems with the Peoria location.  Make sure to join the rewards club and get your free birthday burger.  No complaints about the food."}
{"text":"Holy Hamburger Batman! This Red Robin has recently undergone a remodel and does it ever look cool -- maybe a taddish Hard Rock meets a pub kindof feel. Still super family friendly and fun -- Check out the cheeseburger stools in the lobby so fun!

As always you can have a good experience or a moderate one with service but we have never had a huge problem with it. Our server this time was right on the money and fixed errors in the order immediately (tomatoes on salad). 

Everything we ate was delicious and hot when it got to the table and we all left with full tummies. My husband and I shared the Southern Charmer (special burger) and it was so tasty. My two kiddos had the kids fish and chips and a corn dog. We also shared a pumpkin shake. 

We always enjoy Red Robin and continue to return for a fun atmosphere that is kid friendly.

Check out the 8 track wall are and the soda bottle lights in the bar. 
Lots of fun."}
{"text":"This is the very best burger joint in town! I have ate here countless times and I am NEVER disappointed. You can substitute a turkey patty for every kind of burger. Did I mention BOTTOMLESS STEAK FRIES?! No one offers bottomless fries anymore. Everything I've had here was delish. The chili is my favorite when I want something small. If I bring an appetite, I get a Turkey Chili Burger. Yum! The staff is pretty great and they offer a military discount."}
{"text":"The food itself is decent. Good variety, etc. The service however has taken a downward spiral in the past year or two though. Our latest experience will probably be our last. After waiting 10 min. for a table (not a problem) we were seated at a booth and sat there for 35 min. without a server coming by to get us started with drinks or even a \"We're super busy and we'll be with you in a minute.\" 
Nope. 
Everyone around us that were already there were being taken care of, and we were ignored. Not even a look our way. So we bounced. We were already hungry when we got there and by the time we left, we were hangry."}
{"text":"Wow ! Love the burning love burger and a cold snap beer! Service has gotten better, really seems like they know what they are doing"}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome and so are the chicken sandwiches. The best part is they give you unlimited french fries. I used to work here and I still come here"}
{"text":"The only thing that saved this review was the food. The service is HORRIBLE! We sat down, put in the order for our kids. They got their food quick. Our food on the other hand took over 25 mins - we only ordered 2 burgers with fries.Our kids were done way before us(if you're a parent then you know that ain't good). We never got offered a refill, the waitress was all over the place and had other busboys & busgirls bring us our sides. And the sides took forever to bring over. It took another 15-20 mins just to leave because AGAIN no waitress or manager to be found. I had to ask someone walking by.
Side note, the family next to us, originally got sat down in an area with NO WAITER. Like i said, service is HORRIBLE.

FOOD - that is the only thing that was good about this place. Our burgers were delicious and our kids ate EVERYTHING!

Red Robins can you please do something abt your service? Its pretty bad"}
{"text":"Our server was awesome, very nice girl and incredible helpful because I am terribley indecisive. The food was good and we didnt have to wait for the check. all in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Best Gluten Free Buns ON EARTH! Amaaaazing service at this location, always! I am SEVERLY allergic to gluten & this place NEVER makes me sick! On a wednesday @4pm I came in & sat at the bar with Sharon. She made a wonderful Cadillac margarita for me & when they discovered they were out of GF buns, the manager was so sweet & comped my burger! This must be the happiest restaurant on earth - happy employees equals great food & great service! A++++"}
{"text":"Service was just ok. The waiter spilled my beer on the table, wiped it up and left the pile of wet napkins at the edge of our table and didn't bring us our water glasses till we were already eating.  My chicken sandwich was fine.  My husband had a regular cheeseburger and they wouldn't cook it medium rare, only medium or well done. We also had the mozz sticks/fried zucchini as apps and it upset our stomaches, even my two year old had a tummy ache. 

I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"My family and I came in on Saturday for lunch. WORST dining experience ever!! Had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table....for lunch?!! Finally got seated in a corner booth in the back. DISGUSTING!!! I ask to be moved because there was food cover the crack of the booth where you sit. SO GROSS!! After switching table our server took our drink order and appetizer order. Took him at least 15 minutes to bring 2 waters, 2 diets and 2 kids drinks. Serious?!! Our appetizers came out as he was putting our drinks on the table. Then he ordered one of the wrong appetizers. We finally ordered our lunch. almost 45  minutes later we still didn't have our food. We actually walked out because it was taking too long. The manager came over but he was questioning us about how long we were really waiting for. Really....horrible customer service!! I've never walked out of restaurant before. The service was terrible, the management did not seem professional and the restaurant was a disgusting mess. We were surrounded by dirty tables. We lost our appetite. I will NEVER return to Red Robin!!!"}
{"text":"Sloooooowwwwwwwww. Couldn't believe how long it took to be served below mediocre food."}
{"text":"Always a favorite for us, great food and atmosphere at the Surprise locations. Food is always fresh and hot. Waitstaff always friendly."}
{"text":"The food is good but always a hit and miss on service.  Today they are out of 3 of their 6 draft beers.  No Stella , no Blue Moon and no Coors light.  According to the bar tender , the manager transferred and failed to order a lot of things.   Bar area is so cluttered and you can see how the screens on all of the self service machines and cash register are filthy.  Not busy but seems like not a lot of initiative to keep the place clean."}
{"text":"The service was adequate.  The toppings for the burgers were interesting and tasty, but for me a good burger starts at the beef and their beef seems like it is the same as Burger King.  The pretzel bites and cheese dip were okay.  The Margaritas were overly sweet and tasted like they came from a can.  Too much of their menu is sugar based.  I wouldn't go again.  

For about the same price you can get an incredible burger at New York Flavor down the street.  The Vogue Bistro has great burgers as well for a dollar or three more."}
{"text":"Don't bother. The manager had the opportunity to make us happy, but the 11-year-old didn't have a clue! He acted like his restaurant was in a mall and it didn't matter if customers were happy or not. We were definitely not happy. The food was so-so and the garbage we found under the table when we sat down was DISGUSTING. The server was the only person who acted like he cared if we enjoyed our time in the restaurant. Save your money! Eat at another restaurant."}
{"text":"If I didn't have to put a star I wouldn't put anything. I have been here many years ago and the hamburgers were okay. I went this time, we ordered a hamburger and a chicken wrap. I would of rather had gas station food and enjoyed it better. There fries are the worst fries you can by in the market that's why they give you endless fries, there tasteless and suck. The chicken was burned like a piece of pile wood all black. I would not go back to this place if they gave me free food for a month, they call themselves gourmet hamburgers."}
{"text":"Great service.  One of the best Red Robin's we have visited. The staff makes you feel welcome from the time you enter the restaurant. The food comes to the table promptly. All in all a great meal for a fair price. Plus the house wine is very good too!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend! Excellent customer service, and AMAZING FOOD. While our first waiter did get our order a bit wrong, the manager was quick to fix it. At first I was a little irritated but then I remembered I know how it is, I'm a server, sometimes even if you write everything down you can still get it wrong, we are all human. Thank you all for making our trip excellent and for fixing the tiny error. We still love this location all the same! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Ive, ben here a few times and it's always been OK  the food is average and the service has always been good. I like how the bar area is for adults and they usually have a deal on drinks."}
{"text":"I have always found the Red Robin to be a good place to grab a reasonably priced lunch when You don't have a lot of time, food was good, the salmon was well prepared and tasty, and love the endless fries, the service was good, overall the restaurant experience was good, the  location of the restaurant is not the best however, the metrocenter area is on the rough side
and not one I would frequent with out a good reason, for that I would take off a star."}
{"text":"Ordered Black & Bleu burger with no onions, it came out with onions. When the server brought it back they had picked the onions off...and most of the blue cheese and mushrooms. When I asked for a side of blue cheese (the whole point of the burger) I was brought a side of bleu cheese dressing. Burger was pretty tasteless and lacked the blackened seasoning. Add this to one server for a group of 20 and it equals a pretty bad experience."}
{"text":"The service okay, it was fast. But the food was not up to par for the price. The French onion soup sucked. Thin slice of cheese and the bread inside was hard as hell and the bread it came with was extra hard. My wife couldn't eat it. My roast beef dip sandwich was also not to par being 15 bucks was high for a below average sandwich. The service was so fast to it was like we were being rushed. That's the first and last ill have Red Robin."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I've been to several Red Robin restaurants both in Las Vegas and other states. Usually they are very good but this one not so much. My wife and I were seated at the high tables but the chairs were wobbly. I tried moving over a couple of chairs from another table but they were wobbly too.  I would have preferred a booth but it was never offered which is surprising since the place was half empty.  I ordered a water with my meal but couldn't drink it because it tasted awful. Even the lemon (which I didn't ask for nor did I want) couldn't help the taste. The fries were barely warm and obviously had sat for a while. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the burger tasted good. That was my first and last time at that Red Robin."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest here, the service sucks! When you have your wife and 2 daughters come in and your onion rings and burgers are soggy and cold! You have to wait for 20 minutes at a time with cups full of ice and a splash of coke and put it on repeat several times. Plus when he gave us our utensils, he handed my 2 year old a steak knife!! Not to mention I told the hostess Mallory that it was my birthday and mentioned it to the server. No birthday song and all of that stuff. I spoke with management and they said \" you got your food right?\" No care at all. Just steer clear and spend your money at McDonald's or in and out!"}
{"text":"Absolute trash customer service. Called to get a to-go order. Person picked up and then hung up on me. Called back, person picked up, put me on hold and never came back to the phone. I've been here a few other times and had similar service. I wouldn't bother if someone hadn't purchased gift cards for me. Decent enough food. Terrible service. Hard pass."}
{"text":"I wanted to order a \"gourmet\" burger as their sign advertises. When I tried to order it medium-rare I was told medium-well or well only. Huh? Gourmet burgers and you won't even cook to temperature? If you don't trust how your meat is being handled I'm sure not going to."}
{"text":"Service is just excellent, Daniel seated our family with care. The manager stopped by to ask if we needed anything...nice touch. We have 4 small kids under age 8. They made us feel welcome even though other places make us feel like we are intruding. Oh, and the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Staff was very young and lacked a sense of professionalism on any level and it was obvious there is a lack of leadership.  
Was a busy evening, the wait was reasonable though at about 15 minutes for three of us.
Shortly after being seated a young guest at another booth got sick on the floor.  Our server, who was taking our order, immediately made a big dramatic scene about how she couldn't see stuff like that and ran off to the back.
We then watched no less than 10 staff (not an exaggeration) walk by/over/around the prominent mess with no effort given to cleaning it up or acknowledgement to the guests around it.  Finally a young man with a mop bucket full of dirty kitchen water showed up to mop up the mess...  No thought given to the fact that it's a biohazard in a restaurant and obviously having no training in how to handle the situation.
He then parked the mop bucket in the dining room next to us (splashing the disgusting mix onto the wall) while having a loud conversation with another staff member about it.  He came back a few minutes later with a bucket of pungent bleach water and towel to hand wipe the floor and, using the same cloth, the seats and table top.  
Our server did eventually come back and let us know that she did put our order in.  Another server then stopped by to tell us how it reminded her of a scene in a movie where a bunch of kids puked after trying tobacco chew... I really can't make this up.  It was an experience that I will never forget.
The food?  My burger was average, but not bad and my wife's clam strips were inoffensive but rather flavorless.  Our daughters spaghetti was predictably bland.
I will be in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"We have been to this place on several occasions.  The latest visit was the best yet.  The waitress was really on top of everything!  The food was really delicious and cooked exactly to our specifications.  Even though this is a chain, it's one of the best burger places around!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Terrible the bartender  was rude never check on  us an completely  ignored us and when she did  come by acted like it was a chore to help us and do her job her name was aronda"}
{"text":"This is the one of the only restaurants we go to that my kids like and at which I also feel satisfied eating.  My five and seven year olds love it here.

The burgers are very tasty with a lot of variety.  But more importantly they also offer salads and other good healthy alternatives like vegetarian and turkey burgers.  And they taste good!  You can also get fruit salad instead of fries.

It is a clean, attractive place with what appears to be a full bar (though I haven't partaken of the alcohol here myself.)

My daughter loves the dancing robin that appears here periodically.  You don't find a dancing robin just anywhere."}
{"text":"Took grandchildren to have a Red Robin burger. The service in this particular Red Robin was terrible. We had to ask for silverware and napkins and some of the drinks never came. We have a Red Robin close to us in Washington State and it is great but this particular site needs better service and management."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed our previous visits to this Red Robin, but the last 2 trips have revealed inattentive servers.  Last night our food arrived via a manager, but we had no silverware or napkins.  As our server Brittany was no where to be found, we began our meal with fingers.  Finished our meal, dirty plates stacked on our table, along with empty drink glasses.  Britney walked by about 13 times, never once stopping to pick up dirty dishes or ask us if we needed anything.  We were never offered refills on drinks, fries, root beer floats.  Waited another 14 minutes for a check, again can't find Britney. We got up from our booth to start walking out of the restaurant, and Britney suddenly appeared with our check.   Not sure where the servers go to hide, but it must be a great place to hang out while your customers wait patiently for your return."}
{"text":"i love this location! Justin is the best server there and i will not eat unless he is working!! if you want  great experience ask for Justin!"}
{"text":"My all-time favorite burger joint! 

I don't like to eat burgers at McDonald's and Burger King, but Red Robin is an exception. 

People say that the best part of the burger is the meat. I have to agree, but there is one more factor that I consider to call it not a good burger, but an AMAZING BURGER. That factor is the...bun. The bun has herbs that makes the bread taste so much better. Plus, it is neither dry no flaky. The bun is baked to perfection. 

Did I mention that they have bottomless fries? You can have as much fries as you want. Woot!

Ladies and gentlemen, come here if you want to satisfy your burger craves. I recommend the guacamole burger and banzai burger."}
{"text":"I like their burgers and fries. My complaint was about the cleanliness at the Galleria-Henderson location. I noticed really bad greasy finger prints all over the glass divider where I was sitting. It was disgusting and I'm a guy. You need to look through this glass to see outside. I mentioned this to the waitress but received no real response. I later emailed corporate with my complaint with the location. I received a response a few days later saying that they have notified the manager of the location. Problem was they had the wrong location listed, not even the right city. If you can't respond correctly don't respond at all. Obviously they don't much care. This was bad enough that it somewhat ruined my lunch because I couldn't help but think about what else was not cleaned."}
{"text":"I got to this Red Robin about 4 - 6 times per year, and every time I have had good food and great service.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice...each time the service has been great. We were greeted right away and our server each time was great with the kids when they were ordering. Which is a huge plus with us.  Our servicer came to us with in mins of seating down. Our order was taken in a timely matter and brought to us in a timley matter even when they were slammed."}
{"text":"What a joke. Management can't obliviously manage here. Food sucks and employees act like they don't want to be here. I'll eat at my new favorite burger place called flippin good burger. Great prices great atmosphere and great people."}
{"text":"I have seen the commercials for YEARS and really wanted to try these extra special burgers, so when I happened to see one the other day, I thought I would pick up a couple burgers for me and a friend. The waiter was great, but the burgers took a really long time, and then they weren't very good at all! I ordered the Red's Double Tavern burger and the mushroom burger. Just two burgers and fries cost $24! I don't think I have ever eaten a drier burger in all my life!! Even when I dipped each bite in ranch, I had a really hard time choking half of it down. The other burger was just as hockey puck dry. I was truly disappointed,  since these burgers cost an arm and a leg, I thought they would at LEAST taste good. No seasonings, and I don't think that the mushrooms were fresh. Sadly, I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about my experience! Staff was prompt and very well informed of the menu. Food was delivered fast and fresh. Building was clean and nicely decorated. Fries and certain other sides were bottomless and our waitress Gabby C asked us if we would like another round of our sides before we could even finish what we currently had. Overall, wonderful experience and I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Food is always good as usual but your employees look very unhappy. Our server Apple took about 10 mins to get us drinks and then hardly checked on us throughout our dining experience"}
{"text":"We often go here for burgers even though there are so many other burger places on Eastern.  Service  is usually Ok, but today we had Esmeralda,she never waited on us before,she went above and beyond to make sure we had excellent service.  Thank you!  It makes people like you make us want to come back and eat here again. Our food was hot and delicious. Drinks kept refilling.  She constantly check on us.   Thnx again Esmeralda."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. My particular waiter was super talkative. I ordered a royal red robin but with a boca patty and no bacon. The burger so good with the egg on top. The streak fries was okay. I also had chips with guacamole and salsa that was subpar. Overall, the meal was good but I would only get the royal red robin boca burger again. Yummo."}
{"text":"I luv this location... Very Friendly Victor is the best if u every get him u won't be disappointed.... He know how to keep his customers happy... He does his job very well...That's y me and my hubby always go back and sit in his area... He knows the meaning of true Customer Service"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Red Robin since it first opened in Az. , and always had a great meal. But lately, I've had a lot if trouble just trying to get a table. One time I  arrived with no one waiting,  but also no host in site. Must have waited 10-15 minutes for a host: even though waiters passed the area frequently. Took another 10 minutes before I was seated; despite plenty of seating. Other times I have encountered several groups of people at the door waiting for a host. Instead if taking down info of other groups, the host walks away to check what seating is available. The host then sets the table and comes back to seat the party. This took about 5-10minutes to look and set up another 10 minutes to seat and return to the front. Other waiting guests have to stand in a crowded door way. 
This last time there were four groups waiting. Host wasn't around. I asked how long people had been waiting. \"Forever\" was the answer. People were asking the obvious question why is there only one person during dinner, and where is the manager? Every incident there was only one host during peak meal time. Other staff running around but no one helps. Where's the GM?  More people arrive,  but me and another group left. It concerns me when staff is cut down. Went to another restaurant and got seated immediately. Won't be wasting my time trying to eat at this location. It's really too bad Red Robin has flown the nest."}
{"text":"I had the Whiskey River Grilled Chicken sandwich with the fruit salad as a side.  The chicken sandwich was excellent and probably my favorite thus far.  Can't wait to have it again.  Perfect combo of ingredients.  Also tried the Guiness Beer Shake and that was incredible as well!  Probably wouldn't get the fruit salad again as a side but wanted something a little healthier than fries even though I love steak fries so hard to resist."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon. The place didn't seem very busy when we came in. But the hostess did not acknowledge us for at least 10 minutes before we were finally asked how many and another few minutes before we were seated and when we were seated, the server never came. We had to leave after 20 minutes of sitting with no drink order & no server coming to the table. It was terrible and we won't be going to the Gilbert location at San Tan any longer.

after we left, we went to the Chandler location and the service was excellent! :)"}
{"text":"Decent burger joint for a chain.  There are a lot of choices here which pretty much just involve a recombination of toppings and buns. They have some good non burger options, My favorite is the whiskey river bbq chicken wrap. The freckeled lemonade is great too.  Make sure to try the campfire sauce with your bottomless fries!"}
{"text":"Less than attractive atmosphere. I felt like I was in a tanning salon with how bright the lights were. Not ideal for a dinner. I've never written a bad review but the staff was less than helpful. Ordered the large onion rings and 20 minutes later the small came out. After we ate it, waitress said she noticed mistake and discounted our amount to just pay for the smaller onion rings. Are you kidding me? Shouldn't that have been comped? Thanks for the \"discount\"

The food took about 40minutes to get which I felt like was a little crazy given the few amount of people in the restaurant. 

I usually like Red Robin, but this particular store seems to be struggling a bit. Last time I will dine here."}
{"text":"The service was non-existent and when someone did come to our table she asked to take our order but failed to give us menus!!! WTF!  We complained to the manager whose command of the English language was lack luster.  We couldn't understand what he was saying and wasn't sure he understood what we were saying.
Overall it was the worst restaurant experience I'd ever had.   The vibe in the store was strange too - like the place is filled with hate, anger and misery.
4 waitresses came out to sing happy birthday but none of them would come over to take our order.  We sat there, they all sang and walked away.
All I can say is there's something terribly wrong with this RR location."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting family and decided to grab a few burgers. We were seated quickly, but sat for a good 15 minutes before someone came to get our drink orders. She did apologize and the restaurant wasn't that busy to excuse the lateness of coming to our table. She asked if we'd been helped and I looked down at our empty table and politely said no. 

Most often we get amazing service and the waitress was very nice that night so I can let what happened when we sat down slide."}
{"text":"Only giving this place one star because there is no option for zero starS. Our party of 3 walked in and got seated right away, no problem. However, we waited at our table for 20-25 minutes...we were never acknowledged! No water, no utensils, NO WAITER/WAITRESS! Disappointed in the horrible service we left. Terrible terrible TERRIBLE service, will not be returning."}
{"text":"What can you expect from a large chain American diner? Burgers and fries, meat and cheese, and potatoes...! 

I think this is a great place to take kids because the decor is whimsical (I stared at a huge poster of Leonardo DiCaprio my entire lunch). The prices are average but the portions are pretty big, so splitting a plate would be totally reasonable. Now, for adults...

When I got there the server was super nice and very attentive (but not to the point where she was obnoxiously intrusive). I ordered a crispy chicken salad (?) with a honey mustard poppy seed dressing. It wasn't bad, but then again I came in with lower expectations/standards. The chicken was nicely done--lightly fried and really not that greasy. The vegetables in the salad could have used some help, as they were puny and shriveled. 

Overall, I enjoyed my lunch there and even though I know the food isn't great quality, it's not too bad once in a while."}
{"text":"We come to this location a lot and we like to sit at the patio. The bartender is an awesome server! Probably one of the best we've ever had. He is there a lot and we appreciate his hospitality!"}
{"text":"Sat for 10 min.. waited for our waiter then the Mgr came by to \"save\" us as we were just about to walk out.  
Took our order over the hand rail and not directly next to us, he then reached out his hand for us to give him our menus. So far, first impression is Terrible!
Our waiter eventually came around to apologize that she was the only person in our section... which we felt the manager wasn't utilizing His staff to the fullest.  Some were blowing up balloons and others standing around waiting for another guest to sit.
Food finally came, which was the only thing good about this place. But the Mgr again kept serving us over the hand rail by filling our water. 
For the poor service and wait time, he did cut us some slack on our $15 bill by applying 20% off... wow, thanks... I would've took care of the bill if it was under $20... but who am I."}
{"text":"This is my first time back in years. It will be my last. I was in the bar area for lunch it was almost 1hour 25 min before I could get out. Ten min before my drink order and almost as long before food order. A secound drink forget it. Guy next to me walked out."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the classic cheeseburgers.  We were there about 1 PM and the place was almost empty, which is not a good sign.  We substituted the coleslaw for fries. When the waitress noticed at we were not eating the slaw, she offered to bring us fries.  This was nice. They were okay, not great. I wasn't happy that when I held the burger and noticed that the bread was cold.  Toasting or warming the bun should be customary, otherwise, why am I buying a burger when I can make a better one at home?  Good thing that the bill was less than $30.  We will not come again.  Was it a disaster? No, but a return visit, I don't think so."}
{"text":"It has been years from the last time i had a burger anywhere and was truly impressed.   After reading some dispointing reviews for Red Robin, i was shocked at how perfect everything turned out to be. I ordered the smoke n pepper burger cooked medium and my typical diet soda.  The wait person was fast, attentive, and knowledgeable.  My meal came out quickly to order.  What?  No mistakes to complain about?  Hot, juicy.  Loved the bun. The vegetable toppings perfect.  I even got a second order on the steak fries. I usually hate steak fries as they are never cooked properly.
   When it costs so much to eat a premium burger out, ($21.39 including tip, no desert), it has to be perfect or I'm not happy.   It in fact was perfect."}
{"text":"Ordered to go on Friday night. I should have checked the order before leaving when I picked it up but it was beyond packed and bartender seemed over whelmed that I just wanted to grab my food and go. Once I got home we noticed he order was wrong. The burger with no onion had onion. The burger w pineapple no pineapple. We got regular friends when we paid for cheese fries. We were so hungry we just made it work anyways. That night I was in horrible stomach pain. I wasn't able to sleep good. Next day I woke up feeling like I was catching a cold, I was hot then cold the next minute w sharp stomach pain/ cramps... I wasn't hungry for any food all day. I stayed in bed literally from morning to night, when my sister came over to check on me she said she had the same symptoms and it was from this food. Something was off. I have never felt like this before. She gave me a few tips to feel better and next day I was 50% better. I don't think I'll ever eat there again, worst food poisoning ever."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Red Robin to celebrate my sisters birthday. We had waited a substantial time for our food. About the time we went to find out waitress to say something the manager Jon approached our table. He informed us that the ticket had not been out with the tray so the food had gotten cold. He told us that they were remaking the food and that our food would be on him because of the mistake. He also gave us a free appetizer or desert for our next visit. This was a top notch display of service and care for the customer. I will definitely be back here again. On top of that the food was very good."}
{"text":"Always a safe bet for a great burger.  I had the smoke and pepper burger.  A bit pricey ($13.49), but was f'n awesome.  Also had boneless wing and Cajun chips...yumm(y)!!!  Belly full, time for a nap."}
{"text":"while everything didn't go as planned on this visit, I have to say that I was pleased with the final result of my experience. We were seated promptly, and drinks came out quickly. Our food on the other hand, took much longer that it should have. I do have to say that the waitstaff and manager both came and apologized, as well as discounted our bill, without me having to say anything. mistakes happen, and I believe that handled it well. The food itself was very good, and my four picky eating children all enjoyed the meal. Was worth the stop on the way out of town, and I would be willing to eat there again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the burgers at Red Robin are better than say your local McDonalds, Wendy's,Burger King etc...They are more on par with Chili's or Ruby Tuesdays, the vibe and ambiance is also similar to those restaurants as well.We've eaten here several times and my wife and kids really enjoy the food and service. My only complaint is that for what is at it's basics a burger joint it's a little expensive.Check it out for yourself:)"}
{"text":"Very good! Good service! Thanks to Justin, always had a full drink, he was always around and making sure everything was ok. Bacon burger was perfect, juicy, little pink. Just how I ordered. Also appetizer came out in good time and had time to eat it before the food came. Will keep going back."}
{"text":"This res robin rocks.  Selena is our waitress, and is awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of RR but lately I have tasted a burger King like flavor in their burgers, yuck!"}
{"text":"We are here once a week. Service is always fast and friendly. Food is good and cheap. A lot of the staff know us now and the manger always smiles. The club card has gotten us a lot of free food too!"}
{"text":"There are a few other burger spots in my area, but I like Red Robin best of all. The burger is just really good.  What more do you need to know.  I recommend the bbq one with bbq sauce and onion strings on it.  Ok I want one now.  Perfect for kids too with cool decor to look at and good selection of items on their menu."}
{"text":"Dang Me. Red Robin is all growed up! Hadn't been to one in 20yrs.

But a lot of the clientele, at this location anyways, hasn't. The majority maybe have their drivers license, maybe. (Families w/ kids. Lot's of families) But there I was, the biker couple, the lesbian couple, the funny retired couple, even my nextdoor neighbors (with their new born) were there. You too could be there!

Sunday late lunch, early dinner.

Sit in one of the 5-6 booths in the Bar Area! Much calmer. There is also the bar itself. 3-4 TV's for \"The Game\" so you can hang out and scarf your burger and beer (or cocktail). I recommend the 22oz. draft beers. They also have a couple \"Bottomless\" non-alcoholic Limeade drinks. All you want for $3.99. 
 
Stuffed! The folks I was with are eaters, and still the portions did their duty. Chips w/ warmed Artichoke & Spinach dip. Towering Onion Rings served like a Fisher / Price toy. http://www.fisher-price.com/img/product_shots/71050_d_1.jpg?1216605372668  Ahhhh 'comfort food\". Burger was fine. Bun was a bit hard. I scarfed it. But it is a $9 burger, could be better.
 
Didn't get into it. But I hear the steak fries are endless, as in All you Can Eat. 
And then the dessert menu arrives. NO WAY!! Next time.

Red Robin. A higher end Applebee's. If that means anything. The crew did a fine job! Cooking and presentation were great. Service was genuine and attentive. They did take care of us. Probably will of you too. Hours: Sun-Thu: 11a-10p, Fri-Sat: 11a-11p

3 starts because of the service! The kid crowd almost lost that 3rd star though.

Take 95 to W. Ann. 
West of 95, first turn is Centennial Center Blvd. up aways Cross W. Tropical Pkwy, continue about 50yards turn left. Red Robin is off to the left back side of lot. The roads out here are a work in progress. These directions should be fine though.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day. My son's chocolate milk took awhile to be delivered, however our food was scrumptious!

The bathrooms were very clean and it sounds crazy but my favorite faucets. Normal like your house ones and nice hot water!"}
{"text":"Second time I've gone to this Red Robin and I haven't been disappointed. Last time was a couple of months ago and it was super busy but we got taken care of with no problems. Tonight was a slower night, which is expected since it's a weekday, but I had a great experience. The food came out immaculate and quickly, Nasiema's customer service is awesome, John's bartending skills are just as impressive. The whole place is clean and organized, the restaurant is ran very well. I'll be back same time tomorrow. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Sometimes we like to go to Red Robin to eat my chicken crunch salad and my family some burgers,  we always take as well the dipping sauce they gave with the onions tower. And we are always disappointed,  the fries arrived at the table always cold. And we try many different locations and it's always the same.."}
{"text":"Absolute WORST restaurant experience we have ever experienced, and that says a lot because my husband and I dine out very often and both work in the service industry. We dined the evening of 5/24 and our server was BRENT. We arrived shortly after the couple we were treating and they already had their drinks when we arrived. Brent approached our table and without saying a word just stared in our direction, no greeting. We assumed that he was wanting to know what we wanted to drink so we told him. Brent seemed intoxicated while serving us, he smelt like alcohol, wouldn't make eye contact or converse with us, and was bright red and clumsy. My husband ordered a root beer float and Brent brought it in two separate glasses, one for the ice cream and one for the root beer. When he reached our table he spilt the root beer ALL OVER me and my husband! My pants, underwear and shoes were SOAKED and so was my husbands phone. And did we get an apology? NOPE! He through a towel at me to clean myself and continued to wipe down the table. Not a word. At this point we decided to inform the manager that we thought our server was intoxicated and that he spilt root beer all over us. All the manager said was \"I'll take care of it\" and again no apology. The server was gone another 10 minutes before coming back to take our actual food order. After that he kept glaring at us, wouldn't speak to us and was avoiding our table. The manager came out with the food and in front of Brent said \"so I talked to our buddy here and everything is fine!\" And again no apology!! How unprofessional! The only time we ever got any apology is when Brent handled us the bill he said \"sorry about the root beer thing\" totally unsympathetic and obviously because we were about to think about his tip. The worst part of it all is that we didn't get ANY sort of discount on the bill, not even for the root beer float! We had other places to be after dinner and I had to stop and buy new clothes because I was sticky and uncomfortable! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS RESTAURANT AND THEIR EMPLOYEES!!! Will NEVER be back!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Where was the utensils, the bottomless fries, the refills? Food was good but waited 15 minutes for server to get order and another 20 minutes for bottomless fries.... Which I am still waiting for. Server is too busy helping others. Well Red Robin you have lost a customer! Mel was our waitress and she seriously needs more training. She was nice, but really needs to get her sh*t together as a server."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place as the decor is kind of fun, the service is generally good -- if not better -- and the atmosphere is pleasant enough. However, it's the food that keeps a restaurant in my good graces, and Red Robin just keeps falling short of the mark. The fries may be bottomless, but the portion so small and so covered in Red Robin seasoning that adds nothing. The burgers, which they pride themselves on are, to me, really kind of bland. The bacon on any burger lacks flavor. On my last visit I had a grilled chicken sandwich. It was as rubbery and tasteless a piece of poultry as I've ever had. I sent it back. They delivered another sandwich quickly. It was better but still below average. Rubbery chicken (not overcooked) means one of a couple things. 1) Poor quality chicken to begin with. 2) Chicken that was frozen, thawed, then frozen again, 3) microwaved until near done and then put on a grill just to make a few grill marks. Whatever the case was, it was a bad meal and has soured me on the place.  Good service and a very contrite and polite manager can't save bad food."}
{"text":"The people are high energy, and great service, and always food is good.   Great family dining and clean."}
{"text":"Used to love this place and am now extremely disappointed. Our curbside order was wrong and missing several items that we had purchased. When we got home, we contacted the manager who agreed to partially credit our bill. It has been a week now with absolutely no credit applied. We will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad. Ethan was our server and he seemed to be everywhere else beside his tables.  At one point he was walking around his tables putting stuff into a bucket labeled \"ice only\". Our tea glasses also went dry several times. Also we were seated at a table that directly under a AC vent but that wasn't his fault. I'm sure with technology being as advanced as it's gotten there's has  to be a better way to cool than to have a single frigid cold spot"}
{"text":"Loved the food! Manager came and said hey! Told him to make sure to get his free check presenters from American Express! The server was awesome played along with our crazy family. Not usually a fan but today I am! This location was over all fantastic! Our server Sarah rocks! (:"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Red Robin alone is a good place to eat, but the service here is great too--not always easy to find. We were seated promptly, brought drinks promptly and our orders were on point. Nothing was amiss and the services was very friendly. For the price, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"I ordered the fiery ghost burger for carry out and was extremely disappointed, I opened the wrapping when I got home and realized I could have honestly got a better result driving through Burger King. For a 12 dollar burger it was smashed together no fresh jalapenos as advertised and had zero heat. What a poorly ran kitchen."}
{"text":"Food is good burgers and chicken sandwichs are both good and decently priced. Campfire sauce is awesome. Bottomless fries are a good idea but they give very little in each serving and tracking your waitress or waiter down is a chore. Service needs work. Food is fine."}
{"text":"Can some was please explain the bottomless fries thing my son and brother wanted them and then they brought us out two small baskets w eight fries in each then that was it never asked us if we wanted more seems silly any how we've been here for 40 min now no more fries and our food still hasn't shown up"}
{"text":"Took my daughter and 4 1/2 year old Grandson to Red Robin last night. Arrived around 4:45 and were seated. Not many customers at the time. Sat waiting 15 minutes for a server to bring us menus. There were 5 or 6 servers standing around chatting with each other.  Finally got up and left.  Always wondered what it would be like to be invisible.  Guess I know now.  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Just OK.. Burger was good but fries cold . Don't get the fried zucchini appetizer they ate chunks of zuchini that are hard as rocks. Bottomless fries ..  Hmm was with a party of 9 no one was ever offered any. Peach iced tea must be a syrup they put in it because it was awful until you stir it yourself."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of cheese and mushrooms on your burger, get the pub burger.  And the sweet potato fries are very good too."}
{"text":"I've been to this certain Red Robin location several times and the service and food are pretty good. 

The burgers are awesome! They have a great selection. My personal favorites are the Whiskey River BBQ Burger and the Burnin' Love Burger. Both of them will not disappoint. If I'm not feeling like a burger, I get the clucks and fries (don't get those words all mixed up when you order, but if you do, its hilarious) I recommend getting that in buffalo style if you want a little spice. It's messy but good. The bottomless steak are a two edged sword. The good news is they're bottomless. The bad news is they're steak fries. I personally am not a fan of steak fries. I'm a shoestring fry kind of guy. They do serve them with honey poppy sauce so that's a plus though. 

The food is kind of pricey. Burgers can cost anywhere from $6 to $10 so be sure to bring some cash. 

The service is a crap shoot. On some visits I've had amazing service, on others I've had really crappy service. Never in the middle though. 

The seating environment is very casual and family friendly. There are TVs everywhere playing sports games. The noise level of the place is kind of loud though. 

Red Robin has its ups and downs, but if you're into huge expensive burgers and unlimited steak fries, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Based on a recent review by another guest, I checked out the status of the chef's pants on the way in. All seemed in order, so I was seated. 

Wait staff was attentive and cheerful. Ordered the lettuce wedge appetizer which is a great value. Nice size portion and lots of yummy toppings. French onion soup was delicious as well. Ordered a dessert to go and was directed to the table top kiosk to pay. I need a printed receipt for work purposes and the kiosk \"ate\" my receipt, which meant a delay for the ticket. 

Definitely a candidate when I'm back in the area for another meal."}
{"text":"Server was very nice and attentive. The food was not the best. The food took a good while to arrive. We ordered the kids meatballs for my daughter and they were hard as a rock, as if they'd been microwaved for way too long. I sent them back and the server was very apologetic. Kids Mac n cheese was approved by my son, and my burger was pretty decent. We came here for the kid friendly atmosphere but will probably look elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Great service. Location is poorly laid out, gets very loud! All burgers were cooked as ordered and one chicken burger was done!"}
{"text":"Waitress was pretty good, but other than that there is no reason to go there. The exact kind of restaurant that makes us so obese in America! Just because its cheap doesn't make it worth it in the long run. Spend a little more money and get a better burger somwhere else. And I almost forgot, the atmosphere is obnoxious with all the kids running around..."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced very overpriced. The burgers are good always good not a huge fan of their fries even though they're free supposedly mean you're paying for him because the prices of the burgers are so high next time I go I'm gonna get a salad see how that goes the parking here is decent a big lot but it's pretty far away from the building him the way they designed it the front of the building is right on the street soit makes it hard to park close to the building"}
{"text":"Red Robin had the best salads! They used to be huge where you could only finish half and take the rest home, not anymore.... Salads are half the size and $2.00 more in price. Very disappointing.  Got a draft and made a big mistake by not asking for the price list, I almost choked when I saw my bill and was charged $7.50 for the beer, never again....."}
{"text":"Service was AMAZING! Jordan was our server & I'd go back to her anyday. She went above & beyond. Probably the best server we've had in a long time. Especially after just being in Vegas. Haha.   I will say that their booths are extremely small though. Anyone even a little over weight would need a table. Excellent food as well!"}
{"text":"Called to place a to go order. It's 4 pm. Kara puts me on hold and forgets about me. 5 minutes later I hang up and call back.  I'm upset and she doesn't apologize. She doesn't really listen to my order and asks if my husband wants his chicken burger to have pink in it. Omg NO, BARF.  Food poisoning called, from inside your restaurant!! I waited in the car when my husband went in to grab the food but it went quickly. The food was totally meh, except the onion rings were total yummy. Will probably not return. Had the loyalty card which is why I wanted this in the first place, but not worth the calories and annoying / rude employees."}
{"text":"Ae have dined here a number of times, including busy Friday evenings.  We've always had good luck with short wait times and quick delivery of our meals.  The prices are reasonable, and the food is good."}
{"text":"The best burger joint ever! I was very impressed with our waiter, Nicholas. He provided excellent service and was helpful when trying to decide. They have unlimited fries and sweet potato fries and the sauces are a nice touch. The burger was so amazing my friends and I didn't even talk to each other when the food came, we just ate. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The \"never ending fries\" idea is a hit!  I love the burger choices, but the service can be a little slow.

The atmosphere is fun and family friendly.  We eat here quite often, and will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! These hostess do not know how to seat their guest. Open up a section of you have too don't turn away money!!!"}
{"text":"No, just no!  That manager lady is clueless about customer service and serving hot food.  When will Goodyear folks start to stand up to these crappy chain restaurants. Stop giving them your hard earned money."}

{"text":"So I actually have two reviews for this place and both are bad. I went in with my daughter (a 2 year old) and received some of the worst service of my life. Then for a $20 bill they charged my card $50. When I call the manager they took care of it and said they would send coupons which I never got.  My family and I tried eating there again yesterday afternoon. The service was horrible again. No refills on drinks and we didn't even get silver wear.  We ordered my daughter grilled chicken and apple slices.  The chicken they server my 2 year old was raw inside. This is completely unexpectable. I would not recommend this place to anyone and be very careful what you eat there"}
{"text":"For a place that talks such a big game about their \"burger perfection,\" the experience has been anything but. Gave it a couple of tries and had problems each time. The first time, the burger came out cold and sloppy, and did not have the gluten-free bun that I requested. The second time, we weren't ask how we wanted our burgers cooked, and they came out charred. Also didn't have a drink delivered that I ordered. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Mall l, but I desperately need a beer break from school shopping. And since I was there, I had to have a burger. Not the best burger in town, but an acceptable alternative when out shopping"}
{"text":"Took family out for grandsons birthday got there at 6 pm 45 minutes to get a drink ordered food 30 minutes later after watching a full counter of food sit under the heat lamps for 15 minutes the server reappears with coooold food got a condescending apology from the so called manager left at 800 pm 2hrs really would not recommend this restaurant to anybody"}
{"text":"went on a Saturday night waited for a table for an hour once seated waited for 15 minutes for a server once order was put in waited 30 to 40 minutes for our order when order was received food was cold and overcookedthe server was very pleasant not real happy about the food that was delivered to us the chicken was overcooked fries were undercooked."}
{"text":"Disappointed I don't write bad reviews food was not good service was horrible. No follow through. I work in service I would get fired."}
{"text":"Would not eat here again made me so sick had food poisoning from there food on July 20 2017 can not recommend this store at all"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Great burgers, service, and atmosphere. Glasses were kept full without having to ask. Starter came out quickly as well as the food. Also, although both my mom and I got burgers, they were different types and had their own flavor. Fries were fresh and kept coming. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"After speaking to some of the workers. (not the waitresses) I will not go eat at a place whose waitresses will screw the other workers over by not giving them what they are rightfully due in tips. I was eating my dinner while speaking to some of the real workers. Dishonesty makes you lose business. I paid, did not finish my food and I left. Will not be back. I was there on a very busy weeknight (Wednesday). Will be going to fuddruckers instead. Very sad way to run a business."}
{"text":"Message to Mgnmt, I've been to this location several times. I'm starting to see a decline in overall cleanliness and service is starting to take a real hit. Seems like new people read: turnover. They don't even  act as professional as they have in the past.   And the food, fry's seem not as fresh and few on first order.

I'll try the other local West next, if it's the same way I'm guessing  the bird has flown the coop."}
{"text":"Food was good.  But the hostess was MIA both when we arrived around 130pm with at least 12 people waiting to be seated.  And again when we left.  Restaurant was not busy but it still took quite some time for food to arrive.    I've been to other Red Robins and service was very good.  Suspect it's just this location."}
{"text":"Apple grilled chicken salad hit the spot!  Just the right everything:  feta, light tasty dressing, walnuts, crisp apple bits and juicy grilled chicken.  Great service by Brittni.  Only gripe was cool draft in bar area booth."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Went there yesterday for my husbands birthday dinner with family. The staff was great with accommodating all of us. Food was great all of it lol. Such a great place for a great burger and chill atmosphere! Thanks Jack for being so patient with us and your humor also!"}
{"text":"The Jack Cantina Burger was excellent.  They use 2 1/8 pound patties, so the portion is smaller than the regular size burgers, however, they are served with bottomless fries.  Also the Mr. Pineapple Beer was excellent."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing, would not return. Many reasons... Very loud, bad food, slow service, even the water was not good."}
{"text":"We ordered the Bottomless Root Beer Float and a burger with so-called endless fries - GUESS AGAIN. 

After one root beer float, they suddenly had no more of the featured mugs they advertise that they come in and shifted to a small glass at least 1/2 the size. The restaurant was half full at 8 PM on a weekday, and they claimed they ran out of glassware, hmmmmm. The endless fries got one refill for two of us, and then the wait staff just disappeared. 

When we finally cornered our waitress and asked for another refill, she said she would take care of it, and after a long 15 minutes we got our last refills.

If they advertise something, they should serve it. As a former pro football player, I do have an appetite, but to have deceptive service of avoiding refills we will NEVER go to Red Robin again.

In hindsight, we could have gone to In-N-Out Burger for half the price and had a more delicious and satisfying dining experience."}
{"text":"Had dinner here 10-10-2016. Haven't been here in a long time (almost a year) cause I had noticed it was going down hill. Thought I would try it again, I should have not bothered! Awful, first off waitress brought my ice tea in a dirty glass. When pointed it out to her she reluctantly changed it out. While waiting for our meal asked for fries, they were old and could tell they were sitting there for awhile. Thought that maybe the fries coming with meal would be fresh.... One could only wish! They were the same, so asked server for fresh fries, they put them back in fryer and reserved them to us. Still tasted awful! Will not be coming back to this location ever!!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for burgers. Can't go wrong with bottomless fries. I always get their freckled limeade...and now they have the option of getting the limeade under 10 calories :)."}
{"text":"We came here at 3pm on a Tuesday and it was very quiet, hardly any tables filled. Our server was Jose.  It was quite a while before he even came to take our drink order.  He was very inattentive and acted like we were a huge inconvenience when we asked him to activate a second ziosk for our other child. 

However two days later we returned closer to dinner time and they seemed to have their A-team working.  We were greeted immediately and set up with a second Ziosk with no problems. Our server was very polite and I could tell she had quite a few tables but that our table was never missing a refill. Twice after we got our food she checked in to make sure we had everything we needed.  She was just very sweet and helpful. 

Bottom line- I love red Robin. It just always amuses me to see the large gaps in training. I walk away wondering if management just doesn't care  about poor customer service in the afternoon as long as they've got that A-team for the high vis evening hours."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since before the remodel, good food but are you freaking kidding me?!??? Some A Hole was allowed to hang out in the bar area with his screaming infant and the staff didn't do anything!!!! Order your food from the dining room where screaming kids are expected. Bad management I won't return."}
{"text":"The burger was great, nice and juicy. The unlimited fries were crispy and tasty. The tea was weak though. I did not like the fact that the salt & pepper shakers were made in china. If you have a successful business that charges this much for burgers, at least have your condiment shakers made on the good ole USA"}
{"text":"This place is BEYOND awful. I started with the pretzel bites. They were deep fried and nasty. They tasted like the breading on a corn dog and they came with this nasty beer cheese sauce. For my meal I ordered the CA Chicken Sandwich. The bun was wet and soggy - nasty! The chicken was tasteless. Supposedly all-you-can-eat, or as Red Robin calls them \"Bottomless fries\" were supposed to come with my sandwich. When the sandwich arrived I received only  EIGHT THIN, SMALL, DRY and TASTELESS  steak fries. That's right - only EIGHT little fries. This is the biggest scam this restaurant is running. They know that most ppl will not keep asking for the fries, and the waitress never came back until we were just about ready to leave, so I was only able to get the fries refilled ONCE and when they arrived I receive only EIGHT more thin, small and DRY steak fries. What a joke! This is SO DECEPTIVE of this restaurant it is unreal. At ANY OTHER RESTAURANT you would get more fries with only ONE order. What a joke. My husband ordered mexican chicken breasts. Instead of the salad that came with it he opted for the chicken tortilla soup- which cost $1.50 more btw. The size of the \"cup of soup\" was an absolute joke. It was so small it was unreal. The chicken was also thin and nasty. Overall, I would give this place an F. I am astonished that people are giving this place good reviews - absolutely astonished. The only people that would give this place a good review are ppl who think Wal-Mart food and Mcdonalds are good."}
{"text":"Wow! Been a while since I ate ate RR. Used to always be good with decent sized portions, USED TO BE. My burger was small and definitely had no pink as requested but also was charred. Barely edible. Came with endless fries, but they could have put more than 5 on my plate with my burger.  The topper of this visit was the HORRIBLE waiter, Moses!  This kid has the worst attitude!  Couldn't make eye contact, looked away while talking to you, never smiled, not even smart enough to smile when handing  us our check. Also I noticed most all of the staff were handing customers their plates instead of setting them in the table, sounds like a law suit waiting to happen. No reason to ever go back!

And it got worse! Was contacted by customer service who took my # and was told a customer service rep would call me and he did, Philip left a message with a case # and a phone # ( I was working and couldn't risk the call.) I called the # and Aman took my call, tried to give her my case # and she said she couldn't look it up but she could give me a new case #, which I let her do and hung up as that was all she could do for me.  Out of curiosity, I called the # Philip had called from, once again, got an operator who could give me a case # and not do anything else! This Company Is such a joke! Was discouraged before, but I can safely say I will NEVER go to a Red Robin again and I encourage you to do the same!!!"}
{"text":"Don't try this place during the weekends. They don't staff this place like they should during the weekend. Our food was not very good. Usually when we go to Red Robin the food is much better. Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Red Robins is one of our favorite food chains, but this location is pretty sub-par. We've been here twice now, and both times have been disappointing. The hostesses seem stressed out or irritated, and the sevice is extremely slow. I would expect to be here for a while if you decide to come here. The only positive here is that the bar tender is really nice. Definately sit in his area."}
{"text":"Red Robin, ummmm, NO. You've fallen into the category of overpriced, poorly prepared food, and poorly run establishments. How is it on a early Thursday evening, (before 5p.m.) your food is cold, rubbery, and unappetizing? 

My daughter ordered the Chophouse BG, and I got the Cod Fish & Chips, the fries were cold, and not thoroughly cooked. The fish were 4 fist sized chunks of cold, tough, and not crispy, or crunchy pieces of bland. 
Fish & Chips for $12.99, cook it right, or take it off the menu, and stick to burgers. 

Our server was slower than the cold patch crew for potholes. She was either having a hard time juggling her tables, or just the typical representative of this Red Robin. 
Previous trips were average, but I guess there's a reason to why our visits happen sparsely over the years. So much so, I threw away my Royalty Programs card."}
{"text":"So sad to have to update this review negatively. We used to enjoy this Red Robin often when the food used to come out hot and tasty but it has now become a place of bland cold burgers with the worst service. Servers and those running food have no clue what they're doing. Don't get excited when your food finally comes after a long wait, it's probably some other tables food. 
Alexis was our server and she is the cherry on top of why we will not be returning to Red Robin in the near future. They will rush you to pay your check before you finish chewing on your second bite of your burger. No offering desserts. No cleaning trash off your tables. So glad we came to enjoy a Friday night here to indulge..... NOT. Bye bye Red Robin."}
{"text":"I just wanted to praise the service we received tonight. We came in with 11 people and from the hostess Kelsey to our server Alissa we felt so welcome and taken care of! Alissa has such a great personality and handled our large party wonderfully, keeping up on drinks and making sure we all received the sauces etc.  we requested. It's such of breath of fresh air to have such great service thank you!!"}
{"text":"The drinks we ordered were fine and the food was good, but the service left something to be desired. Server kept \"forgetting\" to refill the water. She walked away several times while one of us was talking to her. When we were ready to leave we made eye contact and she walked right past us. We hit the \"call the server\" button at the table, nothing. My bf got up, walked towards the back to other employees sitting in a booth watching tv, and asked for a box. The server walked right past again and pretended like no one was there. Completely unacceptable service."}
{"text":"Every time I go hear it is so packed with screaming children and a 30 minute wait. As horrible as it sounds I would rather have a burger from in n out. Its just fine. Nothing that special. You go there for like a quick meal when nothing else is open. It's good. Good French fries. Just can't get the pasted the screaming children."}
{"text":"We always liked Red Robin burgers. They had excellenr portions prices and service. This is my third time coming here with the family. The technology fee is not expense but it should be an option if parents want it to be turned on. It's a stupid fee. The portions have gotten smaller and the prices have risen. The plates are basically the same size as the kids meals.. This place will only be a date night place but not for family meals. Not worth paying that much for OK food."}
{"text":"Awesome Smoke & Pepper Burger! Nice staff. The service was was great & staff very accommodating. We received the wrong order and it was corrected quickly. The manager even came out to make sure we received everything ok."}
{"text":"If there was a zero star option, that would have qualified for this restaurant. My friends and I waited for an hour for our food, with the nice benefit of having no refills of course. Once we got the food, it was cold and inedible. We didn't get any refills of fries, only ten initially to split between the three of us. 1 out of 10 stingrays would never come again, terrible customer service overall."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this new location.  It is very nicely decorated and just starting to get busy on a Friday night.

The server we had was just outstanding and made our experience very pleasant.  She explained everything on the menu and really took her time to make us feel special.  I think her name was (sp??) Darnashia. 

The food was just what you would want at a Red Robin.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the worst birthday experience today. You shouldn't be treated like a fraud when you receive an email from corporate on you birthday week for a free burger and you go in and try to use the coupon. Manager there demanded I pull up the email on my phone even though I printed it with a date info on the print out. He said it was still weird but they would take care of it. Somehow that meant they will just leave me alone including my waitress who pretended we didn't exist never offering fry dips, refills on my drinks or fries. I will never come here again. Any future trip to red robin will be down the road at the Goodyear location."}
{"text":"The service is always slow, even when it's not busy. Maybe have more people working? You will always get seated quickly, but be prepared to wait 15 min for your waiter to stop by. Food is good for burgers and drinks, but the lack of service kills it. Don't get me wrong, waiters and waitresses are super nice, I just think they have too many tables to handle."}
{"text":"The old Red Robin set-up was great, but things have unfortunately changed for the worse since it opened. Their burgers used to be served wrapped in paper, in a traditional burger joint red plastic basket with a healthy portion of the bottomless fries. Their plating has changed to more of a \"trendy\" style, with odd rectangular plates, and the bugers are no longer wrapped in paper for easy eating, the bottomless fries are now served in those silver metal rings, and it is a very small portion. They have also become very stingy about refilling the fries, and they take a long time, and arrive in very small amounts. The whole point of Red Robin was good, cheap burgers and fries served in large portions, and their freckled lemonade and desert drinks (mikshakes, root beer floats, etc...). They are now trying to cater to a slightly more upscale market, and they are kind of taking the fun out of Red Robin. It's supposed to be a family friendly burger joint, not a higher end chain restaurant, so they need to try to go back to trying to appeal to their old crowd. They also changed their decor a little bit, getting rid of the goofy robin statues and trying to make the restaurant more \"adult-like\", which was not a smart business decision. The place is meant to be a fun place for families, and the old decor fit that much better than the newer decor does. The food is still good, but they truly need to increase their portion sizes back to normal and go back to their roots as a family friendly burger joint if they want to see bigger crowds like they did back when they first opened. Granted, there wasn't as much competition on Rockside Road back then, but Red Robin can still be successful in this crowded marketplace if it goes back to standing out as something unique."}
{"text":"So much better than my last visit earlier in the year. Remodeled and super friendly staff. Glad the scary, angry guy at the bar is gone. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We love Red Robin! Food is always good! Lots of items are bottomless, including the fries and kids Mac and cheese! And they are wonderful with food allergies. This is one of the few places I trust to bring my child with food allergies."}
{"text":"The food when we got it was cold. I asked for a each when the guy asked and it never came so I had to ask again finally came once the food was finished. My burger I asked to be medium and she didn't seem to understand and just kept saying pink. My strawberry lemonade had no flavor of strawberry. Recommend going to another location"}
{"text":"It is ridiculous ... We reached the place at 9:30 pm and the place was hardly a handful of customers . We waited for almost 10 minutes at the front desk and neither did the staff greet us nor helped us with seating. 
They all were busy cleaning and arranging glasses at the bar counter.  
Even though I like their burgers, I would never go there again .  The place seriously lacks customer service and needs grooming ."}
{"text":"RR is consistently a great place to visit.  It is clean and has really great food.  They don't even blink an eye when asked to customize a meal, no matter how odd.  This place is good for families, as well as elderly.  Alison is always a fantastic server; a ray of sunshine."}
{"text":"The service was AMAZING! Bastian is one of the best servers I've ever had at any restaurant...literally. Ask for him and tip him well!Super professional and made every effort to cater to our needs. Unfortunately the quality of food wasn't that great. The meat was bland and tough, maybe they didn't do the best job cooking our food, but it wasn't anything special at all. Not sure I'll be back, to be honest, but solely because of my food preference. I'm not big on chain restaurants because of the food quality."}
{"text":"Nice place. Nice people..... shout out to Mike our bartender! He took our order, made sure that we were happy and satisfied customers!! Service was great! Food was great! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I tend to avoid chains and I don't eat burgers and fries very often, so this place isn't really catering to me, anyhow... but for what it was, I didn't love it and I didn't hate it.

Here's what I didn't love:

I thought that the fries were supposed to be bottomless, but the server did not replenish them. 

The restaurant is really loud.

For what I had -- burger, fries, and a soda -- I ended up leaving $20 for my portion of the meal. That's too expensive for what I had. I don't want to pay that much for a meal like that unless I'm at a theme park or somewhere else with more of a geographic monopoly... or unless it's like the best burger and fries of all time, which it wasn't.


Here's what I did like: 

Even though the restaurant was crowded, we were seated quickly (party of 4). 

The two teenagers who were in our party wanted to share a milkshake and the server brought it already split into two for them, which was nice. 

My burger (guacamole bacon) was cooked the way I asked (medium rare -- sometimes places like this overcook even when I ask for medium rare) and tasted pretty good. It wasn't my favorite burger, but it was fine. 

I upgraded to sweet potato fries, and I liked them!

Anyhow, it's Red Robin. It's a chain. You know what it's going to be before you go, probably. We went because the teenagers in our party wanted to go. It wasn't my choice, but I thought I would share. There is a Red Robin really n ear my house in Delaware, and I never go and likely won't go. No judgment if you like it... it's just not my thing!"}
{"text":"I love Red Robin. It's always a top 5 restaurant when my wife and I are deciding on where to eat. This particular location is the worst I've been to. 

The floors are sticky. The hostesses were unhelpful and dismissive. The bathrooms look like they havent been visited by a cleaner in hours. Our server didn't introduce himself and got right into \"are you guys ready to order?\" Followed immediately by \"hold on I'll be right back. I forgot my pen\". 

All of this still isn't a dealbreak for me because of how much I love the food. 

The way the kitchen looked when I left the bathroom is another story. The photo I posted speaks for itself. This place is filthy. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that they forgot to bring the dip I ordered, it was a special one they have on the menu, when I pointed that out to the server, he just said they did not charge me for it, but he did not even apologize. Also the burger we ordered was supposed to have bacon and they forgot that too, the manager took off $1.50 from our bill. Definitely NOT coming back!"}
{"text":"World's slowest service. Literally ever!! A server (not ours) spilled a beer all over our table (including our meal that was FINALLY delivered!! husbands phone, our seats) not the best clean up job, 2 of us sat in beer, phone saved thankfully.  Too much time to in-between replacing beer soaked fries and refill fries (at least 20 minutes!) Waaayyy over-priced for what was delivered.  If you're thinking of a burger, skip here, there's plenty more delicious burger joints (mom & pop type!) that won't have you waiting.... forever AND breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Prefer this location to the Shea 101 locale which is closer to my home. The decor is slightly higher end and the waitstaff, especially the bar staff are always on point. The food I've seen and tasted coming out of the kitchen looks and tastes great."}
{"text":"So disappointed in tonight's service. We came in for my son's 4th birthday. He's one of those kids that likes a lot of attention so we were hoping for the server to play along.  First when we walked in the hostess said the wait would be 15 minutes because several servers were late to work. That's not a good sign. So we were seated and Ricky came over to greet us. No personality. We tell him it's our sons birthday and he just says ok.  Drinks and food were adequate/ nothing was really that much of a standout.  The salad I got tasted wilted.  The kicker to all of it... The server forgot his birthday.  He brings the check and my husband quietly mentions hey... His birthday. Ricky says oh yeah and walks off with zero apology.  They come out, sing the song, and walk off without saying a word.  What a disappointment.  We will never be back thanks to Ricky's awful service."}
{"text":"I am SO ANNOYED with this location's to-go service! 

I am giving two stars because things I enjoy about this establishment are: 1) They've never gotten my order wrong and 2) The food has always been up to par and consistent with other locations. 

HOWEVER, I call to place an order to go on a weekday, and they immediately put me on hold to transfer my call. Like, why does my call need to be transferred? Aren't most calls for to go orders? Why is there no designated person to answer the phone, ready to take orders? On top of that, I'm on hold for 6 MINUTES before I hang up and try again. My call gets answered in just two rings, and I get placed on hold again...FOR FOUR MORE MINUTES. That's when my husband and I decided to get dinner elsewhere. Obviously they don't want our money, they don't value our business. 

Other times I've gotten through and placed an order successfully over the phone, I show up the 15-20 quoted minutes later to have to wait around the bar (once a whole 20 more minutes--yeah, my fries were soggy). 

My take-out experiences with this place are just so bad that I am not sure it will even be an option for us anymore. It's not worth the battle. It makes me mad to get bad service, and then I don't even get the food I want out of it, because I can't justify sticking around for bad service--and they don't care. I could yell or speak with the manager or whatever, but then I just become \"that\" customer. I'd rather just vent with this review and encourage the staff to STEP THEIR GAME UP. 

Please. Because I really love a good whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap on a Wednesday night at home, and it burns my biscuits when I have to be on hold for 10 collective minutes, only to just give up and get Wendy's. :("}
{"text":"First let me start by saying I've been here several times and feel like every time we come there is an issue. Today, our family of 6 ordered several different things. Burgers were all good, as were the kids meals. However the fries we absolutely NASTY!!! They had a weird flavor to them. Almost like a burnt flavor. My husband says it tasted like something fell into the fryer and died. It was all the fries. I ordered sweet potato fries and they were the same way. Said something to the waitress and she came back to report that we weren't the first ones to complain today. Here's to hoping we don't end up sick from whatever the nastiness was that was in the fryer with the French fries. Gross!!!!! So turned off from eating her again. On another note, the server was great!!!"}
{"text":"If the goal is burgers and fries this place hits the nail on the head. It's tasty and doesn't pound your wallet. Cheap beer as well if you like to imbibe. Good hangout with a good friend."}
{"text":"We've been dining at this Red Robin location for years, with increasingly awful service. We kept going there because our kids love it. But after our last visit this week, when our table had large chunks of a previous diner's food littering the floor under our table, it took forever to receive our food (on a Monday night), our one special request (no onions on a burger) was ignored, and our water glasses sat empty for 10+ minutes with no visits from our waitress... We're finally done with this place and will not be coming back. One of our favorite things about Red Robin used to be the friendly, attentive wait staff. Perhaps it's just this location, but literally 90% of the servers we've had here have been very inattentive and occasionally downright rude. Very disappointing. Do better, Red Robin!"}
{"text":"Food was fucking sick ! Came out cold an tasted horrible I'll never recommend this place to anyone ever"}
{"text":"I went in recently and had a good experience. They had just done a remodel to cater to adults more. My waiter was prompt, courteous and never let my soda pop run out. That's always a good sign!"}
{"text":"I would say the service was terrible, but we never even got service! We sat at our table for 15 minutes without anyone even acknowledging us. There were servers everywhere, but not a single person came over."}
{"text":"Let me start with customer service, wich is huge to me because it's your first impression of an establishment
Hostess was prompt and cheerful, after getting sat, immediately a server came over to get our drink order,another server checked on us in the meantime before drinks were delivered, we put in appetizer order, then Kristen or server cane over and introduced herself
Wonderful lady with a super personality and plenty of smiles and laughter 
We had a great time chatting it up with Kristen. 
 This place definitely has team work in order. 
We had onion rings, fiery burger and seafood platter, all great food 
Some people think its pricey, but you can't put a price on quality food and great service from all staff
Thank you Kristen for your great service and suggestions, we will be back to see you
Kimmy and Chris"}
{"text":"Always a good place to go with the family. Love the fries as usual and the bottomless barq's root beer floats are a great way to beat the heat. The atmosphere of the place is hip and in style, and not cluttered.The waiters are not trashy but they are classy and sassy. If you need to have a quiet conversation Red Robin is not the place to go. 10 minutes for all the food to come and we are off."}
{"text":"Thank you Red Robin for your lovely display honoring our military this Memorial Day. It is always a good feeling to visit establishments that honor the sacrifices of our military. Food was delicious as always. Server Reginald was terrific."}
{"text":"Our waitress had very good customer service. Some of the employees seem to get lost easy. As for the food...... They got 3 of our 5 plates wrong, and I'm sure it is because of the young teens cooking the food. They seem to play games in the back and do not take there job seriously. I feel bad that they will be serving our veterans free burgers on 11-11-14."}
{"text":"Terrible and rude service, disappointing.  Friend applied and had interview, Red Robin didn't even have the courtesy to call back.... Food was cold and undercooked, appetizer was decent.  Too many place to eat at, be treat well, get great food and tip 25% that we are comfortable tipping when the restaurant deserves it.  This one did not.  Highly unrecommended."}
{"text":"This Red Robin is right down the street from my house and I am there on a monthly basis. The food is just like any other Red Robin really good but what really sets this location apart is the staff. I always get the best service no matter what waiter or waitress I get. The last time I was there one of the waitresses recognized us from a couple weeks before and made sure to come by and bring us a basket of fries and a large thing of ranch before our food came out. I have never had better service."}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service. Food is ok... the only thing good about this place is that there is unlimited fries with your meal."}
{"text":"Went to RR this evening with a party of 6 including a 2 year old.  Took over 45 minutes for some of the food to be ready - not all of the entrees. Complained to the manager and still after 10 minutes the food wasn't ready.  Left without eating."}
{"text":"The food was sub-par to above average. However, the service was the worst I've had at any restaurant of this price.The waitress completely forgot about us and didn't come back once. The only reason she gave us our check is because we stopped her. I have come here multiple times and this isn't the first time we've had poor service. We thought this time would be different but it wasn't. Laura or something like that was the name of the waitress she should be fired immediately. The food was the only redeeming part I just wish our waitress had given us or even offered \"bottomless\" fries."}
{"text":"Red Robin has a nice selection of burgers. Love the basic bacon cheese burger. mustard and ketchup. The ol americana.   Drink prices are decent on happy hour.  Many cheaper choices. But if you want to sit and enjoy a juicy burger and a beverage this is a great spot. Staff is always attentive. Manager always visits our table and asks if all is okay.   Thumbs up here"}
{"text":"Normally i would avoid this place all together but a friend wanted to go.  I hated every minute of it.  Horrible service all the way from the hostess experience to getting final bill.  They were all confused at hostess station and she had an attitude.  Finally sat in bar and had about 5 different people trying to take care of the table, total chaos.  Took forever to get food which was then cold, no one came back to ask if anything was wrong.  Had to flag someone down to get extra fries which is supposed to be their big thing.  I don't know how this place stays in business!"}
{"text":"Ok I havent eaten here, but I imagine its as good as the other robins Ive ate at. So why the review? Without blowing my cover, Im posting this on behalf of the staff who went above and beyond for a disabled customer to ensure that she made it onto the transit system safely. The two young gents were even willing to foot the $50 dollar cab ride home for her, but that wasnt necessary as she ended up taking public transportation home. One of the guys even pushed her scooter all the way to bus stop! (I think it was like two miles or more!) Wow.. nice to know that there are some good  people still left in this world. I promised em I would write them a review so here it is!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible I returned a burger explained what was wrong and was brought the exact same wet soggy burger. If you can't smell the burger cooking from the parking lot stay away. The burger was so poor I might as well have been eating whataburger"}
{"text":"To begin, I'm not usually one to dine out at chain restaurants. It was late though and a few of our usual spots were already closed on a Tuesday night. After settling on Red Robin, we walked in to be greeted promptly. The hostess than had us wait a few minutes as she walked away, which I assumed was to clean a table. Needless to say, she returns and takes us in the opposite direction and attempts to seat us at a dirty table. She quickly noticed it wasn't clean and took us to another.... Which was dirty as well! WTF.... Clean the damn tables please. So we stand there awkwardly as she heads to find someone to clean it. I look around the corner and there is a dining area of about 15 tables that are all empty. I have worked in restaurants and know that the section was already closed and detailed but why keep us hovering awkwardly. Finally someone, who I guess was the manager comes and wipes down the table but leaves it much too wet. She tells us she will be right back to dry it off. At this point I am irritated, and not one person has yet to apologize. We sit finally and immediately notice how disgusting the floor is. That shit hasn't been swept in months it seems! Food, napkins, utensils and everything in between. I was horrified at this point and after waiting another 5 minutes for a server just got up and left.

What a nightmare this place is!! I wish I could give it negative stars. I will literally never again dine in any Red Robin again in my life. This place is a joke"}
{"text":"My last visit to Red Robin was a perfect example of bare minimum service. What I mean by that is the lowest amount for the standard tip.
1. The 12 min. wait for a seat even though there was 9 free tables, 6 of which were in between stationed areas- the remaining 3 was probably closed off.
2. The server provided one refill for drinks.
3. Service was relatively quick, but server was not aware of terminology on their own menu. (I ordered \"bunless\" and printed on the menu, a note says, \"Order it BUNLESS, get your burger wrapped in lettuce.\" Yet she still asked me if I wanted my burger to be wrapped in lettuce.)
This would normally warrant a 2 star rating but oddly enough this sub par service was not as bad as most of the places I've been to as of lately.
I wanna say keep it up, but you can do better. Just think about food service in the 80's and 90's. They only looked for 10% gratuity but their excellence far exceeds today's standards."}
{"text":"Went to RR last night and it was great. Even though it was packed.Have a food allergy and went over the top to help and make it right. The service was also great the server never let your glass be empty. Always there with a fresh one."}
{"text":"This is a regular place for my family. It the service has gotten worse and worse.  Wrong drink orders. Late cold and sloppy food. Have to beg multiple people for napkins. Drinks are strong but specialty drinks do not have listed ingredients. The chaos is not organized.  Even the ranch has changed!! I hope they improve soon. Ive seen it better and enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"We came here over the holiday weekend. Tasia was our server, she was excellent and attentive to our needs. She was great with our kids. Bacon cheese burger was delicious! We will come back to this location!"}
{"text":"I would give them a 0 if I could. I'm going to Red Robin many dozens of times over the years. I thought I had gone for the last time but decided one more try. I had a salad and onion rings and iced tea. The only thing colder than the salad of the onion rings was the ice tea. The chicken in the salad was rubbery and cold so were the onion rings the only thing getting more at the Red Robin is the cost that's it I'll never go again"}
{"text":"Red tavern burger and bottomless fries with a side of ranch, tavern sauce and $3 drafts please! only thing I would recommend is cleaner bathroom I've been there during the week and on the weekends too and every time the bathroom is horrendous!"}
{"text":"As a hunter for the perfect burger, and a 20 year cook, I have already realized that perfection is in the mouth of the beholder, and you really have to share the taste of chef who developed the combination in question. Today, I had the chophouse burger. It was different than most burgers I had tried, but well prepared and refreshing. I may even opt to have it again, so long as I am seated and tended to by a food server.
     I have gathered that food service from 2000 to present has become disgraceful (compared to that of pre-2000) so I don't set my expectations too high when I dine out.
     But eating at the bar was nothing short of piss-poor. I have queried 3 different employees on information of the a couple of menu items- 2 of which admitted that they were in the gray and my server- the bartender- said she would find out. It took her 12 minutes to retrieve that information. I had already finished one glass of water which was placed under a dusty tapper, which I wiped off myself (witnessed by another employee) before my order could finally be taken and sent back to the cook. I can understand her distress as she had to tend to 2 others who were sitting at the bar and keep up with after-work plans with her co-workers (said sarcastically.) 
     Before I finished my only round of fries (if I had been seated, I would have been offered a refill), I added an entree to go. Just a bit over five minutes later, she returns with my order, already bagged, and to any one else with a 5th grade education would have recognized that I had no other business but to pay for my food. She placed my order beside my two empty beverage containers and continued doing what she was doing- not wiping down service areas and gossiping with her cohort. Another 10 minutes had passed when she finally asked if I wanted to pay my bill. Duh! I would've waved her down for the bill, but I wanted to be able to justify her $1.16 tip, far more than she deserved.
  I would have liked to hear her complain of the sickly gratuity, but I had already spent 1hr and 3 minutes for business that could have been resolved in 25 generous minutes."}
{"text":"My other half & I love the bottomless fries and this location is pretty great about staying on top of the fry refills and not giving attitude when you get (3) before being ready to pay. Burgers are consistently good and its typically not crazy busy so the atmosphere in the bar area is calm and good to talk in."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed todays food at Red Robbin."}
{"text":"Good grief, people, it's a chain restaurant. You pretty much know what you're going to get when you come here: decent food, plenty of it, at a reasonable price. If you go in expecting the best food you've ever had, you're gonna have a bad time. Recognize that this place calls itself \"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers\" for two reasons: 90% of the people who eat here equate \"big and messy with lots of stuff on it\" with \"good burger,\" and \"Red Robin Really Big and Messy Burgers That Taste Pretty Ok\" didn't test as well with focus groups. 

If you want a really good burger, go to a specialty burger joint that's not a chain. If you want a big burger loaded with a lot of flavorful things like bacon, jalapenos, avocado, and barbecue sauce, accompanied by a ton of fries and a frosty adult beverage, Red Robin would be a good choice. 

Is it truly gourmet? Not hardly. Is it gourmet enough for most Americans? Definitely. 

Anyway, I went to this location while in town on business. Nothing that I wasn't expecting, and just what I was looking for: a decent burger, some fries, and a frosty adult beverage on the company's dime. Service wasn't the best I've ever had but was perfectly acceptable, the food was plentiful and tasty, the beer was cold, and the company paid for it. Nothing to complain about. 

In the future, folks, when you write a review of a chain restaurant, rate it according to your expectations of it as a chain, and don't try to be a food critic."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to take my sister in law out for her birthday. We were so excited to come here because she always talked about it. When we arrived there were not so many people. Our server's name was Ashley, this girl was very rude and snobby and looked like she did not want to be there. We placed our not so complicated order and when the food finally arrived I had a feeling there was going to be some issues. My fries were cold and I  politely  ask Ashley to get me an order of fresh fries. She look so irritated and bothered by my request. Than my husband bit his burger and simply by his non verbal response I knew he did not like his food. He said five guys taste so much better and didn't even eat the burger because it was cold . We were sitting there waiting for some one to refill our bottomless drinks and fries. So my husband actually went in the kitchen to speak to the manager and asked him to remove his burger off the bill and the manager did. Than Ashley comes around and says \" I notice half your bill was taking care of anything you need.!\" First of all snob Ashley the reason why half my bill was taken care of was because your service was horrible and the establishment you work for can't make good, quality food.
Buyer beware DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there because we had a gift card.  A little pricey, but the food is good.  It's also messy. Keep the wrapper on your sandwich.  Bottomless french fries."}
{"text":"Very slow to get service here 15min. For drinks 35min. For food. And they weren't even packed there were some empty tables. Just not enough staffing. But food was good just be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Service was good from both our server and the girl who brought out our food. She was actually very nice. But the hostess at the front was rude and when we asked to sit in the bar with our 13 year old to watch football we were told that wasn't allowed. Although we had sat in there recently and at several other places. Seemed a little strange but we did not say anything. Looked up the law on this and it is allowed. Is this a red robin in policy, because if so we won't come to watch football anymore."}
{"text":"This Red Robin really struggles getting it right.  Our food is consistently not hot when it arrives at our table.  We ate lunch yesterday  (restaurant  was only half full) and I watched our food sit under the warming lights for at least 8 minutes.  The waiter kept telling me our order would be our shortly.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and waited to see if this was indeed our food and it was.  Fries were soggy and cold burger was only warm, kids meals were luke warm.  I sent the burger back and told him I watched the food sit there the whole time under the lamps and wanted a fresh one made.  Manager came over and gave us some hot fries while they remade the food but that was about it.  Not really any apologies were made.  This Red Robin is getting taken out of our rotation of restaurants."}
{"text":"Red Robin is the array of hot girls I dated in my youth. Looks good, nice to show off, everything is nice...at first! Friendly service greets you and takes your order in a well-kept and energetic establishment. As you wait longer and longer for you water, soda, food...it would seem your bipolar waitress/hot girlfriend is starting to drift to the darkside.

Food arrives and it's great! Just what I ordered and it tastes like they know what they're doing. I knew that girl wasn't crazy. I guess I'll keep dating her.

Check arrives. Dang, didn't I look at the menu prices? I didn't realize she was this high maintenance. Maybe her purse was Gucci in disguise. Maybe I'm really at Spago. Okay...so it's not that expensive...but you could have a got a Big Daddy's burger for a similar price.

I rate this a four based off the food mostly. The service is sketchy in a ticket scalper sort of way...and the prices are the same."}
{"text":"Buffalo Clucks - amazing
Sweet sauce, not the best on the pizza
Well Done burger means BURNT (be careful what you ask for)
Bugers were a little heavy on the salt
Very Berry Raspberry was \"life changing\", says my niece Danielle B.
Onion rings were heavenly... will do these again
Overall service was alright, a little \"front porchy\", but alright."}
{"text":"Great service, exchanged the sandwich I ordered wrong for FREE. Food was good as always. Chocolate milkshakes did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very nice, our children have peanut allergies and she was very informative regarding allergies. The food was really good and quick. The manager came around checking to make sure every thing was great! Good times!"}
{"text":"I was there the other day for my free birthday burger and the quality of this place has really gone down. I'm asking Red Robin, if this place consistently advertises bottomless fries etc...., then why does it seem like I have to pull teeth just to get a second helping of fries? It's a battle just to get the waiter to come over and ask us if we want more fries! I would not recommend this place to anyone at this time. Get your act together Red Robin!

After this review was posted, a Red Robin GM contacted me through Yelp asking to email them. Quite frankly, I have lost interest in Red Robin and I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Red Robin is consistently good. This is the first time that we have been to this location, but we have been to several others and they are always good. 

My husband and I sit in the smoke free bar area if the place is busy and it often is very busy! 

I almost always get the whiskey river BBQ chicken sandwich and broccoli because it is great!"}
{"text":"IF I COULD give this place NO Stars I WOULD. It's the worst place we have EVER eaten. My food was cold. I ordered onion strings with my meal, they tasted like the were reheated in the microwave. My broccoli was ice cold n my burger wasn't cooked the way I asked. The cheese curds were like chewing cold rubber pieces n the kids mac n cheese was Kraft. The floors were disgusting, food n napkins everywhere. The appetizer plates were dirty with hard cheese on them, we asked for clean ones n the 2nd set of plates were also dirty along with dirty silverware. Then my husband went to the men's room n said there were towels under the urinal soaking up whatever was leaking below. DISGUSTING!  There were 8 ppl in our party n everyone had a complaint.  So uncalled for. Then the manager acted like she could care less. She had NO manager skills what so ever. Needless to say the 8 of us will NEVER go back there again!!!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic visit to Red Robin. My recent trip was on Sunday July 12 at 2100

My wife and I walked in and were seated right away, at a booth in the bar area.

Our waitress, Jessica, was prompt with our drink orders and her overall service was fantastic.

My go to meal is the Tavern Double with a chocolate milkshake. The burger was warm and juicy and the fries were fresh from the fryer and salted to perfection. I decided to try the Thai Chili sauce with my fries. To me the taste resembles the Thai 'R' Cracker from Quaker Steak, if you like Thai 'R' Cracker give the Thai Chili sauce at Red Robin a try.

To finish the meal we ordered the Chocolate Fruffles. These are like eating a fudgy chocolate brownie in stick form. The sea salt dusted on the outside enhances the chocolate taste. I preferred the strawberry jam dipping sauce but my wife preferred the chocolate and we each had the whipped cream as our second favorite, but they are all good.

If you go to this location ask for Jessica, her service was fantastic."}
{"text":"I went to RR for my birthday burger.  The waitress looked as if she crawled out of bed & ran to work!  Very dingy appearance.  I told her I know what I may order but give me a minute.  She never came back. So another waiter my order.  The presentation look good, however the burger meat tasted like it was on the edge of being spoiled.  I tried to eat it & didn't complain because it was a bd burger.  I left after they gave me a to go box. I felt sime rumbling in my stomach.  By the time I got home. I had to use the bathroom quickly! I began to feel sick on both ends. Oh I specifically requested no spicy ingredients on my slaw. They re-made it by slapping some pkain mayo on it by this time I had enough and departed. I pkan to contact the manager tomorrow. ....if I can stay out of the bathroom on my breaks at work. Thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Red Robin is a family favorite. I would give Red Robin chain a 4-5, but my last eperience, I would give this location a 3 maybe. But I have been here in the past with better experiences. So I'm giving a VERY GENEROUS 4. The service was great! The food wasn't great this time.

They did a remodel in the last year, and I have to say I do NOT like it. They went for a more fancy/classy feel...and it totally takes away from the family atmosphere you expect from Red Robin!"}
{"text":"If you sit with Ashley as your server. I feel sorry for you. She would come to our table (WHICH WAS RARE) and remember what she forgot to bring us. Happened twice. She didn't even start us up when we came. Someone filled in for her until she was ready for us. If you're not ready for us then don't even take the table. She was simply horrible and rude. Only 2 stars for the food we ate. And there's no point in advertising unlimited fries when they don't even bother supplying you for a requested round."}
{"text":"This review is strictly dedicated for the server Chris. We were a party of 6 and he was so attentive and great! We were a little difficult to handle sometimes but you were always checking up on us making sure everything was perfect. Thanks again I wish a lot of servers were like you. The food was delicious also. My favorite location to go to is this one!"}
{"text":"Since my last visit and review I gotta say they definitely had some positive changes. Our waitress seemed to be on top of her game and food came in perfect timing. Burgers cooked perfectly. Only complaint was greeters which there seemed to be three and were kind of confused when the place started getting packed."}
{"text":"Arrived 10 minutes ago.... Still waiting behind three other people to be seated. :( Asked bar tender for help..couldn't be bothered."}
{"text":"Went here a couple Fridays and left confused and amused. The server Summer was attentive and friendly, but the runners, bussers and management seemed to be lost  and unable to connect on anything during this visit. Appetizers took 20+ minutes, meal came 20+ after, one of our burgers was wrong taking another 20+ minutes and forget about trying to get napkins. 

The server was not at fault. She made every attempt to give us great service. The MOD did comp the burger that was wrong, but by the time I received it I was full on lukewarm steak fries and bored with the circus show. Nice gesture, but didn't solve the issue.

I am a fan of Red Robin and used to enjoy dining at this location, but this visit was such an epic fail that I couldn't even get mad...my girlfriend and I could only laugh and wonder what else could possibly go wrong...plenty did."}
{"text":"Good burger hop.

Order your fries as an appitizer. They are bottomless....
So get the dinner you want. And have them bring out the fries first.
Get them garlic.. they are bomb"}
{"text":"This place really went downhill. I use to love their burgers here but now they're below average. The service is pretty awful too. We waited over an hour for a burger when they weren't even busy. Do yourself a favor and go down to BJs down the street for a much better burger and experience."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Red Robin in years but a few of us from work decided to try someplace new. The waitress was pleasant enough but slow. We had plenty of time to review the menu so when she came to get the drink order we were ready to order and told her separate checks and that we were on our lunch hour. From there things went down hill. We waited 10 minutes for our drinks, a half hour for our food, our drink refills came with our checks, never had a chance to order more fries, and all of our checks were wrong. In addition, we were there over an hour and a half!  

I had their $7 Tavern burger and garlic parm fries. They were great!  My friends had Red Robin's over $15 gourmet burgers and their comments were never again and the bun was the best part. 

It may be years before I go back to Red Robin again."}
{"text":"i dont eat here much but everytime i come the experience is better & better everytime!

the service is spectacular as everyone in the staff is so nice! freckled lemonade & steak fries are bottomless!!! omg i could sit there for hours & just eat!! burgers are great too of course! you will not leave hungry!!! everyone loves burgers & fries

two thumbs up to red robin!"}
{"text":"Disappointing location. The one on Cooper and Baseline is much better. The fries were mealy and salt deprived. The Royal Burger fell apart and the meat didn't have much flavor and was excessively salty."}
{"text":"As I walked in Red Robin, I was greeted with a smile and felt important.  The appetizer was hot and cheesy.  One thing I look at is the manager when I come into a restaurant.  The manager is Jeff and he was very active in helping his staff. He assisted in delivering class A customer service to cleaning a small spill on the floor. I always say if the manager is visible and helpful, he or she cares for their business. Our waitress was Rachel. She was very nice and suggested appetizers.  Once she said cheese sticks, we ordered them. Yum. The bathroom was clean and dining area was clean. I checked for dust on the pictures, it was clean.  I asked Rachel if her manager, Jeff, is always helpful and she replied that he is always helpful. I will come back a eat here again."}
{"text":"I have been to many Red Robins and this is the  worst one. The servers stand around talking as the manager watching  this behavior and allows it. The service is slow and no attention to detail or customer service. You wait over ten minutes for food and drink refills. They advertise unlimited refills good luck getting them. We have been here over four times before I am leaving this review. Things have not changed."}
{"text":"Ok I was out and about with my mother, sister and nephews. My mom wanted a hamburger. So we decided to go to Red Robin. They were busy, being a Saturday afternoon. We waited over 20 mins to be seated. We finally are called for our table. We get there and the table is not ready and very cramped against other tables. So now we wait for our server.......and we wait......still waiting over 15 minutes have passed. Other tables around us have been greeted and had their drink orders taken. Our party nothing. Trying to grab any servers attention is a fail. I am irritated at this point. My mom is hungry and getting fustrated too. I decide at this point enough is enough. I tell them we are out of there. A server walks by and thanks me. I tell her thanks for the no service. I get this disgusted look. My sister gets stopped by the manager by this point me and my nephews are already in the vehicle. He tried to apologize and gave her a coupon for a free appetizer.  Too late bub! We headed over to Island burgers. Which was right down the street. We were seated promptly and our server was there almost immediately. Got our drinks ordered and the food was brought out in a timely fashion.  My burger was cooked as ordered and was delicious.  I had the Hawaiian btw. My mother ate her entire burger. She rarely finishes her meals. She had the Maui burger. Needless to say Red Robins almost soured a great afternoon with my family, thanks to Island burgers for their great services. Islands Hawaiian burger is bigger and better than Red Robins Banzai burger. I waited a day to write this cuz it would have been alot nastier. Oh yea I forgot to mention that another table walked out off Red Robins too. I will avoid this location like if it is contaminated with the ebola virus."}
{"text":"Happy Birthday to me...not at Red Robin's Stapley location. As a rewards member we Earn rewards as well as a Free Birthday burger.  I'd expect a to go order to receive the same care as dine in. However you're setting the bar to high at this location.
My bacon cheeseburger had 3times the normal recipe amount of mayo...which caused the bun to be a big ball of uneatable soggy bread.  You'd think no problem other than turning around and driving right back...
I was told by the manager as he picked through each layer of the burger while standing in the bar area that it looked like the normal recipe amount to him!
What the heck would I turn around for it weren't unacceptable to me their customer.
While I'm waiting no apologies...no worries Ken the manager finally brought my order saw my review in process then decided an apology was in order.
I love a gourmet burger but choose your Red Robin location wisely."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular places to grab a bite to eat. It's wonderful here and most of the servers are great there. Food is always hit and fresh!"}
{"text":"What a great all American restaurant.  Great atmosphere good food fair price.  John the manager and Tina one of the waitresses super nice. 
Thank you."}
{"text":"The service at this location is inconsistent to say the least. We have eaten at this location numerous times and the service is extremely hit or miss. Our last visit was on a Sunday afternoon and they weren't busy at all, yet we waited almost 45 minutes for our order. Our server was more concerned that whoever brought our appetizer out left the tray underneath than whether we received our drink order or not. It seems like we've had better service when they are super busy. We have tried to like this Red Robin, but it's been too few positive experiences too infrequently to go back."}
{"text":"Never again. I said this about my last couple Red Robin experiences, but decided to try it one more time, as this is a different location than we usually go. Server started off friendly, but that's where it ends. Took forever to get apps.  No refills.  Food (that took forever) was cold.  Basically, a high-end Denny's."}
{"text":"This was a last resort, especially with our last visit's fiasco. This visit, not quite as bad.  I give it only 3 and a half stars, mainly due to kitchen.

Came in tonight (Saturday, 5pm), hostess was very friendly, smiled, seated us right away. No problems there.

Server came over promptly, was friendly and very professional. Took drink and app orders.

Drinks- ordered no alcohol, so nothing to write about there.

Apps- chips with salsa and guac, voodoo fries.
Chips are very large and they don't give you hardly any at all. I thought they were bottomless, but I guess not. The portions of salsa and guac are tiny. Didn't even fill half of the (I'm guessing 3 oz) plastic ramiken. Voodoo fries were delicious. I had them without bacon (vegetarian). The cheese on them was delicious, and the fried jalapeño wheels really made the dish. However, again, rather small. I would not recommend sharing with more than 2 people.  However, it took forever to get to our table (right before the main course was delivered).

Dinner-
I forget which burger the fiance had, but he loved it. I bartended at a gourmet burger place owned by a celebrity chef in a casino, so even though I don't eat meat, I know what a perfect \"medium\" looks like, and they nailed it. Good size too.  He devoured it.

I had a veggie burger with Swiss, guac, lettuce, onion, mayo, and added an egg- medium hard. Burger came out and the egg was not at all cooked. I like over easy, just not the mess, but most of the WHITE of the egg was runny. (I'm like, how do you nail a perfect medium burger, and can't cook a medium egg??) Server agreed it was gross and told me she'd get me another. Again, took forever for one over-medium egg. Finally it came, and it was over-hard and overcooked. Ate it anyway. Burger was tasty. Guac is very good. Steak fries were soggy on the outside and not all the way cooked on the inside. And NO FLAVOR, whatsoever. Even after drowning it with all the sea salt and seasoning salt at the table, they could not be saved. 

Daughter had kid's mac and cheese with broccoli. She liked it. 

Ordered 2 \"Cookie Magic\" shakes to-go. They were good, but filled barely more than half of the cup.

I would like to highlight our server Kris (African American young lady). She was outstanding, deserves 5 stars. I drink A LOT of tea, and my glass was never empty. She even refilled my daughter's lemonade before it was empty (which most places ignore the kid). Automatically brought extra napkins. Very pleasant and warm, and didn't miss a beat."}
{"text":"This location is kind of dirty. I like Red Robin, and I was no prepared to be blown away, but the dishes were kinda half assed washed, the bathroom was dirty and the place was just kinda gross."}
{"text":"Place sucks! Horrible service, high priced burgers that come out like crap. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Super sweet waitress! Free burger for my bday. My 8 year old daughter loves this place so we'll be back! I have 12 week old twins and the staff was very accommodating, even opening the door when we arrived and left. Not bad for a chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"After some shopping, I was hungry and in need of some fuel. Finding a burger joint that caters to gluten-free consumers is not always easy. I walked in here with great skepticism because I thought that I would have to walk out disappointed and settle for chips and nuts somewhere. The waiter assured me and made me feel welcome. Though the burger was not the best (e.g. dry tasting bun), the service was great."}
{"text":"Lasy nite we were there about 7 pm. It so incredibly LOUD, I had to yell to be heard over the noise. I ordered the A1 pepercorn burg and my girlfriend ordered the `prime rib sandwich. There was no silverware when our food got to us.The waitress said all the utensils were dirty or havent come out of the dishwasher?  My girlfriends sandwich and the coleslaw on her plate was warm,slaw should be cold. She bit into the sandwich,had a funny look on her face and pulled out a broken toothpick. The toothpicks that were in her sandwich originally were not broken. The manager was informed about this and picked the entire check up,but we would never go back there."}
{"text":"I came here for my anniversary with my girlfriend, as we entered we both overheard a party saying \"this place had horrible service and food\" as they left. We should have immediately took this as a sign and left. However, since we are both in the food industry, we decided they were probably just overreacting. Once we were finally sat, which was a whole process in itself , it took our server Jessica over  5 minutes  before finally greeting us and offering us something to drink. By this time we had already known what to order. Our appetizer had a strange aftertaste and wasn't a good start. The food that came out was delivered to us by the manager, I ordered a \"banzai\" burger and my girlfriend ordered the \"blta croissant\" both meals came out cold, including our fries and onion rings. The fries were literally the last of the batch, the cold stale tiny bits, as the table next to us had just ordered another round, and they had to wait for fresh ones to be made. The burger was missing one of the signature ingredients, the pineapple. Naturally we were both upset considering we came here to celebrate an anniversary. I flagged down the waiter and explained to her our situation. She was very self-absorbed and had no empathy. I explained to her that while I understand you can't control what comes out of the kitchen, but for the cooks, the expo and the manager all to neglect the product and serve cold food was upsetting. She rude fully commented that \"we are busy, sorry. If it was me bringing the food out I would have caught the mistake.\" Also told us that she couldn't tell the expo anything because they used to be a manager and was scared too. She didn't offer anything for the inconvenience, nor did she offer to have the manager come over to discuss. Very displeased with the service and food. Highly recommend that individuals stay as far away from this location as possible."}
{"text":"We normally have fantastic service at this Red Robin. Went tonight and ordered 2 salads, had LEXI as a waitress she took our order then we sat there for 40 minutes, she never once checked on us. We finally had to ask the host to check on our salads, still Lexi never came back. Finally one of the guys from the kitchen came out apologizing and trying to recite our order and getting it wrong. Still Lexi did not come over to apologize.  Absolutely worst service ever, actually we received no service while watching many others get seated and receive their food.  Red Robin hire people who care about customer service. She was terrible!  We left with no food."}
{"text":"Service was decent food was adequate,bottomless fries?? Not really... Had to ask twice and when they showed up there was 12 fries on a big plate, like they lost half the fries on the way over to my table"}
{"text":"Burgers have been pretty decent lately, but seriously, fuck kids night. It's still bullshit they portion the steak fries. It isn't \"bottomless\" if you portion shit out, and have to be asked more than once for refills. Why not just give more the first time?!?!?"}
{"text":"Red Robin often bills itself as a family friendly restaurant, however this location is anything but. Specifically designed to partition families into a separate area of the restaurant, making it noisier louder and in general much poorer experience. Servers are more stressed, service is slower, equipment that has been pointed out before on previous visits has never been fixed (such as broken lights).  Find it a bit disrespectful to be segregated to a run-down corner of the restaurant just because we have children. We pay the same prices as everyone else, so I would expect the same courtesy and service. This establishment is not recommended if you have families. Other Red Robin locations in Las Vegas area are better suited, like the location at the Galleria mall."}
{"text":"Red Robn is one of my favorite places to eat. Wings and dipping sauces are the best I've had. My family also enjoys burgers and chicken dish. We eat here monthly and for a while their fries that came with the meal were often soggy, yet if you ordered more, they were fantastic I'm grateful that the last 5 times the fries have been perfectly crisp on the outside. I think they have it down now. Yay! Cuz I love the fries!
Service has always been pleasant even with my special requests."}
{"text":"Their reverse happy hour is good if your hungry late in the evening. Usual appetizers. Nothing special."}
{"text":"We went to Red Robin to celebrate my daughter's birthday using her free hamburger coupon.  We did not have a printed version of this coupon because we exceed the allotted times we could view it.  We had an email on my husband's phone and he said he would honor it.  When the bill arrived it was not taken off and when we questioned it. the server said his manager needed a printed copy??  We were so annoyed as we had asked before hand if this was a problem.  The Red Robin Royalty card has never worked well for us, registration issues, not getting our hamburgers counted, etc. and now this.  
The food was fine, but it was very overpriced.  It was $55 for 4 burgers and drinks.  It should of been less but they wouldn't honor the birthday burger coupon.  
We will not return."}
{"text":"The food was not only amazing but our server was outstanding. His name was Adrian and he made sure we received exceptional service. I am allergic to dairy (sadly) and he went the extra mile to show me the allergen app menu so that I could order exactly what I wanted. He was awesome! Will def be going back soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The food was out in no time and the bottomless fries are definitely a plus. Would recommend to anyone trying to get a good burger and fries."}
{"text":"This place is crap. Went there for lunch today with a friend of mine. FOUND A DAMN HAIR IN MY FOOD.. So nasty, told management about it & was pretty upset.. When I got the check.. Had not received a discount for the mistake! Aren't they supposed to wear hair nets? Hair in someone's food.. So nasty. I will NEVER be back. Total waste of money on food that hair in it and was burnt! Do not go to this location they are HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"Honestly not sure why people are so addicted to this chain. I've avoided this chain since my visit awhile ago, and with good reason.

To start off, we went around 9pm, to find ourselves waiting for a table. We were told 15 minutes and it took 30, which is fine, since sometimes things come up.

We got the onion rings, which were pretty good. Kind of a comfort food, nothing particularly that someone would crave for, but not bad. Took 20 minutes or so to arrive I do believe. 

I ordered the garden burger with a side of endless fruit. We had several endless fries as well.

Now, where to begin. Service was s-l-o-w. The garden burger was cold, dry, and the patty was beyond consumption, literally. It had massive bites taken into it, and was hard as a rock. 

My endless fruit was fruit preserves, likely because nothing there is fresh, and was never refilled.

In fact, none of the fries were refilled without taking several minutes to wave down the servers, which were not particularly attentive. 

The sweet potato fries were terrible. Not only were they soggy and cold, but we sent them back 5 times to have the same disappointment. We told them this to only have them say \"they get cold fast\". 

Honestly, go spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner on a Friday night it was busy but we got seated quickly. The drinks and appetizers were good. The burgers took longer then we thought. Overall we had a good evening!"}
{"text":"Service was poor today. Asked the server for crayons for my daughter, which never arrived. Server seemed disconnected and food took longer than usual to arrive at table. Had no silverware when my salad arrived. Requested vinegar twice. Manager did come to check on this one through the meal because I think he knew we were frustrated, but by then we were over everything. Please get it together."}
{"text":"I must admit, I am in love with the bottomless basket of fries and dipping them in either honey mustard or ranch dressing. If you want to dare yourself, then get a shake too. You also won't go wrong with a bowl of clam chowder. The staff is friendly and the place is always clean. Plus, if you go on-line and join their newsletter, you will get a free burger on your birthday."}
{"text":"They were really crowded, but we still got seated in a little under the 10 mins wait they said we'd have.  The waitress was really good, kept checking up on us (despite how busy they were), refilled our drinks multiple times, etc.   Been here 8-10 times over the last 2 years or so, plan to keep returning."}
{"text":"Place looks like a truck stop burger joint..dirty...I've received better service at the eastern location..ordered guacamole burger & barely had guacamole in it..used my free birthday burger which was awesome but, still got charged..never coming to this location again!!!Only one server serving one area on Saturday night..bad service..."}
{"text":"Honestly the most 'meh' experience I've ever had at a chain restaurant, not counting McDonald's. The food was incredibly bland and the waitress couldn't have cared less about us or her job."}
{"text":"We are here for lunch at red robin. The burger was mediocre and the bun was not wrap so it's soggy . I mentioned to the waiter about the soggy bun, she said we can ask for the paper wrap. The place is not clean, dusty and notable on shades and lamps."}
{"text":"This location never seems to get it right. I like to say good things about Red Robin, but I can't here. From overdone burgers time after time again (Seriously, I've sent the same burger back 3 times and it still comes well done dry a flavorless)  to lousy service and unattentive wait staff, to an argumentative manager who's only concern last night was if I cussed in front of his server. Our server got us drinks, appetizer and even our entrees quick enough...but then never returned for nearly a half hour. Wouldn't change the TV to let us watch the local baseball game, no refills on iced tea, no refill on fries, no extra ranch or dipping sauce, and no care about it when I called her out. Just, \"I'll get my manager.\" And everyone in our section was doing the same scan around looking for her. Drive 4 miles east to the 103rd Ave location."}
{"text":"My friends and I went this past weekend before the special ed prom we were going to. They are very accommodating. We also all had a food allergy and they were able to make something for everyone! There is nothing better than the bottomless fries! Wonderful place and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Red Robin is one of our favorite burger joints for the family.  It's typically busy at this location, especially on the weekends.  Our wait this visit was less than a half hour though.  The chain looks like they've been busy upgrading the decor at all their locations.  The new look is a little retro and is unique and fun.  Our food was delivered timely and tasted great."}
{"text":"Awesome bleu burger with jalapeño cornbread bun! On time service too."}
{"text":"Our server was fantastic and meal was great! Our server Jaime was very attentive polite and made this a great experience. However, will not be returning to this location due to the management that was on staff last night. Manager on duty, Rhonda, was VERY unprofessional when we complained about another server telling someone to \"shut the $&@! up and do what I'm telling you too\". Instead she reprimanded OUR server who did nothing and threatened to write her up in FRONT of us. Other servers apologized for the foul language in front of our 6 year old son but the server who cussed was not reprimanded OR apologetic. Again, our server Jaime was amazing! If you go in there make sure you sit in her section! 

Ps upper management was awesome when I made a formal complaint :) may just go back there because of the way upper management handled the situation."}
{"text":"Burgers, Fries and Mud Pie. I mean...YUMMMMMMM. We have always been lucky with awesome servers and a special shout out goes to Brianne!! She's always above and beyond! :)"}
{"text":"Brand new, beer on tap, fast service! Bar is usually empty, has 2 tv's and comfy seats."}
{"text":"Since they cleaned house and have a new manager (who is fantastic by the way) my family goes here often. The prices are decent and the servers are great. I gave five stars because the last two times my family has been there, it has been awesome!!"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience today with the employee seating people. We went to sit in the bar area like we have done the entire time this place has been open and the guy that was getting names for tables rudely approached me and my family. Immediately he checked my sons age, which wasn't an issue and then proceeded to instruct us on the Red Robins rules. Funny thing is, there was two tables open at that time."}
{"text":"Red Robin! Yummmmm! A fairly standard experience when it comes to chain restaurants. Very enjoyable experience with a friendly staff and good food."}
{"text":"Sing it with me......REEED ROBIN.....YUM! ;)

Oohhh my goodness....my brain can't think because it is SOO LOUD IN HERE!  Now I remember why back in the days I would bring my baby here.  Because no matter how loud she screams no one notices. LOL  I think its so loud that you actually have to yell to communicate with the person you are with so its all an ugly vicious cycle. 

Sunday afternoon we decided on a burger-lunch and thought it had been so long since we had been here.  Now we remember why. hahah The waiting area was full but must have been for a large party because our party of 2 got seated right away.  Every seat in this place was full.  Tons of large parties full of families and friends!  Maybe the after-church crowds as well.  So much I forgot about this place-not a frequent favorite just for the fact there aren't too many healthy options here.  If you can control yourself they do serve salads.  I'm just not sure how healthy they are since I'm not the one who can order salad with a menu that has fantastic pictures enticing your blurred and echoing thinking.  

We were literally seated for less than 5 minutes when our waitress came to apologize for the wait.  Wait?  What wait?  Very nice girl but a little ditsy.  I don't generally go for burgers anywhere.  I usually opt for the grilled chicken for a healthier choice.  Today I was going all out.  Here's what we ordered:

Whisky BBQ burger - slightly greasy bun, topped with a juicy on the inside burger with crispy onion strings and a smoky bbq sauce.  Yes I didn't go for the lowest in calorie/fat option.  It was pretty great though.  I had to cut it in fourths so I could actually eat it in a nice non-messy way.  My once a year indulgence didn't fail me...er-until just now.....SHOW STOPPER....  Might I say how disgusted I am now that I looked at the nutritional value of this burger....Oh my freakin gawd......1138 calories 70 grams of fat!  HOLY SHIT!  My hour workout that night didn't even put a dent in that!  (not even funny right now) Sniff sniff.....Tear.

to continue....BF ordered a regular cheese burger with mustard and crispy onion strings.  He said it was the best he's had in a long time.  He ordered a side of coleslaw and loved it.

....and don't forget the \"bottomless steakfries\"...its what they advertise on TV.  ...and I am not even looking at the nutritional value of these! God help me here!  I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of steak fries but I ate a few anyway.  I've seen other reviews about the seasoning on the tables.  Nothing (at all) special to me.  The fries are dry anyway and the seasoning doesn't even stick.  So \"eh\" on the fries. Maybe I will substitute them next time-FOR SALAD (disgusted still).  BTW we didn't need bottomless as there were plenty that we didn't finish....Thank God!

Customer service is outstanding.  The manager checked on our table several times.  Drinks never ran low and our server was super attentive in the midst of her many other tables.  I am often amazed when someone can juggle all that and still be pleasant and attentive.  I know.  Yes agreed...that's how it should be.

Overall the place is fun, loud and perfect to bring your really boisterous family and friends to clog their arteries!  Enjoy THAT would ya!  =)"}
{"text":"I always love red Robin their burgers are really good this experience was no exception I had the black and blue burger which was wonderful the bottom with sweet potato fries are the way to go with honey mustard to dip them in.  I would definitely go back here I love how they have redone all the restaurants"}
{"text":"I am over and done with Red Robin. They were going to call me, no call so wrote again, they said they would call and then I had a problem with my house phones. Had that taken care of and informed them on December 4th Cox had fixed the phone and they replaced the modem.  TWELVE days ago, So for the last time Do NOT call me. I will never ever go into a Red Robin again.  If you call I shall hang up. I do not want to hear from or see a Red Robin again. Red Robin used to be a good go to every time but reading review I see they are failing in may ways, To bad,"}
{"text":"First time for a bad review. And I want to say I do miss the Red Robin on Decatur.  I do not get to RR as much as I would have liked because they are all a distance from me anymore. So when I go to Doctor on that side of town I try to get there. Only once about 10 years ago I had a bad experience with them and up until yesterday they have always been the greatest in every way,
Walked before 4pm, was mostly deserted. A first for anytime I have been to any RR. We were seated and then had to wait a bit before we were asked what we would like to drink, me? Iced tea, my guest coffee.My tea cam and it looked like a drop of color was added to water. NO TEA. So called server and he said he would get some from another station which was not really much better. Should have just had water. My guest was still waiting for his coffee. We had decided what we were going to have, mine always the Seafood Scatter. My guest chose a burger, Finally his coffee came. Long wait and we were finally served. My guest, his burger he said was good, We needed more napkins  and finally got a bus boy to get us some.My shrimp and clam strips were good but when I bit into the cod it was like a piece of gristle, The cod pieces were VERY small any way. I had fished a good part of my life off the CA coast for every cod imaginable and this was truly BLAH. Fries were not many and at no time were we asked if we wanted more fries. That has never happened before. Nor were we asked for or got a refill on coffee or tea. Almost 3$ for a drink of watered tea. By that time I was to tired and not happy and did not want to create a scene even tho there were not many to hear me if I did. The server put the bill on the table. I asked for a to go box and most of the time when the servers see there are NO MORE fries they will add a few. But not the time. There fries are excellent if you can get any.  Well I got the bill ready and waited and waited and again flagged a bus boy and asked for out server. He came and we paid the bill. Took the teeny pieces of cod with NO fires home. Normally I will snack on my doggie bag in the evening, Got the teeny piece and a half home and a couple hours later decided to have it. The cod was tough!!!!!!!!! First time in my life I have had tough cod and I am 78 years old and fished for years. Was barely a bite in the  piece to just tossed in garbage disposal. 
Extremely disappointed and will not go back and I cannot count the times I have been to Red Robins and in the past so looked forward to the seafood platter,
Should have turned into In'N\"Out just down the street. Never, ever been disappointed there."}
{"text":"Not liking Red Robin is analogous to not liking freedom. It's a good burger at a good price. It's family friendly: arcade games, TVs, and the 'Red' bird mascot will bring a smile to people of all ages. I've gone for many years and I won't be stopping anytime."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times but this was my best visit yet because of the server! His name was Ryan and he was on top of everything from drinks to food. Incredibly fast, very good at his job!"}
{"text":"For a chain, this place really tickled my fancy. Not so impressed by the food, per say, but the wait staff was exceptional. I have never seen such hard working individuals before. 

I can't remember her name, but our server was a female with a huge bun on her head. She rocked it! She not only was waiting on our table, but a few others and tending to the entire bar!

Our food was decent, but the service is the reason I will be back. Thank you mystery server, you really mad my night!"}
{"text":"Every time we go the experience is either good or poor, wether its the food, service or both. There are too many other resturants in town that are consistant."}
{"text":"great place for the kiddies! food is always consistant here. staff is very friendly.  one of few good chain resaurants left."}
{"text":"Like their burgers and chicken sandwiches.  Pretty consistent.  Never disappoints me.  Wasn't busy but still had to wait 10 min.  Otherwise service was good."}
{"text":"Got there about 5:00 p.m. on a Sunday, No waiting for seating and they were very fast on taking the order. The waiter checked-in on us during the dinner to make sure we were fine (Food, Drinks, Ect.) and then we got the check in a timely matter. Great place if you have a young one!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, Red Robin is delicious! However, if you want to use delivery set your expectations low. The last time we ordered delivery we got a call from grub hub saying that our order wasn't correct (it was missing a meal) and that the restaurant was making it now. Well eventually our delivery got to us and everything except the meal that they had to correct was ice cold. Obviously they made the meal while the other items sat in a bag. We called grub hub and the restaurant right away and they refunded the cost of the cold meals well guess what? We open the container for the only hot meal we received and it was WRONG. LOL it was funny and not funny at the same time and wasn't even worth calling back about. Fast forward to tonight and we place an order. 30 min later our grub hub driver is nice enough to call and say that our order is still not ready at Red Robin. We say it's cool bc we know it's a holiday weekend. Order arrives and again it's WRONG. Blatantly missing items. All that being said the food was good. That's why it's unfortunate because this is poor management not poor quality. Anyway, from now on we will probably pick the order up ourselves."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusted with my visit here tonight. Our server was terrific and did the best she could while the computers were down, however the surrounding servers were horrible. I had a toddler in a chair and an infant in a sling. One server cut between two tables multiple times almost knocking my child on the ground, so we had to put her in a high chair to prevent her from getting hurt. Same thing with my infant, a server cut between two tables next to her and brought two trays full of food over the top of her head. Then the server who brought our food was standing over the top of my infant with a tray of food, and did not move even when we said something. After all of this we went to talk to the manager and all he did was apologize, no coaching to his servers, he acted like it was no big deal that his servers could have injured both of my young children. We will never go here again. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"The food was fair our burger bun falling apart the waitress was with her noise in the air thought she is better then working at red robins it's a special offering bottomless fries never asked if we wanted more rude! Waitress Stacy you just hurt your tips"}
{"text":"I can say with all honesty, Red Robin makes a decent burger.  I think I've never had a lousy burger no matter what choice I ordered.  I'd give them higher marks except for the following.....

Noise level.  I don't know who designs the buildings, but the acoustics are horrid in here.  It's louder than a bus for of screaming infants on the way to visit the doctor.  No matter when I've went there, I've had to scream at others in my party to carry on a conversation.

\"Bottomless\" fries.  Here's a thought.  Bring out enough fries from the start.  My last trip I had 7 fries in my chrome fry tube.  Seriously.  7.  I wasn't sure if they didn't have any left, or if the chef was hinting that i could lose a few lbs.  I wanted more fries, but you would have a better chance finding Kim Kardashian's virginity, before you found our waiter.

Attentive wait staff.  You are here to work, not talk about your date tonight, flirt with co- workers or stand and look out the window.   How about you check on your guests.  Ask them if they want refills (fries and soda) and maybe grab a mop and bucket and keep the place clean.  Another problem here is the condition of the place.

The saving grace there are the burgers. Very good, and if you can deal with the loud noise and ho-hum service, you'll go away full."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a clear disappointment! It's like a bad mix of Cheesecake Factory meets McDonalds; book style bounded menu with \"out of the freezer\" taste. The burger are not fresh to the point where we compared it to gas station flavored food. The hook of getting you in this place are the \"bottomless sides\" where guest are free to reorder endless side items like fries. The kids menus are reasonable since it includes sides and a drink (up charge for specialty sides/drinks). I cannot think why one would choose this place over the likes of Bad Daddy's where the burgers are priced the same with better taste. This truly will be the last time we would even think of going to again. The service was good so there was a bright side."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the food was great too!!! First time at this Red Robin. I was in Charlotte for Nascar and glad we stopped here. 4 different staff came by to make sure we were good. That's how you run a place of business"}
{"text":"(Update at bottom) 
I don't think I've had a worse tasting guacamole bacon burger. 

We made a to go order. I arrived a few minutes after the scheduled pick up time (approx 30 minutes after we ordered), waited an additional 30 minutes to get the food. It's a 5 minute drive back to my house and in the 7 minutes it took to drive home and unload, all our food was stone cold. I'm pretty reluctant to believe that it went from piping hot to stone cold in a matter of minutes. It honestly tasted like it had been left sitting & waiting for the 30 minutes I waited to even get the food. 

Overall, everything was highly unimpressive. My mom and stepdad ordered the simple burger and both said it was just okay. Huge disappointment to pay $10 for a burger comparable to something you'd get from McDonalds or Wendy's. 

And then my guacamole bacon burger. I'm not sure why they say it has guacamole in it, I couldn't even taste it. I could barely tell it had guacamole on it. The bacon was subpar. I asked for pickles, they weren't on it. And again, it was stone cold by the time we got to eat it. Not warm in the slightest. Completely cold. Which is odd since I've ordered take out often enough to have experienced that it doesn't usually get cold after less than 10 minutes. 

Overall, it was a complete waste of an hour and $50. I wish I had just run to the grocery store and gotten stuff to make burgers myself. Not only would we have eaten sooner, but it would have tasted far better. Also, since it appears no one from the restaurant actually checks the Yelp reviews, I plan on calling the restaurant and sharing my experience. I will update with what they say.

UPDATE: I did call & speak with a manager. She was very kind & listened intently as I explained my experience. She offered to send a gift card to cover the cost of our meal so we can try it again. She did say that it was unusual for food to be cold & acknowledged the long wait. I very much appreciate the gesture and we will try it again. I will update my review after we try it again. Since the review was about the food specifically & not the service, I won't be changing it at this time. But maybe when we trying it again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience today. I felt as if the waitress and managers were accusing me of not paying my bill. The waitress and managers claimed they could not find my payment and printed out pages worth of payments to prove me wrong.   Come to find out, I was also overcharged. The waitress charged me for another tables bill, then claimed she had no idea how that happened.  Once they found my payment, the gave me a lame ass excuse and apology.. Like that was going to make up for the embarrassment and harassment they put me through. Not to mention, I was offered a free dessert.  WTF makes you think I want dessert after what you just put me through.  Just refund me my money and I will not be back.. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Only giving two starts because the food is decent. Service is absolutely horrible, food is overpriced for what you get. Oh and it took me 40 minutes to get a cup of soup during lunch when there were a total of 5 other people in the whole restaurant. Never again"}
{"text":"Delicious fish burger, bottomless steak fries, the best Mai Tai (a large food chain could offer) and great service, what more could you ask for? Sometimes you'll even catch Red Robin when he makes an appearance."}
{"text":"This place has gone way down hill. My knife and fork were brought to me and they were filthy with bits of lettuce stuck on them. Waiter failed to ask how I wanted my burger cooked and it came out dry on a bun that was stale and crumbled when I picked it up. They sent out a blackened and burnt grilled cheese for my kiddo on chipped/broken dishes. Nobody came to the table to check on us or really apologize. I won't be back. 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Great service too! Morgan was our waitress, she was very sweet and very helpful! We were sat right under the AC vent but she was very helpful in making sure we weren't too cold, she even turned the air down for us. Food was delicious! Nothing to complain about!"}
{"text":"The Love burger is the Best burger I have ever had! Garlic fries is the way to go. Not too fond of the sweet potato fries. Found A New burger place!"}
{"text":"Gross.  Everything was sticky.  Miss,  you work here.  Please wash your hands anger you use the potty. Never again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Tuesday I would say the food was pretty good my fries were nice and hot and burger was great too. However the service sucked I felt like I kept asking our server for everything....\"can I get a refill\" \"can I get more fries\" \" our check please and a to go box\". She was so unfriendly maybe she was having a bad day."}
{"text":"Walked in seated right away. Not busy at all. No server came by. Got up to leave and the nitwit hostess tells us \"have a good day\". This location has always been a disappointment. Will not be back."}
{"text":"My family and I love Red Robin,we have been going there for over 10 yrs and will probably keep going!the burgers and fries taste great,service is good it could be better,but that was just one person,she seemed like she didn't want to be there and we were bothering her,but that was the first time in years.And free refills on soda for the kids and those who don't drink."}
{"text":"The waitress was great.  She was attentive and nice.  I was there with two 7year old picky eaters. I did ask her to go ahead and put the kids order in and not wait for my order since they knew exactly what they wanted.   That didn't happen.  I ordered my burger well done (no pink).  My food came out the same time as the kids even though there was about 10 minutes between orders.  My food was luke warm at best and medium well.  I did not send it back.  I was taught to never complain and send food back.  It was ok. I ate it anyway.  I will eat a steak medium well but not usually burgers.  I'm not too eager to go back.  The kids didnt complain about anything."}
{"text":"We used to enjoy this chain and this particular location, but the food quality and the service have been poor over our past several visits. Today's visit was the worst it's been and I don't anticipate us returning again. 

I also really dislike the table screen devices. We are there to hang out as a family, not to fight over screen time."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this location but my last 2 visits have been terrible. The bar is slow, took 15 minutes to get a draft beer and the kitchen has been \"behind\" according to the wait staff. Burgers came out a little above room temperature with cold fries.... I'd order more fries but they would just take another 15 minutes. Waiters insist on you ordering and paying from the tablet on the table. 

Did this place change managers or something because there has been a big dip in quality recently."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Husbands beer was in a dirty glass. Food took awhile to get to us and once we got it, it was disgusting. He ordered a patty melt and it was rock hard and dried out like it was sitting up on the counter under a heat lamp forever. 
Sent the sandwich back and got a side salad in instead."}
{"text":"Worst food, and worst service.  Will never go back to Red Robin.  Do not waste your time and money.  It is horrible."}
{"text":"Conveniently located, we hit this place on occasion for a meal where no one can decide where to go.  It's not bad, but the menu is bereft of anything under a zillion calories, which generally leaves me eating soup. Burgers/fries are the rule of the day, but for the love of god, stop the birthday singing.
Forget the drinks- they're ridiculously expensive."}
{"text":"Won't visit this location again. Worst customer service at a restaurant ever! There was hardly anyone in there yet it took a good 10 minutes before we were even greeted while waiting to be seated. Then they put us at a table surrounded by dirty tables. Never cleaned them up. Our waitress, Sonia, was dragging her feet the whole time! Never cleared the empty appetizer dishes from the table... I had to! Drink refills? Nope! Bottomless root-beer float? I got one refill that I had to stop the waitress and ask for. The fries were cold and stale. Like I mentioned, the worst service I've experienced!

On a positive note, my whiskey burger was good."}
{"text":"Nearing the end of a 4 day work week, which has seemed to drag on twice as long, a couple of co-workers and I were in need of a Friday afternoon attitude adjustment.  A quick survey on Buzzfeed, claiming to tell you what you were in the mood for for lunch, led us to the local Red Robin.  Before I get to Red Robin, let me say whoever is writing the algorithms at Buzzfeed deserves a raise because they were spot on.  Now on to Red Robin.  Red Robin is the perfect example of the old addage \"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\"  I had this place pegged all wrong. From the moment you walk in the door you are treated like family.  John, our waiter, was having a rough day with a malfunctioning credit card machine, but if you think that changed his care and attentiveness, think again.  When he came to take our orders, I went with the Madlove burger.  Talk about fun.  If a burger topped with bacon, avacado, and onion strings is something that gets your taste buds tingling I strongly recommend this, if not read through the menu and pick out something that makes your mouth water.  A co-worker summed up my first Red Robin experience perfectly \"this beats a freaking salad any day.\"  On the door Red Robin proudly hangs a sign that reads \"You'll be Happy Here,\" what they forgot to mention is how sad you'll be to leave.  Until next Red Robin, I thank you."}
{"text":"This place charged my debit card twice over 6 weeks!  This place is a rip-off and management could care less.  I will never trust this Red Robin or any other location again."}
{"text":"Went to the soft opening and the service was terrible, and food was mediocre.  But felt like I couldn't complain because it was free.

Went back today, and the service was excellent (or so I thought) and the food was fresh and excellent.  Then, I received my bill.  I ordered a margarita and a sangria off the all day happy hour drink menu for $5.50, however on the bill I was charged $7.99.  After I inquired, I was told that it was because I ordered a \"Signature Margarita\", because I got a flavor. 

I was a little confused, because the menu says $5.50 Margaritas - and when I ordered I said \"can I get a mango margarita - with this\" and was told yes.  I would have thought at that point - the water would have said something about a $2.49 upcharge for the Mango flavor."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go if you have kids and need something more substantial than Peter Piper or McDonalds.  The place caters to families, the food is always good, they have a full bar, and this one also has an acceptable tap beer selection.  I have always been pleased with the service here.  We were there this past Saturday, the place was very busy but all of the wait staff were pleasant even though they were really hustling."}
{"text":"Just left there without eating because our server was too busy talking to a table of people she knew and never even acknowledged us.  We sat there for almost 20 minutes just waiting for water or some acknowledgement, but got nothing.  Several tables right near us that arrived after us already had their drinks and put in their order with a different waitress.  On the way I stopped to tell the hostess who said \"I'm really sorry.  Have a good night\".  Very disappointed in the service, the number of tables that had dirty dishes on them, etc."}
{"text":"I was here tonight by myself seated in the bar area.  There was one server working this area and the service absolutely sucked.  I had the worse service at any red robin in my life.  Took forever for the food and there was no one here.  Had to wait forever to get a refill on my drink as well.  Wish a member of management would have stopped by to ask me how my experience was but no such luck.  Never again red robin."}
{"text":"We stopped in here yesterday for lunch. Our waiter was fantastic, I wish I could remember his name but I do remember his nametag said he was a trainer. I ordered a side of Mac and cheese for my 10 month old to eat and our waiter brought it out with our appetizer knowing that it is difficult to keep an infant preoccupied. He was quick with re-fills and very friendly. My mother in law and I had salads and they were very fresh, the kids had kids meals and they were what to be expected. Having quick friendly service is something that I look for when taking the kids out to eat. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have always loved red robin. I have been hooked ever since I was a little kid. The first burger I ever fell in love with here was the guacamole bacon burger. Then I found the royal burger. This was my favorite for years until they changed the recipe. I know they changed the egg and it tastes like the changed something else because even when I ask for it the \"old way\" it doesn't taste the same. Now I don't come back as often and have no desire for a burger even when I do come here because that turned me off so much. Hope they figure it out as they use to be the best."}
{"text":"Poor service - had to ask for host to send someone over for drink order after 7-10 mins. Food not hot. Worst experience I've had at a Red Robin. Avoid this one."}
{"text":"Good service and of course the food is bomb. Only thing I can complain about is, we sat at the bar, the bar tender was a chick and had a SUPER THICK mustache and it was grossing me out while we ate. She spat a little while she was talking to us which didn't make it any better. Any other time we come here we sit in the regular seating area and I think we will stick with that from now on."}
{"text":"Neither me or my husband are into online reviews or anything of the sort because people take it way too seriously but we wanted to go ahead and share how awesome this location is each and every time that we are in. We always sit in the bar because we are over 21 and we love how they changed that rule so that we don't have to worry about sitting next to children. The bartenders are always on point and gives us great service. We always come in at night and the bartenders are usually either a man named Adrian or a man named Mike. They are both outstanding at their jobs but Mike is the best bartender or server that we've experienced at any restaurant. He is so friendly and so quick and to watch him make all those drinks and serve all the tables that he is serving is really something to watch. We were in this last Wednesday and he seemed to have a pretty big group of regulars that was sitting next to the window that were drinking pretty heavily and while sometimes one specific guy that was in the group was getting pretty loud and obnoxious he was hilarious and very entertaining. The whole bar was filled up and we still never had to ask for anything ever. Mike even noticed that we had stopped eating and brought us boxes and kids for the sauces to take home. It's very impressive that he notices the little things like that and is one of the many reasons we continue to done at this location. I love drinking the mai tai while I'm in there because it is not too strong and not too weak. it's always just so perfect and comes in that cool little glass. We will continue to come into this location because it is by far better than the other locations that we've been into for Red Robin and the service is just always so great. Again Mike is so awesome and we look forward to date night every week at this location and hope to see him when we're in the next time but to know we'll still get great service if he is not there is a pretty big bonus. If anyone reading this is looking for a recommendation on a burger I strongly recommend the black and blue burger or the Lone Star Burger. They are both outstanding."}
{"text":"I used to work at Red Robin and, every once in a while, I get a craving for their burgers. I have been to this location a few times and it has always been fine but this is the first time I have returned since the branding has changed to try to reflect a more upscale atmosphere. The changes are, sadly, not good. I already groaned when they insisted on now calling their \"chipotle mayo\" \"chipotle aoli.\" Clearly \"aoil\" costs more than \"mayo\" so that's a reason why the prices have gone up. In addition, the \"garlic fries\" that come with an upcharge used to have real garlic on them but now come with a simple seasoning. Additionally, our fries that came with the burger were cold, so we asked for fresh fries. When we received those, they were cold, as well. When we followed up they insisted thay they were taken out fresh. If that is he case, there is something seriously wrong with the equipment. We spoke with the manager but he did not seem to care and did not offer any real consolation and treated us as if we were just being difficult. Needless to say, when I need to get my Red Robin fix in the future, it will be elsewhere."}
{"text":"Shasta was absolutely brilliant.  She knew exactly what we needed for dietary needs and assisted in ordering them. She kept up on drinks and food. Definitely deserves a pay raise. 

The bathroom could use some attention. One out of three sinks worked and the locks on the stalls were broken. 

Other than that the food was good. Service was great."}
{"text":"I went here with my sister for a quick bite to eat and the food was just eh-OK. The server was wearing so much cologne that all I could taste was that. If you want to go somewhere that has no wait and mediocre food go here."}
{"text":"I stopped by. Got a couple of burgers togo. The burgers r always great. Its pretty bad when the fries are like sticks of wood. The 2 go together the quality should be a duo. Next time i will make sure. I don't get the crappy. I don't care its a togo order fries. From the cooks."}
{"text":"I had a burger and VooDoo Fries my wife had their Cobb salad to go.  It was ok, I'm not a fan of charbroiled meat if it's grilled at home it doesn't have that Burger King (fake) taste.  Sorry BK.
It was a nice size and cooked just like I asked for but for an hour all I could taste was that fake charcoal taste. 

I'm a fan of burgers on the grill either gas or charcoal, this was disappointing!  

My wife loved her salad, guess I shoulda followed her lead! LoL 

Ben"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come eat!, I learned about bottomless fries by aronda,  who by the way has a great sense of humor! The restaurant was very clean. Thank goodness jill  wasn't working today, she's the worst....lol I'd recommend family nd friends to eat here..restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Honestly this Red Robin is a joke. The service is always horrible and disappointing. So we got here around 9:30 PM on a Saturday night. It was just my sister and I. The place was pretty empty and I saw about twelve servers upon entering. They sat us down. About 15 minutes later the waiters as finally comes to get our drinks. When she comes back ten minutes later with the two drinks we order. It took 30 minutes for two burgers. What the hell? The place isn't even busy. So the waiter finally brings the food and I ask for my side of ranch. The waitress actually had the nerve to roll her eyes. It was her fault she couldn't bring it out with the food. I bite into my burger to find its cold and over cooked. I ask for a manger immediately. She comes over and is looking at me like I'm an alien. She kept asking if I was sure. She finally agrees to remake the burger. I got a new burger which was better but still had to pay full price. The service was horrible and everyone was rude."}
{"text":"We done at this RR a lot and we like it!  Several of the waiters know us when we walk in and they already know our order!  It is pricey but the food is really yummy!"}
{"text":"While Red Robin has a wide variety of your standard bar type food, I had to write this review to give MAJOR KUDOS to what is probably the best waitress I've ever had. Thank you PAIGE for making this a wonderful meal out for my husband and I."}
{"text":"Back to 1 star.  I walk in and it's a couple of minutes wait, ok fine. Two more couples come in.  A complete idiot manager (not the gals currently hosting) comes up and seats the last couple to come in.  I'm pissed. Completely insincere apology.  We leave. 

If you are going to use an iPad to check in people use the fucking thing to check whom to seat."}
{"text":"I order delivery from post mates today, not knowing what to expect. They completely ruined my burger by taking off key ingredients. It seemed as though they wiped off ingredients they had put on by mistake. If I would have been at the restaurant I would of sent back this burger. It was a complete let down. I will not eat or order from this location EVER again."}
{"text":"I don't see what the big deal about this place. My first time to red robin was less than impressive. Our poor waitress was overworked and very forgetful. The food was subpar. I won't be going back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Burgers were good, endless fries were good ( the garlic and herb ) we had a big party ? Of 12, got here at 3:45 , done eating and we have all been waiting for our checks for 45 minutes .Trying to leave and it is now 6:00, the waitress came out multiple times asking what we all had . Very frustrating experience, manager was very apologetic and gave us a break on the bill and coupons for free appetizer, but we will not return . Should not take 3 hours for lunch . #lunchhostages
#shouldhavewalked"}
{"text":"The one consistent theme at this location is horrible service.  We have been here at least 10 times, mostly because our little one liked their food, but I can't remember a time when the service was great or even average. Interestingly, in reading many of the other less than stellar reviews here, the common complaint is POOR SERVICE.  Get a clue RR!!"}
{"text":"The meal was absolutely wonderful and the service was great.  Jasmine was wonderful and very helpful with everything.  I was even able to take a bottle of seasoning home with their permission.  I will be definitely going
 back."}
{"text":"Just left here after being sat for over ten minutes without a server approaching us. The dining area was only half full and even that is being generous. I have been to this location three times now and have had an issue each time. Last time they messed up our order, and the time before that they gave us the wrong check. Save your time and sanity and go to the location at Centennial."}
{"text":"We just went there tonight. Take out. Amy helped us on the phone and when we picked up. Best customer service!!! I'm huge with how people treat me and she went above and beyond w her customer service skills. I hope if the manager reads this... they do a little something extra for her!!"}
{"text":"I'm briefly breaking my rule about reviewing chains simply because the service at this particular location is always top of the line. The crew always smiles and seems to legitimately enjoy their work location, and takes good care of us while we dine but not in an intrusive way. That makes me happy.

That is all; carry about your business, good Yelper."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Red Robin when I lived in CA. Visited the one in Arrow Head several times. Very happy that they are closer now."}
{"text":"Got here shortly after it opened everyone was really nice and prompt food was delicious and drinks were cold. Highly recommended to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Dear Yelp... half stars....pleeeeeeease!

Anyways, I would give this 2.5 stars, back in the day it was definitely a 4.  I am not sure what is going on here, but the quality has definitely gone down A LOT in the past year or so.  

The quality of the food is hit and miss... usually leading more towards the miss.  Salad isn't as tasty as it used to be, meat quality is lower, and don't even bother with the seafood.... the freezer section has had better outcomes. 

The service has really taken a dive recently.  The staff barely makes an appearance some visits.  Their happy hour has gone from fairly decent to totally ridiculous!  They don't have any apps on the HH menu any more and the drink list is just a joke.  They only have deals on Coors and PBR.... joke.  Only one booze special, not even a generic well drinks special....lame.   And their rewards program sends out deals every so often... sometimes the server knows about it... and sometimes the place just fails on it all together.  The current special is $1 off Craft Bottled beer.... ummm... yeah, they only have ONE choice.  One....some trendy cider.  yeeeeah. Super deal people. 

I quit going here a couple months ago, and gave it a try again recently hoping the place had made a turn around... barely, but not really.  Maybe I'll be back in a year RR.... perhaps you will have figured out how to get back to quality and smiling burgers by then."}
{"text":"Of all the giant chains that I really enjoy it has to be Red Robin Burgers. They are consistently great and I am very happy with all of the more healthier options and substitutions that are made available at these restaurants. The service is usually good and if you want a beer at this family place you can get one. The decor is sort of tacky to me but I can see past that."}
{"text":"As always the soup, clam chowder, was hot and yummy. Ordered the usual Mushroom on ciabbatta, mom had her shrimp and dad had burning love burger. Unfortunately both burgers and fries were cold however the server did a great job and promptly got the manager. Dad' s came back good however my meal ended up being french  fries and iced tea.  Lucky leftovers at home. Even though the meal was not what we planned the Manager really tried and we could see he cared."}
{"text":"The place was very busy but asked for an outside table and was seated quickly. Great food, friendly server, quick on the drink refills and unlimited fries. We got a bit chilly outside in late October with the misting system running and asked if they would please turn it off and was immediately accommodated. Good job, Red Robin. Yummmmm."}
{"text":"Don't eat at this Red Robin!  The server was horrible and the food was even worse.  The burger I ordered was dry and cold and the salad was warm and wilted."}
{"text":"This was my first time at red Robin an I wish I knew how awesome this place was before, the manager WILLIAM by far the best manager I have ever talked to,sat us down an was so friendly, I refuse to eat onions an let me tell you I had the siracha burger an it had onions that were crunchy an now I'm in love. Our waitress Gloria one of a kind,amazing customer service always checking on us. This place is highly recommended by me. I will be back because not only was the service amazing the food to good"}
{"text":"It's really sad and bad when you save your money and are looking to go out for a great burger and are so disappointed. That's this joint! I ordered the mushroom burger. What I got was a sub-standard burger with CANNED mushrooms. Red Robin can't even give the customer fresh cut sautéed mushrooms. That's pathetic. I got slimy canned mushrooms. It'll be a long time before I go to a Red Robin again for a hamburger. Terrible food, my server was nice but it takes more than a good server for customers to come back."}
{"text":"The lady at the entry named Kylie is horrendous. Attitude while leaning on the podium and looking annoyed makes for a very bad first impression. Now, I've been to Red Robin in the past and never was impressed,,but my son wanted it cause he had a free birthday burger. 
Just a crap dinner all around. The mini pretzels came with beer cheese. I usually like beer cheese but this one was overly beery. Not good. I got the a1 burger. The bun was a joke. Ice cold and hard. 
Server wasn't awful but when your working with crap food what can you do?"}
{"text":"My kids love Red Robin and we end up there for family gatherings often. We used to love coming here but like other reviewers have stated the quality has declined. Fry portions are smaller and nobody wants to continually beg for \"bottomless\" fries. I was excited with what I thought was an improvement in the kids meal only to be dissaponted when my son ordered from the new larger portions menu only to recieve a very tiny portion of pasta. I couldn't imagine what the standard size portion of the pasta would have been. I wish I would have taken a picture. The manager brought us some additional pasta but it wasn't much at all. My 8 year old decided we wouldn't be coming back which is huge considering we used to come once a month at his request."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for years but our last few visits have been horrible.  Our most recent was perhaps the worst experience ever.  The food came out luke warm and the burgers had an odd after taste.  The french fries we received from definitely from the bottom of the barrel - broken tiny pieces that were hard as a rock.  The waitress was obviously overwhelmed and her service showed it, thus we really didn't have a chance to request a hot meal and were stuck with what we received.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for years and obviously the still have me coming back. After the remodel, service and food have gotten noticeably better. If yourr in the galleria mall  i highly recommend stopping in, then walk around the mall a few times to walk off all the unlimited baskets of fries youve eaten."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Red Robin. Whether it be their drinks or their bottomless fries or their awesome burgers... even the sweet potatoes fries are amazing! This location can get busy during prime time dining hours, but that's the best worst problem a business can have - meaning people like the food and the service that much!! I will continue coming to this location for their top notch service and those nice salty, crispy, bottomless fries.. yuuuuuum!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place.  Went to Red Robin a few nights ago with the wife.  Ordered two \"tavern double burgers\" as that was the special they were running.  Is it my imagination, or are the burgers tiny now?  For a double-patty hamburger, both our entrees were more along the size of a White Castle burger, the wife correctly pointed out.  We left the place after an appetizer, two beers and two burgers, and we were still hungry.  It was an oddly upsetting feeling.

And if you've been to a Red Robin lately, you've noticed the little tablet computers mounted at each table, that allow you to see menu items, pay your bill, play a little game and GET A $2 ENTERTAINMENT FEE added to your bill.  Yes, for the privilege of trouncing three anonymous strangers at a trivia game, I was charged an extra $2.  Mind you, there is NO warning about this charge when you play the game.  That is unacceptable.

Red Robin you are still a great place to eat, but you're walking a fine line with the mini burgers and the unannounced fees.  Hopefully you'll see the error of your ways."}
{"text":"Friend had been wanting to try out the burgers here. Nothing special. Hamburger was served with no condiments, such mayo, mustard or ketchup. What's up with these places serving plain burgers? Maybe there are people that eat burgers with nothing on them. To me, the burgers would be dry, even if it's cooked medium, without extra flavoring. The service was just not the greatest. When buzzed the thing on the table for the waitress, she never came. As for bottomless fries, you have to practically hunt them down to get more. We were playing their Trivia game and didn't know it cost anything until we saw it on the bill. Both of us did not see any notification of that. They did remove it off the bill."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite family restaurant, not any more.  They have been going through a lot of changes as the other reviewers have noted, and change here is not for the better.

First off we always have to wait.  I understand waiting if there is a wait, but not when the place is half or more empty.   Every time they offer the same excuse.  A server called in sick.  Actually 4-5 would have to have called in, but I don't believe them regardless.  It's this way all the time.

They serve 'bottomless' fries, which is great for kids.  However, now you have to plan on the first batch and those that actually come with your sandwich being cold.   They'll say they are sorry and bring more in 15 minutes.

They have an elaborate allergy procedure, which is important to us, and the kitchen will mess up the first and maybe second time anyway.  Other than the time it's not so bad when you expect it.  

Refills are hit or miss depending on the server but generally better than most places.  The food itself is still about as good as it always has been, it just takes a lot longer now.

If you complain to the manager (assuming there is a real issue) he will handle it well, say he's sorry, and usually comp the wrong meal.  He'll say they are better than this and ask for another chance.  Unfortunately there's only so many of those to be had."}
{"text":"The food was decent except for my wife's soup which was cold.  She wanted wanted some hot soup on a cool December evening, and it arrived at room temperature.  Everyone else was done eating by the time she got a warm bowl of soup.

But my real problem were these Ziosk terminals at each table.  I have never experienced anything like this at a restaurant before.  As soon as we sat down I grabbed it from my 3yr old and put it at the end of the table facing away from us up against a box of poinsettias.  At no time did we use the Ziosk terminal, but somehow moving it resulted in a $2 \"entertainment fee\".  The staff were quick to remove it from the bill, but it took a while for them to arrive at the table after paging them via the Ziosk.  This practice seems sketchy to me as I can see some people not reading the bill carefully.  Then I was forced to interact with the terminal to pay my bill via credit card.  I was surprised that it defaulted to a 20% tip which was kind of presumptuous, versus letting you specify the tip.  I always just do 20% of the food/beverage total and round up to the nearest whole dollar.   Additionally, the suggested tip was on the post-tax amount versus the food/beverage total.  Why would I tip on money going to the Great State of Ohio?

Then, it wanted my email address to email me a receipt - I presume this is a ploy to fill my inbox with Red Robin spam.  So instead of opted for a printed receipt, but then the printer was jammed.  So twice I had to wait around for someone to help me with the Ziosk - once to remove the ridiculous entertainment fee, and other for a printed bill.

I guess this is why I never go to chain restaurants, but I was desperate after some late night holiday activities and trapped in suburbia."}
{"text":"I went after work and the place was very empty.   It was nice and clean though which was nice.   I was quickly seated and my server was helping others, but made sure she stopped by to introduce herself and let me know she would be back in a couple minutes.   It was actually really cold in the restaurant and I was a little on the uncomfortable side because of it.   
My server was very friendly and was almost too friendly.  She was super nice.  She had my drink refills at my table before I was finished with my first one.   The hamburger was tasty and very warm.  The fries were not crispy or hot and so I had to take off a star for that.   I really liked the personal devices at the table to pay your bill, browse through the menu, and even request refills and appetizers."}
{"text":"Order my granddad kids chocolate milk. It came in a hard plastic glass with a to go lid. The lid came off and she had milk spilled down the front. The waitress stated they got new kids and cups. Guess the person behind the bar did not get the memo on the new cups and glasses and manager has not removed all old glasses. A to go cup works great!"}
{"text":"Talk about burger size! I pride myself on being able to scarf burgers with the best of 'em but this was a time where I couldn't take another bite. I ordered the Burger With No Name. I just knew I finally had to try a burger with as good of a fried egg as there was in the picture I saw. My mother ordered their patty melt.

I was happy to see they didn't drown my plate in French fries like a lot of other places do. Their raspberry limeade was top notch and was almost tempted to order another just do I could take it home.

Their pretzel bites were typical of any other place that serves soft pretzels. 

I plan on coming back to try the one burger with the onion straws. These 3 stars are representative of a hopeful next encounter of another kind."}
{"text":"Had to send burger back COLD! Asked for  coleslaw got french fries. The only thing that came out right was an ice cold Corona."}
{"text":"Negative stars isn't a option so one will suffice !! First off your sign says gourmet burgers and beers ! That is a lie , they had no beer on tap besides coors light and bud light , no IPA's no stouts etc.. Beer menu is sad , beer glass came out and was dirty , hamburger came out and was cold , will never go back here , should've just went to BJ's to begin with !"}
{"text":"I've been to many a Red Robin in my day, and this one was absolutely, positively the worst. 

After a nearly 6 hour haul from Indy for work, we just needed something filling and fairly fast, so we thought Red Robin would be the way to go...no.

We ordered the beer shakes which were awesome! (The only reason for the second star) the blue moon shake is to die for! However, it took nearly 15 minutes to get our shakes and an additional 20 to get a glass of water! Yikes!

When we finally had a chance to order our food, mind you after all of the tables around us already had their appetizers, we had an hour wait! And we only got it after an hour because we told them we would just like our check and then to leave...totally unacceptable. Aside from that, our server was incredibly rude the entire visit, and the manager was less than concerned about our horrible experience. 

Just because of their service, I will not be stopping here while traveling again."}
{"text":"The food here is always good. Great burgers and I'm pretty partial to the cod fish and chips, with those bottomless steak fries. Every time we come here, the staff is amazing, attentive and with personality plus! We got turned on to Dr Pepper floats and Sprite floats here as well. Ask for Mike, he'll do right by you."}
{"text":"Me and my family went this past Saturday and the food was great. I had a sangria and it was pretty sting (so good). The only reason it's not 5 stars was the services. The waitress wasn't that attentive and the hostess didn't greet us for a while"}
{"text":"Good food. I know it is a chain, but you know what you get here every time!"}
{"text":"It's a chain, but it's one of those chains that has a good loyalty rewards program so we come here probably a handful of times a year.

You get a free burger with the purchase of 10 burgers (doesn't have to be simultaneous) and a free burger on your birthday.

A single burger here will run you over 1,000 calories. That's because they sear the bun in margarine and most burgers will come with mayo. I usually get the Bonzai burger without margarine, mayo and cheese and the damage is usually limited to around 670 calories.

The burgers are fire grilled and I suppose you can taste some kind of char, but the patties are otherwise unremarkable. 

They are known for their bottomless steak fries, but also certain bottomless substitutions, such as a side salad, coleslaw and broccoli. They offer sweet potato fries now too, which are also bottomless at an upcharge."}
{"text":"Carl's does it better; they just need to serve beer!

While we were eating our appetizer (straight from freezer to Chef Mike), the display on our table had a trivia question. We answered it, which led to more questions. When our food arrived, we quit playing.

We ordered chicken sandwiches. While the bun was good, and the topping was tasty, the chicken was sliced thin enough it could be transparent. Hardly any meat at all. The fries are large, but not especially well done.

Our server was pleasant, and I informed her it had been years since I'd been to a Red Robin. That should had been a clue for her. She ended up being inattentive. She did offer a refill, but it took so long I had finished my meal. She never offered more \"endless fries\".

She told us to use the electronic module on our table to pay the bill. 
The bill included a $1.99 \"entertainment fee\". This was for the trivia questions we answered. At no time did we notice that there was a charge to play trivia. It would be easy for a family to have their kids play trivia without knowing they are being charged for it. This is something that the Arizona Attorney General should investigate.

Our server did say that the fee was in very small print, but we double checked and some screens do list a fee at all. She did have the fee removed, but it took several attempts.

Red Robin had sent me an email that the second entree would be 50% off. In the email it appears like a special. We learned that you have to enter your phone number in order to receive the discount.

To me, Red Robin is practicing deceptive marketing that is at least immoral and most likely illegal."}
{"text":"Normally, I'm a huge fan of Red Robin.  I've had nothing but positive experiences at other Valley locations we have been to.  However, we had a very negative experience at the Arrowhead location.  Our service was TERRIBLE, and that's being nice about it.  I think we saw our server a grand total of twice from the moment we were seated to when we checked out, and we had to flag down other servers to get drink refills, the check, etc.  The food was good- the only saving grace of the entire experience- but with service like that, we will definitely be avoiding this location in the future!"}
{"text":"Red Robin, as a whole, is one of my favorite chains.  The food is always good and the service is usually top notch.  I've been to this particular location a few times and been completely satisfied.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and it was pretty dead. Food took a long time and the plate was hotter then the food. I think it sat a little too long. They need to get faster servers for the lunch time crowd"}
{"text":"Decent food. But i totally got sick a few weeks ago"}
{"text":"Went here last night, taking my son and mother out for dinner and heard this place was supposed to be pretty good. I feel lied to about that one.
First, dirty dishes brought out with the food. Dirty as in caked food very present on them.
Second, lack luster appetizers. No really flavor at all.
Third, the burgers...
I got the mushroom burger, and it was as if they dumped a lukewarm can of sliced mushrooms on top of a soggy, cold burger. 
My mother was less than impressed with her patty melt, feeling it was no better than Sonic.
Move on to the bathroom.
Disgusting. Littered with feminine products.
Will NEVER go to another Red Robin after this experience, even if it were free."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with the food, the hamburger was small and not so hot.  Cooked well but not flavorful, the fries were cold and soggy,  The only redeeming quality about the meal was the service was friendly and attentive, A little expensive for a hamburger,"}
{"text":"Wow! Used to get a nice hand packed and big burger, but have switched to a skinny frozen beef patty that looks and tastes like it was cooked at Burger King. Perfect charcoal broil lines. Is this a 15.00 minimum wage change because the burger sucked and I won't pay 13 bucks again for this. Even with endless fries. Service was excellent I have to say."}
{"text":"Food was small in portion and really skimpy on sauces. Ask for fries and it took forever then the portion was super small. 
 Service was ok, not great by any means. Refills? What's that. Lol. Had to ask like three times to get one."}
{"text":"This place is in need of some huge management change. My husband and I sat outside on the patio for a couple burgers last night and were appalled at what we saw. There were 4 tables that left shortly after we got there and when we finished our  dinner 40 min later no one had cleared the tables. My husband had to stare at half eaten burgers during our entire dinner. It was so bad that a group of young boys came to get some food and cleared their own table. Are you kidding me?!!!!! It was so ridiculous. Not to mention our fries were cold. How do you mess up a burger and fries. We asked to talk with the manager and she just told us they have been very busy. No real apologies or anything. The only reason i give this a 1 is because our server was half way decent. She did not have the tables that weren't cleared. She did take our plates thank goodness. We have been coming here for years but will never return!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this Red Robin, having been to a number of different ones in other areas. Our server seemed rushed and three of our 5 orders were wrong - my son ordered grilled cheese and carrots and received mac and cheese and oranges, I ordered no pink and my burger was pink, our appetizer was wrong also.  We had to ask for the fun, coloring menus for both kids (even though we requested kids menus for them). They brought my toddler's drink in a regular class and not a child's cup. The manager did manage to get all of us the right orders (except my burger as I didn't want to wait for an additional burger).  The kids meals were brought with the appetizers rather than with our meals. The fries were simply thrown on the plate with no presentation and were slightly under cooked. Needless to say, we'll find another Red Robin in our area to go back to next time.  The manager at this one wasn't very apologetic and it wasn't busy in the least."}
{"text":"If you like a good burger, I would recommend getting chicken here :)
For a place that specializes in burgers it is a little pathetic how they cannot cook a burger to order if their life depended on it. I have been here several times and after the first couple of burgers I ordered with \"some pink\" came out more than well done, I stopped ordering beef here. No complaints about the chicken and the fries are pretty good. If you're looking for something quick and okay to eat, this is your place. But, don't be too surprised when the food is not \"stellar\" or even really anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Great fries & seasoning! I loved the blueberry shakes but they have discontinued it :( Other shakes are good too, but my favorite is out! My son & husband like the Burgers. Appetizers are not so good. All in all, nice family restaurant."}
{"text":"I was going to Red Robin today to enjoy a great burger.  On the way there I was almost sideswiped on the freeway.  As a 100% disabled marine, I started having a full on panic attack. By the time I walked in, the host recognized & helped me greatly.  I ordered my burger to go & had to get myself straight again. 
Thanks again for helping this vet in a bad time."}
{"text":"Our waitress Megan was amazing, she was so nice, attentive, and was always on top of making sure my mother and I were doing good. The food came out fast and was fresh, hot, and simply delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered to go tonight. The person on the phone told us our order would be ready in 10-15 minutes. After running an errand and then getting there at least 20 minutes after calling in our order then it was not ready. Waiting another 20 minutes. Total wait time was 45 minutes, finally getting our food around 5:00 on a Sunday afternoon. 
I've worked in the industry for years and would have understood if the restaurant was slightly busy or around 7 during dinner. I even understand tickets get lost during a paper change or not put in right away but at least try to make the situation right. Nothing was said, no apology what so ever. 
Your online prices are cheaper just an FYI! 
The reason for 3 stars is because my burger was great! Soggy bun but thats expected with togo burgers,  your fries are always amazing, this time not so much and we actually ordered extra this time....yay.  They had NO seasoning on them what so ever and were soggy, they are usually so tasty. Your guacamole is great and the mac n cheese was wonderful. 
Im more just sad, spending more than $30 for an ok meal. I usually enjoy eating here, this isn't the 1st time we had problems with a to go order here. Please work on these things."}
{"text":"Came here with my baby s Daddy Avery Wilmont.He ordered a double bacon cheeseburger which was delicious. I ordered the fish plate which was cooked in old burnt oil and was very dark and funky.I also had the clam chowder it was thick and slimy.The only reason I'm leaving 3 stars is the Manager came out and made it right."}
{"text":"I am usually a fan of Red Robin, they have good burgers for a casual restaurant and gluten free options, which I appreciate.

Today, it was packed around 1 but we were able to get seated quickly. We felt our waitress rushed us a little, in coming back twice to ask if we were ready less than 10 minutes after being seated. Normally, I wouldn't care as I always order the same thing, but my two friends actually needed time to look at the menu.

Our food was fresh, delicious and arrived quickly. 

My only complaints on this visit were that my order did not come with a gluten free bun, which I suggested and our waitress had a hard time splitting our check after their kiosk couldn't split it three ways. 

I will always keep RR as an back pocket option because its affordable and has decent burgers."}
{"text":"I usually have a good experience with this particular location of Red Robin, but today was a bit of a let down. My husband's burger came out cold. He ate it, and we came home where he proceeded to vomit up the burger. I know it wasn't anything he ate earlier because we ate the same thing for breakfast, and I didn't become ill after eating my burger."}
{"text":"I visited this Red Robin location 9/24/16 with a friend and we had the BEST service!! Our server was Sharonda who was very on top of things. We came in right on the lunch rush (I used to be a server) but Sharondo took care of us and the food came out quickly. I even asked to speak to the manager before we left to give her praise. The same day I went to Pita Jungle for dinner and had the worse service. I wish more servers were like Sharonda. Thank you Sharonda and Red Robin for a great experience."}
{"text":"Generally I absolutely love red robin, but this happy valley location seems to be lacking. The staffs behavior with each other tends to portray a negative vibe, perhaps because they always seem understaffed. The patio never has a server so half the time they will not seat people out there, even on a busy Sunday evening. The tables outside were also extremely dirty the one time we did try to sit out there. Still love their food, but this location could use some help along the lines of management."}
{"text":"Where should i begin? Not even deserving of one star. Long wait for terrible service, employees don't know what their doing. Took over 20 mins to get our beverages my salad came out faster than our drinks. We were also told our section was being waited on but the server would take our table. Why would a server not be assigned to our section but the host decided to seat us here?! Makes no sense exactly why I styrd employees don't knw what's going on. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"When it's a busy time (Fri or Sat night), be prepared for service to be a tad slower. Usually servers do well keeping up. Always get fast soda refills without asking. We ask for fries and dipping sauces before our burgers; they usually say they don't know if they can get them out. They sometimes do but always forget the sauces. OFTEN my burger doesn't come out hot. But they have remade it the two times this has happened. We love the chain and the food. And the unlimited fries makes this one of our favorite date night spots! The manager Daniel is great too and always has a smile on his face!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! Walked in and the hostess said hello and I sat at the bar. The bartender walked by me behind the bar back and forth 5-6 times and never acknowledged me one time. I sat there for 5 minutes and afterwards I got up and left the hostess at that time said thank you and have a good day. I can't believe nobody even talk to me the manager also walked up behind the hostess stand saw me  and never said a word."}
{"text":"I normally love Red Robin, but my experience here the other day wasn't as good as it could have been.

We got there around 4:30 or so, and there was apparently a 25 minute wait for a table. Even though there were empty tables in the restaurant. Maybe it's because there were 5 of us plus a highchair? I don't know. My father-in-law notices that there is a table on the patio and asks if we can have that one instead. The host stand said yes, it's first come first serve on the patio, but got very snippy that we didn't want to wait.

So we go outside and have to find someone to clean off the tables (we needed two since they were only 4-tops), and the person who did looked extremely annoyed to be bothered by doing so. He cleaned off the tables, didn't put them together for us and rearrange the chairs, and gave us a highchair with crusted on food and liquid spilled all over it. So we had to clean the highchair off, put the tables together and arrange all the chairs. I also had to go track down silverware and napkins because there weren't any placed on the table.

Our waiter was the bright spot - he was prompt, very nice and took our orders quickly. He brought us our menus (and a kids menu right away when asked) and made sure we had waters and our appetizer as soon as possible. My sister-in-law (she's 12) ordered a milkshake and he brought her a large one instead of the kid size. 

My food was good - we had the onion ring appetizer (YUM), I actually just got the pick 2 appetizer for my meal. Cheese sticks and zucchini sticks, both were good. My drink was lacking in the flavor arena - I got the Sand in Your Shorts. It tasted mainly like sweet and sour. Nothing like what I was expecting.

So three stars instead of two due to our waiter. Wish I could remember his name!"}
{"text":"I always get the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap when I go here - this is the only Red Robin I've found that actually makes it right! Other ones for some reason just don't taste good.

Plus the fries. You can't beat the fries! Ask for extra ranch - they taste even better that way."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a craving for Red Robin but we were also very skeptical due to our previoua visit about a year ago. Our server, who was a taller, bigger guy with glasses in the bar was very rude and even laughed when we asked for bottomless fries before the food came out. He even shook his head when we sat down and could hear him talking smack about us to another employee. Worst service we have had anywhere at any point in time while dining out. HOWEVER!!! this last time we decided to give this location another shot and went in around 7 pm on wednesday march 18th. We were greeted by the very nice girls at the front and were sat in the bar promptly, again. Needless to say we were very skeptical because it was the same exact booth we sat in at our previous experience. This place was packed and everything was shaping up to be yet again another bust. Well when the bartender, Mike, came up to us and greeted us we knew things would be different. Mike was so awesome right from the get go. He took the time to ask if we've ever been in before, eventhough it was really busy, and proceeded to go through happy hour specials and made some really sweet recommendations on drinks, appetizers, and entrees. He was very fast and extremely attentive. We could see how busy he was making all of those shakes! It did not even come close to altering the level of service provided to us. Mike made us feel like we were regulars and that we weren't customers but rather friends at his home. It was amazing to see him be so polite and respectful to all of the guests around us. He talked me into getting the smokin burger and boy was he right when he said it was like a bacon cheeseburger on steroids. BEST BURGER EVER!!! We will definitely be back and will most definitely ask for Mike again, although he told us that he had confidence that if we sat with anyone we would have the same service. Mike, we hope you get to read this and we hope to see you again. You made this dining experience the best we have ever had. This Red Robin is absolutely wonderful and would recommend it to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Food awesome but waitress filled drinks and never took one plate off table even after dropping check and empty hands she was so busy at the hostess stand..not sue of her name white  girl with tats we had five in our party.come on show some class."}
{"text":"wow.. just nasty!
Appetizers came after the main course. 
Vodka Tonic in a short glass was huge and was at least 16 oz. of tonic.
 BUT the best thing was the nasty burger. They gave me 2 half's. Yes, I got 1/2 of a rare burger and 1/2 of a well done burger, covered in cheese.  I guess they though I wouldn't notice.
 This is the first time ever that I left a 10% tip... with a long note on their copy of the bill."}
{"text":"Bad experience. Had lunch with my boss and 2 customers, got our food and my boss pulled a plastic gloves out of her burger. Got no free meal or discount. Never going to any Red Robin again"}
{"text":"I'm truly surprised I'm even giving these people two stars... 

Upon being seated our waitress came and asked for our drink order. She promptly brought back our kids' drinks and forgot our waters and drinks. It took ten minutes to get two waters and a beer. Five minutes after that she took our order. 

FOURTY-FIVE minutes later we got our food. We have already been here for an hour. Why on earth could it possibly take this long for 4 burgers and fries? None of our drinks were refilled. Ever. The manager brought us our food and my husband asked him to bring a new drink and refill our sons drink, I also asked him for the two sides of honey mustard we were missing. He proceeded to tell me we were asking for to much. Sorry sir, but if my waitress ever came by I'd ask her instead. Waited Almost ten minutes for honey mustard, which was brought by two members of the kitchen staff... Not sure what that was all about. 
My burger was sooooo greasy that within two minutes the bun was a soggy disaster. The burger was falling apart faster than I could eat it, and the bun had turned completely to mush. 
Fries and especially their honey mustard, great as always. So I guess the two stars are for the honey mustard if I'm being honest.
We sat there as our two year olds who had finally had enough started getting antsy and knocking everything to the floor. It was probably 15 minutes before we were actually done eating before we saw our server again, in which she dropped off the check and walked off. Had to hunt her down to actually get her to run the card so we could leave. Awful awful customer service. And they either need to get more hardcore buns or cut WAY back on the grease so avoid the soggy disaster that is served to you. 
My advice red robin? Fire everyone at this location and start over. Your staff is destroying this restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh boy I love eating here. I go with anyone who will go with me! I even go alone!  The Burgers are so good! Whether I want mushrooms, guacamole or   Anything...YUM! The salads I have tried, delicious, the root beer float, ahhh! This Red Robin has the best servers! So fun!"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday-  New Years Day...  they were busy but not that busy-  It took 20 minutes for the food to come out the first time-  cold...then 15 more minutes the 2nd time...but they got my meal wrong...they re-made it the 3rd time and it was still wrong....  made it 4 times...it's been an hour and 10 minutes...I ate it;....but it was still wrong...  you'd think I ordered something special....  hamburger without maynoise protein style cooked medium...they couldn't get it right...every time came out beyond well done...  not sure how many time the manager said I'm sorry and finally the 4th time said...maybe we need to check the grill...you think????  I bet most people would deal with it and just not go back....  If I'm paying for something I want it right and the way I want it....   I get mistakes happen...but 4 times...  they need to get their $#&%*)&%@  together or they'll find everyone going to the other Red Robins where you get what you order."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the MASSIVE AMOUNTS of fruit flies covering the walls and flying around my face. I sat in the bar area on my lunch break, the server/bartender was awesome, the food was great, but the cleanliness obviously has a problem. I don't even want to know what kind of gunk was behind the bar or in the kitchen to create this infestation. I watch bar rescue religiously and I joked to my boyfriend about how it needed a 'bar or franchise rescue' because of all the bugs. It makes me question my food and how sanitary it really was. I literally counted them all on the wall behind my boyfriends head in a two foot radius there was at least 25 fruit flies. On top of constantly having to bat them away while trying to enjoy my lunch break. Soooo grosssss!"}
{"text":"My fourth time to this location and have been to Red Robin numerous times. Service is horrible has been each time - meaning slow and unfriendly. Wait times just for water are ridiculous. I went in Friday at 12 and didn't get burger until 1! Many others waiting as well. I think I am done!"}
{"text":"The burgers were average, huge and relatively satisfying. I'm not a major fan of steak fries but they were good too. Service was mediocre. I'm not sure why but we always had to ask to have the fries refilled. I thought it was bottomless, it's kind of uncomfortable to continually have to ask your server three or four times to get your money's worth.

Sidenote, but it was through the greasy deliciousness of Red Robin that my girlfriend finally found out she had a stomach ulcer. The night after we ate it she ended up in the ER with intense stomach pain. Bottomless steak fries aren't messing around, people! I'm not sure we'll be back anytime soon, given her affliction!!"}
{"text":"Its red robin, mediocre food for a high price. I have friends that occasionally drag me here because \"Unlimited fries!\".

There are many much better places to get a burger for cheap, and close to this location."}
{"text":"Server was very on his game(lil loud tone of voice) kinda funny in a good way, always remember their ice tea is not flavored so of you prefer a raspberry ice tea the raspberry is a syrup they pour into your ice tea some servers can over pour on your syrup but I don't make a big deal out of it, I got my drink! Me & my fam frenz started off with the shorty o-rings & the wings n'yukon chips which were island style-maui amazing. I had the bacon cheeseburger which was good. Too much mayo & I had not much fries. Knowing that the fries are bottomless I figured they would start off with a good portion of fries. My time there was good. Service very friendly & quick."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. No refills on drinks, fries. Rude waiter. His name started with a J.  He came to the table immediately, we barely sat down before he asked us what we wanted. Then after the food was served he never came back to the table. The last time we were there it seemed like it wasn't as good as it used to be either. Burgers are ok but there are so many other burger options out there now that I won't be going back."}
{"text":"For a first timer, I thought the food was good! Got the banzai burger with their yummy fries.  A little heavy on the mayo for me though.  The artichoke spinach dip was really good.  Especially with the garlic bread it came with.  A lot of what was in the menu looked really good.  I wanted to try the new mint chocolate brownie shake but I had no room in my tummy for that! =) So, i'll definitely go back for it.  I give this place 2-thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I hope the food we ordered is better than the 'ambiance.' They are remodeling g. The smell of paint is very strong. We were led to a table with a dirty napkin balled up under it. The friendly server spoke fast and so high pitched it was hard to understand what was being said."}
{"text":"I'm upping my review by a star because of their birthday procedure.  I was shocked when my son turned 2 and I called 6 family-friendly restaurants trying to find one where they would sing him happy birthday and 4 of them said \"no.\"  Red Robin not only sang to him, but they also gave him a big hot fudge sundae, and he was over the moon!  Thanks for the birthday cheer!"}
{"text":"Disappointed not once but everytime at this location. Today the fries and crispy chicken tasted like old rancid oil. The waitress was extremely inattentive, to not only our table but to the other patrons in her area. We had to flag her down for basic needs i.e  napkins and water, so forget her asking if we were ok. Another patron had to get up and go look for her. If you want a good burger...stay home and make it yourself."}
{"text":"Was my first time there and I gotta admit food was great!! Server was very friendly and he met all our needs. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Dinner was awesome and our server Rita was phenomenal. My mother just got to town from San Diego and we went to get a quick bite. She was kind, fast and effective!"}
{"text":"Hamburgers was delicious but the service was slow, it is impossible for only one waitress to serve all tables in the bar by herself with no help, she was very nice but she can't"}
{"text":"Always had a good experience there, last one was no d different. 
Atmosphere in the restaurant is always jolly and fun. 
They have always been able to accommodate my request for a booth seat. 
Like the selection on their menu. They always have some new items so keeps it interesting.
I should put a disclaimer that I don't eat beef - but they will make any burger on the menu with the gardenburger patty.  So really the entire menu is open to me.
Food quality is good and fresh.  Taste and flavors are also always interesting.
I like the fact that they made the fries portions small - so that they don't sit there getting cold while u eat. You can always get more as they are \"bottomless fries\".
Most servers that I have had have been good.
Overall, very good for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I use to think very highly of this place until today when the server brought my water and there was left over food floating around in it. also my burger was wayyyy too salty!"}
{"text":"Got me the tavern double burger, it was delicious. And the customer service was great."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with Red Robin anymore.  I haven't been here for a while so we decided to check it out.  My mother in law, my 5 year old, and myself for the basics: kids burger meal, bacon cheeseburger, peppercorn burger, a water, and a lemonade. Walked out $40 later and wasn't impressed.  They have the little robot/self-service kiosk at the table, makes paying super easy, but a very impersonal experience.  We saw our server once (to take our order) then never again, then that robot has the audacity to try and auto-tip 20%! No. Knock that down a bit and we headed for the door.  Not to mention NO ONE said goodbye or have a good night.  Won't be going back here."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went here on Super Bowl Sunday.  The place was empty!  We waited at the host stand a good ten minutes before the customer behind us got frustrated and went to get somebody who was more busy reprimanding people than helping us get seats as she looked our way.  The woman came over and sat us at a table.  We waited another ten minutes and never got acknowledged by anyone.  We were hoping to at least place a drink order but no one ever came.  

We finally decided the wait was too long since we were starving and headed to the mall food court and had the best gyros from kyklos greek cafe.  This is the second time this has happened to us at this location.  I wrote the company about our situation and have yet to hear a response. Not that I care since I wont go back there.  The burgers are great here but I dont see fit in this economy to drop $10.00 for a burger plus drink and receive bad service when IN-N-OUT is right across the parking lot!

DONT GO HERE IF YOU WANT GOOD SERVICE! SERIOUSLY!"}
{"text":"Literally the best customer service I've ever had at any location. Even when there was a mishap with how a new guy charged us a while back, we couldn't even be mad! Their manager was so helpful and kind."}
{"text":"Finally making my way back to red Robin after a terrible experience with service and food last time, I hoped for the best. I got food to go so I wouldn't have to deal with that this time, but was still disappointed. Ordered two burger medium after finding being told med well has no pink, and still received two burgers that were well done. I also ending up paying tax on my to go order, and after bringing it to their attention they said sorry, but never took the tax off. I am not the type to make a huge deal out of it, but it's expected that I pay for my food, and they make it right and charge me correctly. I also got nachos which was not a great idea, but it seemed like they were even soggier than I expected, and there was virtually no meat. Overall this seals the deal, after the last bad experience, and mediocre before that, I'll never be back."}
{"text":"If you're in the Centennial area in NW Las Vegas, you're probably familiar with this popular burger chain. The prices aren't too bad for the food, but purpose for this review is to give our server Johnny, I believe, a shout out for being so awesome! The 5 stars go to him, honestly & it's rare that I enjoy service!

Walking in, we were seated in a less crowded area at a roomy table and was immediately met with our server. My mom had a bday coupon & another one, & had asked the server about them. He kindly said he would grant the bday coupon, but was unsure about the other & will ask the manager as well as our drink orders.

Our food came out quickly & was hot and fresh. Here's the breakdown (only including ratings for the first two because that's what my daughter & I ordered):

Sautéed 'Shroom (4/5): Requested a little pink, I like a juicy burger! It was pretty good, I just wish it was seasoned a little more. You know a burger is da bomb when you don't have to add much to make it taste good. 

Kid's Menu Swirly Twirly Pasta (5/5): Easy, simple & fun for the kids. Macaroni in a marinara sauce & sprinkled w/ cheese, choice of side & a drink!

Kid's Menu Bottomless Mac n Cheese

Whiskey River BBQ Burger

Burnin Love Burger

Simple Grilled Chicken Burger

Banzai Burger (To Go)

Bottomless Fries & Bottomless Side Salads

Our server checked on us frequently, always replenished our fries/salads/drinks & was very polite & friendly. Please ask to sit in his section if you want prompt & efficient service!"}
{"text":"We have been to this place a few times now.  So it is safe to say I really like it!
Endless fries for starters, then really good Burgers.
 So worth the trip.
They even send you emails about all the great deals that they have going on.
The thing I really like about that is you do not have to print coupons they have it all downloaded on your rewards card.
So I think they really care more about the environment with that because, no ink and no paper wasted. A really good Idea!
Staff is always friendly and nice,even when you call on the phone.
The place is clean and the food is good.
They even made me nice fresh coffee the other day.
My most fun part here is the TV in the floor, I am really amused by that.
Clean bathrooms and lots of parking."}
{"text":"Really disappointing service.  This restaurant was in my regular list but not anymore.  I sat at the bar for 10 minutes at lunch and didn't have a single employee acknowledge my presence.  I wasn't greeted at the door either.  This is lunch hour.  No wonder the parking lot is empty! !!"}
{"text":"Off night? We waited to be seated for table of 2 for about 20 minutes but when we were shown to our table there were plenty of open seats 1/2 of the place was empty. Maybe a staffing issue. Our waiter brought us water and my friends glass had a large glob of what appeared to be strawberry milkshake residue stuck on the inside of her glass. The waiter brought a new cup and we told him we were ready to order he said ok he will be right back.... Waited 10 minutes for him to appear. We ordered our food and he brought it but we had no utensils he said he would go grab those and some more fries. Someone else we flagged down helped us about 15 minutes later because dude never came back. The next time we saw him he was having a heated exchange with another employee before walking past our table. We got our bill and he apologized saying he started out behind. We paid and never came back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on my fiancés birthday and it was awful. Our glasses were so dirty that we asked for our drinks in a to-go cup. My fiancés meal was overcooked and inedible. The manager came over and asked if there was anything more he could do, after we had had the worst experience possible - what a joke."}
{"text":"Love the D.G.B. Burger. The only thing I didn't like is that I ordered my burger to be well-done cooked and I got it overcooked."}
{"text":"I swear I've tried to give Red Robin several chances, but this chain always makes me sick to my stomach (literally). I'm pretty sure it's because they cook veggie burgers on the same grill as the hamburgers.  In turn, making my meat intolerant body go crazy.

Another location at Northlake Mall left my burger in the bathroom instead of my stomach. This location, I just feel queasy and gross. 

Why did I continue to eat here you ask? I'm a nanny and my family loves this place! It's super kid friendly and they have the bland, generic menu that most American kids love. The kids also get excited about the possibility of seeing Red Robin in person (costume) and free balloons. Red Robin is uber kid friendly, I give them that.

But as long as I'm not forced to return through my job, I will never  visit a Red Robin again."}
{"text":"I have to admit first and foremost- I am the worst cook that I know. But at least I didn't do that.
I ordered an appetizer of artichoke and spinach dip that was cold. Ick.
I also ordered a sombrero chicken salad. 
The saltiest meat ever. I mentioned I can't cook, but I do know flavor and paring flavor a. All I tasted was salty. Super Gross, I 
I ordered two margarita on the rocks that were good. Thanks bartender for saving the meal. 
I tried #redrobinburgers again to see if they had improved alas, what a let down."}
{"text":"I love taking my family to Red Robin. I have a waitress (Nicole) been taking care of my family. She is awesome!!! Thank you Nicole. I rate Red Robin just because of Nicole. I just feel the hostess needs to practice more customer service (Greeting and put a smile). I ask the hostess I want Nicole, they told me it will take a little more time to wait, I said that's fine. The hostess told me that they are ready for me to be  seated. I walk with my family to be seated for service. The hostess told me that Nicole won't be my waitress instead she told me that her husband will serve me. I felt upset and I told the hostess\"no\"! You get me Nicole! She look at me with a mad face. Rude lady!!! The cooks did a good job with our food. Thank you. Recap train your hostess. I believe husband and a wife shouldn't be working together. My experience should prove it. It's not fair for another co workers. Nicole your great service is awesome. 

Thank you,
Jayson Wells"}
{"text":"Mushroom burger with Swiss cheese on an onion bun cooked medium rare.... will kill you with love!! 
Off the chart moist. Fries are not my favorite. Wide cut, but free refills, can't complain."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my husband and daughter for an early dinner. We got three entrees and one drink and our bill was $51. Very expensive. My daughter ordered the chicken teriyaki sandwich and was started feeling sick on the way home. She was sick all night. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Our server Oscar was incredibly savvy and on top of everything. He was awesome. The food was tasty, though I ordered way too much and nearly drowned myself in that delicious Freckled Lemonade. It was extremely busy tonight, but we were seated within a few minutes and our server never left us wanting. 5 stars for Oscar."}
{"text":"Good... definitely worth it for the burgers but if you're going to come to the centennial hills location definitely try to get SHANNON as a server - he's amazing.  Management material for sure..."}
{"text":"I am impressed with the team and quality of customer service here.  I am a server at a different restaurant, and I envy the team that they have at Red Robin.  Everyone helps each other, there is no server-to-server competition.  Wow!  My friend and I ate here at night a couple weeks ago, and we were just laughing and having a good time.  We didn't feel rushed at all while we were there.  If it's one thing I don't appreciate at a restaurant, it's when I feel rushed by the server; I may as well have ate at home.  Not here, though.  They are very patient, kind, and provide excellent customer service.  Management, I hope that you realize how great and rare of a team that you have there.  Servers, keep up the wonderful work!  I hope you know how valuable and appreciated you are by your customers!  :)"}
{"text":"We just left Red Robin not only having had a great meal but having the greatest server EVER...thank you Dyllan for such great service!  Friday nights in your section"}
{"text":"Sadly I wasted my money on a chicken barbecue salad that was basically a head of lettuce and a few pieces of chicken and a squirt of barbecue sauce on it.  Sad that they have to try to make money I know how much lettuce costs and it does not cause what they charged me for the salad I will stick with better places for salads in the future and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"YUMMM yyyyy!!!! My family and I have been to Red Robin quite a few times but today they out did themselves!!!! Burgers and fries were excellent. Our waitress was awesome. Thank you Nikki."}
{"text":"I like it here. Service was on timely manner.

Our server was nice and accomodating. 

Food is alot but not the best burgers I had."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. Seriously, I don't know why I went here or why this place is so popular! My grandmother had the seafood entree and it was pathetic, the shrimp looked like little chunks of deep fried bread. I made the mistake of getting the boca burger because i thought a burger establishment as well known as Red Robin could make it could - totally opposite. They have no idea how to make it taste good. It was actually gross! It looked like a sponge and tasted like a sponge. I have been to tons of restaurants who serve meat and also make amazing veggie burgers: Pita Jungle, Islands, The Counter. If you want your restaurant to be a success and make your customers happy then make every single menu item good quality and tasty - otherwise your wasting people's time and money because they could of gone somewhere else. They should take those things off the menu until they can figure it out."}
{"text":"My first time eating here was today, and unfortunately I was not impressed. The first bad impression I got was our waitress because her shirt was filthy, wrinkled and too small. I really don't like looking at stains, while I'm ordering. Next, the waitress brought my drink out in a glass that had a huge crack down the side. I am glad that it didn't break and didn't cut anyone. We started off with the spinach artichoke dip. The tortilla chips tasted stale and there was only a tiny portion of dip for 3 of us to eat. My husband kept smelling his burger and had me smell it. It smelled like fish- gross! Needless to say he didn't eat it. My patty melt was just okay, and my son said the condiments on his burger were sour. There were supposed to be bottomless fries, but we had to wait until we finished most of our meal, until our waitress brought out seconds, so no one really touched them. I also felt the food was over-priced for what we got. I hate being negative, but I was really disappointed. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Over the years I have been coming to RR here in AZ, love the food and some of the service from some waitress. Got to keep on eye on the girls up in front kinda make you think twice. BUt never the less no complaint on the food very simple and good . Tried most of the dishes and love the Strawberry Lemonade. I love the atmosphere for the kids and a dinner with your friends. Don't take my word for it check it out..."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good for a more affordable price. The burgers are good and my waiter was very nice and helpful. 
My issue with this restaurant was the noise level. There was a younger waitress who spoke very loudly. She was having a conversation with other staff across the restaurant, but it was late at night so I figured it's probably the end of her shift and she's tired. Until: she began arguing(?) with an older waitress in the back of the dining room. I'm not sure if it was arguing or just a very fast paced conversation, but it was so loud that I could hardly hear the person I was dining with. Had the waitress been less disruptive I definitely would've given 4 stars, but the most important part of dining is being able to talk with your table and I couldn't do that."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I always sub the Boca patty on the burgers.  Occasionally it is a little over cooked, but they usually do a nice job and it's delicious!  Definitely get the campfire dipping sauce for your fries!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Red Robin for years.  WE LOVE their food and the ambiance of the restaurant.   However, over the last year we have been experiencing impersonal rude staff and slacking service all around.  For example, at the Red Robin on Elliot and Kyrene the last few times we have eaten there our waiter/waitress was nom existent, refills on drinks were nearly impossible let alone getting napkins or condiments.  Also in April I went there for my sons 9th birthday because my kids love the happy birthday song they sing and the free ice cream.  WELL on this day we were told that they were too busy to sing and the ice cream was just dropped off at the table.  I get it I understand things happen but he was super disappointed.  Taking this as a teaching moment I explained to my son that being a server is hard and maybe they were short staffed.  We decided to try a different location for our next Red Robin ventures and the next time we went to the Tempe Market place restaurant.  Here we had a similar problem and when my food was served there was a big black hair in it.  I really do hate being that person that complains about their food, as I have worked in the service industry as well.  I showed the waitress and apologized for being a pain and she told me she would bring me a new meal.  Well my children had already been served and began to eat.  By the time my replacement meal came, which mind you was an avo-cobb-o salad..... My children had finished eating.  If you have children, you know that once the kids have finished eating good luck trying to scarf your meal before the complaints start.  But here comes the worst part...well for me anyways, as I started scarfing my salad I noticed that there was no bacon.  Not only did they take FOREVER to replace my hairy meal they had left off the BACON!!! At this point the manager came over to ask if everything was alright, I explained to him the situation and he apologized but when I received my check nothing had been adjusted.  Like I said I used to be a server and I didn't want to cause a scene so I just paid my bill left 20% and went on my way deciding that this was not the Red Robin for me either.  Finally, we get to the Main Event of this story, Friday July 29, 2016 we took my older son out for his birthday because his absolute favorite place to go is RED ROBIN.  My son has autism and was turning 11.  So we picked a new Red Robin Location to try again.  This time we went to the Red Robin on Stapley and the 60.  Once we were seated the waitress took our order and walked away.  I went after her to tell her that it was my son's birthday and that we would like him to get the birthday treatment.  I could tell she was irritated that I had interrupted her from doing what she was doing so I apologized and thanked her for her time. Well I may be the one in my family who avoids conflict but my mother does not allow people to walk on her and especially not her grandkids.  When I sat back down I told her what had happened and she was a little upset.  So we went on with our lunch.  When our meal was served my burger was missing an add on I had requested but we didn't say anything.  The waitress realized and said that she forgot to tell the chef and that she would bring my add on of avocado on a plate.  Letting that go we had continued on with our meal.  Once finished with our meal the waitress came over and asked if we wanted any dessert, well I looked at her kind of perplexed because she was supposed to be doing the birthday surprise with singing and ice cream.  then she realized and said oh are you ready for the ice cream now? This was upsetting because we were trying to surprise my son for his birthday.  Next she just brought the ice cream and told us that they were too busy to sing.  That was basically the last straw!!! We did find the manager and explained everything and he still would only discount us $10 from our total bill..... SO moral of the story is as much as we love the food at Red Robin their service is deplorable and I will not give a dime of my money to this franchise until their service problems are rectified!!!"}
{"text":"Bartender/Server Extraordinaire Josie gave us excellent service. Beer was cold, burgers were hot and flavorful."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service, awesome memories. This place is doing it right. Our server was fantastic and on point the entire stay. The dining room was clean and well lit. The food was hot and fresh! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Our waitress Kelly was awesome! She was really friendly and helped us get set up for the rewards program. The ghost burger was fantastic! It really did have a great kick. The atmosphere is very casual. Their tower of onion rings is pretty impressive as well."}
{"text":"I just want to say the few times my boyfriend and I have been here before the service and food was definitely subpar. Not this time!!! If you can request Jeannine as your waitress, DO IT!! She greeted us promptly and took our drink orders right away. When she brought our drinks back we requested fries to come out first and she came right back with two baskets of fries and both sauces that we requested. We ordered, the food came out quickly and was great quality. Before my boyfriend even finished his huge cup of sprite she was already back with a refill. She was so friendly during the whole experience and made it our best experience yet!"}
{"text":"Ya know we have been eating RR for a long time and after today I think I will skip it for a LONG time. Service here is hit or miss, ( San Diego is always good ) and today was a definite miss. I ordered my food with guac on the side and pickles. Never got either because our waitress didn't come back til we were pretty much done. I did get my guac finally and it was too late lol! So the waitress said \"oh my manager took off some for not getting your food right' ha ha we get the bill and he took off a $1.50 on a $10 burger. Why bother RR? I would have rather had nothing taken off because what a joke to do so little when my food sucked!!! The manager is ridiculous and I hope he reads this. Way to take care of your customers."}
{"text":"So this place is right down the street from me and I'm super glad. I come often and receive the best service every time. I'm not sure why such low reviews, I'm greeted immediately my food comes promptly and hot! Some how I always end up with the same waitress Jena, she's great, very patient and gave the best recommendations for a burger my first time around. Even the manager comes over to make sure we're satisfied and full. The drinks are fresh too I have Shirley temples every time and they're always fresh! Meaning it doesn't taste syrupy or as if the machine and or pump is dirty! All in all I LOVE this place! Great crowd and super polite team:)"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with tonight. Me and my mom wanted to go out for dinner and saw they had sweet potato fries and she loves the sweet potato fries. So we got fish and chips and subbed out the regular fries for sweet potato and there was a $1.49 up charge which we were fine with because that's usual. When the food got to the table the fries were in tiny pieces and an extremely small amount I mean so small like for a child. So we asked for another order since they are bottomless, now that's right when we got the plate we asked for them. So we were eating the fish and I let my mom have the fries because I got French onion soup and I was going to just have some when we got the next order. Well we waited and waited and waited and then the waitress came up and said they should be out soon and she's sorry for the wait. Well we finished the fish and still no fries. We are still waiting for them. It was about 10 minutes after we finished the fish that the fries came and when they got there they were luke warm. Not even hot. So my mom went to talk to the manager and she said she would take off the fries like as if we paid a lot for them. Then when she came back with the bill she said she took off the shake for us which was $3.99. I still paid $18 for crap service and crap food. She should have taken off the fish and chips not the shake. I'm a manager as well at a restaurant and I would have either taken care of the meal that was messed up or the whole ticket. That would have made it all better and made me not waste my only night off and not get them a terrible no star review. I wanted to go to BJs but we haven't been to Red Robin in a while so we wanted to switch it up. That was my mistake. We won't be going back there. We got a free appetizer for next time but that doesn't replace what happened tonight. They said they were short staffed in the kitchen but what does that have to do with you taking care of the guest? Our waitress had about 5 tables that had families and she was training someone. She came by once about the fries and that was it. It was sad. I don't eat fries foos either and I was looking forward to enjoying so good fries food and I did not get to enjoy this at all. Next time I'll be going to BJs for some fish and chips. Yes this is a chain and they have all the money in the world and this one guest doesn't matter but it should. I wasted my money. $18 is not just something to use on food that was not good. I hope they figure out some better guest service cause right now it sucks."}
{"text":"It is okay. Nothing really special except the different sauces and unlimited fries. But how much fries can you really eat? lol I still prefer Fatburger or In-N-Out over this place. But I wouldn't mind going back one day"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Had bad service here. Dirty silverware, wife's sandwich was ok but they forgot had to send back to fix. Manager wouldn't really acknowledge us when we asked her something was really rushful!!!
Don't like this location."}
{"text":"Met a girlfriend for lunch who had never dined at Red Robin before. Our waitress was Ren and let me tell you ... she was 100% outstanding. I'm a small business owner and she is the type of employee I would hire in a heartbeat. It's so nice to have your waitress help you order your vegan selection in a burger restaurant !!! Love this place and particularly this location."}
{"text":"It's so dirty here at this location, they said they just had a \"big\" party but no one looks concerned about the tables being messy. The host really tried to sit my party of 3 right next to family of 10 where there was barely even space to move our seats. I asked for a new seating location she stated that \"we still have to clean it\" okay ? Well why didn't you guys clean it before you sat us? Presentation here is horrible, very upset so far."}
{"text":"Service sucks. No attention to detail. Asked for a spoon for my root beer float. He gave me a dirty tea spoon."}
{"text":"Decent prices, very nice waitress. Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I have witnessed with my family twice now the bus boy and a few waitresses making bets and deals and collecting money while on the job In front of customers. Prompt table service and handicapped accommodations :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of corporate chains but it was a last minute decision. Yes the fries are good.  My 4 pieces of cod was beyond greasy.  The ranch dressing tastes water down.  And my biggest gripe had nothing to do with the food. . It's their lack of respect for the rooster sauce. Sriracha should be an automatic. Why not keep a small stock on hand?  Ps if you are a waiter/waitress you should know what I mean when I say Sriracha or rooster sauce. If you don't,then find another field of work. Or take pride in your craft."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Food was great.  Rob is the best server. The manager Kyle was personal and so real!"}
{"text":"Gluten free burger buns!!!!  Need I say more. Any of their burgers can be made with their gluten free burger bun.  And the steak fries are gluten free not powdered with flour for crisping. 
They have a full menu of gluten free items on the red Robin website.  I really missed a complete burger.  Wrapping it in Lettuce was very sad and sloppy."}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant + long wait for cold food + out of toilet paper in bathroom = should have stayed home with my five young sons. This is my second and last time at this Red Robin."}
{"text":"Ugh. I was looking forward to a good burger but unfortunately it didn't happen. I ordered the BBQ boss hog (or something to that name). It was ok but pretty skimpy on the burger patty and the pulled pork. I guess at least the BBQ sauce was good.

Hubby ordered a pig out burger and was told it was the larger of two similar burgers. The burger was smaller than a Wendy's double and he ordered it well done and it came closer to rare. It also came with some veggies which he requested not be on the burger (same as another person in our party). We told the waitress but since we all had our food already we didn't want to have to wait.  She said she'd mention it to the manager and we expected something to be discounted on the bill but there was nothing mentioned or taken off the bill.

The fries were mushy but one basket actually came out hot so those were good.

Our server was very good but the food is overpriced and not that great. We could have gotten tastier food elsewhere at a far better price. Most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Only because I can not give zero stars. I don't get how servers can bring you a drink dripping over the sides and yet not bother to use bar napkins or coasters! 

The menus are filthy dirty! Beer selections are ok but only BLAH domestic beers are on all day happy hour! Really?? Do alternate pricing but don't discriminate against those of us that enjoy a decent beer!

Food... Hmmm. Gourmet burgers? I don't think so. Burgers with thin patties that overcook and with fancy names? That is more like it. Overall, there are other way better options in San Tan and better burger options nearby. 

Would not recommend. I only returned to use up gift cards received."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this Red Robin and it was surprisingly empty for a Friday. There were plenty seat choices available. We were greeted immediately by a friendly and motivated server. After ordering drinks, we perused the extensive menu full of custom burgers and other items. I decided to try the crispy chicken sandwich as I've been eating a lot of grilled burgers at home.  My mom ordered the All-American Patty Melt. Both orders came with bottomless fries, which I learned later is similar to all-you-can-eat fries...yeah!!! Our meals arrived shortly after the orders were taken and were piping hot.  The crispy chicken had a good flavor and texture. The fries were okay, but started to get too cold. They were also very filling so we barely managed 1 bottomless order. The All-American was like a reuben sandwich, but with a burger patty.  Mom said it was just 'okay'.  I loved the Decor, especially the black ceilings and neon signs. It's a cool place and nice place to bring your family or relatives visiting the area."}
{"text":"We came in just before closing with a party of 5. We ordered our food and it was wonderful. But as good as the food was, the service was even better. Thanks Terri for a great dinner."}
{"text":"We had a party of seven on a very busy Friday night. They got us in with only a 5 minute wait. Service was excellent and the burgers were cooked perfectly. Good food, good service and great company!"}
{"text":"Normally this location is a five star place. Around 5:30, early in dinner service, we had a twenty minute wait- not too bad. 
 The burger I got this time, bacon cheeseburger on bun, plus pickles was not as great as one of their specialty burgers. I wasn't feeling adventurous, and for a burger place, I thought a  bacon cheeseburger would be a good place for them to shine. Also, they have a great sense of their customers because any burger can be wrapped in lettuce for low carb or gluten free fans. 
Their milkshakes are priced well, I think it was 3.99 and that's great for Pittsburgh. 
The bathroom was messy for early on a  Saturday night though. 
Finally, they added little computer screens for games you play while you wait for food, but it is also how you pay. We had a problem with our screen, and the waitress helped us, but here's how she did it. She saw our screen had another table's check so she walked over to them, switched screens and gave us the right screen, WITHOUT saying a word to the other table. Shouldn't you explain why you're switching screens, especially if they're playing games and keeping score?  
I'll be back because of past visits' success and great location, free parking."}
{"text":"I am specifically rating the curbside pick up in this review.  This is the second time in a row that this location has gotten my online order wrong.  However, it isn't that they only got my order wrong again, but I called the number on sign when I arrived and the said they would be right out with my order. I had a 5:15 pick up time and arrived at about 5:20. I waited about 10 minutes and decided to call them again.  They said they hadn't started my order until I called, but that they had my order ready and would bring it out.  5 minutes later they brought out my order.  I knew it was wrong, but decided to take it anyway.  (The last time it took them another 15 minutes to get my order corrected and my food was cold). I mentioned that it took 15 minutes after I called and the gal who brought my food out said they must have forgot and that it was their fault.  She then just walked away.  Then, when I got home, one of my burgers was literally charred beyond being edible.  I really don't like writing bad reviews, but unfortunately, I think that it has come to the point that I want to say, \"Buyer Beware.\""}

I am never disappointed when I visit red robin."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here. She had grilled cheese and I had a grilled chicken burger. The grilled cheese was really salty. I don't know if they added salted butter or what. But wow! It was really salty. The place was busy, service was pleasant and I have no big complaints. Just a really salty grilled cheese sandwich for my daughter. She nibbled at the cheese and ate her broccoli and that was about it. I think it's cool that they had tablets available to serve as a distraction for kids while we wait for food. They gave my daughter a balloon, which was really nice. The margarita was good. We rarely come here but have always had a pretty good dining experience."}
{"text":"we come now and again for the root beer floats and bottom less fries the Burger's are OK I had the blue ribbon it was tasty with the blue cheese crumbles cook well not dried out like slot of places the only about this place it doesn't matter what server you get they are so slow to come to you table just have a I don't want to be hare attitude if you like root beer floats and all you can eat fries and deal with bad service thus is the place"}
{"text":"I feel sorry for the servers here at Red Robin as they are going to can all of their busboys in response to the minimum wage hike..."}
{"text":"This place is loud, obnoxious, and always crowded but that's good for us. We have two toddlers (who we try to teach good manners to) so if one has a meltdown it's not a big deal in this loud restaurant. They will bring out a free basket of fries and have balloons which keeps the kids happy. Sometimes you need a place for kids but you don't want to sacrifice the food. Red Robin is perfect for this! Their milkshakes, burgers, and salads are ALL extremely tastey. Their kids items are big enough for my girls to comfortably share as well. Highly reccomended for loud families!!

Also the service has never been bad but hasn't been awesome either. We keep going back for the food though. Yum!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed afternoon drinks here with Nate and were very happy. We had Nate put together drinks using the specials for the all day happy hour and were very happy with the creations. 

 Overall great experience enjoying the outside seating and this beautiful weather"}
{"text":"Great go to place for a good but expensive burger!  Excellent options for kids.  Wish they had regular fries instead of steak fries or a choice of either or.  
Went the evening of 7/4, to eat & then watch fireworks.
Only compliant is that we told hostess that we wanted a table and the he offered us a booths that had a step.  I said but I need a hi chair and he said well then it needs to go here... I said then he would hit his head.  He just looked at me like I was an alien.  Parents right next to us even said, you can't do that!!! With a non walking toddler that would fall out of a unstrapped booster seat, having the baby sit in the hichair his head would hit the edge of the table.  He was annoyed that we again asked for a booth with hi-chair!
Waitress was awesome... Was on top of fries, drinks and gave us to go cups for our sodas."}
{"text":"Service was great as always. The freckled lemonade is delicious! The one with vodka of course! Burgers are great. I tried the fish sandwich this time and it was great also :)  Will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service as always! Southwestern Chicken Salad is on point! The drinks are always consistent and delicious. The Absolut Speckled Lemonade is sooooo yummy!"}
{"text":"I had the mac and cheese burger. The macaroni fell out of my cheese burger when I tried to eat it, so it was a bit messy. I think that the burgers at Red Robin have a distinct flavor that people might get tired of over time if they have too much of it. There might also be a slight charred/grill flavor to these burgers as well. I also had the bottomless fries with my meal. I think the fries can be hit or miss sometimes, but most of the time they are cooked right - where the fries are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I also like the variety of complimentary sauces that come with the fries. I like the ranch sauce the best, and then the ketchup.

We also ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  Solidly good but nothing amazing.  The bottomless fries are good if steak fries are your thing."}
{"text":"Who isn't a fan of bottomless fries! My family and I decided to come her on Saturday (around 6:15pm) and it was slammed. We were lucky to get seated right away since there was only three of us, however the service was a little slow due to the high volume of people, so if you are okay waiting just a tad longer then be my guest going during dinner rush.

I am on this new healthy kick and decided to get a Wedgie Burger, which is replaces the bun with lettuce. Man was this good, never did I think I would like it but I really did. Had my meat medium (with pink) and grilled onions and American cheese.

Red Robin's burgers are always excellent and now I learned that they are still excellent even without the bun!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday about 745 and sat at the bar. Bar was pretty empty and I was by myself.
The bartender was professional but not friendly. I asked a couple questions and she gave me the technical answer. Like... how big is this burger (I then motioned with my hands making a circle for size). She responds... it 4 ounces. I tried to get a size comparison with a visual size again and she says 2 -2 ounce pattys. So like I said professional but not friendly. 
I would give 2.5 stars if it would let me but it didn't."}
{"text":"My wife took me there for my birthday worst service I ever had at any place waiter Chris took our orders never came back not one time manger Emily noticed and took over Chris never grabbed our coins or cheese sticks  they came out with our  burgers food was good then Chris come over say I am sorry for bad service then said the manager made him what the hell is that if I ever go. Back it's becouse manger Emily but at this point I will go to five guys from now on"}
{"text":"Red Robin always has great service, great beer, and fast delicious food! My Bartender Courtney was amazing today. My beer glass was never empty!"}
{"text":"Been here several times now. Food and service is always excellent and I love that they have different bun choices (I get mine wrapped in lettuce). Food always seems to take forever to come out though."}
{"text":"Red Robin has awesome burgers for a good deal!

I enjoy their unique gourmet burgers and I love the concept of free refills on fries. The service is usually pretty good. I come often because of the reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Went for lunch we had the bottomless fries to start very hot and good especially with redrobin seasoning salt . We had a huge portion of the chicken parmasian, took home leftovers. We also had the soup and salad, a little pricey plus very little onions in French onion soup. The service was above averge. We frequent this restaraunt every couple months. Always very consistent. Only complaint prices keep climbing, please run some specials or coupons we might come back more often."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We went there on a Tuesday night and it was nearly empty. The waiter was never checked on us I had to call every time we wanted to get more drinks fries order everything. Great food when it finally came but horrible service"}
{"text":"Was craving Red Robin as it had been a few months since we had been there.    Decided to fight the shoppers at the mall and go.   Got seated right away.  This is why there is 1 star.    After that it went down hill.  The server was friendly and took our order.  We indicated what coupons we brought with us and he said no problem.    Our order comes and we are told that the Mac and Cheese we ordered was not yet ready and was still cooking.    So here we sit with everyone eating and only half the meal for one of us.   The Mac and Cheese comes out and the cheese on the top looks to be tossed on the top and the center is cold.   OK they had just said it was cooking, so why would it feel like it was freshly thawed out.  The top with the melted cheese was hot but that was the end of it.   We sent it back.   By the time the new mac and cheese comes out, the entire table is finished eating as we had shopping we needed to get to.   I asked them to put it in a to-go box.  (Yes so I can take it home and still not get to eat it hot).   Next the server comes to us and tells us that they cannot apply the coupons we brought.  Even though when placing the order we were told everything was good.  We would never have ordered the milkshake had we known that the coupon would not have been applied.  The coupon does not say anything about only 1 coupon can be used per table.  Nor did the server tell us that it could not  be done until after the milk shake was consumed.     Next we go to pay and I check my statement and see that the charge for the meal was charged twice!   I call them to let them know that they ran my card twice and I need it reversed and I get told that I have to wait 10 days and call back.   Oh did I mention that we could not even get anyone to refill the drink until we specifically had to ask if it would be refilled at the end of the meal.    Very bad service given and we were so excited to come here."}
{"text":"Worst service ever...more than 40 min. For food for 14 people..Craig the manager was NO help...meals were wr o ng.  Waiter couldn't figure out the split checks..had to stand at kitchen to get ranch, fries and drink refills.....awful..awful.awful."}
{"text":"We have been visiting this establishment for years and after our visit last night we will never go back again. The waitress was terrible, we had to ask anther waiter for utensils after our meal arrived. We ordered our food before 2 other tables and got our food last. The food came out incorrectly. We asked for a manager and when she arrived she did not tell us she was a manager she asked if we wanted refills on our waters. So disappointed in Red Robin."}
{"text":"Brought the whole family for dinner. Reasonably priced and good service. We all had good burgers and bottomless fries!"}
{"text":"Saturday night. 
2 burger plates and a kids meals took over an hour to be serve. Other parties were seated after and served before us. 
Service was shit. Food wasn't enjoyable  after waiting that long.
Manager only discounted the bill 50%. 

Unacceptable experience! Won't be eating here anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Sadly I don't recommend this location ):  its painful to say.....we have been a few times this past year because it's a good midpoint for us to meet up with friends.  The food is great don't get me wrong but the service has been poor everytime /: last time we went it was busy but nothing crazy, we got a tiny portion of fries and it took a half hour for a refill on fries.  Also my friend ordered a shake and it didn't come until after we finished our meal...would have been ok but we ordered it to come before and at hthe same time as our meal since he wasn't getting a meal.  Also the waitress was nowhere to be seen 75% of the time, she was also VERY cold to us.  I have a hard time because I'm not the complaining type but the service was just really really poor /:"}
{"text":"This place is just mediocre in my opinion.  My husband and our kids like Red Robin, so we probably come here once a month.

The food is just regular American food.  I usually get a bacon cheeseburger.  You can't specify how you want your meat cooked, and that sucks in my opinion.  You can only tell them if you want or don't want pink.  What's not to love about bottomless fries though?  We always ask for an order of fries right away to keep the kids occupied. 

Service is hit or miss here."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to come here all the time. Not this location as I'm from San Diego. However today I was a little disappointed. I love the fries so it's one thing my heart is set on when coming here. The fries were not cold but definitely not hot. I asked for hot fries which I just hate doing because I feel like a difficult customer. New fries came and on first try they were hot but as I ate there were more warm ones. I feel like they just give you fries that have been sitting around under heat lamp mixed in with a few fresh ones so they can get rid of old ones. Yuck. That kind of ruined the whole thing for me. The sever was nice. She may have got a little distant when I asked for fresh fries but was nice when closing out. I feel like none of my issues are because of her. It just makes me wonder how long before I'll come back. P. S. The burger was super good and spicy like I like it. Just one odd thing.... I kept bitting into something hard. ?????"}
{"text":"Poor execution. The fries were cold and hard and old. Service is pretty slow. I would avoid this one on a Friday night. Too bad, I usually like red Robin."}
{"text":"Meal was okay. Afterwards, walking out and staff member walked into me, singing \"Off to see the Wizard.\" He grabbed me from falling as he stepped on my ankle. The gal at the front was laughing hysterically. Still heard laughter as we were walking out door. TOTALLY unprofessional!!!!! Glad she found it funny to see someone get hurt. People need to go through classes on being professional. Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm pretty lenient when it comes to bad service.  However this Red Robin's takes the cake!  

We waited 20 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we got our food!  Come on! That's a lot of sitting around just starving.  I ordered the Wedgie burger (protein burger) and there was a TON of mayonnaise.  I thought \"no biggie, I'll just scrape it off\" 10 minutes later...I'm still trying to remove all the mayonnaise! It was absolutely disgusting!  I almost filled our sauce cup with mayonnaise  

Also, bottomless fries? I swear that was a thing there...but their service was so bad, the table behind us asked for more fries...and it came so late, the server has to ask \"did you still want these\", because they were clearly finished with their meal.  I had the same exact thing happen to me, except nobody asked if I still wanted them...they just dumped the basket onto our table and walked away.

One thing I'm certain of, is that's the last time I'm ever going there.  Not worth it!"}
{"text":"For being out of town great service, food was on time and all you can drink lemonade ..fun place to go for lunch"}
{"text":"Mercedes is the best waitress ever! She takes cares of all of your needs. Brings things to your table before you even think of asking for it. She tells amazing stories and always has a beautiful smile on her face. I always come to this location just to be served by her. The food is amazing also. Btw Mercedes is amazing! Just ask to be seated at her section."}
{"text":"If you've got a burger and bottomless fry craving....Red Robin is the place to go. Good variety of burgers, salads, chicken sandwiches and appetizers.

This visit, as with any other on a Friday or Saturday night, means at least a 20 minute wait and so so service. The place gets so crowded, that it appears the restaurant is always understaffed and the servers are overworked. 

If you want something like mayo or special sauce with your fry's, ask for it way in advance, because nothing comes fast around here.

With that being said, the flavored iced teas are yummy here. I favor the pomegranate, my husband likes the peach. The burgers are yuuuummmmm! Always cooked the way I like them (medium rare) and are really tasty. I like the avocado bacon burger ....bunless, wrapped in lettuce. It's like having a side salad :) The bonzai burger and chicken sandwiches are worth trying too.

We never get appetizers here, we just ask for a couple of baskets of fries for the 4 of us. Holds us over until the burgers come. I always ask for the campfire sauce. No extra charge and oh so good.

Sign up for their rewards card. There are always discounts and free appies....as well as a free birthday burger and buy 9 burgers get the 10th free. Burgers can add up fast with a  big family.

So we keep coming back, not for the slow service, but for the fun atmosphere and great burgers."}
{"text":"Why is there no consistency in your food when it's not a burger.
Had a Caesar chicken wrap today and for $11 bucks you could put some chicken in it. There was 4 small chunks on both half's, the rest was all lettuce and tomatoes. You put the small amount of chicken in the center and when they cut it looks like a fair amount until you bite into it .
I've had it before last month and it wasn't like that. Your not going to save any money if your customers don't return."}
{"text":"Just ate a yummy Tavern burger! It was great . Hot and fresh . Onion ring stack was fantastic."}
{"text":"Love their burgers, but the veggie burger made me sick and I wish they had a black bean burger!  Good fries, but they need a better beer selection"}
{"text":"Food was very good and the service was fast.  I always order the same thing \"teriyaki chicken burger.  Highly recommend it!  I did not give 5 stars due to the fact I also ordered French onion soup and the onion were still a little crisp...not quite ready but it did have good flavor."}
{"text":"So I recall hearing a story on NPR about a reviewer in LA who reviewed all the restaurants on one particular street. It took a couple years because of the diversity and number of places on that street, but eventually he got to all of them. That sounded like a fun project to undertake, so I thought I'd do the same. Picking which street in Madison was kind of difficult, especially since you can stay driving on the same road and it'll change names like 4 or 5 times. I decided to pick one such road: Monona Dr which turns into Attwood Ave, which turns into Willy Street. There are so many great places on this road, some of which are already favorites, but others that I need to get around to visiting and reviewing. Now the journey begins....

It was a snowy December Sunday afternoon when I visited this Red Robin. The snow kept a lot of people away, but the place was still about a third filled. I was greeted and seated promptly. I've been to Red Robins before and I like to think of them as an easy place to go when my sister is in town visiting with her kids. Kids seem welcome here (they even can get a balloon) and since it's already a loud place, I don't mind when my niece and nephew act up (to say I'm not a kid person would be a great understatement). The burgers here are good with fun toppings. My go to is the A1 peppercorn burger which may rival Bob's Bad Breath Burger from the Weary Traveler when it comes to giving you bad breath afterwards. The onion bun along with the crispy onions on top definitely leaves you reaching for some gum after dinner. If you are feeling gluttonous, the never ending refills of steak fries can fill you up. When they are fresh and hot, they are pretty tasty, but if you are looking for crispy fries, this isn't the place for you. They had some boozy ice cream shakes on the menu that looked interesting, but I'm not in the mood for shakes in winter. Overall it's a decent place for burgers and fries if you don't mind that it's loud, there's tons of pop culture crap all over the walls, and that it's a chain. A solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Poor service, ran out of drinks 3 times and waited over 10 min for a refill.   Wanted to ask our waitress Amber,  \"What kind of shop are you running???\"  Very unhappy!"}
{"text":"The salad I ordered was large but uneventful. My three trips to the bathroom (with toddlers) grew more disgusting each time. They are dirty and borderline not up to code (not functioning locks, exposed plumbing, and sanitary napkins everywhere). The bottomless root beer float is great and made up for the less than appealing max n cheese. I'm sick of the same type of Red Robin experience and will be crossing this place off our family list of restaurants... you should too!"}
{"text":"Great Food, we came late and it wasn't busy at all but the service was still slow. But you can never complain about the food. It's always good at any location."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't go here. Beyond horrible service each of the 4 times we have gone. Not sure why we kept torturing ourselves. First off it took a very long time just for our drink order that we had enough time to decided what to order. My husband has a gluten allergy and we always make sure to let our servers know it's an allergy not just a choice. Food took a very long time to come out and no they weren't busy. My sons burger was made wrong, my fish n chips was like they dumped the salt shaker on it and of course my husbands burger had to be remade since it was in a regular bun. When his food finally comes we ask for napkins. 10 minutes later I got up and went to the back and had to grab my own napkins because we kept getting ignored. My husband then had to get up to the bar to get our drinks refilled. I didn't realize this was a serve yourself place. I then ask for a manager and she was a real piece of work. Couldn't offer an apology at all for anything but did amazing at being rude. Mekeyella Parra you need a new job because you suck as a manager. You have no business dealing with customers because you don't know how to at all. Several tables were dirty and there was crap all over the floors. Definitely won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Our service was horrible and the place wasn't even busy.  My salad was missing a main ingredient and then server offered to bring the item to me after the salad was 90% gone.  She didn't bother checking on us until our meals were just about finished.  I guess that way she wouldn't have to make things right.  I never leave comments but this one was definitely warranted.  Also a word of advice - never tell a customer that is waiting that the \"to go\" order was more important & that's why I was left waiting for my drink for 10 minutes...I should've known service would be horrible when she forgot about our table."}
{"text":"Good service. Friendly staff. Burgers was a little sloppy. Had southern charm and was all soggy from all the sauce they put on. Fries always on point."}
{"text":"Good was great - our server Anthony was the best server I have probably ever had - notice when the fries were low, brought drinks before I could even ask for a refill, notice when I was struggling with a half empty ketchup bottle, the guy was just on it all lunch - will defs be back"}
{"text":"I only ding it a star for the singing.  As with all of this style restaurant they do the obnoxiously loud birthday singing that makes you have to pause your conversation and wait, and wait...and...they seem to average 3-5 birthdays per meal that I have there.  How about a little cake and candle and a nice simple, \"Happy birthday!\"

The food is great and there is a variety of dishes...something to please everyone...vegetarians, experimental eaters, the burger guy, and me -- the picky one.   Dan mentioned that he didn't like the fancy stuff -- they actually have a big thing on their menu that asks you to just tell them how you want it -- you can pick out what type of bun, what goes on it, etc.  So...if you don't want a fancy bun, ask for a plain one, no one bats an eye.

They have a dangerous thing -- unlimited french fries.  For a whopping 49 cents you can make them unlimited garlic fries.

Also...if you ask they will bring you a side of onion straws or fries while you wait for your meal...so far they've always been free."}
{"text":"Okay....my review for this one is the same as the other one on Bell...they are pretty much identical except there is more parking at this location....and occassionally you get a distracted server....but for the most part the service is good.

{"text":"Mediocre American cuisine with a confusing menu and lackluster service.  Not even bottomless fries offer enough incentive for a visit"}
{"text":"They have great food here but it is not worth the wait we have waited over an hour for our food and it is not even busy. Sorry but i am not coming here again."}
{"text":"Endless sweet potatoe fries are really what brings me back.  If it weren't for them, I don't think I'd come here.  They are almost always hot and fresh.  I get the veggie burger sub on a few different burgers that all taste pretty good to me.  Service is usually good from the few waiters that have served me there.  If you want bottomless fries and a decent sandwich for a moderate price, give it a go."}
{"text":"The food is good.  Bottomless fries is good.

Love the Royal Red Robin burger.

The problem with this location is the service.  They are just unacceptably slow.  Once you get them order like 4 glasses of water because they won't be back to you for quite some time.

I actually waited an hour and 15 minutes one time for a burger!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Whiskey River bbq Burger well done. Received my bun untoasted, pink undercooked meat, no BBQ sauce. Tried to correct matters by brining me ice cold sauce on the side. Requested napkins and silverware and they bring us dirty napkins.

This location has gone downhill ! Never will return"}
{"text":"Service at the bar was excellent! Sadly, every hour is happy hour I found out when I visited at about 4pm. So glad they dont look down on you or give you worse service for cashing in on a free birthday burger offer. 

2 star missing because the burger came out warm. I mean the burger had no sizzle or steam. ive had fast food burgers hotter than that thing. They offer endless fries but offer about 12 with the entree. Necessitating my request for another round of 12 fries. It seems silly to be honest. Put enough on the first plate so I dont have to ask for more. Jeez oh man. 

Ive loved Red Robin for awhile but with so many other options i wouldnt go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Red Robin, YUM! The burgers are pretty good, the BLTA is great when you hold the A (not an avocado fan). Chesse sticks are pretty tasty and the endless rootbeer float is wonderful! Wait, what?? ENDLESS ROOTBEER FLOAT?? Heaven! Unbutton that top button on your pants and get yer food on!"}
{"text":"I have to say their food is very tasty but when they make SOOOO publicly known that their fries are endless it takes an act of GOD to get them to keep bringing them....my wife and I counted the refill one time and there was literally 13 fries!!!!  A suggestion to you is to have two orders coming at a time and then you can share!  They do have very tasty food as I previously stated and I have had their burgers, chicken, and fish....all are VERY tasty!  The best service I have had here has been in the bar, but for those with children...you are not allowed! This is RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET from the spring training facility so do not attempt to enter after or before this time because there will be a GOD awful wait!!!!"}
{"text":"Still the best (steak) fries in the world! Bottomless, I might add!  The teriyaki chicken burger is fantastic. My husband and I have been taking our children to this location since they were babies! Tonight, my fourth and last daughter, 14 years old, and all of her friends requested to go here for dinner, before their very first high school homecoming dance.  They all had milkshakes, strawberry lemonade, a grilled chicken sandwich, all served a different way, and of course BOTTOMLESS fries!  They even asked for balloons... Awe The place was very busy at 6pm, but we got great service and a pleasant waitstaff.    But! One QUESTION! Why so stingy with the napkins.... I think they have a napkin nazi in the back!!"}
{"text":"So I noticed that they seated all the blacks in the back where the tv's and seating is not upgraded the server \"Brandi\" had a slight attidute and the only reason she got the tip that she did was because my dad was there. they had a new item that my dad tried some roast beef sandwhich that they tried  to make fancy and was over priced. it should have been called roast beef sandwhich with a dip. it will be awile before I come back"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Don't like the food. Came in today for a cocktail. Full bar but no martini glasses? Seriously, it's one of the most classic drinks. Lame."}
{"text":"The last trip did it in for me. I visit frequently and I am just disappointed with this Red Robin now. The one in Independence is a nightmare itself, particularly with customer service and sanitation. I like the North Olmsted location better therefore I try to go to this location. However, this is the end. We were seated by the bar. I do not know why that is always a bad thing but it seems when they ask about sitting by the bar, you should ask for the can instead. You get better service, well... maybe not at a Red Robin as the restroom is everything but a restful experience. The long story short, it is a Tuesday night and I could not lie to you when I say like your favorite local watering hole, apparently this Red Robin has frequent crowds (find a better place honestly). We were also the youngest people by at least three decades. So apparently we are not worthy of being serviced. We ordered and then waited and waited and waited. About an hour and twenty minutes. Then we never saw the waitress again. So refills were not going to happen. She literally skipped our table at least three circulations in a row. I did not say anything inflammatory nor did my friend. I did get refills but it was seemingly in passing as she dropped them off at several tables simultaneously. I gave a 20% Tip but it was not worth it and I am not coming here anytime soon. Red Robin got an email and I got a response which is basically sorry your life sucks but mine doesn't so we will 'contact' the location and have a cheerful laugh and then take a smoke break during which time your experience will not be discussed. So enough of that music."}
{"text":"The fact of the matter is that I do not like this location. I rather drive to North Olmsted where only once I was having an issue. This location has ruffled my drawers many times. The food is fine, but it is this guy named Chris and the last visit. Chris is always by the bar and I purposefully will move sections even if I have to wait when I see his mug. That being said, I have gone here many times and there is always something but rarely anything beyond a ruffling of my drawers. The last trip was good. Starting with Chris, I have this thing which I do not understand. They have a plethora of unlimited options. You can get the unlimited root beer floats, or lemonade, or a soda but that is not an 'and' aka you cannot substitute. So you better enjoy consuming a ton of ice cream if you start that way. To be honest, the location in North Olmsted never seemed to care if I wanted to have a float, then a tea, then a purple freckled lemonade or whatever it is called which is why I flock there. So Chris already ruined any whim of hope for a great Red Robin burger. Then I ordered the Garlic unlimited fries and when the time for a refill came it was you cannot switch, lets kill this fat kid's breathe so that the young lady he is with suffers like Chris's soul suffers when someone smiles. So I got pissed and I went outside and called corporate and found out that the sides CAN be switched but the drinks were not supposed to be. Okay. So the last trip, our waitress was cool and she said that since my dinner mate was getting fries that she would just bring out two so I can get broccoli and then have some fries. That is was cool and I tipped 25% because Nicol deserved it. However, the women that brought out the fries made a face when she dropped off two and saw my broccoli. You make-up laden charlatan, don't judge me. my turkey burger had TWO burgers, far as I am concerned I could have ordered several sides at once. If I wanted to be judged, I would call up my friends. Anyways, Nicol was really good but this Red Robin is just not as good as the one in North Olmsted. The problem of course is that I never drive and this one is a tinge closer to where I live and since I am not driving I cannot pick. 

All-in-all I have never gotten the runs from their food but it would be nice to have some variety in life. If it is a matter of inventory or whatever, then make it so you can list a substitution and credit the orders. it cannot be that hard."}
{"text":"Typical Red Robin burger joint. Great service, food was to be expected. Over priced and not my first choice for a burger. Just didn't wow me."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends for our B-Day month burger via their rewards program.  Just about everything was as expected from Red Robins.  Ok food. Ok service.  My folly comes with their new electronic pay stations at your table.  I do like that they are trying to evolve with the times; however, we had an error occur when we tried to use it.  It took around 20-30 min to get it resolved after dealing with our server, the manager and the third person who didn't even introduce themselves.  My complaint comes from having to take an extra 20-30 min to resolve an issue with their system and then not even getting compensated.  My recommendation,  get your free burger once a year but avoid other wise.  Better burger places in the valley like Giant Hamburgers, Haven Burger or Chuck Box."}
{"text":"Went to red robin at downtown summerlin for the first and last time. Service was bad and so was the food. I was surprised because I have been to many red robins and have always enjoyed my food. I will not be back to the one in downtown summerlin"}
{"text":"Short & sweet. This is the theme for the
review, my waitress Paige & the wait time!
I like it that way! Paige did a nice job waiting on us. There enough but not too much . Stick w/ the burgers you'll be glad u did.  Busy but not so crowded that you
cant get a table. Food there quickly and tasty! Solid lunch stop."}
{"text":"Came in around the end of dinner.  Got seated quickly, service was great, food was good, cleanliness was very questionable! We could see into the kitchen and there was trash all over the floor."}
{"text":"I remember coming to red Robin and being totally happy my most recent visit it was just okay.  Everything seemed overpriced for what it was and they tried to serve me something I didn't order. The best thing was the \"not your father's root beer\".  I usually take pictures of food when I enjoy it or when it looks good.. but that was really nothing to take pictures of.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"first time to this establishment dana was our server I had her order my own food the other two ordered off the menu the food was good the service was good establishment is clean I would recommend this place to anyone I'll come back again"}
{"text":"I would give it one star but they comped our whole bill so I'm giving it two. The drinks were good, had some boozy shake and margarita. The burgers are bad and it took a whole hour to get our food (hence the free meal). It's bad & don't go here. The servers are nice though."}
{"text":"We used to love this place. We go almost once a week, usually during a weekday. Food is great, but service is so so so slow and seems to get slower each time we go in. It takes up to 20 minutes sometimes just to get a refill on fries and then when they finally do come, you get like 6 in a basket. We usually go here because it's family friendly. But I consider family friendly rather timely, in that little ones don't have the patience or capability to wait 20+ minutes for their food. Hoping they get it together soon, because we really do love this place. Just hate spending 2 hours there each time."}
{"text":"Red Robin is always amazing! Big meals for great price and always delicious. Came here on many occasions and was never disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Red Robin for years and am constantly pleased with it. Having been a customer here on countless occasions I would say the 95% of my visits here have meet my expectations and 5% were a little under. As I have said in a few of my other reviews everywhere has its off days.

Being a frequent customer here I walk in knowing what I am gonna get. I always sit down order my drink and a few baskets of their BOTTOMLESS Steak Fries which come with any burger order. I almost never order an appetizer but when I do they are a taste treat :) I have tried 90% of the burgers on the menu and my all time favorite is the Bruschetta Chicken Burger. The Garlic Fries are a great addition to the plate and the burger itself is amazing. Another good choice is the Royal Red Robin Burger. I love eating here the price is right and I always leave stuffed of what I was expecting!"}
{"text":"I'd have to be specifically craving Red Robin to eat at Red Robin. It's not the first place I think when I feel like burgers but when I'm on the Centennial Side of town & I don't feel like any other place, I end up here, just for the unlimited fries. LOL.

Service has been on & off for me at this location. It's not consistent, which is understandable. 

Oh & that bottomless Rootbeer Float. Mmmmm. You got me. Stop it. 

Overall though, I wouldn't say it's my favorite spot but food is alright & I'm okay with that."}
{"text":"As the old jingle says, \"Red Robin.. Yuummm!\"

Bottomless freckled lemonade, rootbeer float & steak fries? How could I not love this place? 

A long Friday at work prompted me to invite my mom, who's never been to Red Robin, out for dinner here just because I wanted to eat my stress away with those unlimited fries. Prior to walking in, I warned mom that it might be a little bit hectic but surprisingly enough, we were immediately seated in a booth in the 21+ area. We had the sweetest server who immediately brought us our drinks. The freckled lemonade is so refreshing! 

We opted for my usual RR favorites: the $5 O-Ring Shorty (Half-order of the onion rings with Ranch and Campfire sauce), the $6.99 Red's Tavern Double (Double cheeseburger w/ the usual fixin's) and the $8.49 Pig Out Style Tavern Double (Double cheeseburger w/ bacon aioli and more bacon) and two sides of the Campfire sauce because I love pairing it with my fries and burgers. 

I guess we got lucky on the service because our server was attentive and the manager brought fresh hot fries for every table without us even asking. Pretty much, mom & I had a wonderful dinner here. Crossing my fingers it'll be the same when we come back next time!"}
{"text":"This is the FIRST Red Robin I had ever been to (earlier this year).  The service is always really good.  Good Veggie Burgers, love the bottomless fries (garlic & sweet potato), cool shakes and mixed drinks.  One of the few restaurants to stay open late in this town!!!  Great place to come after a movie at Harkins."}
{"text":"All of the Red Robin's that I've ever been to have been located inside malls so I was surprised to see one sitting in a vast parking lot with nothing else surrounding it. Very odd indeed. With that being said, I figured that with this restaurant being so randomly placed, I'm sure that it will be completely empty at 2PM on a Sunday. I was wrong. Although there were numerous parties already seated and enjoying their meals and the restaurant looked like it was filled to the brim, we (party of 2 and an infant) were seated immediately. Our server, Rebecca, was great! She had a chipper personality and was always around whenever we needed her with a freckled lemonade in hand. Thank you, Rebecca. You made our experience at this location fantastic! We look forward to coming back and being seated in your area again."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location often but after the last few times I have decided I will no longer be doing so. The food is generally consistent but the service is truly lacking. I see the same bartenders often and the initial interaction is always mediocre at best. As soon as I pay my bill any acknowledgement of me being there disappears. I never receive a thank you for coming in and I certainly feel like me being there is a nuisance. The staff always too busy hanging out at the drink well discussing their person lives. I would rather spend my money at a place that makes me feel comfortable and welcome."}
{"text":"I really like this Red Robin; it's such a nice place for family evenings-out (even for small children). The staff is always nice and attentive and the food is excellent. Plus, who wouldn't love all-you-can-eat fries?!!?!!

We always start with fries with ranch and BBQ sauce while my sons imbibe in bottomless root beer floats. The wait staff is always willing to refill the fries and floats whenever asked.

I always order the Bonzai Burger with a vegetarian patty. I love the flavors and the burgers are pretty big. In fact, I always cut mine in half as soon as it arrives and put half of it in a to-go container (after all, I filled up on fries!). The meatless patty is standard, not a house-made concoction, so not much more than what I could cook at home.

I really like that they encourage family socialization with chalkboard activities and I like the ability to order and check out using an iPad at the table. Best of all, I like that you get a free dessert when you come for your birthday!

On one occasion when my son's order was incorrect, our server immediately re-placed the order. The manager then came to apologize and ask if my son wanted anything while he was waiting. We were very pleased with the gesture. His burger was back (hot and correct) in less than five minutes.

The wait to get a table can be ridiculous. Be sure to come during off-hours so you won't have an hour-long wait."}
{"text":"I admit this review is about a week old but I wanted to leave it in regards to their To-Go service! Last Friday, I was too lazy to cook or go out-out and was craving a burger so I called this location and placed a To-Go order over the phone. When I arrived I told the hostess I was picking up and she sends me to the bar. So I go to the bar and he tells me to go to the hostess and ask for Sabrina. So then I go back to the silly girl and say hey I guess I'm looking for Sabrina and she gives me the homer simpson \"doh\" face and I assume she just might be new and still learning. Sabrina then confirms my order for me, asks for my loyalty card and makes my freckled lemonade to-go fresh! As much as I was in a hurry it did make me happy that my drink was fresh and not sitting there for 10 minutes. The transaction was smooth and of course I couldn't help but tip her for giving such great customer service! If you ever go to this location you better hope Sabrina is working otherwise you might be screwed haha"}
{"text":"I typically like Red Robin, but today I was not a fan. We placed a rather large order from here today and it was a disaster. We ordered it through GrubHub so obviously you would automatically assume the food was going to be delivered right? WRONG!!!! We waited over an hour for our food to be delivered and when it never came we called the restaurant to figure out if they knew when our driver would be arriving to get our food. They apparently had no idea and told us to call GrubHub. GrubHub said that the driver was one of Red Robin's so call them.... instantly I got annoyed because I was getting the run around. While waiting on hold for the lady who works for GrubHub to return with confirmation about our food she then comes back to say that our order wasn't put in for delivery, but for pick up.... so why on earth did the girl at the restaurant say it was going to be delivered? Beats me! So we ended up picking our food up which had been sitting there for apparently 30mins, even though we waited over an hour and I was told it would take 15mins to make? Yeah okay. Our food was COLD!!!! I called Red Robin's to ask for the tip to be refunded and for the COKE THEY CHARGED US FOR, BUT NEVER GAVE US, to be refunded as well. I was then told that I had to call GrubHub because they couldn't do anything for me. I called GrubHub and they said I had to call the restaurant!!!!!!!! Again, the run around. I would seriously give this experience 0 stars, but the two ladies working at GrubHub were really nice and so was Julie, the manager at Red Robin's. Although Julie did openly admit that something about our order seemed off to them when they received it, but they didn't bother checking into it by calling us or GrubHub. Maybe next time something seems off you will actually dig a little deeper instead of serving cold food."}
{"text":"We haven't been to Red Robin for a few years.  We had a great meal yesterday.  The unlimited fries is very cool.  We love the fries.  They offer $6.99 burgers and fries which is what we got. But the best part of our meal was the huge ice cream mud pie.  This pie was so huge, that 5 people could have shared it. And it was so so good.  Also our waiter Justin was super cute and friendly."}
{"text":"We went to Red Robin on Sunday to grab lunch. I ordered the guacamole burger. When it came out, there was little to no guacamole. No problem I thought, just ask for more on the side. We had to flag down the waiter after 5+ minutes of sitting there because no one checked on us. After bringing it to his attention, he said he would bring some more out and started walking away in a frustrated, hasty manner. We tried to stop him as he walked away to ask for more drinks and he said sure. We then tried to stop him again during this same exchange and ask for more fries. He turned and said okay and kept trying to walk away, but we didn't even have everything we needed. The last party member tried to ask for more of her side and he kept walking. We see him slam some menus into the menu holder by the host. 

After 3 or so minutes, the guacamole came out, so now the burger has been sitting for around 10+ minutes and is now room temperature. It was flavorless, bland and quite pathetic for a chain that claims they have amazing burgers. For $10, it should have been a much better burger. It was the worst burger I can remember eating in the last few years. We were able to then ask him for our side of broccoli, which he just replied \"sure\", without any hospitality or sincerity. The broccoli then came out in about 10-15 minutes, after we were all done for our food. The manager did come out and apologize for the wait for our side of broccoli, and seemed sincere. I wish she was our waitress because we probably would have had a much better experience. 

The only time we received service was when we had to ask for it. Other than once, we had to keep asking for our refills. Even when we waited for the check, we found ourselves just sitting there without any attention. It was the first time in a very long time I have tipped below 15%, this service was abysmal. I feel I could have made a \"how to give poor customer service\" video and used it to train servers on the don'ts of hospitality. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant and probably the last time I will ever willingly dine at a Red Robin."}
{"text":"Garlic Fries great!  Service was lacking.  Long wait on drink refills.  Waitress barely paid attention to us."}
{"text":"We were prompted to our seat right away staff is great always moving our waitress was very helpful & informative I let her pick my fries she got me the sweet potato fries it went great with the Banzai Burger with mushrooms and jalapeño it was insane.... thanks"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was terrible. The waitress was rushing us to leave from the moment we sat down. I went with my daughter and wife and she didn't want to get my daughter her drink. She never checked up on us. When I asked for a order of fries she looked mad about it. While we where still eating she was telling us how to pay the pay check. Five minutes later she came back and asked if the machine worked and if we payed yet? I told her we are still eating and then she came back several times after that asking about paying the pay check. It got to the point that we felt uncomfortable so we payed and left. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Brendon is the best waiter EVER! Brought refills without us having to flag him down. He was fast, friendly and easy on the eyes. Give that boy a raise!!"}
{"text":"The food was \"ok\". The service was not. The restaurant was dirty. 

Our waitress was not as attentive as she could have been, and she was not knowledgeable of the menu. My second visit here since the \"grand opening\", and each time has not been pleasant. Certainly there won't be a third visit - third time can't be a charm in this case."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Red Robin for many years. Unfortunately the service at the Centennial location was horrible. Bethany, our server, was slow, rude, and dismissive. Every time we asked a question, we got vague, half-answers and an annoyed demeanor. I love the food, but I don't know if I can give it another chance."}
{"text":"I give one star to my waitress and the other star to the food.  My waitress was very responsive and friendly while the food came out quickly and was very tasty.  Now, with that being said I'm taking two stars away for cleanliness and one additional star for value.  

With regard to cleanliness, our menu had a large hair stuck to some type of greasy substance.  Both the menus we were given felt like they hadn't been cleaned in some time.  They were straight up nasty and should be cleaned daily and as needed.  Also, the laminated drink flier on our table had a large smear of ketchup on it.  The next cleanliness item my son pointed out to me was that our table had several pieces of gum affixed to the underside.   Also, when we looked at the window sill that set against our table there was old food particles all along the length of the window.  The table also had a greasy/grimy feel to it, I believe the table finish could be the the culprit mixed with whatever cleaning chemical they use and when they combine the two there's a sticky feel to the table.  In sum, with regard to cleanliness the managers at Red Robin Independence fail to hold their staff to cleanliness standards and ensure that front of house tasks are completed on a daily basis.  There's no reason these managers can't hold their employees accountable especially when staff seem to have time on their hands as they converse in the bar area (not all the staff were lounging, just a few).  Instead of lounging they could be cleaning menus, tables, and the floor. 

My last star being taken away is for \"value\", I had $30 tied up in two burgers, fries, diet cokes, and a tip.   The burger was better than a whopper and Big Mac (I like both); however, the fries were equal to fries at McDonald's and Burger King.  Thus, I'm left paying three times as much for a slightly better product in a store that has cleanliness .  Not a great value...my recommendation is to hit a fast food burger chain and skip Red Robin independence until they get the cleanliness fixed so their \"atmosphere\" can show value for their products, that's the only way they can improve unless they reduce prices to match their lethargy for cleanliness. 

Best of luck Red Robin Independence, I could tell there were some good people there...you guys just need a good leader..."}
{"text":"Only go to them in WA and OR!!! The concept is there, but the Mid-west is not up for the task of upholding the high standards of YUMMMMM!!! If we could import West Coasters the food and SERVICE might be way better. So Sad, will have to go to OR to eat Red Robin."}
{"text":"Worst burger place ever!!!
Are waitresses actually said she needs to go tAke her medication for anxiety.  This place is insane!!"}
{"text":"Came here last Tuesday before seeing a movie and man, the kitchen is SLOW! We had Pam as our server and she was the sweetest lady ever, if we do decide to come back hopefully we get her again. The food was decent, but it took SO LONG to receive, even our \"fry refill\" took 20mins! We got there at about 7pm or so and were out of there at 9pm right before our movie was going to start. The manager did comp us the dessert we had ordered and waited 30mins for and my friend did the free burger deal so all we paid for was my entree and our drinks but for having to be there for 2 hours when it usually takes 30mins maybe an hour at a restaurant was crazy! We are so lucky we didn't miss our movie (just barely) otherwise that would have made the entire experience even worse than it already was. We also sat in the bar area where this drunk guy slammed his glass down and it broke, luckily it didn't hurt us but that was awkward. Come on Red Robin, get it together!"}
{"text":"My family and I go here all the time. The waiters and managers are very friendly and helpful. The food is always fresh, its never cold or soggy. There's a good selection of burgers which range in price but they're mostly not expensive and the majority of them come with bottomless fries. I like to get my fries with a side of campfire sauce which is also delicious. 

Everytime I've been at this location I've been seated almost  right away,  in the times that I did have to wait it was max 10 minutes. Overall, great service and great food."}
{"text":"Update.  Sadly Red Robin has completed their transformation into a burger and beer joint.  I have been coming here for years with my kids, now I don't think I will visit after today.  They changed the menu just yesterday, this would be good to know prior to being seated. If you want to be a beer and burger bar, post the menu outside the door just like all other bars.  As luck would have it, the stuff I normally order is no longer offered. I totally get that, change is always good, but maybe you can let your customers know up front. 

Of course, once I ordered something, the server told me they were out of eggs? Seriously, does Las Vegas have a shortage of eggs? Easter has long past, I think they have been restocked.  

Service sucked. I will let certain things slide if the service is great, not today Red \"Fail\" Robin.  

My money is going else where."}
{"text":"Brought my 3 teenage daughters here for dinner.  The last time we patronized this location I was less ham impressed with the service. This time the service was better.  The food came out in a reasonable time and the drinks were refilled.  I highly suggest joining their loyalty club if you eat here. Like them all, you gain points he more you eat.  In addition, Red Robin will automatically discount your bill if you have enough points for a reward. It's simple and painless."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  Noonish.  It was pretty busy.  Service was pretty bad.  Food arrived at table in a seemingly reasonable period of time.  Fries on one plate were absolutely cold.  Fried on other plate hot.  Ordered some onion rings that never arrive.  When server was asked she said she forgot to put the order in.  Never even an offer to refill drink glasses.  Food was no more than average.  Not was we've experienced at other Red Robin's.  Will likely pass on these guys in the future."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Not a good value for the money. Food is mediocre and tasteless 
The service is poor also. I would not recommend this restaurant. Mc Donald's is better and I don't like that place :(
Who ever heard of restaurant not having coffee????"}
{"text":"Red Robin is so good. Great burgers and so many different kinds. Are they the best in the world? No but they are really good. Awesome fries too. You can have all you want but I think I have only ordered a fry refill once. Great fish and chips too. Yes a burger place that has other stuff too. Don't forget the milkshakes either. They bring you the metal mixing tumbler as well so you get a refill.
Good selection of beers as well. Of course, you can't really have a beer when you  are on a lunch break from work.
Staff is friendly. Service is good. Food comes out pretty quick. One complaint about this location is they don't participate. All commercials say at participating restaurants and you think they all participate. Well guess what this one doesn't. So not all of the corporate promotions are available here. The big one is the rewards card. Which wouldn't be a big deal but when I want my free burger on my Birthday I can't go to this location I have to go to the one by the Chandler Mall. Just a minor annoyance.
On a side note Red Robin is one of the places you can still get free food on your Birthday. You just have to sign up for their rewards card. Not a big deal for free food.
I do remember a while ago they had this new burger that I just loved the first time I tired it. I think it has pastrami on it and some other stuff, details have faded from memory, but it was really good and I was so sad when they took it away. Darn those limited time teases.
Sure it is a little more than your fast food drive thru burger but it is worth it. I will always go back again."}
{"text":"Great place to go eat! Food is great....Husband had the Whiskey River burger and I had the Royal Red Robin burger....yummy!  Fries are always so good and today's waitress Nikki was really attentive and funny.  The ambiance is great and you can usually see one of mm any sports events!"}
{"text":"Went last week for my daughter's birthday. We've been to this one a hundred times, but this time our service was less than stellar. Actually it was less than standard. Our waitress must have been new... When it was time to ask us if we wanted dessert, we told her it was our daughter's birthday and she said something about that and ran off. Ummmm...don't you normally ask the other 5 people at the table if they want something? Or were we all supposed to share the birthday sundae???

I guess we shouldn't complain. At least RR gives a bday sundae. Food this trip was good, as usual. I love the California chicken sandwich, but for the life of me, can't ever get through the whole thing without it falling all over the place. It is deceivingly well-wrapped when it arrives, but then goes to hell after the first few bites! 

Has anyone noticed the amount of fries you get (in the unlimited baskets) averages like 6-8? Inevitably, we ask for at least another 2 baskets while waiting for our food to be cooked. What's up with that? Would save time if they just brought more to begin with AND give us one less thing to complain about.

As we predicted, it took a LONG time to pay. Hello wait staff:  you know that your tip decreases with each minute we spend waiting..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the service here. Everyone is so up eat and friendly. Bottomless drinks and fries are a great deal. The cod sandwich had my taste buds in an uproar and for the for the first time in years my daughter finished her entire chicken sandwich. The passion fruit tea and the raspberry limeade were delicious. Definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This was a good experience and definitely sit in the bar at this location. I say that because that's where the better service is. This is the 4th or 5th time at this location but wanted to write this review because the previous experiences were so so. This everything was great and credit to Sabrina. She was very attentive and filled drinks when needed and brought more fries a few times when necessary. That's the reason I'm writing this today because it needs to be recognized versus the negative from prior times. Anyway when I go back I'll always go to the bar area and hope for a similar experience. Everything was good and timely and no complaints at all"}
{"text":"Enrique Rocks!!!!

My family and I have been loyal Red Robin fans for 11+ years. Since moving to Las Vegas, we have experienced some spiraling downhill issues with the Red Robin in Centennial Hills, This is the closest location to our home. 
I must say, after two bad experiences that you can re about here on Yelp, we decided to go one final time to see if things were corrected. 

So after 4 adults, and 15 kids are seated, here comes Enrique. Huge smile, knows my family and knows how to remain calm under pressure. This man deserves a promotion. If he was to train the staff, whether new or old, this place would be untouchable. He was on top of drinks, fries, refills, and the food order. All of our food came out in a timely manner and was accurate to the \"T\". (Plus, everyone received their food at the same time).

Again, Enrique needs to be the lead trainer or manager because he is incredible. Hats off to you Enrique, and we will be seeing you again soon as we will be requesting to sit in your section on our next visit."}
{"text":"Their online menu is really nice if you are gluten free (it is easy to follow). They also are cool about wrapping your burger in lettuce and don't upcharge you for asking for no bun. Wow. 

Anyways, the burgers are HUGE and to die for. Even if you can eat a bun, you should still get it without one so you can finish the burger. 

I must admit. I went to Wendy's today and realized I like their burgers just as much and they are much cheaper."}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with the food here.  The service is probably above average.  I've had lunch here a few times.  But somehow I have always left here feeling as though I did not get good value."}
{"text":"Lately, they been slipping. Screwing up the orders most of the times bringing what's called bottomless fries, I actually counted them and it was 6 fries. I started to laugh because of what they advertise and what they bring. Burgers are awesome but lately that quality and taste is coming into question;(:("}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!  Wednesday night, 08/17/16, 7pm. 

Chili Con Queso appetizer....came out ice cold, had to send it back. 

Wife had a grilled chicken sandwich with Mac n cheese as a side instead of fries.......Mac n cheese came out ice cold, had to send it back. 

Peppercorn bacon cheddar burger for myself with garlic fries.  Fries were bland, ate maybe 1/4 of them.

Overall my burger was average, at best!  Nothing special and surely not worth the 20 minute wait to be seated. 

Service was crappy!  Had to ask for everything 2 or 3 times because \"Ashton\" kept forgetting. 

Bill was $50 after tip....and for what, burgers?  No thank you!  Never coming back!  

I could of had a nice steak dinner for that cost!  Soooooo not worth the hype or the cost of eating here. If you're looking for a great burger, go to Farrens, downtown Champaign.  I wouldn't eat here again if it were free. It's just not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"We went here with a group of 7, overall pretty disappointing compared to other Red Robin's I've been too.  My tea was watery, and my Royal hamburger with a egg on top was cooked over easy. The minute you squeezed the burger you ended up with a yellow sloppy mess. My experience is the eggs are always cooked over hard. 
Another person in our party had the veggie burger, it was dry and tasted poorly."}
{"text":"The last time I came here, I ordered a burger and I was unhappy. I came with my family, and all of our burgers were still pretty pink/red. I know it can be hard to do well done sometimes, since it can be hard to tell. But we all asked for well done, and then all turning out like that? I was sick to my stomach after, having trying to eat it just to see if I could and not to cause a problem. The service is great and everyone is really happy and stuff. But I won't be returning here or any other for a long while. They didn't really help us with or meals and how upset we were. Everything else was great though!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the only reason we go here is because of our kids. It's a typically decent experience. Big warning that the help is pretty much apathetic and useless and you will have to ask for everything like free refills on your sodas. Also I've never been offered crayons and coloring sheets for the kids -- I have to ask once we're seated. (Tip: if you see a couple come in the door with exasperated twin two-year-olds, it would be nice to offer some crayons, balloons, etc. Parents would love that.) I also told hostess they need to clean the windowsill near our booth because it's so dusty... she just said \"oh OK\" and didn't offer any apologies. Honestly this could be a superb place that would get a lot more business and revenues if they just cleaned up their act and got some training for their staff. On a high note, it's a great location that's typically clean with easy parking and very clean bathrooms. I particularly appreciate the low sink for kids."}
{"text":"Food was great but I thought I was so convenient to pay at your table until I find out that the waiter messed things up and I paid for someone else's food and I have to pay the difference. It made me sort of mad. He was a nice guy but seemed like he didn't know what he was doing."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the Red Robins in Illinois, but this particular store, on this particular night, was marginal at best.  Burger were dry enough to suck all the moisture out of my mouth, and all our sammiches were very light on the condiments.  Definitely not worth the price, and not coming back.

We DID eat at the one on Sunset four years ago, and it was tasty, but if they're both overseen by the same district manager doubtless that one has gone downhill too."}
{"text":"I don't say this very often but I wish you could give this Red Robin less than a star review because honestly that is what they deserve after being treated the way me and my family were today. We came on a Sunday afternoon, which is most commonly rush hour for a family restaurant during this time. We checked in with the staff and were told it would be anywhere between a 20-30 minute wait as expected. Time went by and other families and people who walked in got seated before us. It was expected as we came with a large party (9 adults and two kids). Well past the wait time we check in and we are told it would be another 15 min. We continue to wait as everyone gets seated and the staff has yet to check in with us about an updated wait time. Again after 15 min we check in and nothing. So about close to hour passes and we are still waiting. At this point we are all hungry and tired of waiting. We ask the staff again and now the moved up the time to 20 min. In which point I ask to speak to an immediate supervisor or manager and again we are told we have to wait to speak to them. We ended up leaving because NEVER have I experienced a wait that long for a party of 11. RIDICULOUS. And to be told to wait to speak to a manager as well was the tipping point for us. I really do hope to speak to someone in charge at this Red Robin because how me and my family were treated was totally UNACCEPTABLE. I will also be contacting them directly and expecting to hear back from someone immediately"}
{"text":"As I mentioned earlier on Olive Garden, we didn't want to wait for at least 50 minutes to sit down then order and wait .... We decided to look for somewhere else close-by.  We were asked earlier by a lady where Red Robin, so we thought we could check that out.  Yes, we did.  OK, typical American food, burgers... The place looks amusement park, good, very lively, like a pub, we are very welcomed. Lots of families that means he price has to be affordable.  No waiting time.  We were hungry so we took it.
Every American restaurant offers the same kind of menu... So needless to say.  Price is alright.  We had steak dips comes with side, but the extra side looks real small not same as the server said, I like sweet potato fries and wings, beer to chill down. When someone is hungry, we can shuffle down anything.
The sweet potatoes fries were not burnt but kind of cold, I perferred not to complain as it might have been out of microwave warm up.  Unless they fry new sweet pototaes.
The dip was good.  But the wings were dried.  I also saw that the celery was dried on the ends and the skin.  I told my friend I guess the chef must be American African.  He asked me why?  I said, I travel and I love cooking.  African love fry food but most of them over-cook and they are dried. American chef cook mostly frozen meat.  Asian cook fresh meat and always juicy (there's a secret to it).  So when we finished, I asked our server Turdy, a sweet young lady if the chef is American African, she said yes and asked how I could tell. I just told her about the food. 
Anyway, the prices for other food were acceptable for the quality....
Since more families customers, their cleaners really have to stay on top of that, otherwise, it can easily spoil the image.  I like the place to come with children on regular basis."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Red Robin in a very long time i went this past week and was not disappointed. I remember going there all the time growing up but it had been a while since i had been. When i went this last time i got the blue ribbon burger. it had a patty, with blue cheese crumbles and fried onion stings, then all of the fixings. I thought it was an incredible burger. Then the stake fries that had where great and they kept on bringing them out. One of my friends that came with told me that i had to get their honey mustered to dip my fries in. Their honey mustered was perhaps the best honey mustered i have ever had. Defiantly try it, after all it is free."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say first about this Red Robin, but this location has bad customer service. Right when I walked in the hostesses did not welcome us with a smile and they were talking amongst themselves for 2 minutes and they just had really bad attitude. I don't know if their day was horrible or what but they were just really rude. And the waiter seemed like he was not having a good day as well. The whole environment at this location just seemed bad. The food was okay just like any other Red Robin.
All I can say is that if you want to come to this Red Robin at this location, beware of the terrible service!"}
{"text":"Not a good place to watch the NFL. Bar was empty and I asked bartender to swotch games. He says they pnly have 2 games available.  Weird."}
{"text":"Food with good services bad went there for my free birthday burger told the waitress when I get there when they got the bill and wanted to use my free birthday burger she came back and said oh that not that burger wasn't one of the free ones."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service and screwed up my order and wanted me to wait twenty more minutes so they could get it right. Most disappointing meal ever. Hostess tried to give me a half eaten cup of fries as compensation. I will make sure everyone I knows hears about this."}
{"text":"First mistake:  showed up for dinner

Second mistake: attempted to have our party of nine, to be seated in bar in order to accelerate the dinning process due to one individual in our party having to leave early for the airport. 

Third mistake:  hostess advises me that Red Robin corporate policy trumps Arizona state policy of under age people not being allowed to dine in their bar arena.  Whereas state of Arizona does allow this process to take place. 

Bottom line:  stay away from this low hanging fruit, blue color poor excuse of a restaurant.  They caused undue stress and provide zero latitude for the customer.  

The customer is never right at Red Robin. 

They owe stars."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch with my family and the service was terrible. They were busy, but had a lot of staff. It took forever to get food and the burger I received was super well done and very crispy. Would not recommend going to this location."}
{"text":"Love eating here! Delicious. We've gotten good service every time we've been there (besides this most recent time but I won't count it because I like the place so much!) =p"}
{"text":"It is really crowded today and it dos hinder the service.  Took over 20min to seat 2 people.  Food service was slow and they forgot my special sauces. 

Food: my gluten free bun was gross though the royal burger was really good.  The chicken wrap was an 8 out of a 10.  Fries are always the bomb! Got the stack O'ring for the first time.. love the thick cut onion and the beading vs. Batter. Yumm!"}
{"text":"Went to eat out with the family and had a good time. When we got our food everything looked great. But my food was actually like warm and my fries tasted old and reheated. I'm only giving 3 stars because our server Justin was great and so nice."}
{"text":"This is a generous 3 Star review. Let me start with positives... we walked in on Saturday, no reservation but were still promptly seated and the hostess was super sweet. She was busy, seating guests, cleaning tables but was always smiling. Our server was great,  and so was my husband's black and bleu burger with sautéed mushrooms, caramelized onions and bleu cheese sauce and crumble. 
They do have a decent kids menu, burger was decent but the side of fruit was just terrible.. it wasn't fresh fruit, so icky my son could barely swallow. 
I have always enjoyed their Ghost burger and if you love hot, this is the one you want. However they changed their veggie patty and the new one is so chewy, dry and hard. The other bummer is if you order ghost burger on veggie patty, you have to pay for the Big ghost which is $11.50 and not $8.50. 
The restaurant is not that clean, dishes are not clean, silverware needs serious upgrade. For the price, this place needs to upgrade their cleanliness and dishes. My burger was served in a little basket, I would normally think that's for fries but they managed to put the big ghost and fries in this little basket, wonder how they expect us to eat. Had to request a plate which wasn't clean and was soaking wet. Ewwww"}
{"text":"Being a childhood favorite I was really excited to go here again. But from the minute we walked in there was no hostess to greet us, a server walked by and made no attempt at getting us a hostess. After about 5 minutes we finally got seated.

Boyfriend ordered the Black and Bleu which was decent and I ordered the Taco Tavern double which was an utter disappointment. What should have been two patties, lettuce, guac, salsa, and tortilla chips came out looking like a double cheeseburger from mcdonalds with a few pieces of lettuce a pitiful teaspoon of guac, and cheese- my salsa and tortilla strips were nowhere to be found. 

We told the waiter who then got it taken care of, but even with the missing additions now on the burger I couldn't get over how this burger was one of the worst I've ever had. Salsa tasted like the bottled ones from the market. There was such a small amount of lettuce that I forgot it was there. Guacamole? What Guacamole? And the patties were even level with mcdonalds. The best thing was probably the cheese. 

Bottom line, we will not be going back as the night ended up being nothing but a disappointment."}
{"text":"It's just another hamburger with some exta options. So be prepared to drop some cash on a burger."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today to start off the service was not great the waitress would disappear and when she did come around if you ask for a refill or more fries a smart-ass remark was to follow .I ordered prime rib dip sandwich and my coworker ordered the chili cheeseburger. When his hamburger came out the chili look like it was four days old ,I've seen better chilli come out of a can. I asked him if you need a fork and knife to eat it and he told me no the chili was like glue and everything stuck together .My sandwich was ok the bottom was soggy  and you could tell it had been sitting for awhile . The french fries seem like they were cooked and left in a warmer for hours . I ordered a second batch of fries thinking they would make them fresh I was wrong same crappy fries. You also only get apparently eight fries with every order, but they claim endless fries. Needless to say I will never go back the food was crap as well as the service . Save your money and your time get a burger from Wendy's before you go here. They're just lucky there's no negative stars on these reviews. Their motto should be Red Robin run."}
{"text":"Outrageously long wait for our food. I clocked it - 33 minutes from when our waiter took our order. We waited 5 minutes AFTER we were done eating for the \"bottomless fries\". Other waiters were bringing fries out before people even got their food.  I spoke to a manager twice, she ended up comping the entire check.  I do think it was an issue with the server as I didn't observe a restaurant wide problem and it was a very busy afternoon. Kudos to the manager for stepping up and doing her best to fix the situation. The burgers were great btw."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. The atmosphere has much to be desired. Noisy and chaotic. Multiple music systems. Timers/beepers going off in the kitchen. The decor in main dining room is uninspired. I like the bar area
better. 
So we like the clam chowder and you can substitute/ upgrade a side to this. The fish and chips are worth a return trip.
The service is on the slow side. We watched our food sit under the heat lamp for a few minutes :(
For a slow night, they were super slow!!!! I counted 17 patrons. Don't know what took so long. 
We talked to the waitress and manager. A check adjustment. In all fairness, I don't think it was a waitress problem, she seemed quite capable. We heard her telling the cook staff that her orders were incomplete. So it was probably a problem behind the steam table. We will come again, but will ask to sit in a quiet part of the DR!"}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner on the 4th of July. Sat outside, the food was great and our server Maryann was awesome!
Love this place!"}
{"text":"If I could have given today's experience negative stars, I would have.

The food was average. Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet.

From the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were \"going to need a high chair for that?\" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter.

We were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left.

She knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us.

In this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them.

Another server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal.

We go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food.

At no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back.

I'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out.

I guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable."}
{"text":"food was great waiters don't pay much attention you have to call them over in order for them to notice you need something"}
{"text":"So, this is a surprise given the other reviews.  So we will just start with the positives.

Waitress was awesome.  She did a great job and helped us out in the decision making process without being snooty. 

They now offer a side salad in the 'bottomless' space.  So do not need to get fries.  This was a bonus.  It is a small side, so keep the expectation in check, but unlimited.

Pub burger is new to me.  So smaller patties, about like 5 guys but good flavor and about $4 less.  Not much difference in size to be honest.

Regular burger was good as well.  All flame broiled.

Fries were pretty good.  Hit and crispy.

Now, the down side.  Their Yukon chips were not good.  Under cooked in places and cold.
Also, got charged for playing a game on the table device.  Upsetting side was that no one knew we would be charged.  There was no option to play at a charge. So be careful."}
{"text":"I have come to this location a few times!

The atmosphere is always vibrant and welcoming. I love this location. The hostess is very attentive and friendly upon arrival each time. The staff are very personable and dedicated while you are in the restaurant. 

I have sat at both the bar and in the restaurant portion of the location. The bar is good when you are in more of a hurry. I can't remember the bartenders name when I went, but he was very attentive and comical. The manager came out a few times just to make sure that everything was going okay during our dining experience. 

I bring my parents here whenever they are craving a burger and (endless) fries! I would definitely recommend this location to anyone who is craving a red robin burger or just a burger in general.

FYI: I had the royal red robin burger with an egg. It was so good! However, ask for extra napkins because it can get messy, lol! Keep up the great work at this location and I will continue returning."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Red Robin.  The burgers are consistently good, and they are a good value.  And the greatest three words in the language: unlimited steak fries!"}
{"text":"We sat in the bar which was self seating and were helped by \"Brianna\". She took our order in a timely fashion and had great customer service. But I am a picky customer And you have to go above and beyond to be noticed by me.
I wanted to try a Cosmo and Brianna suggested some flavored vodka! The drink was excellent and I felt that the experience was catered to me specifically! What. A great thing to go to a restaurant and still feel catered to. 
I have to say the customer service that would be required to turn a franchised place like red robin into a comfortable environment that felt like an episode of \"Cheers\" is a level of customer service that not many can accomplish, but Brianna did it with style! 
I hope management will recognize and asset and pore within! 
A 5 star review on customer service alone is a rarity from me."}
{"text":"So we drove across town to eat Red Robin's bottomless fries. Once we placed our order we were told they were out of fries? Crazy huh? A restaurant thats known for great burgers and fries? Thats just like KFC running out of chicken. What a great disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"My brother took me here last week for my birthday, prior to this visit the last time I ate at a Red Robin was well over 12 years ago. The southwest burger, forget what it was called, was absolutely delicious. The beef patty was a man sized portion, it was juicy meat and everything seemed so fresh. The waitress forgot a couple things, but was absolutely on top of everything with quick service and a bright positive attitude. I will visit back this location on a regular basis, I can't believe I neglected eating here for this long."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a burger and a beer. Corey was our waiter and he was very friendly. I had the whiskey bbq burger and it was delicious!! And you have to try the campfire sauce!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 last night. One server in our entire side of restaurant. Server looked like a guy off the street. Black tshirt untucked looked like a slob. When he finally got to our table after 10 min and asked how we were we said good, how about you and he tells us how he's tired. Forgets drink for one of us for over 5 min. 35 min later takes our order. Forgets one order and claims he dropped it in the kitchen and they're remaking. Brings us another tables extra fries order by mistake, forgets to bring any silverware or plates so we ask a passing manager so we can eat our appetizer. 2 hours for a dinner of burgers because of the crappy service. We live a mile away and probably won't be back. Too many other options to put up with that attitude and service.  Sad thing the manager never came by our table, she made eye contact with me several times as she looked up from one table of two woman that she visited at least 5 diff times. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was slow on a nonbusy night.   The bottomless fruit was good but overpowered by the apples (obviously because they are the cheapest fruit). The bottomless fries were very skimpy to the point where they may as well just offer/serve one healthy order of fries. It was okay."}
{"text":"Came here tonight and it was the epitome of \"Meh, I've experienced better\" which is why I am rating it as such. We also came here before grocery shopping as I make note not to shop on an empty stomach after my $150 Whole Foods extravaganza of 2010, and because I was lazy due to not being able to cook with no food, thus we came here. I wish I would  have known what was coming or else I would have taken the effort to make a much more satisfying meal at home. 

As a vegan, there are very few things I can order and I do not think my order is too complicated in the least, but our waitress just did not get it right. In fact our waitress is the reason why this visit was especially horrid. We had to ask for EVERYTHING, while waiting forever to ask it as she disappeared at full-on ninja status most of the evening. We had to ask for silverware, ketchup, refills; the works. The burger I had did not come out with how I ordered it, and when they did get it right it was just - bland. I know that they microwaved my Boca patty which is fine, but I felt like they microwaved the mushrooms I had on top as well. They were supposed to be sautéed! It was not a satisfying meal, and we were also there for an hour and a half. A meal like that should not have taken so long, but our waitress was nowhere to be found for a majority of it. 

The service and quality is usually decent, but tonight it was horrific. It really makes me not want to go back anytime soon. Next time I will break my rule and shop first, cook later. The headache from this visit was not worth the effort I would have put into a much tastier meal at home."}
{"text":"This location is a very good one! I have been here numerous times and have had great experiences here overall. They are usually pretty busy, but that's a good indication. Despite the usually busy place, the servers stay on top of everything and are attentive. If you ask, they will provide French fries while you wait for your order. They ensure drinks are topped off and they pay attention to small but important details I care about. The servers will check on the tables during the meal to ensure everything is going well. I always see management walking around and making efforts to ensure everything is satisfactory to customers. This is the type of service that makes me a return customer time after time. I am part of the \"rewards\" club, so every 10th burger or meal is free. It's a cool perk, but optional. A visit here could add up a little on price, but you're getting a delicious quality gourmet burger, so it's ok with me."}
{"text":"Sat next to dirty tables in the bar area for our entire visit. We had to ask for a table that was dirty to be cleared. They cleared the one table only left all others. No one cleaned any of the other tables. The pretzel bites are fried bread and cheese whiz. The grease on the plate was brown. It was repulsive. Seriously use to love this place growing up. Went on their website to share my comments before posting here, the website doesn't have any place for comments or suggestions, really?"}
{"text":"We were seated in a booth of our choice quickly. Drink and lunch order was taken promptly. Our food came out so fast and hot it was like they already had it waiting! Unbelievable. Our server was happy and polite. The manager even checked on us a couple times. Great food and service. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Red Robin is highly underrated for their burgers and bottomless fries. The bar area is perfect during football season and almost always open with no wait."}
{"text":"Whatever they can serve that's been taken out of a box, freezer, can, jar, or package is what's on the menu."}
{"text":"Today, my mother and I went to this location for lunch when we got there it was ok at first. We thought our waiter would be cool and attentive, sadly we were mistaken...we ordered two of the 6.99 burgers and BOTTOMLESS fries as well as a rasberry cream soda. The wait for the food was a little long but hey it was actually worth the wait, the burgers and a small handful of fries were delicious; as to why I gave this two stars but our waiter I would give 1 or just none. He was more attentive towards other customers then us never asked if we wanted more fries, forgot our soda like twice. Not to mention that we asked for napkins and got it 15 minutes later...
They just seemed like they were short staff or I don't know, come for great food but expect BAD costumer service and waiting forever for a table."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weekday. A Friday to be more exact. This is our third or fourth visit to this one. Only once did we stop here for lunch and not stay. May have been a game day or spring training day, but the lobby was packed and we didn't want to wait. Otherwise, on our other visits, we've been greeted right away. We always sit in the bar which is open seating. 

We usually order one of the burgers with bottomless fries and my favorite, the Ensenada Platter. The service has always been good. The food fresh and hot.

The only negative here for me is the closeness of tables in the bar. If it's fairly full, you're almost elbow-to-elbow and you feel like you have to manuever sideways to get to your table.

Otherwise, fresh food, good service and a pleasant atmosphere are what it's about!"}
{"text":"Slimmy, greasy, cold burgers. Fries with no taste and horrible server. Only things that was good was the margarita. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I love Red Robin! Great food, chill atmosphere, great for both adults and families. They've been conscientious of allergy issues and have a great veggie burger. Had the amazing Bailey's shake for the first time today and loved it! Tastes more like a Bailey's flavored ice cream milk shake. I've been upgrading their bottomless fries to garlic herb flavor. This is super tasty but ends up being really oily. Service is usually excellent and attentive. Sports on the tv and a separate bar area only for adults."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. We come here often when we want reliable food and service. It can get a bit pricey, that's why I give it 4 stars, but overall it is a great place. The service and wait staff are wonderful and I have never had a problem with my orders."}
{"text":"Service SUCKS...
My burger was super small and when my other burger came out it was super burnt amd THE FOOD SUCKS...
Management SUCKS...
The server wouldn't even listen to what I wanted to order without telling me what her favorite burger was. 

My worst Red Robin experience of my entire Red Robin history, this location SUCKS I enjoy the Chandler location much better and the Chandler location is also more RESPECTFUL. 
PLEASE RETRAIN MANAGEMENT AND STAFF."}
{"text":"Went there today for a bite to eat before driving home 3 1/2 hours. We were instantly greeted and the hostess even engaged in a bit of conversation. We were seated and our server didn't take long to arrive. I'm not sure of his name but he was very efficient and polite! Our food didn't take long to arrive and it was hot and fresh and they even remember to put no tomatoes. The little Ziosks on the table were a bit confusing when I wanted to pay in cash but use my Robins card for points. However the server showed me exactly how to use it. If I'm ever in the Charlotte area again, I will definitely be visiting this location again!"}
{"text":"We typically love Red Robin. Decided to stop in this location since we moved to this side of town, and we all just got done with a hike at Red Rock and wanted a good meal. Came with a group of 7, neither hostess seemed like they  knew how to seat a group that big and it took a long time to just get seated, when all they had to do was push 2 tables together in their EMPTY dining room. Off to a great start already. We all order and wait for what seems like forever, only to receive our orders, with tons of errors. One of our friends burgers was missing a couple things he asked for. We didn't get the poutine that we ordered when we received all our other food. When we informed them, they brought it out with mushrooms,  which we asked to not have on it. I just felt like saying forget it at this point and just get up and walk out. The poutine was absolutely horrible. The \"cheese curds\" were completely dry in the middle. I am a WI girl, so don't try giving me mediocre curds!  The only thing every employee seemed to be good at was asking if we needed more fries every time they passed by, even though we clearly had two full baskets that they brought us before that we didn't touch. No, we don't need more freaking fries! So annoying.  The whole almost 3 hours we where here, dealing with horrible service, the servers and manager were acting like we were being annoying and weren't welcome when they were the ones messing everything up. Sorry, but this was not our fault Red Robin. They offered two free desserts between the 7 of us, which even came out wrong! They then proceeded to take forever to settle the bill. I shouldn't have to sit in a restaurant for that long getting horrible service and being treated like we aren't wanted. We will not be returning to this location, ever. So disappointed."}
{"text":"hi, this place has gone down hill.... the burgers are smaller than before and the prices are up! the a1 peppercorn burger had 2 teeny strips of undercooked bacon :(   I ordered their clam chowder, it was served in a ramekin, watery w one teeny clam :(... so much smaller than before,  the guacamole tasted very artificial defineat ly no avocados, just avocado flavor that's soupy and yucky,  onions were barely cooked, the fries were undercooked, limpy, and cold, when I told our waitress she gave us the dirtiest look, and never brought any back. then
I ordered my burger well down I specifically asked please no pink inside, I cut it in half VERY PINK!!!  she gave attitude about that too. I sent that back, don't eat pink meat !!!!!! my friend ordered chicken wrap, that is also much smaller, with no flavor and icky chopped up teeny chicken, lots of lettuce though ! avoid this place at all costs ! waste of money :("}
{"text":"We've somehow become something like regulars here recently, and I'm so glad.  From our service to our food, we are never disappointed!  Especially our service - everyone has been efficient, kind, and responsive.  The mint brownie milkshake is divine, I love their chili, and the burgers and fries are always tasty.  My husband enjoys the root beer float with his noms, and I love that the kids menu is totally customizable.  Superb!"}
{"text":"The staff here are AWESOME! The floors and tables were very clean, as were the restrooms. The food was good, although one of our burgers came out substantially later then the rest of the food, but our waitress and the manager made up for that. The manager was extremely friendly off the bat (He sat us at our table). We talked for a little while about many different things and he was very kind and fun to talk to. Our waitress was also extremely nice and very good with service. Overall a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I work in the restaurant industry so the next two cents I'm about to offer should not be taken lightly. 

I have a terrible habit of watching and critiquing restaurants as I'm eating, but very rarely will I post about my experience. I come to Red Robin frequently, always hoping my experience will be better than the last. 

The food is always delicious. There's no doubt about that; however, the service is consistently poor to fair in ranking. 

It took close to seven minutes after arriving to be greeted and asked if we'd like drinks. I travel with a 5-year-old so I expect a children's menu of some sort. That never came. It took our server THREE times at our table to even ask if we were ready to order. He would come by and say, \"be right back\" every time. I was ready to go right away because we are creatures of habit and get the same thing every time. I'm not saying he should have known that, and I understand he was busy (although I only saw one other table he was serving), but he should have at least asked. 

The managers were involved and walking around as they should, but you'd think they would make more of an effort with their guests. I didn't see them attempt to talk to tables or check in to see how things were going. There is a very cute, middle-aged manager who works at this location and she ALWAYS checks in on the tables. She's the blonde one if you ever stop in. She's genuine and very sweet. 

There was one server named Aron (I think that's how it was spelled on his tag) who I saw always with a guest, constantly checking in, and getting drinks and food out right away. He wasn't our server, but he looked like he knew a thing or two about good service. 

This isn't a terrible place for lunch, but if you're with a child and you don't look like you'll have a bill over $50, you might not get the greatest service. 

For the record, despite this review, our bill was $11.61 and I am leaving a $20. I hope that proves how much HOPE I have for this place. It has some great potential."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this place but I wonder why I insist to come back. I always ask for a specific table and always tell them I don't like booth because is too tight for my big body. They continuously ignore me and take me to a booth. Today, after been taken to a booth again I reminded her the table requested. She took us there but a family was just given the table. No apologies from the girl, just told me to pick another table."}
{"text":"The food is what I expected since I've eaten at this location several times before.  This time, however, it wasn't the food but other diners who cause the experience to be less than pleasurable.  I was seated next to a booth of 6 people (it appeared to be 3 couples).  From the time I sat down until I left (as quickly as possible I might add) these folks were loud, obnoxious and rude.  It was as though they were sitting on a patio somewhere rather than in a public restaurant.   And they weren't younger folks.  They were probably in the early 40's.  I mentioned it to my server who apologized but did nothing more.  I think the management of the restaurant should have intervened and asked them to quiet down a bit.   I do understand the restaurant would have been in an awkward position but they need to consider the comfort of all of their guest, not just 6 loud people.  I don't object to people having a good time when dining out but not so much so that it affects others around them.  I've been to a Chucky Cheese where it was quieter than Red Robin on this day."}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Today we had lunch here and ordered the chips, salsa and guac as an appetizer, along with a cup of soup each.  (I should have known better than to eat so much before my main meal...)  It was all delicious and our server was awesome.

I ordered some salad wrap and fries, but honestly, I was so full from the appetizers that I barely ate my meal.  I would have taken it to go but alas, our hotel doesn't have a refrigerator. :-(  

Anyway, always a good experience for us when we eat here. :-)"}
{"text":"This is the place I always go to when I'm craving for good burgers, endless fries and drinks with company. I try to usually go for lunch or early dinner when the atmosphere is more relaxed, yet efficient.
My favorite and go-to is usually the Royal Red Robin, but I recently had the Guacamole Bacon, and it was just as good. Seriously like the way they cook the fried egg on the Royal 'cause once you slice into it, the yolk just melts into the rest of the ingredients. As for the Guacamole Bacon, it was just a good spread to the sandwich and not as messy XD
As usual, I liked their fries. My sister and I kinda had less for the first serving of fries, so we ended up asking for a second plate. She also had the Garlic Aoili fries, which she enjoys, but they kinda over-seasoned it this time. Still good though. Don't forget to ask for extra napkins 'cause eating the burgers could get messy.  
As far as drinks go, I like their Fireball Peach Smash (especially in the spring and summer). This time we had both gotten Not Your Father's Root Beer. I just thought it was cool 'cause it's a new menu item. 
I had forgotten our server's name, but she was pretty good. She constantly checked up on us during our meal, and helped me out when it came to paying for the bill on their new table devices. The hostess that seated my sister and I even checked up on us when our server was busy in the beginning."}
{"text":"The last few times we have been there, the service is just not up to par. I ordered the Avo-Cobb-O salad...cobb salad with avocado. it comes out with no avocado on it. It's literally in the name of the salad. I couldn't care less about bottomless fries, just get my order correct. it's a salad for goodness sake. it doesn't seem all that difficult. I would rather go somewhere else...pay a little more for better quality food and better service. just because you call the burgers \"gourmet\" doesn't mean they are good. We won't be going back there. I've given them 3 chances...2 too many in my book."}
{"text":"I tried to send feedback directly to Red Robin, however their web-page doesn't accept feedback. Bottom line, there was a hair in my burger.  I try to be rational and understand that these things happen.  But this was a gross one.  I was eating with others and didn't want to gross them out, so I tried to pull the hair out without issue, however it was very long, dark, and stuck throughout my sandwich.  It was in the cheese, which had since dried up making it immobile, and I had to remove all the condiments to get to the full length.  At that point I was beyond grossed out and threw away my order.  I spent $26 on lunch for myself and a co-worker and didn't get to eat it."}
{"text":"We enjoyed their burgers a great deal.  We particularly enjoyed the special \"Octoberfest\" burger.  The service was quick, polite and the food was good.  I'd recommend the Red Robin."}
{"text":"Place was really good 1st few years in business but last 3 attempts to eat a medium burger with fries resulted in me eating a bite of the charcoal patty.
The burger size has been reduced as well.
Fries are good though.
Not one to return food so paid bill my last 3 visits and left the shit burger and this time told waitress to show the cook.
She said we have new cooks training to justify the meal.
They told me that a month ago when the same occurrence happened.  How hard is it to cook per the request... 
I'm done."}
{"text":"went yesterday afternoon (5/7/2014) to this location. my fiance took me here because i wanted to try something new and this literally was my VERY first time EVER going to a Red Robins and probably my last because the service I received was just that horrible. 
the restaurant was pretty slow so we got there and waited to be seated. which took much longer than usual considering how dead it was at this time of day. the server (i believe his name was Tye) did not even greet us, instead just escorted us to our table with a very unfriendly and unapproachable attitude. when he did take our orders, he just seemed like he hated his job; his tone was very monotonous, straight forward and very rushed with no eye contact whatsoever as if he was talking to the wall next to our booth. as much as we thought he hated his job, the crazy thing was when he want in the back towards the kitchen with the other employees, he was cracking jokes and having what looked like  a really good time with his co-workers, but as soon as he stepped back into server mode, he seemed miserable.
I will say the food was pretty good, hence the one star, but we did rush to eat and regrettably had no dessert because we just wanted to leave; it was that unpleasant, and we honestly took it very personal.
this was my VERY FIRST review, and I never do this, but the service there to me was that unpleasant to break that chain!"}
{"text":"Had not been to Red Robin in a while so decided to give it a try. The staff was really nice, but 5 bucks for a lemonade is rough.  The glass they serve it in i guess is supposed to be fun but it was kind of awkward.

The sandwich I ordered came prepared wrong. I got a sorry and we could make you another from the server. Maybe half off the lemonade would have been nice? Was in a rush so that was not an option.  The sandwich itself the Chicken Bruschetta was a little rubbery and the produce on it was terrible making the sandwich pretty un-enjoyable.  I would have given a two since the food came out wrong and was not too terrific,  but the staff was very nice about everything.

I'll wait a few years and try it again"}
{"text":"At what point did restaurant joints remove your choice on how the meat is prepared?  If you spend $13 for a burger, shouldn't you have the option of rare, med fare, med, med well, and/or well? Not at red robin anymore, you get the option of pink or no pink which roughly translated means hockey puck or used tampon.  Apparently the management at RR have no faith in their cooks to do their jobs and run your meat through an oven on a conveyor belt. So much for quality.  

This was easy, simple and satisfying place to bring the family.  Good thing I have other burger options that are better and cheaper"}
{"text":"I go there all the time and am addicted to their wings.

The good:
- They have the best burgers bar none.
-  Their appetizers are really good. I think they have the best wings in the world and you can have a lot of fun with their onion rings and other stuff.
- Endless fries
- It usually is pretty fast. 
- They usually make it up to you if they screw up.

The bad:
- Due to their location they usually attract families with kids screaming at the top of their lungs. The parents all find the screaming to be \"cute\" of course and won't dare stop their precious little angels from ruining your dinner. Stay far away from any of the tables that seat 6 people or more.
- They used to have problems with running out of french fries and taking forever to make burgers, even though burgers were the only things they made. They have been much better lately though.
- No sliders. Why? Who knows.
- If you order the short stack of onion rings, you get the smaller end. So, you get maybe 2-3 full size onion rings instead of the 6 you should be getting.
- Their television's are not well placed. They either require neck pain to watch or aren't possible to watch at all."}
{"text":"I love me a Whiskey River BBQ Burger OR a Banzai Burger!  I also like the BBQ Chicken Wrap if you want to eat light.  

This place is all about time of day.  Go in the afternoon during the week for lunch.  Usually the service is good between open and dinner and the food is really made with care from not being rushed.  It's not bad at night but with anyplace, you're taking your chances with so many people.

A burger is $10 but, unlimited fries and drink water (you're about to eat a lot of calories) and two people can have a nice lunch for about $30 with a decent tip.  

If Burgatory has too long of a wait, go here before your movie.  Thank me later.

YUMMM!"}
{"text":"You would think that with all restaurants in Surprise they would pay more attention to you
Me and my husband walked out after being ignored 
This is the second time this has happened to us in the last month
We will go back to the one by Arrowhead mall
Mike is a great server"}
{"text":"This has become a go to spot for a quick burger or salad.

Most of the time we are there during off hours so service has never been an issue. In fact, most times we sit at the bar. 

I have had many different burgers. And I also enjoy the salads. The endless fries are good (and bad thing!) 

I have read several reviews in which service was bad or slow. I have not experienced this. But again, most times going during off hours. 

I do also enjoy the shakes.

I nice change to the fast food for a quick burger, sandwich or salad."}
{"text":"Stopped during the week for lunch. This was actually our second try. Stopped the week before on a Friday and the wait was too long for us to stay. This time we were seated within a few minutes.

We ordered a burger with coleslaw and the Ensenada Chicken. I had been looking forward to trying the Ensenada Chicken after seeing it on their website. It didn't disappoint! Everything came out hot and fresh. The chicken was tender, and the sauce flavorful!



Our server was very nice. Stopped back several times to see how everything was and for drink refills."}
{"text":"Went to RR this evening for dinner. What a disappointment. Being playoff season, we sat the bar and ordered a beer. We were told they ran out of CO2. C'mon man! Right on their marquee it says , \"Burgers and Brews\". My husband ordered a grilled chicken salad. His salad was paltry bagged lettuce with a sub-par grill chicken breast and not much else. 
I ordered a bread-less well-done burger that was pink and cold. Yuck! Our waiter offered to have another made but my husband was almost finished with his meal, so I declined. 
The manager came over and let us know that he was removing my meal from the bill. Well, no kidding. After all, why would I pay for something I didn't get? The beer taps should have been covered as inoperable and my husband's meal should have been reduced or comped. The only positive was you can pay your bill using an iPad system so you can get the heck out of there.   Boo Red Robin, major fail!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here with some friends.  I ordered the turkey croissant sandwich but we shared some onion rings and spinach artichoke dip.  Everything was delicious and the servers were very friendly and prompt.  We had a three year old in our party and she is a very picky eater, especially when it comes to her favorite mac and cheese.  She was very happy with what she got.  The french fries, which is what I have always heard is the best part of this place, were very tasty and I can see why people enjoy them.  I would go there again, for a chain restaurant it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Dornisha had way too many tables and was very slow. Very disappointed because we come here very often. Had to get the hostess to get us salt for our margaritas and our fries were burnt and not fresh at all. Needless to say we will not be returning to this place again! Not worth your money ppl. Pick a different location! Can't believe it."}
{"text":"Refused to take carryout before opening. Every restaurant everywhere does this. The service is very slow at this location. Go to washington location instead"}
{"text":"ate there 3/11/15 at around 8:30pm

Food was good & portions are big for me which is okay, since I can take the extra home if i wanted to. The manager Brian checked on us from time to time & was friendly. Our waiter was busy spacing off as she spoke to us, & she forgot to give me my request of extra lemons.

It's not a bad place at all, we were seated quickly & our food came out just as quick. The only thing i didn't like was their shrimp from their seafood scatter."}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised.  We have not been into a Red Robin in many years but glad to see some of the changes to the menu (yet keeping the old favorites, Banzai Burger and Royal Red Robin).  Great additional options and having 2 children, 2 and 5, was great to see several options to keep them entertained until our food arrived (crayons, chalk and wipe boards, table video games (small fee))  The food was great and the service was on point.  Before I took my last drink she had another refill in front of me.  Definitely will go back and very family friendly."}
{"text":"Love the food, just sad to look at my itemized receipt after the visit and see that I was charged $1.99 entertainment fee. I know this relates to the device on the table but t as we did not use it why should we pay for it. 
Note to any prospective customers, keep an eye out for this. Truly distasteful to realize you've been scammed by such a seemingly reputable place, I guess all the $1.99s add up to more than what their customers' trust is worth."}
{"text":"Red Robin manages to get two stars because of the service, but otherwise I was really disappointed in the quality of their food recently.
I had the chicken and waffles special since I was not in a huge mood for a burger and I wanted to try something new.  The sauce they use does not really match with what I would have wanted in a chicken/waffles dish/sandwich.  It was a runny spicy kind of sauce, I would have thought it would be a creamy or ranch like sauce.  It wasn't.  Then came the larger disappointment, the waffle was cold, dense, and not appealing at all.
I came in later in the evening after working all day, so I really wanted to sit at the bar, but the bar and the seats were messy.  The entire bar area seemed to not to be clean.
Nothing to really brag about that $12.99 sandwich other than a $5 sandwich from other fast food joints."}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant that makes you wait over 10 minutes to be seated and then you see over half the tables are empty! When I ask why I had to wait, the hostess says they were giving the servers breaks.... \"Sorry\"

I understand breaks, but not all at once! Poor management."}
{"text":"Perkins with only burgers.  I got what I expected.  Good place to bring a kid."}
{"text":"I've been to the RR at the Galleria Mall and it was great, so I was excited that one opened up at Downtown Summerlin. I hate to write a bad review, but the only thing good about our trip to this Red Robin was the service. The \"onion dip and chips\" appetizer was awful. The dip was soupy and the chips were soggy...I'm guessing there was a problem with the fryer because the fries were soft and soggy and the onion straws in my chicken burger were slithery and not crispy at all. The server did her best to make it up to us, and even brought the cronuts to us free as a desert...but they were uncooked in the middle too. I heard several other people send back fried things because they weren't cooked. The burger itself was under seasoned and quite bland. Red Robin better rethink the \"gourmet burgers\" sign on the building. With so many awesome little places in town to find actual \"gourmet\" burgers, I doubt we'll be back to Red Robin any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of times since my last review, and just a few weeks ago I ate here with my sister and brother-in-law, as they both enjoy this chain. I don't go here if it's just me, but I don't mind meeting others here since it's convenient and it's not that bad.

My last time was probably the most enjoyable. Granted, it might have been because I was there with my sister and her husband, but I felt like the food was better, too. I don't think I'll ever like this location as much as the one in Greensboro; when I'd eat there, I remember thinking the original gourmet burger was the bomb, whereas here it's just really good.

I wanted to revise my original review, though, because I feel like this is closer to four stars now. Maybe not a solid four stars. But close. :-)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at this particular Red Robin several times and never once had a bad experience.  Friendly service, good food and decent prices.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Same old same old. The biggest problem was the service. The last 2 times we visited this restaurant it has been horrible service. I do not plan on coming back anytime soon. 1.5 stars"}
{"text":"Oh wait..I have to add to my review of Red Robin below..that after all that the waitress had the nerve to give me a customer survey card with my bill!!! Shows how dumb she was. If I were her, I would have done everything possible to get me out of there without knowing that survey existed....
That was one survey I was very happy to answer. hahah. Dumb dumb girl."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this location. My wife and I ordered our food to go. While we waited on our meals we sat at the bar. The bartender was knowledgable and even provided us with a beer combination we never heard of. Overall the food and service was good. The bar area is a little to tight for me.  We arrived in the evening so I would imagine during  happy hour the place gets packed. Also the dinning room area appeared packed so prepare for a wait. I would return for take out or to eat at the bar."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just because we've had such lacklustre dining experiences since arriving in Madison, but my husband and I both truly enjoyed our meal here tonight! 

It was super busy, but it's Friday, and we still only had to wait about five minutes for our table. The hostess and server were both really friendly. The server was busy, but as we sat down, she told us she'd be with us as soon as she could--and she was with us quickly, despite how busy her section was! She also kept up with refills and was very friendly. We also saw all the many tables get cleared very quickly and neatly. The kitchen staff who brought out our food was also friendly, and a manager stopped by to check on everything.

So just on service alone, I'd give these guys four stars, since it was really good, especially considering how busy it was.

But then there was the food. Now, I've not been to a Red Robin before, but I figured it was something like an Applebee's or similar. Going in to the restaurant, that's what I expected, and was surprised to see the prices were a -bit- more. However, when we got our food, it was significantly better.

The food was delicious, hot, and our requests to leave off various things were followed perfectly. We both just had burgers, but we saw other things we'd love to come back and try.

For a chain restaurant, I wasn't expecting much, and this place was outstanding. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We were sat at a dirty table to start.

Under the table was filled with someone's spilled drink and it was covered with paper towels and placed with a wet floor sign on top. And that's where she sat us. Seriously moved the wet floor sign an inch and sat us at the dirty wet table.

There's two other tables open but I'm like whatever don't let it get to you. Someone started to clean it maybe they'd be back. Nope wrong. Had to flag down the hostess again as she was sitting a different set of guest at a clean table.

By now four servers has passed us but none have greeted us. Someone comes to clean the mess and is even surprised we were sat there and apologies.
Then leaves

Still haven't been greeted.
Waiting 
Waiting 

Oh look the people sat after us are being greeted and getting drinks

Yeah we left and we are now at the Applebee's down the way. Not what we wanted but we walked in and were sat at a clean table and were greeted within one minute.

Didn't think that was much to ask for from a restaurant.

At least say hey be right with you. Damn"}
{"text":"I love Red Robin but the new tavern burgers are crap. I would expect better from Red Robin even for a cheaper option. But they still have really good full price burgers. Very family orientated and the club is great!"}
{"text":"This was the first time eating at Red Robin in 5 years. We went here for lunch because my boyfriend had a birthday coupon. We sat at a flat top in the bar and immediately greeted by a server/bartender, Cathy or maybe it's Kathy. She took our drink orders and brought them no less then 5 minutes later with a card explaining their loyalty program. She briefly explained it and took our food orders.

Our food came in less than 10 minutes, and she came to check and see if it was to our liking. My boyfriend used up all the ketchup so I just swiped some from an empty table next to us. She saw it happen and apologized and made sure we had a sufficient amount of ketchup. She grabbed the empty bottle from the other table and replaced it. She checked on us one more time during our meal. 

We were in and out in 45 min.

I'm giving this place 3 stars on the food because it wasn't the best thing I ever had (All American Patty Melt and Regular Fries), but it wasn't the worst.

The service gets 5 stars. Cathy/Kathy was awesome she gave us awesome service. She gave us the perfect amount of attention and was as nice as could be.

During our lunch, a table next to us complained about the service and the food to the manager. As I eavesdropped, they ordered new food as well as 2 more burgers to go. Strange. (They had a different server)."}
{"text":"We did even get our name on the waitlist, we were there for about 10min with a full lobby and with guest coming out saying \"good luck\" doesn't give you high hopes. This was the worst service I have seen and we didn't even get sit down. Will not be going back to this red Robin again. We will be going to surrounding Red Robin's with better service! If you go here good luck!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, came out pretty fast. Was crowded for a Tuesday night, still seated in about 10-15 minutes. Server worked hard to make sure we were taken care of. He must have wanted the extra few bucks in tip, which I gave because he definitely earned. I'll be back mostly because of the service."}
{"text":"Great place. Mentioned to the waitress (Kristy) about something wrong, didn't even complain, and she had the manager (Ron) take care of it."}
{"text":"I am basing this review on takeout. The website was very easy to use. We were able to pick up our food within 15 minutes on a Friday night. My husband went to pick it up and called to have it brought it right out to the car. The burgers were hot and yummy and the onion rings were good. I would highly recommend take out!"}
{"text":"First visit got served cold queso. Requested another and it was delivered by overbearing, aggressive manager. Felt attacked. Requested additional chips for remaining dip which were never delivered. So glad we ordered food when we did as waitress/bartender hasn't been back as it's gotten busy. Who knows about a second chance, questionable."}
{"text":"This was my first time back to red robin in about 8 yrs. Stopped in for lunch with 3 of my coworkers, i was kind of skeptical with the mixed reviews.  Appon arriving we were nice ly greated and sat right away.  Are server was over in about 5 min from being sat, we all knew what we wanted when she came over so we ordered are food at the same time as the drinks and 1 shake.  She put an order of fries in for each of us and they were out in about 10 min and the second round which we order when they brought the first round was about 4 min behind, which was great fry app before are mains arrived. Oh the campfire sauce is on point and a nice no charge add on to the fries.  There was a mistake on the milkshake which was corrected before we noticed and we got to drink that one too, so bouns shake.  I ordered the firey ghost pepper burger which was delicious and nice and spicy not for the non heat folks.  Everyones burgers were cooked as ordered and all the plates were clean at the end of the meal.  Not to mention we were in and out in 45min which was perfect for our hr lunch. We will definitely be back for lunch again and will recommend to others at work."}
{"text":"So we decided to give this place another shot (and after speaking with Katie who I assume is the owner or GM). We came here for lunch, brought the kiddos. This time the server we had, her name is Ariel. Ariel was nothing but smiles and treated us with just the best possible service possible. My kids we all smiles when she came and checked in on us. The food this time around was definitely a 180 from the last time. The fries were done, apps and main course time in between was perfect and the only thing that was a miss, was they forgot my tartar sauce with my fish (but i honestly think it was because i asked for a side of ranch for my fries, no biggie). Ariel brought the missing tartar over in a hurry. One thing i dont like about here but this could me being old school, the at table kiosk thing. I think its.a great idea for paying the bill, but i think it takes away from the interaction between the waitress and customer. Thats just my opinion on that. Overall, Ariel did an amazing job taking care of us, checking in and making sure our visit here was a good one. She definitely nailed it on the head. As for the food, definitely a better experience and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food here is good but the service is a different story. I ordered carry out and they completely forgot to give me one of my meals but it was still on the receipt. The staff is rude and the place is freezing. Also, the milkshakes suck."}
{"text":"I love Red Robin! They have an awesome selection of burgers & drinks. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. Most places now have one vegetarian alternative, Red Robin has two alternatives and they can \"convert\" any burger to vegetarian."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to go in because she was craving a burger. We were quickly seated and our waitress was prompt. One way I always judge a server is by how often they check how full your glass is. We never had an empty glass. We ordered the pickle nickels which probably would have been better if they didn't taste like they were fried in old grease. My mom ordered the Brie burger and raved about it. I ordered the BLTA and the ingredients were very fresh.  This is a place we'll definitely return to in the future."}
{"text":"Visited 11/23/12...

This is always a great place for a hamburger.  Endless steak fries.  And great shakes.  

I have always had a good burger. Better than fast food with bar and ability to have a beer or other beverage if you desier. 

Good service.  Quick food. 

Always a reliable choice for a quick burger."}
{"text":"Horrible! Went in for a \"quick\" dinner since husband had a meeting at 730 to be at. Got sat and ordered by 6:19. Waited. Waited. Finally asked at 7 if our food will be coming soon and explained if its going to be much longer we will need it to go. Waitress said it should be out soon and she will go check. She then proceeded to clean the other tables and ask the table behind us if they needed anything. Once our food did arrive it was, of course, disappointing. Our son's grilled cheese was not even warm, my soup had the \"it's been sitting\" film over it and came w/o the bread. We didn't have time to get things fixed but when we mentioned it to the waitress she did offer to nuke his sandwich... Why do they have a microwave?? While scarfing our food down we ask for the check and it arrives wrong. Takes going to \"the manager\" to get it fixed which, of course, takes forever! We have been here only when good deals have been offered and literally the last 3 times have been horrible! Not even worth it anymore. 3 strikes, done."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with this place. Went last night for a burger and I love CHRISTMAS ale this time of year, if the bar tender is a true Clevelander. I had to send it back for them to rim the glass, then it came out with cinnamon sugar around the rim no sugar in the beer no cinnamon in the beer. Just a bad bartender. We ordered simple burgers that was mediocre at best. So for $40 we got two mediocre burgers, Stouffer's macaroni and cheese some french fries. Sweet tea and a beer.
It was my husband and I so I guess it was okay to put us at one of those little 1/2 tables where you fee isl you have no room and definitely not meant for comfort.
I have one nice thing to say is that the waitress was pleasant."}
{"text":"The recent upgrades they made to the place look great! I've never had a complaint in all the years I have gone to this location. My food is always great, my servers have always been cheerful & very attentive & it's always clean. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"I had a fried chicken salad with ranch. The salad is big enough for two people to share. My grandson had grill cheese and my husband a burger. Good all American hamburger place. Even has eating outside
Service is wonderful"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain. Yes, the service is OFTEN lackluster. Yes, it's a small step above fast food.

But I'll be damned I gotta have some Clucks N Fries every now and then! The big fat fries with house seasoning salt work so perfectly to soak up buffalo and ranch sauces. It's a splurge meal that I deserve every once in a while. They keep trying to put different lipstick on this pig. Bar items, Menu changes, Specials, etc... but we all see right through it. It's still the same Red Robin and that's all I want it to be. 

If you're really hedonistic you can become Red Robin Royalty which means you're a glutton beyond belief and they will reward you for it. You can even carry a round a plastic card to prove it."}
{"text":"We love Red Robin, particularly at this location since it opened.  Now, not so much.  The food has always been great, no complaints there.  Service, though, is definitely on the downside.  While waiting for my hubby to join me, I ordered a drink that was immediately brought to me.  So far, so good.  When he didn't arrive momentarily, I decided to order an appetizer via the new tabletop monitor.  Our waitress passed by me (and the blinking monitor) more than once.  Never did get a chance to order one.  When I saw my husband entering the restaurant, I ordered a drink for him.  We then waited 20 minutes for our waitress to finally take our order.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited for our food.  Finally it arrived.  We were never asked if we needed anything or if we wanted more food.  I asked for a glass of water. Twice.  Never got it.  After being there for 1-1/2 hours, we asked for the check.  I left my comments on the monitor when I paid the bill but never heard back from Red Robin, so I decided to leave my comments on Yelp.  Hopefully things improve.  If not, then we're back to eating at the Mills."}
{"text":"Ok, so I said I would never be back, but the fries and 6.99 burger were calling my name. And who can deny those fries? Service was great and the place was packed. Ordered the siracha tavern double burger and child got the clucks and fries. Red Robin yummmmmm! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Well.....this will be my last visit to Red Robin. My husband and I wanted to take our daughter out for a nice lunch before school starts. Unfortunately we picked the wrong place. We were seated immediately and placed our order. 1/2 an hour later our food came out  ice cold. They did remake 2 out of the 3 meals. Totally disappointed with the whole meal. There are to many options in this area, and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great place and bottomless fries! Yummy usually excellent service as well!  I'd like to eat there daily Thanks"}
{"text":"I typically like Red Robin. I've only been to this location one time. This time was a little different. The Experience started off really well and then I received my salad and the lettuce was a little wilted, the burger was good my son's food was good. I ordered milkshakes to go one of them was the mint Brownie and the other was the cookie Shake. So, your first thought when you order both of those and is that brownie pieces will be in there and cookie pieces. The first time I receive my shake I received two cups filled a quarter or less than a quarter of the way with green water. I asked her what it was and she told me it was my milkshakes. I let her know that I did not order to quarter cups of shakes so she went to fix it and brought me a shake back told me to have a good day and walked away. But, the milkshake was extremely watery it was the texture of soda and they were clumps of melted ice cream throughout and at the bottom of the cup were little tiny black pellets that I'm assuming were brownie pieces! LOL Red Robin should definitely stick with their burgers and bottomless fries. I will stick with cookout for my shakes from now on. Overall the experience was decent."}
{"text":"Last Tuesday, we went into Red Robin to enjoy my birthday burger.  If you sign up for their rewards program you receive a free burger on the month that is your birthday.  We waited for the hostess to sit us down.  They sat the ladies in front of us in the main dining area.  We were sat in a table in the bar area.  The bartender came and took our drink and food order.  Our drinks came and we finished them and then our re fills came.  Still no food!  At this time there were no other people in the area and the ladies who were sat before us were already finished with their meal.  Our food came out about 40 minutes later.  The burgers were lukewarm and fries were cold like they were just sitting there waiting for someone to bring out.  The manager then came to check on us and ask if we needed anything.  

When our check came and gave them my phone number for my birthday burger.  We were told that we could use this because of the gourmet burger we ordered. We got one free burger because it was my 10th burger.  (I come to Red Robin a lot).  I am definitely not coming back in the next couple days again to receive the birthday burger.  Bartender tried to explain the confusion, still did not make sense.  Manager came back and tried to explain again.  At that point we just wanted to pay and leave.  Clearly the bartender is banging the manager because he went in the save a couple times.  Do not come to this location for the excellent service, you will not receive it."}
{"text":"Order everything well done. Today's beef selection almost killed my whole family. Good burger until it hits the small intestines."}
{"text":"Went here on a very busy Saturday night, got seated relatively quickly.  Waitress was a little rude, but my biggest complaint is the floors are very slippery!!  I walk with a cane and thought maybe it was just me until another guest also complained...the bathroom is way in the left corner and it was safety hazard to get to!  They should consider putting down rugs."}
{"text":"My husband loves burgers and we wanted to go somewhere new close to home, figuring we would enjoy burgers from a national burger chain. Wrong. We paid $32 for a meal that tasted like it was made at McDonald's. The burgers were small, tasteless, and unappetizing. The fries probably came out of a bag in the freezer. We were extremely disappointed. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Red Robin. Good food seems the same no matter what restaurant you go to. Like the burgers but they have fantastic onion rings. Only Red Robin I've been to that wasn't good was in Lake Havasu City. Bad food, like they didn't wash the salad and veggies. All others have been great."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try one of these places. Came here on a day away from work. 

Pretty cool designed interior. 

It was rather crowded, which I don't blame because the food is great, and the service is even better.

I experienced the \"Whiskey BBQ Burger\" and the \"Root Bear Float\" to go with. 

This place is greater than your standard chained burger place. 

So many burgers to choose from, it's definitely worth the try more than once."}
{"text":"Red Robins is AMAZING! I don't recommend getting an appetizer because your actual meal will really full you up. Loved the Cupcake shake. Their burgers and wraps are also so yummy! Try!"}
{"text":"Order sat on counter 5 minutes before it was brought to the table. I complained to manager and his response  was served within 20 minutes of the order being placed and that was an acceptable time. Needless to say the order was soggy from setting under the warming lights so long."}
{"text":"Just went in tonight cause I was craving cheese and meat and burgers. My friend Cassey H. and I got a table quickly, the server Jess was super friendly and kept us updated on how things were going. (The ice cream machine was being grouchy). We got our food and it was fantastic as usual. Our drinks stayed full and Jess was so helpful. I really love Red Robin and this location is my go-to for close to home comfort food."}
{"text":"i only go to Red Robin once a year  - when i get my yearly free birthday burger coupon. the reason is simple, there's no reason to. the bottomless fries are nice, but i've never been a big fan of their burgers, \"gourmet\" though they might be. they aren't terrible, for sure, but i can get better, cheaper burgers elsewhere.
the service we've had has always been good, so i have no complaints about that.  
i don't get the redesign. gone is the family friendly sort of atmosphere they used to have. in it's place is a more slick and polished look and feel that will likely keep people from bringing their kids. i hope i'm wrong about that, but it felt like that's what they were aiming for. to be honest though, the new seats did look nice and comfortable, though we chose to eat outside."}
{"text":"They have really reworked the menu since the last time I was here. It's definitely not a paleo place to eat, but for a chain restaurant serving up burgers that's to be expected so I won't hold it against them too much. A lot of the menu items are quite delicious, however unhealthy.

I got the \"Red Robin's Finest Smoke and Pepper\" burger. My only real problem with this was that the burger patty I had was super dry, and a bit grainy. I feel like it was really, really low in fat, like maybe a 5% patty. Fat is flavor and moisture, and the patty was lacking both, especially moisture. The burger flavor that was there, though, was pretty good, and the sauce that came with it on the side was also good. They claim it has \"extra sharp cheddar\" and I think that's definitely wrong. Maybe medium cheddar, maybe, but still good. 

The real star of the show the last couple times I've come have been the appetizers. Yukon chips and onion dip and tavern fries, and the bottomless normal fries. The Yukon chips and onion dip are delicious, and that dip is good for normal fries as well. Really delicious. If you're familiar with In-n-Out burgers and their \"secret\" off-menu Animal Fries option, you know what the Tavern Fries taste like, but with one major addition: bacon. They're like Animal Fries plus bacon, and they are absolutely awesome.

Hopefully next time I come here the burger patty will be improved. It was cooked perfectly so it definitely wasn't dry for being over-done. I ordered it medium and got exactly what I wanted in that aspect but just no moisture and short on flavor."}
{"text":"Poor service, not servers fault store needs more wait staff for the guests. Food is always good. Ended up wet from the misters and had to move due to my table was soaked and me as we'll."}
{"text":"This is literally the best restaurant in the world. Make sure you ask for fries before your burger gets there. All the burgers are amazing and the chicken sandwiches are amazing too."}
{"text":"First time at this Red Robin, but have visited numerous Red Robins throughout the country so I have a source for comparison. First the place was 2/3 empty, my wife and I were offered the bar, or a table. We could see at least 10 empty booths from where we stood. When we asked for a booth, the host went through a song and dance about finding a booth that had been cleared, surprise...... she found one within 15 seconds. 

Waitress comes to the table, dumps cutlery and napkins in pile, doesn't bother to place in front of my wife and myself, no coasters. Asks if we want to order drinks while we are looking at the menu, I asked what beers are on tap. We are directed to a blackboard in a far corner of the restaurant that the waitress can't even read, she then decides she will have the check and get back to us. I understand on tap beers change, but a cheatsheet in your pocket at the start of shift takes a minute. It is 7pm on a Sunday, how many times has she been asked this question today?

My wife orders a Guacamole Bacon burger, she's asked a question I have never heard in a restaurant before \"pink or no pink\"? Translation, our cooks have no training and have never cooked a hamburger before, or the waitress thinks we have the minds of a six year old. Then my wife is asked if she wants fries, garlic fries, various other fries, or onion rings. No mention of the cost of the upsale options. I will say this, I will order whatever I want regardless of price, however I can see this practice adding $10-15 surprise to a large partys bill, it's wrong. I order a Royal Red Robin with onion rings.

We get our drinks, still no coasters. Food comes, burgers are OK, but we've had better at Burger King to tell the truth. I really object to shredded bagged lettuce on a $13 burger, someone is really cutting corners. My wifes garlic fries are cold, greasy, under cooked, but unlimited. My onion rings were cooked in old, dirty grease and were disgusting. 

There is absolutely no excuse for any restaurant cooking in old, dirty grease, most especially a national chain that is supposed to have written standards. If you don't know how to clean your fryers, or lack the proper equipment to clean your grease....THROW IT OUT!

When it comes time for the bill, we're directed to the DIY electronic checkout device on the table, which will also conveniently calculate the tip incorrectly for you. The tip should be based on the cost before taxes, NOT including taxes. I just tip on the total including taxes, but trying to slide a higher tip in under the radar is not a convenience.

I don't complain in restaurants, ask for comps, or make a scene, I just never come back. I wonder how many other patrons of this Red Robin have felt the same way?"}
{"text":"If you're wanting terrible service you've come to the right place... To start, they wouldn't sit us in the bar area because my fiancé was not 21, and then made us wait 30 minutes for a regular table. Once we ordered our waiter disappeared leaving us without drinks and we never got our \"bottomless fries\" until we had finished our whole meal. It was a nightmare and we won't be back to this RR."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service.  i should have known it was going to be bad when we stood at the hostess stand and watched the alleged hostess eat her lunch in a booth.  i cleared my throat and that is what it took to get her attention to look up and notice us after approximately 2 min of standing there.   She wasnt even watching the door (clearly she didn't care).  it was 3pm on a Tuesday.  The place was a ghost town and our blonde haired server was nowhere to be found BEFORE we ordered and after we ordered.  We waited 25 minutes for our food.  I watched the kitchen staff goof off from our booth seats.   When our food arrived it was BEYOND hot. I mean scorching hot.  I have never tasted food that temperature in my life.  When we left I saw the same hostess in the kitchen, goofing off with the kitchen staff.  And the table next to us was trying to find our server.  The best thing to happen to that Red Robin was the installation of kiosks at the table.  You can pay your check right at the table instead of needing to put up a flare to get your server's attention.  No excuses for any of what we experienced today."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have had at any Red Robin's.  We went there on a fairly slow afternoon.  It took two hours to be served two burgers and a salad.  Our server sat about ten feet away from us, talking to a buddy that he apparently lifts weights with.  Used the call server button on the very annoying terminals on the table.  After another wait of over ten (more like 15) minutes, another server from another station came by an asked about the light.  Our food arrived cold.  We will not be back, and we will tell our friends about this terrible experience."}
{"text":"For the enormous corporate burger chain, RRGB it ranks up there as one of the finest.  I have found memories of the Royal Red Robin Burger w/ bottomless fries  and tater sauce while living in Richland, WA back in the 90's.

At this location I might not be able to recreate the 90's but the quality and the bottomless fries remain the same.  No longer is their any tarter sauce but a cornucopia of sauces.  One my most recent visit, I indulged in a garlic dipping sauce-MY NEW FAVORITE.

This location can get busy at times but is well worth the wait.  I have found the servers to be on point.  My drink is never empty for long, my fries always keep coming and it is never with any attitude.

Clean, affordable, and delicious...I look forward to many a return when the delicious burger with a bacon, and fried egg on top calls my name."}
{"text":"I had the fish fry last sat November 21, 2014 and got food poisoning. I was there at 830 pm and felt sick about 15 mins after leaving.  Throwing up fish, living by the toilet and not getting paid for 2 days work is what i suffered.  I was sick for 3 days and needless to say  I will never eat there again!!!!"}
{"text":"All waitstaff please pay attention...

Do not take the glasses from our table to refill them, disappear for five minutes, and return with a tray of drink refills for other tables all mixed together with ours.

I got my refilled drink back with a chewed straw and I didn't chew it. Our waitress got very upset when I informed her that our refilled glasses did not belong to us and she took them away again to refill them or get us new ones. Who knows?

Then she was so upset that I questioned her, she wouldn't even return to our table with the check and made another server do it.

NEVER WILL WE RETURN TO THIS LOCATION.

Rocio, you only got a tip because my teenage daughter was upset that I wasn't going to tip you even with the poor service and bad attitude. I DO NOT WANT TO DRINK OUT OF SOMEONES GLASS OR USE SOMEONES CHEWED UP STRAW. Bring me a new drink or a pitcher to refill our iced teas.

Also, that french dip is WAY TOO salty. I've never had anything so salty."}
{"text":"Best burgers. Unlimited fries are the best. Gift card program is a must."}
{"text":"Campfire sauce is great with the fries. Monster style also great. Wrap Burger in lettuce to save calories."}
{"text":"I had their original burger (figured I'd go with what put them on the map!). The patty seemed on the thin side and didn't fill the bun. It was tasty but nothing spectacular. Cost around $10 with their bottomless fries. My dining companion  had one of their upscale offerings with blue cheese and portobellos. It had two smallish pieces of mushroom on it and the patty itself didn't look to be a half pound as advertised. And it was over $16 with the $2 surcharge for sweet potato fries?!? 

I'd go again as I always feel like you shouldn't judge a place on a single experience but on the other hand I won't go unless someone else really wants to try them."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at this Red Robin. I usually go with friends or a date and get fries when we place our drink order. The food is always hot and correctly prepared. The tables can be a little dirty and the service a bit slower than I'd like but overall it's a great place to get a veggie mushroom swiss burger."}
{"text":"First time I've ever eaten at a Red Robin. The server was terrible, did a lousy job explaining the menu and how it works with the endless fries and how you get points. When asked which burger he suggested, his comment was one with meat. I was hungry and looking to have a good meal with good service, after all they're not the cheapest burgers. I was not in the mood for a cocky, rude server who apparently was having a bad day.  The reason I gave it 3 stars was because the food was actually good. The main reason was the following week I go bed myself in the same place and looking for a bite to eat, figured everyone deserves a second chance and so I went in again. I have to say, the server, an older women whose name I can't remember, was wonderful, she went out of her way to explain the food, points, best burger choices, in her opinion and really made me glad that I chose to give it a second shot. The good old fashioned cheese burger and the Whiskey burger are very good. The fries are really good, my favorite at any burger place. So aside from the staff that sometimes is good and sometimes not, the food is great."}
{"text":"Walked in at lunchtime to an empty lobby. Waited several minutes to be greeted, but saw several employees standing around and visiting. The lobby was not welcoming and looked a little disorderly. 

Corinne was our waitress, and we loved her! She made great suggestions and we really enjoyed her service. Food was amazing, and prices were more than fair. Everything came out quickly and was hot and delicious.

Here's the thing....I saw management. There was obvious discombobulation in her appearance, which probably resulted in things just not being organized throughout the restaurant. Something about the atmosphere was off, and I find that is usually is a result management needing retraining or replacing.

Looking forward to going back to see Corinne. Corporate, pay attention to your management at this location and I'll bet you can turn things around in no time!"}
{"text":"I am a regular and I love your service! You guys create such a great environment for families to have dinner. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Me and my family of six enjoy having dinner here at Red Robin.  The Tavern Burgers are delish! It is better to come before the dinner rush.  The hostess and waitress n waiters are awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent, their burgers are very good - based on a $6 medium sized burger, and a decent $5 beer (except the burger was ~$14 and the beer [22 oz] was ~$8). The beer selection is VERY limited (ONLY 2 decent microbrews). (This is clearly not Chicago, so why the Chicago prices?). The staff was friendly, the service was great - no problem there."}
{"text":"The food quality is consistent and the servers are attentive and friendly. Always busy on a Friday night with mix crowds -- couples, singles, families. They provide a kiosk at each table so you can call for your server, pay your bill, and order desert all at a touch of a screen. Parking can get pretty crowded since it shares it's closest lot with of BevMo's."}
{"text":"Well I just got back from this place. I gave it one more time to see if the service and food would be better. I order something very hard. A cook burger with the stuff I wanted on it. I must say that it came very fast and I know the reason why. The burger was almost totally raw (order it medium) and they didn't get the stuff on it correct. The manager did come by and asked how everything was? I said it was just OK and he was sort of shock. He didn't even asked why... Also I was on the patio. There was this drunk man and he made sure everyone on the patio knew he was there.  I do have to say I been to several Red Robin's and this is the worst one I have ever been to. Like I said I been here before and complain and do you know what?  It never had changed. This is one of the worst place to get a burger, and they are suppose to be a great place to one..."}
{"text":"We just went to the Red Robin at Happy Valley in Arizona...I can honestly say we will NEVER go to a Red Robin again.
I'm from Seattle which is where the original Red Robin is so I know what the quality and service should be, and this restaurant was no where even close.
The host was obviously undertrained.
There were several people there to pickup food that wasn't ready yet. The manager was apologizing to 3 separate parties.
Went we finally got seated there were several tables needing to be cleared which could be why the lobby was full.
We did have a very nice server who was running his tail off trying to cover 2 tables of 8. One of the tables had 2 screaming kids.
But the restaurant was messy and the knife we were given had something left over from the last use. The glasses were spotted with hard water drops. And to top it all off the food wasn't very good either.
Again I have eaten at Red Robin since the first one opened. I know my RR. This store is giving the entire chain a bad reputation.
Shame on the manager."}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of Red Robin since the early days in Washington. The vast majority of the time, I can count on a good or great burger with good or great service. However, it seems that some locations just don't stack up. This one used to be marvelous. Until they moved many of the managers to other locations, and moved a new ones in. Then came the exodus of most (not all) of the good servers.  There goes the neighborhood! Almost overnight, this location went from a 4.5 to a 0.5. It's amazing how much success that good management brings, and how much failure that bad management brings. Hopefully it will be restored to its former glory."}
{"text":"Our family used to come here once a week for lunch or dinner.We stopped that with the new management that came in and things were always messed up.We decided to give them another try and to our pleasure it was great.
Now comes my experience today.Pick up orders are to be picked up from the hostess now.Great...Not.We were told 19mins for our order.I arrived at 20 after 5(20mins from order time) waited in the bar due to no hostess to be found.She finally appears and ask if I am waiting for a pick up,I said yes.Now mind you it is 15mins more by now.The hostess takes care of the gentleman ahead of me.She makes eye contact,I said I am waiting for an order For Katherine,she says it is not ready yet.How does she know?She didn't even check.So I took a seat and waited.5:44pm I paid for our food.5:50pm I received our food.So I waited another 30mins for our food.Unacceptable.We are done."}
{"text":"Well I decided to give this place a go, I am glad that I did! First off they have great service and are very friendly, we got seated immediately as we were over 21 and went to the bar area. We got the short stack of onion rings (6 rings) and was a lot for me and my lady. The ranch and \"secret\" sauces are great compliments to the onion rings which were hot, crispy, and a good flavor. I had the collossus burger with fries and my lady had the bleu ribbon burger with a BOCA burger substitute and broccoli.  Its great to see that red robins offers the likes of BOCA burgers and gardenburgers as substitutes at no extra cost!  The wait was minimal and the food arrived hot. The steak fries are awesome and the broccoli was also great, especially being bottomless made it all that much better! My burger (collossus) had a burger, brisket, grilled onions, and two types of sauces from what I was reading and it was great! Nice burger flavor, the brisket was tender (could have used a little more brisket but great non the less) the onions were sweet and caramelized to greatness. The colossus was a definite win!! My ladies bleu ribbon burger with a BOCA burger was awesome!! The BOCA tasted very mild compared to a regular burger so the flavors of the supporting ingredients (onions straws, steak sauce, chipotle aioli, lettuce, tomatoes, and bleu cheese) really stood out and had a big taste profile which would almost been forgotten with a regular beef burger. It has been 6+ yrs since ive had red robins and im glad to say that the product is the same and they still have great burgers. Give five guys, in-n-out, and carls jr a break and head on over and see what you think as I hope your experince will be as good as mine!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch.  We were quickly seated in the lounge.  Nice atmosphere.   Friendly staff-quick to refill drinks- Also no waiting.  It was a great seat, not too loud and there was a good hame to watch.

I ordered my burger with added  bleu cheese, red onions (in addition to onion straws that came on it), and sauce on the side.  They forgot the onion straws. Easily fixed-they brought some out on a plate w/apoligies. Everything else was correct about my burger. The burger was cooked correctly but when it came out, I could tell it had been sitting for a bit.  It was luke-warm....not piping hot.  The onion fries they brought out weren't \"hot\" (temp) either.  I also ordeted a side of pickles (after-the-fact) and they were luke warm.  Pickles should have been cold like the red onions and tomatoes, lol.  Never-the-less, It was a very tasty burger and the onions, tomatoes, bacon, pickles added a freshness and crispness that blended well with the burger and bun.

The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy with a nice crispy breadcrumb topping....well worth the upcharge for a premium side dish.  Add some chicken and it is a dish in its own right.

My husband like his lunch....same as mine without all the add ons, lol but with the endless fries. He's not easily impressed so food is food, not something to \"Yelp\" about, lol.  We did order a second serving of the endless fries but it took a while.  We paid our bill and ended up leaving without the second helping. Not a big deal but i would recommend ourdering your \"endless fries\"  when your plate arrives.  That way, you actually get them in a timely manner when you are almost done with the first serving.  (Just a recommendation.)

Overall, it was a nice lunch.  I took a star due to for not getting my food correct/temp of correct add ons.  I'm not sure the disconnect between what the waitstaff writes down and what the cooks \"understand\" but there is no reason that the waitstaff can't check orders to make sure things are correct.  (I did that as a waitress.)"}
{"text":"If your planning on bringing a date or family to this location for an amazing experience then think twice. I haven't been to this red robin in a long time and well it's going to be even longer till next time if I even decide to come back food was ok service was horrible. The price of our lunch I would have been better off going to McDonald's same experience and presentation as this Red Robin just the price would be better. I'm sorry but it would be nice when I eat a meal for you to keep my beverages full table cleaned and to be checked up on more then twice for the entire hour and 20 minutes we were there."}
{"text":"A screaming circus of children and poor service combined with cold food and over cooked fries. I could have went to McDonald's for this."}
{"text":"Honestly the birthday burgers are what I enjoy about coming here, but there is more than meets the eye. Every time I come there is a new burger to try. The shakes are always superb. The staff is decent, they tried putting us at the bar last time when we wanted a normal seat, no biggie ha."}
{"text":"I love red robin!  Always a great choice when I'm craving a burger.  Unlimited fries with any burger order?  I'm a fan.  I love the whiskey river BBQ burger, it's gotta be the best one on the menu!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this carry out order. I cannot believe I paid over $30 for food that was sloppily prepared and over priced. My wrap looked like nothing I would have received if I had been served at a table dining in, was falling apart and mostly mayonnaise. The 7.99 pub mac was the SAME size at my 1.49 side but with bread crumbs and some parsley. Absolutley ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first and last time that I will go to Red Robin.  The waitress, named Katie, was terrible.  The restaurant was only half full, but she took forever to come to our table.    I ordered a black and blue burger. It was just awful and terribly over-priced,  even the tea tasted bad,  I actually left thirsty.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get a decent burger.  I especially like their garden burgers.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food.  Par with other Red Robin's we've been to!"}
{"text":"this place is the best.  The managers are always working their butt off and they have the best customer service i have seen in a long while.  There food is amazeballs! And the prices are very resonable and the portions are good! I am very surprised that this is what we are getting from a restuarant chain!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to waste your time and for the worse possible customer service ever I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Have eaten here MANY times, have never been disappointed! Always received good service and great food!"}
{"text":"Came here after an unsuccessful outing to Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers (service not so great so left to come here) 
Geof is our waiter and this guy should be pulling a clinic in how efficient he is even though this place is busy. Greeted us within a minute after being served. Burgers and fries were good. I am happy!"}
{"text":"Just left red robins at the Galleria and the service was horrible. We were never offered water. The server forgot forks and straws. We never received a refill on our \"bottom less\" fries. All of the servers looked occupied and miserable."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Red Robin and for starters the food was pretty good. The waitress Kelsey when she finally came to the table took about twenty minutes to receive a refill for all four of my guest. The burger a friend got wasn't the way he ordered the bacon was basically burnt. I understand you are busy or short staffed but this is terrible. Once time to pay the check the tablet wouldn't read the card so we informed the waitress and also asked for Togo boxes and Togo cups she attempted to swipe the card but it didn't work again and waitress walked off she was gone for about thirty minutes when she came back she went to the bar and stood and talked to someone sitting at the bar I literally had to yell across the restaurant to get her attention. At the end of the night I never received Togo boxes. That was a horrible first time experience"}
{"text":"Even though Monroeville Mall has now become a Burger Metropolis, I still prefer Red Robin over Winghart's. 

This new Red Robin is in the former Johnny Carino's space. They offer a ton of different burgers and even have turkey and chicken burgers. They also offer salads, ribs, seafood, wraps, soups, chili and a kid's menu.

After you have finished off your food you can wash it all down with a pop, root beer float, freckled lemonade, raspberry limeaid, milkshake, malt, beershake, boozyshake, margarita or another cocktail from the bar.

{"text":"Ordered Online for pick up last night.  Food was overcooked and the guy who packed up our food (from the bar) obviously did not care about what we actually ordered.   

When we got home, I was upset since I had specifically ordered condiments for 2 full orders of fish & chips, so I expected to have some tartar for the fish.  Nope.  Flatware, nope.  Cocktail sauce.  nope.

I guess next time I will have to double, triple check our orders before leaving.  

And I was wondering why NO ONE was there.  Now I know.  I should have checked them out on Yelp first....."}
{"text":"Bad service. We were ignored. Technically we could've dined and dashed, and no one would notice. Don't worry we paid. Still the service was horrible here. Go to a different Red Robin. They're better than this one."}
{"text":"Here is the thing. I like Red Robins. For a chain place I like the concept. This particular Red Robin is closest to my house. So we come here periodically. I come here about 1 time every 6 months. So not a lot. 

But every time I come the same thing happens. The place is trashed. Stuff scattered. Tables not bused, garbage on the floor, and the bathroom is trashed. It's a problem. 

The good. For the most part the service staff is good. All the servers I've ever had but 1 has been friendly and helpful. I like the service staff. 

The food. In my experience it is pretty decent and consistent no problems. Though they seem to skimp on the fries the 2nd and 3rd round. And it takes awhile to show up. 

Biggest issues is the cleanliness. Fix that and it's not bad. I'd come more often."}
{"text":"We went to this location for the first time today! They were VERY busy and there were a lot of people waiting to be seated.  We were told the wait time was around 20 minutes, but they had a good system going and it only took 10 minutes.  Our waitress was extremely nice and took the time to explain some of the items on the menu to my 9 yr old son! The food was fresh, hot and tasted great and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Very kid friendly (as are most Red Robin's); and the food was tasty as usual.  But this particular location raised the bar on quality customer service.   Kudos to our server and management team for proactively addressing a couple of things that went wrong with our meal. We are out-of-towners to Madison; but we will let all our local friends know about our wonderful experience here.  And when we come back this way, we'll pack up the kids and head to this Red Robin location!"}
{"text":"Drove by: the restaurant was so slow it looked closed. My boyfriend and I decided to chance it and see if they are open... Worse case is we would walk over to sushi loca if they were closed. 
Walked in and there was no host. Walked back all the way to the bar just to get service, only to find the bartender on his phone. We decided to sit at the bar  because  the game was on. As we waked to our tables the bar was gross, and tables were full of old food and drinks and wet napkins. I almost wanted to walk out but we decided to stay. The bar was dirty too, and of course the bartender wiped down the bar with a smelly rag. He took our order and our food came out quickly. Sandwiches were hot but fries we cold. I got up to wash my hands in the restroom and only to discover the rest of the restaurant was dirty. Wet napkins all on the floor, along with food crumbs and old drinks. Meanwhile all employees were out by the bar on cell phones, laughing and joking with the managers. Prolly will not come here again based on how dirty the restaurant was and the lack of unorofesisonalism of staff. I decided to be nosey and look at one of the checks left on the dirty tables... We came in at 9:30 pm to eat and the check said 7:38pm so that means the mess was left on the table since that time. Ewwww!
--- update I gave this place another try and it came out better. I will only dine in if ****Mindi*** the shift manger is working. She has great customer service and runs a tight ship! Thanks Mindi!!!"}
{"text":"Service was ok but not great. Both my wife and i had two styles of burgers. They looked great but the meat lacked flavor. There is better burgers out there for lesser price."}
{"text":"All I wanted last night was zucchini that was the spears not the coins! I found them!! The service was outstanding the food was amazing overall experience was absolutely outstanding! Thank you for making my night with just what I wanted!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Little on the greasy side. Makes my stomach turn a little. Tried the Guinness shake...soooo gooooood"}
{"text":"Nope....besides the fries, ranch dip and the strawberry lemonade everything else just sucks.....it's not worth the money with so many other options out there. Service was bad and we froze because they had a large party and we had to suffer for it. It was my birthday \"celebration\" back in May and we haven't been back since. Sad because I used to like this place."}
{"text":"Onion ring tower is great. Burgers are very good, especially for a chain. Garlic fries are awesome, and wine prices downright cheap. Only negative is that there is often debris on the floor from previous diners. They need to be a bit quicker at cleaning it up. Other than that very good. Service is very good too. Hard to beat for the money."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened to this place. Used to be our favorite restaurant in area mainly because of the balloons that my kid enjoyed. Not sure why the balloons stopped but that is the least of the issues lately. Last few times here, the service has been extremely slow and the food only so so. Yesterday, our server had at least 6 tables, all with at least 3 guests per table. He did the best he could and felt bad for him but still made for a less than stellar experience. Our server seemed to be the only one breaking a sweat. 
Overall we have been very disappointed our last few visits."}
{"text":"So after catching a movie we stopped by to check  the wait here..not too bad. We opted for the bar area (no wait)..I went with the Keep It Simple on Italian bun (spell check won't let me enter the correct name) with Boca patty. I love that I have a choice of Boca or Garden burger...Tip: Order it cooked well since the middle tends to come a bit cold...Very good burger..My other half enjoyed his Seafood Scatter but was a bit too much food for him..A busy bar means a bit of noise. Enjoyable meal. The brownie a bit dry but so so...I'd give this location 3.5..."}
{"text":"Not sure I understand the negative reviews here... Burgers, Beers and Fries... 'Nuff said. It's a burger joint. The only thing I could even imagine to be negative about is having kids in the bar, but oh well! My serve Stephanie was awesome and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Red Robin is one of those places that takes me back to my childhood. Growing up in the Seattle area, it was one of those fun places that we always went for birthdays or just special nights out. It was a real treat to go to the original location and when I turned 21, my girlfriends and I found ourselves sitting out on the Seattle waterfront far too often.

Fast forward to 2013...when did this place get so freaking expensive?! I'm not sure why I am surprised, but I am. Just like every other mediocre chain restaurant, prices go up, service and quality go down. I'm left with serious eating remorse and I'm kicking myself for dropping $45 on a meal last night that could have been spent in one of our far superior local establishments.

I have been getting the Bleu Ribbon Burger since it was introduced to the menu years ago, but last night I didn't feel like spending $10.79 on one burger so I went with the Patty Melt. It was good enough, and I was pleased. I do love the Red Robin fries and I'm a sucker for their honey mustard. I finished my basket of food and I was actually pretty full. Maybe I didn't need that big burger after all.

My husband had the Veggie Burger. Kids had the Pizza and the Mac and Cheese. No complaints.

Our waitress was nice and fairly attentive. It wasn't busy and we were seated right away. Drinks took longer than usual to come out but that's because our waitress dropped my husband's beer. No big deal, accidents happen. I had a good view of the kitchen and watched one worker stand around and play on his phone for a good chunk of time we were there. (Employees on their cell phones while working really irks me). We were seated under the air conditioning so it was really cold. (Someone once told me that keeping a restaurant really cold was a way to move people out quicker. Not sure if that's what they were going for, but it's always on my radar now.)

I'd like to say that I have learned my lesson, but I'm sure I will be back because my memories of the past always seem to win."}
{"text":"we went to go get a free burger because thats what reward was showing on my app. However because of their promotion we had to do the buy one get one 50% off. unless we prepared before hand and selected to get the free burger when we went to Red Robin. I don't like this because its forcing me to use what promotion they are running versus getting my reward I earned. 
 My server acted like it was a unreasable request to pick my reward versus their promotion. I feel like the automated paying at the table is moving away from good custoemr service as well. Red Robin is one of my favorites to go to . I will continue to go there however I wish they would take a look at their processes. 

My server was ok however I've had better. My burger was excellent and always is. thats why i'm a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Well I really like the improvements they made here. Last visit the menu was just a two sided laminated card. Now the extensive menu is a mini booklet. New drinks. Some new appetizers too.

 Still I wasn't impressed with the new signature burger that is being marketed. Pepper & Smoke.  Smoked sea salt, smoke and pepper ketchup black pepper bacon. Ciabatta bread.   Sounds awesome!  Good combo of ingredients! Sadly execution wise the handmade Angus Beef burger was a fail here.  I didn't taste a hint of pepper or smoky flavor at all.  Now that I think back on it could be they gave me the wrong order since it resembled more like a bbq burger with fried onions and bbq sauce.  Either way though, the patty was dry and no flavor.  

I really liked the service though this time around.  The side of  Yukon potato chips and onion dip is pretty good and I like the price points for the sides 3,5 and 7 dollars.  So maybe I'll just keep this place in mind for happy hour."}
{"text":"Red Robin has slowly been going down hill and this location is no exception. I have been there several times over the past 10 months and each time the food was a little stingier and not so good and the service was a little worse. 
Today I went in for a quick meal before an apt I had. It was 515 and they were at about 1/3 capacity. As soon as I entered and told the hostess it was just me she looked more then annoyed. It took her and another girl about 4 minutes to figure out what to do with me. On top of this they both disappeared not giving any description of when they would be back. To top it off when the one girl returned she was paying more attention to the text messages on her phone then to me.
I will never understand why service is terrible when you are by yourself. These hostesses literally made me feel like I was inconveniencing them. I almost walked out. 
It took about 5 minutes for a waitress to come to my table, she was nice just a little slow. I ordered my burger without a few items and it came out completely wrong. Since the service was slow I didn't feel like complaining. I finished y burger and had to wait about 15 minutes until someone checked on me. I tried to pay my bill at the table but it wasn't working. 
The food was actually pretty good compared to the other times"}
{"text":"I went out on a date with my girlfriend who drove down from Maryland for Lunch. Service was above par, Both sandwiches were done well, and we enjoyed our time at Red Robin. The only complaint I had was the fact that the fries that were served with the burger were luke warm at best and I requested a new order, and received a fresh batch, hot. They were delicious."}
{"text":"Went there last night to take advantage of their 20% discount under their loyalty program, but was quite disappointed by their service. I arrived on time and called in for my curbside takeout. After waiting 30 minutes and calling in twice to get my food an being told it was on it's way, I had to go in to restaurant to personally pick it up. I was told someone forgot to bring it out. I am very, very disappointed in their customer service an will definitely think long and hard before going back. When I got home with the food, fries were limp and cold. Unknown how long my food had been sitting under the heating lamps. I would have cancelled my order if I could have when I had to go in to pick up my food."}
{"text":"For a chain you can't beat it! Their burgers are so good and the service is always awesome. Our service today was nothing but top notch. Our waitress was completely attentive and friendly. I had the Big Sky Burger again. Totally worth a try if you are looking for something different from your usual."}
{"text":"This last time I went it was great! There was 6 of us, the food and drinks didn't take to long. I got a Bacon cheeseburger (YUM!) and we got recommended a drink called \"Sand In My Shorts\" it was surprisingly good. Some of the times we have gone, the service was ok and the food could have been better. But they seem to be improving. The server we got had a great attitude, he was a tad bit slow, but hey there was 6 of us. I like the new look of the restaurant. It's a great spot to grab a bite to eat before/after the movies!"}
{"text":"RR is my favorite burger chain. Enjoyed the guacamole burger this time. Always enjoy the fries. Wish they could have had a better craft beer selection. Service was prompt but it was 8pm on Monday so I would hope so."}
{"text":"My favorite burger chain. Had their teriyaki burger this time. Tasty flavor combo with the pineapple slice and teriyaki sauce. Wish they had a better craft beer selection (some RR's do). Many have the pay-at-the-table wireless devise (sorry, not this RR!). Who cares ... they have great burgers!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there Saturday 5/12 for lunch about noon, and sat in the bar because of the long wait for a table. We were greeted promptly and our order taken and drinks brought. From there it went downhill. We only ordered two burgers with fries, and the drinks. I got the feckled lemonade and refills came before I was with the first, but no one came by to ask my boyfriend if he needed another beer. Our food was brought by someone, not the waitress, and they pretty much set it down and took off. We had no napkins, silverware and he still needed that beer. I even pushed the red button on the electronic menu thing to call server and also pressed the keys to get another beer. No one came. He finally flagged down some worker running by and asked them to get the manager. She came by pretty fast and was very apologetic but it was too late, we both lost our appetites and the food, maybe hot once but it was not now. The beer showed up by from a different person probably from me pushing the electronic menu thing. 
He had the manager take the burger away because he was done with the place. The manager took off 5.99 for my boyfriends burger but I thought I would eat mine. But I tried and  it was now cold and pretty tasteless so I left it with only about 3 bites missing and most of the now cold garlic fries. Never got any of those \"bottomless\" fries either. So I paid $20 bucks for 2 beers and a lemonade and still had to go home to get something to eat. I have been to other Red Robins, but this experience was just absolutely unacceptable. It has not been open long and is within a mile from my house but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Sautéed Shroom Burger and the Bacon Cheeseburger to go. Great flavor on both burgers, great portion size and cooked to perfection. My only wish was there were more steak fries with my meal. I figured since in store they are refillable, why not give a little extra in takeout too? All in all, go get you some Red Robin. Great burger joint in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Garbage, service is just garbage. Food is so-so that's why I'm giving 2 stars. However, my chili cheese fries had no bacon on it as it was supposed to come with it. The jalapeños on top looked like they were chopped by someone who hated their job. They were cut length wise not as pictured where they're cut like a topping. Then to top it off we waited for our waiter and I tried to get other staff members attention before just getting up myself going behind the service counter to get my husband his togo box. Thank goodness we were able to pay without having to wait with the tablet. The food was okay, not worth going back though because the service was just the worst."}
{"text":"Went Red Robin today for my birthday burger, an annual tradition which I usually enjoyed.  Walked and no one was at the hostess stand which is a real pet peeve of my husband.  The rude hostess arrived and Didn't even greet us.  I said table for two and she reluctantly searched for menus.  She dragged herself I to the bar and set the menus on a four person high top.  Still never saying a word to us.  We don't like eating in the bar, especially when there are plenty of tables available, and we really don't like hightops.  We left and ended up at Big Daddy's."}
{"text":"Terrible!! Go out to dinner here and they cannot except a Red Robin gift card! They say gift cards not excepted at this time machine is broken! Wth they tell us after we have eaten then put us on the spot without a means to pay luckily we just had enough to pay with us!! How flipping embarrassing!! Could have warned us BEFORE we ordered!! Wow talk about robbing us out of  a nice night out thank you RED ROBBERS!!!"}
{"text":"Love the menu, they give you a huge amount on your plate. and the inside is very inviting."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Red Robin for a couple years now and love their food and customer service. The California chicken sandwich is delicious!"}
{"text":"I come to this location because it's closer to me. 
So I've been here a good 10 times over the past year. Never really had a bad experience here. I love the whiskey bbq chicken wrap, bottomless fries, and strawberry freckled lemonade."}
{"text":"Their food is always fresh and delicious. Of course I love the bottomless fries, and the freckled lemonade is my absolute favorite!!!
The servers here are always pleasant and helpful"}
{"text":"We were trying to think of a pace to eat in the Centennial area after our visit to the adjacent shopping mall. My boyfriend suggests Red Robin, YUMMM! We were excited walking in- he already knew he wanted the Whisky River BBQ burger with sweet potato fries. 

Cons:
1. We were seated at a visibly dirty booth. I used my hands to sweep the crumbs off the table and seat before the hostess put down the menus and didn't offer to wipe the table down or seat us elsewhere.
2. Service was slow, it took us over 30 minutes from the time we put our order in to receive an incomplete order. My boyfriend got through half his burger before his fries came.
3. The cheese on both of our sandwiches was coagulated on top of the meat and my bun was really soggy- must've been sitting in the window for a while.
4. The bathrooms were a little dirty.

Pros:
1. Most of the food was good; onion rings and vanilla milkshakes especially. 
2. Regular fries come bottomless (we usually upgrade our side though).

All in all, we probably won't be back to Red Robin for a while- if I had another choice for burgers (in this case you have at least 2- In-N-Out and Smashburger) I would probably head there. There's a certain expectation of service for $40 at a burger joint, and RR was severely disappointing this time around."}
{"text":"Red Robins has always been one of my favorite places to eat with my family, it's to bad this Red Robin failed to meet the high standards that all it's sister stores have excelled in. Our appetizer came out after our meal. Room temp drinks and fries soaked in grease. After one bite I couldn't bring myself to take another. Will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"This place never really does an amazing job with their customer service but the food is good. They're nice, but they're not quick to refill your glasses either."}
{"text":"I usually have decent meals here at Red Robin.  The location is easy to find at the Galleria Mall.   It's located right off of Sunset and you can see their restaurant sign from the parking lot.  Since it's at the mall, it's usually pretty busy from open to close but I can usually get seated fairly quickly.   They do have tables in the bar area so you don't have to wait if you don't want to.   

The menu is pretty huge with so much to choose from.  They have such a great selection of different burgers!  I always order medium rare and they do a good job with getting that right.  I have a love/hate relationship with their french fries.   I love them and hate that they are unlimited!  On my last visit I tried their sweet potato fries.  They bought out a huge side of them.  Unfortunately they weren't cooked long enough and almost like I was eating raw potatoes.  Strange.   I had to ask them to cook more.  Hopefully that doesn't happen on a consistent basis.  I will note that their kitchen seems to take longer than most places to prepare your meals.  Maybe that's why I get appetizers since I'm waiting a while.  

Customer service here is really hit and miss.  You can get a really upbeat waiter/waitress one day but the next they are a downer.  I do, however, realize on a regular basis the servers don't really come back to the tables as often as they should.  Drinks do go empty and I'm always looking around for them to get the check.  

In my opinion there are better places for burgers with better service.  I keep holding out hope they will improve."}
{"text":"Ordered a skinny margarita which was way to sweet. We ordered the guac and salsa which said now more guacamole which was actually a tablespoon of guacamole and a tablespoon of pico with soggy chips. My vegan burger was good and my friend ordered a medium burger but came well done. Our service at the bar was good. The place is definitely not clean and needs some work. Guess this place is better for kids not a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Decided would grab a burger and a beer at the bar. Bartender named Brittany must have been to overworked to do her job.  Apparently one person at the bar and a table of two is to much for her. Did I mention I was the only one at the bar? She snapped at me when I sat down and asked if I was an online order? Her interaction with me was real short as if she was bothered to take my order. She was to busy interacting with coworkers and complaining about someone not taking her shift. Been going to that location for awhile and no problems before. would walk back out though if she bartending again if I go back. there many other locations that have staff that is cool"}
{"text":"Good food. But overpriced. Why pay $10 for a burger? Although they do have endless fries! Fun family place but again, overpriced."}
{"text":"Deciding whether to eat here or not because of the wait, my boyfriend and I went in and took the shot anyway. As we entered, I asked for a table for two. The lady said \"The bar is open would you like to take a seat?\" The bar was packed but we got a seat in the corner. It was still dirty and no one cleaned up the table. It took them 20 mins to get it cleaned.

Let's call him D. D was our server and then someone else came to serve us. I wasn't sure which server we had but ended up getting two. My boyfriend told the second server we were being served by D already but he wanted to switch D for the second server since D was busy.

Not the best experience dine in at Red Robin here. At first it was the worst customer service from both waiters. I mean we actually had two and neither of them came back to check up on us to see how we were doing. I've seen D check up on the table next to ours, just the two ladies chatting. I don't know if it's a bad spot to sit on this corner where the bar is, the spot where you can see the monument valley picture frame, yeah that's where we're seated. 

D came back 30 minutes later telling us the fries will be coming. Honestly it's not that busy now but I don't know.

We waited 20 more minutes for our food to come and our water was low so we waited till whoever can come back. Our second batch of fries that we ordered came in when my boyfriend was already finished with his meal.

Right then and there we just wanted to leave. We also wanted to catch a movie at the AMC right across the street, but had to wait till our waiter brings us our check. It took awhile. By our surprise, D brought his manager to our table and he said that D apologized and wanted to make our experience better. The manager said \"We apologize and wanted to make this night special for you guys. We're really sorry. Is there anything else we can do for you two?\" My boyfriend said that we were just trying to get out of here and get our check. He took out his coupon with a 50% off of a dine-in only. The bill came out like $18.. I then gave the manager my card, the manager came back and with a new check, we only had to pay $3.. which was really sweet of them to do. As we were getting ready to head out the manager and D apologized one last time but we said it's ok and thank you. The manager paid for most of it while I only paid the $3..

You have your good days and you have your bad days. But don't let those bad days get you down. Everyone has their days and that's ok! They handled it well. Thank you to the manager and D - David.

We were too late to catch our movie so we just went home and drank some wine and slept. Tonight was not the best but glad to have spent it with my love - Happy 1 Year Anniversary!"}
{"text":"We visited there on a Saturday after graduation. I usually order the same thing, the Bbq whiskey chicken sandwich. It was just ok, there was more bread than chicken breast and there were a few fried onions sitting soggy underneath the chicken breast. I just didn't like the sandwich but the service was good, there were about 10 of us at the table."}
{"text":"I've had great service almost every time I've been to this location. Price is okay but fries are a little TOO oily sometimes. The last time we came in we saw a waitress we hadn't seen in awhile and she was still just as friendly and remembered us. Very helpful and very quick. The quality of the burgers have always been up to par."}
{"text":"Found the food to be very tasty and no issues with the service.  Have dined in several times as well as carry out, all was good.  Love the burgers!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I always sit in the bar because the line is usually out the door. We always get friendly, attentive servers. No order screw ups. Love the unending happy hour specials - huge $4 drafts."}
{"text":"I was craving a whiskey river wrap. I've not often been so disappointed. The restaurant had fairly slow traffic, to be expected at 8pm on a Thursday. After we ordered, it seemed to take a long time for our food to arrive, this purely subjective as we weren't timing it. My girlfriend ordered clam chowder. It arrived crusty and congealed with none of the promised bread from the menu. My wrap was more in line with a BBQ chicken flauta, it wasn't terrible but not what I had been craving. The waiter said he would get us refills, then proceeded directly to the bar to watch the football game. This happened twice while we were paying attention. We decided to go ahead and take the survey, after we had payed at the kiosk, so that the management would have the opportunity to address the situation internally. One of the questions asked if the restaurant was clean and that's when I realized that the floors were filthy. Red Robin...yumm!"}
{"text":"Let's start off with the adorable Jesse Jackson taking our take out order. 

Yes we need to mention her full name since they have a handful working there. Not only has she been such a friendly person to us from the time she answered, but she was super funny as well. \"So you want a cheese burger with no patty on the sauce\" lol. She cracked up and so did my husband. The food, I mean, Yuuuummmmmm... lol #CornballJoke 
Love the whiskey burger. Especially with avocado on the side. 
It's people like Jesse that would make me come back every week. 

Oh, and the 10th burger free reward that we got today 

Jesse, you're amazing girly and we appreciate you're fun and positive energy 

She could def teach some other waitresses and waiter some customer service skills!!"}
{"text":"We love the food. The burgers are good and the service is standard sit-down. However, the company recently decided to do a calm renovation with color changes, seating updates, and new pictures on the wall, etc. Someone decided it was a good idea to pile eight to ten good sized tables in an area entirely too small for this endeavor. Red Robin has perfected the art of herding cattle. Their customers are moved in like cattle and are as close to one another as possible without actually having someone sitting on a stranger's lap. From the moment you order, until you pay your bill, someone is bumping into your chair and knocking that gourmet burger out of your hands. The waitstaff is either bumping into your table or apologizing for doing it earlier. Seriously? I get they need to make money but would two less tables kill you? Your customers wouldn't feel like sardines and I could actually get out of the restaurant without doing a double handspring over the poor older man on the outermost aspect of the corner table. I'll be dining somewhere else that doesn't have me touching the elbows of every other resident in Surprise."}
{"text":"My family & I have been to this RR several times and have never had a complaint about their customer service, it's always been top notch......however tonight there was kinda a hiccup. The hostess who sat us was none to happy to be at work tonight. To start she didn't greet us as she led us to our table, didn't say two words, then she sat us at a dirty table. We asked her to wipe it down and she did but left it so wet that my husband had to flag her down and ask her for some napkins so we could dry it. She brought us the napkins and still did not say two words to us. Both my husband and I found it upsetting since we've never had any customer service issues at this location. At our first opportunity we asked to speak to the manager, he came promptly and we discussed our concerns with him. He understood our issues, promised us that he would coach the young lady offered to give us 25% off our meal, which we didn't ask for or expect, we were still planning on eating there we just wanted the problem to be addressed with her. He delivered our dinner himself, checked on us several times, even stopped and chatted and then told us he would take care of our entire bill!!! Needless to say we were shocked!  It was totally unexpected. The manager, Jim, and the server, Ashley, did an excellent job of turning a bad experience into a great one!"}
{"text":"I love their garden burgers.  Did u know u can substitute with a garden burger for any of their gourmet designer burgers?  And can't say enough about all u can eat fries !  Normally I don't go for flavored teas, but I'm addicted to the pomegranate tea.  Very flavorable and just a little bit tart, really refreshing. And the staff are all very friendly and super professional."}
{"text":"Can't really say anything about the food. We checked in to be seated. They told us to wait to the side. They proceeded to seat other people ahead of us. When I asked them why,they said those people were sitting at the bar. That made no sense, it was 11 am and the place wasn't busy. When they finally offered to seat us we asked for a booth. They said sorry, no, there weren't enough servers to accommodate that. We just left after that. Not a good first impression"}
{"text":"Like all Red Robins, the food is excellent, the staff friendly and a great night out wether you're on a date or with family."}
{"text":"Took my boys and their 2 friends...4 kids and just a mom!  Bottomless delicious steak fries, best burgers and reasonable price for all 5 of us!  Great kid friendly atmosphere and menu!  Num!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went out for a burger today. We went to red robin on superstition springs. My husband was again disappointed by them not having bud on draft like happens everywhere we go almost any more. The food was great, the service was great but unfortunately we won't be going back because of the beer situation. I'm running out of new places to try. Please people help me out and bring back bud draft in your bars."}
{"text":"This was the comment I tried to submit on the red robin website, however the city and location wouldn't populate and they are required fields, so I decided to leave my comments/review here.

Good afternoon - 

My comments are about both the Phoenix Arizona location near Metro Center mall as well as the company's website.

First off, when trying to utilize the coupon that was sent to my email for 35% off to-go orders, I was very frustrated/confused when I created my order and went to check out, and was told that my login wasn't correct and that the coupon was only good with a valid login.   I was further confused when I then logged in to my royalty rewards account with the same information it was telling me was incorrect on the website I was trying to order from.
I called the location to explain the problem in hopes that they would know what was going on and they did not.  They further told me that they would be happy to take my order over the phone but would not be able to apply the code because it was for online ordering only.  I then asked to speak with a manager to see if that would help identify the problem or come to a solution and they said they would see if they could find one.  I waited for over 20 minutes on hold.  I was appalled and frustrated beyond belief.

During the extensive time on hold I took a shot in the dark and tried signing up for (what I thought was) a new account on the website only to come to find out that just because you have a royalty rewards account, doesn't mean you can sign on with the redrobin.com webpage.  This is ABSURD.  Why should I need two different accounts with one restaurant?  

Once completing my order I still was wanting to speak to a manager, but got to the point that I had left the house and was en route to the restaurant so I hung up (after being on the call for 30 minutes).  When I arrived, three hostesses/servers were standing around the host stand (apparently when I hung up, they stopped the search for a manager) and once I got my food, asked the group if there was a manager available. After all kind of looking at each other one left to go get one.

Very frustrating experience given that my fiance and I frequent Red Robin locations on a fairly regular basis.  By far the worst experience we've had and especially disappointing given that this is a recently opened location and one that is closer to us than any other."}
{"text":"Honestly food was ok. She said pink or dark I said pink food came out dark. Tooo busy during bar hour we waited a very long time for everything. Drinks food and dessert but the lady was just tooo busy"}
{"text":"Besides the food always being awesome and the impeccable service by Jacob. I have to give a big shout-out to the manager Kyle he really took care of us and looking forward to seeing them again. Bravo Zulu"}
{"text":"We come here a couple of times a year, mostly because my boyfriend loves their burgers.  I usually try to go for lighter options, so this past weekend when we went there, I ordered a chicken wrap with the fruit salad as the side.  Let me tell you, unless you really like apples, don't order the fruit salad.  There are more apples than anything.......the remainder is some pineapple (seemed fresh), canned Mandarin orange sections (like a couple), and some strawberries that were far from fresh......maybe frozen or canned.   Overall, yucky.

The burgers are always a safe choice, and the fries are steak fries with virtually no seasoning, so if you like plain bland fries, you will love them.  Maybe I'll try a salad next time......and why on earth do they not offer a side salad as an alternative to fries, instead of the awful fruit salad?"}
{"text":"Took about 15 minutes to get our order placed which seemed a little long since their dinner rush didn't have many tables going, but they had gluten free buns which I was super happy about. They don't have dedicated gluten free fryers so I wasn't able to eat my fries but my husband and son loved the extra food. Over all it was pretty enjoyable and after the slow order process the wait staff was on top of it for the rest of the evening."}
{"text":"Another solid visit at Red Robin! 

This time I tried a burger...but not just any burger I tried the Burning Love burger...which has jalapeño coins, pepper jack cheese, salsa, chipotle mayo and lettuce on a jalapeño cornmeal kaiser roll. Whoa....sounds delicious....excuse the drool! 

I made a few substitutions, chose a garden burger instead of the beef patty and left off the salsa...and it was as perfect as I expected! 

The garden burger was delicious and the spicy kick I was looking for was definitely there!! You already know I LOVE the jalapeño coins...but the jalapeño bun and pepper jack cheese were a perfect pairing...totally burning love in my book! 

And what's not to love about endless steak fries...I left stuffed and very happy!"}
{"text":"How do you review a chain restaurant? You know what to expect before you sit down. I have never been here before and was pleasantly surprised. My burger was excellent, the refills kept coming and the kids were entertained. Fun lunch after a big gymnastics meet:)"}
{"text":"I grew up with Red Robin (not this location of course) and although many things have changed over the years, I got exactly what I wanted when I came here last Sunday afternoon. Although I am usually not a creature of habit, when it comes to RR, I have two burgers that I order (not at the same time although I wouldn't be opposed), and I always get the honey mustard with my fries. Everything was exactly as I wanted it. A+ for consistency and meeting my expectations.

After a nice hike, the craving for a burger kicked in, so we found ourselves outside of Red Robin at 10:30am on Sunday. With a half hour to kill we went to some of the other places in the shopping center and arrived back at the restaurant promptly at 11am. We were seated quickly (there were already people inside seated...we weren't the first through the door) and our hostess was very friendly. Our server, Kristina, was over quickly and took our drink order and was happy to bring us fries. Love the bottomless fries!!

The menu has definitely expanded in the last 30 years but the tried and true favorites remain. My two go-to's are the Banzai Burger and the Bleu Ribbon Burger. This trip I had the Bleu Ribbon (no tomato) and it was delicious. Lots of cheese, lots of crispy onion straws. One of the best burgers on the menu. Kristina came by to check on us often and our drinks were refilled when needed. By the time we were getting ready to leave, the restaurant had filled up. I re-signed up for the Royalty program because I guess I never finished my registration the last time I did, we paid our bill, and we were on our way. 

The only downside of the visit was that damn machine that sits on the table, but that doesn't warrant deducting any stars since it's not something that can be changed. Maybe I am old fashioned, but I like the interaction with the server....I don't want to push a button to call them over, I don't want to swipe my card at the table, and I really don't want something sitting there to serve as a distraction for my kids or for anyone else who you are trying to enjoy your day with. I get it...we have to keep up with technology and all these advances, blah, blah, blah...well I hate it. *end rant*

Chances are we won't find ourselves back at this location, only because it's off Happy Valley and we live nowhere close to there. Lucky for us we have a Red Robin opening in Metrocenter, which is closer to home, so we will have many more opportunities to earn our way to free burgers."}
{"text":"I have been a somewhat regular here but after last visit no more. The last time 7 of us went and the service started off good and went downhill fast.  As if we were forgotten about, no refills, no water as requested.   In order to get the check I had to go and ask for it.  We complained and you would expect the manager to make a personal visit but nothing.   And that is how much business they will get from me moving forward ,nothing."}
{"text":"The management of this restaurant has no idea what customer service is about.  The staff made a commitment concerning a promotion they were running.  The manager reversed the commitment a t the end of the meal, and was very rude about it, as well.  This used to be one of my regular favorites, but I will not set foot in this place again.  A letter to the corporate office in Colorado was ignored.  Red Robin sees its customers as a wallet and an open mouth - no more.  Do yourself a favor and go to a restaurant that values your business!!!"}
{"text":"Clean establishment and friendly service. So friendly it seemed like everyone wanted to make sure my teenager and myself were made comfortable and with excellent service. After we left my daughter said she was thinking about asking for ID because so many different people were helping us. She just didn't believe a whole restaurant would be and could be so helpful."}
{"text":"My wife and I took our 20 month old here to eat. Food was what you would expect, not great and not horrible, just average.  Excellent service, very accommodating for people with kids, and fast service.  Four stars for service and attentiveness, 3 stars for food."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is delicious. Drinks are always on point! The chain is pretty consistent."}
{"text":"If you are in the market for a charred to a crisp overdone burger this is your stop! Sadly both of our burgers were overdone to the point that any lover of a juicy medium burger would be turned off.

On the up side our server spotted the lack of enthusiasm and offered us menus to choose new items. Great service, questionable burgers. Pretzel bites are  great! :)"}
{"text":"The service here was amazing. It was a completely packed Saturday night...yet the servers were at the top of their game.  Burger was good....service fantastic.  

I forgot my purse at the restaurant and realized it on Mothers Day morning...called at 9am...2 hours prior to them opening.  They had my purse and waited for me prior to opening just to give it to me....not a penny was missing.  Hard to find honest people willing to go out of their way to help.  Very happy with this place.  Their employees are AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Standard red robin. Same menu. I love the variety of choices you have as far as buns, toppings, fry sauces, etc. I love their drinks as well - milkshakes, refillable root beer floats, strawberry lemonade... all good! 

You have to sign up for their royalty card, it's free. Buy 9 get 1 free on burgers. Also, pretty much every Tuesday during NFL season you get a free Tavern Double with the purchase of another burger. Score! 

Service is ok. Place always seems clean. Would recommend for a good burger for a decent price - especially if you are hungry :-)"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Red Robin since the beginning. I generally love the fries and the Royal Red Robin burger. I recently moved to the Las Vegas area so I was used to quality service and food in my old Escondido, CA location. However, I tried eating at the Galleria location for the first time back in October and the service was slow and the fries were cold. I thought it was a fluke, but I went again with the same result, slow service and cold fries. After the 4th visit with the same results, I've concluded that this place has a problem. Then I went to another Red Robin on Eastern and had the same problems. Is it truly impossible to receive hot fries without complaining about it? Maybe these Red Robins in Henderson should reach out to the Escondido location and emulate their practices, because these two have been disappointing. 

Also, the Galleria spot has a section that I always seem to be seated at that sits flush up against the mall entrance, so you essentially become a spectacle for about 1000 people as they walk into and out of the mall. It makes it feel like I'm eating at a hotdog on a stick in the food court, when all I wanted was a nice atmosphere to eat in. I don't want an audience to stare at me while I stuff my face with a Royal.

The extra star I give them is for being on point with the burgers, those did not disappoint.


Update: Since writing this I have been notified by their corporate office that these locations will be reviewed and might be remedied. I will be heading back to the Galleria location and I'll update my review with whether or not they are still dishing out cold French fries or not. Hopefully they will put up a wall in that section in front of the entrance."}
{"text":"Another bad service experience at Red Robin. Host sits us at a table and probably waited 15 minutes before the host noticed us sitting here with no drinks. Then she went and got our server, and he blamed it on a miscommunication between the host and server, BUT common intuition would tell you that a family of 5 sitting between two of your active tables might mean that you are assigned to serve us. Still sitting here waiting for my kids beverages to show up, if they show up at all. This place is soooooo bad consistently. I think they strive to piss everyone off that comes through the door. 



Went in again today, 1/14, and ordered food for the kids at first. It came out without a hitch, but when my wife 's and my burgers didn't come out after 20 minutes I mentioned it to the server. She went over to the line to find it. 5 minutes later she returned with the cold burgers...."}
{"text":"I have grown up eating at Red Robin and was very excited to see that there was a RR in North Olmsted when I first moved here. I love this place and tend to go several times a month when I am looking for a decent burger and fries. 

The service tends to be pretty good most of the time that I go. Great place for just about any type of food as the menu has a large selection."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Red Robin. They have a tiny covered patio that I love to sit on and enjoy my crispy chicken-tender salad! My husband loves their burgers and their endless steak fries. The inside decor can be a bit garrish and there are usually screaming children so sit on the patio if there is room. You'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"Their glassware and utensils always smell. I can't put my finger on it but they smell bad. We have tried to eat at this location a few times but always end up making the trek to the Red Robin on Mayo."}
{"text":"Service was okay. But had to wait at lunch time on a weekend and there were many tables available. The \"NachOMG\" not so much. Lacking in chili on the plate. and flavor.  Wouldn't eat it again.  Return? Eh!  We'll see."}
{"text":"After a morning of condo hunting my husband and I were starving. We pulled into the first strip mall we found and it turned out to be one with a Red Robin. I'm not normally a chain kind of person but times were desperate. I was surprised at how good my turkey burger was (why its listed as \"Adventuresome\" I don't know...) but it was enjoyable. My husband enjoyed his burger very much, polishing off the entire thing. The best thing about Red Robin is the bottomless steak fries!!! 

It's a diner type place that focuses almost solely on burgers. They have a salad menu but its very limited. It kind of reminded me of Fudruckers, only slightly less greasy."}
{"text":"Jessica S. Is a great waitress with great customer service skills. And what was cute was she bow down to take our order. I wish more waitress would be as good as Jessica S."}
{"text":"Brought a large group of my friends here tonight for an end of the school year celebratory dinner.  Don't go to chains often but a number of the kids have celiacs disease and Red Robin evidently does a good job of isolating out the gluten.   There were a number of mistakes with the ordering, meals that either were not placed into the order queue or just random things that were dropped. My meal was quite decent for $6.99.  Not sure if I'd pay that much extra for the larger burgers.  Fries were tasty and plentiful.  What I really appreciated was the manager coming over repeatedly to apologize for the order mishaps.  She compted us two entrees which were messed up and then gave our table free desserts.  I don't mind mistakes, I just really appreciate when someone acknowledges them and tries to make up for it.  Great job managing guests expectations and making sure people were satisfied.  My daughter also appreciated her Red Robin balloon.  Desserts were delicious.  Might be back for a casual lunch sometime."}
{"text":"I went with myfamily and ordered a glass of wine. Being 42 with my 15 year old daughter with me I didn't think it would be a problem. I was carded and told that I could not have the wine. When asked for the manager, he was very rude and condescending.  He explained state law to me. Which I explained to him I understood. My problem was why being over 40 was I carded to begin with. His attitude and tone were very poor. My party of 6 left and took our business down the street. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food. Amy was a great waitress. She always check on us and really took care of are toddler."}
{"text":"I don't know why I go back, I think it's the fries with their own salt because everything else is poorly done.

I had the French onion soup and I found a whole onion peel....gross (see pic).  And, there was dirt or kitchen burnt something on my plate.  The Manager offered to remake for me, nice but they have to go back and remake?  

Second one was better, but they forgot the garlic toast and when I asked for it they came back with one instead of two so I had to ask for the other one.

By this time 45 minutes had passed and my son was getting ancy.  So he played with he chalk board game-another not so bright idea, chalk was flying everywhere while I tried to enjoy my second meal!

So the no

Overall the kids meal had three small chicken strips and about 2 ounces or broccoli served in their sauce side cup if that tells you just how small it was.

Disappointed with the fries this round, like warm and mushy (the big ones).

If it wasn't for the pleasant server I would have given it ONE star."}
{"text":"3 stars for average.

Sometimes I wonder why I go and than I remember that I need a French onion soup every now and than.

Kids meals: it is not much, 3 small strips and a 1/4 cup of broccoli.  
French onion soup: had a whole onion peel in the soup and the bread inside was burnt.

Remedy:  manager offered to remake herself, okay....thanks.

Second time was better, no dirty plate and no onion skins.  However, missing the garlic toast, requested it and got one piece instead of two had to ask for the other.

During this time my young son was done eating and was bored for the extra 20 minutes he had to wait. 

Bottomless French fries were mediocre.  Not hot not cold somewhere around warm and slightly mushy on the large ones.

This is our fourth visit in 1 year and I think I will read my OWN review if I feel like returning lol?

Ps thank goodness for our warm and friendly server.  That always makes a difference.
Pps if you opt to use the machine to pay or play games, be careful....ours was gross and the calibration was off so it typed 50% accurately."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer to Red Robin for quite some time (as evident by my Red Robin Loyalty Card). My family and I enjoy the atmosphere, the food, and the memories we have formed throughout the years (as evident in our countless family pictures at their establishments). However, I have to review my last dining encounter at their restaurant as a complete and utter disaster. I should start by saying that on this particular day, both of my boys and myself were celebrating the fact that I had completed my Bachelor's degree. So once again, we chose Red Robin to celebrate this occasion (we had previously been to another Red Robin restaurant to celebrate my son's 10th birthday only 13 days prior). It started out like a normal experience, the hostess sat us down and our drink order was taken. On a side note, the freckled lemonade was delicious. My boys ordered their usual mac and cheese and chicken strips. I finally ordered the D.B.G. burger (new item). Long story short, our food came, we started eating and after several checkups from our server and a refill of fries and drinks things took a turn. I had eaten my burger about ¾ of the way when I noticed something different. I thought for a moment that it could have been a thin piece of grilled onions, then I realized my burger didn't have grilled onions. I opened my burger and there it was. . . .a cricket. 


From that point, I took a picture, notified our server which notified the manager on duty. He was very apologetic, mentioned that this had never happened before. He asked me if I was okay and I told him that I had no words. He followed up by saying that we did not have to pay for our meals that afternoon. There was no exchange of anything, they didn't know my name and they certainly did not ask for my number. After everything was said and done, I emailed corporate and sent them the pictures along with my side of the story. I was contacted by the senior manager from the store and was assured that they had taken steps to make sure this situation would never happen again. He mentioned how he wanted to make everything better and wanted to invite my whole family back to his establishment. I told him that what I wanted was to be acknowledged and to not have this happen to anybody else. He insisted that we needed to come back and told me that he was to send a gift card so my WHOLE could have a better dining experience.  I received a $30 gift card with no note.  Again, I have no words. Thank you for making me feel like a valued customer."}
{"text":"I went to RR for the first time in almost 10 years this past weekend and wasn't impressed at all. The staff / manager were friendly and attentive. The food was mediocre. There's nothing that really stood out to make me want to return again. The salsa/guacamole/chips appetizer was $7 and was a ridiculously tiny serving for a small group. My grilled chicken sandwich was drier than the Sahara desert. It'll probably be another 10 years before I go back."}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price.  Really good service.  Location is very close to San Tan Mall, so it is a great place to stop before or after shopping."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean and well maintained.  Prices are very reasonable.  Food is great and the kids love it (kid friendly with balloons)."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this Red Robin many times now and we love it! They are clean and always have great service! I have to say though, today we had Laurie C as our waitresses and she was EXCELLENT, I have never had a server at any restaurant be so polite, friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"The service was great!!!! And the burgers are so good. And you can't beat the bottomless fries and strawberry lemonade. I was dissatisfied with the milk shake. The use soft serve ice cream for their shakes but regular ice cream is available. The shake tasted like cardboard. I will defiantly try another desert option next time."}
{"text":"Best burgers and Long Islands!! Service is always friendly and fast. The tavern burgers and kids menu will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and have always sat in the bar area (or at the bar directly). I have received both good service and bad service here. 

The good is self-explanatory. 

The bad experiences I've had here are basically formed around the fact of attentiveness. Sometimes you feel a bit lost. It may be different in the main restaurant, though. Also, the last time I went they had the AC on full blast so I was a bit chilly."}
{"text":"It's a chain, so I know the food is decent. I'm mostly turned off by the fact that I couldn't come here to watch a baseball game. No sports package at a popular burger place? I'll be going elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"I have had a good experience at this location. The manager is very attentive and quick to solve any issues that arise."}
{"text":"If you like burgers, this is the place to be. The wrap was great as well. Simple family friendly restaurant"}
{"text":"OMG  yasss! First time here Great service awesome food BARTENDER was on point (Natalie) ... THANK YOU!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this location last night.  Like other reviewers have mentioned the service was bad.  I felt ignored by our server. Our food took a long time to come out on what seemed to be a slower night. When the food did arrive is where the real issues started.  The burgers we ordered to have a slight pinkness were over cooked and the burgers were cold. The endless fries and endless broccoli looked like a half filled dish. The bottom of the broccoli pieces were brown also.  Only after we mentioned the burgers being cold did the next fill of fries and broccoli actually look full.  They did give us a family discount to help make up for our troubles.  A burger place that failed to do burgers right.  I don't plan to return here anytime soon. Maybe if they address the issues that I as well as others on here experienced then I will be back."}
{"text":"This is the best Red Robin!!! My family's go to spot. Awesome service and delicious food. Never disappointed"}
{"text":"Looking for a change from the Chili's type restaurants - then check out Red Robin. My kids love the menu options for them such as pasta, chicken fingers, etc. and I can always find a healthier option for myself such as the grilled chicken and salad, etc. that are very tasty. My friends love the burgers as they have many different kinds and a good seasoning. I tried the burger one time without the bun as I've been avoiding grains and it was very good.

Food comes out quickly, the servers are very nice, all in all its what you would hope for at a convenient, inexpensive quick dining experience."}
{"text":"This location has upped their game since the last time we were their 3 1/2 years ago. Our server Lis was ver speedy and friendly. The food was very good and we were stuffed. The manager stopped at all the tables and it reflects the staff focuses on the customer experience. We plan on comming back in the near future."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch yesterday and I've never been more dissatisfied with a Bacon Cheeseburger.  The patty didn't have any substance or taste.  The whole thing was rather mushy.  I don't think I'll be revisiting RR anytime soon.  BTW, server--Paige and manager --??,  were very pleasant and helpful, but I didn't complain while there."}
{"text":"My 17 year old is a MONSTER FAN!!  YUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMM!!! So he gets 3 of the 5 stars.  He would heat there daily if he was allowed to and as long as he had someone paying for it.  
 
Since I am paying for it I will say, I LOVE the drinks. The food isn't above average or really anything to write home about. 

The service is a big deal for me and I was impressed with the service.  Our waitress and two others were very friendly and actually kept us giggling through out the meal.

It isn't a top choice on my list but when I am feeling generous I let my son pick the dinner spot. It is better than Chilis or TGIF....but not my top choice of dinner runs."}
{"text":"I just can't with this place any more.  Red Robin used to be a fun family place, then they tried to make it upscale and got rid of the games, kids coloring pages, large balloons, fun posters etc....  I've never thought the food was that great, but the shakes are awesome and the kids used to like it. Going in there now is the utmost test in patience and tolerance.  The service is horrible (more because they seem understaffed than because the servers are inept), and there are fewer menu options and higher prices.  The number of kids in there and the noise level will drive you to drink; but not there, because the glasses are dirty and the manager will tell you that boogers on the glasses are just scratches.  Oh, and the bathroom is disgusting. If there is no soap and the trash is overflowing, then I'm not sure any of the employees are going in there let alone washing their hands.  In my opinion, Red Robin turned their backs on their customer base by trying to upgrade and make it more adult. I would never go there with all adults and it's not really fun for kids anymore.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"When they are good, they are very, very good. When they are off their game they are horrible. 

Recently, we have had a string of bad experiences with this Red Robin - to the point that we are seeking a new burger place. We always do take out and our order is almost always wrong. I tried to do curbside pickup and called the number when I arrived to be placed on hold for 9 minutes while I waited. Finally, I went inside to get the order and was treated rudely by the staff. They just don't seem to care."}
{"text":"Been to RR a number of times, but amazingly, BF never has, so we stopped in for lunch. Busy restaurant, yet we were seated immediately. Good selection of appetizers and for BF sake, had to order the short tower of onion rings which arrived right after our cold beers. Mmm, crunchy and steaming hot.  BF had the Prime Chophouse burger with horseradish sautéed mushrooms and I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger with onion straws. I like how the server asked if we wanted \"no pink or some pink\" on the beef, easier than figuring out medium vs well done.  Our burgers were great looking and fabulously tasty. The steak fries were sizable planks,  lightly crisped, delicious sides. They'll bring more if you request,  but one serving was more than enough for each of us.  Oh so full.  Did we stop there? Ohellno, we ordered the Freckled Strawberry Lemonade cake to go, but after just a little try (betcha can't eat just one), we ate it all up ... nothing left to go! Light lemony cake, simmered strawberries on the side topped with whipped cream turned out to be something we couldn't resist. We will wander back here on another lazy Sunday to try other burgers, especially since they have NFL games on nearby screens."}
{"text":"Seems like every time we give this place a second, third, fourth etc chance it never fails to disappoint! Are server is rude, the food is cold, we don't get a meal we ordered etc. we will not be going back, ever! If it's not one thing it's another. It used to be great... What happened??"}
{"text":"The place sounds like a pediatric waiting room. So we like to sit at the bar, away from the screaming. 

We just went in and saw two empty tables in the bar. We asked for one of those and they said no problem, it will be 10 minutes to get them cleaned up. 

We sat in the Doctors/restaurant waiting room, sandwiched between two kids crying at full volume. 

Then they said they were ready to seat us, and started leading us to a table in back, in the middle of the exam room chaos. 

We told them we asked for a table in the bar. They said the two empty tables were unavailable. 

Why they didn't tell us that 15 minutes before is a mystery, we didn't wait to have explained. 

There are lots of other restaurants in the area. We will frequent them in the future!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food.  We did have to wait a little while(less then 30mins) but that is to be expected on a Friday night. The young lady who took our names in the front for the list was super nice and pleasant.  Our waitress was very engaging and sweet.  She checking in in us and made sure we had what we needed.  She offered great options my son in desserts!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant perhaps five times before, I really like Red Robin but this was my worst visit. (10/6/14) i started going to RR in 2009 about once a month or more.

We arrived about 5:30pm, the place was busy, we sat in the bar. There was a drunk guy watching football yelling loudly at the TV behind the bar, people were glaring at him. This loser had no clue.

Normally, we're served in about 12 minutes, the food is very consistent. Today our food was luke warm, the fries about room temperature. I thought about asking to have my plate nuked but I never send food back, never. The wait this time was 22 minutes, which probably explains the cool food. 

And did I miss something, when they started serving fries in these round metallic rings did they also stop the endless fries thing?

I think a very similar burger would be the Fudd's half pounder. I think next time we'll go to Fudds instead. This visit really soured me on RR.

Oh yeah, their seasoning salt now has sugar added. Another brand bites the dust."}
{"text":"Picked up a burger to go so I could get home and watch The Bachelor.  When presented with my order, Sam the bartender gave me an extra cup of fries to eat in the car on the way home!!!  5 stars for that!!!!  Got the Chophouse....was worried the steaksauce would be over-powering, and wasn't (I don't like steak sauce)  Stayed hot in new packaging and very tasty.  But the cup of fries was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Arrived Saturday afternoon around 4.  They were surprisingly busy.  And I made allowances for that this review.

There were four of us.  Two of us had burgers. One had a salad. One had fried cod.

The meat patties themselves were cooked correctly.  But the buns were barely toasted.  I requested dark caramelized onions and only had a small dollop on my burger.

Other than that it was OK considering how busy they were, except for the deep fried cod.

It was not cod.  It was closer to tilapia in texture and taste.  The manager kept insisting they only stocked cod.

I grew up eating seafood on the coast and cod has a distinct flavor.  It wasn't old cod which would have had an old \"fishy\" taste.  It was some other species of mild tasting white fish and it was old.  The fryer oil had not been changed so the crust was greasy.

They didn't charge us for it, but the person who ordered it was really disappointed because they were looking forward to deep fried cod with chips or fries.

If you go here stay away from the deep fried fish."}
{"text":"We eat at Red Robin at least 12 times per year - and celebrate every birthday in my 7 person family here as well. Personally, I LOVE RR burgers. The food is always excellent - never a complaint from me. I have to say that in all the years I've been eating at RR (in Massachusetts and the last 2 years in Surprise) I cannot understand why the prices keep increasing and the portions seem to be dwindling. Probably the most obvious is this silly \"Gladiator Cuff) that they just started using for the fries... it hold about 15 fries and is a perfect way to make it so that you get less.

The Surprise location seems to have an incredible employee turn-over. When we live in MA, we had the same server for almost 1-year. Here in Surprise, we have had a different server every time we've gone. The service struggles desperately at the Surprise location. We always visit with 7-8 people in our party, and that in-itself is an undertaking for any server, I know. But I'm constantly amazed at how many times we have to ask for refills, or ask for more baskets of fries, or long waits for shakes, or long waits for napkins. Two months ago, our server was so bad that I had to complain to the manager that we had been seated for 45 mins and hadn't received our meals - he then took on the role of our server.

It really is kind of sad when we all say \"Let's go to Red Robin\" and the conversation then goes into the bad service experiences we've had in the past 2-years. I hope they get a handle on this because we really are loyal customers."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Just your standard chain restaurant. Then only plus side to here Is the bottomless fries and root beer floats! Yes... bottomless root beer floats! BUT... do not order anything from the table order kiosk thing they have added. Server told us that they are never notified when their tables oder anything so just stick to ordering with the actual person!"}
{"text":"Ambience: There were six of us for dinner including two grandchildren ages 4 & 7. Showing up with 6 people for dinner at other restaurants has presented a major problem, not so at this Red Robin. Despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded with people waiting, after just 5 minutes they seated us at a round table that was an appropriate size for 6 people. We were far enough away from other tables that we didn't feel like we were bothering people at the next table with our children and the other tables were far enough away from us that their kids didn't bother us. The restaurant provided balloons and crayons and paper to draw on for the little ones. This is a major asset.
Food: you don't come to Red Robin for gourmet food. You come for good food at fair prices. The children's menu is fairly extensive. And it is reasonably priced. We had one mac and cheese and 1 grilled cheese sandwich. I sampled each and both were really good. It came with sides that included a choice of a couple of fruits or vegetables or the omnipresent french fries. I had the Southwest grilled chicken salad. The salad was fresh, the chicken was tasty, and they had fried jalapeno that were surprisingly delicious. The portions were large so no one left hungry.
Service: our waiter came to our table fairly rapidly after we sat down. He took our drink orders immediately. He came back for a food order in a timely fashion. He got everything right. Service with a smile. I especially liked that the restaurant manager was present throughout the meal and stopped by our table at least 2 times to make sure that everything was going well.
Overall, an excellent place to come with kids where both the kids and the adults can enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"Food was DISGUSTING and waiter was rude. They did not bring our food out in timely manner. Did not refill our drinks and did not provide us bottomless fries as they advertise. The food was extremely greasy and salad was poor.  The messed up our meals multiple times.The avacado was hard to bite down on. Our 1st and LAST time going here."}
{"text":"Not sure why other reviewers are unhappy about this place. I go often to dine in each 2-3 weeks and have never been down with this place. Service is excellent, burgers are what expected, and the atmosphere is great. It happens that the place gets messy when is overcrowded but overall satisfying for the tummy!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan, though, I'm not the biggest fan ever. Their performance is solid, I've yet to have a bad experience, though at times I question the quality of food being served at this location.

Some backstory: The town I grew up in for middle and high school had Red Robin Gourmet Burgers. It was frequented on a daily basis and almost never had non peak times. This was Del Mar, California, bordering Carmel Valley, California.

Fast forward to the present, and I live in Phoenix, AZ in my mid 20's. You'd think the place I grew up with but in a different city would make little to no difference no?

Yet, every time I come to this particular Red Robin, I get sick afterwards. This last time I went, I made sure to order my burger medium well, and it came out visually well done. Consumed, and a few hours later, felt sick to my stomach.

Don't get me wrong, I want to like this place, and given my years of great experience back at the Red Robin in Del Mar/Carmel Valley, CA, I leaned on the side of 4 stars instead of 3. But I don't know... Maybe it's just the quality of food in AZ?"}
{"text":"Standard American burger joint. Burger selection is a lot. I always get the rings and garlic aioli. Steak fries need some help though."}
{"text":"Good burgers, not too expensive.  Helpful staff, reasonably quick service.  My only negative comment is the noise level.  Its VERY loud in there."}
{"text":"This place sucked our appetizers didn't even come and they gave us the wrong sauces and our food was wrong gave us extra drinks which they should stay on task about this and it wasn't a good experience for me and my family it was truly terrible"}
{"text":"Just walked in waited a few minutes in lobby as there was no host in the lobby, placed order with manager and was told it would be 12 minutes.

30 minutes later I ask in the bar and was rather abruptly told to go to the front waited in the lobby then asked a guy who came to the front and asked about my to go order he said he would check on it comes back with my food and a cup of fries... he said it the food was there waiting but he didn't know I was there???

Burgers were good just no longer hot :/"}
{"text":"This will be the last time my family eats at this location...or perhaps any RR. It took 7.5 minutes to have any wait staff approach us after being seated. When our order was taken, I asked for my burger with an egg over medium and no tomato. It came with a runny egg and tomato. My daughter asked for her burger pink and a side of ranch for her fries. The burger came well done and no side of ranch. Her shake came without the extra silver cup of left over shake that usually comes with the glass. The bartender had to bring it over. When the manager came over to ask for an explanation of our experience, he was kind enough to comp one of our meals. We never saw our waiter again. And just before leaving, the bartender came over to clear our plates and proceeded to tell us our waiter was \"a real nice guy and a single father\". Not the family dining experience (as a single mother) that I expected, to say the least."}
{"text":"We were seated at a table quickly.
We were given a highchair, and I of course, whipped out our daughter's baby wipes, to wipe down the table. (she is teething, so anything she sees, and she's like a bottom fish)

I wish I would have taken a picture, because after I was done wiping, there was my hand print, a dark grey out line on the baby wipe........Are you kidding me?

The girl came around and took our order, we ordered, wedge salad, a prime rib dip, and a burger.

salad came out, it was good. Manager walks around (or at least attempts to) in pretty woman looking boots...Making her rounds, but mostly joking around with staff.

We wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, and wait for our food.

Booties (manager) comes over and asks how we enjoyed our dinner...We then informed her that we hadn't eaten yet.

She goes back and \"checks\". Waitress, and booties (manager) tell us separately that it will be \"one minute\", or that it's \"next up\".

Whatever that means.

Food comes, and it's decent, worth the wait I suppose.

PLEASE, CLEAN YOUR TABLES PROPERLY!"}
{"text":"My husband and I joke that there is a sign on our faces when we come in that says, \"please ignore us.\" It's not just this location either,  the one in Tempe has provided forgetful/nonexistent service the past few times, too. That's frustrating because a soft drink costs nearly $3 here, so something as simple as refills would make me feel like I'm getting more value for a $3 iced down soda.... The bottomless fries are advertised and posted everywhere,  which, again,  makes you feel like you're recovering some value when you pay $12 for a burger. But, alas- the service has been either irritable/snarky when fries and refills are  requested or it's just nonexistent altogether.  Tell me why I'm spending $30 here for 2 people again? In n Out is across the street...

1 star because the burgers and fries really are delicious. No other stars because that testifies to how disappointed I am in what used to be a good, consistent franchise.  Unfortunately our experiences have been such a let down as far as the service is concerned, we'd rather save our $30 and avoid the crying children and just stay away altogether. Maybe we'll sit at the bar if we ever go back... at least someone has to acknowledge you there (hopefully? )."}
{"text":"We just had the pleasure of being served by Maryanne at this Red Robin location. I have never had Red Robin before. Let me say, she really was the perfect server. Friendly, prompt, anticipatory, not too talkative but nice and warm. And she was on top of everything. I will go back to Red Robin because of her. Maryanne is the definition of a
great server"}
{"text":"The place is clean, the atmosphere is nice. But the efficiency lacks really really bad. Example I'm writing this review while I'm waiting for my food. Don't even know how the food is yet still waiting."}
{"text":"-Should have taken it as a sign when we were seated that there were at least six dirty tables in our general area. Lovely to look at stacks of dirty dishes.
-When our appetizer came we had to ask multiple times for silverware. Maybe because there were so many dirty tables there was no clean forks and knives.
-It took some time for our food to arrive and when it did it was not even warm. I guess it was sitting in the window for awhile. We asked the food runner right away for more fries. First attempt. They never came. We told her our issue with the food temperature. No solution given.
-It took even more time for our server to come back and check on us. We told her about our issue and asked for more fries. Second request. No response.
-The hostess actually came over and checked on us and we told her our issue and asked for more fries. Third time was the charm. The fries finally came after we were all done eating.
-Another server came over and spoke to us so we told her what was going on. She gave an excuse that our server had only been with the company for a week. Then why would you give the new server a party of at least 12 sitting by us. 
-After speaking with four employees the manager never came over. They just don't care. Any time I've been to a restaurant with an issue a manager is usually right over to offer a solution. 
-I guess we didn't want dessert because they never asked. Isn't it their job to upset us? The more they sell the more we tip. Hello?
-Complete ruination of my wife's birthday dinner. Totally was not worth the free burger."}
{"text":"Filling up in Scottsdale before heading home to Alpine. Always great chocolate milk shake.  Prime rib French Dip was really good. Stuffed to the max."}
{"text":"Great food and good place to take my 4 year old to. Their ranch dressing and burgers are GOOD!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner after an afternoon of shopping. We asked the hostess if we could sit at the bar and she said we could. However the bar was full. So we asked if she could seat us in the bar area. The hostess was very kind. She tried seating us at a table when one of the servers said, \"that table is dirty, sweetie.\" It was in a very demeaning tone. It was clear the hostess was embarrassed. We sat at a different table. The server came up and tried covering up how rude she was to the hostess. However my friend and I both felt bad. She took our drink orders, returned with them and then took our food order. The food was pretty good. We had no complaints about the food. However our waitress, Janelle, quickly began rushing around. She never asked if we wanted more bottomless fries or another beer for my friend who sat with an empty glass. I would have rated this location higher however the attitude of the server and lack of service is disappointing."}
{"text":"Very friendly when I called to place my order. I called to ask a few questions about there promotions and they kindly answered them. Our food tasted soooo great!"}
{"text":"When we went it was a tad busy, but hey it was the weekend. i for one like this place better then some of the other places. service was ok nothing that really stood out, had to keep telling them every time they refilled my ice tea to NOT put lemon in it, every time it came with lemon. i could be dying of thirst and i wouldnt drink lemon flavored anything but lemonade lol what can i say im picky about my ice tea lol"}
{"text":"So i was given the oppertunity to revisit the location. i did so call around 6:00pm on the weekend.
First the telephone prompt for To-Go orders was answered on the first try (Hooray!) and the lady got my order (exact same meal as my previous post). i was given an estimated time of pickup for 10-15 minutes. The restaruant was very crowded again, and i was left to stand in the bar walkway because there was no other place to stand.

the upside i was greeted right away by the bartender, i believe her name was chelsea. she was very friendly and courteous,i thought all was going to be successful on this visit. but after a few minutes of waiting it ended up turning into a loongg wait. i do not believe it to be her fault, but the kitchens. i am assuming my order was lost in the line up. i believe i ended up waiting a near 20minutes for my food after my 8 minute wait when she went back the first time to pick it up. being that there is no proper place to wait for to go orders (there was another gentleman and his family waiting on the opposite side of the bar entry door) i was essentially in everyones way. i constantly had to shift my position to allow for customers and wait staff to pass through, and a busboy accidently hit into my purse and dropped silverware. my patience was waining fast. being as i had arrived on time. 

chelsea was very attentive though and kept checking back for my meal. i felt bad for her because the expression on my face probably went from being chipper, to just wanting to leave and say forget it. however, eventually i recieved my order. i checked the box right there in the restaruant since i leanred thr last time i should probably do so.

i was happy with what i saw. plenty of golden delicious fries and multiple strips of real bacon on each side. that is why i decied to give 4 stars. the food is wonderful when actually served correctly. it is just the service and time management that leaves me sour."}
{"text":"Came in on New Years day (around 645) with a party of 7, we were seated quickly, however we were given a corner booth, which honestly sucked. There really wasn't a whole lot of room to seat 6 dudes and 1 girl (me) comfortably. (We also gained 1 more further into our stay, which made it more squished) There looked to be tables that could have been put together with a long booth on one side. We would have waited a few more minutes to have been seated comfortably. That is why I am taking a star off. Accurately place your patrons, please. Also some of the locks on the stalls in the bathroom are pretty janky and can be pulled open while it's locked. I think it was the handicap stall, might want to check that out.

Our waitress was awesome. She handled the crazyness of us with ease. I'm sure she was pleased when we left but she never showed it (; I forget her name, I want to say it started with a K, younger blonde.  She brought plenty of refills for the dudes without anyone asking. And for ONCE in my life at a RR location (I frequent RR a lot) my BLT has REAL and MULTIPLE strips of bacon on it!! I didn't have to ASK for real bacon strips. For a 14+$ sandwich I should not be recieving bacon crumbles that are gone within two bites of the sandwich. Kudos to the kitchen. Great job waitress for being very attentive to us and our needs and for putting up with my 'unique' group. Ha ha.

Manager or assistant manager came to our table to check up on us and bring extra fries. Super personable, made jokes and conversation with us
 Great time we had. You had no complaints from 7 S-chassis car owners who came after a car meet. And we can be picky or a handful to an unseasoned wait staff."}
{"text":"I'll never understand why people rate such a major difference among restaurants from the same chain. This Red Robin tastes like any other Red Robin I see. Hell, blindfold me and take me to each Red Robin without me knowing and I still won't know the difference. It's just like movie theaters, they have all the same movies and expensive prices for snacks. The difference that separates each chain restaurant is the service and etc.

This Red Robin's service is inconsistent. Though our servers are always nice, I remember one in particular who just showed no personality or emotions. I felt like I was talking to a wall. She made me feel that I shouldn't even be there and that she shouldn't be there. Otherwise, most servers are courteous. The only issue I have is their inconsistency. They're not as timely as other Red Robins but I would actually blame the fact that there aren't enough waitresses. When I was there, I would only see 3 maybe 4 at most servers working. For a restaurant that has near 100 person capacity, that is slavery."}
{"text":"I really like Red Robin.  I feel it is one of the best places to have a burger. That being said, the last two visits have really lacked in service quality and attention to detail, which is the reason for this review. 

On the previous visit, our server appeared to have 'checked out' and seemed to be in her own world, focused more on her cell phone than her tables. Requests went unmet and we were ignored until it was time for the bill (= tip!)

The most recent visit was via internet ordering and was scheduled for a specific time 30 minutes from placing the order. I arrived 10 minutes early and waited at a podium that has a sign designating it as the place for pick-ups. 8 minutes later I overheard someone say that they were filling P/U orders in the bar so I made my way into the den of drinkers. After waiting for 5 minutes to be acknowledged, it was very difficult to have a conversation because of the loud noise level (duh!). After waiting another 7 minutes, I was told my order was scheduled 12 minutes earlier (even though my email confirmed the correct pick-up time) and the server said they would remake the order (cost of sales a bit high there maybe?). 

If I go back it, will be because of the quality of the food, but absolutely not for the quality of store/employee management."}
{"text":"I used to love Red Robin so much! Haven't been in about 3 years and wasn't impressed tonight. They got our order wrong and my sons burger was still pink...ordered well done. We also had to request a refill on our waters twice. It's Super Bowl Sunday so not a busy night. So not sure if this is something that happens all the time but if I do decide to go back to Red Robin it will be a different location. Even though I can walk to this location from my home. 

Update: came back to RR tonight for my sons bday and still so unimpressed. Food was good but got stale fries and the service was horrible. Tonight we had Kayla. Won't be back regardless if my kids beg or not."}
{"text":"If you are REALLY hungry... I mean like\" I've been stranded in the Desert for 3 days hungry\"... Go here and order THE MONSTER BURGER!!!!! They also have unlimited french fries, if you are into that gluttony sort of deal. They have some neat drinks, wraps, fantastic onion rings, and be sure and get some of that \"Western Sauce\" or whatever it is. This is a bad place for a diet!"}
{"text":"I used to come here for work lunches all the time, but I will never come back to this or any Red Robin. Maybe it's completely freaking irrational of me to say that, but I had a bad experience here and I don't want to take the chance that it might reoccur.

I got one of those burgers with the fried onion strings on it, but on this particular burger it was like they fried a whole onion, without slicing it, and slapped it onto the burger. I bit into it and a huge clump of onions ended up in my mouth. Rather than spitting it out and making a huge ass of myself in a crowded restaurant, I chewed on it for about 10 minutes, trying desperately to mince it into smaller pieces so I could swallow it without choking or gagging, while my girlfriend laughed at me. When I finally forced it down, I was so grossed out I didn't even want the rest of the burger.

You may have a better experience! In fact, you very likely will! But I will Red Robin no more forever."}
{"text":"Always a great place to grab a good burger. Now they have good bottomless garlic Parmesan fries."}
{"text":"The food is great, the servers are quite friendly, but as others have mentioned, the service is extremely slow and poor. We waited at least 15 minutes for our food. Drinks were not automatically refilled and I had to try to \"flag down\" a server, it took a long time before we got drinks. They said bottomless fries and coleslaw, but be prepared to wait a long time to even get a replacement side.

The tablet on the table is sneaky, you might press on a game and there is no confirmation screen. You will be billed for it if you don't look closely.

When you pay with the tablet, it's best to choose the email option if you want your receipt. I chose the printed receipt and after a bit of a wait, nothing came out. I don't want to \"flag down\" another server and wait another lifetime to get my receipt. 

It wasn't very busy, but if you want to come here, perhaps find a less busy time or try your luck at another location."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for a birthday celebration. The place is lively with other parties also here for birthday celebrations. The food came out around the same time and I thought it was pretty good considering we are a party of about 15. The service was cordial but disorganized. Our party of 15 were crammed at a table meant for a smaller party and they told us that once the table next to us clears up, that the table would be combined. Unfortunately, they forgot about it and had another party sit there instead when there are other empty tables. Needless to say, our meal somewhat felt like eating in a crammed bus. Very up close and personal. 

I think the drinks/shakes here are pretty good. I ordered the Hawaiian Hearttrob and enjoyed it. The fries are also decent. But I was really unimpressed by the rest. I ordered the Prime Rib Dip, which was on the dry side. The meat was dry and flavorless. The au jus lacked flavor. The salad and coleslaw were both not fresh. Our server was also disorganized to the end by mixing up our bills. 

Would I come back again? Probably not unless I have to."}
{"text":"So, if you didn't know, Red Robin specializes in gourmet burgers. They have regular burgers, but also have all kinds of choices. I had a mac n cheese burger. It was 2 patties with mac n cheese in between them and lettuce, tomato, and the bun. It was not bad. I like the bottomless steak fries, but can't finish the refill they bring out. Lol. I had the campfire sauce with my fries and it was good. My boyfriend dipped his patty melt in a little bit of campfire sauce. 

We also ended up getting a dessert. The short donut tower. It was tasty. Came out just fried up and had raspberry and a chocolate sauce. 

Staff was friendly and attentive. Manager came by to make sure we enjoyed our dessert and the meal. We would eat here again."}
{"text":"Annnnnd now I remember why it's been a while. 
Horrible service; a table larger than ours was sat at the same time as us and our food came about 15 minutes after there's, which wouldn't be so bad except that half my veggie patty was rock solid and the kids Mac n cheese looked plastic when it arrived(heat lap affects). We weren't checked on for an hour so we couldn't get the refills of fries to at least stuff ourselves with that. I was offered another patty but again, it was already late and honestly it didn't sound too appetizing. Then the final cherry on the poo sandwich; they charged my card twice instead of splitting the check as we asked. I'm a little embarrassed to admit this is a big deal, but, we are a strategic family unit and there is a reason we handle things the way we do. I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"The bottomless fries and bone in wings are the best! As well as the burgers and let's not forget the strawberry lemonade...Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"I had a good experience. We were say quickly, and the young lady who sat us was nice and made small talk. Our server did an amazing job waiting on us. Thanks Jaimie. If you have never been here, it's good burgers and awesome bottomless fries. Red tavern double is very delicious with a great price tag. I also liked the decor with all the fun art."}
{"text":"After leaving my last review and being contacted by Red Robin's customer service (and when I did respond it took them almost two weeks to get back to me), they asked if I still had my receipt. I don't keep burger receipts for two weeks. Then they sent another email thanking me for my input and nothing else. Not even a 10% off coupon for my next dinner or anything to entice me to come back. Massive customer service fail all around."}
{"text":"our group of 7 waited for food and never received some of our food.  what we received was good, but we had to ask multiple times for water, more fries and some of our orders.  was very disappointing as this was not our usual experience."}
{"text":"I am an avid fan of red robin, so what I'm about to say not only shocked me, but shook me to my core. Just walking in, the words \"party of four\" ran through this sesame-seed stricken establishment. We were seated and everything seemed to be going normal... Until a series of unfortunate events swooped down upon this restaurant. To start, a beloved member of my group was omitted French fries for what seemed to be an eternity. Not only is this a ruthless and condescending act on mankind, but this member was not just any member. She was also pregnant. In due time, her fries, as well as her husband's drink was given to us but the apologies that met our ears were nothing compared to what was about to occur. When the rest of our food came out, we had no knives to cut with. No forks to fork with. All along this terrible adventure of a ride, our cups were left empty along with our hearts. When I left this restaurant, which has the front door open right to bell road, I wanted to just keep walking so a car would hit me. Does living in a civil society mean anything to anyone anymore? I'll let you be the judge of that."}
{"text":"Great restraunt but... Every visit.. They forget intems... Take for ever... Rude. Bar is slow. Cooks not doing their jobs!"}
{"text":"I had family visiting from out of state. They never ate at red robin. I told them how great this place was. There were 9 of us. My bill was over $200. I never had so many clusters happen in one place. Service horrible. Food even worse. Uncooked vegetables in the soup. Nothing was bottomless.  Half of the people got to eat first. It was my worst experience in a restaurant. They comped me for 2 meals. Aren't they special. They can keep their comp, food,  and anything else they have to offer. Horrible."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in my visit to Red Robin. For starters, I ordered a side salad with my meal that came out on a plate with my sandwich. I always thought salads came out before the meal and on a separate plate, but maybe I'm wrong. The salad included dry Iceberg lettuce that tasted like it had been sitting out, not to mention the portion wasn't even big enough to call it a side salad. It also came out without dressing on it. Secondly, my sandwich was falsely advertised as having avocado on it when it ended being only 1 small slice. Thirdly, the bottomless fries were not bottomless. The server checked on us about 15 min after we got our food, and when we were finally able to order more fries he said it would be 5 more minutes. I also received zero refills on my water, and the server left our plates sitting there well after we were finished eating. I'm only giving this 2 stars because our server was at least friendly. The food and service this go around have steered me away from Red Robin for a while."}
{"text":"We usually hit this spot because its easy and you know what you came here for. Had lunch here with the family on Saturday. The server was great, but the food came out kind of cold and the burger was not great. I don't think Ill be coming to Red Robin for a while."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Hawai'i and the kids wanted to eat at Red Robin. Our last night with our family we decided to have dinner here. A table of hungry 13 family members, we sat in Tony's section. He was very attentive, our drinks were refilled automatically and he was a great waiter! Thank You Tony for making our family feel welcomed even with 13 of us. The food was spectacular! The best onion rings and the best burgers."}
{"text":"Curiosity got the better of me, so I decided to give Red Robin a try. While the Mushroom & Swiss burger and garlic fries I ordered weren't bad, they certainly weren't very good either. The patty had very little flavor and the steak fries had only a hint of garlic flavor (the shaved parmesan was a nice touch, though). The service? The server was pleasant enough, but did not check once to see if I needed any refills (aren't the fries supposed to be bottomless?) or even to see if I was enjoying the food. Honestly, there are several places in the C-U that offer better burgers and fries and are comparable in price or less. Overall, not a bad experience, but not one that makes me want to go back."}
{"text":"To go orders of soup. Not even 3/4 of the way full! Both were supposed to be Clam Chowder. What a joke. I will not be ordering to go, from the bar again. I recommend dinning in or not going at all..."}
{"text":"Stopped at two different locations in Gilbert, the burger was ordered medium and it was well done dry.. I wanted grilled onions on it... It was the size of a slice of pickle... Fries were good tho
Tried another location for a grilled chicken sandwich.. Without the special sauce.. The girl didn't write anything down.. It came to me with sauce.. I complained, she took it back, they scraped of the sauce and added my mayo and 1 leaf of lettuce... It was terrible
Val vista and the 60.... 
I talked to the manager, he said they did have a few complaints... She was not to kind...
I never complain.. This was a month ago, I'm still pissed"}
{"text":"An awesome burger chain originally from the great Northwest that keeps popping up everywhere.  I used to go to this place a lot back in the 80's when I was a kid.   The place always had the coolest arcade games back in the day.  Mountain High Mudd Pie has to be seen (and eaten) to believe.  To say the thing is big is an understatement.  Absolut Lemonade is a pretty good drink.    Fries and most non-alcoholic drinks are bottomless.  Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Burger is an epic win."}
{"text":"Service was great. The God was good. We were the first people in the door and it got very busy in a matter of a few minutes. I expect the busyness to diminish somewhat overtime and the staff will perfect their skills."}
{"text":"I was pretty frustrated. The food was extremely cold, even though we showed up 5 minutes early to the pick up time of 9:33pm. We had ordered online and was able to go ahead and navigate pretty easily, giving us the option is to go ahead and customize our order as if we were in the restaurant - which was great.However when we received our order nothing was as if it was requested when the meat needed to be pink it was dry, we ordered extra fries and we got a meal with no fry's... Normally we love the shakes BUT beware of the S'mores milkshake... not the best out of the bunch. The big problem was after we got home and realize that we also found out that our donuts did not have the berry sauce which was a huge bummer... And then I spent 25 minutes on hold when I called into the store to go ahead and have them fix the order so I could drive down there and nobody got back on the line... It was pretty busy there but this was seriously online crossed."}
{"text":"Red Robin is generally a good place to get a burger, fries and shake. They have excellent onion rings, which is my favorite appetizer to get. The service is usually really good and the burgers are mighty tasty. I enjoy eating here as does my family. I have never had bad service or a bad burger. 

For a chain restaurant they do have great burgers and an excellent selection of them. I like their protein burger and that it comes with a salad instead of fries. Tragically it doesn't come with unlimited salad. I am also a huge fan of their bacon chesseburger. Their Royal red robin is fantastic, but afterwards I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. They still have unlimited fries. It's a more upscale Fuddruckers with better burgers.

I've never sat at the bar so I can't comment on that. However, everywhere else is very family friendly. I enjoy when the wait staff gets together to sing a birthday song. It always makes me think of Waiting, hopefully I never get the dreaded THUMBS DOWN at any restaurant I eat at.

All in all its a sit down chain burger joint. You get what you expect, good burgers friendly wait staff, nothing AMAZING but still worth your money and time. It's also conveniently located to where I live."}
{"text":"What's there to like about this place? I can't think of one. I wish I could give this place ZERO stars.

Slow service, never get refills - you have to get the server's attention for that - most of the times they are missing silverware and you have to ask for that too.

Just today was there with co-workers and my cobb salad came with no egg (what kind of cobb salad comes without hard boiled eggs?) and my friend had to call the server and ask for a refill of his drink and for more fries. I was never even asked if I wanted a refill. Previously, at this same location, burgers have come without dressing, or not per request - so this isn't a one off experience. We go out as a team here once every couple of months. 

In spite of all the poor service and food, you are now \"shamed\" into tipping 20% with their new electronic self-pay device on each table - and you get to do all the work.

I don't think we will be going back here for a while, I am tired of racking up $80 bills for four people with poor service and sub-standard food.

I might as well take the business elsewhere - they really don't care and have enough traffic coming through at this location to not need to care anyway."}
{"text":"first timer, went on free bday club burger.  very cute layout, seated right away and had good server.  Appetizer was pretzel bites-the cheese dip was amazing, could of eaten it with a spoon, pretzel bites themself were similar to those I buy frozen and cook in oven, but together good.  Ordered burger to split with daughter-it came out split for us on two plates-cooked to order, was impressed with that.  The ending was bad, ordered the donut tower-it was sprinkled with SALT instead of sugar-made us sick, just a bite killed our stomachs as it was so salty.  They removed it from our bill and came out with another but we were ruined, had bad stomachs rest of day-assumed from salt overload.  Server apologized-said they do that all that time and said manager would come out to speak with new dessert-he delivered it and left, not a word.  We did not eat it-couldn't, but could see it was sugar this time.  The free bday burger idea is good as the prices were around $10 each.  Not the best first time experience, might try again, unsure."}
{"text":"I came in on my lunch from work at 12:58 on a Monday. I stood at the front to be seated for 5 minutes without one single person feeling like they should do a thing. Multiple wait staff looked at me and did nothing, including two that stood at the end of the bar conversing. Thank you for helping me waste valuable minutes I had away from work. I have never been so humiliated at a restaurant. 

It will be the last time this one gets the chance to do so again. I will never go to any Red Robin anywhere. Congratulations for giving as awful a customer experience as you could."}
{"text":"I've been a red robin cluxks and fries fan for a very long time, this being said, when my way over cooked cluxks showed up I immediately knew. The manager said that's how they are and offered to bring me some more.... They never showed up! Also, red robin used to be the place for \"families\" now, not so much. They've taken a turn for the worse in my opinion. Still friendly, still bottomless fries, still probably the last time I'll come to this one again...until the kids request it!"}
{"text":"I came here last week and the food was good (chicken wings) but the service was horrible.  Decided to give it another chance tonight.  This time the service was just as bad and the wings were burnt to a crisp."}
{"text":"The food is very good, the black and Bleu is one of favorites. Its  juciey tasty treat. The barely batter broccilli is yummy as well. 

Preivously i review this location and it was only so so. But the last servral times the service has been great and my other concerns appear to have been address."}
{"text":"Service from Kyle and Tony was phenomenally superb. Great food. Unreal selection of sauces for BOTTOMLESS fries. Guys these deals are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! overall 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place! The turkey burger is amazing and it looks like a turkey breast and not a turkey burger that you see in the store....it's so tasty and juicy that it's making my mouth water as I write this...I usually order the bacon cheeseburger and substitute the turkey burger and I'm never disappointed the toppings are fresh and the fries wow crispy, seasoned and golden brown just like the way I like an order of bottomless fries...wish I would have started going here sooner...I've had the burgers and they are flavorful and seasoned with a delicious seasoning that they provide and the buns are so fresh that they melt in your mouth...I also love the camp fire bbq sauce it's out of this world especially when you dip your fries in it or even order it on the burger...I suggest you get a burger here because you can't go wrong especially when it's their specialty!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Waiter was incompetent. No refills. Waited 40 minutes to get food. Did not give us silverware or napkins, had to ask for them after food came. Only gave 2 stars because food was good."}
{"text":"The red royal burger is the best! Fried egg with bacon cheese burger Yes please! Service is always quick and attentive. One time we had to catch a movie, the waiter whipped out our food so quick that we were literally only spent the total of 30 mins in the restaurant. Great job!

Ask for a rewards card. Every 8 burgers you buy get the 9th one for free. Also a free burger on your birthday month."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch.  Nice folks.  Good service. I eat at the bar so I can watch sports.  BUT went once at night and discovered they have excellent and cheap Manhattans and Martinis!!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here occasionally for a good burger. For me the burgers have been really yummy every time I visited. I like that there are lots of different options, however I always end up getting the royal or banzai. I'm not sure that the burgers are exactly worth the $10+ but I've never been disappointed with the taste of the food. One complaint I have about my last visit was the burger I got had bacon listed as a topping. Usually when you see this you'd think you'd at least get 2 or 3 pieces, however my burger only had one tiny piece of bacon on it and barely any lettuce, but I didn't complain because I was hungry and it still tasted great. 

I'd also like to say service is hit or miss here. Sometimes it's really great, other times it takes a really long time for servers to return to refill your drink or bring your bill or what have you. I also find it really weird how there always seems to be a ten minute wait for a seat even when the majority of tables are empty. I'm guessing they are understaffed.

I'll keep coming back because I love the burgers!"}
{"text":"The food was great!!! The only thing was our server Lachelle. She barely checked on our table, or asked if we needed more fries or drinks, I guess she wasn't use to handling a big table. Over all a great place to eat at"}
{"text":"Okay, lets start with when I first walked in. I ate here yesterday morning, I walked in a couple minutes after they had opened at 11;00 am. I was greeted by a real grumpy dirty blonde haired girl that was not very friendly at all.....really at 11:00 am when they first open and already grumpy. Not how I like to be treated.  I have been going to red robin for the last 10+ years and was so excited when they opened this location. What I have noticed is that it keeps getting worse each time we come here. My family and I frequent this place less and less as the years go by. We try to think positive and try to give it another try to no avail that things are getting better because they are not. I was seated right away in the bar area in the very first both.I had a nice server who was also the bartender. What I ordered was the Hunk a burnin' love burger with the burger which I asked to be cooked med well. The burger was so mushy but I swallowed it down without complaining because I was so darn hungry. Oh and by the way the quality of the burgers has declined quite a bit and burgers are all now preformed to be a perfect circle. Me no like as they must be frozen and grilled that way. Huh.  I asked to get the spicy catsup and was given one tiny container full for two rounds of fries that I had ordered which was definetly not enough. I waited to see if they would offer me more and that never happened. I saw a little short guy go by which I am going to say was the manager in a light blue shirt. Passed me by not once,not twice not even three times but four times without asking me how things were going or how my meal was. This place is lacking of good management and service along with food quality. This is my last time going to this location as well as going to any other location. They have also gone more to bar type food and atmosphere. No longer a family establishment. So long Red Robin.
GO ELSEWHERE FOLKS....THERE'S A LOT MORE CHOICES WITH BETTER BURGERS AND PRICES.
Try Fuddruckers at SS Springs mall."}
{"text":"I went at a time where there wouldn't be so many people that and I would be served quickly and professionally, this wasn't the case. While I was served in a timely manner, once the food had come to us, it seemed like our waitress had disappeared. She took over twenty minutes to come back around to refill our drinks and take the empty plates from our table. The food was delicious though and the shake that I got was definitely worth the money. Overall, the experience was above average and I would definitely recommend going to this Red Robins and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I guess you can't really go wrong with a Red Robin... It's colorful, clean, food is good, lively atmosphere, etc. This place was PACKED on a Sunday afternoon, something I wouldn't have expected. But, service was great, and food was... Well, it's Red Robin. That isn't necessarily a complaint, it's just that it's not that special. Good, yes, special, no."}
{"text":"YEAH! When you have some serious munchies, this is a great place to overindulge! Ahhh YES... The MONSTER BURGER! Tackle that sucker and you're a champion in my book! The \"Onion Ring Tree\" is a novel idea as well, albeit a tad expensive for what it is. Dig the groovy flavored ice teas as well, free refills. Yummy! Side of ranch, extra ketchup... Let's Rock & Roll!"}
{"text":"Super nice location, very nicely decorated, as compared to other locations that seem overly cluttered. Food was good, service was excellent, great experience overall. When you are super hungry for a burger, this is the place to be. Added bonus, we were here on a Saturday, and there were plenty of TV's for watching football games. I really wouldn't think of going here to crack back a few brews and watch a game, but I would NOW!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a dinner out at the Waterfront Red Robin. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger which was okay, not great. What I really found disappointing was the chicken tortilla soup.  It seems that at a restaurant that has this soup is either really good or really bad. There is no in between. 

The service was great and the atmosphere was fun. I would very likely return to this Red Robin."}
{"text":"My husband is a burger guy and despite our last two awful experiences at this location he talked me into giving in one last try. It's been two years since our last visit so I was hoping it had improved (couldn't get much worse), but boy was I wrong. Went there today (Thur about 1pm). 20 min later the waiter took our drink order. We ordered an appetizer which never did arrive even after we reminded our server. Our 20 mo old was getting fussy so we asked for a small plate of French fries, which also, never arrived. 40 min later our food arrived and once again, just like before, it was COLD. I ordered a hot prime rib sandwich. Ridic! My daughters grilled cheese was blah with unmelted cheese, fries were cold, and my entree was missing the coleslaw. I politely requested it again, but it too was elusive. They took my sandwich back to the kitchen and nuked it. Seriously I cannot say one good thing about the quality of the food or service. Truth is, I will tolerate sub par service for a good meal, but everything from the iced tea to my stale bread and the undercooked and tasteless steak fries was beyond disappointing. Our toddler even refused the fries and he eats everything!! We spoke with manager after paying and she offered a comp. Umm no thanks but greatly appreciate the gesture. The mgr was a sweetheart and admitted our server was normally a bus boy but they got so busy they had to have him serve. A scheduling problem maybe? Anyway it just couldn't make up for the awful food. I would avoid this RR. We can't make sense of the good reviews. Only thing I can think of is its young people who are happy to get a meal from somewhere other than Wendy's. Personally, I'd rather have Wendy's."}
{"text":"A little noisy and very packed. Server was a little slow to greeting us, but after that it was great. I can do without the loud birthday songs. They're obnoxious and completely unnecessary these days. Three birthday songs in one meal really brought the experience down from perfect to near perfect. Red Robin should reconsider doing this dated old tradition. Dorky family members will be disappointed, but the rest of us will not miss this loud spectacle.

Excellent food and the fries cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequently come here for their awesome steak fries and garden burgers. Wait time is rarely long and today was no exception. We were supposed to wait 15-20 minutes, but ended up only waiting 5 minutes. Our server, Courtney, was friendly, accommodating and quick. She seemed to know that we were ready to order as soon as she approached us. So rather than waste time with drink orders alone she put in our food order too. Excellent place!"}
{"text":"Great place for families with young kids. Gotta say that yummmm is not a word I would use to describe it. The word would be food.....average food.

Don't get me wrong, I would go again because I have kids. Just would not go if it was just is adults."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have about Red Robin is the prices.  I mean, for my husband, my toddler and me it cost $40+ for lunch. That is ridiculous, especially for some burgers and chicken sandwiches. I honestly don't know how they stay in business. There are always families and kids in there. But if you charge $10+ for a burger and fries, I guess you'll have great profit. We probably will never go back."}
{"text":"Not a first time customer ro Red Robin but I  am to this store. Not too bad festive and lively atmosphere.  We entered and were sat at a table right away. They took our drink order and after that server came every few minutes to see if we're ready to order. 

Placed order and sat. Food comes and we dive in. Now they offer bottomless fries but I  think. Why not give fries before meal gets there? Food arrives burgers are decent and the fries they deliver were sparse.  

Ate half my burger and all my fries. Never saw our server. 20 minutes goes by still sitting and waiting hostess comes by asks if we need anything and we ask for more fries. Shortly thereafter she comes back and apologizes for the wait. 

Eat my fries and i want more so i wait and wait and wait some more. Please note the dining area is thinning out. 

Server comes around asks if i need my drink refilled and I say no because it's still almist full. I ask for more fries. I get this feeling hes tired because he stands there looking at me then says he'll be back I sit and wait and wait and wait. Then some guy with a tray walks by with fries. He stops at our table, walks away then comes back minutes later. He just puts the fries on the table and doesn't say a word.  

I like Red Robin but this store needs to do something to win me over. I'm in the service industry and i have experienced better."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is decent. I just don't like that they don't clean the tables when people leave. We sat next to an unclean table and have been here about an hour still not clean. Two other tables in front of us left and their dishes are still there."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong at Red Robin.  I mean how could you?  There's bottomless fries, either steak fries or sweet potato fries.  And also mouth watering burgers. Have been to multiple locations around the valley and the service is always great and never a long waiting time.  If you're in a crunch for time you can also call ahead and order your food and it will be ready by the time you are seated at your table.  I would recommend this if you have a shorter lunch break.  My favorites items are the Whiskey River Burger, Whiskey River Chicken Sandwich and Whiskey River Chicken Wrap.  I guess I'm a big fan of their BBQ sauce.  Not to mention they have the best ranch amongst all restaurants. Lastly, I recommend the berry lemonade to compliment the food.  This is also bottomless so drink up and get one to go!"}
{"text":"Mediocre service. Waited 45 for COLD food as in it seems like it was sitting for 15 minutes before we got it. Probably won't be back. Not very impressed."}
{"text":"Not at the top of my list anymore! Ordered the royal burger, when the burger came the egg was still runny in spots. A server came by and told me that that is how they cook them now. It will be a long time before i go back to any red robin. never saw a manager, never got refills on the drinks, had to ask for everything we wanted, ex. extra napkins. POOR SERVICE. POOR FOOD."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. Busy area being near the mall so expect a wait if your in a group. Bar had room though so I squeezed in. Parking was a bit cramped even for the space they have. Bar tender got to me quick too"}
{"text":"Location is easy to get to right off the belt line. I come in mostly for the Banzai burger with pepper jack cheese and it never disappoints. Bar tenders are friendly, no problems with staff. Parking isn't a problem being next to a supermarket. Bathrooms are respectable as well but only one paper dispenser - pray it doesn't go bad. All in all a good experience. Limitless fries too!"}
{"text":"Pretty good service here with friendly staff. Food is always and cooked just like the way you ordered."}
{"text":"Im a single 69year old senior out for an early dinner and my once a month beer. Stopped in around 4ish and was almost immediately seated. As always the Robin is fairly busy, being Saturday, but my server was right there. A young man named Mike , trying to grow a goatee and sporting a man bun, made me feel right at home. I asked for a beer closest to a Heffewiessen and he suggest Blue Label-Right on. Im a sucker for their Fried Clams and this time I also ordered fried zucchini and jalapeño chips with a garlic aeyoli (sp) . Everything came perfect-Nothing dried or overcooked with the steak fries having the right amount of outer crispness and a softer nicely cooked interior.  

I need to say thanks to the group of young people who helped me up after taking a tumble outside. My balance is a little off since a stroke 8 years ago and was almost to my car when I went down.  Was having difficulty getting up when a young lady offer help and called over to her friends. Got me to my feet and made sure I was okay- I'de like them to know that this old man feels a helleva lot better knowing here are young people like them around."}
{"text":"Insisted that the husband and I eat here after watching incessant commercials. Burgers were decent, but everything is an up charge, waiters are pushy and annoying. The waiter acted like he was selling me a used pinto with one owner. I just wanted a burger and ended up with apps I didn't want and sides that were all extra. If Friday's and a cheap tablet had a baby it would be red robin. We had to order our own apps and check ourselves out with a tablet placed on the table. Why not cook the food ourselves and bus our own tables. The bill was $50 for basically two burgers a beer/ iced tea. I will prob never go back."}
{"text":"Service = great. Food = alright. 

I've been here a few times over the years. For a cheesy chain it's ok. Nothing amazing. But the endless fries and drinks are a pretty cool feature."}
{"text":"The food here is always great and comes out quick. This time I got a strawberry shake that went well with my appetizer. The service was nice and prompt will be back again!"}
{"text":"Total disaster from start to finish. We went in New Years about 6:30 or so. We were told there would be a 10 min wait. it was 30 min, and when we were seated there were at least 8 empty tables. Service was seriously lacking, servers and even the manager were sliding their butts on the back of our chairs because they were to lazy to walk around, lifting large trays over as they slid through. The food took way longer than it should have and was cold when it arrived. My little girl wanted some more fires, after waiting more than 20 min for a refill, were told it was going to be a while because they had to fill orders before they could refill my daughters fries. The restroom was discusting, there were towels on the floor and two of three stalls had no toilet paper. I've had better experiences at McDonald's, we couldn't have had a worse first meal of the year. Needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This review is for the bartender. Red robin has good food, no big deal. With a chain company, we know what food to expect, it's the customer service that makes us decide to come back. First, the host, an adorable little blond girl, was super sweet. When another person forgot my fries, she was all over making it it right. I'm allergic to citric acid, and Kati is one of the few who knew what that meant. She forgot to request no salsa on my burger (tomatoes=citric acid) but this doesn't make me think any less of her. She immediately took accountability for forgetting and got me a new burger, even though I forgot to request no salsa. Then, there was a hair in my food. But the manager immediately took care of that too. So mind you, my experience didn't go smoothly but it was handled perfectly. They were crazy busy and Kati was the only bar tender for the entire restaurant and she owned it. Response, fast, and still kept up with her own tables. People don't appreciate people like her as much as they should!"}
{"text":"their food is great... but the fries weren't hot... I want fresh fries all the time ."}
{"text":"OK so the fried mushrooms are absolutely fantastic! I like mushrooms alot. They actually use a batter that doesn't have beer in it! AWESOME! When the all you can eat steak fries are HOT they are very YUMMY. I get the red robin gourmet cheesburger with provalone and no red pickle relish... and the french onion soup always hits the spot.  The freckled lemonade is always refreshing."}
{"text":"Jordan was so pleasant and had superb mannerism. He made us feel like very special burger lovers.  Thanks Jordan, we will return."}
{"text":"This visit we got our food to go. We came home and there was no ranch with our order even though the lady told us she put it in there. We got a salad so this is why we would need to ranch. Then we also got a bacon cheese burger after 2 bites I bite down on a black crunchy piece of something from the grill. So I guess they didn't think to clean the grill before cooking my burger. So we paid all this money for food that we didn't end up eating and since it was to go we couldn't just grab a waiter and send it back."}
{"text":"Our server served us until we were almost done eating and left us sitting there waiting for the check for a good 10 minutes.. I had to stop another server for our check, our server never returned to thank us or say bye we just paid with the ziosk and left ): food was great ! Service not so much"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last 10 days (solo after a day of golf and last night with the Mrs. 
Pros: 
Service: Both visits the service was great. First was a gentleman that was the perfect mix of attentive yet distant. Last night (Jasmine) was similar. She was very friendly and helpful. My wife is a...complex woman that could wear down a waitress that is not a professional. Jasmine was continually pleasant and responsive.

Food: This is a chain restaurant so you know what you're going to get. I come here when I was burgers that are a few notches above fast food and a perfectly cold Blue Moon. I tried the \"Love\" burger that is apparently only available a limited time. It was very good. I would have liked more of the sauce they put on it, but great just the same. 

I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Since when can a person not order a side of fries without a food order... What kind of restaurant would do that especially one that is \"kid\" friendly. Unheard of. If it wouldn't have been for the amount of people in our group i would have walked out. Highly doubt i will ever return. Never have i had to request multiple times for fries let alone be told no you have to order food first. Not a good \"company\" policy.... hopefully the idiot that made this a rule wakes up..."}
{"text":"I don't know what they have against seating me in the dining room but every time I come here they seat me in the bar. Don't get me wrong I definitely enjoy a good drink but the bar tends to be louder with less privacy. I go to restaurants to have good food and enjoy the company of the people I am with... not to hang out in a bar. That being said the food is amazing so I rated them four stars because of their food."}
{"text":"On this visit, we were going so that David could get his free birthday burger.  The service on this visit was the worst we've ever experienced here.

Usually, this location of RR is fast, friendly and effecient. However, today they seemed to be understaffed and overwelmed.  

When they brought our plates out, there were no fries on them.  We had finished almost half of our sandwiches before the fries finally made it out.   However, whent they finally appeared, the fries were fresh and hot... and my chicken teriakyi sandwhich (with lettuce, tomato, grilled pineapple and swiss cheese) was good. 

A couple of negatives about the place, they have several tiny two seater booths that just do not have enough table space. Also, I wish they would serve the sandwiches on a plate rather than in the baskets that they normally use.  

The place is very family-friendly and normally a good place to visit for a fast casual meal."}
{"text":"My kids and I love coming to Red Robin! Beer is cold, burgers are great and the refills on the kids meals is awesome! It's worth the $40 every time we come. Service is quick and friendly, always makes for an enjoyable experience! We usually get in an out of here in about 30-45 minutes, so it's not a long drawn out process. Food comes out quick and hot!"}
{"text":"Ok so hit the wrong button on my last review and posted to soon. 

We sat down and looked at two tables that were dirty for entire meal. Then we got out"}
{"text":"I like Red Robin. It's a chain. I know. It's industrial food. I know. But it's my gold standard for burgers. My first experience with Red Robin was the original Anchorage location at the Northway Mall. A beacon of light, warmth and burgers in the great white north. Now sadly closed, as well I understand, the original location near U-Dub (no, not Wyoming)."}
{"text":"Red Robin is underrated. Great burgers. Good beer too.  At this particular location the service is hit and miss.  Understaffed.  All in all I like the place.   Just wish they would get a little more organized."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! Staff was very friendly and accommodating. The one thing that threw me off was how everything is going digital. At this location (and I am assuming that more locations are doing this), there is no physical menus and everything from ordering and paying is done via a tablet. Luckily, I had my debit card handy."}
{"text":"It's a good burger. Good fries, and onion rings. Service was fast and friendly. I was disappointed with the milk shake but that's not a deal breaker. I would happily return and try different items for an easy quick meal. 

I was most impressed with how friendly and fast they were on a very busy Friday evening."}
{"text":"I've waited to post a review to give red robin a chance.  Sometimes there are circumstances that we the consumer don't see.... With that said my 3rd time getting take out & all 3 times a fail!! Ordered a royal burger as I do each time... Cheat meal! First time I asked for no tomato & med well. Well let's say bloody burger went in the trash! 2nd time I added spinach artichoke dip.  Literally the dip had maybe 2 Tbs in the giant cup it was put in, embarrassing that they were OK with that.  Tonight .. Craving a burger, get my usual... But instead got a hockey puck that was missing part of the patty bun was mushy ... So bad!!! Won't go back EVER!! #livedownthestreettoo"}
{"text":"terrible!!!  they forgot my order like really?!?! .............. not cool.  I ordered online like last time - which turned out great. But this second time not acceptable. It wasn't even that complicated of an order.  They just chose to ignore my order.  So disappointed"}
{"text":"This place provided the worse service i have experienced in years. Music was loud to the point of distraction. Four dollars for strawberry lemonade would not be silly if they served more than five ounces with very few refills. They advertise all you can eat french fries but since you will never see your server that is simply false advertising. Food was cold probably because our server could not be bothered to bring food. If you like over priced food and completely indifferent service this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The burgers here are great, they offer a variety of options, and each comes with bottomless fries! We came on a Saturday night, so it was pretty crowded and there was a decent wait. But my friend and I found seats at the bar no problem. I took a risk from my typical order and got the Burning Love Burger, a spicy jalapeno flavored cheeseburger with chipotle mayo, and was glad I did. The burger had a nice kick with the fried jalapeno slices and pepper jack cheese, but not too overwhelming. Service while sitting at the bar was not as attentive as a sit down table would be; however, we were checked in on enough to get a second round of fries. Make sure to sign up for their email list, you will receive a free burger on your birthday!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Went with a $14 premium burger. (It was some bacon cheddar burger)  Nothing premium about it.  They did a great job on menu making it sound great but it underwhelmed.  Endless fries is cool but how about seasoning them? I Like the auto pay at table but did feel ripped off.  It's a shame to get one night out a month and not that we had high expectations but it was so disapointing.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I felt like I was sitting through 'Shenaniganz' because my experience was hilarious. The waitress was super friendly (not a bad thing or anything), but  overly hyper and excited, I starting to wonder if she worked for corporate or something. 

So I couldn't decide if I wanted a Red Robin gourmet burger or the new spicy Jalepeno burger...the waitress comes to take the order and I ask her which one she likes better. She said that she liked the Jalepeno one better because the last time she tried it, she \"had an orgasm in her mouth\", no joke, exactly what she said. Hubs and I were trying so hard not to laugh...as she disappeared in the back after our order, I could only think of a million things I could have said. I was dying with laughter.  Kris said, \"that was kind of innappropriate, but funny\". 

Was the burger really THAT good? haha...

It was pretty good, it was a nice mix of  jalepeno poppers, monterey jack cheese, plenty of meat, tomatos and cajun sauce. And the bottomless fries are great. Just not orgasmic great. : )

The service was a little out there, I kind of felt we were dining at a strip joint, but I held my tongue. Food makes up for it big time."}
{"text":"Took my son here after our Boy Scout hike this past Sunday. He is almost 15 and the service we had was over the top great. My son said and I agreed that this was the best service the he has ever seen at a restaurant. Allie was extremely attentive and just as something was close to finished a refill or the next item was hitting the table. You can be sure that next time Allie will be requested. Wish she could train all restaurant servers to be similar. Thank you and keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This location we always have great service. They always remind us regards to the rewards card we have and the deals we have to choose from. The Teriyaki Chicken Burger and fries with Teriyaki sauce to dip is always juicy and perfect. Who would have thought of using a beer in a milkshake? They did and the Blue Moon one is awesome. Got to try it. Would always be back"}
{"text":"Showed yesterday at 4:30pm the place was dead and they sat us in the bar area. Both myself and my buddy are recovering alcoholics. We asked to move and she told us they didn't have room anywhere else.... she offered us alcohol 5 or 6 times I secretly think she wanted to drink. I eat here 4 times a year but every time I'm here I feel like there are 20 new items and whatever I liked last time is gone. Now they charge for sauce for your fries? 75 cents?!? You know Ketchup is free right? Not a great idea to charge for something simple when every other option gives away free food.... anyways we won't be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner at Red Robin for the most part. This location is definitely smaller than others, or maybe it just feels cramped because the tables are all very close together. I was seated in the front room & luckily I came when it wasn't very busy, but every time someone opened the door I was freezing. Also, I constantly needed a refill! The food was pretty good, and the service was definitely above average but they were obviously extremely overstaffed."}
{"text":"I like this particular location. Close to the house. Always consistently good. Sign up and you get a free burger for B-day. Nice place to bring the kids. Can get a little noisy. Servers are always friendly and the food comes out rather fast. They also have chicken and fish on the menu. This is not a high end restaurant yet it is fun and tasty. Ask for their some of their different custom dipping sauces to jazz things up a bit."}
{"text":"Prices are absurd. For a burger. For $15 you bet your butt I can find a better burger in town. Service is typically nice but they're also very inconsistent in regards to speed. You could wait days for some drinks, or, it could be real nice a quick.

We don't come here often, when we do, it's because we were gifted a gift card."}
{"text":"Service varies... There's no consistency at this location, but the bar staff are friendly.  The hostess (I was there saturday night12/20/14) was somewhat cold and dismissive.  She didn't smile or greet me (I was still waiting on my husband) friendly but as she walked the other guests by she had a whole different game face on and even small talked with them.  So clearly, I feel a bit insulted.  Anyways,  the atmosphere here is good, food is okay; I had better at other Red Robins.  Beer is nice and cold, and is a good location for shoppers and/or locals."}
{"text":"Came in to pick up a big to go order, everything was correct! Got I would say nine meals? Was packaged up well, had utensils, and everything tasted great! 

Super short review, but they did a great job with the order! Friendly staff as well, hopefully they're as nice when you come in to dine!"}
{"text":"We come often because of the gluten free options.  We have eaten there several times and never gotten sick.  It is for sure the family favorite and I find the staff here a bit better than some of the other locations."}
{"text":"We rolled in an hour before close, which we usually don't do, but we'd just picked somebody up from the airport and they were hungry. The waitress was very pleasant and quick with drinks and fries. And she brought enough ranch for the entire table. The burger was on par with 5 Guys or Smashburger. It's nice they have the GF bun and dedicated to fryer. Renovation is nicely done but I miss the claw machine."}
{"text":"Not happy with this location.... server was awesome but the hostess wanted to seat us at a dirty table. We ordered burgers with fruit on the side, however it was canned fruit and who knows what else is in it. 
I like the Red Robin name but not this location... we usually go to the one at San tan."}
{"text":"So my husband and I last minute went to Red Robin. It was near closing but they still sat us. Our server Eugene was awesome. He wasn't rushing or trying to hurry us out. Never have us an attitude and refilled our drinks without us asking. Our food came out fast which was probably due to the kitchen closing but it was still a great experience. Thank you Eugene!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Try the Whiskey River Barbecue Burger."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service ! We usually sit at the bar, all the bartenders we've had are friendly and provide good service . We even showed up 20 min before closing last year on Fourth of July and the bartender was cool about seating us , and letting us enjoy a few beers. 
Ps
Try the bleu ribbon burger, my favorite !"}
{"text":"The moment we arrived we were warmly greeted by a very friendly Krista. She showed us to a table and then suggested another one that she felt would be more comfortable. I thought that was cool. 
Our server (Lela) was also friendly and attentive. She smiled often and kept our glasses full. 
My Atlantic cod sandwich was delicious! Nuff said. 
Never had a bad night at this location. Being a rewards member is free and it pays off!"}
{"text":"Not the best location. The service is friendly, but disorganized. I think we had three or four servers take our order, and the final order was still wrong. We were one of maybe three couples on a Sunday afternoon, so I know it wasn't because it wasn't to busy. 

Despite the service, it's still \"Red Robin\". So, it's a safe place to get decent food. You know what you are getting."}
{"text":"I mean, don't we all know what we are getting ourselves into when we go to Red Robin? Once you've been to one, you've been to them all. Isn't that the whole point of branding? This locations is the same old, same old. Nothing wildly unique, decent food, decent prices, decent service. If you are in the mood for a Red Robin burger, this an average location."}
{"text":"If I had to rate this place on food I would have given it two stars because the burgers were just ok, nothing like I expected from a place who specializes in just burgers supposedly.  The reason for the one star rating was this place had the WORSE staff I have ever experienced, including the disorganized kitchen staff, the so called waitress and the manager - all completely unacceptable to be working in this industry.  This place promote the heck out of the fact that they offer you unlimited french fries and yet when I ordered a second order, they never arrived at the table and when I could find my waitress (she checked on us once when our food was delivered to our table and never again) I asked her to cancel the order and got nothing but an excuse that they were busy and then gave me attitude when I expressed my opinion in what I thought about her excuse. The manager wasn't much better when I told him why that was such a problem he simply said fries usually take 5 minutes to make, when I had just told him I had waited over 15 minutes for the 2nd order of fries. Never going to this place again since the food was just ok and the staff was disorganized, rude and simply terrible in what they do."}
{"text":"I usually like the Avacado Bacon burger, but decided to have a small dinner salad with blue cheese dressing this time.  I couldn't eat my salad, the dressing was like a thin mayonaise mixture; a sour, thin, non-fat dressing texture.  My daughters Southwestern salad had a simular thin dressing mixture.  

The restaurant was not that busy, it was a Saturday afternoon, we were seated in the bar.  Our server was also the bartender.  He could care less about checking on us.  My regular  margarita, on the rocks, tasted like soap and had a milky color to it.  

We were very disappointed, usually Red Robin is pretty good."}
{"text":"I'm the problem customer that no server wants and always wants to talk to the manager. Tonight I came here with my wife after a particularly long day and there was a ten minute wait on a table so we sat at the bar. I'm glad we did because our server (bartender) Michael was really on top of it! He talked me into several drinks and really turned my night around. My wife had a really good time also and the food was acceptable quality also. I wanted to complain about the fries being cold but I was having too much of a good time. Was going to give four stars but Michael went above and beyond."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch on Monday while I was running errands. The restaurant was pretty busy, but the server was on top of everything. Food was great, and service to match."}
{"text":"Food was average but the service was not good. Very slow and I always needed something but my waiter hardly came around and when he did it took him awhile to get anything"}
{"text":"Red Robin is a good burger joint ,my burger was cooked perfect for me lots of bacon (ie pig out burger).
Lots of fries.  Very busy place.  They also have lots of speciality drinks, milkshakes.  Very nice place too hang out with friends.  I really like red robin.  Good variety of burgers,salads. The french onion soup is really good if your husband doesn't steal your cheese. And our friend had clam chowder he said it was very good.   So all in all its a great place too meet friends hang out and visit."}
{"text":"Went the other day and was blown away. Service has improved so much in the little amount of time since I have been there! Ordered the Mac and cheese burger and it was delicious. They brought out fries for us to snack on while we waited for our burgers, which only took around 10 minutes to come out. Our server was attentive and took care of us really well. So happy that this Red Robin location seems to be on the right track!!!"}
{"text":"We have visited Red Robin at once a week for the past few months.  Service is off and on.  There are servers, like Jack, that know us now, so they definitely take care of us.  However, tonight was a disaster!  Jack was definitely not working tonight.  We arrived at 6:30pm and the restaurant was less than half full.  We ordered a short stack of onion rings, which we received in a timely manner.  At 7:05pm, we asked about our meals (we had 2 hungry kids who had just finished their sports' practices).  The waitress told us that our order was still 2 tickets back because they had a 17 person ticket and had only gotten 10 burgers out of that order.  My son actually looked around and informed me that he didn't see any table that had 17 people in it.  My husband and I also looked around and didn't see any.  By 7:30pm, we still had not received our meals and my son (who had wanted to come to Red Robin for his birthday which is tomorrow) was in tears!  My husband went to talk to our waitress who was standing in the kitchen and asked when our food would be coming out - she said they were still waiting on their mac-n-cheese!  I can freaking make mac-n-cheese at home in less than 15 minutes!  Also, I had ordered the BLTA and my husband ordered a salad.  As I walked out with my kids to take them to Burger King, there were at least 4 different parties in the waiting area to be seated as the restaurant was less than half full.  My husband talked to the staff about their poor service and he was given a gift card and an excuse of them being \"slammed\".  We will probably not be visiting this Red Robin on Elliot for quite a while...again.

***UPDATE*** Just checked the gift card balance for the card they gave my husband -- it has $0 on it!!  Website states \"Invalid account number or the account is closed\".  Wow...awesome customer service."}
{"text":"We had a great eating experience. The waitress was very friendly and. The food was very tasty. The burgers are cooked to perfection and the toppings to choose from are delicious. I totally recommend the mac & cheese with side salad combo. Portions are great. You can't beat the endless fries that come with the burgers and endless salad with the mac & cheese!"}
{"text":"like always the burger taste great in red robin , but the table was so dirty and sticky.
we cleaned the table using some of our baby pampers tissue and it tuned black :("}
{"text":"Just left the soft opening at this new location and  cannot be more pleased.  Food came out quickly and it was all delicious.  Kiley, our waitress, did great.  We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is fine, but the service is not. This location is next door to a Chick-fil-A and close to a Starbucks - both establishments consistently demonstrate exceptional customer service! Red Robin needs to step it up and at least try to provide similar service. Something was wrong with the website, so I was unable to place an online order and had to call instead. The first person took my name, then placed me on a \"brief\" hold. The next person who picked up simply said, \"Hello?\" I said hello and explained that I needed to place an order to go. He said \"ok\" at which point I had to ask if I could give him my order. Anyone answering the phone should possess basic customer service and phone skills. It's annoying to try to beg a business to meet your basic needs, and even more so when you're forced to engage employees with no customer service skills."}
{"text":"Very confusing menu now. Yes, you can get a $6.99 burger, but apparently that contains the lowest form of beef possible. You can also hit up the mid level burgers for $10 or so and then you get to the Angus world where burgers top out at almost $14. Everybody gets the same fries, but shouldn't the fancier burger eaters get an upgraded french fry?
    Due to 13 days straight of annoying Xmas burger emails and a 50% off deal, we found ourselves near a Robin and headed inside. Somebody had to buy a Grilled Burger and then someone else would get half off another burger. The bacon deluxe was my top level choice and all it had was cheddar and bacon and a better brioche bun and a larger patty. It was pretty good for a chain, nothing memorable. The memorable thing was Old Dominion winning the football bowl game we watched in the crowded bar at lunchtime. Nice waitress made for a smooth meal amongst all the harried XMas shoppers."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Went for dinner with my family. We were a party of six. They said we had to wait for 15 min. for our table. In the meantime about 12 people were seated even though they came in after us. The restaurant was half empty. I guess there was only 1 table we could sit at! We decided to leave. I asked to speak with the manager, who made me wait for 5 minutes! She apologized and said she didn't understand why we hadn't been seated. Poor management! Will never go back there!"}
{"text":"Red Robin isn't my first choice for burgers, but I'm not opposed if someone else suggests it. That said, I can't remember the last time I went to one and it seems like they've made several changes: menu has expanded to offer a premium line of burgers and they have more chicken sandwiches, salads, and other non-burger entrees. There are also a lot of customization options from buns to fry sauces (some with an upcharge) and \"premium\" sides that I don't recall from previous visits.

The Bleu Ribbon burger was decent, with fried onion straws and a good amount of cheese. I upgraded my fries to the garlic-parm version, which were just a sprinkle of fried garlic and a pinch of cheese added to the regular steak fries- the flavor was pretty subtle. Note that burgers here must be cooked to at least medium, for some reason.  Service at the bar was adequate and one guy in particular was especially outgoing. All seats/tables are provided with a touch screen to summon your server, review featured specials, or play games while you wait. I'm all for using tech to streamline services but pushing a button to summon the bartender right in front of you is just weird."}
{"text":"I have never had anything bad to say about this place in general and usually when we go it's busy as heck and we have to wait to be seated. I have never had to wait more than 45 minutes for food on a BUSY night but everything was horrible at this location. We went yesterday and since it was Memorial Day weekend we expected it to be pretty busy. Well... it wasn't! At all! There were many many seats so we were seated immediately. The server we had was horrible and pretty rude and seemed as though he was always in a rush like he was irritated or something. But of course he was nice once tip time came. We had to ask for water 3 times that he never brought. We finally asked the food runner who came with our food over an hour later to bring us water which she did. We literally watched everyone around us who came later than we did receive their food and drinks. 

Maybe it was just our waiter but he's also not the on cooking the food so can't blame him for waiting 1 1/2 to receive 3 basic entrees. 

It was a pretty bad experience and we won't come to this location again."}
{"text":"7pm on a Thursday night and we had to wait for 20 minutes for a table. 
Then more wait to be notice by our server. 
Took forever to get our food.
I asked for a water, and they server asked me \"bottle or tap?\"  which is a fair question I assume.  But when I was caught off guard, because I wasn't used to the question, he said \"I ask because I refuse to drink tap water, it's gross\"....that was a bit much."}
{"text":"A decent place for gourmet burgers. I had the DBG burger with french onion soup and that was just the right amount for lunch. Came during lunch on a Tuesday and was seated immediately. Unfortunately I was seated at the corner and server did not know I was there for a long while. They have a new table side system that you can call for the server, and I pressed the button - still no server. I think the server calling system simply changes the light on top of the unit to red so if no one saw it, no one knows you are there. I was about to leave when the server came over and apologizes with a \"you sneaked passed me  ...\" joke. No - I was seated by another staff - did not snuck in.

Anyway, the rating is for the food. Ordered the DGB burger with french onion soup and it was good. Juicy inside and sauce is tasty. The French onion soup is OK. onions, beef broth, bread and cheese baked in an oven. Oh - i did not know when he said fries or soup, choosing soup adds an extra cost to the bill.

The table side system also allows you to check out quickly with a credit card. While I like the efficiency of these systems, I find that it takes away the service part of a restaurant. I can order and pay right from there - so maybe I don't have to tip that much since all the servers do is to give me water and bring out my food."}
{"text":"OMG, I love Red Robin!

I'm usually not very into chain restaurants and I prefer to eat at small local businesses, but I was so happy when I moved here and saw that there's a Red Robin!

I'm a vegetarian, and they substitute boca burgers on any of their burgers. The 'shroom burger is awesome! My roommate loves the Whisky River BBQ burger.

We crave it. We're junkies. We constantly talk about how we need to get our next fix, nahhh."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here I leave hating myself.  Which is quite a conundrum because the service is evenly good, the burgers are usually tasty and high quality, and the fries just keep on coming and coming and coming.  That last part would be the self-hate inducing aspect of the visit.

Like breakfast?!  Have the Royal Red Robin burger ... it is MAGNIFICENT."}
{"text":"When you have a craving for meat... a burger here will do the trick.
Unfortunately there are TV screens throughout and it is very noisy inside.
You may sit out on patio but then you are inhaling gas fumes from passing cars.
Service is ok, you're treated more like a number as opposed to a real person.
It's like ....the faster they serve you the faster you are out of there for another person."}
{"text":"I like RR. I'm willing to pay the outragious price for some drink with a long name here. I love the burger choices, the hot wings, the seafood splatter. Oh and the bottomless Root Beer float!  I love the new Royality Card.  The staff here is very good, some of the best service in AZ. Which says a lot because AZ is unfortunately known for awful service."}
{"text":"In there today after an extended break.  Great sweet potato fries still.  Very attentive bar staff.  Big minus is no Wifi."}
{"text":"It's Super Bowl Sunday... me and my honey decided it would be a good idea to order Red Robin to go, so we could eat at home while watching the game. We scheduled our order to be ready by 4:00 pm, as the game/coin toss started 4:15-4:30. We were very disappointed. The food tasted like it had been cooked LONG before it was scheduled to be ready. We expected a hot burger and hot fries, as we scheduled the order to be picked up at 4:00. We even got there ten mins early and it was already cold. Very upsetting! We just spent 35.00 bucks on something that isn't edible. Nobody likes cold cheeseburgers and fries. Thanks for ruining our Super Bowl meal."}
{"text":"Busy busy Saturday afternoon, not enough workers. Hostess was not welcoming at all. Could tell waitress was overwhelmed. Drink runner seemed clueless about what to do with our extra shake (they had given us the wrong one before making another one, I don't know maybe like telling us \"go ahead and keep that one, you're new one is coming right out\"...it was awkward ), food was okay but not worth the prices. Red Robin is seriously a let down now a day, what happened to burgers and fries being served in baskets and reaaaaal bottomless fries, not a sprinkle of fries decorated in a \"fancy\" tin cup?? So I guess if you want the bottomless fries, you have to ask? Unclear, server didn't offer or explain..."}
{"text":"Sobhaoot to have Red Robin close.  Love the new building and seating.  Food was great!  I took one star away because the server barely checked on is and my son's apples were not good.  Besides thay, fantastic. :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring the family, and try all the variety of burgers, one thing you will love... the bottomless sides.
Great prices, great service."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and very attentive. And the food is always amazing!!!! I had their Boca burger the last time I went, as I stopped eating meat. It was so good. I'll definitely be back, knowing I can still enjoy a meatless burger. The fried zucchini and mushrooms though....omg. They're to die for! My mom had never been to Red Robin and she loved it."}
{"text":"I don't frequent chain restaurants often, but Red Robin is one that I've found to be fairly consistent- surprisingly large menu for a burger spot, easy to accommodate various diet requests and requirements, typically friendly staff.

Came in armed with a free birthday burger coupon (join their e-club for yours!) and opted for the Arctic Cod, in a lettuce wrap. Subbed a cup of chili for the fries, and added on a wedge salad. Food arrived hot and fresh, chili had a good spicy kick to it, service at the bar was attentive and engaging throughout.

 While the service is good and the food isn't bad, their meals are extremely average for the $10-15/pp pricing, hence why my visits are pretty rare (maybe twice a year). 

Note that the bar is not visible from the entry- possibly to preserve the family-friendly-feel? Go in and hang a left to find it. Bonus points for being one of the few stand-alone restaurants in the Downtown Summerlin area, making for easier parking."}
{"text":"Awesome company!  Thank you for supporting education field and everybody involved with it. We went in for the free hamburger offer and it was a great experience. The waiting line was long but everybody was seated in 10 mins. Our server was on point always making sure we had what we needed was taken care of. The burgers and fries were very good."}
{"text":"I love red robin. Who can say no to bottomless fries?! Food is generally consistent, but sometimes we get cold fries which is a let down. But cooks are generally good at making sure the burger is cooked to your liking. Love their ranch and campfire sauce! Tonight we had family dinner and my poor pregnant self couldn't get the waitress to get me a refill of water. So I just downed hubbys water..... but i needed more water after that but the food was good and the waitress was very friendly.  Lol. Staff is usually very friendly and usually more attentive, tonight we came for the dinner rush. But this place can get really loud since red robin is a family friendly place."}
{"text":"The food was average, regular chain restaurant food. Our waitress was wonderful, and super helpful-always available when we needed her. Unfortunately they got my daughter's order wrong so we had to wait for her food."}
{"text":"Had a great time. Sat at the bar, Ryan and Rachel are awesome! Ask for them by name. Love the new look! I'll be here every week!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was comfortable enough. 

I like the idea of having a wide variety of interesting burger choices. 

What I don't like is that they use poor quality meat in their burgers. 

No amount of bleu cheese or steak sauce can make up for the fact that you are essentially eating a Denny's burger."}
{"text":"Here's a recent update:  Having returned because of a very nice manager, we were unhappily surprised by changes.  To wit:  They have now put on the tables those electronic things where you order your food (yes, I know they have them at Applebee's, and that's why we never eat there).  You use them order your appetizers, drinks and desserts.  The only thing you order from the server is your entree.  When our server showed up - after a really long time - she told us she was late because she was tired from having worked a double shift the day before.  I don't care.  Your job is to be on time, not making customers wait.  Then when I questioned her about the little kiosk, she told us everyone has them now (no, they don't) and also told us she didn't have to worry about her job because she was 'irreplaceable.'  Really?  The cemetery is full of irreplaceable people.  After we ordered, we never saw her again.  (The food was brought out by an expediter).  She never even refilled our drinks, or came over to see if the shake we ordered was any good.

So here's the bottom line:  Order appetizer from kiosk.  Order drinks (non-alcoholic) from kiosk.  Order entree from server.  Order dessert from kiosk.  Pay with a credit card at kiosk.  Practically self-service now.  Since the server is doing 1/4 of the work (3/4 being done by machine) does she deserve a full tip?  No.  Only 1/4 work deserves 1/4 tip.  If I want self-service, I'll get fast food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place went to use my birthday burger :) I got chicken with lettuce wrap, and sweet potato fries. Service was fast and friendly I'd recommend it and will go
Again"}
{"text":"It concerns me that I call myself a food snob and then give red robin five stars.  but: did you have the burger I just had there?  I can slum it with the best of them but the reason why RR gets the big five stars from me is that even though it's not high rent, the food is really fucking tasty.

to wit: today I had a burger with a fried egg on it, with three strips of bacon.  Delicious.  Sloppy.  Hot.  Tasty.  Fatty.  Perfect.  Really, I can tell you that that burger is one of the better burgers I've ever eaten.

It also comes with these garlic parmesan fries that are hell on your co-workers' olfactory sensibilities but what have they done for me lately?

I have, many times, had the california chicken burger--sloppy, with guacamole and bacon and it is really damn good.  I know, I know, how dare I?  Well I dare, bitch.  I dare.

Plus the fries are free refills."}
{"text":"The food was average for a chain restaurant and I probably wouldn't  be writing this review as this is one of our \"so-so\" eateries we can just go into and get a quick bite in a set down environment.  (We always eat  in the bar because. It is self seating and we don't have to have kids pawing at us over the back of a booth) But the last three times we've eaten there they didn't get our order right.
    The first time my wife ordered one of their signature sandwiches and they forgot the cheese and I had ordered their Garlic fries and it came out with regular fries.  Both orders were immediately correct but they should have been checked before leaving the line.
    The next time we went my wife ordered an appetizer that never arrived.  When our meal arrived the server wanted to know if we still wanted it.  After we told her no she forgot to take it off the bill and we had to ask for it to be removed.
    The last time my wife ordered one of their signature appetizers that you could pick two items.  She asked for mushrooms and zucchini and mushrooms and cheese sticks showed up... Enough is enough... Average food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"When this location opened, it was on par with the original location in Washington, PA. Service was good, and the food was above average. But the last 2 or 3 times we've gone there, it seems to be getting worse. The quality of the food has gone downhill, too. I have a feeling they are cutting back on the ingredients quality, but that is just my opinion. The pineapple on the Banzai burger seemed less than proper. And now they have these new little kiosk monitors on the tables remove your server from the dining experience. After the meal, we got our check and the server took the check and giftcards we were paying with and returned the receipts for the giftcards. No check. We had no idea how much of the giftcards were applied. And then, the server was nowhere to be found,
I would rather drive to Washington (25 minutes) than go to this location (5 minutes).
Doubt I will be going back to this location."}
{"text":"This was the first time my wife and I eat at this restaurant, but we usually save it for special occasions, since it isn't cheap. This time my wife had a Bacon Cheese Burger and I had the Fish and Chips. The fries were good and my wife really liked her hamburger , but the fish, well, if you like finding pieces of a Brillo pad mixed up in that batter, go for it. At first I thought it was pieces of dust, then realized that it was steel wool. I really couldn't believe it. I showed our waitress, then the manager came over and apologized, it seemed the Brillo pad had jumped into the batter. he didn't charge us for the fish and chips, but beware. The Blue Pomegranate Limeade is new, I didn't like it, maybe you should ask for a sample before buying it."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for lunch so I can sit in the bar area. I've always had great service and it's quick too. I usually grab the crispy chicken salad or the Ensenada chicken platter. Sign up for their RR loyalty program and your 10th one is free. They also send you a coupon for your birthday. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"While at the restaurant, I overheard management speaking to one of their employees extremely disrespectful. I was appalled at the disrespect of this establishment at the San tan location. I would never speak to someone in this manner. This should be looked into."}
{"text":"This was terrible the service in this place awful had a hostess who either was racist and don't like brown people who pass us to another hostess who was a kid that just had one table to help which was us. She was rude and only pick the people she thought would or look like give her more tip money. Too bad she miss out on tip money I tip pretty good.  So if you go there and you are switch to another server then you don't fit the profile she wants. White blue eyes and fancy clothes the food was greasy.   Oh and this was at Tempe marketplace in Tempe Arizona.  The superstition springs one much better slow people.  But 1 % Better"}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious burgers and fries. Will definitely come back. Recommend your try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were seated promptly.  Server was harried but after 5 minutes did take our drink order and 5 minutes later we placed our food order.  Two other parties were seated after we placed our order and in a short time placed their orders as well.  The place was pretty busy, and after 20 minutes asked for some fries to tide us over.  Was told they were backed up on the fries but 
she'd be on it as soon as she could.  20 minutes in onion rings show up for the 2nd party seated after us and a couple of minutes later our fries appear.  Then the manager, who's helping out our server then shows up delivering food to the couple who had come in after us, while our server delivered food to the 3rd party.  At that point we had had enough.  Waited to speak to the manager on our way out, to see about paying for our drinks.  She claims she'd bring our order right out.  No thanks.  She comped us the Coke.  Been a Loyalty Member since they opened in Surprise, made a huge mistake going to the Peoria location.

{"text":"While the Waterfront is a bit out of my way, since it has the theater that's closest to a number of friends, I'm often in the area; my friends are also major Red Robin fans, so I've found myself eating dinner here multiple times before our movie.

To be honest, I kind of have a love-hate relationship with Red Robin. It's certainly not my favorite place to eat, particularly during my casual dieting days. Not only are the burgers oversized and/or glazed in some sort of dressing or sauce, all of their appetizers are fried (except for the hummus plate). In short, nothing is waistline friendly unless you're \"that person\" who asks for tons of modifications in their order. I honestly don't think this chain has any interest in developing a lighter option menu, despite these menus' popularity at other restaurants. The only low-calorie item I know of is their skinny margarita, which really doesn't make much of a difference in my calorie intake once the rest of a meal is added in. So that's a big drawback for me.

Still, high calorie content or not, I'm a fan of a good burger, and Red Robin can make a reasonably good burger in my experience. Even when I've just shared a meal or nibbled on an appetizer (yes, the same appetizers I complained about earlier - like I said, it's a love-hate relationship) I've been satisfied with the taste and quality of the food given that the place is a chain restaurant. 

I've especially been impressed with the servers, who really take the time to check on the table whenever I'm there and to keep us posted on the state of our food in the kitchen (which is very appreciated during the dinner rush, a time of day when any customer can feel forgotten and aggravated).

I guess I have to accept what Red Robin for what it is: delicious with a strong dash of dieter's frustration. I'm sure I'll be here again, and, as always, will end up giving in and eating one of their delicious burgers, even if the things are just too much food for little old me. Like I said: love-hate relationship."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, wonderful waiters and usually food is served quickly. Great place to have a good night out with friends and colleagues. Now there loyalty program is AMAZING. Lots of places have you a free starter for your B-Day they give you a free burger. You also get $20 for going 5 times in a specific time frame."}

{"text":"Red Robin, Yum! 'Twas the night before our college daughter returned to school. We chose to celebrate at my husband's favorite burger joint. We loved the free flow of fries and refills on specialty lemonades. We paid $.99 extra for fries but found out that they nickel and dime each person who indicated they wanted garlic fries. I had the Double Mac and Cheese Burger for $6.99. The patties were delicious, the buns were a little soft. The mac and cheese just made the burger more cheesy. I was satisfied. My husband had the Smokin' Pepper Burger ($13.99). The Smokin' Pepper Ketchup is an extra $.75. My son had the double Tavern Burger for $6.99. Our waitress, Asha, was super nice and helpful. When we inquired about the extra charges, she explained what they were but took them off since it was unclear, and it was our first time. In the future, we will be more informed in regards to the fine print. It was still YUM!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, not very busy.  Food was not that good.  Burger was burnt on one side, hamburger, fries and ice tea was $16.  Sorry will not be back."}
{"text":"No waiting which was nice but it took forever to get a server to come to our table and when they brought our our no napkins no utensils. We ordered Tea no sweetener  it's those little things so we did end up waiting in the long run."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant. It's been over ten years since I've been to Red Robin. Out of all the restaurants on Stapley I decided to choose Red Robin....I regret it. What a waste of 20 minutes.  

A hostess sat us down and then we waited 10 minutes and decided to leave. Horrible service. No server ever came to our table to grab our drinks. 

People around us even looked upset. I'm glad I decided to walk out. On our way out nobody even acknowledged us. 

Management needs some review. 

Beware and good luck! :)"}
{"text":"Red Robin establishment in Surprise, AZ. The waiter forgot to bring our fries ahead of time with our campfire sauce before our meal. Our freckled lemonade was tasty. Our Southern Charm sandwich was perfectly done. We asked for fries and campfire sauce to go. Almost a perfect meal!"}
{"text":"Unlimited fries and refills on specialty drinks. We came here to celebrate our college bound daughter. We love Red Robin because of their steak fries and amazing sauces. We all have our different favorites: campfire sauce, buffalo sauce, and thick rank. We ate fries before our burgers came, during the burger meals and also after the meal. We even ordered 3 steak fries to go.

Specialty drinks. We love the Freckled Lemonade, the Poppin' Purple. The Berry, Berry Limeade is also tasty. We drink our fill and also took a couple of drinks on the go.

Burgers range from $7 to $14. I got the Sriracha Double Tavern for $7. Tasty burger in a soft sesame bun. The crispy onion rings inside is awesome. Everyone at our table enjoyed their burgers. 

We ate our fill and more. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"This time the food was really good, but the Server was Amazing. Best server I've had in many years.  She had perfect timing. Refills were coming as we were asking for a refill. Only issue was table was gross. I wiped my napkin when we sat and it became brown. Try actually cleaning the tables with a cleaning solution / degreaser!"}
{"text":"They have really awesome wraps and chicken tortilla soup. To die for. Plus, an added bonus. Really great service. If your ever in the neighborhood.  Ask for, Devon!!!! Shes so full of life and really down to earth. Has a great sense of humor and urgency. Picked up my lunch for the day. Super fast and super hott. Thanx red robin.....yummmmmmmmmmmmm=)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now. I will continue to do so, as a group goes here Sunday evenings, and I enjoy the night out. But I'd prefer eating elsewhere.

  For starters, the burgers. I know people who rave about Red Robin burgers...nothing I've had here would set me to raving. The burgers are restaurant burgers; a bit better than McDonald's or similar, but nowhere near what I can do at home, and more costly. Nothing here sets it apart from any other mediocre restaurant style burger place.

  Of the two times I've eaten here, I once had the burger come pink -extremely- pink (like, 'rare'; I asked for medium. I think it was just rushed out of the kitchen because I ordered later than the rest of my party. If you don't like that, explicitly state 'no pink'), and the other time, there was a misunderstanding what I wanted (I asked for the Royal Red Robin burger, the waitress said \"You mean the cheeseburger?\" I didn't have the menu any more, and didn't remember if it had cheese on it or not, so said \"Uh...I guess?\" Apparently not), which wasn't exactly the restaurants fault, but was still really weird and kinda made it less appealing. That said, neither burger was worth the ~$10 I shelled out for it.

  I'm just...not enthused."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Server was great, however a little on the slow side. Our ketchup bottle was empty, by the time we rec'd another bottle we were almost done with our meals.
The worst part of this experience was the stupid computer thing that's supposed to be convenient. It's the worst! VERY frustrating!! The lettering is tiny and it was out of paper for a receipt.  We don't want to use a computer, we want our waitress to give us the bill. We don't attend a restaurant to serve ourselves. You'll get left with no tip."}
{"text":"We just went for my mom's birthday. We normally have not-so-good service in restaurants but Ren was amazing! She was very nice and funny. We had a pass for a free appetizer (from a terrible experience at another location) that was expired and we didn't realize. She double checked to see if they could honor it and they did. She also offered to place special orders for my mom who has a hard time chewing. Overall, a very attentive server with personality."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Double thumbs down. Short brown hair on my salad plate. The beef on the tavern burger is low grade, charbroiled patties. Reminded me of Burger King burgers I ate when I was in high school. We always get the tavern burger at other locations so not sure what this was all about. Just leaving the restaurant and we feel sick to our stomaches. Ick."}
{"text":"We always leave full, and the food is terrific. Cannot say that I've ever had an issue with service. I usually stick to salads and chicken, but last time I had a burger, and oh my lord, was that a good burger !!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this place.  Yesterday Sunday 6/3/18 around 4:00 PM we ordered food and my little boy ordered the breaded chicken wings/nuggets and it was raw.  They served us raw chicken!...They never cooked the chicken.  Thank god I took a wing out of his plate and realize it was raw!  I cannot believe this.  This is unacceptable, what's wrong with you guys? I am extremely angry and concerned that my child could get food poisoning or extremely ill for consuming raw chicken"}
{"text":"Low-carb options...they offer a lettuce wrap instead of a bun. Broccoli instead if fries. Also offer gluten free buns. If you're not into that, bottomless fries!"}
{"text":"Ordered the siracha double. Order was wrong. Server didn't seem too concerned. Manager apologized and removed the item from my ticket. Ordered water, but it tasted worse than dish water. Not good quality. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Red Robin location for over 6 years.  The servers are really good. I don't think I've ever had anthing I didnt like.This location is very busy on the weekends but weekday nights is pretty slow. Which is nice for a quiet dinner. 
My favorite burger is the black and blue burger, this thing is awesome!  Bottomless steam broccoli on the side my favorit.  If I want fries I have some from my kid's plate they're bottomless too. Today my husband had the garlic fries. This is the best part we can all share. The cob burger is also really good although I did not see it on the menus this time. The patty melt is another one of my favorites. This is my local hamburger joint. Stop by whatever type of burger you want they can make it."}
{"text":"Awesome meal and better service. Ordered the Royal Robin. Egg on top was cooked to perfection. The waitress brought my endless fries early, like an appetizer. The wife got the smoke and pepper burger. Seasoning was just right. For desert we did the towering doh nuts. Fantastic with the dipping sauce. Best part of the meal was the red head waitress. She was fantastic, funny, and up beat about everything. She really made the meal more fun."}
{"text":"Gourmet Burgers- NOT - steak fries were good but burgers were thin frozen patties - I would have went to McDonalds if I wanted that type of burger.  Service was good - nice atmosphere.  Tea was $3 draft beer $3.50.   Won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My Mom, BF and I went to Red Robin for lunch today.  It is one of our favorite places!  Michael and I usually order the Red Robin Tavern Double - protein style - which means it comes in a lettuce wrap instead of on a bun. He does so because he is a recently diagnosed Diabetic.  I do so because I am newly Gluten Free. 
     Today, I happened to overhear a customer place an order at the bar for a burger on the Gluten Free bun.  RED ROBIN HAS A GLUTEN FREE BUN???!!! I asked our server, Bree, about this and she said they've had it on their menu for a few months now.  She asked if I wanted her to bring one out to try but I didn't want her to go to any trouble and declined and said that I may try it next visit.  But she brought one out anyway.
     It was warm and the small piece I tried was soft and had a wonderful, 'real' bread texture! It was great!!! But, unfortunately, within a few minutes, I started coughing. When she came back to ask what I thought about it, I told her that, as good as it was, I had an allergic reaction. Poor thing had to deal with me coughing as we spoke and she felt terrible.  I told her not to feel bad - that I truly appreciated being able to try the GF bun. She kept apologizing and said she would go back to check the ingredients.  
     A few minutes later, the manager on duty, Rick - if I remember correctly - showed up at our table.  He said he heard about my allergic reaction and wanted to make sure I was okay and didn't need any medical attention. He told us that he checked the box the bun came in and did not see any wheat on it. We assured him that I was fine. 
     Bree stopped by again and said the only thing she could think of was that she didn't call out 'ALLERGY ALERT' when she ordered the bun and that the cook would not have changed gloves as he would have if she did announce that first.  Again, we told her not to stress about this. But that maybe we'll try it again, on the side, next visit and to remind our server to call out 'ALLERGY ALERT'.  Can I be that sensitive?
   My point is, my allergic reaction aside, we had a great experience at Red Robin. We always do! And the service and attention to my dietary needs today was exceptional!"}
{"text":"I can't count the number of times that I've been to this Red Robin. This store harbors so many memories, it's hard to count. That being said, I made a costly mistake this last time I found myself here for lunch: I ordered a salad and chili. The chili was amazing, spicy and full of flavor. The salad, on the other hand was bland and tasteless, even with their balsamic vinaigrette. I can't hold it against them, though, because I knew full and well that Red Robin specializes in burgers. Do not stray from their burger menu - no matter how good the pictures make the other food look!!

Whenever I've ordered a delicious burger (I've never had a bad burger here), I've always had consistently fast and courteous service. No matter how busy the place is, the wait staff ensures that your drink is never empty, your appetizer is delivered quickly (highly recommend the onion ring tower), and your food is cooked to your exact specifications. They are also great for medium-sized groups and their bar is perfect if you want to watch your favorite game with a moderately-priced beer in hand."}
{"text":"We came in during lunchtime. Very good service - it was really busy. The server was attentive, checked on us several times - made sure our drinks, bottomless fries, cole slaw and everything was to our satisfaction. Their Gourmet burgers were delish. Fish and chips were good too. I would come back to this location again."}
{"text":"Food is halfway decent for what it is. The reason for two stars is the SERVICE, or lack there of. Every time I visit this location I'm so disappointed. Always seems completely understaffed. My last and final visit I ordered Togo. I stood at the front for ten min before anyone even came up. The entire lobby was packed full of confused guests. The dining room floor did not seem busy whatsoever. Finally a young man came up and took my name. He was very friendly and helpful but the look on his face read overwhelmed. They have the poor guy seating people and doing Togo. It was insufficient. In total I was in Red Robin's lobby 38 minutes. For Togo food. Needless to say when I got home my salad was wilted having been packed with once warm food. My family's food was cold. Fries soggy. Altogether nasty. Red Robin needs to focus more on customer service and properly staffing the restaurant. I honestly can't believe this location is still open."}
{"text":"Four stars is a blended rating.  Asley our server gets five - attentive, polite,  and accomodating.  Our food on the other hand was just okay.  We ordered chicken wings and onion rings for apps. The wings were good, but the onion rings are sliced too thick so the breading fell off.  Burgers were cheeseburger-bacon and guacamole-bacon. Not bad, but nothing to write home about either.  Had a shake too.  Again so-so.  I'll be back though.  I'm a sucker for great service and will find something I can rave about."}
{"text":"Not impressed, this visit the food was very poorly prepared. My daughters burger was burnt twice, yes twice. The first time we sent back and where told that there was a problem with the grill, they brought her another and it was burnt also.  Had it removed from the bill.

My other daughter and wife had wings, very dry and rough.

The fries (unilimited for free) are big steak fries, I am not a fan of them at all. 

The server we had was amazing, she did a wonderful job and felt bad that the food was not up to pare."}
{"text":"Have gone to this location many times and never had any problems whether it was early in the afternoon for lunch (not busy) or on weekend dinnertime (packed). Smoke and Pepper burger is great."}
{"text":"Great food, terrific service, reasonable prices. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"On 12/10/15 This Red Robin location participated in the following promotion: Name That Chicken. Guests with Christmas themed names had the opportunity to dine at the establishment and receive a free chicken sandwich. My first name is Holli-Noelle. My middle name is Caroline. With the anticipation of trying the new chicken sandwich for free, I got in my car and drove to Red Robin. 

Upon arrival at the restaurant I asked the host if he needed to see my ID to verify my name. The host said that wouldn't be necessary until I placed my order. After sitting down and ordering a drink, I explained my name to my waitress. She stated that she would need to check with her manager. A man who had all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile. I overheard the manager explain to my waitress that my name, \"just happened to be Christmasy\". 

When my waitress returned to my service, she reported that my name did not qualify for the promotion because it is not related to Chris Kringle. Naturally I was devastated...because my name is Holli-Noelle Caroline. The insult hurt like a snowball in the face. If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if I was born on Christmas Day, I could have purchased dinner for every guest in the restaurant that evening. 

I'm disappointed in the Scrooge-like stance Red Robin has on offering a free meal to someone with so much Christmas in their name. 

Happy Holidays, 
Holli-Noelle Caroline L."}
{"text":"Yet another corporate restaurant that loves to play musical chairs with their menu.  Seems month to month you don't know what they'll remove and what new thing they'll add.  Think about it, a class A restaurant that actually does make a good burger doesn't need to play hide and seek with their menu items . . . ever!

If I were to rate Red Robin burgers over other burgers I've had in my life, I'd give them around a 5/10.  They are simply sub-par and lack any real good burger flavor.  I did enjoy a pot roast burger they used to make, but good old corporate idiots took it off the menu.

The main thing with any Red Robin is it's all about atmosphere and friendly service, which they do rate a 10 in that department.  Unfortunately, the food is nothing to write home about.  There's literally nothing on their menu that I would find so good it's addictive, and isn't really, really good food what a restaurant should be about?  It's kind of sad, really.  They do have all the right flair and decent service, but the food is so corporate average that it makes the rest of the experience dull."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever! took 2 hrs to get 2 burgers! felt sick half way through the wait and went home to the doctor and realized i caught strep throat from this restaurant!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that most of the reasons this place gets only 2 stars has to do with my opinion that the whole Red Robin chain has gone downhill in recent years. The meat is not particularly tasty anymore and the bottomless fries are now served in a literally bottomless cup which is more of a hassle than it's worth. So it goes, I suppose.

There were somethings that I made this particular visit sub-par though. The restaurant was absolutely freezing. Even after our food arrived we had to ask 2 different servers for utensils so that we could have napkins. Were either of these things disastrous? No. But they were unpleasant and when coupled with the prior comments about the  food were enough to make me think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"Very good food and fun atmosphere. The waitress we got kept bringing water with lemon even though she was asked repeatedly to bring it without lemon. But other than that, the food was great. The few times I've been there I've always enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review.  I've never had an experience bad enough for me to feel compelled to actually write about it.

My wife and I used to love Red Robin, and this one is really close to our house.  We haven't been there for about a year, since young kids are not always conducive to a great dining experience.  After tonight's visit, I feel like my four year-old could run this place better.

We arrived around 6:30 on a Wednesday night.  Not exactly prime time.  There were plenty of open tables and we were sat pretty much right away and assured our server would be \"right with us.\"  Twelve minute later, our server comes by for our drink order.  We let her know we were ready to order our food too, and placed our food order.  My wife got the Whisky River BBQ Chicken wrap, and I got the Tavern burger with mustard and pickles.  We ordered a corn dog and a milk shake for my son, and chicken tenders with milk for my daughter.  My wife also asked for some fries in advance (typical when we come here) to give the kids something to nibble on/distract them.

This is when the wait starts.  We got our drinks a few minutes later, but our server told us something was preventing the shake from being ready (I'm not sure what the issue was).  Still no fries.  We wait some more, still nothing.  Finally, after about 20 minutes, our server brings the fries out, and then our food arrives 30 seconds later.  Lots of good those fries did.  When she came by, the server said the shake was still not ready and the manager would be comping it.

Upon looking at my burger, I realized they did not include the mustard or pickles, so I waited another six minutes to flag down our server and let her know.  A few minutes later, she brought the mustard and pickles.  The burger was good, and my wife said her wrap was \"fine.\"

Our daughter then projectile vomited all over my wife, which we think was from the milk being old.  Hard to verify, but she isn't sick and was fine all night after we got home.  

So my wife left with my daughter, and my son and I stayed behind to pay for the meal.  The manager finally comes by with the shake, assuring me we would not be charged for it.  This was pretty underwhelming, as it was a 99 cents children's milkshake.  How hard it is to mix some ice cream and milk.  I paid and left, vowing to never return to this location.  Seriously, don't bother.  There are plenty of great restaurants to go to around the mall.  Pick ANY other place and you'll have a better experience."}
{"text":"One thing that I really like about chain restaurants is that they're generally safe bets and you can come in knowing what to expect in terms of food, service, and cleanliness. As soon as we walked in we were seated at a table that had a few crumbs left behind and was a bit sticky. The server asked us what he could get us before we even had a chance to really sit down, and when we received our drinks the straws were already in the drinks - this is a huge pet peeve of mine since I generally like my straw wrapped and I don't have to worry about cross-contamination between server and patron. Okay, whatever.

We ordered the fried zucchini that cost $2 during Happy Hour which was a nice little deal, but I didn't care for them since they tasted mostly like a slice of zucchini that wasn't even cooked long enough with a sad excuse of breading over it. The burgers were tasty and predictable of what you could expect from this chain, and cost about $10 each. 

Overall, skip this location and head to the Chandler location if you can. This spot definitely draws in a certain (Wally Word/hick) crowd, and it can definitely feel a tad uncomfortable if you're not used to it. The McDonalds in the Wal Mart across the street must have had a short line tonight."}
{"text":"Burgers are always awesome! Whiskey river is my favorite! Can't beat the endless fries.  I gave them four stars cause I hate long waits and sticky tables!"}
{"text":"I will not be returning to this location. 3 times they brought overcooked/burnt pretzels and jalopeno coins. I just couldnt believe the manager was ok with serving me burnt food 3 times and didnt even ask if he get me something else, all he said was he would remove the item from my check, then left me sitting there to watch my friend eat her burger, had to stop another waitress to order something. Worst service!"}
{"text":"The burgers are good but the prices are a bit high. The good news is all the sandwiches and wraps come with bottomless fries yeah! Ask for the fries with no salt and you will get them hot every time. Then you can add their fry seasoning yourself! They have new dipping sauces for the fries. Most are free but a few are \"premium\" meaning they cost $$$. We tried all the free ones and my favorite was the house sauce it was kind of like a thousand island. I haven't been to RR in a long time but when I use to go they would always bring a basket of fries while you waited for your food. So when we asked the server about this she told us \"we don't do that anymore you have to wait to get your meal first\" why???? Honestly I'm glad we had a gift card otherwise we probably wouldn't have gone. And for 80 bux for a party of 4 ehhhhh i think I'll pass next time!"}
{"text":"I wonder why I always go back here. The food is hit or miss and the service is always friendly but slow. The manager Bob is awful. Had an issue with my Royal Rewards( I had a free burger but did not want to use it) was told if I didn't use it I could not accumulate rewards for the visit. So when I agreed to use it they gave me the kids burger free. Very disappointed that he would rather make excuses than try and make it right. Will not be going back to this location. Hopefully the other locations will co continue to do right by loyal customers."}
{"text":"Newer Red Robin in Chandler, about 4 miles from I-10.  Nice shopping and other restaurants nearby.  Seated quickly, but the greeter may have taken some of our joking as applying to her as she was a little abrupt.  The server seemed very busy and mistook our drink orders and one soda apparently needed tank changed, but out our server pleasantly corrected the drinks.  

Meal was good and typical for Red Robin.  I had my usual Red Robin Royal burger.  The fries, like other RR's, were small orders and I was counting on the bottomless fries but by the time the next order arrived it was time to leave.  

Basically nice location, decent chain food, but service needs to be brought up a little bit more.  I did use the Red Robin Royalty Club to get a deal, so you might want to sign up for that if you go more frequently."}
{"text":"This is my husband's current favorite restaurant.  I enjoy it too, although burgers aren't my favorite thing.  They've got a variety of gourmet burgers to choose from.  Their burgers come with bottomless fries, which is a nice touch.  Their appetizers are really good too.  We usually get full after only a few bites of the burger because of the appetizers and bring the rest home to eat for lunch the next day.  

Great food for a small price!"}
{"text":"red robin? more like TRASH. just ordered my precious sandwich, estatic to get it, just to be told they forgot about it? is that how you treat your customers? wow. bottomless fries? more like bottomless disappointments. i'll be calling my lawyer."}
{"text":"Note to self: gross.  Great service and marketing to make me think that what I was getting would resemble good food.  I had the Banzai Salad and my wife had the grilled turkey burger.  Salad was a bunch of low quality lettuce with a microwaved thing that is supposed to be chicken.  Maybe this was $1 worth of food, and sold for $12.  Nice profit!  Turkey burger was undercooked, too spicy and ugly.  Bill was too high for food with no love."}
{"text":"My last several visits have definitely resulted in an improvement of my opinion of this location. It is clear that there has been emphasis on service. I will be back more frequently"}
{"text":"Was sorely disappointed with this location. I've been to Red Robins before and have always had stellar service. This location that was not the case. It took some time for a server to even acknowledge us. Once she did we at least got water quickly but that was the extent of it. Waited some time before she came back and took our order. I had the fish and chips and the oil used to fry both was definitely old. Both tasted stale and were very dry. I did not finish my fish. As far as \"endless\" fries are concerned they gave us very few to start with and only brought one refill. Had a milkshake that we had \"split\" which means they give you two child sizes for the price of a full one. Overall not impressed and will not return to this location."}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious as usual.  The bad part was that they took forever.  The fries were okay but not that great.  
The reasoning behind the two stars is the service was slow and our waitress was not very attentive because she had too many tables which I blame on the manager.  The place was crowded on a Friday at 5:30.  Too many screaming kids with inattentive parents were present. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought we were at Chucky Cheese.  Next time, we will opt for takeout."}
{"text":"My daughters salad a a dead fly within the lettuce!! Completely disgusting! The manager on duty, Rob acted as if it was no big deal! A simple sorry! 

Don't eat here! Totally gross!!!"}
{"text":"*Bless our young waiter who was freshly hired, for taking the blame at the time of this incident*

Experiencing an allergic reaction while dining out would be a first for me. Unfortunately, our waiter wasn't familiar with the menu the ingredients, nor was he familiar with who to ask for answers. But even MORE unfortunate, was that the ingredient list provided on the menu did not include every ingredient that my burger contained. This is the ingredient list provided for their Veggie burger: \"Our custom-blended, ancient-grain-and-quinoa veggie patty is piled high with Swiss cheese, lightly fried, Parmesan-sprinkled mushrooms, tomato bruschetta salsa, fresh avocado slices, sun-dried tomato spread and shredded romaine on a whole grain bun.\"

I ordered the Veggie burger after being told that the patty contained no beans/soy, as I am highly allergic. Our waiter stated that he confirmed this with another employee in the back. Trusting my waiter and the \"complete\" ingredient list on the menu, I was sooo excited that I qualified to eat it! Halfway through the burger, my throat began to close up. And I happened to spit out a fully formed bean, which was the result of my allergic reaction. Apparently, the Veggie patty consists of full formed beans, corn, AND quinoa. Not just quinoa. A truly scary experience, one moment I'm enjoying a flavorful meal then the next I can't breath... My sister couldn't finish her meal, as we had to rush to the nearest hospital for safety measures. So yeah, I would consider this a 1 star experience, and a valid reason to sue."}
{"text":"I expected a lot better servixe from this restaurant. My wife and I went out for dinner here. We were seated at the bar dinning area by a lady who works there. Real nice lady. We ordered a small order of onion rings and a wedge salad. Both where ok. Then we ordered our burgers which came out and I believe the Sonic hamburgers are just a little bit better than the ones we where served. Our waiter never came around to see what we needed. It was us and maybe 2 other couples in that area of the restaurant. We push the call server button on their table electronic thing because we wanted more fries. He never came but I would see him chatting up with his co-workers at the end of the bar and then chatting up again at the ent

rance while our little light kept flashing on their device. Fed up we got up to leave then he finally showed up and said he was sorry for the inconvenience. Yeah dude whatever I still left a tip but only $2. I called the restaurant to speak to a manager after we left pressed Option 4. And nobody ever answered. Won't go back again"}
{"text":"We had a very unhappy experience here this past weekend. When I got there, I put in for 2 adults and 2 children. I was told it would be a 20-30 min wait. After 45 minutes, we were called to be seated. The hostess (someone different than who we first spoke to) looked confused that we had 2 children with us. Turns out, they never marked the kids in the computer...we were going to be sat in the bar-area which doesn't allow children. They told us we would have to wait even longer. Since we were trying to catch a movie, we had to leave and eat at Taco Bell. Red Robin needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Probably the worst hamburger place I've ever been to. The floor throughout the whole place was filthy. Absolutely disgusting. Management should be embarrassed to allow patrons to see that. 
The two burgers we ordered looked nothing like the photos and didn't taste much better. 
The only positive to the place was the friendly server we had. 
Needless to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Our server was fantastic! I wish I remember her name it was very unique. She offered to give us fries while we waited for our meal which has never happened at any of the other Red Robin's I've been to in Phoenix!  The wife and I enjoyed Great burgers and dipping sauce! Will be coming to this location from now on!"}
{"text":"First off I love Red Robin! I've been to several locations across the country; including Virginia, Wisconsin, Illinois, California and Arizona. 

This Red Robin in Avondale is by far the worst. 
Maybe I just haven't had the right server yet. 
I'm not sure if this place has designated servers or if they just float around? 

The food is terrific no doubt, but the service is not all that great. I've been to this location roughly 7 times and every time I come it is a disappointment.  

Whenever you get your table you see the waitress/waiter they take your order they bring you your order and then you never see them again until it's time to pay. The servers are very polite and neat not knocking that. I only come to this location because it's the one closest to me but I think I might be traveling further to skip this one. 

I usually eat all my steak fries and order the special sauces. And this location claims bottomless fries but I always get to the bottom before I finished my burger. (Call me a fatty if you will, but if I'm going to indulge myself in these scrumptious carbohydrates with this awesome sauce then I will indulge myself once in a while.)

On the other hand I had the wedgie burger, and that my friends is amazing! I normally eat my burgers with a bun, but I wanted to go out on a limb here. What caught my eye was that the menu  says is a \"protein power house\".The avocado and bacon made this burger so much better! 

So if you are on the fence about trying this burger please try it you will be amazed.

Would love to give 5 stars but the service...eh
Hopefully you'll get better service than I do."}
{"text":"Upon walking up to the door the hostess open the door for me. I was escorted to my seat and had a waitress arrive they are very promptly. My server's name was Jamie she was awesome! I am a real team member so during your birthday month you get one free burger so I chose the wedge burger with campfire sauce and lemon poppyseed sauce. The burger was delicious and my waitress even helped me with the kiosk. And at the end of my meal she offered me a ice cream sundae for my birthday! I spoke with the manager and told her that this was one of the best red Robin visits I've had! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice before and service was terrible.  Waiting for a table for 30 mins or longer when tables were open, was unacceptable!  People who arrived after us were seated before us, same seating preference and number in party.  
Yesterday, their service was awesome!  For a party of 7, we were seated immediately with no hassle.  Our server was Tony and he made the evening enjoyable.  He was very attentive and personable.  With the crew yesterday, I would gladly return to this location."}
{"text":"Great service, OK food for a chain.  Fiance hated the shredded lettuce on his cheeseburger, I was pretty happy with the blackened chicken sammy I had. $5 sam adams, little pricey considering it's nothing special. Fries are really yummy. If you are in a hurry in this area this is a decent choice.  Pretty decent salad options, too, if you are watching your diet.

My biggest complaint is that my table and menu were kinda sticky, which is par for the course at chain restaurants.."}
{"text":"A great lunch or dinner place w/ casual but friendly service.  Server Jake was very accomodating, fast and efficient.  Definitely a place we like to keep coming back to again and again. Tha convenient location is great too."}
{"text":"First I must say our server Charlie was AMAZING!!  He was super nice, very helpful and gave great service.  He went on and above to make sure our meal and experience was good.  My friend and I got the crispy chicken sandwich on wheat buns and they were really yummy!  Obviously because it is a chain it isn't going to be 5 star food but it was pretty good!  My hubby got the BBQ burger and he loved it!  The fries were hot and plentiful!  I love dipping them in the buzzard sauce and ranch.  yum!  Because its my hubby's birthday month he got an ice cream sunday.  I am always super full when I leave Red Robin and the food is consistant."}
{"text":"I have to say this food chain has really gone down hill.  Burgers are tiny but they charge a premium.  Mine tasted like a McDonalds burger.  Honestly you could get a better bigger burger at the local bar establishment for half the price.  My food was served cold.  Sweet potato fries were terrible compared to other places I've had them.  I really have nothing good to say.  If you are over 18 you should pick a different place to go to dinner."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming to this Red Robin every Sunday after church! Our favorite server is Taylor! He has a wonderful personality and his service has always been on point. The food has always been pretty good and if there is ever anything wrong they are quick to correct it. Food has always come out fast and fresh. They are quick to give you refills on French fries and drinks. The manager always comes by our table to make sure we are taken care of which is nice. I base my ratings on the type of establishment it is, Red Robin being a popular burger franchise originating out of Seattle. Compared to chili's, BWW, Applebee's , etc Red Robin is definitely 4 stars... Well, at least this Red Robin."}
{"text":"My family, friends & I love this place. They have great customer service, friendly staff. Love the sandwiches, shakes and drinks mostly the fries & shakes our kids love. Whenever we dine here we also ALWAYS have Togo for later on snacks."}
{"text":"I mean, it's a chain restaurant. They all taste pretty similar. This location is not anything special. 

This one happens to be closest to our home. 

We eat here every so often. My little brother loves their Red Robin Royal burger, and I'm a fan of the clucks and fries. 

They have a reasonable beer selections, and they rotate it often enough that we can try something new. 

I also love that their broccoli is not bottomless like their fries."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch because. So glad we did ! Their customer service was excellent. Our was waitress  checking on us through out meal. For appetizers we had onion rings and I had the small blue cheese wedge salad. The onions rings were great most are but it was their sauces that came with them that made them special. !! My blue cheese wedge salad was super fresh and had these thin crispy onions surrounding it that were delicious!. When our food came out it wasn't warm. Our waitress took it offering to bring us fries while we waited. The the manager came back with our food  apologizing. Then another employee not sure of his position came by to see if everything was OK!! So nice! We will definitely be back when we're in Mesa again."}
{"text":"This is how Red Robin should always taste! We came on opening week so I know they were on their A game. We were seated at the bar. I was pleasantly surprised to see some non-crap beers on their menu :) our waitress was great! She was super sweet and knowledgable. I ordered my burger with no mayo and I actually saw her write it down. For the first time in a long time I had complete confidence that my order would come out correctly, and boy it sure did! Her name was Kadie Lee and insure hope we get her next time! Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Went with a big group and the service was pretty fast. Burger was well cooked, bottomless fries are always a bonus. A little hard to find because Tempe marketplace is so large, but that may just be a problem for me since I'm not native to the area."}
{"text":"Just very blah. Took a while to get drinks. Uncozy atmosphere. Everyone running and not listening to the order. 
Burger came lukewarm like it's been sitting somewhere for a bit. Had to keep reminding the waitress to bring \"bottomless\" fries. Too loud with babies crying. Most likely never again category"}
{"text":"I just went to Red Robin a few months ago. When I walked in I realized WHY I had never been there. It's a family friendly joint - so you never know when little junior will start screaming or running through the aisles. Thankfully, that only happens about 20% of the time I'm there, probably because I'm there on weekdays for lunch.

I have to admit though, they have consistently good food. Not creative, just basic stuff, but tasty. The salads in particular are really great (and I'm picky about lettuce and salad dressings). Plus they'll bring you fries for free - all ya have to do is ask :-) 

My co-workers won't let me stop going, but then again I don't fight them too hard."}
{"text":"The service here is awesome! We were promptly sat by Amanda who was very friendly and welcoming. Our server Nicole was very sweet made our experience great."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars because it's a good Red Robin overall, with one exception.  Very friendly waitress, ample parking and easy to find, and I used a birthday coupon for a free burger.  

BUT.....as a hamburger fan I have to tell you that if you serve a bun that cracks and breaks up while you are eating it then it's too old to serve.

Other than that, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I have a go to dish I try everywhere I go.  That's the chicken tender salad, unfortunately, Red Robin doesn't add very much to it, so i usually ask for the Avo-Cobb-o with crispy chicken.  It's very tasty and worth every bite.  Their chicken is not too crispy nor too floppy.  The salads vegetables are fresh tasting and just swirl together for a fun taste.  I know this is a chain, but since it's close to my home- it's a good catch all for everyone.  I also enjoy reaping the Red Robin loyalty points.  I enjoy when a restaurant can give back to it's returning customers."}
{"text":"Had a fun time at Red Robin in Tempe.  Had the banzai burger w/fries... can't go wrong with any of the burgers or the endless fries!"}
{"text":"I like the food and service. The only thing it is a bit pricey.  However you get what you pay for. It is a nice atmosphere without a lot of noise.  They have a great salad bar.  The tvs  are a bit to small but always have the game on. I don't like the fact that they quit serving their cheddar cheese biscuits in Arizona.  Who's idea was that?????  That brought my rating from a 5 to a 4 star."}
{"text":"My usual RR location and is typically pretty good. I've also had little to know wait here, even when it is busy. 

The food itself is just like any other Red Robin. I usually order the Clucks and Fries or the Whiskey River BBQ chicken burger with pineapple! Both come with their bottomless steak fries. Usually the food is good and if it isn't, simply ask for something new and they usually take it off your bill. 

I've only had one bad experience here with the service. A waitress was very rude and grouchy to the point where we spoke to the manager and got a new waitress. The manager was nice and also gave us a free stack of onion rings. 

Keep in mind this is a large chain restaurant so don't expect it to be a fancy place with gourmet food. It's what you'd expect out of RR"}
{"text":"I will be coming again and again. Your wait staff is excellent! Bar Tender knows how to make mixed drinks. Your food is delicious and Finally the place is clean and decorated very nicely."}
{"text":"Just your normal burger joint. It's great to go if you have children. It's definitely children friendly. I really like their avocado chicken con salad. I order mine without the bacon and eggs and it becomes a healthy delicious salad while everyone is eating a burger"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today and Maryann was fantastic! Not only did she have great recommendations she was super friendly while continuing to get all the drink orders out. The restaurant was packed and she managed to take really great care of her customers and handle her drink orders. Violet was also super friendly and helpful. The staff here is on point."}
{"text":"Burger was good and they offer the bottomless fries thing. It's odd that you have to go pick them up yourself though. The restaurant was 10% full on a Monday night yet I couldn't get a fry refill through the waitress. I had to walk up to the expediters line in the kitchen and pick it up myself. Doesn't encourage me to come back soon. Who am I kidding, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is always good but their \"bottomless fires\" consist of getting about 6 fries at a time. Apparently budgets must have gotten more tight over the last couple of years."}
{"text":"I love red robin and have to drive over an hour to get to our nearest locations. My fiancé and I visited this location shortly after 9pm. It took awhile for the server to find us 
 We got our drinks and our app of onion rings, and some fries early. Then we waited and waited and saw our food in the window since we were looking straight into the kitchen. 

Yes we both said its our order. 9 minutes our food sat in the window before arriving at our table.  Considering I had quac on my burger That wasn't good. She has onion crisps on her burger that were cold from the wait time. It's so hard to find good servers and ones that pay attention to the table ."}
{"text":"Skeptical service has improved and our food was cooked perfectly.our server honestly was perfect and that proves I was completely wrong from when she approached our table and I had my doubts. Fresh fries brought out early upon request and my peach tea w lemon was amazing and refills were brought before we even asked. 

My burger was cooked well and toppings were good. My fiancé chicken bbq was also crisp and tasty. We only wish the service and food quality was this good every visit. Please come to niles/ boardman area"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and normally have a pleasant time. However, this time we had a waitress that was slow and we had to keep asking for more \"endless\" fries and refills on drinks. It is much better when the waitress is paying attention. It would not have been bad, but the restaurant was slow and should not have been that way. 

The food was still tasty. I got the A-1 peppercorn and it was very good. Just wish the service would have been what we were used to there."}
{"text":"It took 45 minutes for this Red Robin to bring our table our food. My burger was RAW, not the \"some pink\" as the waitress says. My father in law wanted his well done and his was pink, my wife asked for medium,hers was well done. I complained because my buger still had the texture of raw meat and it took 15 more minutes for a replacement to show up. Come on guys, it's burgers, not rocket science."}
{"text":"I'm sorry Red Robin just isn't that good; the staff here is very nice but the food is just not yummy; I just got the grilled cheese and it was already hard when it came out and the sweet potatoes fries were cold.  I just can't recommend it to anyone and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The food is always fantastic. Our \"some pink\" burgers were fairly pinkless, which is the only thing keeping me from giving them the 5th star. Everything was awesome otherwise!"}
{"text":"The bacon cheese burger with egg on it??? Royal burger it's called. It was sooooo good. Freckles lemonade was delicious! They have great pretzels too. Fun environment. The kids love it! Red Robin yum"}
{"text":"From eating at other valley locations of Red Robin, we expected much better.  The place has been quite busy since opening, that's good for the brand.  I'll bet as people visit, they'll opt for another restaurant next time, I know we sure will.
     Mid afternoon on a Saturday and because there were only 2 of us, they sat us at a bar table with high bar stools that were quite uncomfortable. (Should've said something about the table, but I let it go....) Had we been a larger party, perhaps we'd have been seated at a regular table or booth.
     Sat a few minutes and read the menu, our server came over to offer apps and booze, we just wanted some lunch.   We ordered since we were ready.  Our 2 cokes came out pretty fast, as you'd think.  
     Then, we waited, and waited and waited (25-30 minutes) for our order.  Both of our were way overcooked...mine was downright singed/burnt.  I had a patty melt, he had a Bonsai Burger. The pineapple on his was not grilled and tasted like the tin can it came out of.  My patty melt was grilled so long the rye bread was too hard to eat - just ate the insides and left the hard grilled rye on the plate. 
     After we about half way thru eating, our server check in to see if all was OK which was good.  The bathroom needed attention and the 'guy in charge' was ordering people around, but missing an awful lot of what was really needing his attention.  
     We will most likely try them again, everyone deserves a second chance.  They just need improvements in a few areas."}
{"text":"Okay so I don't even know why we came back here. As soon as I walked in, I remembered why it's been forever since I've came back to this location. No hostess greeting, and when she finally does come out, she made us feel bad and pressured since we were 20 minutes to closing. Look I understand it is annoying when someone comes in when it's almost closing time but we were in a rush anyways. We would've ordered, eaten and left within those 20 minutes. But to make a guest feel bad that \" you have to order fast\" wow. Super super horrible service. The experience begins within the first \"hello\" upon entering any restaurant. So it's just really disappointing for this restaurant to place extremely rude people to be the first impression. Good luck. Because your food is amazing, but your hostess' are putting a bad name to your restaurant."}
{"text":"I LOVE Red Robins steak fries soooo much!!...dipped in ranch dressing...of course. Always great service at this location too!!"}
{"text":"I've went to multiple Red Robin burger joints before, my burgers always dry and/or cold, and they've messed up my order on several occasions."}
{"text":"After a long hiatus, we revisited this Red Robin. Our food was good, but the service is what stood out. Our waitress was great and very friendly. She checked in on us several times and made sure everything was good. All in all it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Don't get the pretzel bites, they were horrible. They were deep fried and the cheese was watery.

My salad was very good!"}
{"text":"Burgers only are a great idea. Ask for bottled anything. Drinking from a glass or eating off a glass plate looks risky so great idea that they have disposable plates/paper instead. The 3 stars are because the flavor of burger was decent and the staff was decent and adorable. Just pray over their dishwashing machine! Whew..."}
{"text":"Great food for a large corporate burger chain. The portions are large, their sauces are great. Love the onion rings and the burgers are delicious. The prices are reasonable as well. Service is on point. Never have to wait too long for a refill on drinks or the bottomless fries. Overall...great place to dine."}
{"text":"I was in one week night with my husband, and we were very disappointed.  The all you can eat French fries were cold, a small plate of about 23 and come on! The waitress didn't know the weight of the burger patties before grilling. The 6.99 burgers are so small ...when you upgrade to 8.99 ha ha ha. So basically if you are hungry go somewhere else"}
{"text":"The location at the Galleria certainly gets a lot of traffic but they still get parties seated quickly.

They have those neat little tablets at the table where you can order and pay, which is cool.  Unfortunately, the servers seems to be slow and hard to find.  It took forever for anything to come out and refills were hard to come by.

Mind you, this was around 3 or 4 on a Sunday - the place was about half full.  Maybe.

Food was fine; tastes like any other Red Robin.  So I guess that's a plus.

Stick to the one off Eastern and Serene."}
{"text":"took my sis and the kids here for a quick bite after shopping and i was very disappointed.

The location is like any other RR in cleanliness and atmosphere, your basic family friendly sports bar.. but this visit was just terrible.

The waiter forgot half the stuff we ordered, brought mixed up sides, and a wrong dish all together... took forever and then the manager came and corrected everything after we had to wait...

We were very specific about a couple of things, like the temperature
 for the little ones food and it was ignored.

Dining with little ones is always an adventure no matter what you do, so it helps if the staff understands and does their best to make the process painless.

I probably won't come back here."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this location about a year.
Never had a bad experience. Staff is always friendly 
Salads are great 
Burgers are top notch
Always have a nice time in the bar watching TV and having an ice cold beer!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here last evening at 5:20 pm.  First the hostess left a line of people because her shift was done and the next person wasn't on duty yet.  Next we got seated.  Waited 15 minutes and were never even approached by a waiter.   In the area we were seated was probably 4 tables that hadn't been bused.   We walked out.  What a joke.   Would not recommend this location, even if t hat gave your dinner for free.  Red Robin should close it if can't staff or manage it properly.  One star because I couldn't choose none."}
{"text":"I always just sit in the bar area so I can get in and get out. The best ting I like is the bottomless root beer floats. The only reason I'm not giving them more stars is that the bosses are a bunch liberals that are gun haters. Even though they post the gun free zone I go in and eat. But I'd rather have my gun so I don't frequent them much."}
{"text":"I really loved this Red Robin chain. It has a very friendly atmosphere. My waitress was fun to chat with and she always checked in frequently to see if we needed anything. I ordered pretzel bites with cheese for the appetizer. It was so good. The cheese was gooey and melty. It also did not taste like nacho cheese which was what I was expecting. It tastes like pure cheddar cheese which I loved! For my entree I had the the prime chophouse burger. It had a nice kick due to the horseradish mayo. It also came with a nice onion ring on top. O had mine with their steak fries. And if you think they don't give a lot of fries no worries the fries are bottomless. Also after eating one of their burgers you won't be able to finish the fries they gave you. If you want a smaller burger you should get a tavern burger. Also although they are known for their burgers they have sandwiches and other entrees too."}
{"text":"Although I ordered through Postmates and a portion of the responsibility for this review belongs to them, Red Robin also failed to uphold their end as well. 

As mentioned I ordered through Postmates, and included a few special requests to make my meal vegetarian-friendly (no bacon, no chili, BOCA patties, etc.), to which Postmates & Red Robin paid no attention. We got our meal and bacon. was. on. everything. The cheese fries were covered in chili and everything was missing ranch, salads included (how is that okay??).

I don't know if the staff just felt like doing their own thing or if they thought I was joking about the no meat thing, but I'm so disappointed, $50 down the drain."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar area for lunch on this fine rainy Saturday. Ordered our burgers, and took 30 minutes to get our food - which the manager brought out. Burger was cold. Fried were cold.  \"Gourmet burgers and beer\" with only 8 beers on tap. Not impressed."}
{"text":"We've been here several times before, but this last time was terrible.   The other times have been ok.  This past Saturday evening we waited an hour for a table.   We had six in a our party.  It was a dinner for my mom's birthday.   Once we finally got seated.  It took another hour to get our food and the place had numerous open tables.  Why so long for food?   The table felt greasy and my silverware was dirty.  When the food was served, my son's order was wrong and he had to wait even longer.   Very underwhelming experience for overpriced burgers!  Will be a long time before we come back to this location."}
{"text":"I picked this Red Robin for a reunion dinner with an old friend I hadn't seen in seven years and it couldn't have gone better. As we came from different ends of the Valley we agreed meet and as I arrived first I was offered to be put on the waiting list immediately. Thus when my friend arrived we were seated almost right away. The waiter was informative (he knew the menu) and once we ordered the food arrived quickly. My burger was spectacular although the endless fries policy resulted in more than the two of us could eat. And I and my friend caught up on old times we were not pressured to move on as I have experienced elsewhere. A perfect evening! I will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I did alot of walking while shopping at the Galleria Mall. We stopped in for a couple of beers at the bar. No one else was at the bar as it was early afternoon. Gal at the bar acted as if we were imposing on her. Typical corporate muppet attitude. Lost a future customer as a result."}
{"text":"Must preface this review with the fact this was my third visit and none of the previous visits deserved a review...good or bad. Chatty staff, below average food and noisy environ undeserving! Until now; the Smoke & Pepper Signature Burger is a dam fine burger but let's first note the Tower of Onion Rings which are memorable. Dipping sauces not so much but they don't need any help. And remember to save one of those rings for your burger. 

Ordered my S&P medium with crisp bacon which was grilled to perfection! I added that remaining ring for additional crunch...delicious!

The fries are similar to the ring dipping sauce...forgettable! Surprising considering they're target market is the burger segment. 

Almost felt like a grown up burger joint! Worthy of another visit......."}
{"text":"Went there last night. The service and food were both excellent! I ordered a burger but no one asked me how I wanted it cooked. When I got it it was more rare than I wanted so i politely let the server know. They immediately cooked me a brand new burger and brought me another round of my side veggies and a complimentary soup for my friend. Great service, friendly, and efficient."}
{"text":"Bottomless Freckled Lemonade! Free refills! Must get every time you go!

The place gets packed on a weekend. Their Royal Red Robin burger is definitely one of my favorite. Burger with fried egg!
If you love guacamole, get their Guacamole burger. I love this place because you can basically make your own burgers! You can add guac to your royal red robin or you can add fried egg to your guac burger!

Oh, their fries are awesome! Use the seasoning they provide to add some taste. The fries are bottomless as well!

And they serve you the burger with half of it wrapped already. It's clean and easy to eat (especially if you are one of those that's too lazy to wash your hands)."}
{"text":"Solid place for comfort food!  As the name says, RR serves burgers and fries and drinks.  I was extra hungry and craving something warm and tasty and easy, so RR fit the bill.  My Whiskey Jack BBQ chicken burger was yummy and gone within minutes and my steak fries were satisfyingly thick and salty and starchy.  (Bottomless fries!!)  We also got the red velvet cake which wasn't too bad for something taken out of the freezer.  While RR would not be my usual choice for dinner fare, it was fun and close by and convenient.  If you have picky friends, this place would be appealing and \"safe.\""}
{"text":"Good quality burger.  Too long a wait for service.  The price was too high for the quality of burger and with the competition of in and out right down the street I won't go back often off ever.  Had the guac turkey burger good buns and decent guac.   Wasn't impressed but not disappointed.  In and out for me. Try something different"}
{"text":"Really good service today thank you team @ red Robbins. Thanks again Katie for the fast refills on fries and soda."}
{"text":"Tables were sticky, asked the waitress to if she could please wipe it off. She disregarded, we  asked for a washcloth to wipe the table our selves,she said she'd get us one. We did it ourselves. Air conditioning was blowing full blast by the north window seats. Carpets were filthy. Container brought with coffee was empty of sugar. Bathrooms were disgusting, tissue and urine all over the floor...cheese on burger was not melted and hard...
Yuck!! Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"We are extremely disappointed in the service that we had tonight! We had to wait an hour for our food !!! We sat @ the bar & I got fed up & told my husband to get it to go! There wasn't enough help obviously! Had a nicer experience @ home on our porch watching the sunset than watching the slow help! Food is great like the Cabo Avo salad! But the service here needs to step up to the PLATE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The burgers are overpriced but the unlimited fries are nice. I'm not one for the whole \"gourmet\" burger scene. I grill better burgers than I can buy. If I'm jonesing for a sub-par burger, a Whopper from Burger King suffices and it's a quarter the price. The atmosphere is chaotic but the kids love it so I'll bump it a star.  If I had to compare it against Five Guys and Fuddruckers, I'd say Five Guys burgers taste the best, Fuddruckers gives you the best customization, and Red Robin is a blase third place."}
{"text":"We've been to this location a couple of times and I agree with some of the lack of cleanliness comments, but my wife and her friend showed up for lunch today and ended up going to a different restaurant.

The overhead music was so loud when they first walked in that the hostess couldn't even hear their request to turn down the volume.  They told her that they were going to leave and go to another restaurant, and the hostess simply acknowledged the comment and didn't bother to ask if there was a problem.

This location is apparently doing well enough to not have to worry about consistency with cleanliness or loud music at lunch - there are plenty of other choices in the area and they don't have to also worry about not having repeat business."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for years, and today I was pleasantly surprised. I wish I had taken a picture of my salad for you, and now it's too late. I promise next time I will! My friend had a burger off the Tavern list, and I had the avo-cabo salad, dressing on side. Our food looked pretty, was really fresh, and delivered on time. My salad came will 4 deliteful toasted bread slices. I only ate one as I'm watching every carb and sugar, and it was yummy! My ice tea went missing, and when it finally showed up there just was almost no ice, hence one less star! Shame on the server!
The atmosphere is OK, visually nothing too crazy, we sat in the bar, and our seats were OK in our booth. I wish the noise level was a little more quiet. The noise from one or two uber unhappy children travelled the whole restaurant. (Dear parent next time please remove your darling from the restaurant.) We decided we will be back as we liked the food and the lower calorie options! Thanks Red!"}
{"text":"Angie and I wanted to try something new, and Red Robin was forever on the someday list. So we held our breath and dived in.
   The menu is very large. It is a burger joint.  But there is a huge variety of burgers and barbeque, chicken, even salads.
   Our waitress was very outgoing. Her knowledge of the menu made our visit much easier and helped us to a better selection.  
   Angie loved the Southern Charm burger, brown sugar, sweet bacon and cheese!? Nice! The surprise was substituting mac and cheese for fries. The mac and cheese is phenomenal. I had the teriyaki chicken, it was good, but not my forever sandwich, will try something else next time. Angie liked the chili cheese fries we had as an appetizer, though really we had so much to eat, appetizer was an afterthought.  
   The chain has great selections, inviting dining room design, so...we will return!"}
{"text":"This place was great, food was all I could ask for.  I got the tavern burger.  Just enough with out being too much.  Match with a great craft beer and we have a winner.  But then, the staff is great too being helpful to us out of towners.  We'll done RR!"}
{"text":"Okay. You know what to expect. The service was great.  Burger quality is slightly above fast food which is disappointing since one is paying for a premium burger experience.  Less on bottomless fries, more on quality/fresh beef plz"}
{"text":"My wife and I have not had a single negative experience at this Red Robin. Even if we don't get our preferred booth, we still enjoy ourselves because the servers and the food are both excellent as a combo. Samantha and David are always speedy with everything from refilling drinks to making sure our food comes out at appropriate times since we normally order an appetizer with dinner. I can't recall the name of this guy who's normally taking care of the bar area, but we were grateful to him for giving us two cards for appetizers on our next visit because we realized that we picked the wrong type of appetizer. We didn't have to ask and we didn't make it seem like it was his fault-- Still he was kind enough to make up for our own mistake by giving us something to look forward to for next time. (Yes we got the right appetizer the next visit!) All of the servers are great folks who do their job amazingly well/fast and they are the biggest reason we come to this location specifically. We always leave a survey because they deserve the praise and so much more.

Forgot to add this part in earlier on! The staff recognizes us and have a damn good memory of what we order too, so honestly it's nice to be remembered and it's sweet of them to ask how we've been if they haven't seen us in a long time."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with Red Robin (insert yummmm). This location in Downtown Summerlin is beautiful! Sparkling clean, everyone was friendly, pleasant, and warm. Now, I do think that in the years that have passed since I last visited a Red Robin, that the portion sizes have gotten smaller (especially that initial serving of fries), but the taste is pretty much still the same. 

I also want to compliment their restrooms (yes, I know that's weird). I don't think I've been in a public restroom that is cleaner! That says a lot to me- there's nothing worse than going into a nasty bathroom! 

Anyway, burgers, fries, friendly service, clean, and reasonably priced- Red Robin does it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered delivery from Grubhub from here.  He got the A-1 burger and i got the Whiskey BBQ burger add avocado.  I am a vegetarian so I LOVE that you can sub a veggie patty in any burger from here.  The veggie burger was absolutely delicious, I recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet, savory and slightly tangy burger...so good!  The boxes include instructions on how to reheat the fries so that they will be just as good as you would get in the restaurant, and they include packets of the Red Robin seasoning.  I would have given this experience 5 stars but, we also got the pretzel bits with cheese as an appetizer and they were so salty I couldn't even eat them.  My boyfriend ate a few before coming to the same conclusion.  I love Red Robin and pretty much everything from there but they were a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"Food:  4 out of 5 Stars
Server:  1 out of 5 stars
Cook:  3 out of 5 stars

Went here with 4 co-workers for lunch to try out their Tavern Burger Twosday Special.  The deal is that you buy one burger and 2 soft drinks and get a Tavern Burger free (or a $6.99 discount if you order a more expensive burger).  

We were the VERY FIRST TABLE seated,  right at 11am as 2 of my coworkers had noon meetings.  We placed our orders at 11:05 and it wasn't until 11:30 that 2 baskets of fries hit our table.  They were quickly devoured.  

At exactly 11:40 our burgers arrived and my 2 co-workers started to race to finish so they could get back to work.  3 of us had ordered the Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double which was supposed to have raw and deep fried jalapeño's on it.  They came with a small amount of 'bottomless fries' in each basket.  I had ordered some buffalo wing sauce to come with my fries but I wish I had ordered ranch.  Our waitress was no-where to be found.  A few times she popped over to other tables but at no time did she stop back over to see if everything was ok or if she could get us anything.  Are we supposed to use the 'table monsters' to get her attention?  I'd MUCH PREFER if she just stopped back to check in.  after I had eaten about half my burger I decided to look inside.  There were no deep fried jalapeño's.  Not in mine or the other 2 at my table.  After hailing the waitress and asking her about it- she had the manager come over with 3 tiny serving cups of peppers and said, \"Oh, sorry guys.  My cook forgot to put them on there.\"  We were the first table in there, his very first order of 5 EASY burgers and he can't even get them right?  I asked the manager for more fries for the table and a co-worker asked her for a refill on his sweet tea.  Right away she brought over fries then brought over an unsweetened tea.  When he said he wanted a Sweetened Tea she went back to the kitchen and had the waitress bring out the correct one.  Is THIS the way Red Robin does lunch?

When it came time to pay, the waitress seemed bothered that we didn't know how to use the 'table monster' and even more annoyed when 2 of us wanted to pay with cash.  This is how they get tipped, correct?  On SERVICE, correct?  I've had better service at York Chinese Buffet."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this chain, I really did... but after disappointing visits to the Mt Lebanon location (soggy fries in greasy drippy paper cones), to Settlers Ridge where we were the first table seated but it still took almost 40 minutes to get our burgers and even then they missed the most important ingredient of my Ghost Pepper Style Burger (then delivered it in a portion cup on the side) to my most recent visit to this Waterworks/Homestead one- I GIVE UP...!  

First off- it was a Tuesday evening and it wasn't crowded.  We were seated pretty quickly and offered menu's by the hostess.  The waitress came by a second or 2 later and asked us if we were ready to order.  WHAT?  We didn't even get drinks yet.  We told her we were going to look over the menu but could she please get us 2 tall Coors Light drafts.  Seeing the bar from our table I noticed that there wasn't a bartender behind it.  There wasn't any customers seated there so I guess that's 'protocol'.  Anyway, our waitress goes away with our drink order and goes behind the waitress station to put our order in.  She comes back about 10 minutes later ( after my wife & I each alternately used the washroom & washed up) and asks if we're ready to order yet.  I ask her if they're still doing the Tavern Tuesday Deal and she says \"No, they stopped that weeks ago\" which I know is a lie because I get the e-mails every Tuesday Morning.  I asked her about our drinks and she says, \"I have no idea what's taking your drinks so long...\" which I reply, \"It's probably because you don't have a bartender over there...\"  She shakes her head and walks away.  Still no movement over to the bar so I get up & walk over there myself.  No one seems to notice me and just as I am prepared to grab 2 glasses off the bartop to fill them myself- a Bartender appears...!  She asks if she can help me and I tell her I'm at a table 'over there' and \"...I've been waiting for beers for over 15 minutes with an empty bar...\"  She pours my beers and I return to the table.  The waitress comes by about 5 minutes later, sees the beers, doesn't say a word, and keeps walking.  Our burgers come out about 10 minutes later, accompanied by their 'bottomless fries' which amount to 9 fries on my wife's plate (in a silly cone) and 11 on mine.  WTH...?  I immediately requested a second batch.  At least at the Settlers Ridge location- they brought out the fries when they were ready and didn't leave them sit there to get cold & soggy while the burgers cooked.  

This experience was another Red Robin let-down... You just can't get it right... 3 visits... 3 Strikes... You're out.  I'm sorry that it has to be like this as I LOVE hamburgers...

Btw. Our visit was on Nov 10 if anyone cares..."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I must admit I was a bit skeptical being my first time going to a place that served $10.00 or more hamburgers but I was very impressed. The service was on point, the restaurant was clean and neat. My food arrived fast and hot. I ordered the blue cheese burger and steak fries. My girlfriend ordered the Hawaiian burger and steak fries. They were each around $10.00 a piece and worth every cent. Cooked perfectly medium and the fries were also right. I asked for more fries and had two more orders on my table before I knew it. Free refills on fries and free ranch dipping sauce. I felt very satisfied as I was leaving the restaurant. I would definitely recommend Red Robin to my friends and family. I look forward to my return to Red Robin."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The kitchen staff are loud and obnoxious. Very rude and crude. I would not sit anywhere near that area."}
{"text":"I came here alone today to get some delicious clucks and fries. The waitresses here are very nice, if you're ever looking for acceptance and delicious bottomless steak fries, this is the place. My favorite Red Robin's!"}
{"text":"Our server seemed too rush to give us proper service. We sat for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us what we wanted to drink. Food took awhile coming out and wasn't great. Burger was mushy because it was doused in sauce and they don't serve you enough of those bottomless fries at a time. Tasted my daughters grilled cheese that looked sad and tasted bland. The fruit they gave her looked old and the artichoke dip wasn't good. We were never once asked if we wanted a drink refill and server kept forgetting things like napkins and a side of coke slaw we ordered. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying something
I am proud of coming up with; Red Robin is the Applebee's of the Southwest. It took probably 10 minutes to get a seat, which was pretty good considering how busy it was. When we got our table, there was no silverware or napkins, and my daughter's kids menu was written in Spanish. It took 15 minutes before a waiter even acknowledged our existence! The food came pretty quick, and it was decent. I ordered a refill, and it didn't come until after we were done and paid, so I had to send it back! When I asked for more ranch, they said they were \"out of ranch\" and \"were MAKING more\" and when we asked for more fries, we had to wait for those for a considerable amount of time (very stupid considering it's a restaurant that thrives on burgers and fries, and probably should always have fresh batches ready. And I garuntee there will be at least 2 kids screaming/crying/running around AT ALL TIMES. You would be better off at a fast food chain than here, and it would be cheaper too."}
{"text":"Dining in is great.  Everyone is always nice and helpful. 
Carry out is awful. The online system has glitches, the wait is long when you arrive at the time of pick up and the customer service is poor, even by management. 
You don't feel like they are providing their service; they treat you like you're bothering them with a carry out order."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I had a better experience at tempe. The waiter was hardly there and when he brought out my appetizer he also brought out 2 small plates my plate was dirty, you could see oil and fingerprints. I told him I needed a new plate so he brought me one. We ordered when our food came out again you could see the fingerprints on the plate. Talk about unsanitary.  Took one bite and I couldn't continue eating. I called for the manager  he was the worse I explained the situation and he said how else are they suppose to hold the plate!!! I've worked in a restaurant before and what he told me was completely insane.   The  to go box had oil and fingerprints all over it. He said they use gloves to get the box and  then he said they didn't and to top it off he didn't apologized. Never again."}
{"text":"I love burgers, I mean who doesn't, maybe except vegetarians?

My husband and I decided to go out and get a burger, we were up in the happy valley area on our way to dick's sporting goods, so we droped in here to fulfill our burger urges. They have so many to choose from it takes a few minutes to get through the menu. They also offer and endless amount of french fries and refills. 

I can't remember what the name of the burger was I ordered, but I can tell you it had guac, and Bacon on it. The burgers can be ordered two different ways, pink or not pink. It seems like this place is really flexible on how the meals can be ordered. They do have on the menu I think one burger without bun, but you can order any burger they have \"protein style\". I ordered mine \"protein style\" which just means instead of a bun you have your's wrapped in lettuce. Also I substituted the endless fries with a side order of a salad. We didn't wait very long before being served our meals. 
Once I got my burger and salad I macked it down.. It was pretty good. I gave this place 4 stars instead of 3 because of the flexibility in their menu."}
{"text":"Top notch burger, the old fashioned way with a sesame seed bun. All the ingredients were fresh and blended perfectly. Forget all the other mediocre chains (jack in the box, In and Out, Whataburger, etc.) and come here - and get a great beer too."}
{"text":"I had a family of 11 come in, for a after graduation dinner . It was late I called and when I got there our table was ready. I was very happy and service was on point. I was very pleased that even though it was as almost 9pm they accommodate our big family. And Red Robin is our go to burger place."}
{"text":"The Madison Monona location is a joke, sent back my burger 2x and they still couldn't get it right.  The manager ended up comping the entire party of 3 because he realized how screwed up his staff was."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome Gluten Free guacamole bacon burger and fries; even comes in a yellow 'allergy' basket - great knowledgeable server; so nice to have a burger on a bun!! Heaven..."}
{"text":"The food and the service were good, but all of the plates and silverware given to us were so dirty. You can tell that they really didn't care match about the cleanliness of the place. I honestly wouldn't go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"Worst service ever at Red Robin. Burger was good, but after food was dropped off, the waiter Andre, disappeared from our life. Turned the call waiter light on to get refill on water and fries. Everyone ignored the light, although staff walked by every 30 seconds or so, for 25 minutes,the the waiter can back with our bill and said ' do you want anything else?' I told him not any more and he said 'sorry bout thay' and walked away. May never go back."}
{"text":"This is our second time coming to this location and I have to say that our first experience was the best. Overall it's still a reasonable spot to dine in. I would recommend coming here for lunch not dinner. 

The food is average although the last time we came we enjoyed their parmesan fries so I ordered it again only to find out they changed the recipe it was better before. They also say us in the back which at the time obviously had 1 server assisting multiple guests. Almost a hour into our meal no refills and honestly it wasn't the servers fault he was slammed. I had to walk up to the front to get someone to help us. 

At the end of our meal we where able to speak with a manager named Ron he was very apologetic about the experience we had and took care of us."}
{"text":"Above average, good food selection, decent prices, can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"This location is busy, busy, busy on a Friday night, which is a good sign! I went here with my mom after attending a play! Despite how busy they were, they asked for my phone number and texted me when our table was ready! Neat. We were seated in about fifteen minutes which is great, because we received a text that the wait would be twenty! They sat us at high top tables near the bar! I wish that we had the opportunity to communicate whether we preferred to be seated at a regular table (my mom is handicapped) but again, they were busy! 
My high top chair wobbled the entire time which was annoying, but our table was clean. 
Our server was very sweet and attentive! 
She checked on us several times throughout our visit and remembered everything. I noticed that they use a lot of team work and that there were a few others who came by to ensure everything was satisfactory as well. This place was exactly what I expected minus the table situation! The food was yummy and hot. The drinks and bottomless garlic fries were tasty. Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"This Red Robin used to be a frequent visiting place. Now it is a place to avoid at all costs. The only good food that is served is the fries. I received a chicken sandwich with a completely soggy bun and limp lettuce. I took the sandwich apart ate the bacon out out and nothing else. My water was empty my entire meal and never got refilled. Our waitress never came to check on us while eating so there was never a chance to complain. And when coming to tell us how to pay she didn't care to acknowledge the fact my food was barley touched so I did not care to leave a tip higher than a dollar. This has now occurred on three separate occasions we have waited for around 20 mins for drinks to be taken and had terrible service through out our meal as well as very very poor quality food. I don't understand why the restaurant was upgraded in the past only to lose a lot of business and not seem to care about customer service or the quality of food any longer. Unfortunately I can't say I have the desire to return to ANY Red Robin after the multiple bad experiences I have had at this one single location."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and left happy with an excellent burger.  Red Robin has never let me down."}
{"text":"My husband and grandkids came to eat dinner with us.  And the whole time it felt like the waiter continously tried rushing us off.  Not asking if we needed anything else.  Just brought over the bill.  It's continously fries.  I took my grandkids to restroom came back fries finally there no refill on drinks.  Very very disappointed"}
{"text":"Visited again, our waitress was eh.... ok.  However, she did ask about our tea if it was okay, if not she could bring us some more syrup to add more flavor.  Turns out, they make their tea and then add the flavoring/syrup per order.  She kindly brought us some syrup in a glass and we added our own, she also said it settles on the bottom so we stirred our tea up and much better.  For that, they get an A+!   We were seated quickly, waited on in a timely manner and our food was amazing, fresh and hot.   Still at the end, we had to wait a bit for the bill to be handled, but this time was a better experience."}
{"text":"For burgers that are $10-$15 I was expecting more. More beef, more quality toppings. A better burger would have been had at Smashburger or Five Guys for less money. Yes, at Red Robin you get unlimited steak fries but when we wanted more, our server was no where to be found.

We got the Royal (cheese burger with egg), and it was ok but nothing special. The egg was too underdone so it made a mess.  Also got the Prime Chophouse which comes with onions strings, horseradish grilled mushrooms, steak sauce (too sweet, tasted like bbq sauce) and provolone. Both ordered with a bit of pink, but the meat wasn't very flavorful and the patties not that thick. The Chophouse also is really rich and hard to finish.

First time to Red Robin, not impressed and probably won't be back. But if you want to try, sign up for their bday club and get a free burger for your birthday."}
{"text":"I had left a very nice 5 star review the last time we were here but I have to update my review to a 1 star because this was the worst experience my husband and I have EVER experienced. We were seated just fine and only had to wait five minutes before eating but after we sat down, we had to wait forever for our waitress to get our drink orders or to even come to our table! Once we got our drinks, she took our orders and we thought the night would be changed around since they were busy. 
Of course we were wrong. I had ordered sweet potato fries and got steak fries instead. If you haven't been to Red Robin before, they upcharge you $1.49 for those fries!!!!! My husbands burger was still pink even though he requested well done. We waited for our waitress to come back but she NEVER returned!!!!! Yes that's right folks, SHE NEVER CAME BACK! We got tired of waiting and decided to cash out. I can't believe we had to pay for the fries I never got! We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Took about 15 min to be seated... we were the only ones waiting and it wasn't busy at all. Once food was ordered it took about 30 min to get our food. Drinks came out quick but in two waves. The food was ok considering the egg on two Royal Robin Burgers were not cooked throughly. They also brought out the wrong fries (ordered garlic fries) and the fruit for two of the kids meal had \"to be cut\" so it did not arrive with the food (we waited 30 min for our food you would think the fruit would be the easiest thing to plate). While walking to the bathroom you can catch a glimpse of the kitchen... let me tell you... you can see an over flowing trash can, trash and food on the floor. The bathroom wasn't any better... it was dirty... trash on the floor and over flowing trash cans. You can see staff talking around the kitchen and sitting in the back booths drinking soda. Maybe they are coming off shift or taking a break? Who knows... it's about 0845 on a Thursday night... if it's just staff sitting around they can help tidy up a bit... Very disappointed. However our server was quick to fix things and the hostess was pretty nice. This isn't the first time we have been to this location and always given them the benefit of the doubt... even after getting a glass of Ice Tea with a lipstick stain on it (my husband doesn't wear lipstick)... So was it clean or did they give him someone's else's glass... not sure if we will come back to this location. Should have taken pictures."}
{"text":"Their food is good, but we were there for three hours the other day.  The waitress admitted that they were always under-staffed.  Their fries are popular, but I opted for the bottomless broccoli, which arrived well after everyone else had their fries, and apparently you need to specifically request more, although they might have been too generous with their endless lemonade, they actually gave me a second before I drank the first a couple of times.  She said they bring out more until you ask them to stop."}
{"text":"Red Robin is great. The burgers are juicy, the fries are delicious and the drinks are potent. The only problem I've ever had was when I took my vegetarian daughter to lunch here. On the menu, the veggie burger was specified as Morningstar Griller's Prime, and I even asked the waiter to be sure. When the burger arrived, it was a Gardenburger. I asked the waiter to take it back, and he gets someone else (I assume the manager), to come over and tell me that they have switched veggie burgers since the menu was printed. My daughter didn't want to take a chance on ordering anything else, so she just ate her fries."}
{"text":"Always go here for quick service and great food especially the fries.  Love their strawberry lemonade drimk always get one to go."}
{"text":"DONT GO HERE ! It will take FOREVER for you to be seated , the service is mediocre , the last 3 times ive been with my family they gave us fries that were almost raw we ask for new ones and this time there beyond greasy, to top it off our burgers were cold. Won't be going back for a long time."}
{"text":"Was in today for my birthday burger,place was full but got excellent customer service plus more.food was prepared very well as always.never had a bad experience and I've been there at all hours.of course I'll come back."}
{"text":"My son and I went to RR for lunch and always we had great food and fantastic customer service.no complaints,thank you"}
{"text":"There is a reason you drive 10 miles out of your way to eat at this RR:  the food is leagues better prepared and service so much better than Chandler mall.  Have never had a bad experience here.  Love the Ghost Pepper Burger and pretzel bites.  This location is still \"old school\" with the decor but I actually miss the kitchy days of old.  Come here!"}
{"text":"Located adjacent to the entrance of the mall. Generally good vibe. Always a din of sound due to the high traffic of people that frequent this establishment. 
Adequate seating for dining or for sitting at the bar. The TVs could be a little bigger. But the full bar makes up for that :-)
Always a good selection of unique burger combinations. Bottomless fries are a plus. But be sure to get the garlic fries. They are the best!
The servers were very professional and pleasant to work with.
Mid range prices for mid-range burgers. Overall very good."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery using the Yelp app and it was delivered fast and everything was still hot. I loved the onion rings and ensalada chicken platter and their ranch is so good! We've probably walked by Red Robin 100 times to go to Michoacán, but I plan to go to the restaurant sometime soon."}
{"text":"Dinner with my daughter. We don't get to do this as much as we used to. Remodel looks nice. Only thing...... I feel it lost the \"family\" feel it had before. Very nice, but more like a bar , not a family burger joint. 
Glenn our server was way above par. Excellent service, quick refills on drinks and fries. Food was great. Burgers cooked correctly. I had the \"über burger \". What a meal. It's very messy but awesome burger. The brat tops is nicely. The Ziosk was interesting. But I think you should not have to pay another $1.99 to play games. Like I told my daughter, let's chat with each other and leave the phones and games off. 
So in conclusion I get red robin 2 thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"My Fiance and I recently moved to Vegas. We woke up at 7am, loaded the Uhaul, drove 5 hours here, and unloaded the uhaul. We were exhausted and starving so we looked for something to eat. Craving the bottomless Rootbeer Floats and Fries we decided on Red Robin. Devon (with the Disney D!!) was our waitress, she was amazing. She was joking with us all night and was right on it with the refills. We have never left a 25% tip before but she really made a good impression for this new city. We will definitely be back to this location because of her. The food was amazing too. Thank you Devon!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this restaurant has such low ratings.  
The area was really clean.  
The wait staff was friendly,  and prompt.  
They Filled our drinks regularly.  

My food was hot and made as ordered.  
Delicious!!! 

We had a delightful time talking and eating.  
And I really felt like I got everything I needed.

It was a great visit, my first,  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Saturday evening. First tried the one off of 99th ave and McDowell but the wait was more than 30 mins so we drove a little further to this one and they stated the wait was 10 mins but we barely sat down and then they called our name. Our server Alexia was awesome from the very beginning until the very end of our visit. Alexia was friendly, prompt, remembered everything we asked for, made sure we all had everything we needed and more. She kept asking if we had any questions she would be happy to answer, would frequently check up on us it was great. I have been to the other Red Robin numerous times and have never had service as great as this one. The manager also was making the rounds to make sure everyone was taken care of. The food was good but everything seemed so much better due to the service that Alexia provided. Very happy customers!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are loyalty card members. Been here twice in the last couple of weeks. We love their burgers and fries as well as some of their other entrees. One time they forgot haystacks that go with the burger and when we inquired and received them they were cold. Usually I order only water but the last time I ordered one of the endless specialty drinks and I had to ask for it to be refilled instead of them offering like they did for my husband's soda. If it's to costly to be refilled maybe don't offer as endless? 
These are the 2 reasons for giving only 4 stars"}
{"text":"The last time been to Red Robin was back when lived in Colorado. Talking over twenty years ago. It was ok. Just another mass marketed chain burger restaurant. I came for lunch with visitors from the 808. This location its inside the Galleria Mall. It actually decent size for shopping mall location. 

I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger. It really comes down BBQ burger with fried onion rings and the basic works inside. I had no idea you could order half size or smaller size they call it. I ordered the regular size. My friend she ordered small size even then felt like that decent size. It came with your choice of sides stuck with tradition steak cut fries. The fries was not very good, under seasoned, not very hot and crispy out of the fryer. The burger thought was good. I definitely had better the same concept at other burger joints around town. We all shared the stack of onion rings. Again just ok. The presentation was kind of cool but once grabbed one nothing special about them. If anything tasted like frozen pre battered onion rings then fresh ones. Overall would say not the worst place in the world could go for burger but probably be my last last choice.

The service was ok. I thought was odd that the server was passing us the bill from behind our booth in service station. Rather then coming up to the table more professional. Never rude just felt like he not engaged and came to drinks not on top of keeping full glass."}
{"text":"It's a burger place.  They have lots of  burgers and their famous \"bottomless\" steak fries.   Just what America needs:  neverending french fries.  
I have to admit, however, I did enjoy it.  My bleu cheese burger (called the Blue Ribbon) was very good, the only downside being that the onion strings were not crispy.  Had they been crispy, it would have been excellent.  
What did I learn from the experience:  if you want to gain weight, work at Red Robin."}
{"text":"If you want a large variety of burgers, fabulous fries and great service then eat here. They have parmesan fries that are the best! If your looking for great filling food eat here."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times lately. They are a great service staff. We've come both times after a medical issue being starved by the time we get there, they rush order food for this crazy girl lol. It's clean, bathrooms clean, supportive staff good to each other. Ashley was amazing and will keep us coming back. The best fries ever garlic, potato, relay all excellent and never ending !! Burgers the best! I'll add photos soon."}
{"text":"Once again the Boca patty was hard and inedible.  One of the few places with a decent vegetarian option, but it's about 50/50 whether it's freezer burned or over-microwaved or something that turns it into a hockey puck.  Also, the soda tasted like dish soap."}
{"text":"Excellent service.. Mediocre burger.. I swear God answered my prayers with the Baja Ranch Dip! Ranch is my favorite food!"}
{"text":"visiting the zoo and decided to come to our favorite chain of restaurants. was a little disappointed because we had to send our food back 2 times because the bun was hard as a rock. the service was also not very good. it was very unorganized. over all it was not a great experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the new 'pay and skedaddle' option with the ziosk bill/tipper/credit card scanner. Super user friendly and so much better than waiting for a paper bill. Our server was extremely friendly, courteous, and attentive. Their mixed drinks are always great. Had the pina colada today and downed it..yummmm. I had the bacon cheeseburger but in a lettuce wrap and subbed broccoli for the fries. My burger was cooked perfectly, juicy and flavorful. Only complaint was the less-than-stellar bacon. Better off without bacon. Husband said the same about his pig out burger. Burger itself was perfect but not the bacon. The sweet potato fries he ordered tasted like they'd been double fried
In old oil. No good. My broccoli was much better. So hit and miss but had to give 5*s because the burger patties were just so darn good and service was amazing"}
{"text":"Worst service ever tonight, waitress, manager and bar manager all super rude. Will be the last time a
I come to this location."}
{"text":"Over priced burgers that are not that great we don't go there anymore there are much better burgers elsewhere."}
{"text":"I normally love Red Robin, but this location is going down hill.  It's messy and inefficient.  We arrived before the lunch crowd and had to wait an hour to be served.  And they served a drink with a glass that was broken.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited twenty minutes for a table, no manager, no sense of urgency. Amazing that this place is stain business."}
{"text":"We walked in to about 4 hostesses and a manager standing at the front and they greeted us. The manager was very friendly and nice to my one and a half year old son. Our server Rachel was excellent. Very accommodating when we asked for extras like fries out as an appetizer and extra ranch and campfire sauce. She offered refills on drinks and fries before we asked, she was very good at anticipating our needs. The manager visited our table a few times to deliver items and check in with us. The food is always delicious here. My husband tries different burgers but I am stuck on the whiskey river bbq burger! My son devoured his mac and cheese. This is definitely our go-to place for burgers!"}
{"text":"Yay for comfort food closer to home!  On my first visit, I was impressed with the host's poise under pressure, since this particular Red Robin had just opened a few days prior.  Customers were pouring in and despite the cramped quarters in the waiting area, host and servers were doing their utmost to remain positive and professional.  Our food was served hot, the bottomless steak fries were yummy as always (crisp on outside, steaming on inside, not greasy at all), and my husband's beer was gone too quickly.  Congratulations on the new location and we'll see you again soon, RR!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible manager and clueless cooks!! They screwed up my son's order and I had to send mine back since they undercooked my burger. Came back with it and I immediately found another mistake. The manager said she could fix it, but it wasn't major so I said, it was fine. Took a bite and realized they out tomato on my burger which I made abundantly clear I did not want. I pulled it out and took about 3 bites before I just couldn't eat it because the cooks put so much pepper on it, it was overwhelming. I sent back basically an entire burger and my son ate about 4 bites from his. The waitress came to our table twice and a third time because we reqested it. When she came to tell us to pay our bill we had to ask for one box and told her we didn't want the rest of the food. Might just be me, but that's a clear indication your customers were not satisfied. Not a care in the world from her or her manager. Won't ever be going back to this location again!! Paid 70 bucks for my husband to eat and my daughter to eat a kids meal. I'd go the distant to the San tan mall location where they know what they are doing and something called, customer service."}
{"text":"The food was fine, they just messed up my sisters burger which is fine but god they're so slow. She got her burger after the three of us were almost done with ours.. The bathroom was just nasty trash everywhere just slow slow service but nice staff"}
{"text":"I order the California grill chicken sandwich which came with guacamole bacon cheese on it along with fries and I ordered a side salad it was very delicious I will come back it was kind of expensive but I had the chocolate molding brownie with ice cream for dessert so the total checking to 17 dollars and 6 cents so I get 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel like the price kind of expensive"}
{"text":"Charlie, thank you for the great service and awesome salt caramel shake. I haven't been here in a very long time. Today I was very impressed with the quality of their food and drinks. We will be coming more often."}
{"text":"I went here a few months ago for the first time and the for the first time it was a very good expierence. The waitress came often she was very polite and well managed. We ordered an appetizer while ordering our food, but the appetizer came 3 minutes before the food so they gave us a free meal since the appetizer arrived right around when the food did. We ordered the tall tower of onion rings and have to say they were pretty darn good. They were very fresh and crispy. I ordered a burger and it was very tasty. the drinks were fresh and the place was well managed. I will definetly come back soon."}
{"text":"Great place! Great prices! We love the bottomless fries and beverages! Best part is they have a veggie patty that you can make as any burger!"}
{"text":"A-OK by me.  A typical Red Robin experience - slightly slow service and acceptable food.  Endless fries, which means the portion you get with your sandwich is small so make sure to ask for more.  The refill here was much smaller than what I usually get, but it was okay (I could've asked for more but I was tired).  Salad was ok enough, just wish the promotions were highlighted in the menu and not just the table tent - I hadn't noticed the special strawberry salad until after we ordered. :("}
{"text":"DISGUSTED! This location has taken a turn for the worst. First off, the tables were so sticky it felt like somebody washed them in syrup. 3 out of the 6 of us didnt have napkin,spoon or fork when they sat us down. When we got our strawberry lemonades, they tasted so sour and salty. Very disappointed because we love the strawberry lemonade here. So, he brings out the so called \"bottomless fries\". THE 2 BASKETS OF FRIES HAD 8 FRIES INSIDE OF THEM EACH. MAYBE 9 AT THE MOST. So after we quickly make the 16-18 french fries disappear, we ask our waiter for more fries and refills on our drinks. He then refills our lemonades (that taste even worse than the previous glasses) and brings out 2 more baskets of bottomless fries. This time the baskets have 7 fries each now. And thats the last time we see our waiter. We get our food from different servers. 10 minutes after we recieve our food, the waiter brings us the bill without even asking us if we were going to have dessert. Very poor  customer service. Staff was just out riight horrible. 

We werent even done with our food and he drops the bill on us. My brother ordered bottomless rootbeer floats and had to track down the waiter to get his refill. Now mind you, its 8pm on a Wednesday night. Its not even busy, and we were 6 of the 20 people who were in the place. Will never go back. As for the other 5 of the party, they also have let me know they will never go back. Sad."}
{"text":"Well I have been here many times in the past so I know what to expect even before walking through the door. There is the Welcome to Red Robin greeting, followed by the question as to how many are in your party? That is where the similarities end with this half burger chain and half sports bar and most chain restaurants. 

Yes there are other chain restaurants with locations scattered in and around the valley that all promise the same hand crafted burger masterpiece, but how many of them offer that delicious burger combined with bottomless fries? They may all offer similar products but ask anyone with any experience with chain style eateries and they will tell you there are always those small yet noticeable differences. 

This location is near to the mall which means it is usally populated by middle aged couples, 30 somethings who like a few cocktails with their meal ( watch out for them on the road) , and teens who want to hang with friends and share some really tasty burgers. Their claim to fame is their large selection of burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, and drinks. I normally order the mushroom swiss, or a bacon blue cheese burger. 

With each juicy bite I can feel my stomach growing and my waist line expanding LOL. Seriously if you want those little dried out frozen patties found at your local drive through then this is not the place for you. Honestly as with BBQ it is important to understand that if you are going to do something make sure you do it right!!! Don't take shortcuts, make sure you use the best ingredients you can afford, and most of all do not call something that it is not!! 

It is like saying you want a Philly Cheese steak sandwich and then cooking a package of steakums and placing it on two slices of white bread.  Seriously with about 13 of  what they call their signature burgers, 7 kinds of bread, 7 kinds of cheese, and a toppings list that would make old Mcdonald which they came from his farm this is the place to indulge all your grilled beef fantasies. Just make sure you learn from my experience and wear your large eating pants. Trust me you will need them.

Case closed"}
{"text":"Friendly service, delicious sandwiches and burgers, and bottomless garlic fries. Too bad their HH isn't great, but they do have one!

Service is fast and friendly. I usually share a burger with the bf, and they split it for us and that means extra fries! And their lemonades and cocktails are well made.

So many items on the menu, but I stick to a handful of them, but maybe one day I will be adventurous and try other things."}
{"text":"Got the donuts and they tasted like onion rings. They did take them off my bill and apologized, but it left an unsettling taste behind."}
{"text":"The food is usually decent but, the last time we went we didn't even get to order.  We waited 30 minutes for our waitress to come and take our drink order.  After 30 minutes my husband and I left because we gave her ample time to serve us and she did not follow through.  You shouldn't have to leave an establishment because the waitress is unwilling to do her job.

On a separate occasion, the first time we had her as a waitress she took my phone with her to look at a coupon.  Then, I saw her hand my phone to another customer!  I had to shout across the restaurant, \"That's my phone!!!\"  I honestly should have never let her take it from me in the first place, my mistake.  

Until this particular waitress finds another line of work, we will not be returning to the Monroeville location."}
{"text":"We've been to this particular location a few times. We always have good service and food. My husband always order the refillable root beer float (which comes in a huge mug, which really doesn't matter since it's refillable). This particular time my son and I ordered Very Berry Raspberry Limeade and Freckled Lemonade. Normally they come in little glasses that we end drinking right away. This time our waitress brought them in normal soda glasses right away. Which we loved. Not only did we not have to keep bugging her for refills but she didn't have to keep running and getting them. The only downside this time (hence the loss of 1 star) was my son and husband both added on chili cheese fries to their meals (instead of the regular fries) for an extra charge. We just assumed that they would be bottomless just like the regular fries. However, when we got our refill on fries they were just normal fries. The price they paid was definitely not worth the little bit of chili they got on their first set of fries. Next time we'll just get regular fries."}
{"text":"Red Robin is a chain of restaurants-- so as far as the food goes, I think this location did its job there. I have no issues with the food or the timing of our order. Everyone's food came out together and tasted just like how I remember it from previous visits. So, I'm a happy camper. 

However, I do have to mention that this restaurant is all over the place with it's customer service. Maybe I just came on a weird night, who knows? We walked in and I go to put our name in for a table. The two hostesses at the podium just ignored me. After a good minute or so, they finally look up and ask me what I wanted with a look of annoyance. Should of probably left, but we were all hungry so I decided to just move past it. I gave them my name and we waited for about 20 minutes for a table. Once seated, our server came. She danced her way to the table, told jokes, and was very outgoing. Which wouldn't be a bad thing at all, but she was really loud and made jokes about things that I was a little apprehensive about considering that we just met her. 

Sometimes, you just want to have a nice relaxing meal and this location was definitely not the place for it. Between the grumpy hostesses and the overly friendly server, it was like a circus of emotions up in here. The things you do for unlimited steak fries.

Thankfully there's more than one Red Robin in this area, so I'll be skipping this location and going to the other one down the street where I can eat my mozzarella sticks in peace."}
{"text":"For the second time we've come here the services from the wait staff has been fair at best!! Both times we brought our kids on there Birthday and they didn't get acknowledged!  Sad!"}
{"text":"The food is typically good here. The staff is hit-or-miss. We were seated quickly on our latest visit. Bonus points!

Our waitress had an attitude whenever we got her attention, as if we were a major bother to her. Not that we were able to get her attention often, as she was nowhere to be seen for most of our visit.

When our food was served, we had to ask for silverware. We had to ask for water refills and be patient about getting them. It took ages to get anyone's attention to ask for more of the bottomless fries, and it took about 20 minutes after asking for them to bring us a measly amount. We would've like to have had more, but decided against asking as we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for them. At least the food we *did* get was good.

The new little ordering tablets they have on the tables would be awesome if they were there to supplement the service (as I imagine they're intended to do), but it appears some of the staff view them as a replacement for face-to-face service.

We come here for the food. We don't expect to be waited on hand and foot. But when the server has such an attitude and scarcely appears after being seated, it doesn't make us keen on coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place when I am looking for something more than just a fast food burger. My personal favorite is the Blue Ribbon Burger its so tasty. It has just the right amount of bleu cheese an steak sauce topped off with crispy onion strings and don't forget to try the parmesan garlic fries with your burger."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. They have tv's to watch the games throughout the restaurant - which is nice."}
{"text":"Went there for my mother in laws birthday. What a mistake. Drink orders were all mixed up. Took forever for the food to come out and this was  Tuesday at 5:30, not busy at all. Drink refills after 45min. Food was just ok. Tried to pay the bill and it was a 30 minute ordeal. Out waitress was nice but in the wrong line of work. The manager just walked around doing nothing. She should have stepped in and sorted this out and then apologized for the mix up."}
{"text":"Cold fries, overpriced burgers.  Not really for me.  Nice try though Red Robin.  I'd pay a premium price if your burgers were good, but seriously, not even half as good as 5 Guys.  More like McDonald's or Applebees.  Marginal at best."}
{"text":"Been here many times over the years, and maybe it was because it was after a busy State basketball tourney, but our recent experience was a little erking. I'm not sure how soon I'd see myself going to this location again.
Messy floors was the start. Ok, it's 8pm on a Saturday night. Our server was our favorite part and he was really helpful when both of our meals came out, not only cold, but still raw...like, burger had just been put on for a minute to brown on the inside. They were kind enough to make a better burger for us both as we jokingly said they could nearly burn it if need be. We also did not care to have comped bills but it had been done regardless.
The thing that tipped me was the cleanliness. The kitchen had been the spot to drop food or bags and leave them to walk over. The guy with a binder also did not look as if to care. And the bathroom was....well, there was a teddy bear in a toilet that was pooped on........in the girls bathroom. Not entirely sure how long it had been there, or why no one before us said something. The crowd must have trashed their restroom in the midst of the chaos before us!
In the long run, my friend ended up being sick that evening. Just a bad day to be there I suppose."}
{"text":"August 3, 2013, This night was not a good red robin night. I guess it was a blue night. We have dined here before therefore, we knew what to expect at this restaurant. I ordered the clam chowder soup as an appetizer. This took forever to come and when it finally came, it was about 3 minutes before the food came. Then the soup was running like a river. I was upset about that and then it was a river soup. The orders were all messed up. We ordered black beans and they bought out fries. My son ordered grilled chicken and oranges and they bought him grill cheese and fries. I guess the waitress was ordering our food for us tonight. Once that was corrected and the manager came over you would think things would have gotten better... auuuh NOT!! They forgot the black beans and when it finally came out.. it was cold. Now what in the world. Really... how are black beans cold. That makes no sense at all. That basically told us the pot was not on at all. Then the manager visited our table again. Soo when it was all said and done the manager treated us to nice deserts. Since the meals were all jacked up from the beginning to the end. We had the mud pie which was good ice cream for days and I had the brownie which was delicious. We may return but not sure if it will be this year. They were just completely off tonight. We have visited this location several times. We were very disappointed in the service tonight. Maybe time will change something's... next year."}
{"text":"Two words:  Speckled Lemonade!  Whoever made this creation is godsend.  After we order our drinks, we come to their crazy assortment of burgers, salads, wraps, and entrees.  I love how you can substitute vegetarian patties instead of their meat filled menu(at NO EXTRA CHARGE!).  I also enjoy their bottomless fries and the honey mustard dressing.  The dressing is a nice mixture of sweet and tangy.  Even after all that, then comes dessert.  The sundaes are very good.  Every time we go there, we enjoy our meal and come out satiated."}
{"text":"It has been quite awhile since we have been here. The last time, was not too good.
However, this time we had a great server. Her name was Angela and she made all the difference.
I notice that the prices have gone up. The Burgers looks a little smaller as well. But, Angela made it a great meal regardless. 
We got Sangria and she even brought us water with lemon and straws. Anticipating our needs before we even asked.  Burgers were good ,cooked as we liked them. With everything we wanted. THe sweet potato Fries were cold when we got them. So our server got us another plate right away.
She checked on us several times and was very quick with the refills. One of the s=best servers we have had anywhere for a long time actually. 
One this I noticed is the TV that used to be in the floor in the waiting area is gone. Just something I thought I would add. Because, I always thought that was an unusual thing to have there. But, a bit unique ."}
{"text":"I have been to RR many times but on my recent trip to this location, i possibly had the best experience of all.  The service was quick and the food was excellent.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Burger was good. Service was good.  Would have given them 4 stars but don't have tabasco sauce!  Smh."}
{"text":"When I think of burgers, Red Robin doesn't even come to mind.  I came here years ago and never returned.  They give a free burger for birthdays which is the only reason I gave them another chance after all these years but sadly the food hasn't improved since my last visit but apparently they're doing something right with 2 locations on Harris Blvd....just not sure what it is."}
{"text":"Not a good day at RR cold fries slow slow service. They gave my wife the wrong dressing. The manager came by and fixed but really an off day very disappointed"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a group of people after spending the morning at Mt. Charleston.  We weren't seated right away, since we did come alt the peak of their lunch, but the manager and hostess adequately informed us of the status and we were seated in a reasonable amout of time.

I don't really remember many servers names but the one we had today, Walter was amazing!! He was slammed and we could tell,  but no matter how busy he was and how much running around he had to do (and he was running all over alot) he wasn't rude, he didn't forgot anything, he checked on us plenty and best part he was extremely friendly. 

The food was your typical buger and salad place. We did try the tower of onion rings and doh-nuts...yumm!!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't like dining here because of the very lousy service and expensive burgers, but the wife and family like it.  Don't know why.  Had a going away dinner last night for my nephew and we ordered only two sodas but it showed up on three checks because we paid dutch.  Couldn't understand why because 7 of us had water.  I never got a refill nor did I even get a visit from our waitress-terrible service.   Never again will I go back.  $14+ for a lousy burger!!  come on...the price should have been around $5-6 bucks."}
{"text":"Went to Red Robin today! It was the worst experience ever eating there! It was busy I might say but it took so long to get our food I was thinking we may have to leave! People who came after us got their food! Finally when it came it was not what I ordered! When waiter came he said that's what I ordered, I said no, my husband ordered for me and I heard him say Royal Red Robin burger! The waiter seemed annoyed, never apologized but said he would put in replacement order! Okay I'm waiting even longer now!!! When it came, I tried to cut it in half to pick it up and the bun fell apart everywhere! He never asked me how I wanted the egg cooked, it was sunny side up and the white was not done! It spilled out and made the bottom bun soggy, never have I eaten a hamburger with knife and fork but I was forced too! The burger had no seasoning and a half slice o bacon was on one side! Then the tomato was mush! All in all it was bad! Now I have eaten this burger for many years in lots of places and other states even, it was my favourite, but I probably will never go back to this Red Robin again! We had another waitress refill our drink because our waiter never came back! We paid by the device on the table and left unhappy customers!!!!"}
{"text":"Had Lunch Wednesday this week. I had the new burger on the Tavern menu- it was a spicy burger menu said had hot pepper cheese and a new sauce spicy but I didn't find it to be spicy but it was tasty. I liked onion rings you can get as side for a little extra. My friend had a bbq chicken wrap she liked it.so it was a good meal for both. i went last Thursday for my freebie ham burger- i had large reds tavern
Burger cooked too
Perfection. It was really good oneI small
Problem bottomless fries are not!I want another helping and waitress never brought them to
Me? If their bottomless them when your finished the should ask you if you
Like more ? My one thing also bottomless was an orange cream soda The menu said this delicious drink -they put ice on top whip cream which made it hard to stir in- what they should do mix it at bar with ice drain then whip cream so you can mix it in better  yourself! I didn't get a bottomless cream orange soda either? My lunch friend got her 2 raspberry cream one but I got 0-? Maybe we disabled are invisible to Red Robin staff? Its hard to eat out in wheelchair but the menu said bottomless drinks and fries and you should get them! other places like Sesame inn and  Bone fish treat disabled people nice and respectful- Red Robin Your staff needs to take courses on what the menus says& we should be asked would you care for another order of bottomless fries too!   





6-3-2017 I want to thank all the staff at Red Robin at A Hills Village Mall.! I went There to have a take out of Big ted Tavern burger sweet potato Fries& side Onion rings to Go- time2o min to wait on sat wasn't bad either! Well I forgot to give my reward card which After paying meal they took and noticed my. Birthday reward free burger- And since I already paid meal they gave me refund $7.00! What a nice thing to do and the staff said Happy birthday too!thats RR you made my early BDay sweet and my dinner was fantastic as I watched PGAGolf on TV"}
{"text":"One of the few chains that I frequent.  They serve a good burger and the service is typically good. Sometimes all we ask for is consistency and RR typically delivers.  Only had one incident here with a bad server and when I complained to corporate they sent me a gift card. Problem diverted and they kept a loyal customer. Will be back... Like every month!"}
{"text":"Clearly a terribly managed store. Lots of disgruntled employees texting on their cellphones. I would be pissed if I were the franchisee. 

Almost cold fries served with the burger which was *barely* cooked. Perhaps the cook was too preoccupied with his cellphone? I should have taken a picture.

If this were my business, I would make it clear to my employees that cellphones should remain in your locker, and if you are caught texting while working you will get a warning and will be subsequently fired for the 2nd offense.

Very mediocre burger, crappy side salad. Expensive beer ($6) for domestic.

So much potential, ruined by bad management. I've been to *much* better Red Robins in the Midwest where they have a much stronger work ethic and take more pride in their product, apparently."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the first time eating at this location my fiancé ended up getting food poisoning service was ok but the fries were good!"}
{"text":"The service was very good and quick. Ordered a Octoberfest burger and guest a cheeseburger. 
The amount of Fries served was more than enough where asking for endless ones was not needed. Can't say either of us was impressed with the burgers. Both of us thought it was similar to meatloaf or had a filler (though that's doubtful). Don't mind spending $10 for a burger, but IMO this one was not worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is good and the service is good, but it's a bit expensive.  ($13 burgers and $8 beers).   The kiosks at every table make paying and reordering very convenient.   Would appreciate more healthy menu options."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to come here for her birthday dinner.  Out of all the times I've gone to Red Robin I have never experienced such terrible service.  Our server doesn't speak, she's not around for refills.  My girlfriend ask for more information about a drink and did not want to yell across the table, so she asked the server to come to her side of the table and the server walk away and started serving another table.  WILLL NOT BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Plain and simple a good burger.  Huge amounts of burger types which is nice.  Fries are hit and miss in respect to whether they are old or new, warm or cold, cooked properly or not realy proper.  

Always a freindly staff"}
{"text":"RED ROBIN.... YUM!

shoot they aren't kidding with that commercial are they!

Came here for the 1st time with family. There were about 6 of us. It was lunch time on a monday. Wasn't too busy but there were about 5 waitresses working. 

Can I tell you that 4 of them were gathered in a circle by where the food comes out just chit chatting. I was getting pissed standing there by the hostess' stand while the girls were chatting about their weekend. I literally had to speak up and say \"excuse me!\" Normally im not so straight forward, but hey, i was 5 months pregnant, starving and obviously my hormones were raging. Not the person to mess with FYI. Minus one star.

We were sat immediately after my comment and I turned to my husband and said if we get one of those girls I'm going to scream..

Luckily for all the other patrons in the restaurant we were given another waitress.. one you could tell was working her ass off. WTG! Now i was a happy camper! She quickly got us our drinks and asked if it was our first time or  if we had any questions.

Looking at the menu I quickly knew I was going to have a hard time choosing. I was stuck between the mouthwatering chicken sandwich. Another with bacon and onion straws or my favorites caesar salad & tortilla soup. What made it even harder was that the 1st two choices came with unlimited fries. You heard me... UNLIMITED FRIES! Thats a pregnant womans dream.

Knowing that my hubby was getting a burger I opted for the salad and soup and figured i'd be a \"naughty\" girl and steal some of his fries. I mean, shoot they're unlimited so why not.

While waiting for our food, I turned and OMG those 4 people were still just standing there talking.. I was about to ask for the manager when i noticed a manager walking over to them and scolding. Dang! about time. They only cost the company an hours worth of pay!

The food was delish. Fries were always warm and seasoned to perfection. My salad had freshly cut lettuce and enough crutons for my hearts desires. My tortilla soup was perfect. I asked for extra cheese and sour cream. hey, im pregnant, im allowed those extra carbs! And it made it so rich and thick. Mmm, mmm. 

Our waitress continued to give us fantastic service. our drinks were always full. Fries always on the way. Ranch for our fries too. My party and I left happy and full. 

Def coming back here. But I better not get one of those girls!"}
{"text":"No more unlimited steak fries unless you ask. 

We had a large reservation for a Saturday evening. When we arrived, we were extremely disappointed to find that the manager couldn't seat us not only together, but on opposite sides of the restaurant to the point where we couldn't even see each other. He acted like we were inconveniencing him. 

Having worked in the industry for years, I offered some suggestions of how we could make this work & he simply refused to listen. Well, now you can listen to my feet walk out the door ... Our parties were on opposite sides, our side was literally done eating before the other side even got their food. RIDICULOUS. Checks got messed up and mixed up. There were things on our tabs that NO ONE had ordered. 

No mas, Red Robin."}
{"text":"We don't come here often, but when we do, it doesn't disappoint. The service is okay. It seems a little hands off, but at least it's friendly. The place is straightforward. The burgers aren't super elaborate, but their options are good. Bottomless fries are simple but seasoned well. Easy check out with the tablet system."}
{"text":"DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE. 

First walking in the hostess lacked the knowledge to count four people to seat us. We were seated in the bar even though we weren't drinking and so it began. We ordered our drinks and went to wash our hands. My mom slipped on chips on the floor but thankfully caught herself but still strained her adductor muscles catching herself. The blonde bartender seemed I phased and shrugged. Are you KIDDING me? Stupid does not destined the staff - maybe incompetent or just plain morons. 

We then ordered our food and the chips were still there. We ordered three salads and one wrap. All the dressing was given on the side even though we didn't ask for it to be on the side. The salads were poorly made and food lacked any real flavor. I feel like I could have gotten more flavorful food out of a dumpster. 
The \"manager\" came by and took my moms information, but didn't even comp her salad for her inconvenience. But I'll be contacting corporate so her dumb a** need not do any real work.

Overall DONT come here. Waste of time and money. Unless you like bland food and moronic staff then this is your place!!"}
{"text":"I bused it to Red Robin today for one reason and one reason only: boredom.

When I get bored, my stomach growls.

So here I am, writing this after a mediocre dinner made enjoyable only by our waiter and cheesestick platter.

My dining partner, a rambunctious young man with an annoying tendency towards CHEESESTICK GLUTTONY, sat with me at about 6 PM at one of the outside tables. It took us about 10 minutes to get anyone to serve us even though we were ready with menus set aside. That part was kind of frustrating.

Once our lovely waiter made his existence known, we ordered our drinks, appetizers and entrees. Poppin' Purple Lemonade and Raspberry Lemonade were brought out shortly. Both tasted delicious, despite the fact that my DINING PARTNER kept stealing guzzles (not sips, guzzles) of my drink.

Next, the cheesesticks were brought out. This dish, and this dish alone, was the only cuisine we sampled that managed to have a positive impact on this review. I love the cheesesticks. Seriously, just get the cheesesticks.

The Garden Burger with steak fries was brought out next. Mediocrity to the core. Honestly, the burger tasted like something I would get in a crummy rehab cafeteria. Or school cafeteria. Or vegan jail cafeteria. I'm not a vegan, by the way... I just happen to enjoy veggie burgers. But this one was just drab. I will forever label it the Cafeteria Burger instead.

Our waiter was a nice dude, and once he got our order started, he made sure that we were served promptly. Because of him and the cheesesticks, I will make the bus travel again someday to try more of the menu and maybe change my opinion. Until then, I shall remember Red Robin as an all-American adventure in burgers that I feel \"whatever\" about and dining companions who should have stayed at home.

(No stars taken off for said companion. But he was just so awful today.)

Enjoy, fellow eaters!"}
{"text":"So far it's ok, was seated fast, initial service was fast: then came our drink order and bam there is the first snag - 15 minutes to get drinks. Let's see how this goes. I'll keep you updated! Update: food was ok as a typical \"big box brand\" the service sucked! Ok needed a little help, he was nice but just was overwhelmed with all tables he had. I would go back provided I drank a beer first!"}
{"text":"Why do we keep coming back to this place? There was a running gag on Cheers. Norm would come in complaining about his recent visit to the Hungry Heifer.  No matter how bad the food was, Norm always went back and he never knew why exactly. I feel that way about this place, except I know why I keep returning: because my youngling likes the place.  If we didn't have a kid, or had one with better taste, I'd probably never return.  Look, it's not that the burgers are bad, it's that they're so mediocre. They are memorable for being so unmemorable. The one burger that I did kind of half-way enjoy (something with slaw and hot sauce I think) was discontinued. Chicken sandwiches are in the same class of unmemorable foods. So I stick with salads, which as salads go are pretty dull, and French onion soup. About that soup: I'm under no illusion as to what I'm getting at Red Robin as far as French onion soup goes. I've had some excellent onion soups (try Zinc Bistro or Sophie's sometime). I've made exceptional onion soups myself. Here, all I expect is that it kind of taste like an onion soup and that the onions are at least cooked down enough to be tender. This place used to be able to deliver, but recently the onions have been rather firm and the pieces of onion in the soup on the large side. The soup guy isn't slicing his onions fine enough and he's not cooking them long enough. I found the same thing happening at the Red Robin over on Cooper and US60. You know what I decided? SAME SOUP GUY!  He's just traveling around making lousy soup. At the other store he's actually going to the trouble of burning some of the onions beyond recognition so that you get mostly undercooked onions with a few pieces of carbon floating around for good measure. Just get rid of this guy, cook the onions properly, and we're back in business, Red Robin. Just you and me and your reasonably tolerable onion soup."}
{"text":"As a frequent guest of Red Robin, I enjoy the familiar atmosphere, good food and drinks.
This location however is not like other Red Robins. If you've been to other Red Robins, the food and beverages will be very familiar.  The decor and size of this Red Robin is squuezed.  What you'll also notice is that you have to ask for things.  Having to ask for refills is common.  The drinks do not flow here.  I also notice every time we visit that the place is messy. It takes a awhile to clear and clean tables. I did not see anyone interested in sweeping the floor which was a growing hazard. This last visit we  brought our family, we observed five tables sit over 15 minutes from the time people left to the time it was cleared. What got me counting was how long our visit took.  We were seated within 5 minutes which is great for a group of six people. From there it took ten minutes for a drink order. This appeared common for other tables and is common on most of our visits. We ordered meals with our drink order from there everything was suprisinlgy quick. Our meals came quickly and as we normally expect, they were delicous. Then the pace came to a crawl. We had to ask for refills. Here we watched a number of wait staff begin to flow out the door. This was between 7:30 and 8pm. We waited patiently to order desert for 15 min. We had told our waiter that people were looking forward to desert at the beginning of our meal. When we flagged a waiter it took 15 min for our waiter to arrive and he had our check in hand. We asked for desert and our waiter was pleasant but overwhelmed. The resturant was only half full at this time. Overwhelmed staff is normal at this localtion. While we are waiting we notice more staff leaving, no tables cleared and the floor is a hazard.  Desert comes we all finish up and a normal meal that takes less than an hour at other Red Robins is almost 2 hours here. This is not uncommon for this location. We pay our bill and they somehow lose our cards. Gift cards and whatever bonus card thing is gone. I got my credit card back luckily but was so dissapointed.... again. I still tipped at my normal 20% but was very tempted not to tip at all. I'm not sure if this problem was our waiters fault or an overall issue. Why should I punish my waiter when it appeared the whole store had iasues. We spoke to the manager about our experience and let me note we were given a gift card for half the price of our meal. This was a nice gesture but it's a repeating problem. There is Five Guys behind this restaurant that is about the same price with a better burger but I like atmosphere. As we walked out, we walked out with three more staff. As we turned back the same five tables that had not been  cleared were only just being cleared but we could now see it was a worse issue throughout the restaurant and not just our section. Could all those staff who were leaving cleanup before they left? With all the choices around it will be sometime before we return to Red Robin here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It was very disappointing. Although the server was nice, everything felt rushed.  My burger was over-salted and luke warm. It did not taste fresh and hot. All I had was fries and lemonade.  When I reported that I did not like my meal I was not offered to have anything else and the bill was brought over immediately afterwards.  I will not be back for awhile. This is disappointing to someone who enjoys the variety of burgers the restaurant has to offer."}
{"text":"Went here again today. Just a side note to what I previously mentioned. This is NOT the place to come and watch a game. Now that baseball season is back (FINALLY) I decided to eat lunch here and sit in the cocktail area to catch a bit of a game. Their televisions are tiny and from where I could see were neither flat screens or HD. Boo. 

Service was bad again. The server was really cute but seemed not to give a crap. It looked like he was getting his bar cleaned and shut down so he could go home but there were three tables in the cocktail area, all needing to either be greeted or helped, and he ignored us. Oh and my salad came out with avocado slices, even though the picture on the table showed that it was supposed to come with them. So the servers don't really have a clue what they are doing and neither do the cooks, obviously. This is my strike two at this location. They have one more chance and that's only because their burgers are so darn good."}
{"text":"So great burger, great turkey burgers too... Frys pretty bomb. .75 for chipotle mayo tho?? Come on now red robin!! Oh and our waiter Adam was the TRUTH. Great attitude. Kinda cute too!!!"}
{"text":"I really like their burgers and garlic fries (yuummmm!!).  Yesterday they were donating their tips to the families of the Colorado shootings too. Like them even more!"}
{"text":"Confession time. I don't really dig burgers that much. I mean, they are okay, but I rarely crave them. 

I also hate eating at chains. Especially noisy ones that welcome children and the servers wear \"flair\" and have group sing-a-longs for birthdays.

So why have I eaten at this Red Robin countless times? Well, a friend of mine as he puts it \"do love him some fries,\" and Red Robin gives endless fries until you can eat no more. We've had many a carb coma to attest to this fact.

But aside from the potato gluttony, the food is actually pretty good. Far better than I expect most chains to be. The menu is extensive and you can customize any burger the way you like it. My friend always gets the cheeseburger with a substituted Boca burger and I usually have a turkey burger variation of some other listed burger. The staff is always friendly without being obnoxious and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Always love coming here with the wife. 

We always get an onion ring tower that we both share, craft beers, and then tavern doubles that never disappoint.

Drew, our usual waiter, is always happy and very knowledgeable about the food and beers when we want to try something new. 

Overall great dining experience, which keeps us coming back for more."}
{"text":"We love their burgers here and I personally love their garlic fries. I would've given them all 5 stars but lately every time we come here their garlic fries keep coming out different. Its quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Red robin is one of our family's favorite places to go. My son absolutely loves it, plus it was great to find one since we always went it Cali. Moving to Las Vegas has been hard and this feels like home the staff is always wonderful."}
{"text":"Met my friend for lunch and ... It's ok. However, we did get the appetizer of spinach artichoke dip and it was really yummy!  The service was really good and my sandwich was ok. I love that they have bottomless fries. That's always a plus. My 3 stars comes from the price. I think it's ok but I can think of better burger places for the same price or cheaper. I think $9+ for a (frozen) burger is a bit steep."}
{"text":"Sometimes life is a compromise. Like when my lunch buddies at work want to drag me to Applebee's or Chili's or some junk like that for lunch, I'll compromise with Red Robin. We're still talking junky food from all the same venders but at least they have bottomless steak fries and other perks.  

The biggest advantage of eating here is that I can get a Royal Red Robin Burger. Basically this means a regular hamburger with an egg laid on top of it. How awesome is that? If you know anything about me, you know that I love fried eggs on top of anything; pancakes, beef, asian rice bowls, anything!  Okay so yeah, the egg, it's awesome. Let's talk about what's not awesome. Lettuce. Order this thing without lettuce and you will thank me in the morning. I mean something so beautiful is an egg on a hamburger doesn't need to be ruined by warm vegetation! The description says crisp lettuce? That is lies and we both know it. Just say no to lettuce.  

Some other ideas for this sandwich are: Sprinkle some of that Red Robin seasoning on it. It's pretty good. Order it with a chocolate milkshake. That can't be bad.  Oh and Red Robin's has a pretty sweet deal where their French fries are all you can eat, or as I like to call it, the kids eat for free special. So if you have like 20 effin' kids, please take them here and feed them all these French fries, meanwhile you get to mow down on this tasty sammich. I have the best ideas!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I adore Red Robin and visit about once a month. I'm well-familiar with the food and service typical of Red Robin.

My mother and I went on Sunday, after church. Our server was Bruce, who was very friendly, but extremely harried and forgetful; a lunch that should have taken less than an hour took us two whole hours!! That's Olive Garden slowness, not typical Red Robin speed.
Our orders were simple: two burgers. Mine was fine, but mom ordered a chicken Whisky River BBQ and it was so salty that she had them remake it. That wasn't a huge issue, though.

If you ever eat here, only eat with Bruce if you're not in a hurry - he was slow when refilling our drinks, we had to ask for boxes three times because he kept walking away and doing other sidework for his empty tables. I overheard how he forgot things for one of his other tables next to us. And while he was pleasant, he would essentially come by, set your food down, and rush off to do whatever else he was thinking about.

Not a good Red Robin experience at all; probably my worst. Unfortunately will be back, because the mall location is even worse in service, but hopefully there are some other servers at this location who are better."}
{"text":"Wait was atrocious with lots of open seating. Must have kitchen staffing issues. Should have just gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"Free food is always a plus. You get your Birthday burger the month of your birthday, not on the actually day. That is another plus. And, you get a choice of the hamburger or chicken sandwich. They are very accommodating. Food was good, Service was very good. Our waitress was friendly and kind. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We had an absolute wonderful experience. Taylor was so sweet and our server Omar was so amazing! Best server we have had including some up scale restaurants. He took the time to listen to my gluten allergy and helped me make proper choices! They have a dedicated fryer for the gluten free fries only! As well as a fryer dedicated to seafood only. This helps eliminate cross contamination which is super important for me. They have gluten free buns too. I opted for the gluten free bun with the guacamole bacon burger and gluten free fries! Perfect! My husband ordered fish and chips. My 5 year old had mac and cheese and 6 year old son had grilled chicken. We all enjoyed the service and the food! The manager ( I forgot to get his name) was amazing! We will be coming back to this location! 

Side note: If you come here with kids not only can you play games on the little screen on the table but you can also have them grab a small chalk board and chalk located towards the restrooms."}
{"text":"Red Robin has been a favorite for years in my family. Their burgers are outstanding with excellent variety. 

Bottomless steak fries are always welcome. Excellent menu choices at great portion sizes. 

Tip: it is almost always busy so be prepared for 30-45 min waits for dinner if you have more than 4-5 in a party. 

Because of the busyness of the place some servers can be pulled in lots of directions so attentiveness can vary."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars because I love Red Robin and usually we get better service then today. 

Not sure what was wrong today and the waiter was rude and we asked for fries & napkins and never received them. We asked again and finally she brought some. Also under the table there was a bunch of silverware that was on the floor, they haven't cleaned up I guess. Also she never took the menus from our table which was bugging us cause there was like 7 menus! Also when we got our food the fries were cold & we waited a long time for the food, we were disappointed. We asked for more fries but by then our burgers were getting cold. 

I hate how they give you a couple of fries but not enough to finish your burger with your fries. Next time order fries before your food comes or when they bring your food so your fries will be ready. 

They do have unlimited fries(free) but you have to ask for them. Also the seasoning is delicious on them. 

The freckled lemonade is good. I love there mozzarella sticks. Their onion rings are okay. The tavern burger is good and only $6.99. I had the bacon burger this time and it was good. They also changed their menu. Also they have tvs inside. 

On your birthday they give you free ice cream. 

Also sign up for rewards to get a free burger during your birthday month. Also sometimes they have deals for reward members."}
{"text":"I went to Red Robin for lunch today and was disappointed in the experience. I sat at a table in the bar area and the service was terrible. It took 10 minutes for the waiter to show up and take my drink order. I ordered a beer which didn't arrive for another 6 minutes. I had to give the waiter the evil eye as he was walking past the bar and that got him to order the drink from the bartender, so I don't know when he was planning on getting it if I hadn't done anything. During this time frame a woman had sat at the table next to me and already left from lack of service. Nobody even bothered to at least bring her a menu. I was starting to wish I had just left the place as well.

I ordered the blue ribbon burger with garlic fries which took 14 minutes to arrive. I slowly sipped my drink during this time because I didn't want to wait forever for another one. For the amount of stuff that comes on the burger, it was surprisingly kind of bland. The garlic fries were good but they gave a very small portion and I ate through them very quickly. By the time I was almost done with my burger I finally got my fries refilled. This time they were horrible and inedible. It tasted like they just dumped the seasoning all over them. I finished my burger, paid and got out of there feeling very unsatisfied. I have no plans on going back there again."}
{"text":"We had to ask for one persons drink multiple times, seems like they do not give you as many Fries as they use too. Red robin was a lot better when it was a basket for your burger and Fries. Seems like they are trying to be high glass with fancy plates and small cylinders for fries. Food good like always service and atmosphere leave something to be desired"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and the service is hit or miss.  We have had absolutely horrible service and then good service.  Today was good service.  Van was our server.  She was bubbly and on top of things.  My parents got the bottomless rootbeer float.  We have ordered these in the past and notice that for whatever reason they never seem to have enough ice cream. The food is always ok at Red Robin.  Based on today's visit RR would get a 4 but based on all visits together it is about 2.5 and that is largely based on the less than stellar service that we usually get from here.  The food however, has always been good."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian so of course this isn't going to be my favorite place. bUT- they do have a Veggie patty that is not terrible (not great). Plus the fries are fantastic! So due to the steak fries i will come here once in awhile. 

They do have a full bar too."}
{"text":"Red Robin stepped it up and I gave them another chance. Glad I did, service was much improved, even on a busy night, and we enjoyed some good food. Thank you Red Robin for stepping up to the plate!"}
{"text":"Normally 4 stars, but not today. One of my pet peeves is asking me how I want my burger cooked and then cooking it however you want.  If you don't know how to make a burger to order,  then don't ask. I ask for well done and get medium. Service from Lindsay was great."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Red Robin and 
This is the best Red Robin I've been to. 
Great food!!
Great service!!
Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Food was OK, service was OK.  Checked my bank balance today and $2.15 more than I signed for was withdrawn from my account.  Stealing from your customers is not OK.  Will NEVER be back to this Red Robin."}
{"text":"Well. This is the last time I will be coming to this Red Robin. We were seated promptly but it took forever to get the server to even get us a drink order. Finally they took our order and the next long wait came for our food. Now, this it the reason I will not come back. The food came out on dirty plates like they have never been washed. The manager was the one who brought the food out and when it was brought to her attention she blew it off. Obviously with this lack of concern I would hate to see what the back looks like. The food, well it used to be halfway decent. Save your money and go down to burger king or McDonalds.  You will save money and time!"}
{"text":"Being out of town on a business trip, my two co-workers and I were looking for something fast, convenient, and familiar so we thought we would pop in here.  I had never been to a Red Robin before and trusted their judgment.  I wish I had never  entered this place.

Our server, Denisse (yes, that is how it is spelled on my receipt), kept talking in the third person with are we ready, have we decided, are we enjoying the meal which started off as annoying but we figured out later was to disguise bad service.  I ordered a large draft beer yet she brought a small.  \"Sorry about that\" vs. getting what I ordered was the response.

It got worse from there - I hate \"special\" sauce on burgers and ordered a cheeseburger dry but mustard on it.  I was very specific about it when ordering yet  I received a cheeseburger liberally lathered in the special sauce when everyone else's food came out.  It took a while to get Denisse's attention to tell her the order was wrong, and I received another \"sorry about that\" with no recourse.  After I asked her to take it back she reluctantly asked if she could get me another.  Not wanting her or the cook to spit on my food since I had already complained about the wrong orders (beer, main course) I just asked for her to credit the account and not cook me another as my co-workers would be finished with their meals when it came back.

That took a trip by the manager before that would happen.  He was very gracious and blamed it on the waitress not knowing the menu nor knowing the proper instructions to give to the waitstaff.  Memo to management: make sure your service staff know your menus as well as how to work a table as they are the face of your organization.

At the end, to top everything else off the printer on the electronic thing they use at each table was broken and wouldn't spit out a receipt.  Denisse didn't know how to print one from the main register, either, and it took a while to get out of there.

There are lots of burger places around the nation, but after this experience I seriously doubt I will ever try another Red Robin."}
{"text":"We've gone there twice this month. Both times, our experience was impeccable! We enjoyed the friendly employees who actually take the time to chat but at the same time remained attentive to all their  customers!  Our orders came out in less than 15 minutes and was super fresh and tasty!

I had read the other reviews in the last couple of months and was not sure what to expect, but we have no complaints with this Red Robin!

The temperature inside the restaurant was chilly to me, but most AZ restaurants are! As for the little computer on the table, I'm not a fan, but so many other businesses have gone to them as well! These facts will have no impact on my judgment and rating of this restaurant!

Oh, one last thing........Why can't Red Robin open up a restaurant in Yuma, AZ.???"}
{"text":"We love this place. It's always super clean. It's feels amazing.( little cold though). Amazing prices. Just a great place to be for a quick hunger fix."}
{"text":"Very poorly managed. I just can't recommend this location until they get their act together. Yes they're new, but their seating system and staffing is horrible. We waited 45 minutes for what was stated as 20 minute wait. We left. What a mess."}
{"text":"I wanted to leave a review of Down Town Summerlin, but I couldn't find it. Since we are at Red Robin though, this will work. Harrison our server was great and seriously one of the best waiters we have ever had. Food was also excellent and we didn't have to wait very long. As we were leaving though, the roaming acidity guard was in the processing of giving a motorcyclist a ticket for parking his motorcycle up against the building on the sidewalk (not in anyone's way). In the process of doing this, he parked half way in a handicapped space so he could write the ticket. To add some irony, he was mouthing off about how lazy people are. I tend to agree with him about the laziness of people these days, but laziness is not why that guys parked his motorcycle there. The security guard was just being a douche and he seemed to be tight with Red Robin's management too."}
{"text":"Very impressed by this Red Robin. Its a new location and typically new places struggle, well not this place. The service, the food and the restaurant are on point. Very clean restaurant, including the restrooms. I like Red Robin and have always believed their burgers to be great. This location didn't disappoint, my angus burger was cooked to a perfect medium. They kept the fries coming until we said we are good. Definitely recommend this place in mood for a burger and even a restaurant."}
{"text":"Red Robin is always a good place to go.  The freckled lemonades keep us coming back.

Any of the burgers are good, the onion rings, and the salads.  My go to menu item is the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap.  My husband and I like to split it (it comes cut in half) and with the bottomless (and delish) steak fries we can get in and out of there without dropping tons of cash.

You can't go wrong with the Clucks & Fries either."}
{"text":"The hostess was not that great we asked for a booth and she complained that she'd have to clean one if we really wanted it. So we just gave in and got sat at table 113 which according to her was a compromise because it was a half booth. The waitress Dana J. in the bar area was quick to attend to us. We ordered our food. My burger was a bit on the spicy side for me so I only ate 2 bites. The waitress noticed that I hadn't eaten much and asked if everything was okay I told her it was a bit spicy for me. She offered to replace it, but since we were leaving I said I was fine. She was great she offered to make me one to go. That was great she went above and beyond to make my experience wonderful."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you're looking for a wide selection of yummy burgers and fun drinks! There are multiple pages of burgers with all kinds of toppings and preparations.  I ordered the burger with bbq sauce, onion straws, and cheese, but it was a really tough decision! The burger came out moist and juicy and filled with flavor.  The fries are also scrumptious... They are never-ending which is an interesting concept but I'm not sure who has enough room left to order seconds! 

We split the onion ring tower for an appetizer, and it comes with ranch and a second sauce that I loved so much I asked for more to dip my fries in!  The drinks menu is extensive and includes milkshakes (delicious), root beer floats (unlimited refills!), and all kinds of cool alcoholic concoctions that made me want to come back and try some more. 

Overall, this is a chain restaurant that does not taste like one!"}
{"text":"Seriously...you are just better off going to Wendy's or Whataburger down the street and sitting inside if you want a burger...their burgers are better, their service is faster, the bill is cheaper.  

My hamburger last night was clearly two frozen patties grilled with toppings. I make these at home or on weekends all the time. 

The value for quality isn't there."}
{"text":"I do not recommend ordering food that is take out. Dining in is fine. Unfortunately a lot of sit in restaurants do not take care of customers that order and pick up their food. This is one of those places.  Not great customer service, rude hostesses, cold food, charging different prices than the menu online and management that doesn't make anything right. Ordered here a few times now while at work and have been disappointed each time. Will no longer be a patron of this location."}
{"text":"I love the food and the staffs are amazing 
Best place to eat and with catch up with friends to chat and have a good time"}
{"text":"Was not special.  This parking lot in same area as the theater and all of the other food businesses.  Not sure who is responsible but the clean up of these lots is absolutely terrible.  This restaurant was clean.  The restroom could have stood a touch up.  The server wasn't rude but really wasn't anything special.  My wife got one refill and I never was offered a refill on my iced tea.  The food was ok.  My wife's burger seemed undercooked and was definitely a frozen patty.  My chicken wrap was ok.  The chili had a nice little bite to it.  The server asked my wife if she wanted more fries after she knew we were done with the meal.  Overall this particular RR location is not as good as others we have been to."}
{"text":"stopped in on our way home from tubing the Salt River.   Sunday afternoon and we expected busy.  However, either they were extremely understaffed or the service is extremely poor.  Took almost 30 mins for everyone in my party to get our first drinks.  3 root beer floats and an iced tea.  Didn't even take our order for food until after that.  So about an hour into this experience we finally got our food.  The food was not bad.  Then came this stupid electronic box thingy on our table.  We were supposed to be able to request refills on it, we could not.  For whatever reason they were not in there.  We were supposed to be able to split up our bill.  We could not.  The gadget was not taking the credit card,  It was not giving a receipt.  All we wanted to do was stop and grab a burger before we all went our separate way home.  The food is what we have come to expect with Red Robin.  Not terrible.  The service and experience at this location was terrible.  I would not do out of my way for this location. The 2 rating is because of the food otherwise it was a 1"}
{"text":"Other visits here have been better.  Tonight the service was slow and bad.  Everything we asked for had to come in separate waves, causing our food to become cold before sauces arrived.  The place was busy, but with service like this, it will not stay busy."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of Red Robin.  I love their burgers and I love their fries.  It's a real bummer that the last few times we've gone for lunch we've  noticed that both the service and the food quality aren't what they once were.  It's hard to put my finger on exactly what the problem is, but the burgers and sides just aren't as good (lower quality of ingredients perhaps?  Less fresh maybe?)

As far as the service goes our waitress really did try, but they seemed like they were understaffed, and the hostess kept seating people in her section.  At any rate the service was slow and we were ignored most the time.

I think this last trip to Red Robin really will be our last.  Plenty of other places to get it decent burger around here."}
{"text":"Taste is average and price is expensive for those foods.Actually i wont go there,1 time is enough for me.Burgers taste is almost same as mc donalds"}
{"text":"The veggie burger is the truth great Service super fast delivery of food would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I stopped by for dinner with a colleague on a Wednesday night while working in the area. We arrived before 6 pm and the place wasn't too busy. We were seated immediately at a small booth. Both the hostess and our server, Ashlee, were really friendly. Ashlee was also efficient, getting our orders down and our food out quickly. 

I'd been to other Red Robin locations before so there weren't many surprises; the food was tasty but nothing too remarkable. There is a wide variety of burgers, and a small number of options if you want to reduce your caloric intake or want a non-burger entrée. I was able to get pineapple slices on my cheeseburger for just $0.49 extra, which was nice. My coworker got the BLTA croissant with aioli dip for $0.75 extra. If you have a big appetite, the bottomless fries are a bonus.

Our total bill came out to be just over $28 after tax and 20% tip (no desserts or drinks). We were able to pay using the pin pad at the table. I had the receipt emailed and it took several minutes to come through, but I did get it eventually. The restaurant was pretty clean and there was a family restroom in addition to men's and ladies' rooms. There was plenty of seating.

Overall, a decent place to get a tasty, if average, meal. There was abundant parking in the shopping center in which the restaurant is located."}
{"text":"Our food was great, the atmosphere was great, & our host was great. I actually only seen my waitress twice, & she never introduced herself to us. So who my server was, I have no idea!! Luckily, Emily took great care of us & served our food & drinks. Very good visit thanks to Emily!!!"}
{"text":"While in NC had to try red robin and I'm glad I did! Went late at night so the place was empty. I see others post about slow service and I can agree but I don't have NY expectations when I travel. Once we ordered it came up fast. 

I had the burger with an egg on top ( forgot the name) and I thought it was so good! My
Boyfriend had a bacon cheeseburger. We both left full and satisfied. If you're looking for a cheap bite I would recommend heading this way."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic, Lisa was our server.. very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Did you know you can get a petite version of any burger? The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because they only knock a dollar off for the smaller burger size. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Vegas from the east coast and was pleasantly surprised when I drove by a Red Robin a couple of times. I finally decided to stop in, and I don't know if I came on a bad night but I was not impressed. Mostly because of the cleanliness or lack thereof. I sat at the bar which is within the smallest section of the restaurant and counted 4 tables that were empty but still had the dirty dishes on them. The entire bar was dirty as well, and even once I sat down, no effort was made to clean it.  This was all an hour and a half before closing."}
{"text":"I want to preface this review by reminding the reader that I am a 23 year old grad-school student who does not have a stick up his ass.

This Red Robin is my favorite kind of place.  And it's not about the food or the drink; it's the setting.  This is the place where I can walk in, just sit at the bar and chat with the employees.  It'd be nice if they were allowed to drink with me, but what can you do.  Anyway, it's very informal and that's what I want.  I dislike the whole customer-server relationship; it leads to an awkward \"hey you're cool but fetch me some ketchup\" kind of attitude.

I've casually chatted with several of the people who work here and we talk as equals.  It's feels less that they are there to service my drinking whims, but more like we're there to make the time pass by a little faster.  For me it's usually because I'm stalling to be somewhere I don't want to be; for them it's because they are at work.  However it's just really relaxed and more like chatting with the same buddy you see regularly at the bus stop.

Regardless; onto the food!  The burgers are delicious, the fries aren't half bad, and I really (read: REALLY) like their honey-mustard.  I suggest the guacamole burger (if you swing that way) but I'd safely say that most of their food is good.  It's like a delicious diner, but without the feelings of shame and guilt for being there, drunk, at three in the morning.

Definitely a place I enjoy being a regular when I need to relax with a beer and not sit home."}
{"text":"I love obnoxious, screaming kids.  The more rambunctious and unruly the better.  The place gives out balloons, has an awesome Red Robin mascot, and a sliver of arcade games to occupy the little (and bigger) monsters.  What can your neighborhood family casual restaurant do?

We usually share their tower of onion rings, with the crispy breading and sweet Spanish onion, dipped in ranch or some other awesome sauce.  We also get the side salads with balsamic vinaigrette, but wilted iceberg lettuce can be hit or miss.

Those chunky steak fries are rockstar good.  Why else would they keep the seasoned salt at the table?"}
{"text":"I am regular @ this location. Food was good and fries were hot. The server was not the friendly but hostess was lovely. Definitely will go for lunch since it is convinent to my job. LOVE THE FREE BIRTHDAY SANDWICH  AND BOGO ON TUESDAY."}
{"text":"The food was good but service was horrible. Our bartender/server had an attitude. We ordered appetizers and drinks 10 minutes before our actual order and we didn't get them until our main orders were done. So it defeated the purpose of ordering appetizers. Very sloe service. I have been to other red Robins and got way better service so when I tried this location I expected the same."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service, incorrectly prepared orders and DIRTY!  I was treated so poorly during one visit, I was given a free gift card to return. On my return visit my order was cooked improperly. When I pointed out on a separate visit that the orange wedge served with my Blue Moon beer was rotten, the waitress SHRUGGED and walked away. Thank you so much for taking a franchise I used to love and making me loathe it to my core."}
{"text":"Great service! Was seated fast and friendly by Jannine. Our server Kayla was polite and refilled our drinks quickly. Everything was fast and good. The pretzel bites were delicious and the chocolate \"fruffle\" sticks for desert were to die for!! 

10/10 will come back!"}
{"text":"Bummer visit. Went on a Saturday night but it was late enough to avoid the really big crowds. Got a table in 10 mins. 
Asked for a gluten free menu, which Red Robin is really good at. My wife ordered a GF burger, no onions, no cheese and a side salad instead of fries. I ordered the prime rib dip with fries and cole slaw.  We also asked for silverware and napkins since they were missing. 

Our order arrived in about 10 mins, still no napkins or silverware. Got those after five more mins. My wife's burger had onions (no cheese) but the biggie: her salad had croutons!  Really?  The server had even asked if she preferred a GF bun or if she was gluten allergic. I SAW him write down allergic!  My sandwich was tasty but they were obviously getting rid of stale bread. I know the difference between toasted and stale too. Good thing I had the au jus. 

Lastly, my endless fries and bottomless lemonade?  Never saw the waiter again until he brought us the bill. 

I'm done with that Red Robin. Obviously they don't care."}
{"text":"To summarize:

- 90-minute wait (after being told 30-40 minutes)
- Can't have burgers cooked medium-rare
- Food is average at best
- Food is over-priced
- Floor is filthy
- \"Craft beer\" list is lacking
- Manager is extremely rude (but, wait staff and receptionists were trying their best!)

How does someone start a new restaurant and let it get this bad this quickly?

This location has ruined not only their own reputation, but the reputation of the entire chain."}
{"text":"Service was very good, Food is good to. We like to eat here always try something new. We didn't have burgers this evening. I did miss the fries.  Had a wrap and a salad was filling."}
{"text":"Best onion rings i have ever had in my life hands down!!! They have lots of different burgers, something for everyone! Good service and great food!"}
{"text":"I love this red robin. The bartender is very attentive and always makes sure you enjoy your drink. I wasn't a fan of the actual dining room as it was kinda crowded and the waitresses were everywhere but your table.  Unlike the main dining room, the bar is 21 and over and actually asks you if you want bottomless fries with your order."}
{"text":"Though the food is good, it's the seating that gets me. The last two times we go, they sit us at the bar. I don't mind sitting at the bar but when your 9 months pregnant, climbing the really high chairs and booths feels like Mount Everest. They could of just sat me and my boyfriend at the plenty of two person booths they had or be more considerate and sat us in a place where I don't have to get helped up.

I don't like the way the bar area is set up, your literally right on top of the party next to you which makes it worst when your 9 months pregnant and barely can fit in the long booth. No one wants to be that close to each other unless its a group of friends. Like if I put my elbow down its nearly touching the person next to me and you can even join in the conversation if you wanted. That setting is great for an actual bar if you want to socialize and bring people home but not when your enjoying dinner with your boyfriend. 

I will be back cause I love their burgers but I rather sit in the kiddie section where I actually have room to move around."}
{"text":"I was at this location yesterday and had a fabulous bartender, David.  He was prompt and friendly.  He brought me a red sauce with the sweet potato fries, and I loved it.  Although it comes with the fries, this is the first time in about 10 visits (always in the bar area) that was done. The sauce is delicious, be sure to ask for it, if they forget to bring it.  He's to be complimented on his positive attitude, and I hope he's there next time I visit.
Update: I mistakenly initially checked 1 star, it should have been 5!"}
{"text":"Really good at what they do.  Good food and bottomless fries and drinks.  The shakes here are really good as well.   Quite good for a casual chain restaurant."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to grab a quick drink and a burger, you shouldn't be disappointed. While not nearly my favorite burger place in Pittsburgh, it's quick and easy and the food is generally dependable. 

Some go-to staples for me are the Whiskey River bbq chicken wrap, the turkey burger, and the classic burger with cheddar. I don't go for any of the goopy sauces here, but there are several to choose from. The steak fries are always hot and tasty, and they are all-you-can-eat. Sometimes you just need all-you-can-eat fries!

I really enjoy the flavored iced teas they offer as well. You can get sugar free or regular raspberry, peach, or pomegranata added to your black iced tea (Gold Peak). It's a really yummy option. I also enjoy the freckled lemonade with strawberries. Yum!

Stop in if you're looking for a quick burger and hot fries."}
{"text":"For those of you who want to be seated quickly, have good service, don't have kids with you and don't want to see other people's kids, a piece of advice: sit in the bar. As with BJs right down the street, you can seat yourself at the high top tables in the bar or directly at the bar. Service is quick. Doesn't make the food any better, but it makes the experience tolerable.

Anyway, the food: I just discovered my adoration of any burger with a fried egg on it. RR has one and it's tasty. The rest of the food is fast-food quality. Even the burned fries are soggy. 

RR is good for a quick bite when you don't really care too much about what you're eating. Just remember to sit in the bar."}
{"text":"There quite a few things I really like about Red Robin. Their onion rings are amazing their shakes are to die for and the burgers are actually really good. The only problem is they are too pricey! Add to that the caloric value of their food does not make it very waistline friendly lol. My wife and I try to monitor our calorie intake, and this prevents us from eating here except on a rare occasion. But price and calories aside this place is great!"}
{"text":"The hostess was not very friendly and kept telling us five minutes for our table. When I tried to ask what was going on with our table she rudely cut me off. I didn't get her name she was young female, boy haircut, and tattoos . When we finally did get seated the waitress was amazing. Food took a while and was room temperature at best but I ate what I could because I was just ready to go. I would possibly try it again because the waitress was really sweet but that's only if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I went to lunch by myself it was a great. I had a chicken sandwich with the bottomless steak fries. My server was great. I love how they have the little kiosks on the tables now where you can play games and pay and even call your server."}
{"text":"Great food. 
Friendly service. 
They took away the Chicken Caprese sandwich which bummed me out."}
{"text":"The food is great altho I never sit down and eat. I always take my food to go. I give this place five stars plus an extra 5.  I can find healthy choices :) The salad is good huge chicken slices and veggies after you eat here you wont be hungry. I love that each and everytime you order you must wait thats because they cook the food to order. Can you say good hot food?! When you need a snack its a great place to get something. I gave it five stars so you know the place is clean and the staff are just wonderful."}
{"text":"This place seems a bit overrated. The burgers are good but not enough to pay what they are currently bring charged at. Customer service could definitely be better though because our waitress had a terrible attitude."}
{"text":"Went to the soft opening tonight and if this is how the service and kitchen is after just one service, they have obviously been very well trained!  I have been to the North Olmsted location and this new store is already better in both service and food.  We will be back often."}
{"text":"Just another average visit to Red Robin. The service staff is still just ok and the food is the same as it always is. I would love for them to wow me sometime and I guess that's why I keep going back; because I am hoping that THIS VISIT will be the WOW visit and I won't have to keep coming back. At some point my brain is going to have to tell my heart that it's just not going to happen and I should spend my money elsewhere but I don't see that happening anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sarah at the hostess desk has lost control of the seating process.  Wants people to sign in for bar too, but let's people jus walk in and take seats in the bar.  In the 10 minutes we waited, never saw a manager check on things.  SMH."}
{"text":"Again the customer service was worth five stars but I am rating the restaurant not just the service!  My sister enjoyed her burger, I am no longer a hamburger eater, so I had grilled chicken.   It was fair at best,  I know this is a burger place but you can't just be a restaurant with just one trick! Service was great,  customers were great too?...for the most part!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience we have had in a long time. Burgers were just ok. First the hostess took way too long to seat us and was in no rush to get customers in even though it was busy. The food was just ok. For the price I think it was not worth it and I would have enjoyed in-n-out much more. Then when it came time to pay, we waited for 20 minutes to get out of that place. I will never return..."}
{"text":"First time at this Red Robin. Arrived at 11:35 on a Friday for lunch. The place was hopping. Really good sign. 

I was seated within 3 minutes but was led to the bar area. Nervous since you often get poor service there. The bartender took my order 5 mins later: Burning Love Burger and a coke. 

My drink arrived quickly of course but lunch didn't arrive until 17 minutes later.  I cut my burger in half like always but that was a mistake: they had broken the patty into three pieces, so now I had numerous pieces. Every time I tried to take a bite, it fell apart. I ended up eating my burger with a knife and fork which wasn't as appetizing. 

My service really fell apart too. Since he was the bartender, the only other time I saw him was when he gave me the bill. 

For a burger, which was in three pieces, fries and a coke, with no service, to cost me $12 plus tip, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I haven't had Red Robin in so long, only god knows why because the burgers are delicious! I had the Burnin' Love burger which was very tasty! Then of course I had to get the garlic dipping sauce for the fries (great choice)! Staff is friendly and the burgers are full of flavor. Definitely left feeling very full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"I love the new restaurant design!!! It's cool!! Definitely a much needed face lift. Friendly staff!! Fast service! Clean restaurant. Delicious food!!! We like their rewards system. Good location. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We frequent this location and the one in Peoria but, this is the location closest to our home. The service is always outstanding.  From the host to the server to the management always stellar.  The food is fresh and cooked to our specifications without errors.  The management team does a great job each experience.  Always start with a freckled lemonade!!! Today we did something different and came here for lunch we usually do dinner.  We were warmly greeted by Dominic and promptly brought to our area of choice (always try to sit at the red chairs in the middle of the restaurant... So comfortable). Veronica was an amazing server! Her knowledge of the menu (Dominic was a menu guru too), we never waited for drink refills or anything. The I made a bold decision to try the Red Ramen burger (with an egg, ramen extra crispy) and it was a game changer! I must also commend the manager Natalie as well.  She was so personable and took the time out talk to us and really make us feel welcome.  Veronica did her job so well we tipped 25%+. I can't say enough about the food and experience that we have her every time. Christian is a great server.  We also love the manager Nick! Your guys rock!!! Kudos!!!"}
{"text":"Thisbisbby far the best place! Great food, and great prices.  I had 4 hungry teenagers..the all ate good, and of course the bottomless fries!  With my redeemable points, the bill for 5 was $58.00! My favorite is the fried chicken finger salad!"}
{"text":"My Uncle and I love Red Robins. When we ate here, we had their burgers and they were both very delicious. But what I can't get enough of is their homemade lemonade!"}
{"text":"My review is a bit overdue. I experienced excellent service and tasty, hot food on my visit. Two of us dined and ordered Fish & Chips and Mini Wedge Salads. All good. Cheerful sever - Chelsea. We were here after the dinner rush. I'll eat here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So, I should preface this with sharing the fact that I used to work at Red Robin (for 5 years) and I was a trainer (both in store and on a regional level).

It's been awhile since I've gone to a Red Robin, so either the company model has fallen to the wayside, or my experience today was a fluke.  Either way it was unacceptable.  

My friend and I went, and upon walking in there were 2 employees talking at the host stand..when the Hospo (host) finally acknowledged us, it wasn't with a warm greeting, it was mere eye contact, and dull at that.  Sensing a disconnect, I piped up with \"There's 2 of us Please.\"  He took us to our seats, sat us and told us in a monotone voice that \"your waitress would be right with you.\"  I know it's not a big deal..but at Red Robin, branding is everything..and the wait staff is referred to as \"Servers\".  But whatever.   

Expected the 30 second greet, I was disappointed,  but I remembered what it was like for me sometimes, so I shrugged that off.  Though we did sit there for a good 5 minutes.  Long enough to go back and forth on which burger to order and what to have as a side, etc.  

The server finally got over to us (I kick myself for not remembering her name..I think it was Mitzy or something uncommon.  She was on the older side, Caucasian, brownish hair.)  She was pleasant enough at first.  So we ordered our drinks and placed our food order.  Since it was my friends birthday, she informed the server that she had a credit for a free birthday burger in case it mattered either way.  The server didn't offer any birthday wishes, but instead seemed kind of blah about having us at her table with that new information.  Having been a server for this company that (used to) basically bend over backwards for the guest, I was surprised, but again, whatever.  It's important (and only fair) that I mention that she was never outright RUDE.  

Our food comes, she brings us additional napkins and topped off my iced tea.  At that point I looked around at all the servers to note the collective disposition:  only 1-2 seemed happy or at least GOOD at faking a sense of happiness.  The rest seemed a range from blah to outright angst at having to be there.

The bill comes and the server leaves it without asking for the Loyalty card that had my friends free bday burger credit on it.  I get that perhaps her memory isn't incredibly sharp, so I can't hold that against her.  

We put the card in with the extra payment for our drinks, etc.  She comes, takes it, and brings it back.  It's only as shes turning to walk away from the table do we hear a \"thanks\" in a monotonous tone.  The change was $2 (on a $20 bill discounted down to $7) so that's what we left.  *shrugs*  I didn't feel that she did anything to deserve more.  The final straw of this decision was that she never once said a simple \"Happy Birthday\" to my friend, even after it was mentioned in the beginning and, of course, when she ran the promotional credit for the bday burger.  

Essentially she treated us like we were going to be a waste of her time/not tip well, so I had no issue helping her to fulfill her own self-made prophesy  :-)"}
{"text":"Great food, inside atmosphere is just too loud unless you have children which the noise probably won't bother you.

\"Banzi Burger\" is killer and the other menu favorite of mine is the \"Chicken Ensanada Platter\" with ranch dressing, both are very filling.

Milk shakes are also quite tastey.

The loation is on 101 and Mayo so lunch and a movie on the weekend are great hand in hand."}
{"text":"One of the worst Red Robins we've been to. I ordered grilled onions on my burger. When took the top off there was less than one slice of onion. 
I asked for a side of blue cheese dressing. I was told \"I'll be right back with that \"; the server then proceeded to stand and talk with the manager. We waited several minutes to see if he was going to bring the requested item. All the while my food was cooling! My husband then got up and reminded him of my request. A few minutes later the dressing finally arrived. I have a difficult time understanding why servers don't understand that when a customer requests something to go with their meal they want it quickly, not when the server gets around to it."}
{"text":"Reddddddd Robin.....Yum.

Whiskey River BBQ burger is really all I get here so i cant speak to any other thing.  Its just hard to stray away from that good of a burger.

When I was here most recently, I ordered the sweet potato fries instead of the normal fries....they were great...however they dont have a sauce for them and there is also no brown suger or anything on them to take them to the next level...so you end up with good fries that get bland after about 5. :(  comeon Red Robin, develop a sauce to go with those fries.

As always, the staff was very friendly and attentetive.  I always seem to get good service here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a burger from a chain restaurant this is an excellent pick! I dont like anything fancy on my burger but they have tons of options. Gotta love the bottomless fries too."}
{"text":"My husband has never been a RR fan but was surprisingly pleased with his burger. He had their original burger minus cheese. He said it was tasty and juicy. 

I had turkey croissant. The bread and soft, veggies fresh. I'm always pleased when there's options other than fries without an additional charge. I had the salad with poppyseed dressing. The dressing was a tad sweet for my taste. 

Service was a bit wonky. I must've had my invisible cloak on. Either that or for some reason she was fearful of making eye contact. Luckily another waitress was very pleasant and didn't mind refilling my husband fries. 

My review went from 4 to 3 because of service AND because I find it unacceptable for a restaurant in the dessert not to filter their water. We all need to drink lots of it, especially on days over 105. Their water tasted awful and was undrinkable."}
{"text":"This is the poorest excuse of a restaurant I've ever been to their service sucks and their hostesses are very rude and they have no management whatsoever me and my family will never visit this restaurant again and will discourage anybody else that mentions going to this restaurante."}
{"text":"This place is over priced and nasty!!! I got food poising from a burger. This didn't happen just once but twice. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Nope. I'm pretty sure I will never eat at another Red Robin again. 
Woke up Sunday morning hungover as a mo'fo. Actually, I was probably still drunk. But I wanted food and i wanted football. 
Red Robin was suggested. 
We sat in the bar where they had several tv's, even tho my game wasn't being televised. Damnit. It happens tho. 
I immediately ordered a bloody mary. It was mediocre. Nothing to brag about. 
I couldn't decide what to order. I opted for a chicken sammich. The California Chicken or something? Add jalapenos. 
Friend ordered some type of bbq burger. 
Mine came out and had huge slices of raw jalapeños on it. I don't even mind the fact that the jalapeños were raw, bring the heat! But they were sliced SO thick it just makes them NOT good. The chicken was nearly inedible as well. It tasted super fake and just gross. 
Friend initially said the burger was good, but half way thru came to realize that it actually WASN'T. 
Needless to say I was not at all satisfied with our food choices that morning and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Was recently in the SETTLERS RIDGE location. Hadn't been in there in over a year. As soon as the food arrived I remembered why.
My wife ordered some kind of grilled cheese sandwich which was paper thin and tasteless.  I like big burgers with a lot of spice, so I ordered \"THE BIG GHOST\".  
When it showed up I actually questioned the waitress...\"if this is the BIG GHOST, how small is the regular one?!?!\"  It had about the same amount of meat as a McDonalds hamburger.
I will say this though, the diet pepsi was REALLY GOOD.
Never go there again. With $36 less in our pocket we left the place profoundly disappointed."}
{"text":"Ughhhh the food was served cold...i ordered the shroom burger its so cold feels like them microwave burgers...n the fries were served a totsl of 6 fries wtf....omg never again..."}
{"text":"We went here for my Free Birthday burger with fries and we sat in the bar area.  The whiskey BBq burger and the onion straws were long and stringy and disappointing.  we were happy we could get garlic Aoili sauce with fries though at extra cost and 1 should have been Free with fries.  The burgers are smaller than they used to be"}
{"text":"We were in the area tonight and as a Royalty member with a birthday this month we decided to stop for a quick, affordable dinner. Sign up for a the Royalty club because you get a free burger during your birthday month plus discounts all year long and you earn free items with purchase.

With my member discount we had dinner and sodas for 3 for $20.00 not including tip. You just can't beat that! Plus our burgers were good. I am also a fan of their steak cut fries with ranch dressing. Our server Reyna was very pleasant and attentive. She was always bring refills and more fries."}
{"text":"We come here as a family allllllll the time and every time is better and better!
I had stomach surgery and can eat very little. I'm stuck eating soup and I can't have chunks! This is the first place I been that blended my soup so I could eat! The staff is amazing and so caring!
I love love love this place! 
Thank you all for being so great!!!!!!"}
{"text":"we eat here once or twice a month. The Tavern Double is an excellent deal ($6.99, what's not to love?)  What I love about this place is the service - they are always on top of their game. The last time we were there, I was blown away. Our server was Shane - he really seemed to enjoy his job. He came to our table, and guessed what we wanted - and was dead on. We asked how he knew - and he told us how he could tell.  It's not because he has served us before, he can just tell by the age of the patrons, and his experience with the menu.  With all of the items on that menu, it amazed me. Anyway, the Tavern Double didn't fail to disappoint, Shane was excellent, and we'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"This was a hard review to write. Red Robin was a strange experience from the point I walked in the door to the point I walked out of it. Objectively speaking this is neither bad nor good. But what pushed me to the edge was not the food or the customer experience, but the value of what you're paying for. The food was good and the waitress I had was very pleasant, but the strange part was the portions and pricing comparison. The food you get and the price you pay don't add up whatsoever. A burger and fries alone could be $15.99 like what mine was. If they were going to rob me I'd prefer they do it at gun point. The burger I received was VERY small and the only thing that remotely satisfied me in the end was the endless fries. But I can speak for a lot of people when I say most people don't go to Red Robin for fries. Overall, pleasant experience just not worth the value. Slapping the word \"gourmet\" on it doesn't justify paying that price. If it doesn't bother you, then by all means eat there. But overall, I don't recommend Red Robin to anyone."}
{"text":"This location is always consistent and the burgers are pretty ok. It's neither a WOW or YOW experience but if you're looking for consistency and a family-friendly environment, RR is it."}
{"text":"Always great. Try the Royal Red Robin Burger!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with my GF and her daughter.  We called ahead for check-in and were seated immediately upon arrival -- I was impressed.  We ordered the tower of onion rings as an app and that was good -- the last time we ordered this they were pretty soggy and ugly.  I had the seafood platter and that was good.  My GF had the chicken and chips platter and she liked it too.  My GF's daughter ordered one of their gourmet burgers and she said is was OK too.  But the bottom line is although the service we got was good, the prices are high for \"average\" food.  Not bad, but not impressive.  But to be fair, in my entire life, I have never/ever had a burger that really impressed me.  I love good burgers, but I have never been overly impressed by one."}
{"text":"Went in for their 2 double burger special for $15 with family members for an evening out. Had never visited before and enjoyed the entire experience. It was a tad noisy which is okay, but the food, service and atmosphere were very enjoyable."}
{"text":"The burgers at red robin have gone down significantly compared to when the restaurants first opened. I didn't not finish the burger, not only was the presentation and service horrible, the burger was as bland as flat paint.  Not sure what their am is now or target audience is, but rethink it, fast!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Co worker and I went for lunch we literally work 2 minutes away from this location and we barely made it on time back and we didn't even get to eat anything! I couldn't believe how long it took them
to bring out a simple cheeseburger out and a salad. I will defiantly not be returning here!"}
{"text":"Just not a big fan of this place. I never liked the hamburgers so I tried the fish. Overcooked and dry. Ended up not eating the fish and filling up on the fries. Thanks for nothing. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Even though the food is great, this particular location is super disorganized for some reason. I've been here 3 times, and the service is always slackin as if they don't have enough staff. Particularly when seated in the back area, it's like the land of the forgotten. The manager did come around and asked if we had been helped, but we were like nope not at all. No waitress was assigned to us and we were just sitting there. Seems like they are trying to get better at their service, but it's really hit or miss."}
{"text":"We don't have many Red Robin's in Connecticut so we always stop here when I'm visiting in Charlotte. I was disappointed they didn't have the pretzel rolls anymore. The few times I have eaten here, I have had very good meals. The restaurant is extremely crowded, and noisy but the food and prices make up for it."}
{"text":"I had a gift card. 

And a hungry almost-3-year-old. 

So we had ourselves a little date. 

Just Mommy and him. He had the corn dog. Mommy had the bleu cheese burger. (Which didn't taste very bleu to Mommy.) 

Baby boy enjoyed Red the Robin (clever name, that) who was walking around handing out high-fives. 

Total kid-friendly chain. Loud. Very loud. Almost unbearable. Hard to hear my kids \"NOMS\" and \"I wike dis corn dog, Mommy!\" from just across our tiny table. 

My kid was angelic compared to some of the others in there. That was a first. (I ain't all high and mighty. My kid is a brat sometimes, too.) But yeah, totally take your kids here if they're unruly little shits in restaurants. It will go almost completely unnoticed. The wait staff have adjusted and even fine-tuned themselves to it. 

Bottomless fries for fat, American asses. (I didn't get a refill cuz I'm not THAT fat.) 

In closing:  Typical chain. Greasy burgers. Sensory assault from all angles. Nothing special. At all."}
{"text":"First time here , food is great , I had the burnin' love burger and I say is the most AMAZING burger I ever had !!! 
We had Nathan as server today , great guy , provided us with excellent service !!"}
{"text":"The food was cold when it arrived but the server brought fresh fries (I didn't tell her my sandwich was cold because I was hungry and didn't want to wait for it to be remade). Service was good but not great. Didn't live the tortilla soup but the BBQ chicken wrap was good. Husband said burger and fries were good."}
{"text":"Having a nice lunch with my kids. The steak fries are the best with the garlic parm over them as well as the garlic aioli. Burgers are always juicy and the meal is always on time. Our waiter could have used a happy pill because it was the beginning of the lunch time but over all we had a great time. My burger was delicious. Just the way I make it at home. Mushrooms with carmalized onion, lettuce, tomato, and avocado.  yummm"}
{"text":"Returned to this location at 12pm with Mom, in the hopes of having a much better Red Robin adventure. Ordered a Turbo Q Tavern Double with sweet potato fries and roasted garlic aioli. Mom picked up a Nacho Tavern Double and margarita. 

The food definitely met RR standards yet again, as it was incredibly delicious. This location gets the food down. It's the service I was worried about. Fortunately Anna was a dream come true. There are two Annas but our Anna had long black hair and the cutest glasses. Was very attentive, explained things and didn't make us feel like we were bothering her. Vastly superior service against our last visit.

5 stars for Anna because if there's a Red Robin that makes less than superb food, it needs to go out of business."}
{"text":"Food was great , service was poor. Waiter assumed no one wanted a refill or more fries. Jerk"}
{"text":"This is my first time to this location.  Over all, they are just like the other Red Robin locations.  Great burgers, unlimited fries and unlimited freckled lemonade.  Something I did learn about the Red Robin menu is that you can substitute steamed broccoli, cole slaw, sweet potato fries, or side salad for the regular fries and still receive unlimited refills!  Also, I have to say that this location has extremely clean bathrooms!  No odors and all of the stalls looked freshly cleaned!  Our food arrived within less than 10 minutes and our waitress was excellent.  Another note about Red Robin in general is that they offer both Boca Burgers and Garden Burgers as free substitutes to beef."}
{"text":"Such a happy place.  When I have kids, I'm taking them here to get a balloon and to be happy. 

I had the Ensanada plate... two chicken breasts (nice spice to them) and a salad.  It was very yummy for low carb me. 

Service was awesome... we had extra drinks available for our consumption before we were even half way done with our first ones.

Food came out quick as well."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd and FINAL visit to this place......in my previous review I had stated how bad our 1st visit was, BUT, we gave them a 2nd chance and everything was great (please read previous review)......However, today was our 3rd visit and DEFINITELY our LAST. Our experience today was awful. Hostess seated us at a dirty table. Server came, she was very nice. Drinks and Apps were fine, BUT, we had no silverware....we ordered  dinner.....I just got a bacon cheeseburger and OVER EMPHASIZED well well well done.....burnt........as I always do.......Dinners arrived......I picked up burger, bun was DRENCHED in grease......just a wet, soggy, terrible mess......stuff just dripping off it.....I squeezed the burger......BLOOD RED......blood and grease just ooooozed from it......it was a total disgusting mess.....the bottom of bun was literally soaked and falling apart......saturated with BLOOD and grease.....I quickly returned it to server and owing to my policy on such things......asked it be removed from bill and I did not seek a replacement dinner.......I have a long history in food service and WILL NOT EVER return anything to be re-cooked, replaced, etc......I have seen toooooooo much in the places I've worked......so I order very specific.....(burnt) and the place gets one shot at getting it right or I leave hungry.......NO exceptions......ever.....my hubby didnt really like his dinner, saying it was just 'eh ok'......there was no ketchup on the table for fries.....we asked and got it......my mom didn't like her dinner at all saying it was 'unedible'.....we paid the bill and left......Manager did come to apologize, citing a new crew in back, he was nice....but this was our last visit. Terrible. Horrible. Disgusting. Place is obviously a gamble......great once, disaster next time, etc etc etc.......we are too busy to take chances......we'll never return to this place.  Just awful."}
{"text":"Great customer service. My food was messed up and the manager remade it and took it off my bill. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We went here on Friday evening around 5 p.m. There was only a five minute wait. We were seated and after a few minutes the server came over. He had our drinks back in a timely manner. We ordered the boneless chicken wings as an appetizer. Then, our server disappeared... We waited and waited... We even hit the \"Call Server\" button on the kiosk at the table thinking that would help. Nope. Our server finally came over and we placed our orders for two burgers. Someone else delivered the boneless wings. They were overcooked and chewy. Our burgers were OK and the french fries were cold. I had to wait for the ranch I requested. At the end of our meal, we used the kiosk to pay. I needed a box, but the server still didn't come around. He finally came over after we waived at him. Not once did I see a manager.  Overall, this experience was terrible. And, this isn't the first time. As, we sat there waiting... We looked at each other and said, this is why we don't come here... I'm noticing this is a pattern with the Red Robin locations that I visit. With so many restaurant choices out there, they have lost my business. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"For once the service was good! It's a miracle. Ben was a great server. He was attentive and we really didn't need to ask for anything. As soon as we were low on refills, he said I'll bring you a refill. I asked for additional napkins and he brought those too! This was such a rare occurrence to receive excellent customer service that we told the Kitchen Manager that Ben was doing a good job. We should've told the manager, but we didn't see one. Hopefully, the Kitchen Manager will tell the General Manager. Obviously from looking at previous reviews, no one checks their Yelp reviews. Because if they did they would be contacting customers about their terrible experiences."}
{"text":"This review is almost entirely based upon my emphasis of being a vegetarian. If I ate meat, maybe I'd be cool with getting a burger elsewhere but this place has the ever elusive veggie burger as a substitute with any gourmet burger on the menu and they are DAMN good.

Some things about Red Robin are less than satisfactory. Yes, it's loud. Yes, there is a lot of annoying chain cliches from your server asking if you've ever ate at RR before, every single time. The servers are good at being friendly and thus doing their job. I can't say I've ever had an incredible wait for either food, a server or my bill. They sing Happy Birthday! quite often which can also be quite annoying. There is often groups from sporting events, whatever that can be quite loud. But, did I mention, the vegetarian burger is DAMN good? This place is not like Denny's /Perkin's because they offer a vegetarian main course that is amazing(I didn't care much for Denny's Boca burger.)

The prices are a little high. Drinks and appetizers can tack on a lot. That said, the burger is damn good so who cares."}
{"text":"Wow! I cannot believe how much the service has improved since I was last here.

Our server, Alissa, was so much better than our previous server a few months ago. She was attentive, nice, and a pleasure to be around.

The manager came to our table to check if everything was alright, and it was! She also came back a little later and helped us with an issue we were having with the tabletop POS. Two other gentlemen also stopped by our table and they were awesome too.

The food improved since last time I was here. The bottomless fries were hot and fresh. We ordered a few baskets of those, they were great. My burger was excellent as well and it was cooked to perfection.

All in all, Red Robin on S. Eastern has improved!! Thanks to all the staff for picking it up!!"}
{"text":"I had the Black and Blue burg, the wife had a Bonzai burg. Both very good and flavorful. Server Alex was very attentive. We love the new decor. We will be back."}
{"text":"They were very busy with the noonday crowd, but 3 waiters came over to take our orders or to let us know that we were not forgotten. 
I had a bacon cheese burger. Fabulous. Wife had her fave, the Bonzai burger. 

Food yummy, service fantastic. 

We left, full and happy!"}
{"text":":( 

I just want to start with a sad face because I love red robin and I came here as a cheat day for myself. I didn't finish my food. 

Food: 
I ordered a pepper burger and my bf ordered a tavern. We ordered ours medium rare. I got mine well done and he received his medium well. My burger was so charred I had to return it and ask for a new one. When I revieced my new one, it was still pretty well done but at least it wasn't charred so I took a few bites and called it a day. 

Atmosphere:
Everyone was dragging their feet and there was no silverware on the tables. Our hands were filthy and we had to go up to the bar to get napkins. It seemed like we had to ask for everything here. Our server was nice but slow. 

I will not be coming back. Kitchen staff needs to learn how to make burgers below well done or not bother asking what we want."}
{"text":"We had a terrible dining experience on a busy Friday. The restaurant was extremely understaffed with, it seemed like, one waitress for the whole restaurant. After waiting for almost an hour, we finally got our food but it had obviously been sitting for a long time and was cold and tasteless. When I asked to have my meal reheated it took 20 minutes to get it back. Upon checkout we learned that one has to check out via the table-side tv/computer which malfunctioned, and since we couldn't find our server, it took another 20 minutes to get the check. Save yourself and stay away at peak times!"}
{"text":"The food is always top notch but the speed of the cooks is a joke. The wait staff has to frequently apologize for the kitchen. But I'll be back because its a good burger."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best dirty birds around. Always able to get in and out super quick. Very pleasant staff and great bar team."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week. We do however only sit in the bar, away from the kids. All the staff is friendly and courteous, making sure we have what we need and in a timely manner. Our food is always fresh and hot, it does not sit under a heat lamp unattended. 

I really love they have a new burger out monthly to try, something new and different and a little foo foo, but always a good distraction from the normal menu even though I am always good with the Burning Love Burger.

My only suggestion to better things would be to put the ice cream machine and the shake station somewhere else other than the bar. The bartenders should not be bogged down making milk shakes and chocolate milk. I am sure someone else could do it in another area of the resturant. Free the bartenders up to deal with the phone orders and make drinks."}
{"text":"I love their burgers and fries!  My current favorite burger is the Tavern Burger.  I love that they have never ending fries.  Not the healthiest choice but great comfort food.  The price is about average for a burger restaurant.  I haven't been there for happy hour, but the menu/pricing looks good."}
{"text":"My husband, mother in law, my son, and myself came here today to have lunch. Our server was on top of things at the start. We had ordered the chips, salsa, and guacamole. We didn't eat it, because my husband tried the guacamole and said it tasted canned. He knows it didn't taste, or look right .. Especially because he works at Chipotle where they make it fresh everyday! We had her take it back. Our food arrives and everything is delicious. Then this big group of kids come in. They were being loud, obnoxious , and they were squirting ketchup into their mouth straight from the bottles. That is so unbelievably disgusting!! They were popping balloons on purpose. Mind you, We have our 4month old son with us. !With all that happening, we were waiting for our check. It took ATLEAST 30 minutes for us to receive it because our server decided to take the big groups order. Terrible service towards the end. Hadn't been here in like 2years, it was not a great experience coming back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times my wife likes it but the service is hit or miss. Would not recommend going any night it might be busy because it is very slow. The food is ok and you get endless sides like broccoli or salad or fries. Last time I went the service was horrible. I never got my water refilled until my wife walked up to the manager even after asking our waiter twice. The burger came with barely any firs like they ran out. No big deal right you can order more right, only it took manager intervention again after waiting almost 20 minutes for more. Overall the horrible service really ruined the evening and meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. The burgers and salads are ALWAYS tasty. I love the variety they offer in a burger, the salads are really fresh and nothing beats the bottomless steak fries. The servers are friendly and never let you have an empty glass!"}
{"text":"The food can be hit or miss. I really like the royal robin burger when it's cooked properly. The food aside, the service was terrible. Maybe they are understaffed or something not sure but they need to do a better job. Slow service and bad service is a treacherous combo. No bueno. I'd avoid if I were you. Not a good value for the cost."}
{"text":"I love Burgers & Beer. I love Beer and good food. The Burnin Love Burger at Red Robin rocks! The flavor is all over the place. I can say this about most of their burgers although this burger takes the cake. Oh wait, I forgot I added some of the fried jalapenos from my friends plate into the burger. Yum!

I prefer to sit at the bar to avoid being distracted from my delicious food by the \"oh so lovely kids.\" The bartenders are always Awesome with the specialty drinks Red Robin throws out every so often. One thing I love is that they are cool when I ask to try one of the special drinks and they make a mini.  Although I would recommend the Mug Drafts!"}
{"text":"Red Robin is exactly what it sets out to be... a great family burger place.  It really is a perfect atmosphere to bring the kids, loud enough to drown out any individual kid cries.  I've loved every burger I've ever got.  This time I got the MadLove burger and it was delish.  The avocado was all green and perfect ripeness, something that seems hard to come by in restaurants.  The Parmesan garlic fries are my fave.  Kids were happy.  Service was good.  All and all a perfect family Sunday night."}
{"text":"If I could give it less than one star I would.Today my daughter and I went for lunch at the mentioned location. I happened to have a coupon for 50% and entree or specialty burger. We had a tavern burger and the entree of fish and chips. I was told that the Tavern Burger is not a specialty burger. When the coupon was applied, it took it off the tavern burger instead of the entree. Our waiter did not come back for some time, so I asked a waitress who was going to process the same coupon for someone else about the issue. She came back and said the manager said it is an automatic discount and they have no control over it. The manager did not come over for several minutes, actually until I had already paid.  He apologized but stated he did not control the situation; he said he could not override it, actually after a long conversation admitting I was the first to complain that he was not going to override it.  He did say if he did 400 per month corporate would be asking why. The manager's name is Cody. He stated he is going to stand by his management team and not correct the bill.  I advised I would not be returning again and I would be sure to tell everyone one I knew about how this was handled. An additional $3.50 discount would have preserved my continued business and well as many other I know. With an average check of at minimum $25, your company lost the business of many more customers beyond me. I have no problem telling others about superior service and extremely poor service. Was called by local manager today who stood by their decision. They could not give more of a discount as then all the servers would want the same thing for their customers. They said that they did sent the coupon issue to their corporate office. Still no real sorry or empathy."}
{"text":"Unlimited fries, need I say more? Well.......ok.

The food is pretty good for a burger joint. The only downside, if I had to say, would be some of the wait staff. I always love the food but sometimes waiting for my server to give us a refill or even the bill can be taxing. Especially during the time where we had to wait almost an hour for our bill, even though we were one of 3 couples in the restaurant at the time."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service by the manager. I would rate the restaurant only one star because of the manager Rebecca that called my husband and I are after the restaurant had a mix-up with our to go order. When my husband originally called regarding the mix-up the hostess was pleasant. However then we got a quick phone call back by Rebecca the manager. Rebecca stated that the mix-up was my fault because I did not check my bag before I left. She told my husband that was my responsibility. I spoke to her and she told me that this was their new method of soinf thinhs they did not check the orders and just give the bags to the customer."}
{"text":"Red, white and bleu salad was super yum and a great addition to the menu! This location was clean with great service and food served at just the right temps! Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos! When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!"}
{"text":"Went last week and WOW.  DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY, a few tips;  clean your bathrooms and your place wont be such a dive.  Also, not everyone is an idiot.  I had fruit flies in my drink and pointed it out to the server.  I told her that's ok I will just drink water.  5 min later she came back with a drink.  I told her I didn't want it and she said that the manager told her that I would still have to pay for the drink so she had a new one made.  I asked her if they used a new bottle and she said yes but she wasn't a very good liar.  So I told her to show me the new bottle. She went to the bar and the bartender shook her head, called another employee over and held the \"old\" bottle up in the air and quickly lowered the bottle and turned away from us.  The server walked back over and said that the manager would take the drink off the bill.  I asked her how many other bottles had flies.  \"They wont hurt you they are just fruit flies\"  was her shocking reply.  Apparently these employees haven't been trained on health codes. We immediately cancelled our food. Put $5 on the table for the soda my friend had and walked out.  An employee comes out after us and asks if we were leaving.  We said yes and she told us to never come back.  We told her NO PROBLEM.  Then she said she was going to call the police and make us pay for the fly infested drink and the food we didn't get.  LOL  We waited in the parking lot for 15 min. and no cops ever showed up."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Food is tasty. Never have an issue here and I like the fact that you can get in and out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I use to eat lunch here quite a bit with my students when they came home from university breaks. I remember it being a bit better. 

I was with my daughter, foreign exchange student and adorable granddaughter. She was arguably not as adorable as she could be that evening as she was very hungry.  Our server, a very polite young man, promptly brought her chocolate milk.  As he set down in front of her he mentioned that he would bring two baskets of bottomless fries.  My granddaughter knows that word and what it means. We didn't see him again after that.  We felt as if we were in the frozen tundra and fries would never be coming our way. I took my granddaughter to the front of the restaurant to get a free balloon and walk around the foyer and came back. No fries. Eventually I saw our server and flagged him down. I asked him for crackers, fries, anything. . . 

He was apologetic and kind and brought fries.  They came at the same time as our entrees.  My granddaughter had the grilled cheese sandwich that came with fries.  She picked one up and immediately let fall back to the plate because it was hot.  That seemed acceptable and normal, but when I picked up my fries from my cod burger they were not hot.  I immediately began feeding her my fries.  I didn't get to eat my cod burger until we got home but I really liked it. 

The fries were not as good as I remember them.  There were a lot of thin fries and they just didn't taste very fresh.  That is the only thing I was disappointed in.  The server just seemed overwhelmed."}
{"text":"As the ad says, \"YUM\". I know it is a chain place but you have to love the steak fries and the burgers."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through a delivery service. The hamburger buns were burned badly which ruined the taste of the whole sandwich. The burned taste was the dominant taste. The burger itself was ordered with \"no pink\" but it was over cooked until it was dried out and almost burned, too. The meat tasted like it had been sitting under heat lamps for quite a while."}
{"text":"Red Robin always has solid burgers and today was no different. Pop in with the wife and mum and enjoyed a nice lunch. Mumz had the freckled lemonade which is amazing and we enjoyed some H2O. We started with the mozzarella cheese sticks with ranch and marinara 4/5. For our burgers we chose the jump start double 3/5, the reds tavern double 4/5, always a good choice when you get it ghost pepper style, and the smoke and pepper burger, one of their new items 4/5. all around a good lunch and nicely located at Galleria mall so you can get your shop on after a nice bite for lunch.

Don't forget to join the Red Robin club to get a free burger for your birthday annually!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on Black Friday. Service was just fine and the food came out quick. It was great as usual. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great service and consistent quality. I always get the \"Burnin' love\" turkey burger. It has the right amount of spiciness. Of course the endless fries are a treat when you come really hungry. I tried the \"Poppin' purple lemonade\" for the first time. It was tasty, and the prickly pear flavoring wasn't too sweet."}
{"text":"Being from Seattle and eating in Red Robins there, I know that this is a place for a burger, fries maybe a salad and a nice cold drink. Was happy to see this one open up as I like shopping at the mall and really enjoy a nice lunch after that. 
I have been here 3 or 4 times usually in the early afternoon after the lunch rush and the one thing that has bothered me are the tables are always dirty or sticky. I get walked by at least 5 tables that still are full of dirty dishes and glasses. 
The food is what I expect, a decent burger and fries with a cold drink. Service is also the same basically friendly and that is it. With this being said I still like going here just wish the management would work on cleaning the tables as soon as the guests leave."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while but I was very happy with the Southern Charm Burger with sweet potato fries and a side of campfire sauce. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I came in this establishment this afternoon with my family. We've ate at red robin before and have always enjoyed it but I would not return to this location. 
First, our waitress took awhile to come to our table just to take our drink order. When we officially got our drink order, not all the drinks were brought out and she clearly didn't listen to what we wanted. 
2nd: I ordered the whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap, got it cold and with no BBQ. The salad I ordered was Caesar and I'm honestly not even sure what the heck was on if. 
3rd: I did eat half the wrap bc I was honestly sick of waiting on my food the first time (that was brought out cold) but I explained to her that she brought me out a wrap that had no BBQ IN it. All she said was, 'oh, want me to bring you out a side of BBQ?!' .. Ah no, I wanted it in the actual wrap, that it was suppose to be in. 
And last but not least, when I did tell her about the issue, NOTHING was done about it. She was a terrible waitress and the service was just as terrible. 
We would not return to this location! 

EDIT: 
I would like to say that the manager at this establishment was awesome and why my stars were bumped up. 
I feel sorry if her employees think it's okay to treat customers disrespectful because they don't agree with a review (or feel they should tell me how they thought it was, when that wasn't the case). The manager, joy, was very professional in how she handled the situation when she was on the phone with me. 
I understand that it was very busy, it was a weekend where a lot of people had to evacuate their homes because of the hurricane so I appreciate her taking the time to speak with me (even if it was a couple weeks later bc she was unaware of what had happen)."}
{"text":"Ok. First off, I rarely go out to eat and I had this gift card I've been meaning to use since Christmas and today was the day.  Nothing unusual about the place, had the Schroom burger because I was craving one. We got seated almost immediately, and not more than a minute later our server was at our table taking orders for our drinks. Off he went and was back two minutes later with my iced tea and Sprite for the kid.  We ordered our food and off he went again. Zoomed past our table and was back with new drinks and off he went again. Dude is quick. Y'all need more of Adrian, I'm telling you this guy is quick. Personally, I think the kitchen was holding him up, but that's another visit."}
{"text":"Disappointing....i went to this red robin today for my bday dinner with my son, we ordered chicken strips for him and a burger with Mac n cheese in the burger for me.  The mac n cheese burger came without Mac n cheese on it.
Sent it back, they were fixing it, didn't want my son's food to get cold so I told him to go ahead n eat.
I got my food when he was already done with his. 
Sucks to have a bday dinner when the other person is already done eating.  Then asked for a to go boxe, girl said she forgot, was double charged for my burger so had to wait for that to get fixed... I know mistakes happen n they were nice n tried to fix things but this experience just sucked."}
{"text":"Nicole was our waitress and I'm almost positive that a turtle could have moved faster than her. In fact, we actually had to ask another server to get a side of mayo for us because she never came by to check on us. She didn't even deliver our food to us. She was so bad that we will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"My friend Kevin and I do lunch on Fridays.  That's just how it is.  We both work around the UNLV area so usually we pick somewhere around there, but one Friday found us both at home and so we headed to the mall (yeauck!) and plopped ourselves down at Red Robin to eat in tandem what we'd both talked about in the past: the Whiskey River Chicken Burger.

Now, other places (like my esteemed Otto's) definitely do burgers better, but this chicken sandwich is absolutely dynamite.  A big, thick, juice chicken breast smothered in cheddar, bbq sauce and onion straws.  It's served with bottomless steak fries, but if you get through the sandwich you're not going to have any room.

If you're more of a burger fan, I've tried them before and they're definitely good!  Again, I've had better, but these puppies aren't anything to thumb your nose at if you're in the mood for some red meat.  May I suggest the Banzai Burger with teriyaki and grilled pineapple?  

Boo, it's in a mall.  Boo, it's a chain.  But man, that's one tasty bird on bread."}
{"text":"One of our poorest experiences at RR yet. So many thing went wrong, it's hard to know where to begin. 

Our appetizer and food came out Luke warm at best, my order was wrong, he forgot to take off the free appetizer (coupon), the bathrooms were dirty and without toilet paper... I don't think we would return to this location again."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to agree with a couple of the previous reviews regarding the mediocrity of this place. I've never been thrilled with their burgers, but then again it's been difficult for me to find anything in the US matching the quality of burgers with \"the works\" from Artarmon Seafoods (http://www.eatability.com.au/au/sydney/artarmon_seafoods/). We've been to Red Robin several times, probably for the same reason as lots of other people (we have a kid, they have balloons and kid-friendly food). I haven't had a problem with the place up until our last couple of visits. Time before last, they forgot my kid's meal completely - where we usually say that we'd prefer the kid's food out first with our appetizers if at all possible. Last time, the dude just didn't seem to care - we got our food on time and the usual \"how is everything?\" a couple of minutes later, then absolutely no attention until the bill was dropped on the table, despite our glasses emptying out pretty quick and despite them BEING empty at the time of bill droppage. When he returned to collect the ticket we had to ask for refills in to-go cups. Now, I've never done food service in my life but we all know how it works, right? Take drinks and appetizer, deliver them, take orders, deliver them, and continually scan and visit the table for refills and any additional requests as appropriate whilst smiling and at least giving the appearance of caring. There is also the potential to wring an extra dollar or two out of us for interacting with the 2-year-old and keeping knives and hot plates out of his way when setting them on the table. The guy barely missed a penny tip.

For some reason this place's quality is starting to slide. Considering the lack of food options on the far west side that's a big concern. El Paso is closed, Ritters is closed, the kebab place on Reems closed ages ago, Rio Cafe is mexican crap, Amuse Bouche charges like a wounded bull for pretentious French food (ditto Big Buddha, except their food isn't pretentious per se, just overpriced), Macayo's gave about four people from my work INCLUDING ME food poisoning, that Hawaiian place on corner of Reems and Bell actually had a waiter go M.I.A. while serving our table, Red Robin is turning to shite - lights are winking out in Surprise and I'm not pleased about it. Pei Wei shouldn't have to bear the entire gastronomic burden of the city yeah.

RR gets 3 stars this time because the food remains okay. They get one more change AFAIC, make or break. I'll revise the review next time we go."}
{"text":"My kids always beg to come here for their birthdays. So, against better judgment, we went. We had a group of 8. Service was really slow. The poor waitress looked absolutely afraid when we sat down (im biased but truly my kids were very well behaved, polite, quiet etc). Getting silverware was a chore, getting our drinks and eventually our check took forever. We ordered extra milkshakes for the kids to share. Had to hunt down an otherwise cranky server to beg for a cup to split It up (as we told the waitress when we ordered it) 


I should note - we came during a slow time. Restaurant wasn't crowded at all. 


All in all, I won't be excited to come back. Inevitably my kids will ask and in a moment of weakness I might agree. My salad had rubbery chicken and it was overall a disappointing way to waste $80."}
{"text":"It's a usual Red Robin. It's pretty good and everytime I've been to this location, I've never had a problem with it or the service. I like that you can get any version of the burgers on their menu with a veggie patty or Garden Burger patty instead. 

I always go and say I'll try something new (with the replacement patties, of course), but I usually stick with the one of two favorites. The only other one that I've tried has been a plain ol' Garder Burger with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and pickles. It was good, but being a vegetarian and a bit bored with regular veggie burgers, on my next vist I tried something else (a terryaki pineapple burger) and eventually on another trip the Shroom Burger. And I'm glad I did, they were really good. The only problem, and it's so minor I really don't care, is that the Red Robin in Tucson I used to go to had a mozzarella burger with marinara sauce that this one doesn't have."}
{"text":"Have the Banzai Burger with a fried egg, and the Towering Onion Rings... Our server Sharon totally rocked. For a food chain, I'd say this was outstanding food and service!"}
{"text":"Food was acceptable, service was fine. Waited to be seated which wasn't unexpected but they called us up to be seated where we stood and waited another 10 minutes. Fries came out cold. The seating in there is crammed, everyone is so close together it is uncomfortable. There were many people working there but a fair amount of them seemed to just be wandering around and looking. Our neighboring table got their food and were told sorry no drinks - they're out of clean glasses."}
{"text":"I am only talking about this location. The stapley location is awesome.
We thought we would give this location at superstition springs location one more try, BAD IDEA!!  The food is fine BUT the staff including the blonde female manager leaves a lot of reasons why never to return! We walk in, only people waiting to have some one approach us, instead as usual 3 employees ignored us, finally one actually came back and sat us. The waitress that sat us was not the friendly sort,but hey what did we expect from this location. 2 tables Down from us was a manager amazing enough I think our waitress was expecting a tip
From the manager, because she spent more time with her than us she did take our order but totally ignored us till it was time for the bill. A nice young man severed our food, got a refill , and brought us bbq and ranch sauce. Then we were shall I call it \"entertained\" by the manager and another female server talking crap about other servers. What an entertaining lunch we had NOT!!
As for bottomless drinks, be forewarned you may have to get on your knees and beg for another one. 
Now I am sure you are wondering why we went to this location instead of stapley, with the friendly and attentive servers. Well our movie theater was Right down the street. All I am saying stay away!! Especially is you see the manager with the blonde hair in the pic I posted"}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on with this Red Robin location. We live in Monona so it's the closest and used to be dependably good food and service.

Stopped in before Christmas, snow coming in and they were not busy.  Lots of servers.  Sat down to order and our waitress took our drink order, came back with it and told her we needed a couple more minutes to decide on our order.  She never came back, I could see her behind the bar talking to the other servers, she wasn't busy.  After about a half hour another server who seemed to have quite a few tables stopped by and asked if we were ok, I said no, we didn't seem to have a server.  She took care of our table, seemed to try to talk to the manager about what was going on but he looked pretty disinterested.  After we ordered our food our original server showed up, apologized and told me she had gotten busy behind the bar, honestly, lying is not the best policy, telling me she forgot would have worked better with me.  At the end we tipped the server that actually helped us and did not leave a tip for the no-show server.

Couple of other things, the bottomless fries are now a few fries in a little basket.  Talked to some other locals and one had food served with wrappers from food products in her food.  Other problems were mentioned, this location seems to be struggling.  This could just be the Monona location or maybe Red Robins in general?  We haven't checked out the East Towne location.  This is too bad they typically had good, reliable food, priced pretty well.

I don't leave bad reviews for restaurants that are not great but this was a ridiculous experience considering there was no one in the restaurant.  Be interested to see if I hear anything back from the review, will post if I do."}
{"text":"This is our first (and last) time at this Red Robin location.  My wife, 2 daughters, and I usually go to Willoughby and have an excellent experience.  We assumed that the quality of your service would be universal across all your restaurants.  We assumed incorrectly.

We arrived at approximately 5:50 on 3/20/16.  We were seated immediately as there were 5-10 tables free.  We were placed 2 or 3 booths away from the bathroom against the outside wall, directly across from the main entrance.  Our waitress did not even acknowledge us for at least 10 minutes even though she passed us at least twice that we noticed.  She finally stopped briefly enough to say she would be right back with us.  A few minutes later she appeared again to take our drink order.  Our children decided at the last minute that they wanted a milk shake so we asked for a minute for them to make a decision, but asked for four waters in the meantime.  This was a huge mistake.  At least 10 minutes later our waters arrived by someone I can only assume was a bus-boy or helper.  He placed our waters on the table one-by-one, taking a break in between each to flirt with a girl walking by.  He literately never even looked at us as he placed the waters.  We each said \"thank you\" since I insist my children be polite, but he just ignored us and walked away.  He never even gave us straws.  This is not a big deal for my wife and I, but there were caps on our children's cups.  The were sucking the water through the straw hole.

Finally, our waitress came back to another table and again, stopped just long enough to tell us it would be another minute.  It was now 6:25 and we haven't even placed our order.  We were hungry and tired of being ignored so we got up and left.  It should be noted that we had the \"call server\" button pressed the whole time we were there.

On our way out I spoke with a pregnant woman (I only describe her for identification purposes) manager and told her of our experience.  She only looked and me and said she was sorry.  No attempt at resolution. We had no choice but to leave and find another place to eat.  Someplace that would actually serve us.

We have never felt so ignored and dismissed at a restaurant, especially a national chain."}
{"text":"I know this a chain restaurant.  My husband had an experience at another branch that was less than stellar, but we had just gone to the Cupcakery next door and I was in a mood for burgers served outdoor.  It was over 70 degrees here for the first time this year!  Hooray!  

Our first impression was not stellar.  It took a long time to clear off an outdoor table.  They were empty, but full of old food and dishes.  When we did order it took a long, long time for it to come out (which is why they push their appetizers).  I was nostalgic for Kirk's (see Cupertino and Palo Alto) Pineapple Cheese burger, so I ordered the Banzai burger.  It was very good, but the teriyaki sauce was a little sweet.  Their fries are totally forgettable. My husband ordered the fish and chips.  OUTSTANDING.  Crunchy, hot, moist inside.  I could have eaten them all.  They even had malt vinegar.  I know they are famous for their burgers, but these fish will keep me coming back here a LOT."}
{"text":"The burgers were ok, the buns low quality. Pretzel bites were overcooked & came with a tiny condiment cup of beer cheese dip. We ran out & got a second tiny cup and were charged $1.19 for it. We ran out of These burgers are nowhere near worth $11-16. Will not return again."}
{"text":"Went here recently late (within an hour of closing) and felt like we were inconveniencing the staff by eating here.  The food was slow and dry.  I just feel like I overpaid for not very good food and service.  I think I'll stick to one of the fast food restaurants when I am in this area."}
{"text":"I don't go out to eat a lot when I'm in Arizona. But inexplicably, I've been to this Red Robin twice. 

What I can say is that the service has been good both times. Both times were crowded, busy nights. The first, I was just there for dessert, but the place was slammed. They took care of the dessert and we were set. The shake I had? Well.....the service was good, anyways.

The second time I came in a large group. We were kinda picky, and the server was on top of it, taking care of every request. I got to see lots of dishes delivered, and I still think the winner here is the giant mud pie. Everything else is second place--maybe the fries are a thing because they're AYCE, but they don't touch the pie. The food is sound. Fine. It makes for a good place to take a big group and everyone can order stuff that they recognize."}
{"text":"What on earth happened here? New decor and no service. 30 minutes and no drink order taken. We never even had a server stop by our table. Free burger birthday month be damned. Not worth it. Used to be great to go to."}
{"text":"Beware of this location!!!! I ordered from grub hub and got a nightmare! Items were forgotten, pretzel bites were like wet burnt Little Rock's, burger not cooked well, and all the fries were undercooked. To top it off all the requests that Input on each item such as seasoning, well done etc. were completely ignored!!! I tried to call and got no answer- over 60 times! Their own ordering department cannot reach anyone at the location. I finally called another store after trying again the next day at a very slow time, and I will be contacting their regional manager on Monday. I usually love Red Robin, and with this one so close to our new house i was excited, but it was horrible to the point we could not even eat it, and since they forgot the drink I couldn't even wash the taste out ?"}
{"text":"I have not been to a Red Robin in a wicked long time. We came at the busiest time of the evening and we lucked out and got a table in the bar which had football on and they were easy to see and hear. The burgers came out quickly and were cooked well. They won't do anything other then medium well, which is sad. The service was ok we had to keep asking for drink refills which is a huge pet peeve of mine. My sister had to ask for more French fries and the silverware was just tossed into the middle of the table. Small details guys that matter. Over all a fine experience just service should and could be better."}
{"text":"2 Stars/food, presentation
4 Stars/ Service
Stopped in for a quick bite to eat before taking in a movie. Burgers were 'pathetic' and small in weight/volume. For $11.99 I felt 'cheated'. The Applewood smoked bacon was thin as paper with no flavor. I honestly believe they precisely count the bottomless fries refill. Appears as though '10' steak fries were presented each time. Patio was nice but the fruit trees need to be treated. Flying bugs were awful. Our waitress, Megan' was excellent and overly accommodating."}
{"text":"This is the standard American food and burger restaurant.  I can generally count on this place having good food and service.  Not awesome, but a good experience.  One great burger to try, if you are not concerned with your health, is the Red Robin burger that comes with an egg.  It's really good!

We stopped by for lunch today and got the same friendly service I always get. I ordered the grilled chicken salad over fresh greens with a honey mustard dressing. Everything was fresh and quite flavorful and I would not hesitate to order this again. In fact the portion of salad was so big that I ended up taking half of it with me. Great lunch."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch with my best friend.  We were seated quickly and had a very nice waiter.  We both liked our lunches - her chicken caesar wrap and me bonzai burger.  I like the seasoning salt for the fries and my hamburger was cooked perfectly and tasted really good.  

I would definately go here again with a group.  The menu has something for everyone."}
{"text":"I have to say this was a tough review.  I want to start by saying the service there is top notch.  Great job management, they get a 5 out of 5 on that. Very attentive, professional, and curtious staff.  The wait wasn't bad and I very much enjoyed my drink.  The atmosphere is nice.  We sat in the bar.  A decent amount of TVs and the ambiance was delightful.  It was busy so it seemed a little tight in there, but what can you say?  I mean it's Christmas time, on a Saturday afternoon, and this place is basically attached to a mall!  

So the reason I gave them a 3 was because my food.  I have to preface this by stating I have been to other locations and thought they made a very tasty cheeseburger and I happen to be a cheeseburger connoisseur.  So I was so looking forward to my burger the Burning love.  I ordered it medium rare, it came with fried jalapeño coins, tangy salsa, Pepper-Jack, tomatoes and chipotle aioli on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll. (yes I copied and pasted that off their menu.)  I got the aioli on the side and added L&O.  When it showed up it looked great, even having a whole charred jalapeno speared at the top of the bun, which I did take a bite of drawing very suspicious looks from my husband...

So the burger... It just wasn't there.  I thought the patty itself lacked a lot of flavor.   Really just not that pleasant eating bland meat, so that is definitely no more than a 3 out of 5.  Next the bun.  Ugh it was worse.  I thought I would love it being a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll, but let me say it was heavy, grainy, and the bottom half of the bun was soggy, whether from the grease in the burger or the salsa, I am not certain which one.  The bun is easily a 1 out of 5, I would never get it again.  Not to mention I tasted nothing that would say it was jalapeño infused, and I took the bottom half off and discarded it, eating what I could with just the top part.  

The jalapeño coins made no difference whatsoever, simply just added calories to my sandwich, so a 2 out of four.  I will say I thought the aioli sauce was delightful.  I used it on the burger (spread it on per bite) and dipped my husband's sweet potato fries in it, and they were very good.  The sauce is also a 5 out of 5, but unfortunately I didn't go there to eat aioli sauce.  

Not sure what when wrong but I was disappointed.  My husband on the other hand ate his burger quicker than it took me to take pictures so his experience was positive.  Well judging from the speed it took him to devour his BBQ Whiskey Burger, he must have enjoyed it.  I will also say I like Red Robin's substitution policies.  I subbed out the fries for a salad with light dressing.  you know that makes sense when you are eating a 800 calorie cheeseburger!  The salad was OK, nothing great nothing bad, a solid 4.  

I will go back to Red Robin because I have been to other locations in the past and had a good experience with a very tasty burger.  I will just have to be careful about what I order next time."}
{"text":"Never thought I would differentiate between Red Robins, but there really are differences! I greatly prefer the RR out near Summerlin. This location is a bit difficult to get to with all the mall construction, but if you're looking for it from the inside it's in the middle of the upper level. 

LOVE the bottomless fries! Had the California Chicken sandwich, and should have paid more attention because bacon, mayo, and avocado is really overkill on the same sandwich. Ended up ditching the mayo-soaked bottom bun - we're not counting calories on vacation, but damn!

Decided to grab a couple drinks, and I wouldn't recommend the Long Island - ironically it tasted pretty much like a virgin mocktail, and had about the same effect. The Blue Moon shake is friggin' delicious, though, if you have room for some ice cream. :-) 

Service was alright - I feel like this location is putting a lot of pressure on their staff to upsell drinks and desserts. Can't fault my server for that, so tone it down, management! 

If I'm staying out in Henderson again, I'd return with a more selective eye. The surrounding mall/shopping is great!"}
{"text":"Harrison was our server - he kicked ass. 

RR Gourmet Burger $8.99 w/ GF bun +$1. Bottomless allergen-free fries cooked in a separate fryer. They also ask you how you'd like your burger - med or well-done. 

Beautiful art + decor on the walls and ceiling. Fantastic service. This is a location I would go out of my way for in the future. Thanks for the great GF options!"}
{"text":"Food was great! However we are so disappointed at our server Amy. The restaurant was not busy at all and we were there an hour and she only checked us once and we had to ask somebody to go get her. She asked couple tables behind us how they are doing except us. I saw her on the phone. We wanted more fries and refills but she never come to us. It was maddening. I have to say EVERY SINGLE TIME we come to this location, we always get her and I really don't appreciate the way she serves. Meals are always great but her service is just not right..."}
{"text":"Based on my most recent visit, I am tempted to give 2 stars. But considering the past when I've had above average experiences, I will stick with 3.
My main issue at this particular location, consistency! The burgers are usually on point. But let me elaborate with a few examples. 
1. One day I get a ton of fries, the next visit, I get like 12 fries. Literally, it was a sad little portion. They do bottomless fries, so it's totally not a big deal, again it's about consistency. 
2. Service!!! One day I am blown away by the host, to server, to the management. Most recent visit, total opposite! Our waitress went missing. I literally seen everyone but her. She didn't check up on us, by the time she did, we were ready for boxes. She forgot my side of dipping sauce, as well as my ice water. Just basic, easy, not paying attention mistakes. 
3. The freckled lemonade. I know they have a recipe, no reason for it to be watered down- EVER. 

I like the burgers here, which is why I return. I love the decor, the new look. The family style concept. I just want more of the good from a place that has been there so long. 
The prices are decent, and the food is usually good. It's an easy, convenient, burger joint. They just need to step their game up a bit."}
{"text":"Red Robin is hopping on a Friday night...service was great. Go Matt!  Attentive, friendly, and efficient. Our burgers were delicious and those fries are the best.  I had the DGB ...I heard music with the first bite.  What a wonderful combination of favors.  My son had the Royal burger and the egg was beautiful.  He complained that the bacon tasted like microwave bacon....but managed to eat every bite.  Red Robin....hummmmmm"}
{"text":"Always have great experience her.  The staff is wonderful...the burgers good...end the endless fries...yum.  Only drawback is that is pretty bust consistently.  A drawback only because you might have to wait a bit, but that just means that they're doing it right in there!"}
{"text":"Horrible service from start to finish. Hostesses were too chatty with each other to really help us. Our server didn't crack a smile, AT ALL. It was that \"what do you want kind of attitude.\" The only time she smiled was when she helped us with our check, we left her a small tip. The onion rings were overcooked. The fruit salad that were given to two little girls was a disgusting mess of mashed up fruit that looks like it's been sitting in juice for days, it was disgusting.

Service and food quality was horrible and WE WILL NOT be back. Around the corner is Cold Beers and Cheese Burgers, they have better food at about the same price.

Over and out."}
{"text":"No hostess restaurant overall dirty. Service was ok no silverware at our table. It seem like they were short handed. Food was good tho"}
{"text":"We came in as a group of 4 and chose to sit in the Bar Area. The Bar tender was awesome but once we were seared at a Tall Bar Table the Service / waitress was pretty much non existent for our table of 4! She was more intent on hanging around her \"buddies\"!!. Bartender was on his game though to pick up the slack and make our Happy Hour ( well after happy hour) and dinner more tolerable! Would I want to go back?? If we did, we would sit right at the bar!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar killing time for eye glasses appointment. Friendly staff. Had fried pickles and a beer. Best fried pickles I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place used to have managers walking around asking how things are.  Now they just don't care.  Server did her absolute best to recover for things that weren't her fault.  Root beer floats are worst I ever had.  Flat root beer with no taste and less than a scoop of ice cream per glass.   Probably drive a little further next time.  Updated because they really can't get anything right.  If you customize at all, your order will be wrong."}
{"text":"At the encouragement of the management, we gave Red Robin another try. Much better this time.  It was a busy Sunday afternoon so it took quite a while for our order.  But when it came, the food was hot and tasty.  And our server was really great at keeping u updated on the status of the order.  Overall, wife and I had a good experience.  Glad we gave it another shot."}
{"text":"Went to this location yesterday and I left as I came in........hungry. First impressions say a lot and I was terribly disappointed. This restaurant was filthy like it hadn't been cleaned in a week. Also, the booth seat had a huge rip in it, very uncomfortable to sit in. This location definitely needs a good cleaning and a refresh. The service was fine, it was busy and the server was doing her best. It did take a while to get refills and fries but as I said it was a busy Friday night. Now onto the food; my husband ordered the burger with the egg and my son ordered the kids cheeseburger. Both my husband and son said their burgers were good. Although when they brought my husbands burger out it had mayo on it when he said no mayo so he had to wait for a new one. I ordered the bbq chicken sandwich and maybe it was my fault for ordering chicken at a burger joint but I do not eat red meat. When my food arrived I noticed right away that the chicken looked a little weird. It was pretty thin and kinda looked like a grilled fish fillet. So I took a bit of the chicken and it tasted bad. It had a weird texture, kinda chewy and spongy at the same time. It reminded me of a cheap fast food grilled chicken sandwich. Needless to say I did not eat it and only had some fries for dinner. So if you plan on going here stick to the burgers and don't expect it to be clean and you'll be fine. As for me, I will not be returning. When I go out to dinner I expect to actually eat my food in a clean environment."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Great timing and positive attitudes. Burgers are cooked well and fries are served fresh and hot. Clean and nice area. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I always love Red Robin... Their crispy chicken salad is definitely my favorite, and their burgers will never, ever let you down. This particular location was alright-- large, clean, nice service, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I come here every year on my birthday for a free burger. It's a toss up if your going to get good service but for the most part it's usually good. A few times I have been they take forever to get your drinks and take your order other times it's very quickly. With any restaurant this can happen. I always get the whiskey river burger it's my favorite. Bottomless fries? Yes please! Also love the tower of onion rings and sauces that come with it. 

If your into a big burger sign up for the loyalty card and get a free one on your birthday! 

P.s. The red robin mascot is creepy in my opinion sometimes walks around the restaurant and makes me uneasy. But then again I don't like clowns either.

*UPDATE* Last few visits have had excellent service so upgrading to 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday. Stopped at the Red Robin in Avon. The food was great but the service had a hitch in its giddy up. Our server never came back to ask if we wanted a refill of fries until we were done with our burgers. My wife never received a refill on her lemonade. Very poor service."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends to enjoy some burgers. There were a couple of times when our waitress misplaced/forgot to bring a couple of items to the table, but it was clearly visible that she was busy and for that I sympathize with her. In regards to the quality of the food... I was not too impressed with their burgers. I do not go very often to Red Robin so I didn't have a specific expectation, but I was disappointed at the burger because I know that is what they are known for. 

The four stars goes to the waitress, but the food was about three stars."}
{"text":"We used to visit this location, but the last time was disappointing. Put in an order for pickup two hours in advance, arrived there at chosen pick up time and waited an additional 30 minutes because they were \"overwhelmed with too many Uber Eats orders,\" and food came out cold. Spoke to the manager who said they were too busy and there wasn't much they could do. Disappointing since the food is generally good."}
{"text":"Great location, convenient to retail, the freeway and our neighborhood. 

I have had great luck at this location. They are child-friendly, and have always managed to find a spot for us away from bar (at our request) so the kiddos don't bother anyone.

The selection is great on both the adult and kids menus. The staff is friendly, engaging with the kids and always refilling he drinks."}
{"text":"My first experience was great! The server was very friendly and recommended a great burger. Traveling alone can be scary and it was brought to my attention someone was lurking around my car. The server walked me to my car. It's nice to know there are wonderful people like him out there! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I really want to hate this place.  It is a chain restaurant and not that clean.  However, on Mother's Day when Rigatony's had a 2 hour wait this Red Robin had none.  Add to that the free onion straws just for asking, a delicious salted caramel milkshake and yummy $3 Wedge salad.  I actually love the place!"}
{"text":"We received top notch service from Amanda. They cater to my wife's severe food allergies with out any hassle. Food always tastes great and is always hot. You don't always find service like this in a chain restaurant..."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Excellent waitress. Only complaint the A/C was too cold. It's 45 degrees outside and inside felt like 60 to 65 degrees. Take 2 jackets just in case."}
{"text":"For some reason, my husband and I go there for the past two years on my birthday!  I love their burgers and bottomless fries!  The service in that location both times have been great!  The menus are kind of sticky, but that happens in just about every restaurant you go to!  I will keep going there!"}
{"text":"After a couple other mediocre experiences here, my wife and the 3 kids decided to give this place another go.  We were immediately put off by the fact that every table had a tablet type device intruding on our table.  My wife instantly joked that we were going to need 3 of those things before seriously asking if we could have it removed from our table to which the answer was \"no, sorry.\"  Hmmmm.  We have no choice but to be forced to eat with our family with this tablet thing with marketing messages, games, etc staring at us.  Just nothing I really care about when I go out to eat dinner with my family.  I go out to get away from those things actually.  That alone is enough for me to not go back.  Technology is cool and all, but this is just plain intrusive.  I really felt sorry for the two tops.  The things are pretty significant in size and are just plain awkward if you ask me.  

The two burgers we got weren't bad but certainly didn't justify the price tag.   Specifically asked for a cheeseburger for our 5 year old daughter.  When it came out without cheese, we paged the server with our annoying tablet, and when she came back we explained that the burger was supposed to have cheese.   She apologized and said she would fix it and left the burger with us and headed for the kitchen.  I wrongly assumed that she would be bringing out a new burger with cheese (like we ordered).  However when she returned with a cold slice of cheese on a plate, we were so surprised that we just laughed it off.  At that point, no need to complain to anyone else.  When you factor in the price, it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Two years ago to this exact day, my wife found out she had celiac's disease. I remember it clearly to this day, we had plans to go to Red Robin later that night. 

The news was such a blanket-sweep that no one knew how to feel or act. But to me it felt like she had lost just lost something or someone very close.  

Later on that night, she was completely against the idea of going out to eat because she was so upset. But after some convincing, she finally was decided to stick to our dinner plans. When we were looking at the menu she just started crying.  The once enjoyable experience that she loved going out to eat with friends or family would no longer be the same.

No more ordering what you want, no more relaxing, not worrying if  the food you just ordered might be cross contaminated. It completely ruined the dining experience for my wife and I. Could we ever enjoy going to Red Robin ever again?? This was her favorite restaurant to go to... 

I'm here to tell you that Red Robin STILL is her favorite restaurant.... Why???? Because Red Robin is the only restaurant I know that truly appreciates celiac customers. Not only do they offer gluten-free buns, but they have a dedicated fryer in the kitchen Strickley for celiac customers to prevent cross-contamination. For those of you who don't have celiac's disease or know someone who does, this is huge!!! 
 
My wife gets to keep coming to her favorite restaurant and enjoy the dining experience, not having to worry whether or not the fries she is going to eat are going to make her sick for days... 

So Red Robin, if you are reading this, my wife and I want thank you very much!!! We will be lifelong customers."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, every year I get a free burger on my birthday and it's always delicious. The wait staff are always up beat and helpful. I'm here this afternoon getting my birthday burger. Yum."}
{"text":"This is the best Red Robin here in Vegas. The customer service here is great. The manager Blake cares about his guests and the experience they have. My family and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Do not order the prime rib sandwich.  They picture is NOTHING like what you get.  It is very meager hardly any meat.  When I brought it to the attention of the waitress she said that the meat was weighed....this is why it looks different.  She also refilled my tea with SWEET tea instead of regular tea.  She didn't even apologize - she just said they aren't labeled very clearly!  I don't think we will ever be going back............"}
{"text":"I just didn't get caught up in the hype. After hearing all the hub bub from people over the years about Red Robin, I decided to  throw in the towel and give them a try. Hailed as gourmet hamburgers, I took the bait hook,line and bacon. The place wasn't too crowded my waitress was very kind and attentive. I browsed over the large menu and was quite famished after not eating all day, so everything looked good. I asked the waitress for her recommendation, and ordered something similar. I believe it was the steakhouse burger or something like that. I also ordered pretzel bite appetizer to calm the hunger beast inside my stomach. The pretzel bites weren't anything to yelp home about. So there wen't 5$. The burger finally came, and looked to be pretty above average. Each burger comes with endless steak fries, which are very delicious. The burger was kinda meh.. I was expecting more razzle dazzle based on their reputation. I've experienced better and cheaper burgers at establishments that aren't even famous for their burgers. I would probably give this place another visit on free burger birthday day but otherwise they can keep it."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Red Robin location compared with Mayo Blvd and Talking Stick...because one is dirty and the other one has slow service...
However after attempt to celebrate Mother's Day this last Sunday at this Red Robin at Shea location I have to say I'm not feeling like coming back...
They didn't had enough personal working the orders took years, the service was really slow I understand our server had another tables to take care of too, but she forgot what she was asked and we had to deal by ourselves.
Apparently the manager was \"helping\" that day I supposed because he was not on uniform and was taking care of one table...but when I looked at him couple of times...trying to reach for help because our server was too busy to recall I asked for something...he decided to look somewhere else...
Honestly I didn't feel like celebrating, I already need to take care and improvise at home too...
So disappointed  we just bought a gift card and were planning to use it another time...if we decide to do so it will be somewhere else, not on that location."}
{"text":"Great burgers and the server was outstanding one of the top places to go for a casual lunch will be back and highly recommend"}
{"text":"I was taken aback by the lack of service from the two females working the host stand on 9/17 at about 1pm. We walked in, after about 15 seconds of the staff chatting with each other and completely ignoring us standing in front of them, the hostess very abruptly said \"you can just choose a seat in the bar.\" Wow, no \"hello\", no \"welcome to Red Robin\", no greeting at ALL - and we didn't WANT to sit in the bar. We were there to eat a meal and wanted to sit at a table in the dining room. There was not a wait and many tables were available. Very lazy, dismissive, unwelcoming and quite frankly, really rude - suggest some intensive guest training with the front of the house staff. 

Service at the table (Caleb?) was very good (and welcoming - in contrast to his colleagues manning the podium up front.) Food took quite a while to come out - husband's medium-well requested burger was more like medium-rare. Really like the Tavern Double burger - it's nice to have a more reasonably sized portion."}
{"text":"Came to this location and got seated at about 1pm. At 1:15pm was the first time an employee came to the table.  We placed a drink and food order at the same time.  At about 130pm a couple came and sat at the table next to us.  They ordered and in about 10 minutes received their food.  At around 2pm our waiter came over looking like he forgot about us and said he was going to go hurry the kitchen up.   He brought out cold pretzel bites for my wife and the cheese was gelatinous already.  We ordered fruit salad for my toddler, and this item never came out.  Even after I pointed out he did not get his fruit salad.  

My sandwich and fries come out at about 220pm (over an hour after I ordered it).  It was as advertised and quite tasty. They forgot the sauce I asked for at first order and it was promptly brought out.  


To recap.  
-My food took 1 hour 20 mins to get there from the time we sat down. Was missing sauce I ordered. 

-My son never received his fruit salad but was charged for it (I didn't complain because it was $1.49 and I didn't want to be stuck at the restaurant any longer).  We fed him some snacks from the diaper bag


-my wife just ordered pretzel bites because she wasn't very hungry.  They came out after about 45 mins of waiting and were obviously sitting for quite some time.  

-I did not receive a drink refill or was I asked if I needed a refill (I was empty). 




Food was good, everything else about the experience sucked"}
{"text":"First time visit. Absolutely delighted. I imagined a seating like a diner. To my surprise it was a restaurant type and I was pleased. The onion rings, the pretzel bites and the drinks were delicious. The avocado bacon burger...........mouth watering DELICIOUS. we have so many more things we want to try and we will definitely be back with a bigger group. 5 stars all the way around. Great service. Great food. Great atmosphere. YUMMMMMM!"}
{"text":"We have been to many locations of Red Robin and this has surpassed them all! Our waitress, Ginnes, was by far the best waitress we have ever had. She was very attentive to us, we never had to ask for refills or look for her. Our food was amazing and hot and satisfying. There have been many times when we had a refill of our bottomless fries and they were cold. Today they were hot and fresh! But seriously, we have a big family and everyone has different needs and she was amazing and fulfilling all of them. If we go back it will be because of her, when we go back we hope to have her serving us as well. Thanks for your positive attitude and amazing people skills!"}
{"text":"2nd visit in a month. Was excited to take my husband and 2 kids, as I had went for my 1st time with my sister. We stopped in after a movie and no greeter. We stood and watched as 4/5 servers/hostess talked and watches us. After a 10 minute wait, unsure why it wasn't that packed just a lot of dirty table, we got our drinks.........they mixed those all up. We ordered our food. I asked for the guacamole bacon burger, well done. I got a medium done burger with very cold and hard fries. I was finally able to flag our waitress down and asked for well done. The manager then came and apologized for the error. 15 minutes later, just as my family was half way done I get my burger and very fresh fries. We asked for refills of soda and ice water from the waitress that stopped by to see if my burger was to my liking. Waited 10 minutes. No drinks. No waitress in sight. The manager returns and we ask for refills. And a refill of some sweet potato fries we ordered. Drinks come and we wait for our fries. We finish up and ask for our check. Pleased to see the raw burger was removed from our check. We pay and still never got our fries. For $67 that was the absolute worst service and food and I was extremely disappointed. Will more than likely not return. That's to bad, I enjoyed my 1st visit but for that kind of money I'd rather go somewhere else where I know the service is guaranteed exceptional."}
{"text":"Called in an order for our business and I forgot to add something for our doctor so I called back and was put on hold for 23 minutes! I hung up and called back 3 times and was put on hold every single time. I will not be ordering from this location ever again!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I ate ate this location quite a while ago, and the main thing I remember was blah food and slow service. Sitting in the restaurant right now with slow service and an overcooked burger in front of me. The adult shakes and the poutine fries are quite good though."}
{"text":"New waiter should have help right?  Not here. Waited 1.5 hours for food. No forks spoons or napkins.  They looked bewildered when I asked. Manager failure."}
{"text":"Good stuff. I've loved Red Robin since I was a teenage and they just keep getting better. Such a huge variety of burgers to pick from now. Also the unlimited fries were served as an appetizer the 5 minutes we were waiting for burgers to come.  They were very quick!  Great staff and great service. This was my first time trying the pig out burger and it was very tasty!"}
{"text":"I was killing time while my Toyota car was being serviced at the nearby Sansone's Independent Automotive - Henderson, NV dealership so I was able to shop around the malls and eat a sitdown meal. I chose to eat at Red Robin because I had eaten Mexican food the day before (the other option I saw for sitdown service was a Mexican restaurant across the way). 

I don't know why others on here gave bad service reviews because my service was fast and the waiter was very friendly; and this was new years eve when the entire Galleria mall in Henderson was busy with shoppers.

I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger with a side of ranch dressing and found it very delicious. I honestly ordered this because I liked the ingredients and I pulled up my yelp app to find a decent review of what to grab at the restaurant. I was thoroughly satisfied with my visit here."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this particular location. Previous visit was in Centennial. We enjoyed the food there very much.
The Summmerlin location is closer for us so we we decided to go there.
 Service was okay. We were greeted quickly and our server was very friendly.
The burger was very bland. The aioloi was very good but the meat itself was very flavorless. The fries were cold and old....pre-cooked and left under a heating lamp it seems.

It's okay for the money but I'd rather a Fatburger or In N Out for the quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here today on a whim. It was about 2:30 in the afternoon and  we walked into a short line at the hostess station. We peered around and it was not busy at all. I thought that the hostess was possibly seating another family, however after standing third in line, I realized that was not the case.   The lady in front of us finally gave up and sat at the bar. The family in front of the line finally was assisted and sat.  The host finally came back. We at this point had been standing there not greeted for about 5 mins at restaurant that was not busy. The host came back and never apologized or said hello. He just looked at us and said \"two\"?, then happened to take their seating chart and walk over to a group of woman and talked about for a minute or so as to what table they were going to sit us at! I was now annoyed.  Finally he brought us to a bar table and sat us down. We should have just sat at the bar in the first place and probably would have had drinks and are order in!  

The server thankfully came over and took our order in a timely manner. He was pretty good. He forgot to bring our fries out early as he said he would. I had the chicken teriyaki sandwich and my husband had the beef burger version of it. It was good and no complaints on the food. 

I was debating back and forth about giving more stars, however I saw many people who worked there walk by all the people waiting to be seated and ignored us or were hanging out talking by the kitchen and not even trying to jump in and help.  From a customer service stand point, unacceptable."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I'll be back. My husband and I ordered 2 burgers and 2 sodas. My food arrived cold, we kept having to ask for drink refills, and when the check came it was $66?!? Luckily, my husband reviewed the bill before simply paying it. We were charged for extra drinks and burgers we never ordered. The bill ended being half the amount after we questioned it. Our server was hard to track down when my food arrived with mistakes. I asked to add mayo to my burger and had to wait for my already cold food to be taken back and fixed. The food was good (after it was fixed), but the service was questionable. Maybe next time I'll just do take out instead."}
{"text":"First time here, tried some burger with teriyaki sauce and grilled pineapple. I also added fried onion strings, because those are my favorite. That being said, it was overkill, literally so many onion strings, the pile was thicker than the meat. Burger patty was a little dry, but it was edible and I asked for more sauce and it seemed to fix the problem.
Service was just okay. We say please, and thank you to the server and he just ignores us and walks away. Granted, he was very busy but still, a smile goes a long way.
Utensils and cups were a little dirty, the dessert menu was absolutely disgusting. It was sticky and food items stuck to it. 
Will probably return, but hope for a little more next time."}
{"text":"So glad they still have the Whiskey River bbq chicken burger. Ben my fave for years now. This particular location did a great job the night my family and i visited. Great service. Seemed a bit spendy. What's up with the process lately."}
{"text":"Burgers were juicy and the ghost pepper sauce made my eyes water.  Sweet potato fries were bottomless and the Red Robin lager quenched my thirst."}
{"text":"First time at this location and our server Paul provided excellent customer service and was very knowable about the food. After lunch my brother could not find his truck keys and the Manager, Hostess, and a couple of the servers went out of their way to help us look for the keys. Never seen anything like this before World class customer service that was so appreciated by my family. Thank you Red Robin Manager and staff."}
{"text":"We love Trevor! We have had him as our host twice here. Just with that guy alone, my husband and I will come back repeatedly, and have. Very pleasant young man. So happy to be here and we love that. Go you Trevor. Can't wait to see you soon."}
{"text":"Terrible service 
We sat at the bar which was filthy
Took forever to be greeted even though we hit the little light thing for service
Ordered 2 beers and onion rings to start no issue with those
Then ordered burgers which must have been shrunk in the microwave as the pattys were shrunken which is not how i remember the burgers being. 
I ordered the bacon cheeseburger where the bacon was raw. I asked for a side of ranch with my meal and no seasoning on the fries. Neither were right. We waited forever to get our check. Overall it was AWFUL. Won't be returning. Used to be a fave with the kids guess not so good for just me a hubby"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly, and quick to get your order in and food to you. All the servers have been very helpful even to tables they weren't assigned to. I've been to this Location a handful of times now and will continue to go back. Great food, great services."}
{"text":"Ate here today with the family.  We were sat promptly and had to wait a little for a server.  The manager noticed this quickly and got on it and resolved the issue before we had to ask.  Our server Steph was great and attended to us with professionalism.  We have not been to this Red Robin in years and plan to continue to come back when in the neighbor hood.  Overall impressed.  Had the BLTA croissant for the first time.  Could use a little more avocado but I enjoyed it.  I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My family has been to this Red Robin dozens of times. The last two were the best. This was due in part to our server Jayme. Although we have almost always had great service at this restaurant she has by far been the best. We can tell as a customer that Jayme very much enjoys her job and gives the best customer service a person could expect. The food is always on point and the entire staff goes out of their way to do a good job. Looking forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"My kids and I decided to come and eat lunch here after church, my hamburger was not cooked all the was and was light gray and pink. I had asked for it to be cooked very very well done.
 I waited for 20 min before they brought out the new one and when I cut it in half,this time it was red and light pink.... 
I sent it back and let them know I lost my appetite.  I had ordered a cheese burger for my daughter  and the server just keep on telling me it would be out in a few minutes.... we waited for 10 extra minutes after the other kids had finished their food and the people at the table next to us had also received a red raw burger...we finally left. 
Although the server was very apologetic... the managerer that came over was annoyed that I was being so fussy.  They gave me 50% off our bill and $20 toward our next visit. I really don't think I will be back again."}
{"text":"I will say that this is definitely a better location than the one in Summerlin (in my opinion). I came back here a couple of weeks ago with family, and we had a good experience. I would've given this location 4 stars if the wait wasn't so long. The staff was friendly and attentive, and our orders came out quickly. The freckled lemonade doesn't disappoint (unless it's watered-down). The food is just okay... nothing special."}
{"text":"I hate this location!!!!

My order is NEVER ready when I show up. Most times it is wrong and they have to redo it. Every time I order, I ask for extra fries...NEVER get them.

It's too bad, i love their burgers but, I cannot go back."}
{"text":"I am not a burger fan - however it's been awhile since I've dined here. They have extended their menu including a delicious chicken teriyaki sandwich. The fried zucchini was awesome - beer battered and thick zucchini. My family members ordered burgers which they all loved, my mom loving the sweet potato fries and sis, loving the garlic fries - both bottomless. Another plus - the meals are served on plates - not a basket. Give it another try if you haven't."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience at this location. Server was very rude towards me about my bill, which they had to correct a few times. Assuming my 11yr old daughter was older then what she was. Arguing with me about the price of sides ,which comes free with kids meal . I ordered 2 kids meal for my 9 & 11yr old daughters. I had to talk to the manager about our server."}
{"text":"Was in the area looking for something to eat.  We decided to visit Red Robin at Downtown Summerlin.  It wasn't too crowded for a Saturday around the time we went.  I was sooooo excited when I saw that they had bottomless root beer floats!!! OMG!!! ROOT BEER FLOATS!!!!! It was so delicious!  Our server was Red I believe that's what she said.  If not I'm so sorry!!! Hard of hearing! But she suggested I try the firehouse dipping sauce which was bbq sauce and mayo.  Omg!!! I wanted to put this sauce all over everything!  It was so amazing!  A creamy bbq flavor jus the right mixture of sweet and creamy.  Heaven in my mouth, YUM!  I got the country style burger it had bacon and bbq sauce with some cheese.  Amaze balls! And you gotta love the bottomless fries!  Our visit was great!  Our sever was on it.  And my root beer float,  ohhh so amazingly delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service left much to be desired. We waited much longer than we were told to be seated. We were taken to our table and had to wait while the server cleaned off our table. Once we ordered, we waited a long time to receive our food despite the fact that the restaurant was not full. The server spilled my milkshake and did not offer me a new one and also got my friend's chicken salad order wrong. In addition, the restroom was filthy and the trash was overflowing. This was a pretty disappointing experience as Red Robin is usually clean and efficient."}
{"text":"Red Robin was totally off tonight. Enrique was overwhelmed and when he came to check on us for refills etc he was walking away as he asked the questions. My husband and I ordered Cadillac margaritas-- we told the waiter three times they were Cadillac and he still brought house margaritas. My eldest granddaughter's cheeseburger was very pink inside and they offered to make a new one which was a plus however they TOTALLY forgot about my burger. By the time I got it, they burger was cold and so were the fries. Very disappointed in the quality of food tonight. To add insult to injury, we ordered the onion rings which are our absolute favorites and they were so soggy the coating was coming off. I had to eat them with a fork. Two thumbs down"}
{"text":"Wow. #RedRobinEpicFail Just stopped in for a quiet Sunday evening beverage and fries. Location was out of fries and the beer tap was broke.
Location blacklisted! Will not be around much longer. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"I find it difficult to give 4 stars let alone 5. 

Red Robin honestly does burgers to perfection.  The service is always with a smile and the atmosphere both inviting and comfortable. 

The food ; I usually get the royal.  This is a 1/2 lb never with an egg,  bacon,  lettuce and tomato.  Finished with mayo and a pickle.  The burger is cooked to perfection consistently and is full of flavor workout being gressy. 

If you purchase 5 entries in 5 weeks you get 20. 00 of your next meal.  If you usually go with someone then after the troops you have 20.00 meal credit coming and your one meal into your next credit ; awesome."}
{"text":"A simple burger and fries should not  be a problem but this one had me on the throne all night. I have eaten at this location before with no issues. Not sure what went wrong but most definitely will not be returning. The next hamburger I eat will be from home . Red Robin lost this customer for $7.56."}
{"text":"Great burgers at red robin! Staff are always nice and the selection of their burgers are awesome! Very reasonably priced and you can't beat the unlimited steak fries! I would be definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Red Robin is our go to in California so we decided to go in Arizona when visiting.  Front desk girl was really nice seated us in a booth and talked nicely.  Ordered onion rings order came wrong brought us more out had to ask for my salad and because of this I think they held my food because our burgers were cold, fries limp and daughters meal was cold. Very disappointed!  Server was nice but pretty shaken up had to ask for refills. At end of meal saw a $1.99 charge on my bill apparently it's for the games that were on the kiosk at end of table I questioned the charge and the waitress told me she usually asks but saw my kids holding it and thought they wanted the games on thanks for asking."}
{"text":"Wait staff were great but the facility is extremely dirty.  Condiments on table thick with grease had not been wiped down in a very long time as well as the menus, very sticky.  Had to wash hands twice during my meal and when I went to the bathroom they were not the cleanest as well.  Food was fine but not great I would eat at a Red Robin in the future but not at this one."}
{"text":"If you have any other option in Downtown Summerlin I would suggest going there. Our party of 8 had a terrible interaction with their late night hostess on Wednesday evening. Her attitude turned nasty when we told her the number of people in our party. She practically refused to serve us. She questioned the mere fact of being able to serve us on a quiet Wednesday night. She started literally slamming the cutlery together. Finally our party decided not to dine here because it wasn't worth ruining our evening and getting unenthusiastic dinner service. Please dine somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Red Robin at both here in Las Vegas and in Southern California since the mid 1990's. Over the years, little had changed. It was a family driven atmosphere with balloons, kitschy wall adornments, and a large fiberglass bird mascot in the dining room. Kids were welcomed with crayons and a small arcade. The kids menu was colorful and the menu was largely fried and burger based, and it was great. 

Unfortunately, times have changed and Red  Robin is going through a \"modernization\" of sorts. Gone are all the movie posters and even the fiberglass bird mascot. Now it is trying to be hip, cool, sleek and modern. Even the balloons and crayons are gone. It is trying to be a higher end gourmet burger place that seem to be the trend in the USA. I am not happy about the change and miss the way it used to be. 

On my last visit to the Red Robin in Centennial Center, the decor was modern boring. The kids menus were photocopied in black and white, and crayons were not offered. Service was not as quick as it used to be, though the food quality was the same as I remember. 

Overall, I miss the old Red Robin. That pretty much sums it up."}
{"text":"Just fine, but strange.  We were seated in the bar on the high chairs.  And electronic menu/ordering tablet was there on the table and the hustle and bustle was a loud.  Our savior was waitress Alicia, Ba who did the interpretation for us.

The menu had all variety of burger.  Toppings abounded and you could order just about anything if one of the many suggested burgers were not to your total liking.  We did the Nacho Crunch Tavern burger and the chophouse burger.

You have a large or regular burger option.  The large is half pound and the regular is quarter pound.  They were served in a basket.

The fries were not great. Way too salty and, frankly, nothing special.  You could get all-you-could-eat/endless fries, by the way.  But the burgers WERE very good.  Juicy and tasty to the point that we took turns after eating to go wash our hands.  Don't wear white or ecru or everyone will know what you ate.

Service seemed to be set up for the machines but we had Alicia taking care of us and she did a good job."}
{"text":"To sum up this Red Robin, it's just \"meh\". The staff was very friendly and attentive, but the food was just mediocre. The only thing that was outstanding was the Oreo shake. My burger was nothing special, and neither were the fries. The freckled lemonade has also gone downhill, which sucks because I love strawberry lemonade. My boyfriend's side of fruit was just liquidy mushed up fruit. The restaurant also wasn't the cleanest environment. There are definitely better dining options."}
{"text":"We've gone to Red Robin before and the food and service has been really good. 

This time however, the good was not good and the service sucked. 

We waited over 45 minutes to get our food. My husband got the A1 burger and it was burnt. I got the chicken wrap with the chicken tortilla soup. 
The soup was nuke warm and the wrap was ok at best. 
We ordered  beers and they tasted like they were coming from the bottom of the keg. 

We ordered more of the \"bottomless\" fries and didn't even get them until after we paid the bill."}
{"text":"The food was decent and the drinks were delicious.  However, I wonder if there is some special training that waiters and waitresses go through in Arizona to constantly tell you that \"you must really be feeling that one by now!\" when you have had a few sips of a drink.  Being told that I'm drunk when I haven't had a more than half of a cocktail is off-putting and I've experienced it at enough Red Robin's to wonder."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple times and both times had awful service. Waited a long time after being seated before being waited on. Never got the bottomless fries. Had to go to the kitchen and ask for silverware. Waitress/waiter only came over once. This place is horribly disorganized and service bad."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday afternoon and the dining room was 1/2 full and it was a 20 minute wait.   Anyway we waited..at the bar then was seated.  Server was very friendly... but the food at this location to me seems to always be unsatisfactory.  It's never cooked the way I ask.  So for me I will be going to Avon."}
{"text":"Food was good (as always) but I didn't care for the staff. The hostess (dark black hair, think her name was Deb?) very friendly, but other than that no one else was that great. My waitress asked if I wanted lemon in my water, I said no, but surprise, they put one anyways. Ordered and appetizer and a burger and they both came out at the same time (not usually how people like it). Again food was the same as the others (good) but staff is not as good - that's why this location gets 3 stars."}
{"text":"Let's sing it all together... Red... Robin...... BUMmmmmm. 
After a long day of sporting events, we wanted to grab something good and quick. 
Second time we have been here since the remodel, and AGAIN the menu has changed. The biggest change was the raise in prices. A $10 to $15 Hamburger is not a family friendly price. But I will admit my burger was tasty, but to call them gourmet because they have different con sauces and toppings is an understatement to charge so much. 
Instead of fries I chose to substitute with a cup of French Onion soup which cost extra, that's fine, Surprise, they have new dishes, that include a small square shaped bowl that probably holds 3 ounces, but by the time they put in the bread, I may have had 2 Tsp. of broth, 
My one daughter ordered a burger which she ate 1/2, saying it didn't have much flavor. The other daughter a pizza and my husband a soup and salad. No complaints. 
Our server was very busy with large groups of tables but was still very attentive to us. 
Here's the topper, they have an electronic pad on all the tables. It advertises specials, let's you pay your bill, or you can play games. My one daughter looked at it briefly to see what all the pad did. When we got the bill, there was a charge for an entertainment fee. When I questioned it our server said it was from playing the games. I thought for a moment because no one played a game. But my daughter did hit the click on the button here for games when she was looking at it. When I looked at the pad, I waited for the game screen to pop up, when it did in white lettering along a blue sky with white clouds reads that you will be charged. Our waiter was kind and removed the charge, which we appreciated."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place to come to get burgers. The past 5 visits that my husband have come to eat it's been getting progressively worse. I'd say that it's pretty bad when you used the know almost everyone there and no there are no one but new faces. Plus the burgers are going downhill. Jason used to be our favorite waiter. We ALWAYS requested him. Just found out that he's no longer there. We had kept asking for him when we came in they would tell us he was off. He was great! Always had excellent service with him. You never had to ask for anything. The second time we had him he remembered us and our order and was such an awesome waiter! Our previous visit had been with Jessica and it was terrible. She was the worst waitress ever service-wise and had an attitude when we questioned a charge that was on our bill that we never get charged for. My husband and I order the same thing every time we go there. Food is not great and neither is service anymore. No reason to go back! Going to have to find another burger joint."}
{"text":"First time in a very long time since I have visited.  The waitress Rita was extremely friendly and attentive.  The 5 star rating is for her.  I think the restaurant was busier than they expected to be.  All the employees were very nice."}
{"text":"I don't think they should let little ass kids work here, they don't know jack shit about being a waiter, and they run off once you have are asking for something, not very attentive poor communication skills, overall bad experience, I've been going to this location and the waiters here is like a needle in a haystack some days will be incredible and some days are just out right terrible, I think this problem can be solve by eliminating these non experienced waiters & waitresses."}
{"text":"Me: Where do you want to eat for dinner tonight?
4 year old: McDonald's!?
Me: Nope. Where else do you want to eat?
4 year old: Red Robin!!
Me: Alright

Per the kids' request, we visit Red Robin every one to two months. They like it because of the miniature arcade in the front, balloons, crayons, and kid's menu/coloring page/activities. I like it because it is always super loud so no one can hear when my 1 year old gets fussy or when my 4 year old isn't using his inside voice. All of the craziness at my table blends in with the ruckus of the remaining restaurant into one big, happy, burger-eating union.

I'm sure you know that they give you unlimited steak fries, but did you know that for $0.99 extra, they will turn those into Garlic Parmesan fries? I'm quite certain they use garlic out of a pre-minced jar and pre-shredded parmesan, but they are still delicious. Make sure to ask for their ranch, which is scrumptious, and the perfect pairing for their fries. 

My husband and I usually share the guacamole bacon burger which is a decent burger. I honestly can't say it's much better than the one from Carl's Jr. but we're paying for the atmosphere and bottomless fries. Our bill usually comes to around $20 for an appetizer, burger, and kid's meal. For a family of 4, I think this is a bargain. Red Robin wouldn't be my first choice to fulfill my burger craving, but it does a decent job and my family loves it so we will continue to frequent this place."}
{"text":"After a long flight with so many stops on the way, this was like heaven.  I met 2 friends there cause they were on their way home the day we came in.  The four of us had some apps: spinach artichoke dip, the most awesome fries with dipping sauces and seasoning, and chips(or pita...can't remember).  For lunch, my friend and I both had the chicken wrap with bacon and avo added and chicken tortilla soup, my bf had the burger with blue cheese and we added bacon to it, and my other friend had the bbq wrap with another soup.  We polished everything off in no time.  BTW, I have never been here before and didn't know i could get a drink and get free refills.  Steak fries too.  I will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now. Always delicious. This time I got the a1 peppercorn burger, my man got some ghost pepper one, one tall blue moon, a Coke, we got bbq wings, and onion rings as well. Everything was super good. Jackie was extremely friendly!!! When I come back I'll definitely ask for her again. (: I asked for my burger to be medium but got well done. I noticed it was a little dry (still good and nothing sauce can't fix) so I simply just told the waitress. I wasn't mad at all either. She apologized and asked if I wanted a new one but I denied. She sent the manager Kristen or Kristy over and she apologized and asked if I wanted a new one. Again, I kindly denied and we chatted for a bit. When we were about to pay, the manager came up to our system and comped off my burger entirely. I was expecting the beer or drink to be comped but an entire burger? That's going above and beyond. She didn't have to, so it left us surprised. I left extremely happy and thankful! I'll be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Came out on a Saturday night since other restaurants im the area had a long wait.

Service - It wasn't great as the server kept forgetting to bring extra fries, check on water, not bring added items etc. Our server was forgetful and didn't check up enough.

Food - Good burgers just like any other Red Robin.

Prices - Not bad for what you get as some other places will bump up pricing cause of a established business. 

Venue - Busy and fun venue as everyone is having conversations enjoying dinner.

Wont be back to this location but they need to screen servers better and make sure they get on top of clients orders."}
{"text":"Went to Red Robin i Robinson on a Saturday after a movie. 5 waiters!waitresses walked by our table but no one waited on us or even said that they would be with us. A table of 6 sat down across from us and was waited on immediately. We left and went the the Central Diner. We were acknowledged immediately and given water. We had our food in under 10 minutes.  We had excellent fast service and excellent food.  See my money is good at other places Red Robin."}
{"text":"We love this place! We come at least once a month.  You can never go wrong with \"bottomless fries\"  as an appetizer and distractor for the kids.  The burger selection is good and service is always prompt and friendly.  I recommend signing up for there frequent diner card to earn free burgers for purchases and a birthday burger as well."}
{"text":"I decided to order some take out for the family and what better place to order than Red Robin. The burgers are always great but the service is horrible. Once I got my food to go I ensured everything was in the bags, and they were. Headed home and began eating when I noticed why this location gets low ratings. I ordered sides of fries and coleslaw and got an order which portion was better off not being ordered. There were about 2 spoonfulls in each container. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Red Robin location.  The wait is never too long, the food is great and the service is always excellent."}
{"text":"There was a 20 minute wait tonight, when we were sat they put us at a table that is hard to get comfortable due to the placement (its pretty much in the way of everyone trying to get by). A waitress asked my boyfriend to scoot in when really the lady behind him needed to, she was sticking out with her butt on the edge of the chair & my boyfriends chest was touching the table! When we asked to get moved they did it with no problem! The managers are really sweet, and our waiter is nice but seems really stressed due to the fact that they keep bombarding him with too many tables compared to the other waiters. They gave him a table of about 14 people and 5 other tables. Food was awesome! Yummy burgers and freckled lemonade. Just 3 stars due to inconvience of seating and lack of attention for service."}
{"text":"Mediocre-at-best  somewhat over-priced food and more kids than a McDonald's PlayPlace or Monkey Joe's.  Place is clean and the service is decent.  But if you don't want to be around a lot of kids when you eat, you'll have to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Burger was supposed to have guacamole on it (had a pathetic excuse for a smear). Kids fruit cup shows a picture of a white bowl with fruit. You actually get a small condiment cup with disgusting thawed frozen fruit that does not look edible. We let the server know and she said \"that's because it's frozen, I usually don't recommend the fruit\". Well, why did you not tell us when we ordered it?  Server also never checked In on us. Bottomless fries is pointless if you can't get a servers attention to get more. Place has gone down hill from our last experience."}
{"text":"This place is very good and consistent from location to location.  I am addicted to their seasoned fries and their strawberry lemonade.  This location could use a little sprucing up, but otherwise great."}
{"text":"Typical Red Robin.  Good service, never much of a wait here on the weekend."}
{"text":"First time I've ever been disappointed in a visit to Red Robin. Our server, Elizabeth, was awful....she was in a huge hurry, was visibly annoyed by a question or request. Asking for crispy fries was an issue, received them barely cooked and she was irritated when they were sent back. We waited almost 40 minutes for a check because she assumed we were using the machine on the table...patty melt was well done when asked for pink and bread was soggy...not a great experience and as much as I like Red Robin, there are way too many other burger places around to be treated as an imposition by your server....if we don't return, it will be due to Elizabeth."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you are on your own and want a comfy place to have a drink and meal. They will only seat singles at uncomfortable high tops in the bar, not what I hoped for after a long day of cleaning out my aunt's house for sale. Not living in Ohio I took my chances on a chain and was sorry. I ended up having them pack up my meal so I could go sit in an almost empty house and eat without worrying about a rocky high top seat. And the food was pretty blah too. Decent martini though."}
{"text":"Yesterday, after having gone through a laser back procedure, my husband and I stopped by the Red Robin's Gourmet Burgers restaurant near our home to get lunch to go.  When we got home, we were ready to eat.  The Onion Rings we'd ordered were good and my husband's Black & Blue burger was good.  I had order the Pig Out Burger as I really like burgers with bacon.  When ordering, I requested that the sauces be to the side (little cup type containers) and no cheese.  The burger I received had nothing but the hamburger patty - NO bacon, tomatoes, lettuce or anything else! (3/4 of my burger is sitting in the frig.)  We had never been to any Red Robin Restaurant before but had purchased a gift card in Dec. for a Christmas Gift to send to my eldest brother.  I sure hope that he is able to find a more reliable establishment in Alabama than this one."}
{"text":"Love the service here!!! & their food is awesome too I ordered the charm burger (not the full name of it lol) it has bbq sauce lettuce bacon & onions on it also love how clean this place it"}
{"text":"Love their attention to a gluten free menu and the gluten free bottomless fries are awesome."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Red Robin in 20 years.  Decided to give this a try last night as they have recently opened near my home.  The food was on point, the burger patty had lots of flavor and was cooked perfectly with just a bit of pink inside.  I ordered the $6.99 special burger--it was a lot of food (with bottomless fries) for the money.  It is a rare find these days to go to a sit down restaurant and eat a big meal and be out the door for less than 10 bucks, but you can at Red Robin.  I also got the fried pickles with campfire sauce.  I personally liked the sauce, but my gf asked for ranch instead.  The fried pickles were delicious without any sauce, which again is pretty rare.  Overall, great food.

The service was decent.  I wasn't blown away, and it was a bit slowish considering how sparse the restaurant was at 9 at night.  But, it wasn't at all bad, and frankly if they had brought me even more glasses of the bottomless lemonade I'd just be fat.  So maybe I'll look at it as a positive.  

I will be back!"}
{"text":"i am a red robin fan for the same order everytime i go. i've only tried their freckled lemonade and whisky river bbq chicken wrap! yes i really mean it when i order the SAME thing everyyyy time. i love it that much. i can't even explain why i love this order. its yummy and it'seven absolutely better with the best honey mustard on the planet! please try their honey mustard, and agree it's the best out there! ok so my routine, is i eat half the wrap save the other half for left overs and when we're ready to go ask for fries AND freckled lemonade to goooo! mmmm bottomless! =)"}
{"text":"We came out to try the new location!  I ordered the wedgie burger!  Great flavor! We got the tower of onion rings!  Cooked just right!  Had a server named Samantha. Very friendly!  Husband got the sweet southern charm!  Bacon was sweet and fantastic! Daughter got the corn dogs and broccoli, she must have liked it cause it was gone. Lol. We got buzzard sauce for fries only to discover it was made incorrectly.  Manager checked on us and corrected it and explained the issue.  Very apologetic and took care of us to an extreme.  Brought us new sauce and it was good.  Service was a little slow at first but that is to be expected on the first opening week!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Had a cool waiter. Courtney was at the top of his game. Food was delicious, friendly service, dope memorabilia on the walls and the restaurant was clean. I had the bacon cheeseburger and sweet tea. Delicious, fresh and priced right. Will go back for sure"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch this weekend. Best service of any Red Robin I have been to in a longgggg time. Food was also great!"}
{"text":"We ate at the ET RR last week and both got sick. I contacted RR by email leaving info and no response.
Got a survey later in the week and left details, no response.
We shared a burger, both had fries, my mother had a small strawberry shake and I had half a crab cake burger, a few fries, root beer float (mostly root beer) and a little water with lemon.
The $14 crab burger was overpriced, a bit rich and came with oily toppings. There was something like a pimento which overwhelmed. Crisp crab cake, lettuce, simple or choice of topping, lemon, was what I was looking for.
My mother didn't care for the simple burger which I thought was okay, but not $9 bucks of okay. She wasn't impressed w/the shake which didn't measure up to A&W or Micky D's in her book.
The fries were luke warm and lifeless so neither of us ate many. If we had been offered refills as advertised, maybe those fries would have been better. Or more appropriately, \"Are your fries okay?\" cuz they were pretty much uneaten.
No refill on the bottomless float either--a sloppy pour with a dollop of ice cream and mostly foam. There wasn't even 1/2 a glass there and I did get more root beer, but no more float. The tablespoon of ice cream was tasty.
The waiter was surly, seemed resentful he had to wait tables and looked like walking road rage. 
The table was dirty, the restaurant was full of yelling kids which I don't care about, but some might. 
The kids menu has Mac n Cheese, a burger, grilled cheese bites, pasta, pizza, little corn dogs and more from about $4-$5.00.
Interesting that the table kiosk automatically started the tip at 20%.
Also interesting that the place was so busy on an early Sunday night with school the next day.
None of the desserts tempted us."}
{"text":"Amazing deal on Tuesdays. Just say Tavern Tuesday to get buy one get one free Tavern Double Burgers! The deal requires you buy two drinks but I bet you can't get a better deal at any other burger joint on Tuesday. The kids meals are always a hit and try the freckled Lemonade for a special treat."}
{"text":"I simply love burgers and love trying every burger that anyone has to offer.  Something new that I found here that nowhere else had was the Bleu Cheese burger.  The burger was good, not great.  The meat was salty, partly due to the bleu cheese, but that comes with the territory.  I don't blame them for trying.  Also, pay attention to the bread that your burger will be served on, as I got a jalapeno loaf, that was okay but dry compared to my girlfriend's normal sesame seed bun.  

They have bottomless steak-cut fries, which I don't think too many people take up the bottomless offer.  Just think about large, unseasoned potato wedges.  But they do have their own seasoning on all the tables.

The staff are very friendly and service is excellent.  They refill your drinks with brand new ones when they see yours get down to half or less, at least our waiter did.  Also, very fun for birthdays as they sing and encourage the other patrons to join in."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews. We had an excellent experience! Greeted by 4-5 employees immediately when we entered. Friendly service throughout our visit. Food was great! My 8 year old son commented on how clean the bathrooms were, so I thought I'd include that as well! ;-)"}
{"text":"Oh red robin. I just try so hard to like you but I just find you oh so boring. 

Story- when my boyfriend and I started dating , red robin was his FAVORITE place to go. If I wanted to treat him, he wanted to come here. I tried tons of items on their menu and just never loved anything. Eventually, he broke away from his red robin obsession and moved onto chilli's (another place I just do not like, lol). 

Him and I haven't been to a red robin in over a year- until yesterday. I was so hungry I didn't care where we went, so when he suggested red robin I figured why not? Although my memories of red robin consisted of bland chicken sandwiches and bland fries that are too large and just aren't very good in general- I figured I could find something I enjoyed. 

Eh. First off, this location is always busy on the weekends. It's in the mall, so it's usually packed. Especially now that it's holiday season. We came around 3 on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy, which was nice. 

I ordered a strawberry lemonade because I remembered they had good ones. Should have looked at the price first.. $5 for sugar water with frozen strawberries.. Why?! It was good don't get me wrong.. But $5? I'll skip it next time. 

We ordered queso dip for an appetizer.. Honestly, this was the tastiest item we had. There was chunks of tomatoes and other vegetables and meat in the queso and I just devoured it. And for $5 it wasn't a bad deal. 

I ordered the soup and salad combo figuring that there's no way they could mess it up. Eh. The French onion soup was ok- the onions weren't cooked enough though and the cheese that was melted on top was entirely too thick. The broth was decent though. The salad was miniature.. And their croutons just tasted, off. Their balsamic also tasted just odd. 

My boyfriend likes their burgers, which is what they are \"famous\" for. I never tried one. 

I hope his red robin fix will be satisfied for at least another year. Just another disappointing chain."}
{"text":"We always have good experiences when dining at any Red Robin locations. They have something for the entire family to enjoy. 

The concept is definitely working on increasing it's price points and revenue per cover. The menu has gone from a single page laminated sheet to a book style menu like a BJ's or Cheesecake Factory.  The creativity in the kitchen is also showing with experimentation ' within the kitchen by offering different bun choices and even one made with ramen noodles. 

Join the Royalty rewards program because you can earn a free burger for every 9 purchased.  Also they give you a complimentary burger during your birthday month as well as embarrassing you with a boisterous song and free Sunday."}
{"text":"At this point I am basing this on strictly the employees for star rating. We are sitting in the center area and several employees are in their break it looks like. I have no problem with that, everyone deserves a break. If this is the only place for employees to take breaks, don't sit anyone in that area until they are done or it needs to happen. What is disappointing is that it has become a conversation and play area. We are watching active employees come and eat off of coworkers plates then go directly back to their customers or to the back to grab water, input orders and to check their teeth in the input screen, all without washing their hands. I'm an not up to date on health codes, but it just seems unsanitary. 

On the other hand our waitress(Brittany) is working her butt off. She is good about coming by to check on us and making sure our drinks are topped off. She is constantly on the move, but her taking great care of her tables. 

The food is decent. I had the French Dip with fresh, hot fries as I always ask for no seasoning on them. Kids had pasta with apples and a chocolate milk shake."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very friendly and the food was awesome as always. I got the Royal Red Robin...burger with an egg on top. It was delicious but ask for extra napkins! Good side items are the sweet potato fries and fruit. The cheesecake comes with lots of strawberries and goes down very nicely."}
{"text":"The restaurant was dirty.  There were wrappers and stuff all over the floor and the table was sticky.  I mentioned this to the server and he said it was because the busboy was washing dishes.  He didn't seem to care.  We left."}
{"text":"We were just here for a party of 15, we were already waited 30 mins. For my husband birthday we were in the bar area ordering drinks when this rude lady came up to us and told us to shut my nieces son up. My nephew Robert Mendoza looked at her and said that is what kids do (smh). A few minutes later the elderly couple was talking to the waitress and her husband proceeds to say well they can go wait outside. So upset and frustrated but biting our tongue. So then the manager comes and says can you guys wait in the waiting area and mind you waiting area was packed.  Then told us to get out never have we experienced such embarrassment and prejudice we are stunned never again will you have our business again below is a picture of rude old lady and waitress who didn't even apologize -- with Annamarie Zatarain and 7 others."}
{"text":"I had the mushroom and swiss burger with a side of macaroni and cheese. Both were very good. The service was slow and while not rude, was also not friendly."}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the food, it was delicious!!! The place was a hot mess, they need to improve their organizational skills. The hostess was spraying chemicals on a table to cleaning it and there was people eating around her, I have worked on restaurants and that is a big NO NO!!! They brought mac and cheese on a dirty plate and I had to chase a server to get silverware after I had my salad like for 5 min! I hope they work on it, the kids love that place and is close and convenience for us."}
{"text":"Best place in the area for brews and burgers. From the fast and friendly employees to the convenience of service. You gotta stop in the bar and visit with a guy named Skyler, one of the best bartenders around. Quick with a joke or a lite of your smoke, ha ha..They have patio seating and a cool chalk board up front for the kids to play on. I always have a good time here."}
{"text":"Let's just say the Guinness was adequate.  As for the service...non existent. Food was cold and and late. 45 minutes for a burger. Do not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I would have given this place four stars but had to deduct a few stars.  First off, the food was really good, I have eaten at Red Robin before but not this location.  My burger was tasty as were the fries.  My kids had the pizza and grilled cheese, I had just a regular burger and a drink and our total was about $20.  Not too bad especially when you are comparing it to fast food.  Our server was spot on, filling my drink when it was only half empty.  She did forget my boys chocolate milk and accidently gave it to the table next to us but stuff like this happens and I overlooked it.  

I am however deducting two stars for them having a military discount and taking it away.  Really?!  You can't afford to give the few military who may come into this restaurant a few bucks off their bill.  This really left a bad taste in my mouth.  I know the economy is bad and all but I hardly doubt that the CEO of Red Robin is hurting for money."}
{"text":"BOTTOMLESS FRIES!  Red Robin have their own seasoning to sprinkle over your fries or even on anything you want.  

Today we tried their Tortilla Soup, which is my favorite there.  I had the chicken Caesar salad wrap, which is like any other wrap. The bf had the whiskey chicken wrap.  Now that was tasty.  

Overall with the many times I've eaten here.  The burgers were \"okay\" Not juicy, which I like.  I didn't get the \"wow\" when I bite into them.  A nice casual joint for families."}
{"text":"Filthy, I had a very bad experience. We are the first customer that morning and we look at the menu to get started I order unsweetened ice tea I was so thirsty and drink the tea. The server gave me another glass of tea, while looking at the menu what to order I start squeezing the lemon and saw lot of black things on the bottom of the glass. I waited for the server and asked her what is it and respond she doesn't know and call the manager it took awhile before he came and he said doesn't know what is it. So disgusting, to make it short I will not recommend that place and will not go back again. Who knows how's the food preparation. I will recommend and proud to recommend In-out burger."}
{"text":"Red robin is a solid chain. This location is close to my house, so we have occasionally ordered take out from here or dined in when everywhere else was really packed. The service has always been really great. Their take out here is awesome- we ordered the burger with bottomless fries and since we weren't dining in, I asked if we could have extra fries on the side. Without hesitant, they said yes and we received two orders of fries. Pretty awesome. You can't go wrong with the burgers here, the delicious steak fries or their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Red Robin is a pretty awesome place to go for any occasion. My California Chicken Burger was delicious! I also had a mint chocolate chip milky milkshake which was AHMAAAZING!

Can't complain. The atmosphere was super retro and clean. I love how the walls are decorated with pictures. There were flat screen TVs...that was entertaining! This may sound weird, but the seats were super comfy.

Our waiter was good. He was a good server but just a little bit unfriendly? Maybe he was just on an off day or something...

My experience with Red Robin was overall great! I would recommend this to a friend! :)"}
{"text":"The food is okay, nothing special. I think it's overrated. Nothing special. I think there are more better burgers and fish and chips out there. I think it's only good for survival food. One star is because they have good service and that's about it and nothing more."}
{"text":"Waiter was overwhelmed and we had to wait about 15 minutes for drinks then never got water.  Orders were wrong. Extra charge on our bill for a game that was played on the little tablet that was never explained."}
{"text":"The food was decent, however I cannot say the same about the service. I was promptly seated, yet everything following that can only be described as slow and disappointing. After about 15 minutes, my waiter showed up and finally took my order. I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger and ordered a beer along with it. It took so long for the food to come out that I had already downed my first beer (the 22 oz I might add) before the burger even arrived. I typically enjoy eating my burgers with a beer, so I ordered a second beer. After waiting about 20 minutes and watching my food grow cold, I decided I couldn't wait any longer. I had only a couple of bites left before the waiter finally showed up with my second beer. The burger tasted pretty good overall, and the garlic Parmesan fries I had with it were surprisingly addictive. Had it not been for the poor service, I would have given my evening 4, possibly 5 stars. However the poor service makes me wish I tried another burger joint in the area instead."}
{"text":"Today I experienced the best service I have ever had in a restaurant of this type. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad to go, when It came out it looked awful; dry lettuce with a chicken breast on top. If I hadn't asked for tomato's it would've looked lifeless. When I asked the lady at the to go desk she really didn't have answers. A random waiter happened to walk by and she asked him if this was how it was supposed to be? He listened to what I thought was wrong with the salad and without missing a beat said to me that he would fix it. Sure enough 3 min later the waiter and salad were back every one of my concerns addressed and remedied. The waiter was polite, professional and spot on with the service he gave. I wish I got his name so I could put it in here. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is cause I haven't tried the food yet. 


(FOR MANAGEMENT) the waiter was medium build 5'11\" ish short hair scruf beard and tattoos on both arms. Let that guy train all of your servers and you'll have so much business you'll need a bigger location."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and went a few times a month, but now they have tablets on the table and they cause so many issues.
1. Service takes longer I had to wait 35 mins for a slice of cake, and 20 mins for a cocktail. Cuz the server had no idea I placed the order and I had to hit the button to call the server 3 times before I eventually flagged down another server to get my server. And the place was pretty empty it wasn't even busy. 
2. I got charged 1.99 for games I never played an entertainment fee. Cuz I tried to swipe out of the games to order a drink.
3. I had to listen to my kids whine for 15 mins that they couldn't play the games on the tablets that were on the table. 
4. They refused to remove the entertainment fee from my bill when I complained.
5. I sent an email about my shitty service and the entertainment fee and never got a response. 
So yeah I probably won't go back to red robins anymore.."}
{"text":"Awful service.  We had to flag down a server to get water.  Food was mediocre, and took forever.  Order a medium rare burger, and it'll come out well done.
Never coming back"}
{"text":"This was the worse red robin I have ever been to. The waitress was nice but the manager was really rude. I came to red robin to get a free burger for my birthday with my red royalty card. I didn't register the card until this morning which I called and asked if it was Ohkay to use. Someone on the phone said I could use it as long as I bring my id, which I did. The manager didn't do anything about the issue. All he said was it takes 24 hours to active and I could get use it sometime this month. Why would I want to come to red robin again within the same month? Maybe this place needs to replace the manager if they want people to come there."}
{"text":"Overpriced for mediocre burger and the Ensenada chicken platter was just ok!  Didn't taste like it wls freshly made ... tasted like already prepared and frozen chicken!!!  A little disappointed in that we hadn't been there in a while and now we aren't sure about returning!  Service was good! The fries are good!!  But having spent over $40 and only one beer!!  Too expensive for what we got..."}
{"text":"Cannot believe this place is allowed to represent the Red Robin brand. Upon entering, met by a snarky host- seats us by the bathrooms, after we clearly requested not to be. Place wasn't even half full, and there was a table, (clean) further away. Requested that table, he mistook one that was dirty and immediately replied \"I am not cleaning that table for you\" and walked away. Next, ordered spinach dip without onions. MANAGER delivered them to the table. Pointed out to her dip was ordered without onions. She asked if it was because of allergies, we responded no, just don't want onions. She gave us a nasty look and said \"Fine, we will fix it\"- when she returned with it, they had scooped out the center of the dip, covered it with a tiny bit of cheese and slammed it down on the table. Mind you we are in los of the kitchen.... so we saw it in action. Our food order sat in window for ten minutes, waiter and manager were giggling about it sitting there. Finally one waitress overheard our comment re be nice to get our order... brought it out, food quality was HORRIBLE. Chicken was old and rubbery- nasty. So, they get a star, not because they earned it, but because I can't  choose lesser value. Kenny- get it together, manager- take a nap or something- you are not a good example of quality service. It is no wonder why your staff are as poorly responsive as you are. Never again- matter of fact- considering call to corporate- so many more nasty little occurances, too numerous to list here. Stay away from this place, bad food, horrible service, lack of concern for the folks who patron this establishment. Have been to other Red Robins without issue- this place is awful."}
{"text":"Even though they're a little stingy with the fries, their burgers make up for it.  IMO the best burger, well, top 3 in town.  Also, we've always had great service here,  The blond lady, can't remember her name, great waitress!!"}
{"text":"There food and service has always been consistent, great to take family and young kids. Good value for the money"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the wait for the food was horrendous!!  We witnessed another family sit down after us, order, and get their food before we did and they weren't even that busy!!  We did end up speaking with the manager and she did explain to me that their head cook was a no call, no show.  Not really my problem, but she was really sweet about it and did apologize.  It would have been nice to hear from the hostess that the wait for the food would be longer than usual due to this situation.  This way, you know what to expect and are not sitting there chewing on your clothes because you are so hungry and see all of this food around you.  Our waiter was non existent, we had empty water glasses(a big no no in my book),probably because he saw us talking with the manager.  I will chalk up our experience as an off night.  I will probably give them one more shot and see if things have changed."}
{"text":"We were sat at a booth and waited for 10 minutes and not so much as a drink was brought to our table. The manager offered a free appetizer but I work nights and who knows how long we would have waited."}
{"text":"Wow, Charlotte is unfortunately not a good place for Red Robin. We thought it was an off day the last time we visited, however it's sad to say this place is awful. Last time we visited the food was cold, incredibly slow service, and it's only saving grace was the manager became our server because our waitress wasn't doing her job.  Going in tonight we said why not another chance?? Well after sitting for ten minutes with no help, three servers walking by and not even an acknowledgement, the manager I think who looked at us get up and leave without trying to help, and other staff watch us walk by without even mistakingly saying thank you...we left.   Dad because my family loves Red Robin.  Need a new one or an entire new staff."}
{"text":"The guy out front was right on the customer experience. Marco is a nice change for this place. We waited 20 minutes to be seated. No big. Busy Saturday night. Clean place and restroom. Waitress a little on the slow side. Took drink order 14 minutes later got them. Then took our order. If your in a hurry call ahead and get take out. Drinks awarding winning. But don't ask for sugar you still get salt. Ugh. If you are wanting water bring your own. Salad was amazing as well as fries. Cooks did good.  Overall - A three star review. The waiting staff really can make a great place. -------"}
{"text":"I can't believe this location only has 3 stars. Every single server has been fantastic and the food always great. My go to place for sure. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Service was poor.  Food was awful.  Too bad we can't give zero stars!  

Ordered a double burger and one of the patties was broken apart and split into several pieces - completely unappetizing.  (Wish I knew how to upload a picture of the deformed patty for all to see.)

To make matters even worse, when I pointed it out to the server and then the manager, I received a lukewarm response and a token apology.  They told me that they wouldn't charge for this second patty, but seemed completely oblivious to the unappealing and obnoxious appearance of the burger.  One would think that they would have, at the very least, offered to make another one.  

Instead, they gave off the clear impression that this was not out of the ordinary or something atypical for them.  It seemed as if it was no big deal.  Scary and troublesome.  I wonder what their health department grades have been.  

Suffice it to say that this was the last time my family and I will be dining there."}
{"text":"I love Red Robin's food, that I can say is pretty consistent, but the service at this location is sadly the worst. I try to give this place chances because it's conveniently close by with good food, but almost every time I've come here I regret it. I understand when a place is busy, but if the servers can't do simple tasks like give you napkins before or during your meal, or check if you need refills, then there is a problem. I even tried to utilize the \"call server\" button on the table tablet, and it literally blinked red until it turned off and no one came. I honestly don't know if I want to chance coming here again, solely based on the bad service every time. Good food doesn't cancel out being annoyed from not getting service and leaving unhappy after a meal."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  The menu selection is really good.  Not only are the burgers great, I have tried many other menu items which are equally good!  The bottomless fries is a nice touch too.  We come here often and have never had bad food."}
{"text":"Love love love Red Robin! Every time I come I'm so disappointed that it took me this long to start coming here to begin with! Food is amazing, Iv tried many things and I'm never disappointed! Service is always awesome as well!!"}
{"text":"I really have experienced better. One of the slowest and most awkward meal services I've had in a while... 

We came here this past Sunday, and the place was really busy-- I'll give them that. We were seated immediately, by someone who I presumed was a manager, and they told us our server would be right with us. Ten minutes later, the same manager came over and said that our server was too busy inputting orders for another table so he would take our drink order. As per their menu, I asked if they had Minute Maid Light Lemonade, and the manager-esque person flat out said no. I would have appreciated an \"I'm sorry, we're out\" or something, but I just got a \"no.\" I'm not sure if this had to do with incompetence or just laziness, but that was my first strike. I ended up ordering soda water and my boyfriend got Dr. Pepper. When I ordered soda water with lime, the same guy said \"wow, that's weird...\" Ok....? I didn't care what he thought of my drink selection, but I was more appalled at the way he was presenting himself. After he brought us our drinks, he asked is we were hot. The restaurant was significantly chilly, so we said no. He proceeded to say \"well I'm hot,\" and then walked to the wall and adjusted the thermostat. I was thinking to myself, no shit you're not, you're running around a busy restaurant... but whatever. 

Our server finally came to the table. No greeting, no introduction, she just asked what we wanted to order. We started with an order of mozzarella sticks, and said we weren't ready to order our entree. She came back two times while we were looking at out menus and asked if we knew what we wanted yet. Needless to say we felt rushed. Once we had decided, I ordered a bowl of the French onion soup with a side of broccoli, and my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and fries. 

45 minutes after ordering the mozzarella sticks, they decided to come out. They were good. Not the greatest I've ever had, but very consistent with Red Robin quality. No complaints there other than the time it took to move the food out of the window. While eating the sticks, we ran out of drinks and they were not replenished until after our food was delivered. Additionally, I asked the server 2 times for an extra side of limes and she never brought them to the table until the third time when my boyfriend asked and she finally delivered them after our entrees were brought out. 

Probably about 30-35 minutes after the mozzarella sticks came out, our food was delivered. I really don't think it takes that long to pour a ladle of soup into a bowl and steam some broccoli, but apparently Red Robin thinks so. Anyhow, my soup was lukewarm. The cheese ontop of the bread in the soup made up about half of the soup's volume, and because the soup was no longer hot it was the consistency of bubble gum. I picked it out. My broccoli was delivered separately, about five minutes after, and without a fork. I had to wait about 10 minutes to get a fork from the server, and by that time the broccoli was cold too. The fish and chips came out fine, with the exception of the server dropping one of the strips off the plate and having to bring another one a few minutes later. 

Overall, this 2 and a half hour dining experience could have been much more enjoyable, espcially considering that many tables around us that were seated after us with larger parties were attended to better and quicker than we were. Will not return."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Red Robin for a while and remembered really liking it (as far as a chain burger is concerned).  When my husband asked me to meet him there for lunch after he and his daughter were done shopping, I readily agreed.  

Big Mistake.

1.  Filthy.  Really disgustingly dirty.  There were plates and food on tables that was there before we got there and was still there when we left over an hour later.  Our waitress spilled some iced tea on the table and the floor next to us while she was pouring.  I'm going to guess 4 oz or so.  No big deal - it happens... But then, she didn't clean it up.  We were probably there another 20-30 min after the tea... there was still a puddle on the floor.  

2.  Miserable service.  I got there last & my husband had asked the server to bring me water so it would be on the table when I got there.  That was there... but she never refilled it or asked me if I wanted anything else.  I wanted a soda - but never had the opportunity to order it.  My husband had also asked before I got there, when I sat down and again when we ordered, if we could have a basket of fries as a starter (we ordered burgers, so it was part of our food).  They didn't get there until the rest of our order got there.  I was there over 30 min before we got food - he'd been there almost 10 min before me.  40 min.  And it wasn't particularly busy.  There were a few groups at tables, but at 3pm on a Sunday - the place was over 50% empty.  We weren't checked on, even after we had issues with the food (see below).  

3.  Mediocre (at best) Food.  When we finally did get food, it was mediocre at best.  My fries were ice cold.  They felt like they'd been sitting under the AC duct for a while.  I actually refused them because they were so cold.  My burger was passably warm and not particularly tasty.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't wasn't great.  I could make something better at home.  My husband's burger was even less warm than mine.  He said it was ok, but would have probably been tasty if it was warm.  His daughter had a turkey sandwich and soup.  She says hers was excellent.... so 1/3 of the party was happy.

I will not be going back to this location for any reason."}
{"text":"Same ole Red Robin. Nothing really great or bad about it. Great place for a burger and the bottomless fries makes it worthwhile."}
{"text":"Red Robin used to be my go to restaurant for every birthday. Growing up in Seattle, where the first Red Robin was opened, I grew up going to this place. I moved down to Arizona about 15 years ago, and I started visiting the Red Robins down here. I loved every minute; there was a perfect combination of bottomless steak fries and a unique atmosphere. But the last few years the quality of service has declined exponentially. The most recent time I went, something was different. Red Robin decided to install these bullshit \"Ziosk\" tablets on each and every table. What ever happened to enjoying small talk and interacting with other human beings? Even in the last 5 years with the introduction of the smartphone our social patterns have been warped. With the installation of these devices you no longer have to talk to the server. It's disappointing to see such a wonderful place of gathering spoiled by technology. I will probably never go to a Red Robin again."}
{"text":"Bahahaha, no way. Just avoid, too many great places in North Olmsted to dine at. 

I have my whole \"experience\" noted here, feel free to scroll to the bottom to see what three months of trying to help RR earns.

---Had my original experience 2016/02/13. Basically, they screwed up my order, and after contacting them with my list of concerns, they gave me a gift card to purchase my meal the way I ordered it the first time, as well as stated they are sending these issues to the branch to correct.

\"I have alerted both the 4949 Great Northern Blvd. Red Robin as well as their Regional Operations Director to this experience so that they may utilize your comments to help us strive to do better on your next visit.

My response, same day...

\"Kimberly,

       What concerns me is that my second last visit (to this store) was my third bad experience at a Red Robin this year. I sent in my first Yelp review, and a month later not much has changed. Yes, my food was correct this time (I don't count missing a pickle as \"wrong.\") but otherwise the issues that were brought up were not addressed. The only fix was that the lock to the stall now functions.

I don't use Yelp as a weapon, nor do I want anything from your company. I just had fun experiences here as a child, and always enjoyed Red Robin- but as I am spending money on myself and my companions, and as I grow a family, I am seeing more and more issues with your restaurants around the state. This concerns me, and I hope that this time the facility addresses the issues and makes a better experience for the customers.

Kind regards,
Steven K\"

Are you kidding me?
------------------------------------
2016/05/07; So, what happened today when I stopped in? Even though there was tons of seating inside, they had a lot of guests waiting. I assume it wasn't a giant party as no one was talking, and everyone was very casually dressed. Went to the restrooms, and nothing has changed. Toilet paper dispenser is still jacked up, sink is still a flipping sprinkler system, floor and counter was sopping wet (that's what happens when a sink is blasting water, and one jumps back!), and still no paper towels. 

I've been trying to help Red Robin to do the very basics in safety and sanitation, but I guess I've helped someone else. When someone slips and falls on the Slip and Slide floor in their, they'll have proof of three months of negligence."}
{"text":"Got an email for a free tavern burger meal with purchase of another meal so we decided to go for the deal what the add doesn't say clearly is that the tavern burger was a child size... Hungry husband wasn't happy, we spoke to the manager just like everyone else that night. Nothing was comped I emailed corporate, I got a response back they were going to forward my concern to blah blah blah never heard back from them... They lost our business!"}
{"text":"From 6/1/2016

Came here after the movies for some grub. This is my second time coming here but didn't leave a review because it was a crazy week.

We were seated and got a very animated server which was fine with me because I enjoy characters. 

We ordered some drinks first, I got the Skinny Lime Margherita, it wasn't that good in fact they put way to much lime in it to the point my face kept puckering with every sip. The server offered to put more agave in it but I knew that wouldn't fix it, that would just turn it into limeade. I bought a shot for my drink, and that seemed to do the trick. I do appreciate the fact that my server tried to fix my drink though 

We got out food, I got the Shroom Burger, which was tasty. I was happy with my service here even if the drink sucked, I would more than likely stop in again at some point."}
{"text":"I missed red robins from Texas, so I was happy to see that there is one here now. I took my family and they are awesome!!!! Balloons for the kids, a tablet on the table for games and to order appetizers, my tea was purple, it was there pickled pear tea, good and cool!!!! 
My family had a good time. The only thing that slightly sucked was having to leave, and the parking."}
{"text":"We came at about the same day and time again. This time there was a different mgr with mostly the same set of issues. 

1. No crayons and kids menu. 
2. Waited 15 mins when told 5. 
3. LOTS of empty seating. 

Mgr came over and had a different set of circumstances for what the issue was today.  Mostly people calling in sick. 

The server and food was perfect as always!"}
{"text":"I love Red Robin. Especially this location. I always go in, get my usual, enjoy every bite, go home with a smile on my face. 

RR is great for customizing your sandwich. I usually get the Burning Love burger, turkey patty, add extra cheese, remove salsa, add guacamole. Ranch in fries. Always great food here, never a disappointment.

A+++"}
{"text":"I have to come here once every several months because I have an out of town guest that comes in and this is his favorite place to go. I think their food is good. My burgers have always been good always prepared to order, & I love their bottomless fries.  But nothing is really spectacular. However, I think they are way overpriced. Service is usually  slow, and the food usually takes a very long time to arrive. If it wasn't for my friend coming into town. I would never go back.  I much prefer five guys. Even though this restaurant is a tiny bit more upscale than five guys."}
{"text":"We come in often, mostly for the great service from Mandi than the food. She is always so cheerful and attentive. While I see other waiters/waitresses that look like robots that just had a bad day. So we always wait for a bar table or outside patio table. With the remodel, kids are no longer allowed in the bar. They should be allowed but only at a table. In AZ, sometimes its too hot it sit on the patio and I just do not trust any other waitstaff member. Food is good. With they would change the \"Steak Fries\". They are not as good as the other food items."}
{"text":"How did my visit go? Hmmmm. Typical and nice visit to Red Robin. Ordered drinks and got them. Ordered some nice pretzel bites after getting those drinks. And proceeded to not get refill on my drink. For a nice and solid 45 minutes. He gave me my appetizer and my whole meal. But God forbid Jake the server couldn't refill that drink. So I  had sat there with both the appetizer and dinner sitting in front of me getting cold because he couldn't figure out how to take a cup and refill the thing. You have two jobs. Take people's order and refill their drinks. It will be a god damn cold day in hell before I return to that location. Absolutely pathetic."}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain restaurant!

Went here because I am a member of the Royal Club which means you are entitled to any burger on their menu for free for your birthday! How's that for being a member? I highly recommend you join their club so you can cash in on this birthday deal. Just go to their website: www.redrobin.com and sign up.

What I got was the Berserker Burger which was inspired by the movie Wolverine. It is a flavorful combination of zesty Aioli, Sriracha Onion Straws, Spicy Pickles, and Cheddar Cheese on a Brioche Bun. This burger is for a limited time only so get it while its still available! Of course, with any burger that you choose, you get their signature bottomless Steak Fries! Don't forget to put the patented Red Robin fry seasoning on there as well.

Service was good. We were greeted right away and was sat down. Our server came around and got our orders. I made sure to let her know I had the free birthday burger. I know some places when you get free stuff the quality of service tends to go down because of the big discount on the overall check. Our server did very well and I tipped her like I never had the free burger so she really deserved it.

The only thing that made me subtract a star is that when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, there were paper towels all over the floor. I notified a manager and they said they will take care of it. After finishing my meal which was about half an hour later, I went back to the bathroom again to wash my hands and it was still the same. So somebody failed to clean up. 

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised on how everything went. You guys just need to keep an eye out for your bathrooms."}
{"text":"This chain caters to families and mine definitely enjoys going here.  The burgers are pretty good and the kids menus are extensive and very customizable.  I have tried a number of the burgers and chicken sandwiches, all are very good and it's especially nice with all the items you can add or change in an order.  Also, the salads are quite good, with fresh ingredients, which you don't always get at a chain restaurant.

The wait staff is willing to customize and is always friendly, no matter how many changes we ask for.  This customizability makes it great to bring the kids, and not always have them eat fries with their meal.  Another great thing about this particular store is that the staff comes by so frequently to refill the drinks and fries that we hardly ever have to wait for anything.

One drawback about this location is that on the weekends, possibly due to the movie theater, the parking lot and restaurant can be quite full.  It can be an ordeal finding parking, with 3 restaurants so close to each other in a small lot.  Additionally, the noise inside on a Saturday night makes it hard to hear each other.

For families with kids I highly recommend Red Robin for their large kids menu, their good burgers, and fresh salads."}
{"text":"The food we were served came out well after it was prepared.  The service we had was sub par and the greeting at the door was absolutely lacking.  The only thing I can say is that management said something to the individual at the front for not greeting us nor opening the door.  So hopefully the employee understands the importance of.  Usually Red Robins are good to go but, this one was just A-ok..."}
{"text":"Burgers not as good as advertised. Service is fine as long as you get a decent server. Don't ever use a restroom in a red robins no matter where it's located. It is nice to see vegetarian options on the menu."}
{"text":"We love to visit this place as a family for a quick, delicious burger and milkshake! The little princess definitely says Red Robin is her favorite restaurant. The servers are great here, and always accommodate our needs!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night to celebrate our birthdays. We love the Red Robin Royalty program. We both got our free birthday burgers. Not only did we enjoy the food(which was actually 100% correct and perfectly done this time), but we had a great time and enjoyed our overall experience. In recent visits, we have had many complaints and issues, so bad that we've debated ever going back here. Since we were getting free food anyways, we figured we would try again. Melissa was amazing. She was on top of our bottomless fries refills, rootbeer float refills, and even noticed we didnt have napkins or silverware and brought those to us before we even noticed. She was very busy, had so many tables, but she still took such good care of us. The other servers should take notes from Melissa, she is the best server we have ever had at Red Robin. 
  Only a couple of small issues to bring to managment attention:
1.) No light on our booth, light above us was blown. It was difficult to get good lighting for birthday pics
2.) The food took a little long to get to us, but we were in no rush, it came out hot and fresh, and was all correct.
3.) One of the female servers who is alittle on the plus size( no shame in that as I am as well), had the back of her shirt pulled up, showing her back side and slight underwear showing. Maybe an undershirt would he helpful?
4.) There was a dirty towel sitting in the same place on a ledge near us the whole time we were there.
These are the reasons I have a 4 instead of a 5. I was actually pleasantly surprised with our experience and I will continue to go back, especially if we can keep.getting Michelle for our server, or ones.just like her. I also.have to mention the hostess(didn't catch her name). She was such a lovely girl. She greeted us and sat us promptly. She was such a sweet girl and had a genuine  kindness and beautiful smile. On the way out the door, she actually got to it and opened it up for us befire we got there. She set the tone for the experience, as she is the first and last one we see. This is the experience we and everyone else should get every single time. These girls have really raises the bar, hopefully we can expect consistency in our future visits. Thank you girls and the rest of Red Robin employees who worked last night, for making it such a nice birthday dinner for us.

P.S. Happy Birthday, Melissa!"}
{"text":"Never have I wanted to walk out of a restaurant before receiving my food. Never. The waitress was distracted at best, and at one point completely disappeared for over 10 minutes. Meanwhile, 3 servers and a bartender laughed at things on their Facebook apps, etc. The on duty servers were more concerned with those not on shift. We asked for fries to come out soon, and everyone else got their food before us. 
There was ONE other set of people here in the bar area.  One. The rest of the restaurant was also fairly dead. It was 7:15pm when we walked in and it took an HOUR to get our food. Our original waitress didn't even serve us!

I won't make it a point to come here again. Horrible service, for food that's not even that great. All we wanted was a fairly cheap and quick bite to eat. Completely ridiculous is what this is."}
{"text":"I always prefer local joints i.e. non-chains, but was kind of forced to make the trek here for this lunch. First, I'll say that chains like Applebee's and Chili's pump out a much higher quality product than Red Robin does, and at a comparatively lower price (I was blown away at the cost of this lunch of 2 sandwiches, 2 fries, and a milkshake). 

I ordered the A-1 Peppercorn burger and endless fries. Safe choice, no way it could be that bad (and it really wasn't). For an 11 or 12 dollar burger at a chain restaurant it just wasn't anywhere near worth the cost. It was a GOOD burger; probably an 8 out of 10. However, it wasn't filling, and the bacon on it was thin and low quality. The taste was pretty much there.. very good. 

On to the fries: big and bland. Salt, pepper, their special spice seasoning, and ketchup - still not very good. But, they're endless. So what my burger lacked, I made up with fries to get my money's worth! Not ideal, but this man's gotta eat!

Red Robin - not terrible, but needs a little TLC. Make your 12 dollar burgers 12 dollar burgers and not ones that should be $6-8. Applebee's/Chili's/etc. over Red Robin."}
{"text":"my husband lOVES burgers and fries, so we decided to come here with friends for a casual birthday dinner. we've been to plenty red robins and always know what to expect- the food isn't absolutely amazing, but it's always pretty good and usually a fun spot to come to. but THIS place had the most awful service ever!!! the girl that served us acted like we were in her house irritating her. every time we asked for anything she would disappear for a long time, roll her eyes, or walk away without saying anything only to bring it about 15 minutes later. haven't really experienced such blatantly rude service in a long time so i was very surprised. my food was fine, but she let our plates sit so long that my husband's burger was soggy by the time he got his plate. such a disappointment.

Update on 10/7/14:
About a week ago, the manager got in touch with me and apologized for the bad service, and offered to hear our complaints and send us a gift card. I really appreciate efforts to repair broken relationships, so I'm really grateful that they care about their customers! My first review was 2 stars, but because it seems they are really trying to improve their service, I increased it!"}
{"text":"Great place to go meet with family and friends for a fun time and a delicious all American meal with dessert. Come enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is a miss 70% of the time. The service at this location is generally subpar at best.  First our pretzel bites arrived burnt and rubbery so they bring back a new batch with the old cheese... YUM. Not. Then the food arrived cold after we waited for it forever watching it sitting in the pass but it never got to us until it was too late- seriously! Trying to play it off like it was hot off the grill. Disgusting. Poorly managed. Poorly excecuted. Please get some help."}
{"text":"Went here with co-workers (because you know I am disenchanted with this chain) didn't really have a choice... The price was kind of steep in my opinion. The Royal Robin is what I got and was very soggy half way through and started falling apart. It did have an over easy egg on it... but still.... Felt very bland. The side salad was good and tasted fresh and I like that it came with a tiny garlic bread. The fries are okay but the seasoning isn't quite like I remember and just tastes more salty than flavourful. And they dont really come back and ask if you want another serving... just saying- i thought they were 'bottomless'... I got a diet coke and the waitress seemed to forget about us after we paid our bill I was dying of thirst due to all the salt. My bill was like 17 something (plus a tip) and I kind of feel like that was highway robbery. I just feel you can get a better lunch deal elsewhere... It's not that is wasn't filling-- I am over full but I just feel like salt is the only thing coursing through my veins right now... ugh. I really hope my co-workers don't drag me here again... :/"}
{"text":"We ate lunch yesterday with 2 Great friends & everyone ordered the double cheeseburger & fries. Nate provided Excellent service & our food was superb! Can't wait to go back SOON!!"}
{"text":"We have nicknamed this place \"Red Flag\" Let me explain why..... 

We are very laid back so for me to write this is a big deal. Accidents happen. Short staffed ok no problem. Restaurants get busy I totally understand that. But if you see the parking lot slammed your better getting out of there & going else where. TRUST me on this!

After being seated and it took 27 minutes just to get our drink order in & another 10 minutes of waiting to get them since our server was chatting it up with his buddies.

When he finally made his way over we placed our order. My husband is a strict vegetarian and explained that to him \"our server\". He stopped by to tell us our food was being \"plated\" Then headed over to chat with his buddies again. 17 minutes later & waiting almost an total of an hour on food my husband was served a turkey burger after explaining in detail to the server he is a STRICT vegetarian. 

Sent the burger back. New burger came with additional flavors since all they did was swap the meat out of the bun replacing it with a veggie burger.. 2nd time it went back. Out again & still wrong. None of the toppings were added or correct & the server had the nerve to say they \" oh well they were there the whole time you just didnt see it\". I have 20/20 vision and There were no toppings on that burger. Schedule yourself an eye exam. Period. 3rd times a charm they say? Final straw here my husbands burger came back with \"hairs\". Not a strand but strands. We'd had it by this point being starving and certainly cranky after waiting so long For food only to deal with this.

 l Now that being said they were VERY busy and we expected to wait (thats not the issue). It was the continuous mistakes, the server caring about talking with his friends & ignoring our needs as customers, questioning us on what we ordered when it was their mistake and so on.

I truly enjoy going here with my family but I have a different attitude after today's visit and most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Just had the D.G.B which stands for damn good burger, It is a top class burger that melts in your mouth. It also goes down perfect with a lager beer of your choice. I would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Regretfully my visit today was so bad I had to leave before eating. Manager was very rude and made everything worse. Poor service, ignorant manager - you can get a mediocre burger other places. Stay away."}
{"text":"Honestly I dont see the big deal. At least at this location, i dont know if it was just a slow day or what, but our hostess was very monotonistic. Not engaging in any way,  then came our waiter and he was just....ugh. uh, lets see, he was very pushy about us ordering and he really had no people skills. He looked annoyed and honestly the whole service was below average. 
Now on to the food: 
I got a Classic red robin burger and it was OK....nothing special about it. Very bland and the bread tasted stale, it needed alot more work... My friend ordered the garlic fries and honestly it looked like they just topped it with garlic salt and what seemed to look like cheese. Overall very \"meh\". Don't give into the hype."}
{"text":"Burger was good - juicy and delicious. Fries left much to be desired. It lacked the crispy outside I like in French fries. I remembered them to taste a lot better before they made them \"bottomless fries\". Perhaps they've downgraded. 

We also shared some wings as an appetizer. They were barely warm but flavor was great. The \"fresh made kettle chips\"  that accompanied them were also cold. They tasted like bagged potato chips. Will come back for burgers, maybe."}
{"text":"A burger joint is just that but our server was great abd the kids really enjoyed their meals"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and ordered 3 different things, and each visit has progressively gotten worse.

Visit 1: Clam Chowder Soup - pretty good actually

Visit 2: Mushroom Burger with Endless Fries - eh, pretty good, but I've definitely had better and it's pricey.

Visit 3: Salmon Burger ($10.81) - I can make a better salmon burger than this. It consisted of whole wheat bun (not grilled, just soft), grilled salmon (that was dry), lettuce, and tomato, with Side Salad (super small salad but the honey mustard dressing was one of the best I've had). I would've given Red Robin 2 stars, but I felt that there was a lot of salmon in my burger, which is rare in salmon sandwich/burgers."}
{"text":"DO NOT order takeout from this location. The past 2 times I have ordered online I waited 30+ minutes past the \"Order ready at\" time. There is no point in scheduling a pickup time if it is completely disregarded. 

Food quality is average and inconsistent, generally only go here when others want it or I get a coupon for free or discounted food."}
{"text":"We were there on Sunday. As usual, the service was horrible!!! Not only did the food take forever, but our server was the worst at making up excuses for his inability to write things down. To top it all off, one of our dining companions saw a rat on the plumbing located along the notheastern wall of the patio. I've said it before...if this place doesn't fix their ossues fast, Bravo Cucina is gonna take all of their business!"}
{"text":"Server was awesome. When Shannon opens up his place, y'all better go. Not sure what's gonna be on the menu, but you're gonna have to go.


I had he burning love and it was out and prepared properly within 5 minuets.

{"text":"We come here fairly often and the food is always good and service is what you would expect. Except for tonight. Tonight we had Enrique as our server and he gave us service you would only expect from a 5 star steak house. Our drinks were never empty, he was friendly and joked with our big party, he checked on our party frequently and made sure our food was up to standard. More servers should be like him. It's people like him that keep us coming back. Great job Enrique!"}
{"text":"Ok, the last time I was a Red Robin was over two years ago. It's not that I don't like the restaurant I just don't live close to one. I'm extremely glad that my wife and I decided to go tonight. Our server Paul was on his game. It's like he could read my mind and replenish my drink or fries before I asked. The restaurant also has a kiosk at each table to order, get more drink, pay the bill, ask for the server. It was great. I ordered the buzz mac and cheese burger. Two patties with mac and cheese between them. I live mac and cheese and the idea for this burger was great. McDonalds Big Mac has nothing on these all beef patties. My wife ordered the Caesar salad w/ clam chowder and garlic bread. She said the salad was so good that Caesar Augustus probably made it himself. Clam chowder was on fleek and garlic bread was delicious."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon. EXCELLENT service by the hostess(don't remember her name) Extremely friendly and kind. Sydney was our waitress. She was friendly and knowledgeable. As we spoke to her we realized that she was the bartender and also serving tables. I remember coming last time and they would use their employees in this way. As we observed her activity at the bar increased where she had to make everyone's drinks. But in doing that her attention to our table became less and less. To the point where we no longer were given refills and the bottomless steak fries were not replenished. It's not Sydney's fault, I just wish Red Robin would use their employees in a more suitable way."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Our server, Holly T. was rude and inattentive to our table. The manager didn't seem to care either. They brought me a burger covered in a sauce I clearly asked for on the side, then charged me extra for the sauce I didn't want. 

When I asked them to fix my meal, all they did was take the burger back to the kitchen and wipe the sauce off with a napkin. The worst part of that is not only the napkin debris on my burger, but they didn't get all the sauce off. It was terrible.

We were supposed to get \"bottomless fries\" and my wife went her whole meal without getting fries. They put 6-7 fries on her plate initially then we waited about 15 minutes before we had to chase down the ever so rude waitress and ask her if we could have more fries. 

My daughters mac&cheese looked more like soup than mac&cheese.

Terrible service from our waitress Holly T. and the food sucked as well. They did nothing to fix my situation or make sure I was satisfied as a customer.

On top of the rude service, wrong order and dirty looks from the staff, I was overcharged on my bill.

We came here a few times a while back and it was ok, but now we will not be back to this place, ever. I do not recommend this place to anyone. 

Save your time and money."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give this restaurant no starts I would because one star is way too many!! It's 3 am and I just finished puking the last of the nasty burger. Me and my husband were there last night and had 2 different burgers. While eating my burger I started to feel sick right away. So I only ate half. My husband on the other hand ate his whole burger. As we are getting home he start to complain about his stomach and that he feels awfully sick. Upon arriving home he throws up right away.  We both got really sick. It was our first time going and let's just say we will NEVER be back again... oh and the service was horrible!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I saw the prominent \"Gourmet Burgers and Brews\" signage from the back and sides of the building and thought this was a new local spot we should try. After parking and heading towards the entrance we noticed the Red Robin signage and almost turned around as we are not big fans of chains. We kinda felt like they were trying to trick us with the signage. We have never visited a Red Robin, though, so we decided to give it a try. 

Upon being seated we noticed 4 dirty tables that remained uncleared throughout our visit. The service was quick and our waitress was delightful, but we had to ask for napkins, silverware, and missing sauces after our meal was delivered. I had the Black and Bleu burger that, while tasty, is grossly overpriced at $14.99. My wife had a bowl of clam chowder that was served in a shallow bowl, only 3/4 filled. It came with a small piece of very burnt garlic bread. Luckily that's exactly how she likes it. 

The beer selection was very small, but my wife's Long Island Iced Tea was excellent. Not a terrible experience, but definitely not worth $44 before tip."}
{"text":"After our last visit to Red Robin on January 4th, I am updating my review. This was the Red Robin that we are used to eating at. The food was great and Shelley was a fantastic server."}
{"text":"Apparently, when I say I hate Red Robin, people react as though I'm saying I hate Disneyland. 

I just can't get into the jar of mayonnaise, shredded lettuce and tasteless meat they put into their burgers.

Gourmet burgers my ass.

Fries were great, spinach and artichoke dip was great. 
I guess I'll eat vegetarian here."}
{"text":"Weekend evening after Thanksgiving at the San Tan Village mall, again!  We just wanted a quick bite before watching The Muppets.

Not bad  My little cutie pie and I shared the seafood platter and a bowl of clam chowder.  Hubby got the bacon burger.  Nothing special to really write about.  Just your average satisfactory American food joint.  

Very good and fast service.  We will come back here again before another movie day."}
{"text":"Our server Becky was excellent. She made sure our drinks were full all night. Food was hot and very good. Mind you it was busy Friday night and we still got great service."}
{"text":"I'm not too sure why Red Robin overall has lower rating, but in all honesty, I think Red Robin is great for the burgers. I always stick with the royal Red Robin burger and I have never been disappointed. The service could be better, but it isn't necessarily bad. I see this location always busy, especially during the weekends, so I'm sure there's quite a lot of people that agree with me. Anyway, it's a good family restaurant, and it surely won't let you down. You know what to expect and they always satisfy you. Kudos to Red Robin"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Got charged extra for beer cheese that came with Pretzel bites and charged for a video game that we didnt play."}
{"text":"For a burger joint I am not quiet sure how they can mess up a burger 2 times in a row....Been here numerous times with no issues but I've also had numerous issues other times. I enjoy the burgers and fries most of the time. I guess its hit or miss at this location."}
{"text":"This location is much better than the other locations I have visited. The staff seems to be much nicer and helpful and the food is usually right on. Love the endless fries!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location three times since moving here. I used to love this chain. Good burgers and bottomless fries, what's not to like? Well things have changed. The burgers are now mediocre and the presentation is lackluster. The \"bottomless\" fries are now served in a tiny tin cup thing that gives you 10 fries at most which means you eat them in the first two minutes, and that leads to the reason for my low 2 star review. Service is less than adequate. The company in trying to save money has increased their servers work load to the point of ridiculousness. If you have 3 people eating and everyone eats at a different pace that means the server will have to refill each persons side at least once, that's minimum of three refills per table and if the server has 5 tables that's 15 trips to the back to get just refills on sides, not to mention taking orders, running food, refilling drinks and any other responsibilities they may have. This company has destroyed a good thing. I will no longer spend my money in a place that consistently frustrates me."}
{"text":"First and foremost I'm a huge fan of the brand. I've been a customer of RR for over 10 years. So much a fan that my family and friends typically get me a gift card for RR for the holidays or birthday.

Sadly this has to be the worst RR I've been too. 

Started out as soon as we walked in. They seemed extremely under staffed for lung time. We came in around 130 last Thursday. We were seated at one of the only clean table in the dining area. We counted 9 tables that hadn't been fully bused. Drink glasses everywhere. Ok, I get, slammed and short staffed. I work in the restaurant industry so I get it.

We went ahead and ordered and I as always got the bottomless rootbeer floats. It's a bargain for 4.99. Tree the Blue Ribbon burger also with my bottomless fries crispy. That was the first time we saw our server. Didn't catch her name. Tattooed brunette. Well I was thirsty so the float lasted 2 minutes. Put my glass politely at the edge of the table to signal her.

A runner or another server brought out our food. Our server didn't come back to see if we needed anything. We sat there for about 10 minutes waiting on someone to ask if we needed anything because we did. We needed a side of their chipotle mayo and a side of blue cheese dressing and I was in desperate need of something to drink, a refill on my route beer float.

Our way to finally saw that we needed something as I politely called out to her across the dining room. I guess there were a couple of regulars and she was busy attending to them. Mind you no one has attended to the nine tables with dishes and drinks on them. She came up give us a look and we asked for the refill on the route beer float and the sides of dressing at which point she made no apology and just informed us there be a surcharge for the chipotle mayo. She brought the float back first. By the time she went to the kitchen and came back with the dressings I had already finished the second float and aspirate third. Both empty glasses remained at the table while she rushed to the bar and brought me a third glass.

But now I had already finished my third float and my crispy fries were soggy from sitting around. I went ahead and ate them because I was starving. Another 15 or 20 minutes past and my fries were empty and I still had half of my burger left and yet another empty float. She came back after I had to call out to her once again. Asked for one more float and another order fries. The float came and added to the three empty glasses that I had. After she cleared the table the fries finally came out along with her pointing out that we can pay online.

Not sure what the issue was, maybe they were just all having a bad day. But it's definitely not the Service and attitude I'm used to when I go to RR. Definitely won't be back to this place."}
{"text":"Good thing I wasn't expecting much. We stopped to get a quick bite after Christmas shopping. We were seated in an area that was absolutely filthy. We asked to be moved.  Only slightly better because I didn't have to step over all the fries and crap on the floor that obviously hadn't been swept.  Got a garden burger. My beloved had the fish and chips. Only so so.  Service was fast.  What were we thinking coming here?"}
{"text":"Red Robinnnn   [YUMMMMMMMM]   
Sorry... it had to be done!  

Anyhow, this one is very much like all of the other Red Robins out there!

Located inside of the South Hills Village Mall (at the former location of The Roxy Restaurant), its quite smallish inside for a Red Robin location.

It can be absolutely nuts on the weekends with families trying to get a table for 7 on a Saturday night, so steer clear of it on weekend nights!

The food was average, at best, and of the same quality standards as all other Red Robin locations (which sits at \"just below average\").

Burgers and chicken sandwiches are the main event here, though there are some salads and Roast Beef Au Jus sandwiches, too.


Service was very friendly today (7/9/11), but there was no pre-bus which is a huuuuuuge issue for me!  I want those dead soldier dishes taken away from my table ASAP and hate it when restaurants/servers fail to deliver (or remove, as it were).
We also sat with our check (ready to pay) for quite some time before our server finally took our card for us.


The Breakdown
PROS:
Food Quality is Consistent to all other locations;
Service was Friendly (though the hostess staff was pretty disorganized);
Refill service was fantastic!

CONS:
NO Pre-Bus!   GRRRRRRRR!
Failed to cash out our check in a timely manner (we seriously sat for a looooooong time to get outa there!)



FOOD RECOMMENDATION?
I liked the Roast Beef Au Jus Sandwich (mentioned earlier)!
The meat was good quality and not gross at all.  The bun was nice and chewy.  The Au Jus coulda been a bit more flavorful, however.


[sorry, though I usually try to comment on the facilities, I didn't use the bathroom in this location.]"}
{"text":"We come here kind of frequently but we ate on the patio tonight from about 7-8pm and I forget our server's name but he was absolutely phenomenal! Super attentive and quick didn't have to ask him for anything as he was on top of it all before I even needed to. I have never had service so good at any restaurant I have ever eaten at. He should get employee of the month!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with excellent service ...very tasty..if you have not been there in a while it's changed so much for the better"}
{"text":"Great burger, nice atmosphere, awesome service. I love the Banzai Burger I highly recommend it. Good appetizers with lots of options. It's a great place for families and very kid friendly. I always try the burgers and never tried anything else."}
{"text":"Good variety of burgers. Love the guac bacon burger and bleu ribbon burger. Also love this location it's smaller than most RRs but less busy also."}
{"text":"Every time we want a big juicy burger and fries this is our go to. Not to mention the kids menu is great too! Even on a busy night we had great service."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries are delicious. Service was fast and friendly. I love paying at table and being able to order without waiting for the waiter."}
{"text":"I like Red Robin but this location isn't as nice as the others.

It's always too cold and noisy.  It's inside the South Hills Village Mall which is upscale but the people here are ghetto?

This location is always more dirty than the others. The floors are dirty, my seat and table had food on it, my table computer was broke, they forgot my special ketchup flavors, service was a little slow........... That's all"}
{"text":"I love the broiled  burgers are superb.i went at lunch and it was super busy so we sat at bar with quick friendly service.i got the blue cheese burger.great.the onion strings were soggy .but no biggie.i want to go back and try more.and I picked up a there 20 spice blend for 3$.love it.stay classy yelp."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Bottomless root beer floats and fries are worth the trip alone."}
{"text":"I had an excellent dining experience! Not only was my meal incredibly delicious, but our server Damon was exceptional! I felt very comfortable eating here and I will definitely be back. Five-star service all around!"}
{"text":"I ate here while traveling from out-of-town and was so impressed with the service, quality of care taken in preparing my food, and my actual meal I just had to leave five stars.

My server Evan...fantastic! He took care of me from the minute my party walked in. He guided me through Red Robin's gluten free menu on the iPad and explained how it would show him how to safely prepare my food. He was very willing to answer any questions and patient. When he was unsure of an ingredient or if a dish needed to be modified, he said he'd rather err on the side of caution and would double-check everything. 

I ordered the Ensenada chicken platter, which was delicious! Everything was cooked perfectly and the portion size, especially for lunch, was huge!

Thank you, Evan and Red Robin, for a pleasurable and safe dining experience! Traveling for GF diners can be challenging and stressful, but this particular location went above and beyond to accommodate my needs."}
{"text":"Under a ton of stress, having the worst G.I. (as in stomach upset, etc) of my life and finding it very difficult to eat and keep anything down.  My son went out to get dinner and I couldn't come up with anything that sounded okay to eat.  He came home with a to go order of Red Robin's bowl of French Onion Soup.  My son rides a bicycle everywhere and Red Robin's not too far from our home, but not right around the corner either...  The soup arrived just hot enough to be palatable and tasty, no burning of the tongue and not so cold that I had to re-heat it in the (ugh) microwave in order to enjoy it.  
To my pleasure the soup was topped with the traditional crusty bread slice and a thick slice of cheese that was melted perfectly - slightly gooey yet chewy too just the way its supposed to be, IMHO.
The broth was just a bit on the greasy side but that's probably where a lot of the incredible flavor comes from.  The onions floating in the soup were cooked just a bit more than crisp-tender so they weren't soggy and slimy but rather kept their form and texture without that raw onion bite I detest so much.
The soup came with pita bread doused in garlic and cheese sprinkles.  Yum, my tummy was not just satisfied but ecstatic and (in case you wonder) the soup stayed exactly where it was meant to stay, in my stomach... my apologies if you're eating a meal whilst reading this and have a vivid imagination..."}
{"text":"The menu is appealing from start to finish. So many options. I went with a Smoke and Pepper Burger. I also had a side salad and fries. The burger was excellent and packed with flavor. I added a touch of Garlic Aoli sauce. Very satisfied with the fries and side salad which are \"bottomless\" so you can eat as much as you want. I had root beer cake for desert. It was delicious and pleased my sweet tooth, but at $6.19 it was grossly overpriced for the sliver I received. It was about the size of my cell phone. I joined their royalty program because they will soon be opening a Red Robin in my hometown. I hope it helps offset the prices which are a little high. I can't imagine taking a family to eat there."}
{"text":"Server was good, always refilled our drinks and the food came out fast. Bacon burger and royal robin was awesome! Only problem was that it took long for them to refill our \"bottomless\" fries."}
{"text":"I love Red Robin, but this location is awful. I attempted to eat here 3 weeks ago and after being seated and waiting at my table for 45 minutes with no acknowledgement what so ever, my friend and I just left. Gave it another try today. The service was great, but the food was not. My boca burger was cold, my friend found a hair in her ranch dressing, the appetizers we ordered were way more greasy than usual, and my fries were sad lumps of soggy cold potato. The tables and menus here are always really sticky, which is pretty gross. I'll be sticking with the Independence location from now on."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place for burgers and I love their home made sugar donuts!

This time I tried the A1 Peppercorn burger it was peppery and good. I love their choices of ketchup!"}
{"text":"I like RR and the kids love RR. The bleu ribbon burger and the guacamole burger are the go to burgers. Sometimes they will have special burgers not on the menu but on the table as advertisement so check the table for any ads. I love to try new burgers on the ads, that's how the pub burger was born and now it's on the menu.  Great burger!  The fish and chips is also quite good for a burger place.  Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and priced fairly. I struggle to find healthy options on the menu at this place and it's been packed with kids each time I've gone... so inevitably, you'll be forced to hear one of those annoying happy birthday songs. All and all, it's a chain restaurant so it's what you would expect. Staff has always been friendly and quick with orders."}
{"text":"Red Robin is what it is, so I'm basing this review against like kind restaurants (chili's, olive garden, etc...) Had a great meal, cheap cold beer, and a good experience. Food came out very quickly, bartender was a really nice guy. Also looked clean and well managed."}
{"text":"You gotta love free stuff!! So in continuance of my birthday freebies, I headed to Red Robin, where I had a coupon for a free gourmet burger. I had the pleasure of being served by Miss Bonlie and I have to give her a huge thank you for spoiling me today. You rock girly! 

So after having Miss Bonlie patiently wait for me to decide which burger I would like, I decided on the Santa Fe burger which omg was amazing! So amazing that I ended up bringing half of it home because it was MASSIVE!!! My goodness. It had guacamole, fire roasted poblano peppers, yummy for my tummy sauteed onions, tortilla strips, pepper jack cheese, and chipotle mayo. Yup there was even lettuce in there somewhere too, But it gets even better, after not being able to take another bite and packing up my leftovers, Miss Bonlie brings out a free hot fudge sundae for my birthday too. Now yes they do that for everyone if you tell them its your birthday but man, I must admit, I felt pretty freakin special. Oh and I forgot to mention, I was dining alone :) So I got to people watch while people watched me. Pretty entertaining to say the least. 

So Red Robin gets a major hats off for filling up my tummy with the yummy goodness of a great burger, all you can eat steak fries, and a hot fudge sundae to top it all off. This is one happy woman!"}
{"text":"Like many self-acclaimed foodies, I struggle with giving reviews to national chain restaurants.  But you know what?  Ef it.  Red Robin is SOLID.  I've never had a bad meal here, nor bad service, or been seated at a trashed table or seen the bathroom look like a diaper bomb went off int here, and I've been here during full-on-family-fun-zone-packed-prime-dinner-times and can still say that.  It's one of my favorite places to go before or after catching a movie at the nearby Cinemark.  My only problem is that by the time I polish off half a stack of onion rings and whatever giant burger strikes my fancy, I'm nearly ready to explode by the time I finish chips and start eyeballing those grown-up milkshakes."}
{"text":"My wife and came here Friday night food and service was very good. Our server was there to check or drinks and making sure everything was good and bringing us our endless French fries. The manner even stopped by to make sure the customers were happy and doing ok."}
{"text":"The food was 2 stars.  We ordered a chopped salad with a processed chicken breast with grill marks and bacon cheeseburger.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because the burger was good.  Ordered alcoholic drinks which were just nasty."}
{"text":"Excellent service by the staff tonight!  We were seated quickly, our drink order was taken immediately and our appetizers arrived all within 15 mins of being there.. Food was also very good! I will be going again and recommend this location."}
{"text":"This place is always GOOD! When me and my husband were moving here, we ate at this location. The waiter was helpful and gave us suggestions on were to look for a place to live etc. Since moving to Vegas, we have been here countless times and we always leave happy.

We always get the burgers and fries here. The Royal Red Robin is a favorite. The fries are always hot and crispy too.  

The service is always good and friendly. We will continue to make this place a regular stop. Just not all the time. We can't afford the calories. Haha!"}
{"text":"We typically order take-out from Red Robin instead of eating inside. The food tastes good and is always ready within 20 minutes of ordering. My only issue is that they just seem to throw our food into the to-go container. My burger is always falling apart. They definitely don't care about presentation for the to-go orders."}
{"text":"We really had a great dinner. Our server was amazing. Our drinks were always full and she never seemed annoyed with all of our requests.  We had 10+ people and everyone enjoyed their meals.  We will be back :)"}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times. It's pretty good food overall. They usually have a hard time getting your food out quickly and hot. Unfortunately this seems to be happening more often than not. Recently, while waiting a LONG time for our order to arrive, we thought we saw our food sitting in the window for a while before it arrived at our table. When it finally arrived it was cold (not surprisingly). They re-heated or re-made it for us, but that added to our wait (which seemed really long already). Not a great experience. 

We like that you can get the fries out before your meal, this keeps our \"starving\" children from whining while they wait. But even this isn't consistent. Some visits we get them early, some we only get them w. the meal. Their burgers are good, prices fair, but the coordination in the kitchen needs great improvement."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and ate. Everyone was courteous. I had the peppercorn burger with onion rings instead of the unlimited fries. The food was good and my burger was remarkable."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Red Robin's when I travel. We went for dinner, and the staff was super friendly, and the food was fast. 

The place was pretty empty, and the AC was good. 

The food? It was okay. It was definitely greasier than my usual Red Robin expectations. My tavern double bun was visibly greasy. My husbands burger was the same way. 

If I was in my twenties I wouldn't have cared because it still tastes good, but I'm twice that age and have old man heartburn. It might have been a one off, but I wasn't in town long enough to check."}
{"text":"Pricy burgers should be $$$ but that being said it's up scale great for grandma. 
With drinks"}
{"text":"The food is good. However, every time we go there, something goes wrong. For example, no guacamole on the guacamole and bacon burger. Or the appetizers come out to the table cold. Or there is a sick hostess on duty who coughs and sneezes all over the menus before handing them to you. Simple, basic things that shouldn't happen but somehow do. Is this a management issue? I don't know. Too many other options in the area to worry about it."}
{"text":"I was craving Red Robin so we stopped here for lunch. We put our name in for 2 and a high chair and took a seat. After waiting a while we could hear who I assume was the manager discussing seating with the two hosts. Despite hearing one of the hosts saying that we had been waiting, the manager kept mumbling about high chairs and table numbers. They proceeded to seat 3 parties that had arrived after us (including two parties of 3). At which point we left & drove through In n Out. Apparently I was mistaken in thinking Red Robin was a family restaurant...pretty freakin disappointing."}
{"text":"Where to start...well let's just say we will never come back to red robin. we went at around 230 in the afternoon and didn't leave Red Robin till after 4. we were told the wait would be about 15 20 minutes which turned into 30, fine I understand that some places get busy not a big deal. We sat down we were greeted by Irene she seemed very sweet. She took our drink order and we also put in the kids meals right away too. my sister was visiting out of town so it was me, my mom, my sister and her daughter and my son. we also ordered chips and salsa. we got our drinks right away but couldn't get our appetizer for at least 15 minutes and the kids meals never arrived. I asked her what was going on she said she didn't know all that she knew was that the kitchen was backed up. so no explanation as we just sat there and continue to wait.  no manager ever came to apologize or ask us if we were okay, we also watched three different tables walk out. our food finally got there after 40 minutes but it was just me my sister and my mom's food, still no kids meals!!! we said that this was unacceptable and we asked to have our kids meals and why they were not there. a girl came by and said to Irene it was never put in, the kitchen had no ticket for it. finally the other girl ran back to the kitchen and got our kids meals after another 10 minutes. we still were missing one of the sides with the kids meals and it also never came. all of our food was cold it was awful but we still ate it because we were so hungry and had waited so long. finally we got the bill because we just wanted to get out of there and nothing had been discounted or taken off for all that we had been put through. so I asked for the kids meals to be removed, which they did and it took 12 dollars off of our bill. not to mention that the place was pretty dirty and it seemed like nobody really cared. We also watched one of the male servers walk by and wipe his nose with his hand like he had a cold, at that point I put my burger down and was done eating. I am a former server myself I have done this my whole life and never have I been the type to complain but this was the worst thing that we have ever seen in a restaurant and the lack of people to care. usually a manager comes over and tries to reassure the table or will give you some type of comp or let you know that they care and this did not even happen. never have we been so disappointed. I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone. the staff was awful the food was awful and the place is dirty."}
{"text":"We come to this place pretty regularly and the food is always good.  The service is good.  This last time we had a great server.  It was busy but we still got great service.  Food came out hot and was very good.  I ordered the Big Ghost burger, so good (love spicy food).  This is one of the better burger places I've been to in the area.  I would recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"We've been here numerous times and each time the service continues to get worse.  One visit took 30 minutes before we got our food.  We talked the manager and he said, well we are busy and the kitchen's slammed.  That was it, not even an apology.  On our last visit the cup of soup was cold, so we sent it back.  After waiting and waiting the server finally came by and apologized for the wait. He said that they ran out and had to make a fresh batch of tortilla soup.  The new soup finally came out and guess what, it was also cold.  We are done with this location!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a very late dinner w my partner. The area was unbelievably clean. We were taken care of by BRIAN and he blew my experience through the roof. He explained the menu to us, brought us our drinks in a timely manner, along w waters. Our food was perfectly cooked and hot. He treated us w such kindness and sincerity. Offered us a peach shake that was left over and also told us a bit about himself. He took amazing care of us and his other tables. Exceptional service, food, and ambiance. Thank you, FARSLY. Will return soon"}
{"text":"Had a good night! The food came quick, and was perfect! The ice cream machine was having issues and our server let us know so we knew why our floats took a bit to get to us. Jess was fantastic as our server! She kept our drinks full and she checked in regularly and had a huge smile and was very pleasant!"}
{"text":"Great food
Great service 
Good clean place 
Nice hosts
The cheese  hamburger is awesome very well done to my likening the fries are great. I will be back again."}
{"text":"We went to dinner last night to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  It was our last night in Vegas and the restaurant was close to the hotel.  We told the hostess it was my daughter's birthday, we told the server it was our daughter's birthday, he asked for our rewards card - we gave them the number it was tied to and the birthday was registered in the system.  We had a nice dinner and when the check came he said you had a coupon for $5 and leaves.  We paid the bill and we hung out at the table for another 10-15 mins, no birthday singing.  THAT WAS THE WHOLE REASON WE WENT THERE, rather than grabbing a cheap buffet.  My daughter was so bummed."}
{"text":"Always great service from the crew in the Adults Only bar seating; consistently good pub food faves.  Expect at least one birthday party whenever you go...."}
{"text":"A little disappointed with our visit at this location. My family of four went on a weekday around 5pm, so seating was easy and quick. We sat at a booth and were constantly bothered by a child climbing over our booth. What was most annoying was the child belonged to a crew member eating with his family. Fortunately they left after 10 minutes so the crew member could return to work. 
When our entrees arrived I inquired about our appetizer.  They said it was burnt and brought out another. Didn't want to eat an  appetizer with my meal. They didn't charge us for that. 
Had to send both my kids meals back because because they were cold. 
Both my wife's and my meals were average. Desert was good and price was reasonable. 
Wasn't expecting any type of comp (didn't ask for a freebee) but apology seemed a little less then genuine."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and courteous. Unfortunately burgers were underwhelming ...there are so many places to get way tastier and less expensive   Burgers....sorry  RR"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with my family. First, we were waiting at the host stand for five minutes until someone even came to seat us. Then we were sitting down for ten minutes until someone came to our table to get our drinks (wasn't even our actual server who came to the table first) then we waited for ten more minutes until our drinks came, which they forgot my moms beer. Five minutes later her beer finally comes (15 minutes for one beer) then our actual server, Ryan, comes. (We were sitting down for about 25-30 minutes until he came to take our food order. I ordered a burger and I asked it with no tomatoes since I have a slight allergy to tomatoes. And of course when my burger comes it has tomatoes on it. Overall terrible service. I was a server for five years when I was in college and service this bad is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Red Robin in a very long time and will not be returning any time soon.  I had their chicken sandwich and fries.  The fries were not quite cooked and the sandwich was flavorless.  The  service was good and the staff was very friendly which is why I gave the review any stars at all.  The restrooms were not very clean either.  Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"I paid extra for the garlic parmesan fries. I get home and I have plain regular fries. Pissed. I paid for the garlic."}
{"text":"Was sat by hostess Cassie at a small table next to the kitchen. We asked her if we could move further in to the restaurant as it was very loud where we were. She was irritated by our request and acted very inconvenienced. She said the whole restaurant was loud so we shouldn't waste our time unless we wanted to sit in the bar. We asked if we could at least try another part of the room and she again said the whole place is loud and should go to the bar. Since Cassie was so inconvenienced by us we decided to leave and go somewhere else. Disappointing for a local spot."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was slow.  Could not get a refill on our drinks and the waitress was sitting in another booth and having lunch with a couple of people   The hostess did not greet when we arrived and did not acknowledge when we left.  There was 3 cars in the parking lot and hardly anyone in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Unlimited French fries and strawberry freckled lemonade will always keep me coming back for more! This location recently remodeled bringing a more hip and trendy feel to the restaurant along with table side appetizer, drink and dessert ordering on little computer screens. The new technology doesn't take away from the customer service though which is a challenge in itself! I always stick with the chicken bruschetta sandwich that has a delicious tangy sauce all over. The happy hour is worth it (3-6 and 8-close) with plenty of drinks and appetizers to chose from. Definitely give this place a try when you're resting up from all the shopping!"}
{"text":"I was watching my 3 y/o nephew on Saturday and I told him we could go out for lunch. At first he said he wanted a bagel for lunch, so visions of Poppyseeds started dancing in my head. But by the time we were ready to go the fickle kid decided nope, he wants a cheeseburger! 

I tried to go to Big Daddy's but there was a 20 minute wait and the little guy said let's go somewhere else. I remembered seeing Red Robin further down the road so we went there and thankfully were sat right away. I got my nephew a kids cheeseburger and even with all the options for sides he wanted apple slices. I got the chicken caprese sandwich. 

The food came fast, which is good with kids. I wanted a burger but knew I'd be better off with the chicken, so I tried a bite of the kids and it was really good. My sandwich was good too, basically grilled chicken on a soft ciabatta bun, with lettuce, balsamic marinated tomatoes and surprisingly good fresh mozzarella. I asked for the pesto aioli on the side. It came with the steak fries but I only ate 3 of them. Not a big fan of these wish they were crisper. 

All in all a pretty good experience and definitely reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We don't visit the franchise restaurants to often but Red Robin gives you a free burger for your birthday so we go twice a year. The burgers are good and every burger comes with unlimited fries. We've been here 4 times now and the service was good each time and it always had a good crowd. 

Sign up for there email list and you can get the free burger to. They don't send tons of emails so don't worry about the spam. I'd eat here more often but like I said we don't like visiting the big chain restaurants. I'd rather spend my money supporting a small business owner. I suggest the burger with the egg on top. I think it's the Royal burger???"}
{"text":"Good food. Slow service and I mean SLOOOOOW. Took over 30 mins just to get the bill. Also, the onion rings is overpriced. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday evening at 4:30pm. Hostess screwed up seating us thinking we were another family and we got their table which made things feel weird.

I ordered a short stack of onion rings and the pretzel bites. The cheese dip for the pretzel bites was cold and had a skin over the top when it was brought to the table. The pretzels were half soft half tough. Would not get again. 

The onion rings were great but they don't provide a plate with the onion rings so it makes a huge mess as you bite into them and breading flakes off and falls all over the table.   

The atmosphere is very loud and you have to yell to talk to people across the table."}
{"text":"The waiter would not put on the England vs. Slovokia and I asked about 10 times... The food was very good tho"}
{"text":"Went to Red Robin during preview week and was blown away by the excellent food and outstanding service. We had Bonnie blu for our server and she was a subject matter expert on all menu items and a hospitality goddess making our table feel right at home. The draft selection is stellar and the apps and entrees came out quickly and cooked to perfection if only we could have had dessert! Oh well, we'll be back and ask for Bonnie again as soon as they open!!"}
{"text":"Burgers: Great.

My score is purely due do their hostess and I wish I remember her name, but I don't. I dined here today (04/05/17) at 4:30 pm.

As soon as I walked in with my husband she offered me a kids menu. I am 5 ft and have a young face but I am certainly not a KID. This was enough to ruin our meal, making it awkward and the only reason I didn't leave was because we were starving after a hike and my husband was craving a burger, so I stayed for him.

You only have one job: sit people. Don't open your mouth if you don't know people's age, relationship, etc."}
{"text":"I agree with all the low star reviews at one time this was a good place to eat. They are very understaffed leaving long waits for seating and food. I will not return"}
{"text":"Pretty good place; especially for family. Good food; my sons and I had gourmet burgers, which was good. Others in our party had Chicken fingers, and a salad wedge. All in all it Red Robin was an okay experience. I would imagine we would come back again, mostly however, for the atmosphere. Personally I feel the price of the food wasn't worth the quality but maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"We got in after waiting for only a short time. The service was outstanding! The manager was actually walking around and helping the servers. All of our burgers were good and the desert was tasty! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food went down hill. Not even appetizing. GM took it off the bill but wasn't even concerned about how different and disgusting my meal was. When I ordered, the server avoided simple service steps and just kept talking about the stupid machine on the table and how to use it. You work in a restaurant not the matrix. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is me and my family's favorite place to go on special occasions! We just went for my sister's birthday. It was packed, but the host Julian was very attentive and efficient with not just me and my family, but everyone waiting to be seated. He is fast! After we were seated, we waited for our food which didn't take long at all. Josh was a great server! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, this was the first time eating at a Red Robin. I was recommended the Chop burger from our waitress Tessa. The burger didn't disappoint and neither did the customer service. Excellent service from our waitress Tessa and the manager who kept checking all of the customer to make sure we were all being taken care of. And the Root beer floats were bottomless. The best type!"}
{"text":"It's Red Robin but not as good as most. We had to find a server to seat us. The fies tasted like the oil they cooked them in was old. The burger was good but not as good as usual. Couldn't figure out why. Maybe it was be."}
{"text":"Hostess did not sit us for 5 minutes waitress never came by to get our drink order for over 5 minutes as well the appetizer was the best part of the whole meal never got any extra fries sauces were not there right with the meal the both of our burgers were not cooked properly substandard service never return to this Red Robin ever again and I love Red Robin's burgers"}
{"text":"We always order to go & the girl at the bar, I think her name is Kate is the best! She NEVER messes up the order, everything is always on time & fresh....best thing about Red Robin? Campfire Sauce...BOOM....Mic Drop...there it is"}
{"text":"Red Robin has a classic diner image in both the food and the restaurant decor itself. The are a fusion of old diner style burgers and shakes with a TGIF/Applebees blend of modern comfort items. The even change up their burgers from time to time and theme them up like the 5' alarm burger."}
{"text":"This is the newest Red Robin in the Vegas area located in Downtown Summerlin.  Love it!

Realize first that this is a chain, which has had \"gourmet\" burgers.  It's not like some of the local places so if you're looking for unique, bypass here.  But I love it here because you can get seated quick and get a delicious burger with bottomless steak fries.

Service was great when we went which was the second week of opening."}
{"text":"I got the a1 peppercorn with chli cheese fries and it's off the hook . the waiter is really nice and makes sure our drinks are full and everything's fine with us which is a good thing because I tip on good service not good food . All in all Red Robin is  a good place to eat just don't expect to pay what you would pay for fast food especially since the food is far from mediocre."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I'm a fan of Red Robin.  For a chain, the food is decent and service is usually stellar.  However, this particular location on the particular day we visited did not live up to what I was expecting.

We arrived after the lunch rush and before the dinner rush, but we still had to wait.  What was really odd about this is that there were numerous tables empty throughout the place, but everyone that came in was told there was going to be at least a ten minute wait.  Ok, whatever, maybe there was an underlying reason for this, but when the line starts backing up to the point that people are walking right back out, that's not a good sign.  When my party was finally called, they tried to fit five full grown adults into a single booth.  I excused myself to use the facilities and when I came back I noticed my party had moved to a roomier circular table.

To say that things started to go downhill at this point is somewhat an understatement.  Our server, I'm sorry I don't remember your name, was less than enthused to be working.  He had the personality of wet paper bag.  So monotone that it was almost impossible to hear him over the music, television or other patrons.  Hardly made eye contact and had a very flat affect.  Once our drink and appetizer orders were in, we didn't see him for a while.  A while in here turns out that we don't see him again until the appetizers are ready.  Our drinks followed shortly after.  We placed our orders for our burgers and it's like the grade of the hill we were sliding down increased a whole hell of a lot.  

Typically when you order a burger here they will ask \"pink or no pink.\"  I, along with several other people in my party, ordered our burgers with no pink.  When the burgers arrived what we got was no pink, but it was more like charred black.  Each bite of the burger you could taste how burnt it was.  We had asked our server before he disappeared again for some mustard and extra napkins.  How long did it take for him to return with those items, just under fifteen minutes.  During those minutes, I watched him stand within plain sight of our table, not doing anything (honestly dude, if you hate the job that much, look elsewhere for employment).  

Then when it came time to pay, it took forever.  I opted not to get another drink, but should of, that's how long it took.  The smoothest part of this whole operation was walking out the front door to leave."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place, but something is lacking here.  Like they left something decline here.  The service is so-so, and the food is sub par.  To me, it seems like they haven't cleaned off the grill or something.  Evey thing seems to be filled with tons of grease now.

I use to love the bottomless fries, but not so much anymore.  That says something coming from a potato lover.  

It's like this place feel into a rut and cannot get out.  Like they became too comfortable in what they do and just decided one day that what they do will remain the same and people's attitudes won't change.

I do give you big props on the now endless root beer float.  But my burger was kind of blah.  I ordered the Royal Red Robin and thought it'll be great.  I've had it before, and this time I was so underwhelmed I could have stopped on my way home at a fast food joint and been more satisfied.  The egg reminded me of a plastic one you see in a kids toy set.  I'm sure if I were to have dropped it, it would have bounce.  The bacon was undercooked and so chewy that I pulled it off the burger and discarded it.  Even the tomato on the burger was making me want to gag.

I remember when the place first opened and I was one of their first customers.  It was pretty amazing and dazzling to be inside, but now I feel like this place has turned into Chuck E Cheese for adults...it's lost its luster."}
{"text":"Fries were cold, a1 burger was cold... thats all i have to say. Not returning to this place for sure..."}
{"text":"Been here several times.  The food is consistent and very good in my opinion.  I love the thick steak fries.  The service, however, is also consistent; bad.  On our most recent visit our server didn't know which beers they had on tap, and didn't bother to go find out.  It took over 10 minutes to bring our drinks and take our order.  The manager actually came and took our order before we got our drinks.  Will go back for the food, expecting poor service."}
{"text":"I used to go all the time!! For the past 2 years they have not done good at all!! The food at least is still great so I just thought the waiter or waitress was having a bad day!! I am not a complainer and well now on this case I had to say something!!! The other day on Thursday was the last straw!! Got there about 6:30ish and it was busy but no wait to be seated. The waitress Rachel said she would be right with us and that was fine! Then when I ordered the drinks and appitizer it took at least 15 minutes then I noticed that the sauce for the pretzels there was very little and when I showed her Rachel said \"oh but we will have to charge .25 cents\" so I said no thank you!! If you would of made sure that it was filled in the first case then I wouldn't have to pay...here's the best...my our drinking glasses had lipstick on the rims!!!! EWWWW
I didn't say anything and just had to wipe my own glass which was bullcrap!! I know Rachel saw me wiping my own glass and walked away...I work with the public as well and let me just say I was so very disappointed and will never come back!!! I lost my appetite and wasn't able to eat anything else because this place is not clean."}
{"text":"Best location in all of Vegas. Server was Marcus and he was the best server I've ever had here. Works hard and made sure my girlfriend and I were taken care of. Highly recommend everything here"}
{"text":"Good selection of burgers and drinks.  Excellent bottomless fries.  Tops for a chain burger place."}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer of Red Robin's throughout the us and while some are better than others, this location is sadly the worst I've ever come across. My first visit there back in December with out of town guests (grandkids in tow) was a very expensive and unsatisfactory experience.  Not much was correct or edible about our $160 dinner. 

Fast forward to today. My guests were another grandchild and my daughter. It started off sketchy when we ordered our drinks which consisted of a lemonade, an iced tea and a chocolate milk. The lemonade was watered down, which indicates they need to refill the syrup, and the iced tea tasted like burned rubber or plastic. After letting our server know, and not getting so much as an apology, my daughter ordered a coke and I requested a hot tea and a glass of ice.  Next, was our meal... my daughter wasn't asked until after we were completely done with our meal if she'd like more fries, and my avoCobbo salad was missing the avocado, and the chicken was charred and dry. I told the server about the avocado and she delivered 3 skinny avocado pieces, again, without so much as an apology. The tomatoes in the salad appeared to have been diced a few days ago since they were mushy and not the right color. The table was never cleared of the iced tea and lemonade that we had replaced. And the food overall was again below mediocre. 

As much as I have enjoyed Red Robins in the past 30 years, I will never again attempt to give this one another chance. I've thrown enough hard earned money away giving this one close to my home a chance to redeem themselves. This Res Robin gets an F in my book. 

You would think, with as many good restaurants in that immediate area, they'd try a little harder to please their customers."}
{"text":"Located in/near the perimeter of Downtown Summerlin, you will find this Red Robin location next to the Panda Express. We had dinner after watching Suicide Squad with a couple of friends of ours. The 4 of us decided on Red Robin when trying to figure out where to have a quick, casual bite to eat.

(+) This location is relatively new and is very clean and has a fun, festive atmosphere. Plenty of TV's and seating available
(+) the bottomless fries were actually pretty tasty and I did enjoy them. I noticed during our meal that we had to be fairly proactive about asking for refills. It just seemed like they weren't going to volunteer or offer refills willingly.

(-) I ordered what was marked as a new item, the Clucks and Mac and Cheese ($12.50) and later my friend treated me to a basket of bottomless fries (sorry, I didn't catch the price). The mac and cheese was a pretty small portion. Even worse, it didn't taste all hat good. Very bland and watery. When I ordered the clucks, I assumed they would be regular chicken fingers, but they were lathered in a buffalo style sauce, which I am not a fan of at all. Instead of interrupting the flow of the meal for my guests and myself, I decided to just give it a shot. 

Eh. 

I just didn't care for it. It does come with a side of ranch, which made it a bit more tolerable, but I was wildly unimpressed.

(+/-) Service wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't very good either. The young man who helped us was nice, but also seemed a bit lackadaisical. One of the burgers was ordered without onions and came chock full of onions, sauces were forgotten, and the bottomless fries plates were taken away with no offers to refill it until we pushed the issue. I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but the service was just not very good.

(-) Our friends tried to use their Red Robin rewards points card and it was nothing but hassles and issues just trying to get their \"points\". Seems like a lot more hassle then it was worth.

I left Red Robin just very unimpressed last night with absolutely zero intentions of ever coming back. There are just too many good places to eat  this town, and even in Downtown Summerlin,  to come back here.

2 stars.

Meh. I've experienced better."}
{"text":"We've lived in the area for over a year and this was our first visit to this Red Robin. Reading the reviews I wasn't really sure what we were going to get but this ended up being such a great experience!

Granted, we went at around 8pm on a Monday night, so the place was pretty slow. In fact, I believe there were maybe 5 other tables occupied in the entire place. 

So when we first walk in, we are greeted at the door and seated by the greeter and less than 2 minutes later we are greeted by our server, Steven. We order our drinks and Steven mentions a few suggestions since we had mentioned this was our first visit here. Upon his recommendation I ordered the Royal Red Robin burger(10.49), while my friend ordered the Chili Cheese burger (9.99). Both burgers came with \"Bottomless steak fries\". They do give you the option to switch those out with a different style of fries, if you wish. We stuck with the steak fries and figured we'd just go with that. 

I had been craving a burger all day, so sinking my teeth into that tasty burger was sweeeeet! Very fat and juicy! Plus I love the over-easy egg on top! That was the first time I had tried that on a burger and I definitely enjoyed it! The steak fries were the thick cut variety (which I love) and were pretty tasty as well. After 2 servings, that seemed to be plenty for me. My friend seemed to thoroughly enjoy his chili cheese burger and also indicated other burgers on the menu he wanted to try out on future visits.

The service was great! It was perfect that Steven was attentive and brought refills in such a timely fashion! He repeatedly checked in on us and attended to our needs during the meal. Just because a place is slow doesn't necessarily translate to great service. Trust me, I've experienced that first hand many times. But that certainly wasn't the case here! In fact everybody here was so friendly, we even had 2 other employees wish us a good night as we were heading out of the place. We were both like, \"Damn\"! lol 

I honestly can't think of a reason why this wasn't a 5 star experience. It was pretty much a flawlessly pleasant experience and we will DEFINITELY be back for multiple visits! I just hope future visits are as good, they've set the bar pretty high for themselves.

So, based on my experience, I have to give Red Robin..

5 stars!"}
{"text":"When coming here stick to the burgers and Frys. Had the croissant and clam chowder. Was not impressed. The best part of the meal was the fries and ranch.  
My kids got Mac and cheese and they give it in a small bowl. My boys are 7&9 they were still really hungry."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location since the remodel. I gotta say, I miss the carousel horses and the airplane fan. It was so whimsical and fun. I was pretty bummed out when I saw they got rid of them. I am an old man....it's not often I get to relive the things in my childhood I loved. My childhood memories were squashed like a bug on the windshield of life. *le sigh*

The carousel horses and fan weren't the only things they got rid of. Apparently they took the staffs personality and fun attitudes with them. This place used to be full of smiles and bubbly humans. Sometimes they were so happy, it made me wanna slap em. Luckily I no longer need to worry about a possible assault charge. No one was rude by any means. But they certainly weren't happy or inviting. Our server was direct and to the point....no frills or extra personality. Can't say I was or wasn't a fan. I just was.....

Ordered the Chips with \"more guac than ever\" and salsa. I don't know how much guac they had before, but it must have been enough for a 1/32 of a teaspoon per chip. Literally we had about 1/4 cup of guac. I could use that on one chip. Come on people. The worst part? The chips came out stale....so we sent them back for replacement chips. The server didn't hesitate or complain and it was back lickity split.

Split the Pepper & Smoke burger no bun and steamed broccoli. I loved how they actually brought us two separate plates and sides. The burger was very good and the steamed broccoli was cooked perfectly.

The restaurant was clean and we got sat right away. Can't say I'd go outta my way to come back to this location, but I'll be back at some point."}
{"text":"When it comes to burgers, I like to think of myself as pretty well versed. I mean, I am a carnivore. Some would call me the carnivorous?  Cassanova. Ok, maybe only I would call myself that....but just go with it. Nonetheless, I love me a good burger. Smothered in cheese. Topped with veggies. YES YES YES!

Red Robin has changed over the years. Portion sizes have shrunk, prices have risen and the menu? Well, it just isn't the same anymore. The \"appear\" to have lots of selection, but really....it is the same burger reinvented over and over again. They try and glamourize it with fancy names and catsups, but they aren't fooling me. The biggest problem? The price tag that goes with it. They have become ungodly expensive, while the portions are half the size. Seems kinda shady to me. The redeeming quality would be the unlimited refills options. Not only can you get a semi load of fries.....but you can do steamed broccoli, salad and sweet potato fries now. Makes the refill options more healthful!

We were greeted at the door by a bubbly teenage hostess who took us to our table. A great way to start the dinner. She was very sweet and engaging. The restaurant appeared to be clean and I love the decor. Our server was a nice guy....although not very attentive. His kind nature made up for his lack of presence. 

I ordered the Royal Red Robin wrapped in lettuce. I like this burger because it is solid and filled with protein. I added bacon (because porcine goodness makes all things right with the world) and I got it cooked as rare as they would let me....which isn't very rare lemme tell ya. The burger came out cooked well done (as I asked for pink) and the lettuce wrap was an absolute mess. I asked for a side of mayo and got a teaspoon of the stuff. I love me some mayo, so I had to ask for 2 sides more to make it worth my while. The egg on the burger was cooked perfectly and the pepperjack cheese I asked for gave the sandwich a nice flavor. The bacon portion was VERY small, but cooked properly. Overall, I would rate this burger a 2.5 out of 5. 

I ordered sweet potato fries as my side to start. They came out a little on the cold side, but the flavor was very good. Shake on their Red Robin seasoning and you are golden. No catsup needed for these babies. The second refill I got was broccoli. I was actually grossed out by the texture. I could easily mash it with a fork....wayyyyy too soggy. So, I ordered a salad instead. The salad was fresh (although more white than green) and I loved their ranch dressing. 

The bano (bathroom for my non Spanish speaking friends) was clean and well put together. They get an entire star just for this in my reviews. 

Overall, I would say this visit was just ok. Would I go out of my way to come back? Probably not. But, the free birthday burger and unlimited refills of salad and sweet potato fries definitely make me come back at least once a year."}

I have never seen anything like this. The manager took my wife's entree off the bill which was $60.00. She received her entree after everyone else ate and it was still cold !  The Manager popped an attitude and said we are busy! Only a handful of tables with patrons and servers standing around ?  It seems I got the kind of service Linda S reported in a earlier review . This is the Red Robin at Galleria . I should have read brad  T review , it seems we went the same night !"}

{"text":"Nothing more than lousy bar to drink in while other are shopping since its inside the village mall.

Sat down at an empty yet filthy bar. The girl working was very unpleasant. I asked for a drink menu but was told it was \"way outdated\" and many things on it were \"crossed off\". 

So I ordered a margarita, which was fine. Face it, how hard is it to put tequila and triple sec in with some cocktail mix....

Then I ordered boneless wings. She asked if I wanted ranch or blue cheese. I said BC please especially if it came with celery. She said she would make sure mine did. 

About 15 min later, crusty hard, half cold nuggets of chicken came out. Sucky tasting. No surprise.... And of course, the curdled looking blue cheese was not accompanied with celery. She sure did make sure. The place was slow, no surprise again, and she never even noticed. Frankly she couldn't care a bit.

WONT BE BACK!!!! Crap spot, crap service, crap food..."}

Acted as though she was too busy to help with a to-go order. Then She proceeds to take my phone to a \"manager\" who then returns to give my phone back and says \"at least you got a free burger!\".... with a nasty attitude as well! Will definitely not recommend this location as they seem to be too busy to deliver customer decent service. Very poor staff!"}

We were a party of 5, 3 adults and 2 kids our waitress brought out 3 forks and 2 knifes? 

It seemed as if they had their d team on shift! 

The girl that brought our drinks out, was wearing a shirt that was way to small for her and I could see her belly showing..... idk the entire experience was just bad!"}
{"text":"I'm not in Centennial very often, but my boyfriend needed to exchange something at the Ross nearby. After doing what we had to do, we wanted something to eat. Originally we were aiming for some Mexican Food, but we saw Red Robin right next door and my boyfriend suggested going. I've never been to Red Robin before, so of course I said yes. 

The place was pretty empty, not surprising since it was only 11am and they just opened. We were seated and given water. We ordered a bowl of clam chowder to share since we didn't want to get too full before the burgers came. The waitress brought it out in two small cups, which was very nice. The soup was light, but very flavorful and pretty yummy. Each cup came with a small piece of bread that went perfect with the soup. 

My boyfriend ordered the Guacamole Bacon Burger and I ordered the Pub Burger.  Both orders came with bottomless steak fries.  We also ordered peach tea and freckled lemonade, both were bottomless as well.

The Pub was okay, nothing too great. The Guac Bacon Burder, however, was mouthwatering and the steak fries were very savory; I probably had mine refilled like 3 times. 

I really like that they give you bottomless fries with your burger and it's an added bonus that the specialty beverages were also bottomless. 

The service is fast and friendly and the food is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Waited almost 40 minutes for my tortilla soup...which was average....burger looked sloppy and didn't come close to a \"gourmet burger\".  Meat was overcooked, the lettuce soggy, and the black plate it was served on had water marks and looked dirty.
Fries looked like they had been sitting around for a while and were soft.  The plate looked awful....wish I had a picture."}
{"text":"Went yesterday after the hubby graduation.  We had to convince his parents that this location is okay because they had horrible experiences at the tempe location.  Martin was our server and was friendly and attentive, didn't come by too often or not enough.  All of our food came out right and my sauteed mushroom burger was so good that it was stolen by my daughter. 

 Would have given 5 stars but the restroom wasn't totally clean, and an employee had even gone in there to fix her hair but didn't bother to clean it at all.  The fries weren't fresh, and the water has a weird taste to it, like either it isn't filtered or the line needs to be cleaned."}
{"text":"Normally we have great service but the last time we went our server forgot about us. He took about 10 minutes to greet us then he took our order and only came back once to deliver the food. We ordered pretzel bites and they came out burnt and disgusting and the cheese had an off taste. The burger and the salad were decent and the strawberry lemonade was amazing like always. We were supposed to have bottomless drinks and fries but we never had the chance to ask for more. Maybe that's how they make money, they simply just ignore you and don't offer refills on drinks or fries.. Maybe this was just an off day for them but come on."}
{"text":"(3/31/18) I keep hoping beyond hope that this place will one day get better. All of the burgers that I wanted to order have been tasteless in my previous reviews so why bother? I did order the bottomless root beer float again. Its always good.
Today I've ordered the voodoo fries to start with both ranch and ghost pepper sauces. Hopefully it will be flavorful. I ordered a black and pepper burger for my entree. Hayley is our server and seems to be friendly and knowledgeable.

And like magic she appeared beside me with another root beer float! The voodoo fries are spicy but not flaming hot. The sauce with the ghost peppers is more flavorful than hot, a nice surprise.

The black and pepper burger was flavorful. That too was a nice surprise. Apparently the trick to the burgers is to order the newest on the menu rather than the procession of tasteless ones that were once good."}
{"text":"Food was good but endless frys is a lie. Once served. waitress never returned untill it was pay time. It wasn't even busy..."}
{"text":"My lunch time \"culinary co-horts\" and I ventured out for a burger today and we ended up at Red Robin. Normally, I wouldn't consider writing a review for a large chain restaurant, but I made an exception today. Primarily because I was impressed by the menu.

We've visited the Tempe Marketplace location before and the service was less than spectacular. We were prepared for another long lunch hour so when JC arrived, we ordered our food along with the drinks. Crisis avoided! JC's service was much better than our previous experience. Plus, the table top pay stations made it a breeze to split our check and pay.

I didn't have time to fully explore the menu, but I liked the updated selection of burgers. There was some seriously creative stuff going on there. Speaking of creative... I selected my lunch from the lobby promo sign. The Bee's Knees is a fried chicken breast with a \"syrupy\" glaze served between two Belgian waffles (see photo below). I had really high expectations, but it ended up being just too sweet. One of my buddies ordered the same sandwich. He and I agreed that it could use a kick of spice. Points for creativity though.

Regardless, the bottomless fries were delicious. Kudos on the new menu Red Robin. I'll have to come back and try one of those new burgers next time."}
{"text":"We take my grandson here all the time but tonight was extremely disappointing. We had Jordan as our server as I am still ordering she keeps looking past us as I talk to her and closes her order book when I wasn't even done. She acted like my grandson and I were keeping her from doing something else. One ice tea and I was done after that she waited until we were all done to ask if I wanted another ice tea. My grandson didn't even touch his apple juice I ask for a to go cup and get nothing. I will re-evaluate my decision on returning to Red Robin after tonight.

I am the customer I worked my 10 hour shift today and everyday if I am tired or not in the mood it's no one else's problem when I am work. I don't project my bad mood onto someone I work with or for when I am at work. That's a work ethic if you don't want to be there don't make your poor choice my problem either call in or check
It at the door because I don't need your bad attitude. It seems like that is the attitude in Las Vegas no work ethic and make the customer feel uncomfortable or make us pay the price because you don't want to be at work or can't put something on the side to do your job."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to review Red Robbin, I mean Red Robin for awhile. My wife and I went in here late one night after waiting about 10 minutes at our table at Mimi's for a waiter. Unfortunately we went over to Red Robin for a very poor tasting $19 per person Burger, drink and fry combo. They have unlimited fries, who cares, the burgers suck."}
{"text":"This is in no way a Handicapped friendly restaurant. It would be impossible for a wheelchair unless previous arrangements for a very front table is made.

 I use a walker, so I was dropped off near door, as there were no handicapped spots available, which is no problem, it is expected many times. When I went in to give hostess name & count in party, we had this strange back & forth discussion. I kept saying 4 plus a high chair, and she would respond with, \"So 5\" and I'd say, no, 4 plus a highchair. So then she would say 4 total & I'd say, plus a highchair. We settled on 5.

When hostess called us, we were walked to the very far back of restaurant & then the hostess expected us to go left to as far back on the other side of restaurant. My daughter immediately told hostess, I would not be able to get thru the next to nothing aisle. So we were turned around to go back the way we had come but a shorter distance to the original table the hostess had planned for us. 

By the time we reached it, I was in severe pain & needed to sit. Amazingly, there were two tables put together just like ours, with a better set up for highchair & my walker to be folded & placed, however, we passed it for the next set up. This set up was awful, especially when it was time to leave because of course, by then other people were sitting at the tables that would have been far better for us. Thus, they had to stand up so I could get out from behind our table.

A suggestion I would give, is for hostess to put the letter H next to the name, trained for it's meaning, as it became obvious none of the 3 hostesses who had watched my coming in with kind guests opening double set of doors, so after training what a walker means & requires, they can then plan accordingly for proper tables. 

However, I doubt anything for the handicapped would be taken into consideration at this popular, so called family restaurant or I guess a handicapped 63 yr old grandmother is not considered family. The tables & chairs are so crammed in to get the higher profit, at the sake of any elderly people struggling to walk in between what looks like a horrible mess.

Before starting a career, I started as a busgirl at Caesar's, I had been a waitress at a Denny's, and the original MGM. My career was a Corporate Meeting & Special Event Coordinator. I found Red Robin a nightmare!"}
{"text":"Typical Red Robin, so not much to say. The rib tips are crappy, but the beer was nice and cold."}
{"text":"Knowing when to use the computer to order or pay is confusing."}
{"text":"Red Robin Burgers Monroeville is at the Monroeville Mall front entrance in front of Monterey Bay and across from Barns and Noble. The have been there a year or two now replacing what was Johnny Carino's. 
This location perhaps like most, is backed up on the weekend evenings, so I usually try to go on weekday evenings and sit in the bar area at a high-top. You could go on the weekend and not to worry too much because they register your cell phone number and send you a text when you are up. This is nice because you can walk across to the book store and browse while you wait. It's a great book store well worth browsing the racks for a half hour. Then before you know it you get that text message that your table is ready. 

The place is new and still really clean. The service is pretty good most of the time; although it can vary depending on how new the server is to the job. 

There are plenty of kids here and they have a great kids menu which is part of what makes a great family place, hence my option to usually dine in the bar side. If you have children I know you and they will have a great time at Red Robin.

I like several of their signature burgers namely the Guacamole Bacon, the Sautéed 'Shroom and the good old Bacon Cheeseburger. You can also 'have it your way and choose all your topping sauces and ingredients which is fun sometimes. The burgers are all quite good. I wish I could order the temperature I wanted but their choices are 'pink or no pink'. I ask for pink, which usually comes out without pink. Don't know if they are avoiding any possible food borne illness which could hurt the chain, but that is my guess. Nonetheless the burgers do retain their juiciness and flavor, so while I may not leave uttering the signature Yummm, I am certainly satisfied enough to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Ok, so I know this is a chain, and well what can be so special about a chain... Well I will tell you.  The turkey burger!  That's what can be so special about a chain.  Seriously, the BEST turkey burger I've ever had is at Red Robin (and trust me, I've had MANY).  If there's a turkey burger on the menu, you can rest assured I will order it, and time and time again, Red Robin is my favorite.  I feel a little ashamed admitting this, since, it is a chain after all.

But seriously, it's so moist and delicious.  No one else can get it right.  It's either tasty and dry or moist and flavor-less, but NOT Red Robin.  It's consistently TASTY and MOIST!  Yes, that's right.  MOIST.  (Should I have given a warning at the beginning of this review that it would be R rated?)

Anyway, if you love turkey burgers as much as I do, get yourself over to a Red Robin pronto, you're welcome. (p.s. get it with cheese, duh)

p.p.s. the reason I knocked it down 1 star is because 1) it's very much a \"family\" restaurant, which means it's inevitably loud, and 2)  although they have great cocktails like spiked strawberry lemonade, the drinks are kinda pricey considering the lack of sufficient booze to drown out the \"loudness\" of the surroundings."}
{"text":"Apparently Red Robin decided to remove the Boca Burger from their menu. As a vegan who use to love going there, I got up and left last night after waiting over 20 min to even be seated, and about another 5 min before the waitress even saw us. They replaced the Boca burger with some quinoa and oats patty, to most likely save a dollar, but it was definitely the wrong decision. I would rather pay a little more and eat a Boca burger than some random thing they tossed together and called a burger. My family will NOT be customers anymore unless they bring the Boca burgers back."}
{"text":"Can I just say that the service was so amazing here! I have never been to a place that was so welcoming. I went here for my pre-graduation dinner. I had the wiskey river burger and some prickly pear lemonade drink, I forget the actual name. It was delicious and also pretty to look at. We had a great time and our server made sure to make us feel at home!"}
{"text":"Great service by Monet our hamburger artist! Clean , friendly. Kid free bar area dining."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to sit down and eat. They have big TV's everywhere and the viewing angles are greats in terms of the food itself, it's not bad. I ordered the California chicken sandwich and it wasn't bad. It was a bit on the messy side however. It came with thick cut fries that honestly were peppered way too much. Lastly, the meal itself didn't fill me whatsoever.

As for our server? She's the reason why I deducted one star. She wasn't too approachable. Didn't make eye contact with us, and she got my and my fiancées drink mixed up more than once. She wasn't the worst waitress, but nevertheless didn't enhance our overall experience. 

In short, we'll go back but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service at a chain restaurant in a long time. You'll get better service at the Cracker Barrel if you're black; it's that bad.  The food is below, or possibly beyond, mediocre.  The ordering and paying method on the tablet is annoying.  I get it, you're trying to appeal to millennials, who are typically just as annoying.  Their secret to an awesome burger?  Slap a bunch of shitty toppings and sauce on a poor quality patty.  Skip it unless nothing else is open; pro tip: something else will always be open."}
{"text":"We eat at red robin a few times a month and this was the worst dinning experience my family has ever had. We ordered drinks that never came. My sons kids order was put in wrong so he got his food last (1 year olds cannot be the last to get their food!!) I request the kids drink twice and never received one for my son. My food came out cold and dry. I ordered the red robin gourmet burger and it came out with a half of tomato slice and a couple specks of lettuce. I sent my burger back and then needed up eating dinner by myself as it took them a half an hour to fix. I asked for my drink refilled and waited twenty minutes to get one. The manager Dave came over and was very dismissive and rude. He said he would come back to check on us to make sure everything was resolved and never came back. To top everything off we get our bill with two burgers we didn't order on it and two kids meals. There was no apology or comp for ruining our evening or messing up all our food, instead a check for 30 dollars more than it should of been for. Dave should not be a manager, he has no interpersonal or conflict resolution skills. We will never return to red robin and it makes me sad as it was one of our favorite family restaurants."}
{"text":"If you have Kristina as a server, please ask for another.. We were there for dinner a night ago and it was HORRIBLE. We are regulars at Robins, but having had her, it was a rush.. I HATE feeling rushed, that's why I rated a 2/5.. Never do I rate lower than a 4, but I had to for this... There was no refills for drinks and several servers that were better than Kris, was more than helpful.. Like she was in a rush to get out .. We wanted a to-go drink, never happened ... So if you plan on going to Robins, ask for another than Kristina... (Smdh)."}
{"text":"Our waiter was new and his first night on his own.  He did great!  The food was awesome and so was the Bailey's Irish Cream shake."}
{"text":"Well I just finished my second meal here in a year. I hadn't been back for several months because it had been so mediocre the first time. I'm sorry to report this time it was just as bad. Overpriced meals of average burgers and limp, cold fries each time. I'm really sorry this is the case here. I've been to many Red Robin's that are not too bad. For a good burger and fries from now on, I'm headed back to Fuddruckers just south of here. Better meals, at half the price."}
{"text":"I don't know why I ever keep giving this restaurant a chance.  I have been seated for ten minutes without a waitress .  Worst service of any Red Robin, even when they are not busy. I will go back to the excellent Red Robin at San Tan Marketplace where they actually care about customer service"}
{"text":"I just don't understand how this place has stayed in business. The prices keep going up (Whiskey River Burger is now $9.59), the burgers get smaller and the food gets worse. 

I can't say the burger is bad it just isn't good. It is mediocre at best and they charge $10 for it. Personally I think it is insane for what they offer. I would rather have a $6 burger at Carls Jr or better yet - and by far - go to Five Guys and get a great burger that makes this place look like McDonalds. 

Unless someone drags me here - last time. Not worth my money."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with a friend to catch up this evening. We were seated immediately and given our water. Everything was going great. Then as time went by we figured out what we wanted to order. We were seated along the edge of the restaurant, but not in a forgotten corner. To my right there was a couple and to my left another group. Both the couple and the group were  being served, however the waitress never once acknowledged my friend and I, not even asking to fill our waters. Several times she came to check on them, walking right past my friend and I in doing so. After almost 45 minutes waiting we decided to go elsewhere. Nobody even acknowledged that we were leaving, though we passed several servers and the host."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite for freckled lemonades and fried zucchini sticks....absolutely delicious... I go here at least once a week but I love it"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, Red Robin's slogan says it all, \"yum\"! You can't really go wrong with anything off their menu from their tower of onion rings, to their burgers, to their milkshakes...never a bad food experience!
I went to this location during lunch time and there wasn't a wait, yea!!! We got seated and served right away. The staff was friendly and efficient, especially with refilling of the beverages. Service was really quick and friendly. The restaurant AND their bathrooms are clean. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and the service was above average for a everyday regular American dining, however the food was a disappointment. I ordered the mushroom burger and not only does it look absolutely gross, the bun was very soggy and mushy. The food prep put tons of mushrooms which spilled all over my plate and the oils have soaked up the buns. It was very difficult to eat. I also ordered a strawberry milkshake that was about $5.00. McDonalds strawberry milkshake that costs a dollar is way better than this one."}
{"text":"This server, Tonya,  \"lost\" my sisters birthday present of a $25 visa gift card that was sitting right next to her on the table.  The waitress kept grabbing things off the table without asking, baskets full of fries and partially eaten burgers, so I no doubt believe she knows exactly where it is. They apparently tore through the trash and could not find it and the best they could do was give her 25% off, and she wasn't even paying for the dinner so she was left with nothing. I hope Tammy gets some sort of punishment for this as we are extremely disappointed and disturbed. I know it's only $25 but that makes it seem that the workers are desperate to steal. I hope that this helps anyone else from losing their possessions or money."}
{"text":"Well its only fair to tell everyone that only a few days after I posted my review I was contacted by Red Robin and they apologized for my bad times in the bar. I should also mention I have dined at Red Robin before (in the actual dining area) and had been given wonderful food and service, so these two visits would not have stopped me from coming. I know Red Robin restaurants can be good, I just wanted to make it known that since the renovation their bar service was lacking, and judging by the nice attitude I got from the woman who contacted me they are in the process of fixing it. Good. That's all I ask for. When I'm in the mood for a burger at a sit down restaurant I'll be sure to come back, but I'll also be sure not to sit in the bar for a while :)"}
{"text":"I always had a good experience at RR with their hamburgers but last night me and my wife decided on their pasta and chicken. Well what a nightmare... We were seated next to the kitchen and could see everything. The cooks were all Mexican guys and couldn't speak English and didn't understand the waiters and couldn't read the order tickets. Just getting the order in took 10 minutes. We saw the pasta coming out of a microwave and they messed it all up and had to remake it. By the time it got to us 35 minites had passed. The food was ice cold and tasted horrible. We walked out."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service, complete with staff miscommunication and general manager's rudeness and unwillingness to resolve any form of issue. Was taken to a dirty table, given dirty water in a glass that had obviously not been washed. Was ignored the entire time I was there, until I was given the check. It also reeks like bathroom sewage... very gross and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Wow. I can't believe people eat this stuff on the regular. 

This was my first time ever at a Red Robin and it was pretty much what I thought it would be... cookie cutter food, mundane vibe, and terrible service. Normally, I save the bad reviews for my second visit, purely to be fair. I mean everyone has a bad day, but I don't ever foresee myself coming back here.

When you're with the parents, sometimes you're just too hung-over to fight for a better place to eat, hello Red Robin. After waiting fifteen minutes for a table into a partly filled dining room, we were escorted to our seats. As we walked past the miles of screaming kids and sad looking overwhelmed parents. I noticed that not only was the place was relatively empty, but the empty tables were covered in dirty plates and old food scraps. Yummy. 

We sat down and were literally passed by three different servers for about ten minutes until finally a served stopped before walking by us and asked if we had been helped, \"No, not yet\", \"oh man, well you're not even my table, so I'll be right back\", wow. He did come back to take our order, but you have to realize at this point we have been in this place for almost twenty five minutes and haven't even received a glass of water. 

The food was a strong meh. I ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter, with a side salad, pre-seasoned bagged frozen food, limp salad, and tons of dressing, because what do you do to mask bad food? Drown it in sauces and salt-based spices. I know this pace is known for it's burgers, but I wasn't feeling it, sorry Red Robin. 

The beer menu also confused me. They have the Stone and I believe Lagunitas logos on their beer menu, but when I asked, what kind of Stone they had on tap, the server said they didn't have any, wait what? It was all Sam Adams and Miller brands, so I ordered Iced Tea. Why add this logo to permanent, laminated alcohol menu and not even have it in stock? 

Beyond the bad service, lack of good beer, and questionable food. Our bill was still pretty pricey, over sixty dollars for three people at chain restaurant? Note-to-self, don't let anyone else choose the lunch spots from now on. 

RED ROBIN... No, Not Yum."}
{"text":"This location is usually not to busy but really slow service. The food is always good though and in the end that is a huge deal. The best thing they ever had on the menu was the ragin cajun chicken sandwich, its no longer on the menu but if you ask for a breaded chicken sandwich with a side of buzz sauce then it's almost the same."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. Stopped by this location yesterday with my kids and ordered the chicken tender salad. After eating a few bites I noticed the chicken was NOT cooked at all. The wItness came by and I showed her and she flinched it was so bad. the manager came over and gave a insincere apology and only took my salad off. Thanks for not charging me for that salad, really appreciate it? Did he offer anything else? Nope!!! Beware... Sooooo dangerous!"}
{"text":"I would be willing to bet that the so called meat in their burgers doesn't even resemble beef.  I don't know what it was..but it was pretty awful.  The texture and flavor was nothing close to ground beef."}
{"text":"I came home for the holidays and my sister and I have been talking about going to Red Robin for weeks. I was so excited to come home and watch a movie with our takeout. We ordered two chicken sandwiches with fries and 2 sides of campfire sauce. We got home and opened up the boxes and saw that there was NO campfire sauce. I am extremely disappointed it's going to take me months to ever walk back in those doors. (Also my sisters bacon was not fully cooked)."}
{"text":"So a few coworkers and I went to Red Robin for dinner tonight around 5. There were ten of us, so I understand some issues but dear Lord. I've never had such terrible service. Our server ignored us 95% of the time we were here. Our food was cold and the broccoli was rubbery. They took an entree off of our tab, but left the other three customers with us paying for food we expressed our displeasure with. That little machine they make us pay with was confusing and instead of assisting us with figuring it out, the server walked by, said 'I see you've figured it out', turned the call server light off and walked away. It was so bad. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We have fallen in love with Red Robin and this locations is one of our go-tos. Usually we sit at the bar, since it's self-seating and the service is quick and friendly. We can also watch all the action on both the TVs and the people watching.  

I've had everything from the Tavern Double to the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and not been disappointed.  We usually share the small onion ring starter as well.  Get the mud pie. Best. Dessert. Ever.

This location also has a lot of shopping options so it makes for a good trip overall if you are looking to spend a little time eating and shopping."}
{"text":"We've been to this location a couple of times now, and wen't again yesterday to meet some friends from my wife's work.  I will say that Red Robin in general puts out consistently good food with relative speed.  This location is no exception.

This time I decided to try their new Colossus burger.  Sweet baby Jesus it was delicious!  Imagine a RR Cheeseburger with BBQ sauce and beef brisket on top--and not the crappy, overcooked brisket a lot of places try to feed you--real, good, juicy brisket, on a juicy burger.  It was most excellent!  Add on their standard amazing steak fries and you've got quite the delicious lunch or dinner.   Or second lunch.  Or second dinner......sorry--went Hobbit there thinking about it.  Needless to say it doesn't take a genious to figure out you shouldn't bother counting calories if you do this.

In case you haven't heard, they are also offering BOTTOMLESS rootbeer floats now.  Soft serve ice cream with barq's rootbeer.  Bottomless, I say!  I'm yet to get through more than one with the meal, but it's worth the $4 price tag in my opinion.

The only downside to this visit was our waitress was a bit moody, but for all I know she could have been having a bad day.  She was a little nicer around the time she was handing us the check.  I'll reserve judgment for now and give her the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Day after Christmas stores were overloaded with people looking for bargains, going to the movies, and eating out. We fell in the later category. Lucky, we found a parking space close to the restaurant. At home Red Robin is our go-to sit-down restaurant for burgers. 

Inside was packed, with no waiting in the pub. For two people the pub was perfect. The waitress appeared almost the moment we sat down. Ordered. Food came quick, hot ... happy to satisfy growing hunger pains. 

Hubby ordered Chicken salad. No surprises.  My fish and steak fries satisfied. 

At the table sat a computerized screen for paying the bill. LOVE it. Not only could we pay (with auto calculating tip meter), we used it to call the waitress for more salad dressing. No more hailing down harried wait staff. LOVE IT! And, before leaving, we answered a pretty lengthy online review, something I probably wouldn't have taken time for once I got home.

Nice to find reliable sources miles from home."}
{"text":"Tonight was our daughters 4 year birthday, so her mom asked her where she wanted to go and she said to her favorite place, Red Robin. We hadn't been to the downtown Summerlin location so we decided to give it a try. We were seated and our server Tabitha took our drink order and we told her that it was our daughters 4 year birthday. She said that she had a birthday sundae for her at the end of the dinner. When the sodas came out, I could tell that they were flat before she even set the tray down on the table. I said \"It looks like your soda is flat\". Without skipping a beat she said \"No not at all,it is fine\" and then rushed off to deliver the rest of the drinks on her table. Not being convinced, I took one drink and confirmed that it was flat and gross tasting. As I was waiting for her to get close enough to flag down, I took a closer look at the glass of soda and there wasn't one bubble in the thing. Anyone that was paying half attention could have easily seen that it was flat when they were pouring it. I flagged her down and asked her to bring out an iced tea instead. We eventually ordered our food and it came out on-time. When she came back to check on us she asked my daughters mom if she wanted a drink re-fill. My iced tea was sitting in front of my plate of food (90% empty) while her glass was off to the right at the edge of the table. I then began to notice that this girl is not paying attention to anything. She didn't ask if I wanted a refill because my glass wasn't in her line of sight. When she brought the drink refill I waited for her to check on my drink, which I pushed closer to the edge, but that didn't even get her attention.

     So given that great demonstration of anticipating your guest's needs, I was eating my dinner without anything to drink when out of the blue Tabitha re-appeared with some other servers to sing happy birthday to our daughter. They sang the song and she plopped an ice cream sundae down like she was Santa Claus delivering the presents on Christmas Eve. My daughter's mom and I just looked at each other. We weren't even half finished with our dinner and my daughter was still eating the first half of her toasted cheese sandwich. I put the ice cream sundae back on her tray and said \"Put that in the freezer please and bring me a drink refill\". \"We still have to eat our dinner first\" She looked confused and once again I could tell that she wasn't paying attention to anything about our dining experience. We ate our food, paid the bill and got out of there. 

     One thing to remember, is that I could see the open kitchen and the female manager was cooking along side of the employees in the back, Her time would have been better served by being in the dining room and observing the lack of effort that was going on there. After crap service like that, I usually don't come back. I might give them another try, but it's not on my list of things to do anytime soon."}
{"text":"This location has extremely slow service including dining in as well as making a call to pick up an order. On hold two different times to make a telephone order the first time was 5 minutes hung up and called back and decided to take our business else where and this is the second time that this has happened.  Dining in they seemed to be short staffed on servers even though they had two hostesses standing at the front and the new system with pressing the button to ask for your server is completely ineffective! Would have given 1 star except for the fact that the food is still ok"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times, just wanted to leave a 5* review for the bartender/server named Mary. She's usually here whenever I come in, and besides recognizing me, always has a great attitude and is prompt with the refills and remembers what I ordered before, even if I don't. Ok maybe she gets that wrong but she is so sweet about it I usually say something like not this time."}
{"text":"Here is our welcome to Red Robin: 

John, the manager asked another customer standing near our group if she was with us. One of our guests replied, \"she is too young\". John the manager made a comment to our guest that he was \"showing his age.\"  It just seemed inappropriate to be scolded on the way in to dinner.


One of our guests asked, if the thousand island dressing was Gluten Free the person said they would check and never came back. We had to get up and get a waiter's attention and ask.

Cook on the burger was perfect.

Avocobo was good.

Fish nugget was served on the veggie burger...WT? The guest who was eating the veggie burger has severe reactions to fish. 

Asked for a second basket of sweet potato fries....waited....waited...maybe 30 min later.

Asked to talk to the manager about the fish nugget.....still waiting....its been 15 minutes...he's coming now. 

\"What seems to be the issue?\"

Really? Now were having issues? How about, \"How may I help you?\"
OMG! He did not let us explain. He kept talking over. He needs to learn how to talk to guests with some humility, and quit the arrogant self important attitude.

This fish could put her in the hospital....and he did not give a shit. He just wanted to say sorry and make us shut up."}
{"text":"After an unfortunate experience at this location, I posted a review detailing the problems with my experience. The management reached out to me trying to smooth over the situation. Gave them one more shot and had a much better experience. Not perfect, but I'll probably be back again because of the good customer service."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and service was great. Christian was very attentive and our order was exactly what we ordered. Will definitely recommend to as a place to have a great meal with the entire family."}
{"text":"We just love the newer menu! The peppercorn hamburger was the bomb! We hit at happy hour and the staff was wonderful to us all ."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Red Robin.  I usually get the clicks and shrimp which I absolutely love but this time I went with a bunch of friends and wanted to try something new so I got a Red Robin burger it was pretty simple small the bun was not very good quality more like a value bun. Let's just say I will be sticking with my clucks and shrimp. I had a margarita it was very very good we sat at the bar it was pretty busy we where gonna have to wait 30 mins but sat at the bar instead and had no wait. The lady at the bar was very nice greeted us got our order very quickly the laddies brought it out within 25 mins . Everyone I was with liked the food was not the greatest definitely could have been better. Will definitely go back and will definitely stick with the usual ."}
{"text":"First time here today. Food and service were mediocre at best. Overpriced food for the quality of the ingredients. The floor beneath our booth was sticky and dirty plus waitress kept messing up our order. Probably won't be back since you can get better service and quality ingredients from In n out or 5 guys for half the price."}
{"text":"Well just had to share , went here today , it's something each one of my family member and I can eat , not so easy with my family , game day of course . Well here the problem , 
We order , took forever to get our food we seriously sat and sat , we sat and watch 3 tables leave ,and one got  served before our food ever came , the ones that got their food before us ordered way after us. Not really sure what happen , but our poor waiter blamed it on my boca patty taking longest from the rest  of The order , the thing is we go here a lot and I always order the boca patty and it really never takes longer than any other burger or chicken sandwich .
So waiting 45 min to get our order that was a bit long , 
So now telling you the best part , Paul our sever was indeed keeping us posted , brought us out fries to keep us happy , refilled our drinks , try to explain it to us , was extremely helpful , even at the end brought us a slice of ice cream cake as his way of apologizing , he went out of his way ,thank you so much , server of the year from us,. PAUL ,I would think the manager would come out and apologize but no , never came up to us , never said he was sorry , no nothing . Didn't even see him . 
So next time you need a great server, one who will treat you well , keep you laughing , ask for Paul,  the manager can take notes on him ..would have giving it a 5 star if food didn't take forever , but paul should get the 5 stars , he rocks ."}
{"text":"I like going to Red Robin; however, I do not particularly like the one located at the Tempe Marketplace.  My boyfriend and I decided to eat dinner there last Sunday night.  We were pretty hungry and we thought that Red Robin would hit the spot.  I was looking forward to the Salmon Burger.  

We were seated immediately in a booth.  We looked through the menu and decided what we wanted to eat.  After five minutes, no one came to greet us.  Waitresses kept walking by, but no one stopped to say hi or get our drink order.  We waited five more minutes, by that time we were looking around to see if we had a waitress.  Still no one...we decided to leave and go to In-N-Out Burger.  I was really looking forward to a Salmon Burger, but I don't like bad service much less no service.  The location was not busy at all and there was no reason from my end why someone couldn't come up to us and let us know what was going on.  Those other waitresses passed by us and even looked right at us.  They knew we weren't getting served.  They could have possibly kept me there if they acknowledged that we were there and would locate our waiter/waitress.  I know this is one incident, but it really puts a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"They did something different with their salads, they give you a salad on a tiny plate, not mixed and a slab of grilled chicken breast. Not happy about it, I tried to mix my salad and it kept falling off my plate."}
{"text":"Came here with hubs while shopping,  the pretzel bites are nice and soft but the cheese dip is not so yummy... The chili is amazing and has enough kick to the tongue but doesn't roundhouse your face. I had the Mac and cheese which was really good, hubs had a burger which was great but he wished that our waitress asked how he wanted it, came out fine just the same. And the milkshakes are amazing! Get the monster size (fills your glass twice, massive portion)! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"For a restaurant that specializes in hamburgers I expected there burgers to be better than other places.  I had the Royal Red Robin and fries.  The burger was just average (not bad), and the fries came in a bottomless metal cup that looked pathetic.  There's more fries in a small order at McDonalds then what was in this cup.  Even though you do get an endless amount of fries, they can bring more than 8 stubby ones that didn't even reach the top of the cup. 
The service and atmosphere was good, but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"When you're reviewing a franchise there isn't much you can say differently then the rest of them. This location is fine, I have never had a problem with Red Robin. Food is always decent, service is always good. Always enjoyed their grill chicken salad. Burgers is never a bad option."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes before a server approached us. Ordered appetizers 15 minutes ago and our server has been \"chatting\" with the table next to us the entire time. Hasn't checked on us once. Our server, Kwarma, is horrible. One of the hostesses asked him to check on our appetizers."}
{"text":"I had the arctic cod and it should have been a bit crisper. The fries were not as crisp as they should be when properly cooked. My hubby said his jalapeno burger was not very tasty as their meat is not high quality. The manager recommended eating the black angus burger, next time. If they are known for burgers, then all of the burger meat should be real high quality and more of it on each burger. The fried jalapenos were soggy on the burger. I think the fry cooks need some more schooling on the proper use of the fryer and even cooking temps."}
{"text":"Waited at the front for 5 minutes 
Not a worker in sight
Sat ourselves at the bar area and after 10 minutes a waitress finally came by.
Took our drink order and we didn't see her again for a while. We are literally the only people in the bar. We can see into the kitchen and about 15 workers are having fun and messing around and some kids run back there and it's a giant cluster of mismanaged employees.

Corporate needs to see this crap!

At one point 6 waiters/waitresses were eating together as we sat waiting for service. Three walked out of the kitchen chewing as they carried food plates. This is completely unsanitary and disgusting! Then one lady customer with her two daughters in pajama dresses who obviously knew the staff goes back into the kitchen with her two kids and they walk out with two big bags of boxed food containers. We just paid $35 for our dinner only to watch employees and their friends be catered to for free. 
Last I checked kids in pajamas and slippers aren't supposed to be around the food/kitchen area other patrons are buying!

So as everyone is ignoring customers or eating the attached picture shows how disgusting the kitchen area looks that's visible from where we sat for our dinner. 
This place should be inspected ASAP!"}
{"text":"This red robin is very unorganized, I went the other day with some friends and they seemed understaffed that night. I get it, I use to work in the restaurant business s I tried to cut them some slack and be patient. We got seated by the host then I think a manager got our drinks and then our server got our order. She didn't even greet us she just took the order and left. The restaurant wasn't clean at all times there was food all over the floor when we got there and it was still there when we left. Food took about 30 minutes to get and we hardly saw our server. Save yourself a trip and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I have lived in CO. I worked down the road from \"THE CORP\" Red Robin. I started eating there in Silverlake, WA when I was in the Navy in 1996. Been a customer for a very long time.  Red Robin has lost it's way.

In Charlotte there are 3 and none of them are up to par. The one we went to last night is a train wreck. Even after getting the manager to come out. She was busy in the back doing inventory while her staff was busy watching the game on TV. There were at least a dozen dirty tables in the middle of the restaurant. All of them had trash under them and were in no state to be used by anyone. There was a piece of paper from a straw next to our table that just about every server stepped on but never picked up. Even after I made eye contact and looked at the paper they server still stepped over it. They were very busy breaking down the bar area and cleaning the things they could vs. taking care of the actual customers who were there. Only about a dozen customers in the store at the time and no one was getting taken care of.

After getting the manager to come out she offered nothing to make up for the situation. You all need help in NC. All of the Red Robin's here are crap and the only reason we were there was because I had a gift card. I will not be giving you my money for a long time. You also might want to fix that menu. It's a freaking train wreck too. Way too long and way too complicated. There is no flavor to anything either. It's just boring."}
{"text":"Daughter and I decided to have dinner together, knowing this is one of her favorite place to eat. I figured this would have been her choice! I never really had a favorite dish at red robin, even though I do enjoy trying their variety of hamburgers! But I have been noticing that I have been ordering their fried chicken salad lately! I truly enjoy this plate, now of course it must have honey mustard dressing! Daughter had the same thing but with ranch, and we shared an order of fries with no salt! First time in a long time I really enjoyed having dinner with her, no i-phone!! Pet peeve of mine! If you are going to spend some time with someone! Stay of the F-n phone!!! You can text them later!!! There! Got it off my chest!!! Let's get back to Red Robin, great place to hang out, has a nice bar area, and good service!"}
{"text":"Management gave me a call today, apologizes, and said they have taken steps to cure the issues. That is a great thing when a restaurants can admit they have an problem and his taking steps to get better. They were very sincere and apologetic. For this reason alone I will be adding a star to their rating."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a good burger, or at least a burger that is not from a drive thru window. Red Robin might be one of those places you consider then this urge strikes. Their menu has a wide variety of burgers and sandwiches they also have a few pages of burgers that are not spectacular or gourmet-ed up and are a reasonable price. I have found very few places that have a burger that is good enough for me to pay over $12 for it. Sure you can put bacon, avocado, three kinds of cheese, different sauces, mushrooms, olives and a host of other things on top and bottom.  And make it so big that I cannot take a bite out of it without spilling out as much as I get in my mouth and using a handful of napkins before I finish the thing.  There is something to be said for these gigantic slabs of meat and condiments. But, a simple, cheese, bacon, onion, mustard and pickles, burger, with well seasoned meat, cooked just right on a roll that is big enough and of a texture that complements the burger is the way I usually like to go. Red Robin does a good job of this and you get all the fries you can eat all for $6-7. Service is usually good, I have had good and less than good at this site. Servers are friendly.  Food quality is consistent. Inside is a bit cleaner than outside. Seems like most restaurants that have an outdoor section have tables that are unbalanced, are a bit dirty, uncomfortable chairs and usually have at least one table where the people are too loud or talking on their phones loud enough to everyone to hear.  Anyway, when I want a burger that I know will satisfy my \"burger want\", I can count on Red Robin."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre, waited 15 min for the server to come by our table. Then the food took another 20 minutes and came out warm, not hot. We ordered the clucks and they came out with soggy breading. 

We have been to the location on Eastern and it is way better. This location in the mall is mall quality, I guess. I could have had better food and service at the pretzel stand. 

Very disappointing visit, and this is the 2nd time my wife has been here, both times with the same results. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Red Robin is THE place to go to for a quick, delicious lunch in an upbeat atmosphere. I simply adore the CA Chicken Burger...oh gosh, it is so yummy! They also have a great Asian Chicken Salad that is cool and filling on a hot summer day. 

This location (like the rest no matter WHAT state you are in) is loud and the service at times, not the best. So if you are looking for a quiet place to enjoy a burger...this would not be the best choice. But in all honesty, after dining at this establishment for the past 18 years, I have to say that the food keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"This location doesn't really seem to like you to come here, it feels like you have bothered them when you check in. The kitchen is incredibly sloooow, and everyone may not get their order at the same time! And when I got home, I realized I had cleaned their booth seat for them, there were three or four smudges of crud across the hem of my new cream blouse. So if you still think you want to go there be sure to wear black! BTW I have enjoyed Red Robin at other locations, this one needs someone to get control."}
{"text":"Great place to get good burgers! Their Oktoberfest Burger and pumpkin spice shake are awesome seasonal dishes! 
Got a free burger for my birthday from their Club,  which really made my day!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  The waitress (chelsea) was one of the best waitresses my husband and I have had in the last couple years.  Very quick about refills and helping us with our questions about ingredients.  The food was great too!"}
{"text":"AWESOME!! I haven't ate at Red Robin in years & I forgot what I was missing.  The classic cheeseburger was great & the bottomless fries can't be beat.  YaYa is a great server, friendly, & very attentive to her customers.  Great dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Eh. 

Red Robin is one of those places you go to as an adult to grab a beer and burger without thinking about it.  We went over the weekend for our first Red Robin experience and was pleasantly surprised to see how crowded it was.  I assumed that, based on the number of seats taken that it would be a great place to eat a burger.  I also noticed that majority of the patrons were families with small children, so the whole beer and burger thing may be a tad of a stretch, at least for the crowd I saw.

We ordered the classic with cheese and some steak fries, a mint shake and one soda.  The shake comes with the mixer container still half full, which was nice for the five dollar price tag, and was a fairly good shake.  Standard, nothing mind blowing or amazing, but good.  The burgers came out really fast, and I was happy with the short wait.  They were wrapped in wax paper and came in baskets, which was nostalgic.  To top it off, they were huge!  I couldn't wrap my mouth around one, for some reason.  Still, once I took the first bite I was satisfied but not pleased.  I expected their burgers to somehow be different, more authentic or genuine in taste, but I didn't get that.  Although a good burger, I could get the same one for less somewhere else.  Overall, good burger and fries (especially since they are endless refills), but nothing that I'd go back for.

Great service, good burger and shakes, and fun little games in the lobby.  Hey--those kids were ga ga over the burgers, so I guess they're doing something worth while.  For me, personally, it was okay but I won't be back."}
{"text":"only two stars cuz the food tasted good. i had the bonzai, which is ok. i think the carls jr. teriyaki burger tastes better though. my bf got a royal red robin and it was ok for him too. we also had some coleslaw and mac n' cheese but they never brought out napkins and utensils. we asked for some and we got napkins but the guy said the utensils were being washed. we thought that was weird but w/e. halfway through our meal and we still didnt get it. when we finished, we sat around for probably 10 minutes before we were noticed. they gave us to go boxes for our stuff and asked if we needed our check but we waited another while before we got it... maybe the staff has memory issues or something... our server came by and asked us how we were doing and i mentioned that we never got our utensils so she apologized and told her manager. the manager ended up comping the whole meal so we didn't have to pay at all. i'd prolly go to red robin again, just not this location..."}
{"text":"I love eating here.  Endless fries and honey mustard? Count me in."}
{"text":"Service is lacking but the food is okay. I wouldn't be seen frequently here, for sure."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, food good but not correct. Valerie is super nice"}
{"text":"This place has its ups and downs. For a chain the burgers are generally very good, and the steak fries are tasty with the house seasoned salt. If I could I would always get a burger to go, though, as the dining room is full of loud little kids and tacky crap hanging all over the walls."}
{"text":"The new revisions are ridiculous. The tabletop kiosk is a trap. They have games on it. We touched it by accident and there was an automatic charge of $2. An entertainment fee...
The salad my sister used to order has shrunk significantly.  It's even called something different.  The waiter said it was just like the chicken salad she used to order. Hhmm...not even close.. 
When my sister complained the manager came out and literally spent 10 min. trying to convince her it is the same salad as before. My neice ordered the meatballs that were hard as a rock.  She had part of one and couldn't eat the rest. She had a stomach ache that lasted all night. 
Oh...be careful with the 'table top payment' . If you aren't careful you will pay the full 20 % for the service. We didn't come to Red Robin to deal with more technology.  
WE WILL NEVER GO AGAIN! WE WERE REGULARS!
Since Yelp can be hired for good reviews you may not see the true depth of how bad it is. Don't waste your money..."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner around 8 PM and was surprised that there was a full house plus a lot of people waiting. For my party of 2, it was about 20 minutes. They take down your number and text you when your table is ready so you can leave if you'd like. It was cold out so we stayed in the waiting area. I liked that there was plenty of seating and a chalkboard for kids (and adults) to draw on. 

The host, Jorge was running around bussing tables and seating customers. Although he was super busy, he was very nice and helpful. We were seated in a booth in the bar area. Our server was the bartender so she wasn't as attentive as I'd like. Understandable though as she had to make all the drinks and serve people at the bar.... but there were only 4 people at the bar and her other table already got their check. Service was pretty slow but she was nice enough. Our food took over 35 minutes to come out and it wasn't hot.... Not sure how long it sat on the window but someone should have ran it out for the bartender. 

I ordered the whisky bbq burger and it was pretty good. Cooked medium, just as requested. I did wish that the cheese was melted though. The cheddar cheese on the burger wasn't even slightly melted at all and it was lacking in veggies. Other than that, if you love bbq, I'd highly recommend it. Fries were also cold but I love their unlimited steak fries regardless! 

Not the worst experience I've had at a Red Robin but not the best either. I'll probably ask to sit in the regular dining area next time or sit directly at the bar to get better service."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was hoping things were better.  After we ordered our food we waited so long they brought out fries for us to snack on. After 30 minutes we finally got the food. It was good for most but the burger was cold. Basically they left the burger in the window after waiting for the rest of the food.  Which Is strange as the other food was just fried and shrimp. We told the server and she was great tried so hard to make it better and then sent the waste of space manager over who was so ackward at the table.   If you come here it is slow but remember it's not the servers it the back of the house which is the problem which is a reflection of the issues which fall within the management."}
{"text":"The burgers at red robin are above average. They would rate higher if the service could rise above the chain mentality of another customer means more work. 
Maybe it's that I've always eaten aim the bar  area. But service always seem somewhat distracted by something else."}
{"text":"Hello we went there tonight  it was busy so there was a 20 minute wait no problem we was seated right away the waitress came over took our order but in between hit and miss service we had to ask how long our meal was she said 20 minutes it felt like 30 she bought French fries to kill the wait  when our meal came out my try's was warm not hot had to ask for my bottomless drink so not a happy camper more like a boat in the middle of the lake"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate because our server was so nice & I would give her 5 starts! (Tara) buttttt... the hostess was so rude and wanted to just get us seated and over with ... the food was eh! My burger was cold and my boyfriend asked for crispy bacon and it came out soggy. Tara got us new bacon but it looked so cheep we wouldn't touch it. Definitely not gourmet burgers."}
{"text":"Normally, I do not go to this Red Robin location, and for good reason. This experience at this Red Robin were nowhere near meeting expectations. I had a 6-top and the other guests on my cheque complained that their hamburgers were cold, the pop was not fresh and it was not worth the money at all. I don't think I'll return to this Red Robin location anytime soon, and to any Red Robin (at least) for the next couple of months.  Plus, it get's better; I didn't even make it out of the parking lot when I started feeling sick. Great."}
{"text":"All I can say is... UGH! I decided to try Red Robin because I had a $10 gift card. Before I decide to either dine in or take out, I decided to order to go to make sure if this is my kind of restaurant. I called and ordered the Turkey Burger with Steak Fries on the phone and only had to wait 6 minutes which wasn't bad since I was around the corner.

As I went in to Red Robin, the staff was talking to each other and tried to image if I was not there. So I waited until their conversation was finished. I was greeted, payed for my take out, and took the food home.

The Turkey Burger was ok. A little burger so small that had little veggies, small turkey burger, and buns. Guess how much it was? $10.80! Plus with the steak fries, it was soggy and not enough fried.

Go eat somewhere else. This restaurant isn't worth your time and not worth your money."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my daughter and 4 year old grandson. We arrived at 11:30 and were seated promptly. The server was polite and got the order right. The restaurant is clean with Red Robin kitschy decor. Parking is plentiful and close to the door.

The food: I had the soup and sandwich ($10.99). I had the chicken tortilla soup. Flavorful, but served barely warm (hot soup would have been nice). The sandwich was a Caesar chicken wrap. OK, but I was still hungry after I ate it. My daughter had a cheeseburger with steak fries. She said it was OK. My grandson had the kid's meal cheeseburger, apple slices, and lemonade. He ate it, but did not seem enthusiastic about it. 

As we left, my daughter bought some gift cards for a friend. They have a special where you get a $5 gift card if buy a certain amount of gift cards. They forgot to give her the $5 reward card, and she had to ask for it. You don't get them from the server or the seating hostess (even though the kiosk for them is right next to the seating hostess). You have to go to the bar to get the gift cards and children are not allowed in that area. If I had not been there to watch the 4 month old and 4 year old grandchildren, she would have had to pass on buying her friend the gift cards. Crazy how that works."}
{"text":"Quite frankly this is an over priced average burger joint. They have bottomless fries and drinks but how many drinks do you need. I have never been impressed with red robin."}
{"text":"Horrible. Simple order they couldn't get right. Endless fries to begin with,very small portion,  only ask if I wanted more when I was finished, ordered soup no soup. Order Swiss cheese, receive provolone,  extra onions no extra onions."}
{"text":"This place has a diner/restaurant feel. Lots of decorations on the walls. We were greeted promptly and shown to a table. We sat in a half booth half table. Ok. Well the lighting in her is SO poor we could hardly read the menu. I have to say as a former server, I HATE THE TABLE TOP SELF ORDERING! Why would you want to take money out of your servers pockets??? Ok maybe on a Friday or Saturday night it might be helpful to those in a rush but as soon as I see one of those, I know service will be subpar. Thankfully it was a week day and we came in for lunch. After using my cell phone for light I ordered a wedgie burger. Service was adequate and our order was placed. The fried pickles were so over breaded so much that you could hardly taste the  dill. I ordered my burger rate and it came out medium well, thin little party. It's an ok place for burgers but if your expecting gourmet burgers, this is not your place."}
{"text":"Visited this location on November 18th around 9/930 pm. Sat quickly in the bar, server was nice could have checked up on us a little more frequently but he wasn't bad.
Ordered the Mad Love and the new Veggie Burger.
Mad Love was amazing, Fries were cold. But the refills we got were very hot and delicious.
The reason for the 2 stars was because of the Veggie Burger. The new patty offered is amazing, overall Burger is delicious exploding with flavor brought by the bruschetta salsa and other spread. It also had fried mushroom chips. The problem was that one of the mushroom chips... was in fact a piece of chicken. Not sure how it happened. But for those who don't eat meat, kind of upsetting finding a piece of chicken on your veggie burger.
Brought it up to the server, who responded with something along the lines of \"oh dang, I'm sorry. You think that's bad? I have another story for you after you guys are done eating\""}
{"text":"My boss loves this place, but I find it boring and cliche.

Nothing inspired on the menu, boring and bland burgers. The place reminds me of Chotchkie's in office space. Just white bread and mayonnaise. It's the Olive Garden of burger joints."}
{"text":"My family went out to celebrate my daughter's birthday. We had a party of 9. The wait was longer than we were told it would be. However when we were seated and served  things got better. The wait staff was friendly and offered suggestions. The food came out hot and fresh. The waitress suggested a sweet/spicy sauce that went great with my sweet potato fries. The variety of burgers was a little overwhelming but the waitress was there with assistance.  My kids loved the endless fries and the root beer shakes. We had a enjoyable evening and will return!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of chains but the place I wanted to go was closed on Black Friday. I settled on this and was severely disappointed - we were not greeted when we walked in or after we were seated. The staff seemed significantly preoccupied.  Food was good but I felt like an afterthought. I conveniently got a survey  on my receipt and figured I would tell them privately how terrible the service was but - there was an error on the last page - shocking. 

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We did a pick up order today. I have to say, Red Robin used to be a favorite but has really done down hill. The buns were soggy, my burger was supposed to be \"some pink\" but was more like a hockey puck (super well done). I ordered extra crispy fries but there was no seasoning on them and several of them were burnt....which is sad because that's never been a problem before. My husband got a Royal Burger and he said it was ok but felt like they must be using cheaper ingredients....I'm gonna have to agree. I think we'll just go to one of the breweries around here....it's a couple bucks more expensive but it definitely tastes better.

Sorry Red Robin, we won't be back. Too bad."}
{"text":"The food came out fast and was delish. Drinks were strong and server was very nice."}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying the food is great.  The restaurant itself is good as this kind of place can be. Great menu selection and food comes out timely and well prepared. The reason for my 3 star is because of one waitress that we unfortunately have had several run ins with there. i cannot remember her name, but she should be fired.  She is an absolute misery of a server and needs to find a new line of work.  She is nasty and if you need something like a fork or a straw for your drink she is no where to be found.  When you ask her for something its like you are asking her to swallow broken glass.  I have never \"stiffed\" a server in my life as I know what it is like to be in service but the last time we ate there she got exactly what she deserved.  We actually have not gone to eat there because we dont want another run in with her, but if she was not there we would go back.  May try again to see if she is there and will request to not be in her section is she is.

Edit: So we tried it again last night after my review...and its worse.  The waitress wasnt there but oh my how the food has turned!  They used to have great burgers but now they barely pass as food!  We ordered our burgers medium and they came out like hockey pucks!  Absolutely terrible!  But thats not the worst...later that evening I woke with horrible stomach pain that led to sudden rush to the toilet.  Food poisoning.  I know it was what I ate there because I had not eaten at all that day. Beware!"}
{"text":"This Red Robin is absolutely the worst. It's not even the food! The service is ALWAYS terrible! The hostesses are always welcoming and nice and friendly, but the servers are awful. They never listen to what I order. I always order sweet potato fries when I get a bottomless side- and whenever I ask for more, they always bring back regular fries and cop an attitude with me when I remind them that I had sweet potato fries (even when I've already told them what I wanted when I requested my refill). Refills on drinks are always an issue, too. You'd be better off pacing yourself with your first beverage because you're unlikely to get a second regardless of how many times you ask for one, and you can bet that if you get a second drink, it won't even be anything close to what you ordered. Don't expect your service to be quick, either. It usually takes an hour for a salad with grilled chicken to come out to you. I keep giving this place a chance because RR is special to me and my husband, but this location is just not living up to expectations. No matter how many surveys I do when I do decide to give them a chance, nothing changes and I just get invitation emails to take more surveys."}
{"text":"My son is very choosy or shall we say fussy.  He should do his own yelp since he gave Andre's a 6/10, Studio B buffet a 6/10.  But he's in H.S. with a very busy social calendar.  So I compile our overall impressions herewith.  He was pleased with his $12.99 french dip that came w/ garlic fries.  The parental units had a $9.79 jamaican jerk chix burger & a $9.59 bacon burger.  Both came with the fat steak fries.  All was ok.  That's why it's 4 not 3."}
{"text":"MEGHAN BL she was fantastic top of everything checking up on my kids and my husband too see if we where good & food was BOOMBB!!! Couldn't ask for anyone but her to server us next time we VISIT HENDERSON :)"}
{"text":"Awful. Absolutely clueless. Should have looked at Yelp first. 

First indication was straw wrappers and other small trash on the floor in the bar. 

Waitress was either overwhelmed or in the wrong line of work. 

Ordered two shakes and four waters. Got two shakes and only two waters after a fairly long wait. 

Ordered fried pickles. The were never ordered. 

Ordered a beer.  Never ordered and did not come. 

Burgers arrived. Bland. Undercooked bacon. Just not very good food. 

Fries were lame. Burger and fries place should have great fries. Ours were bad. 

Just such a bad experience. Won't ever go back. 

I broke my own rule and ate at a shitty chain restaurant. Dumb.  

Bad!"}
{"text":"The to go is a joke. We got there at 6:22 and no one helped us until 6:38. It was awful! Also I ordered a side of fries and got like 8 fries the container was not even full and there was no lid on the container. Worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"We were seated fast but the hostess seemed like she hated being there. Our server/bartender was nice and got to us fast and also got our order and drinks in fast. We got the poutine for an appetizer and the fries were cold even the table next to us sent their fries back bc they were cold. We kept quiet though. When our meals came the food just didn't look \"great\", it wasn't like it was the first month they opened when we first ate here, (it was so damn good that time). Our meals arrived our fries were cold and dry. So we finally said something to our server. (We know it's not her fault our food was cold). Either one of us finished our burgers they were nothing special the bun was dry like it was old and burger lacked any kind of flavor. 5 guys burgers are way better. The reason I'm writing this review is bc Red Robin was the only thing I ate today and now I'm doubled over with stomach pain and feel so sick. Something is clearly going wrong in the kitchen and the management should take these reviews seriously bc I'm not the first to complain about feeling sick after dining with your restaurant. 
Sincerely, 
A concerned guest."}
{"text":"The service is slow. The portion sizes are small and way over priced. Red Robin used to be good. Not anymore."}
{"text":"The burger are very tasty and very different .chicken burgers are having very juicy chicken .

Definitely my fav"}
{"text":"Excellent very inexpensive place to take the family for dinner. Love the bottomless fries!!!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant!! Love the loyalty program. My son loves fries. Red Robin has all you can eat fries. Which make him very very happy."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch, and it was fantastic.  The service was quick and friendly, and I was able to get back to work within an hour.  I sat at the bar and had a burger and bottomless fries.  I always love to try the different dipping sauces.  My favorite is the campfire sauce.  This will become a repeat in my lunch locations."}
{"text":"I used to go to Red Robin 2-3 times a month, now I go maybe once a year because of their crappy service, increase in prices, and lower quality of food. So disappointed. Over the years they keep increasing prices and giving less food/lower quality. A few weeks ago I decided to just do a to go order and I completely regretted it. I ordered clucks and fries and an extra basket of fries to go. When I arrived I called the number on the sign to let them know I was there and no one picked up. Tried twice, so I finally called the main number to the restaurant. It took awhile to get help and finally when the food did come out 10 minutes after the estimated time, there was not extra fries and the clucks were tiny in comparison to what they used to be and I could tell they had been sitting out for a while because they were cold and crispy. It was over $12 for that measly amount of food. I can go to Chick Fil A or Canes and get fresh food and great friendly services for less than $10 and that includes a drink. No thanks, Red Robin. No thanks. I'm done."}
{"text":"ordered the whiskey river bbq burger... looked nothing like the picture! was pretty disappointed for i assumed that by going to red robin, id be getting a gourmet burger! however, i would have rather had a burger from in n out, even burger king! the restaurant decor was nice and gave a pulp fiction like feel when uma thurman had her $5 shake + burger. hopefully this place can step up their game if they want to stay in business longer! 
tips to the cook:: 
my buns couldve been buttered up ans toasted, i didnt see 1 onion string on the burger as to seeing lots on the pic."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and it was really busy. We were sat at a table, which I hate, so I asked the host if we could wait for a booth. He didn't even hesitate and told us it would just be a ten or so minute wait. It ended up being about five! He was a great host - very friendly and personable. Our order was taken promptly, food arrived quickly, staff was great, overall I was really happy since the last trip I took to Red Robin (elsewhere) was terrible. 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered curbside to go. I got the siracha burger & he got the ghost pepper. We made the mistake of not double checking our order before leaving. Do not be like us. Double check. Triple check. 


My burger was ordered with lettuce instead of a bun. When I opened the container it was literally JUST TWO PIECES OF MEAT WEDGED BETWEEN LETTUCE. I'm being literal. No onions, tomatoes, siracha onion straws, no pickles. Nothing. Two pieces of meat and some lettuce. What the heck? My boyfriends ghost burger 1) had tomato despite being ordered without and 2) had no ghost pepper sauce?!? 


I called to talk to a manager because I've never encountered such a messed up order. He apologized, kind of. He mostly said how he didn't know how that would've happened. He also said he would refund $6 which, imo wasn't enough but I appreciated it anyway. Here's why I'm writing my review.... not only was our order ridiculously messed up and a HUGE waste of money... we were charged in full. Yep, they never actually took anything off of the tab. 


Normally Red Robin is consistent quality but wow save your money and grab a burger from In & Out instead!"}
{"text":"I always love coming here, and ordering the same thing. But this time around, we decided to order the Just-in Quesadillas, for starters, and they are really good for a place that is known for their burgers. I did order the Banzai Burger, like I always do, as well as a Baily Irish Cream shake and a coke. I love pineapples, so the pineapples on the Banzai burger is always a plus, it just gives that fruity twist to a burger. The Baily's Irish Cream shake is always good, I usually finish that, before I even get my burger. Since I usually finish my shake before the food gets there, then ordering a coke is always a good thing, since you get free refills on coke. 

The place itself is very spacious, and I like that you can move around, with out hitting a table or some one. The staff was really nice and right there, when your ready to take your order. Also I like the fact that they come around to check on you, to see if you need refills on drinks or fries. 

If you love burgers with a twist, this is one of those places I would recommend. I love this place, and if I could live off it, I would, but got to watch my health."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and tonight was the worst! It was busy which I totally understand but our waitress would look at us and walk the other way! The food is amazing here and we always get asked if we want more but his lady was trying to rush us out the door. I had to ask three times for more Mac and cheese, she finally brought it to us cold! Did not ask us if we wanted more fries, and did not bring more water out! We clicked the call server button 2-3 times and all the waiters would look at it walking away! Finally we had to get something to go for my mother so we told her and it took 30 more minuets! It was a simple cheeseburger with fries, we even watched people get their food and we ordered this first! Like I said we go here every other weekend but not anymore!"}
{"text":"What's the point of the Red Robin cards if when you walk in the waiters get to decide that they're \"expired\"? Note: there isn't an expiration date anywhere on the cards. We refused service and left. It was a gift card from my mom by the way."}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent here for a cheaper meal our food came fast and was hot. Our server was nice a little soft spoken but the other waitresses were entirely too loud. It was towards the end of the night when I stopped in but a younger waitress just yelled across the dining room to other workers and as we were leaving she got into an argument with another older waitress. Not professional"}
{"text":"Took Collin here for lunch today. Out server was awesome. He had refills before he was even ready. We never had to ask, which was nice. 

The food was ok. I have eaten here way too many times and never had a burger before. Today was my first, it was ok. They got his order right, and if you know my kids, that's a huge deal. 

Overall a good choice. I'll stick to the other food on the menu next time we go. The burgers are good, but not $12 good. :)"}
{"text":"Love the crispy chicken sandwich! Fries are delicious! The wait not so fun! We went in around 12:45p, got a table right away, but we waited fifteen minutes to get our drink orders in and food took quite a while to come out. The screaming kids were not so fun either!"}
{"text":"Food decent, overpriced, atmosphere and service dogshit, only went to burn up a gift card, would never re-visit because it was exactly the same last time I went."}
{"text":"This place was extremely dirty and the service was really slow
It was as if the staff did not Care
I will not be going back"}
{"text":"My wife and I came in for her free birthday burger. She got the classic and I did the turkey burger wedgie style (lettuce instead of a bun). Her side was fries, mine broccoli. All the food was amazing, fresh tasting, and just as we asked. Our waitress, Angie, was sincere and obviously wanted us to have a great meal. Between the great menu sections, especially the heathy substitutes, and the outstanding service, we plan on returning here many times as our go-to place."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely incredible. I was seated right away around 4PM Christmas Eve evening.

Right away I was given a menu and an order for my beverage. The server told me about their rewards program and how to use the Ziosk module at the table. The Ziosk can be utilized to order drinks, desserts, shakes, and even call the server when the server is not present. It can also be used to pay the bill with a credit/debit card, and even has gaming capabilities for 1.99.

I started off with the shorter stack of onion rings that came with ranch and what tasted like BBQ ranch for dipping. I was given 6 onion rings, all of which were not too hot but satisfyingly warm. The only thing I did not enjoy would be that the onion rings were too large to dip into the dipping cups, so I would either have to cut them with the knife or fold them. Other than that, the onion rings were flavorful and easily some of the best onion rings I have had in a while.

I ordered a grilled caesar salad, which did not have a picture in the menu, so I would think that it would be a chopped up salad with croutons and dressing. However, what I was served was a medium-small head of romaine lettuce cut in half what was lightly oiled and grilled with a slice of lemon. The halves of lettuce were garnished with dressing and Parmesan cheese. The crouton was a bias-cut piece of French bread that was toasted. My first thoughts were, \"How am I supposed to eat this?\" Initially, I ate the salad with a fork and knife, but found it easier to just grab the root of the lettuce and munch away. Not a bad taste at all! It was something that I was not expecting but was still satisfying.

The Nacho Crunch Tavern Burger was a great burger, but it did not live up to its name. Not once did I have a \"crunch\" while eating this burger. For a moment while consuming this burger, I wondered if they had given me the correct order. I upgraded my fries to garlic Parmesan fries; did not taste garlic nor Parmesan. The extra upgrade only made the fries dryer. I had another order of the same fries and they still tasted dry. Not as much flavor as I had expected.

For dessert, my server gave me the birthday sundae for free after asking me if I like ice cream. This was rather nice, I thought. The only downside would be that the spoon used for the sundae  could not touch the bottom of the sundae bowl; I ended up scooping the chocolate at the bottom with my the tip of my knife. I also had the Freckled Lemonade cake, which was very sweet and full of flavor. It was so sweet it almost gave me a headache, however. It was still quite delicious and totally embodied the essence of their Freckled Lemonade. One thing I would like to say would be that I order the cake through the Ziosk, but it did not come until I had asked for it.

This was a very memorable experience. It was not perfect at all, but from how I was treated, it makes me want to come back for another visit. Red Robin is an excellent restaurant. Their service has dramatically changed from when I first visited them years ago. Although the food was not as good as I thought would be, the service was incredible. I'm sure if I come again I would give them their fifth star. Come to Red Robin for an unforgettable, gourmet burger experience!"}
{"text":"Worst burgers ever McDonald's better I was there my birthday they serve me a breakfast Burger and they thought you was Gourmet people stay away from that place"}
{"text":"Move along folks there's nothing to see here. Gourmet burgers! Shiiiiiiiiiitttttt. I went for lunch and was suprised to find a decent special. A double burger and bottomless fries for $7. It turns out that the flavor is akin to Hardee's or Burger King on a good day.  Yes I was belching that godawful charcoal or whatever it is essence the rest of the day. The atmosphere is ok but the burgers are leagues below Five Guys, MooYah or Culvers. You can get alcoholic bevereges at Red Robin. Come to think of it getting plastered would be the only way I could choke that fake food down."}
{"text":"Ok.  Sunday night, 5:45 we walk in.  There are 4 of us (wifey and two children).  Out of about 50 tables, maybe 15 were sat, so it was slow.  We are seated. Five minutes to put in a drink order.  Appetizer was served by 6:00.  Not bad,  Food order was taken.  This is where it really started to suck.  Our server, Francis, must have not turned the order in immediately, because we waited 25 minues for 3 burgers and a BLTA.  The manager came by to explain that our food order was \"only put in 15 minutes ago\".  Fine.  WHY THE HELL WAS IT ALL COLD WHEN IT GOT TO OUR TABLE?  Francis already told us they were having this kind of trouble from the kitchen all day. 

I really like Red Robin, but this is the second time I've had bad service at this location.  Never again.  Next time I'll go to Chevy's across the walk way."}
{"text":"What can I do??? I have a child and she like's places that have giant birds, freckled lemonade and free balloons!! Some of the food here blow's of course and some of it is really good. I really like their campfire sauce I have to have some when I come here it taste's like well.....CAMPFIRE you should just try it if you haven't yet you'll see what they mean. The other thing I love here is the chicken tortilla soup minus the chicken. It's really good with a bunch of cheese, kidney beans, corn oh and did I mention cheese!?!? The presentation is pretty and I love it in this cold weather mmmm!

For the adults they have some pretty good drinks including some wine,  Guinness and Blue Moon. I suggest eating light here like no meat but that's just me. Oh they always seems pretty polite and helpful here unlike the Shea/Scotts location but that's another story."}
{"text":"We went to this location today for my sisters birthday , placed our order and waited 45 minutes before we were served. One of the burgers was cold and had to me remade & another burger wasn't even made they forgot about it . This is the second time I went here and this happened last time all of our burgers were cold . I decided to give this place another chance which was a bad idea. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of one is because the server was very nice ."}
{"text":"Called to place a take out order. Was put on hold. Was driving from Sam's Club in Brookpark, by the time we got to this Red Robin's parking lot, we were still on hold. Decided to walk into the restaurant, sat in the bar for a good 10 minutes before someone came to take our order. LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Sorely disappointed with this red Robin location. First, when we arrived (a party of 2, both over 21), the man serving as the host made no eye contact before he started speaking with us. He put us on a wait, along with several other parties after us who he also made no eye contact with, and then proceeded to seat other small parties ahead of us. 
Two of the four steaks on the bathroom were out of order and the floor was way too sticky to be considered clean.
Then, we sat at our table for several minutes before a server came over. It was the bartender and she did the best she could. We told her we were trying to catch a movie and were ready to order. She was friendly and attentive.
However, she did not mention that the kitchen was backed up until we had sat waiting for our also over cooled. food for 25 minutes. She kindly brought the check so we could be ready to pay when the food finally came.
We ordered two tavern doubles, pretty standard. By the time the food arrived it was cold and the French fries soggy. Obviously had been sitting for awhile. My burger was charred and the bun burnt. My boyfriend's burger was also over cooked. There was no manager to be seen. And since we were in a hurry we were not able to wait. Will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"We had our grandkids with us today. I wasn't impressed with the food today. Service was great, quick and attentive. The kids enjoyed the food so they said. I didn't like the burger, it's my fault I should have asked for some pink, it was burnt and taste rough. I also should have asked for no relish , I love pickles that was great, but the relish kinda spoiled it for me. 
The baby's chicken on a stick was burnt as well and had trouble finding pieces to feed her, she Loved the fries ! My grandson loved the kids Mac-cheese. 
I am not sure I will return"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner, and we were seated quickly. Dining room was a mess. We were seated next to a table that had half eaten food sitting on it. We waited 15 minutes and no one came to even take a drink order. There was a waitress that was walking over and talking to her friends right next to us. We just left and definitely think we made the right decision."}
{"text":"Eaten here allot more times than I have checked in. Favorite place for the kiddos.

You go to chains for comfort.. and to know what you will be getting. All Red Robins are pretty much the same. Same food, same unlimited steak fries, same yummy freckled strawberry lemonade... oh yaaaaa!

This location is no different. And, we have never had a bad experience. Management takes care of staff, and staff is well trained. It shows in the service that you receive.

We live close - and the kids love - so we will be back!"}
{"text":"Well, I am a Hugh RR fan, but today it's a different story. I just ordered a tavern burger on a GF bun, no sauce with provolone cheese and it came out with American cheese. So they put in a rush order and I got my burger but I think they used the same bun cause it was hard now. 
I ordered a house margarita and was drinking it when a different waitress came over with a new margarita and said that the one I was drinking didn't look like a house margarita so she swapped them out. 
Crazy shit has been happening at this RR."}
{"text":"Great Place For The Kids 

I have to admit Red Robin usually isn't my first choice of places to grab a quick bite to eat.  However, my nephew loves Red Robin and it's a great place for the kids. 

The burgers, California chicken burger, and onion ring tower are great and have never been a disappointment.  Although, I think the burgers are getting smaller.  The fries are also very good and I love their salt. My nephew enjoys the fries because they are \"endless\" and he can eat as many as he wishes. 

Service is usually fast, prices are reasonable, and the food is good.  You could do worse in a pinch."}
{"text":"Food good but service slow and when I went to the bathroom the bus girl took my shopping bags away! I was solo and left my bags while running to pee and they were taken! She apologized and said \"thought you left\" but it freaked me out! I was gone less than 3 mins! Wow. Burger yummy and made quickly! Low review due to scare as it killed my experience. Watch bags when visiting!"}
{"text":"We go here all the time. Great burgers and fries. Good overall casual dining spot. When we're not sure where to go for dinner we choose Red Robin and we haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"Another great lunch date with my sexy gf.. I just love coming here.. Good spot for a burger, unlimited fries and good drinks.. Overall I say this is a great place to go"}
{"text":"My family and I eat here all the time and the food is good. It's one of our favorite places to go but we've recently had one of the worst experiences ever. It was a busy night and I understand that, but we had to wait 10 minutes for our waiter to even approach our table for our drink order. Not to mention the random stop he made at our table, barely acknowledging us, because he mixed up another tables receipt in the ziosk . When he got to our table he was rushing us through our order and when we finally got our food one of the orders were wrong. So we had to wait again for the correct plate to arrive. Half way through our dinner we were all out of drinks and we tried using their new \"Ziosk\" to order drinks, which personally I don't think is the way we should have to order our drinks, but the option wasn't even available so we sat waiting. While we were waiting for drinks the waiter told us his \"trainee\" would be getting our drinks. That is so unprofessional, calling her a partner or letting us know someone was helping him out wouldve been more respectful in my opinion. Overall it was just a poor example of the kind of service we are used to getting from this restaurant. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"There was a long wait so I decided to sit at the bar. I was here for over 10 minutes before my drink order was taken. We received out entree before our appetizer. 

In addition, our total bill was $21. My boyfriend handed the card immediately upon receiving the receipt. When we got the copy he needed to sign, mysteriously the bill was $32. We asked for the itemized receipt (which was NOT given back to us once she brought the copy that needed to be signed). The additional $11 was somehow added onto the check (as a tip?). Nonetheless, we spoke to the manager and all she did was take off the additional $11 added. 

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Needless to say, I will NOT be returning!"}
{"text":"Sat at a booth in the bar area and have to say Ashley who was also working the bar, making milkshakes, and dealing with call ins and pick up orders was amazing. 

She never stopped working or cleaning the whole time we were here. She also never let our drinks get below half a glass without a refill. A+ service even though they had this poor girl running all over the restaurant taking care of people."}
{"text":"Food was good but took about 30 mins for 2 burgers to arrive. When we were told someone else got our fries and we would have to wait on ours. Only 3 other tables at the time that's un called for. Waitress could have cared less as she only came by 1 time after taking our order. We also had to wait forever to flag someone down to get our bill. The staff was too busy gathering at the bar to socialize."}
{"text":"This is a Red Robin. If you want the typical American food joint, this is your place. We had a very friendly waiter and overall enjoyed our experience. I was very surprised that a martini was under $5! Compared to most places with food and drinks, the drinks were relatively inexpensive."}
{"text":"Well my favorite thing here is the Banzi burger ! Very yummy and of coarse the bottomless fries! Try the Onion Ring tower !"}
{"text":"I've been to this Red Robin a few times and went again tonight and I can honestly say that I've never had a bad experience there. 

The menu runs mainly along the gourmet burger/sandwich/salad route which is usual for a chain restaurant that is family friendly. I've mostly had the burgers and once had a salad and everything has always been prepared to my liking. 

The burger menu has quite a few options to it and they are pretty cool with letting you substitute whatever you like on them. I usually get the 'Sauteed 'Shroom and Swiss' burger and it's always been just what a mushroom Swiss burger should be. Lots of melted gooey Swiss cheese and lots of fresh mushrooms which they saute in a garlic butter. Since I need to watch my carbs (that old blood sugar thing going on) I usually get the burger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun and get steamed veggies instead of the all you can eat fries. I have tried the fries at times and do recommend them but usually go with the veggies. 

I have always had great service. Always greeted promptly by a smiling server who never lets my drink go empty. The food always comes out in a short time and is always served hot. 

It may not fit everyone's bill....but if you're looking for a good burger at a good value I highly recommend it. 

And FYI....for the holidays they are offering a gingerbread shake which sounds great. Someday while doing some holiday shopping over in Tempe I'll have to stop in for one.....on one of those days that I am REALLY watching the carb count."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE !!! I would rather eat at McDonald's then eat there again! I've been there twice and both times it was the worst ever !!!! Never going back! I'll take my money else where !!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Wish I could give zero stars. The service was bad. Our waitress was lazy and forgetful. We had to ask multiple times for napkins, forks and lemons. All 5 of our meals were cold. The fries were all cold. Asked to speak with a manager and he was very condesending, he gave us a measly $9 off of our bill so we still had to pay for cold disgusting burgers. Don't waste your time eating here."}
{"text":"I love Red Robin but unfortunately this location really dropped the ball. We ordered a few burgers for pickup and when we got them home, we realized they had overcooked 2 of the burgers severely and the sides were burnt to a crisp. Fries were still good though and not all the burgers were overcooked so thats a plus! Moral of the story:Make sure you check your food before you take it home."}
{"text":"Ok here we go!  Was seated in a booth (which we liked) and the floor under the booth was so sticky and messy my flip flops stuck to the floor!! The food was greasy and over cooked. The manager said she would take care of it. Made a new burger and she brought us another one which was over cooked. After eating the dry over cooked burger the manager came to our table and asked us to pay our bill (as if to say-- you are going to pay). She tried to charge us for both the returned burger and the recooked one. 

My humble opinion-- if you are a burger place you should know how to cook them!!  

The manager really needs training or a different career."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my dad and friend because it was convenient to where we were at the time (the hospital across the street). They seemed nice, everything was clean in the restaurant, service was good etc. 

The \"special\" burgers they have are always interesting: my friend got the promotional Wolverine burger and it looked amazing. 
I just stuck with a regular old bacon cheeseburger and that was delicious. They use good bacon (I'm kind of a bacon snob) and my burger was cooked to a nice medium rare like I ordered."}
{"text":"I like the onion rings and the fries. But the burgers are cooked on a convaiour belt. I get sick from the greasy food when I eat there. I wish the burgers tasted fresher.  The service is mediocre as well."}
{"text":"My Irish cousin-in-law told me they had the best fish and chips in town.  Well, he should know.  And they were good.  Also the fish sampler plate.  Good breading - thin not thick.  The best?  Don't think so.  Oscars is better at the same price.

HOWEVER - a 7 ox chardonnay pour all day gains a few points.  Eating in the bar with Greg as a waiter adds a few more.  So now we're up to three.  Back next week?  Probably....no, definitely not.  Maybe in a few months.

Oh, I forgot to mention.....Noisy with lots of kids!  And horrible.....I repeat, horrible parking.  Did I convince you on the parking?"}
{"text":"Can't speak for the rest of the staff but the employees at the host station seem more concerned with socializing than helping customers and keeping track of time sensitive and detail orientated matters. Two stars because one of the kitchen staff helped fixed a mistake that the host staff couldn't have cared less about after they treated me like I was invisible and ignored my order even though it sat on a shell ready while they all talked about how much they wanted to go home."}
{"text":"We have had lunch and dinner here numerous times. Service is always friendly and food is always out quick."}
{"text":"First time to this location, its only been in the neighborhood for around a year. We got seated immediately, even though it appeared to be busy. The staff was quite patient with our table, we were waiting on another member for our party, the waiting staff made sure we had our drinks and app while we were waiting. The food came out in a timely manner. My only jeer about the experience is the waitress seemed a bit over whelmed."}
{"text":"We really don't come here often.  It's a burger joint.  I can do burgers at home.  Plus it's a chain which I try to avoid most of the time.  But it was late, we had a coupon offer, and a burger sounded good.  So we decided to show-up.

As this is a burger joint I will rate it accordingly.  I will not compare it to Vintage 95.  This is a place to get a burger, maybe a salad, a brew if you are so inclined.  Nothing fancy.

They have several variants on the burger.  You can get a classic burger (with the usual onion, tomato, lettuce), a chili burger (great if you want people to avoid you for the next few hours!!), a mushroom burger, a BBQ burger, a bleu cheese burger, etc, etc.  All of these feature endless fries.  I like that.  They just keep bringin' them fries!!

Service was fine.  They could have been a bit more on-their-toes about refilling fries, but it wasn't too bad.  Burger was cooked properly and tasty.  I like using their house seasoning (in a shaker bottle) on the fries.

If you're gonna go to a chain to get a burger, this is probably one of the better places to go.  For what it is the food is good and the service is fine.

And bottomless fries is ALWAYS good.  :-)"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I updated.  This remains a solid choice for a burger and fries.  They have a few other items, but really in the final analysis this is a burger joint.  So when I rate them four-stars it's not against some high-end foodie spot.  It's a burger joint.

On this visit I had the shroom burger.  Simple as can be.  A burger, a large pile of mushrooms on top, and a bit of cheese.  Simple, but good.

The bottomless fries are also a nice touch.  As long as you keep ordering them they keep bringing them.  Add their Red Robin spice that's usually on the table for a bit of extra flavor (the fries are just steak fries otherwise).

I didn't have the chocolate shake this time, but often I do.  It's not a fantastic shake, but it's good and matches well with their burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I am basing my review on the disappointing patty melt. I did not even attempt to eat this sad sad excuse for a patty melt. A must for me is the rye bread must be grilled on both sides with cheese on both sides. The waitress assured me it was grilled but they only grill one side because they only put cheese on one side. Sad thing is the grilled side was just soggy. I think they need to take the patty melt off the menu. Don't market yourself as gourmet burgers and try to pass that off as a patty melt."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to eat and reminds me of being a kid! I always go with the Whiskey River BBQ burger, fries w/ranch and am never disappointed. It doesn't matter the location, Reb Robin is always on point.

Some of my other favorites include the Chicken Ensenada platter one I'm trying to be healthy or the crispy chicken salad with honey mustard. 

They've done a great job of keeping up with the times and maintaining their classic flavor. By far one of the best locations I've been to. It's always clean and the staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"Good place for some unique burgers.  Bottomless steak fries.  Really good but unhealthy food.

The ambience is hit or miss.  If you have a family the good thing is that it is loud.  No one will care if your kid screams once in a while because the place already has a healthy din.  However, the seating can be good or it can be a nightmare.  They have some really long benches that they line up several tables at and put them about 1.5 feet apart from one another.  When we get our own table, it is great.  When we are put on one of those bench tables, it is infuriating and there isn't enough space to deal with small children.

Only other drawback here is that their water tastes horrible.  Basically it forces you to buy a drink.  Cheap business tactic."}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian like I am, Red Robin is one of those places you get excited about because they offer meat substitutions for the things on their menu. In this case, any of Red Robin's burgers can be substituted with either a Garden Burger, a Boca burger, or their new quinoa burger. This would be great... if only they knew how to cook them properly.

Every time I've ordered at this location, both online for takeout and in-restaurant, the veggie burger comes out borderline cold, soggy, and obviously microwaved. These 100% can be grilled like a regular burger! I've realized that I have to ask for it cooked 'well-done' or grilled for it to not come out as their default standard of mush.

Another thing I noticed about this location is that they no longer ask if you want more of the unlimited fries, even if your basket is empty, when they used to before. Makes you think it's not unlimited anymore.

All in all, I would still come here. I'm giving 3 stars because the food is still pretty good and the rare option to order a veggie burger is what keeps me coming back, especially in the form of their delicious Whiskey River BBQ burger. Just remember to ask for it well-done and grilled!"}
{"text":"Decided to order carry it from here during lunch. When I walk into pickup the hostess decided since I was picking up there was no reason to greet me. I had to ask where to pickup my order. She pointed to the bar. I stood at the bar while the bartender chatted with another patron without so much as a \"be with you in a minute\" I stopped a debt coming by I inquire about my order which she stated she would get for me. I watched her go to the front line. No order. The hostess was just watching. Finally a young lady comes up to me and walks behind the bar and gives me my bag. Good grief. Upon taking the order back the food was horrible. The burger was not well done as I ordered and was very sloppily made. No words. Picture enclosed. Will never go to another Red Robin. Forced to give 1 star."}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience, from the front greeters to our server.  Guest service at it's best.  We even had the Manager stop by to check on us.  The food was flavorful and we loved the bottomless sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Been here 5 times in the last 3 months, and every time my family and I had to wait approximately 20 minutes bridge we got drinks. The servers ALWAYS say they have a \"big party\" in the back. Never been there during rush times, only 3-4 tables are occupied and the servers are always talking.

The food is always fine, but the service is ALWAYS lacking."}
{"text":"Well, came here thinking this location would be better than the one at the Galleria Mall. Once inside, we asked for the sweet potato fries as our bottomless fries...20 minutes later we got 1 basket. I asked several more times, and they kept stating \"they are working on them\".

We were here almost an hour and NEVER received more fries. This is what Red Robin is known for. 

Red Robin needs an overhaul on their hiring standard, or its training methods. Serious customer service issues.

The food is always good, and that's the ONLY reason I still eat at Red Robin."}
{"text":"Ordered French Onion soup. Took 12 minutes. Was in salamander too long. No flavor. Ordered a shrooms burger add bacon it was. Ok. No garlic parmesan flavor. KM was very accomodating. With a$15.00 gift card."}
{"text":"Other than our waitress Laurel, there was little about our stop in that could be recommended.  We waited 15 mind before someone took their time to greet us. Once we were seated Laurel was quick to take our drink order. She was quick efficient and very friendly. Food came out fairly quickly but my order was incorrect which was taken care of by our server as soon as I brought it to her attention. The food was not bad but it wasn't outstanding either the cheese on my mushroom swiss burger wasn't even fully melted.. probably won't return. Sad because I usually enjoy Red Robin."}
{"text":"Literally placed a phone to-go order on my lunch break, along with my coworker. We were quoted 15 minutes. We came in, and it was a ghost town. It took 10 minutes for anyone to even greet us. A total of 35 minutes from the time we called. We ended up walking to the bar asking for service. Then took an addition 10 minutes to get my order together, all to have them tell us her order was never placed when we placed it with the same girl Kamille. We said forget it we don't have time to wait for you to make it, hence the reason we called it in. So the manager comes up and asks what the order was like she was going to comp us for the meal for all the trouble .... after waiting for her to make it after we declined it to begin with she had the nerve to ask for payment... mind u the total was less than $7. For all our trouble we should have certainly been comped the meal."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place and I love their Cobb salad so we go here a lot, especially if we are going to see a movie or the mall. Lately we have been ordering for take out. If you are in a hurry this is not the place for you. I ordered from work so when I got there it would be ready to grab. Nope I still had to wait and on our nachos there was 2 little scoops of toppings. I ordered tonight from my house and ran to target across the street and I'm still waiting. I'm done with this place. If you aren't eating in then go somewhere else for carry out."}
{"text":"I don't know why people like Red Robin. First off, the service was bad. Asking for water, more fries, or to even order was like pulling teeth.

The food isn't all that great. I got a cobb salad and they forgot some of the ingredients in it when it was presented to me.

So I guess none of it was good. I'll just stop here."}
{"text":"Well, damn.

Until tonight, all of our experiences at Red Robin had been positive. Even at this location, our past meals had been enjoyable.

Tonight, though...tonight left a sour taste in my mouth. That's not to say that the food was bad...it was actually pretty good. But the service was atrocious.

We thought it was our lucky day when we walked right in on a Saturday night and sat right down at 7:00. We ordered our appetizer and drinks. The waiter, Cameron, came back and took our order a few moments later.

Our appetizer came out in record time! We had hardly taken a few bites of our hummus plate, and then our food came out! Like I said...the food was good.

So, where was the horrible service? The food was there fast, hot, and it was good. What could have bothered me so much?

Well, I don't think the waiter said more than a dozen words to us. It seemed like he was late for something very important, and we were his last obstacle to overcome before he was able to free himself from the self-imposed bonds of servitude to Red Robin.

Customarily, the waiter comes around after the food arrives and asks how things tasted. This guy didn't show up until our food was gone, our drinks were gone, and we were ready for the check and couple of to-go boxes.

He begrudgingly gave me a refill on my drink before he dropped off the check. Now, granted, we don't ever get desert in a restaurant...but this guy didn't even give us the satisfaction of turning down his delicious sounding proposal.

The whole process felt like we were imposing on this kid. We were in and out of the restaurant in less than 30 minutes.  This guy robbed us of the entire restaurant experience.

If you can't enjoy the experience, then why go?

It will definitely be a while (if ever) before I visit this location again. But I can promise that I'll avoid this kid like the plague if he's still \"working against his will\" at this location."}
{"text":"I was sooo disappointed with my experience at Red Robin.  The expectation I had of Red Robin was a decent place to enjoy a good meaty burger, at a reasonable price.  I visited Red Robin yesterday, everything was changed.  I did enjoy the change in scenery, however the menu changes were terrible.  All the prices went up, and the burgers were made smaller.  My expectations turned to \"I could easily do better on my grill.\"  I took a bite of my burger and I was wondering where the meat is.  Also, my poor waiter...  he was overbooked.  I'm not sure what happened, but the poor guy was running all over the place...  suffice to say service was slow.

Things I think you can do to improve.  If your going to be a good burger place as a customer want a custom blend of burger meat.  Something other than what the deliver truck drops off at every other burger place in the city.  If you put the work \"Brew\" in the title of your restaurant, carry more micro brews in your bar, maybe even some that are not at every other bar within a mile from you.  Granted Great Lakes Dortmunder is an awesome beer...  the problem is I don't have to go to Red Robin to find it...  every bar carries it."}
{"text":"Not only was this location super accommodating with our large family celebration of my daughter's birthday impromptu on a Sunday evening, but they made the whole process easy and so much fun! When I asked to see a nutritional menu for food allergies they handed me a computer to help me choose what to eat for dinner.  I was shocked! I love that they were able to assist in my being able to enjoy my daughter's birthday without needing to pick or scrape items off my dinner plate.  I cannot recommend this location enough."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times; food is usually decent but the lack of cleanliness in this restaurant is gross.  Decided to eat at the bar the other night, the bar itself had a greasy residue on it and an odor that made it pretty difficult to enjoy my meal.  Would have left without eating except that my husband and I were trying to enjoy some time out together.  Not planning to ever go back, as I've had enough experience here to know that they don't really place much importance on cleanliness.  When you have to use a napkin wrapped around the ketchup bottle just to be able to manage picking it up - this is not a good place to be eating. Gross."}
{"text":"We dined at this location on 03/14/2014 evening.

Pros: The food was fantastic!

Cons: We call ahead and put our name on the wait list. We get there and they don't have our name on the list. So whatever. The wait time is estimated to be 25-30 minutes. So....we put our name on the list once again. We wait about 40 minutes. The hostess comes outside and says sorry but our ipad system is down. Meanwhile we notice the patio is empty. Its first come first serve. We go to check it out and a server comes up to us and says to take a seat if we would like and that we have 100% of her attention. Awesome! We sit and we order. Five minutes later a party of 25 comes outside. We get our food. We didn't get napkins, and didn't get any refills. Not even a question of weather everything came out correctly. At that point we understand that she is going to be busy but we expected for her to at least come and check on us at least once. Well she did...... when we were almost finished. We wanted more fries. That took another 10 minutes. And I have to mention that she didn't bring out our food and didn't refill our drinks. We did manage to get the attention of another server to get more fries, drinks and some napkins. Meanwhile the large party is being taken care of completely. And.....the manager is helping her with that large party. He looks over at us at least twice and never bothers to ask if we need anything. We were just sitting there waiting for our tab. I'm sure anybody could see that we were annoyed and ready to go. We made eye contact and he just passed. Nothing. So after the other server brings us our tab, our original server comes over and apologizes for not giving us 100% of her time. That the large party came in and they needed to be taken care of. Ok lady....we didn't need 100% but 25% would have been nice. I get it......big party equals big tip. But how RUDE of you to treat us like trash. So disappointed. It all could have been avoided with a couple trips over to us to see how we were doing. No tip for you. We will not be coming back to this location. EVER! Completely and utterly unacceptable! Poor management at that!"}
{"text":"I've been to chain \"Gourmet Burger\" joints......this one is far from 
\"Gourmet\".......
Last evening my wife and I went to Red Robin at Settlers Ridge for dinner after a show.....
I seldom complain about a meal but this was a burger more expected to be served from a drive through window............
I ordered a guacamole bacon burger.....there was less than a teaspoon of guacamole on the sandwich.....
I asked for my burger to be cooked to a medium temperature....the burger was crispy and dry as a hockey puck.....
My wife asked for a burger with no sauce.....just lettuce, cheese, burger and onion straws.....
It came out with both mayonnaise and bar-b-que sauce.....
She sent hers back.....
She specifically asked the waitress for a burger, cheese, lettuce and onion straws.....
Her burger came back with mayonnaise on it.....
She took a napkin and wiped the mayo if her second burger.....
With two other \"Gourmet Burger\" places in the area.....I won't be back to Red Robin...."}
{"text":"I love this place. I worked at Red Robin 15 years ago and it's still one of my favorite burger places. I love the banzai burger best of all!"}
{"text":"My sister and I took our two nieces and nephew tonight. We haven't been in awhile and now I remember why. Everything we ate - two appetizers and our dinners - were loaded with salt. It was awful. I had ordered the fried cod - terribly salty. When I peeled the coating away, the fish itself was delicious. The server was friendly and efficient, which was great."}
{"text":"Food took forever to receive, refills on drinks/fries/salad took even longer (I'm literally talking 20+ minutes every time.) The waitress ignored table practically the entire time and showed zero customer service.  It wasn't even like the place was packed, they were barely even busy. We were 1 of 4 tables and there were 2 servers. Also, their card system went down and we didn't have cash so my party had to send someone to leave the establishment to go get cash with permission of the management causing extreme inconvenience and no one ever apologized. Never once did a single person offer to make any of the night right at all. Definitely won't return and definitely won't recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"So let me just say this started out as a 2 Star because our Server Melissa was very impersonable, semi-rude to my family and myself. She was not helpful at all with our questions. It was like she wanted us to know what and where everything was on that menu. And when we asked a question she hurriedly stated \"It's right there, you passed it\". Never explaining what we wanted to know. Then a family of four seated right across from us and Ms. Melissa was extra \"happy\" and \"excited\" with them offering smiles and suggestions. So we then decided that Yes we were going to speak to her manager. 

Well guess who bring us our appetizers??!!! The Manager Debra...and thank God for her because she was amazing. Her smile and welcoming spirit was what my family desired from Melissa. We told Debra how we we felt about our previous Server and asked her was she taking over for her. Well Mellissa came over at that time inquiring about our order but Debra had already handled it and politely let her know. From that point on we were more than happy. See we are a Black Family and the family across from us was Hispanic(don't think Melissa knew the difference) and we didn't want to play the race card but it was obvious to US!!! 

Debra was the best. She brought out different fries for us to sample and constantly made sure we were ok. See the thing with customer service is...you never know who is who or who is reviewing the establishment. I am so thankful that Debra(?) came in and handled the situation. And hopefully she spoke with Melissa about her people skills because whatever someone's ethnic background..,we are all HUMAN"}
{"text":"This location was just O-K, nothing worth me returning. The place was LONELY with only very few patrons, the food Meh and the service was slow.  When I think of a burger I honestly don't think of RR, but it was something close while family was visiting and we decided on something last minute."}
{"text":"I know why the three stars, because it is becoming more of a kids place and it is loud.  But their burgers are GREAT, onion rings are GREAT, and service is usually good.  I've been going to Red Robin most of my life around the country, and while I don't go as much as I used to, I always smile when I take a break from my diet and go.  Traditional Americana burgers.  I've review a bunch of restaurants for my list today.  I just made the decision to go to THIS one tonight...It has been too long."}
{"text":"Terrible take out service! Waited almost an hour for an order that was supposed to be ready in \"17 minutes\". Once we got our food it was cold, soggy, and gross. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Been coming here for decades. New more upscale feel is better for adults.  Price went up too. So many different burgers.  Yummmm"}
{"text":"Nick was a great server, food was excellent and the kids love this place. Also, Mac 'n Cheese and fruit with kids meals are refillable!"}
{"text":"It's like a whole new place in here. I didn't realize it'd been that long since we were here last but the restaurant went through a remodel...it's really nice. It's almost a little too nice where I feel like it might not be casual enough to bring my kids too. 

There was a 30 min wait when we came at 630 on a Saturday, so not completely unexpected. What was unexpected was how long it took to get our appetizer..again 30 mins..it got a little worrisome with two hungry boys. Our server Dynelle was apologetic about the wait and even though we put the kids order in right away, it still took quite awhile. 
As for the food, I had the royal red robin and it was a royal mess! The taste of the burger was good but it completely fell apart after two bites and I ate it in pieces. We also had a bowl of chicken tortilla soup and there was hardly any chicken in it.

I can handle long waits, taking a long time to fill our order, and the quality of the food but the one thing that really bothered me about our visit tonight was that the arrangement of the dining room made it so difficult for the servers to get through the aisle that twice they almost knocked into our daughter in the highchair on the end. The new big chairs for the long tables took up so much space in the aisle that the servers had a  such a hard time navigating around them when they carrying the big trays. 

I'm kinda remembering now why we haven't been in recently... You just don't get the same service or quality of food you used to a few years back"}
{"text":"why did I go here??? I suppose I bought into the marketing... Hadn't been to Red in years and figured since ALL they do is burgers, it should be pretty good. WRONG. I got a tiny double burger smothered in a BBQ sauce made from MAYO!!! Nasty. I sent it back because I requested no mayo and got the SAME burgers just scraped off and put back on my basket. cold. Fried were cold too. I sent them back and got another batch of cold fries. They did take off the burger from the bill, but please do yourself a favor and stay away from these chains. Oh and they have an outside patio facing the river that was closed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here yesterday for lunch. I wasn't especially hungry but the group I was with was. And since I've never tried a Red Robin I was up to give it a go.

The place was very busy but we were seated immediately. We were seated near a window and right away I noticed dried food on the window sill. Not a good sign.

I ordered the fish and chips which, even though I wasn't hungry, I enjoyed and finished all of them.

I also had to try a tasted on my girlfriends burger. That was okay I've had better.

Over all the food and service were decent. I'd eat here again.....but clean your window sills."}
{"text":"We've been to Red Robin a handful of times and it just gets worse every time. For whatever reason, they remodeled the whole restaurant and took down all the cool movie posters they had on the walls. Even though there's less there, it feels more cluttered now. The tables are so close to each other that your basically sitting inches from the people next to you.

Usually, the food isn't horrible. I've always had a soft spot for their steak fries. When they're done right, they are so good and you can't beat the perk of \"bottomless\" fries. This time around I went with a new burger on the menu, the smoke and pepper burger. I don't know what they did but it was terrible. The first bite I took, I felt like I literally just ate a spoonful of salt. It wasn't very hot either and the bottom bun was soggy so I think it was sitting for a while. 

We usually only come here when we have a group and no one can decide what to eat. It's been a while since we've been there so I can't be sure but I believe they raised their prices too. My burger was $14!!! Their service is always hit or miss too so hopefully it's a while before I get suckered into coming back!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Dirty restaurant and less than stellar food. Ordered the chips and queso and after complaining that it was cold, it came out cold again. We ordered the peppercorn bacon burger which was average; and I had the Marco Pollo chicken sandwich with Mac and cheese. The sandwich was bland and the Mac and cheese was cold and runny. I couldn't even eat it. At this point, we were over our meals and wasted 3/4 of each. The server either didn't care or didn't notice. He also forgot our box twice and a refill. For $50, this place was awful. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I called ahead to inform the manager we would have a large party.  We brought our entire softball team and families here for lunch and they did a great job serving our group.  The servers were friendly and did their best to accommodate everyone.  We all had a fun time.  There are a lot of restaurants in the area and I wanted to choose a kid friendly place that had a large menu and Red Robin fit the bill. They even had softball and poker on TV which was a plus.  My fav is the turkey burger.  I like the fact they offer so many choices for sides not just french fries although their fries are excellent.  I also recommend the strawberry lemonade."}
{"text":"Well I usually love the burgers here at Red Robin but at this particular location, it was not good. They served me old fries, my husbands buns were falling apart, and my kids did not like the chocolate milk. We usually eat at the Gilbert San Tan Village location and the food is good. I did not like this visit. They sat us in a very dark corner. It was so dark I had to use the light to my phone so my children can color. Probably won't be visiting this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"I always get the tavern double and it's always clutch. But being in az for this red robin something wasn't the same. Service was weak idk if was from the holiday rush but it needs some help."}
{"text":"This is a place for families! They accommodate large groups easily and have a great family oriented atmosphere.  Their servers are always on top of their game and very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's happened to this place. I've been to the restaurant previously and it was fairly good. However on my most recent visit I had a bad experience. I felt the restaurant was dirty. There was crap all over the floor under tables. The tables themselves were also not that clean and were getting bussed extremely slow (if at all). I ordered multiple items and was told they didn't have them because \"the menu changes daily\". I ordered a Heineken (didn't have it), then a Miller Lite (didn't have it), then fried pickles appetizer (didn't have it). The sign for \"Today's Beers\" was blank (super helpful). The bathrooms were also gross with no paper towels. There was a puddle of either urine or water under the urinal. We made a complaint to the manager who did nothing but look at us with a piercing stare as we described our poor experience. She then claimed half of the staff was at a co-worker's wedding and she was left with the \"C crew\". Management here needs a swift kick in the pants."}
{"text":"We stopped going to reb robin because we moved and decided that the San tan  location was the best. Since we were in the area we decided to get a burger like old times .Waited about 15 mins which was great for it being so busy. Once seated we ordered quickly knowing that I might be a while . I was seated in front of the kitchen and while waiting for my food I saw an entree sit there for 15 mins before even acknowledged . After a while I saw what seemed to be our order and I was staring at it for so long that a cook even noticed and made eye contact with me and then slid it out of my view. A couple minutes later the burgers arrived. The vegetables and cheese were completely slid of the burger, so we had to take time to take them a part and rebuild them our self's. The bottom bun was cold , flat and soggy from sitting there so long . The avocado was literally half black, not just spotted but completely old  brownish green avocado. Over all for buying the 2most expensive burgers it was very disappointing . I could see potential in the burger it sounded delicious but what we received was everything but good . Over all a bad experience , specially for 35 dollars for 2 burgers."}

{"text":"I haven't been to Red Robin in years. My Fiancé and I called ahead and were put on the wait list. As soon as we parked and started walking in, we got a text that said our table was ready. We walked into the restaurant and there was a family ahead of us being helped by the hostess. She told them that she'll take them right back. She walked away for a minute, then came back and took another family instead that seemed to be waiting outside. Which is annoying, but I thought I would give her the benefit of the doubt. If they were here first, they should be taken back first. Another hostess, an older woman, came and asked if we have been helped. I said no we have not. No further acknowledgment. She was stumbling through some menus when a new couple entered and said \"I got a text that said we were ready to be seated\" she then took them back right away. Still skipping over myself, and the couple that was here before me. Both of us were upset. When a third hostess came, she took the first couple back. My Fiancé and I were now the only people in the front room. And still, have not been helped. Finally the older woman came back. She asked what she could help us with and we explained we got a text 15 minutes ago that said our table was ready. \"Just give me a minute, okay?\" was her response and she walks away again. At this point, we are peaking out the window to see if there was a wait at Olive Garden. But we were in the mood for a burger and we thought that maybe it's just busy. We FINALLY got seated and the place was not very busy at all. The food was good, which is why I am giving them 3 stars. But I think it's ridiculous that I had to wait another 20 minutes after my table was supposed to be ready, and have 2 other people seated before me."}
{"text":"My son says, \"Red Robin is good and delicious and I really like the bottomless steak fries.  Everything I tasted was really good.  It was very loud and hard to hear.  The bottomless root beer floats were delicious as well.  I will go back there if given that opportunity.\""}
{"text":"For a resturant that has its sign touting beer and burgers, they have a very small selection of mostly domestic big brewery options from Bud and Millerr. Burger looks nothing like the ones pictured in their menu.they seem to be unaware of the Craft Beer desires of its customers."}
{"text":"Meh....food is not as good as it used to be. You can tell they are trying with their \"fancy\" burgers. Fries are no longer good, service was half ass (our server didn't seem happy to be there), what they call \"ghost pepper ketchup\" is a serious joke, and how many managers to they have walking around!? We haven't been for a long time and we know why we probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Points for being flexible. Lettuce wrapped option helps me stay on track with my special dietary needs -that I choose to ignore a lot :( 
We like the bottomless garlic fries, but they are inconsistent, sometimes they have a decent amount of cheese and flavor, sometimes you can barely taste it.

Service is OK, but what I do not like is them pushing for the kiosk things. In 2 recent visits, one of them our server brought it up and said we could use the kiosk, or let her know if we rather interact with her to pay. That was OK. On our latest visit, our server just disappeared and expected us to use the kiosk to pay (which we do not like), and of course we did not get any refills either.

Also, every time I get caught by surprise on how expensive it can get, for a burger joint."}
{"text":"The food here is always great, but service 9x out of 10 has been minimal. The food brings me back.

It was very busy and we expected a twenty minute wait but itvwas only ten minutes. The food was wonderful except the breaded mushrms were really like crumbs of breading with squished mushrm in ot and the sweet pot fries were cold and our waitress was happy to bring us anothet servong but they were also cold. My burger was cooked to perfectiom all in all awesome experience"}
{"text":"The service has improved so much since they remodeled it. They server was so attentive never let our drinks get low with out asking to refill us and the manager herself came over to check how our meal was and even got us more fries. Kwama was our sever and I didn't catch the managers name. It was a great experience."}
{"text":"$4.50 all you drink soda? You have got to be kidding me, and the server says \"you can drink all you want until 11 pm\".  To add insult to injury, it's not even alcoholic.  Water please, kthxby."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and decent paced. Food was mediocre. Good fries, but I paid $15 for a soggy burger that was supposed to have crumbled blue cheese but was all melted. My husbands burger was soggy too. They put so much ice in the apple juice my nephew thought he was drinking water. Environment is fun, as long as you don't sit by the door and have to listen to the balloon machine. Prob won't go back for my free birthday burger."}
{"text":"Once again, Red Robin made my dreams come true. One of the dreams was that I was at the most amazing place on earth and eating the best burger ever... I LOVE BURGERs!! That dream came true. I'd love to give five stars for that. Unfortunately the second dream they made come true was more of a nightmare. You know those dreams where you are trying to run but your legs refuse to move and it's like you're stuck or moving brought molasses? Well... They had VERY sticky floors. It felt like the floor refused to let me go. Now I know I'm pretty fun to hang out with and am all around great guy but not to that extreme. I could give less stars for that but my burger experience was just really good."}
{"text":"Worst RedRobbin I have been. We were there on Sunday night before Labor Day. It took about 20 minutes for our draft beers, when I questioned our server, I was told that the bar tender is very busy,when half the restaurant was empty as it was 8:30 pm. Very poor service and we were accidentally charged for chips queso and entertainment fee for my 4 year old using the kiosk.Again no warnings on the fee for using the kiosk and no record for the wrong order of chips came from the kiosk. Absolutely pathetic not to warn the customers also no pleasantries by the server at the end after the check was processes. Really rude server with poor attitude."}
{"text":"The Peoria Red Robin is super convenient for the avid movie goer since it's located right across the street from the best movie theater. 

The service is fast and friendly and the atmosphere is casual and modern. We have been coming to Red Robin for years and I will say I miss their old decor of old movie posters and random nostalgic trinkets from years past. 

The seats are comfy and the booths are roomy (fluffy friendly). And each table is equipped with a tablet that lets you order drinks, appetizers, desserts, and your meal (or you could just wait for your server but it is a time saving tool for sure)- and pay. 

The food is hot and fresh! You can customize your burger order with a variety of buns which is a plus and they offer bottomless fries AND broccoli. Kinda nice that they offer healthier options but I'll stick with the steak fries. Be sure to sprinkle the table-side seasoning on your fries too for the extra kick in flavor. 

And did I mention there is a full bar here too? Let's also not forget about bottomless root beer floats! Yes, you read that right - bottomless. Root. Beer. Floats."}
{"text":"After waiting 35 minutes for two burgers(7:25-8P), I put the call server light on. After being ignored by four, yes four employees who walked by, including our server, our server returned. He stated without asking what we wanted \"your food is being prepared now\". I said no we are leaving. Place half empty, being ignored by four staff, and only after the light being on 10 minutes being told our food is being \"prepared now\", Eek! Methinksnot. We did tell the hostess on the way out we never got our food, she said \"what you have been here a long time\". She did offer to get the manager for us, no thanks. We did not want a free meal, we just wanted to be acknowledge and not have four of your staff just walk by. Go to Five Brothers, just as good and better fries. Oh yeah, better service too."}
{"text":"Red Robin Bell Rd Surprise was always our go to place atleast once a month work or family of 7. One of the only places every one of us always find a food we enjoy. Been going to this one for about 7 years now always great service great good. Last night was complete opposite. Went there to celebrate a bday, bday girl wore bday tiara...Bday acknowledged by our waiter. That was nice. Then it went down hill.  Special item buzz clucks n mac....they are out of the buzz. No bottomless fries available...we waited over 20 min for those as an appetizer. Daughter ordered bbq chicken wrap....said no sorry we are out of shredded cheese cant.make it (no opportunity to say no cheese is fine?) So they sell her on a Caesar wrap.... which came with...shredded cheese when it got to the table? They also changed their salads....they used to be huge green leafy...now it's very sad looking and of poor quality.  Not to mention the stuffy unhappy looking manager standing outside kitchen.. roaming back and forth and not a word to guests...not even a look or smile. Also i do not like to check out using the machine on the table...we were told to use it yet told them several times we are using cash not card. It's  obvious management changed hands sometime recently and not for the better. I want our old Red Robin back! On the upside we had an amazing server. ..Austin. took wonderful care of our large group and engaged with us and the kids. ..had kids laughing and was very attentive.  Poor management. .. not his fault.  Thanks Austin!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place took my son there today for my 40th birthday ..service was awful ! We got charged for things that I didn't know we were supposed to get charged for. The chicken sandwiches were a disaster. completely fell apart ,the bottom bun was soaked and Soggy as can be. never will be back"}
{"text":"This is the best place to grab burgers. My family always goes here whenever we want to have good food good and a great time as a family. We HIGHLY recommend going here!!"}
{"text":"Good overall experience but I HATE BEING LIED TO! Beware the FALSE ADVERTISING!  Upgrade to a mega shake with a refill and don't expect a refill.  After asking for the refill two employees explained that they don't have bottomless milkshakes. We didn't ask for a bottomless (unlimited refills) milkshake, we asked for the refill as advertised in the menu. One of the employees then explained the small extra portion in the metal mixing cup served with the glass was supposed to be the refill. Would that have refilled the glass cup? No way!  Milkshake tradition dictates that the milkshake be served with the leftovers in the mixing cup. This has NEVER been considered a refill. Especially because it couldn't possibly refill the glass.
Bottom line is that we loved the staff but I HATE BEING LIED TO!!!
Dear Red Robin Marketing Department, go back to the second grade for a refresher!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and so is the service. It seems to always have a slight hint of a sewage smell especially in the bar. Other than that we eat there once a month or so."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from Red Robin last night - not great. Definitely did not have enough staff to handle all the business - waited a very long time to get my food (even though I ordered it online and was given a pickup time). When I got home it was very disappointing - no sour cream on my nachos, a piece of lettuce on my burger no bigger than a quarter, seriously 7 (I counted) french fries with my burger. Terrible considering my bill was over $40 for 2 burgers and a nacho. Definitely won't order take out from them again - no quality control."}
{"text":"Service is great. Fries are nice. Burgers are just ho hum. I don't get why everyone praises this place.  It's a bit high priced for what you get.  Servers are nice.  And they don't have any fat chicks, that's a plus"}
{"text":"Not the best service. Burger was good but nothing I couldnt get at most restaurants. Not bad just nothing I would consider \"gourmet\"."}
{"text":"April didn't seem to want to be there and was not helpful and didn't try to smile even a little. We thought they were close due to the dark parking lot and none of the signs were lit or outside lights on. Nobody greeted us when we came in and nobody said thank you when we left. Other locations we have been to had a greeter and someone always opened the door for you. Then the clucks and shrimp was WAY overpriced for 3 almost nugget sized chicken and 6 teeny tiny shrimps!!! The plate was mostly fries!"}
{"text":"The best service we have gotten in a long time. I had to ask the hostess to let our server know that we had been sitting at our table for 5 minutes with no attention and that we were trying to make it to the movies in an hour.  The server came to out table immediately after that, took our order and offered us an appetizer on the house for keeping us waiting. 2 Apps came out immediately, then our food. He checked on us often and then when he brought our check, not only were our apps comped but 2 of the five meals were comped too.  Outstanding customer service and we will definitely come back. 

Blue ribbon burger, the wings and the pretZel app were awesome."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bud light on the way home after a busy day at work. Was initially told that the keg was being changed. Fine, I'll wait it's 104 outside and I want a cold beer. 

Few minutes later I was told the Bud Light has run out and they don't have another one. It's 6:15pm on a Saturday Evening. Bartender asked if I wanted a Coors Light instead. I said no, if I wanted a Coors light, I'd have asked for one. Oh well, taking my patronage elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great burgers terrible service, there location is the only thing that keeps them open.


They advertise 50% off a second burger excluding  Tavern Burgers would not provide. They have no on line ordering, for take out, no curbside take out. Again there so busy because there location that they can be one to two star and still have a wait. 

I even emailed there Corp office first to see how they would reply, they only argued with me, no offer to make it right. There are so many other good places. Will not go back and will press the word."}
{"text":"Love Red Robin, Burgers are not super high end, but consistently good.  They have a new item on the menu, Poutine.... that I really dig.  It is not quite the same as the traditional Poutine you may have had in Canada, but it is really good...and with their garlic Aioli, it is perfect combination.   Can't beat bottomless fries either!     
   This time specifically,  one of my kids choked on something and ended up throwing up.   The staff and manager was excellent to deal with... they were so helpful at cleaning things up and making us feel comfortable.
   Additionally, the last time we were eating here... we saw a mother and daughter eating.  The daughter was probably 9-10.  Her mother got sick and went into the bathroom.  You could see the little girl was nervous sitting there on her own.  The manager came over, sent a female staff in to help the mother, got the little girl comfortable and helped them to get their food packed up.  Very caring."}
{"text":"I'm all about the Bleu Ribbon burger and the seasoning for the fries.  I am dying to try a beer shake!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Burgers smaller than advertised. Buns cold. Spent $45 for two adults and one child with no alcohol. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best service from any red robin I've been to. Not only that the food is always hot and fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I went there for lunch first time going to this one. We got there at 11:30 and pretty slow at that time it was perfect. Our waitress was very nice and did a great job getting everything we wanted before we even asked. The food was delicious. We will definitely come there again."}
{"text":"I tried a southwest sombrero salad and my wife had the fish and chips. Sara was fantastic and made those recommendations that did not disappoint. 1:30 pm on a Saturday and no wait at the door to be seated. Great lunch experience. We like the pay at table kiosk."}
{"text":"I just had the best burger I've ever had today at red robbin. It was the mad love burger and it was incredibly juicy and flavorful, blowing any other competition out of the water. The drinks are just as amazing with there unique flavors/combinations and being bottomless. The staff was on point with allowing us to take our time due to not visiting a red robin in a long time and was very friendly in general. I will be coming back here quite often."}
{"text":"The good: 
Kid friendly 

The bad:
Either they are understaffed and the wait staff has to many tables but we were largely ignored. I ordered a burger and wasn't asked if I wanted medium, well done, etc - so I got well done. Normally they bring fries to the table while you wait but our waiter was really busy...I guess. 

The food isn't so great that I would want to go back."}
{"text":"I thought the service here was great for a full house. The waiter came by often to check up on us despite juggling a few other tables. They also have tablet on each table that offers a digital menu, games for the kids, ask for a server and pay your bill conveniently if you plan to pay with a card but you can view your bill or even split it if you have a big party. 

The food came out hot. What can I say about the food it's your typical chain food restaurant so it's nothing special but if your craving a burger and can't decide what kind you want they have a pretty big selection of burgers and they offer bottomless fries"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Burgers are pricier than other burger joints. They are char broiled. Web urges had a good taste and were good sized.  They are accompanied by never ending steak fries, if you so choose. A lot to eat. Our server was attentive and kept the ice tea flowing. 
I think there are better choices out there if you are in a burger mood. BT's is one place that has a great burger for a lot less $$."}
{"text":"Fish & Chips minus the chips with a chopped salad substitution works for me at lunch.  Fewer overall calories plus four pieces of fish were quite tasty.  However, by adding tartar sauce and a glass of winter ale I am not sure how many calories might have been saved by skipping the chips...

Also, picked up two gift cards with bonus bucks good for first two months of the year.  I wonder if Mike T and Erik T will notice these comments?"}
{"text":"I just picked up my to-go order and my husband ordered the wrong salad. When I went to the bar and let the bartender know that he had ordered the wrong salad and I'd like to switch it out he was more than happy to do that for both salads. There was a difference in price but the manager was so nice and and told me it was no problem at all. We will definitely be back this is great customer service!"}
{"text":"The quality of food served in this location is terrible! I have eaten here several times, unfortunately, since it is in a good location across from the mall. A good meeting place it may be, but it is a horrible place to eat. I always wondered if the beef used for their burgers was grade D? The burgers are prison-food grade, I would honestly think you could get a better burger at a McDonald's drive-thru. The fries are terrible and taste like they came from a frozen bag of crinkle-cut fries from Wal-Mart (which is conveniently right next door). The salads are awful. Even the iced tea is of poor quality. The restaurant is dirty, the bathrooms are dirty, the space is dingy and needs to be steam cleaned from floor to ceiling. In the year 2016, this was the worst restaurant I ate at in the US, I travel frequently and eat at hundreds of different restaurants during the course of a year, and my friends and I always tell stories of how bad this Red Robin is! Really, truly, disgustingly and embarrassingly horrible -- and totally unacceptable for a chain restaurant with this large of a nationwide footprint."}
{"text":"Had the veggie burger which was quite tasty. The onion rings (not refillable) were just average, along with the fries (refillable).

The service was not friendly however it was efficient."}
{"text":"This Red Robin is sad and old.  The place feels a little dirty and like it's time for a facelift.  My waitress was very nice and I received fast service.
The food is the big problem at this location.  The fries tasted like the oil had gone rancid and the water tastes like it came out of the toilet.  Everything was tainted by the bad flavors.  Sorry Red Robin, normally you are a good standby lunch."}
{"text":"Kelle, our server made the night delightful. We had a party of six but not all arrived together. Kelle attended with a smile. The food came out fresh and hot as ordered. Love the no fee sauces--- made the broccoli so nice. Appreciated the sundae birthday treat and sing. Most jovial."}
{"text":"Our waiter always had to be flagged down just so he can fill our drinks and instead of asking if we needed anything. Restaurant just opened and there must have been 4 tables occupied. Our server sucked."}
{"text":"Came in tonight to slay my burning craving for a dank burger. It was alright. I don't think the meat had much flavor in its life. But hey all that doesn't matter because our server RYAN was awesome!!!! (so was my milkshake & fries) He was extremely attentive, polite and quick like lighting! Grabbing that fresh second bucket of fries in record time. Cheers to you Ryan!"}
{"text":"This review is for the  pre-opening of Red Robin in Downtown Summerlin. The atmosphere is quite cheerful. There are several dining spaces which are very brightly lit and have colorful designs. 
The wait staff was extremely helpful, very knowledgeable of the menu and friendly. Although the restaurant was packed service was timely.
The Pretzel Bite appetizer was a great starter. The pretzels were warm and soft. The beer cheese dipping sauce was the perfect paring.
The DGB Burger consisted a a juicy beef patty with roasted tomatoes, garlic aioli and arugula on a toasted  ciabatta bun. 
The Gourmet Cheeseburger was cooked just as ordered and included melted American cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, pickles and mayo. 
The battered  Artic Cod Fish was crispy and fried to perfection. It is served with a tasty dill and pickled tartar sauce. 
The burgers and fish entree all come with the bottomless steak fries that were not the bit greasy and delicious.
Looks like this place is ready for it's Grand Opening"}
{"text":"It's a Red Robin, so you should know what you're going to get.  The food here was consistent with every other Red Robin I've eaten at.  Which I generally classify as not great, but not bad either.  

What made me decide to give this particular Red Robin 4 stars is the service.  Both times I've been there, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the waitstaff.  The place seems to be staffed with younger adults who actually care about doing a good job, instead of the fresh out of high school clueless types.

If you don't mind Red Robin food and are in the area, stop in to this place and enjoy some decent service."}
{"text":"To summarize my experience here I would say it was \"meh!\"  We only stopped in while we were waiting for our reservation to be ready elsewhere so we sat at the bar and had a drink.  The bartender didn't start out very friendly however as we continued to sit there he warmed up to us.  He asked if I wanted a single or a double and I asked how much the double was which seemed to stump him.  Interesting.  Then under his breath behind the bar he was on his phone and said something along the lines of, \"My god.  Where is my sister?  I'm going to smack her\".  Probably not something you want to say in ear shot of your guests.  The drinks were priced OK, a double Jack & Coke was $10.  The location is convenient if you want to grab lunch or a drink after shopping but I don't think I would go out of my way to come back to this location."}
{"text":"Went into the bar for a short order. Was treated very poorly and left with a bartender laughing at me. I'm usually a fan of Red Robin. However, this takes the cake with horrible customer service. I hope they manage to reprimand that bartender. I won't be returning and when people in the area ask my recommendation. I won't be recommending."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant before many years ago and I think I'll stick with the memory from the past. 
When we pulled up, the there was a lot of people out front. It's a large sitting area with plenty of room for kids,to run around and play while waiting for their table. I checked in and they asked for my phone number. I guess a new tech feature...they'll text you once the table is ready. Nice. 
Anyway, once we were seated, we waited a little bit before we even got cutlery for the table. I ordered my 3yr old meal first (it's just better that way) and our drinks. 
10 monutes later, our waitress returned to take our orders. 
I ordered the Marco Pollo. ( chicken sandwich). My husband ordered some Sriracha burger. 
Ok, I was pumped for our food. It's burgers. Yummy right. 
Nope. Nothing special. Mine kept falling apart. Annoying. And it really wasn't even tasty. 
My husband said his..was just a burger. Not even my son had his. 
Plus, they came back uhmmmm...never with \"bottomless\" fries. No water for the table. 

So I'm sorry. Don't think I'll be dining here again. At least not for a couple years."}
{"text":"Did not like...my burger was under cooked actually it was still breathing. YUK. Would have liked the burger if I was a vampire."}
{"text":"Terri is awesome!!! I waited less than 10 minutes for my pick up order, paid & out the door!! On a Sunday night when they were super busy. When I left the line was out the door. Super friendly & efficient. Will be back"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great, drinks were perfect. Hannah our server was very knowledgeable about the menu, and was very helpful and attentive throughout our entire meal. Thank you Red Robin for hiring very friendly and efficient staff.  And thank you Hannah for the wow service!"}
{"text":"Just tried the turkey burger and it is awesome! I try to watch what I eat and not eat fast food, but this is a place I'm willing to visit often."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We were coming here at least once a week because I loved the burgers, but we haven't been in for a while and was surprised to return to a much smaller hamburger (or they changed the bun size to huge) because I could barely taste the burger and was pretty much just eating the bun.  My Ultimate Margarita was horrible and just way too sour. Too many other good burger places around.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here to eat on a night out with 4 friends they messed up on 3 of our orders food was nasty and cold they took forever and we basically had to ask for them  to give us a discount which was 2 dollars off our bill wow ..never had such a bad experience at this Red Robin clearly change of management.. Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"Last night I really wanted Red Robin, so we went there. And I ordered one of my favorites. Cutting into my burger like I usually do; I noticed it was kind of hard to get through the middle. When I finally got through it I noticed a white layer that looked funny. So when I lifted my bun I realized there was still paper wrapping for the cheese on my burger. We asked for the manager, the waitress that we asked was rude. Then the manager came over asked what was wrong I showed her and she took it fast, without saying much; not even an apology for the BOH. Then came back and told me they're making me another one. Still, no apology and my waitress didn't even come over to ask if anything else was wrong or be empathetic either. I don't need sympathy. But to not show any care for a customer like that for something like this happening. No. And on top of that we still had to pay for that burger. I'm so disappointed, I love Red Robin. Never had a complaint before but last night the service and food quality was extremely poor."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at Red Robin, neither have I ever had a 5 star experience. The food is good and the atmosphere very laid back and relaxed... You can wait for up to 45minutes to get a table though. The beer floats are really good and are highly recommended - it is an acquired taste though. Don't expect earth shattering anything at Red Robin and you'll have loads of fun. :-)"}
{"text":"1st time visit. I've heard nothing but good things for years but never had the opportunity to try before. I could have waited longer. I did get there early, about 11:15, so I understand they weren't in full gear. I was seated in the bar area, no problem,  but it was dirty,  like the tables weren't wiped from the last customer,  last night. Server was nice. It did take almost 25 minutes to get my hamburger. Was not impressed. A little dried out and microwave bacon. Not the freshest roll all for $14. $3 for a Coke. My server also had to hit 3 different registers before one had any paper in the printer. Not very good prep or closing.  Maybe it's just thus location or a bad day. But I'm just not sure about it."}
{"text":"After never being to a Red Robin in my entire life, lately I've become a local-RR-chain connoisseur. 

Don't judge me. I'm not there for the burgers, OK? In fact, I'm almost positive most people aren't there for the burgers, but probably some other favorite off the menu. Me? Well thanks to a certain Mister, I have a new addiction. I don't like steak fries. But a big, hot, never-ending basket of hot, fried hunks of potatoes to sprinkle mounds their ridiculously delicious Red Robin seasoning all over? THAT is what I'm talking about. Then dunk those in a side of their buzzard sauce and you now understand why I'm addicted. 

Other than gorging myself on french fries dipped in hot sauce, the rest of the Red Robin experience is pretty \"meh\". I typically get the tavern burger, which is like a child-size burger with two, tiny patties. It's just a plain ol' burger. Tasty, but not life changing. Meat, cheese, tomato, lettuce, pickle between bread. No crazy artisan ingredients, just greasy burger-stuffs. 

Now I suppose I should explain the 1-star. Welp, having been to a few different locations now, I know what to expect. It's a chain. You should be able to depend on consistency, right? Not at this one. We were served our fries with hot sauce that had a 2\" thick layer of grease sitting on top. It didn't resemble anything close to what their Buzzard Sauce looks like. So a 1-star over sauce? 

1) Having worked in the service industry before, I would never serve anything that didn't look like what the customer was expecting. If I saw something burnt? I'd send it back to the kitchen and explain to the table. So how hard would it have been to ask them to make a new, tiny, plastic container of sauce? 

2) When we asked for a different one, she argued with us. Normally I'd consider her expertise since she works at the damn place. But clearly she had no idea what she was talking about. It's not brain surgery. It's chain-restaurant hot sauce. Instead we got her theory on how the sauce separates when it's heated (umm, probably if it's boiled to the point of obliteration) and that she could get us some cold sauce. Because the 18 other times I've had this sauce at other locations it was warmed--not cold, not separated. 

3) We were sitting at the bar, so I expect slower service. But the bar itself was empty and this girl was flailing. We were the only people sitting at the bar and she couldn't keep up with us. 

Stick with the Indepence location."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for a family dinner (11 people and a baby). Our server was awesome! We got plenty of refills, always had some extra fries and she seemed like she actually loved her job. Will be happy to come back here! Forgot the servers name but I remember she owns some snakes!"}
{"text":"Where to begin, well the host was very friendly and sat us a booth in the bar. Our server took a while to come over to us even though there weren't hardly any people there. My dad had applied for some Red Robin's club card and he was to get a free appetizer for applying for it. They had issues getting his confirmation code to work though and instead of being helpful- like just giving the free appetizer- they said they couldn't do anything to help us and gave my dad some RR card help line to call, even though by then it was closed.. They did not offer us the appetizer and weren't very helpful.  Then we ordered drinks which took a while and then we finally got to order dinner. The dinner came out and I had a smaller burger but it still came with bottomless fries. Me, being the fry-lover that I am ate all of my (smaller portion) of fries. I asked for more. We waited for 20 mins and still no fries. I eventually had the server cancel the extra order (since they were to be bottomless) and got the check. It was poor service on their part. The server did apologize after I asked for the check. He ignored us for the most part though, which made me mad since it wasn't busy in the bar area at all. All in all, I like the Applebee's across the street from this location more  and will take my business there next time."}
{"text":"This was the second time I had ever been a Red Robin, and this particular location really saved my opinion of the chain! The first time I went to a location, nothing stuck out about the food other than it was expensive. This time, however, I saw a noticeable increase in quality! My burger was very juicy, cooked to perfection, and accompanied by near perfect amounts of other ingredients (lettuce, tomato, condiments, etc). The fries had clearly just been made, as they were steaming hot and delicious. Tip: Order ranch and/or Tavern Burger (re: Thousand Island) dressing on the side for your fries! Our service was fine - nothing to write home about compared to the food, but not bad by any means. I will say that the restaurant did its best to accommodate the dinner rush in a timely fashion, as opposed to some of the other neighboring restaurants, which was very nice!"}
{"text":"Love Red Robin. Killer French fries and best burgers anywhere, great service. This one is also very clean and has great service"}
{"text":"Something wrong is going on at this location and I don't mean the remodel. We use to have a visit to our table by management, no more, that hasn't happened in months. They use to have fun, really good wait staff, that seems to have disappeared too. My waiter is one I've had before, tonight he was off his game and just appeared overwhelmed, I think maybe understaffed for a Saturday. Food was fine, although the time before last they messed up and sent out meat instead of the ordered Veggie Pattie, a suggestion-maybe, plate them or wrap them different so staff can tell the difference and not serve it."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday celebration. I had called earlier in the day and asked about reservations. They told me that they didn't take reservaions, but that they would take my info and work with us when we got there. (Table of 6, so not huge). Arrived. The hostess had never heard of me. Had asked for a booth. Got 1/2 table, 1/2 booth. Sitting about 12 inches from the next table. Menus were gross and sticky. Table was sticky. So noisy you couldn't hear the person across from you. Service was inconsistent. Manager helped out some (thanks). Food was good except for soggy sweet potato fries. Crappy computers on the table take up room and depersonalize the experience. We're,going to order dessert, but it took so long to get the waitress that we stopped for dessert on the way home. All in all, a bust of a birthday celebration. We went home unnerved and with headaches."}
{"text":"I'm going to start this with normally I love red Robin but my last time there was horrible my fish was so salty that was salt all over my fingers a burger was so nasty that my niece didn't touch it it's really not like them when I talk to a manager before I left he basically did nothing I was so surprised I was kind of just not his problem so I like or love most Red Robin but not this one"}
{"text":"I was in the Tempe Marketplace area with my girlfriend when we were trying to decide what to get for dinner.  While neither of us craved anything in particular, we remembered learning how Red Robin is known for their bottomless fries.  We figured tonight was the perfect night to test this out.  And well...they sure were bottomless!  

There was a bit of a wait for several parties ahead of us though we found a nice table near the bar area to avoid the wait.  The service was good, and we decided to order a Whiskey River BBQ Chicken sandwich for me, and a Simply Grilled Chicken for my girlfriend.  While we were certainly looking forward to chicken (we know...Red Robin is a burger place!), we were REALLY looking forward to the fries.  

Initially, we were each given a very small serving of fries though as we went through them quickly, without our asking, our server brought us a basket of fries (which were later refilled once and upon being asked again if we wanted more, we finally decided we were finished with fries...for a long time!).  The chicken sandwiches were fine but nothing too special.  In fact, my Whiskey River BBQ Chicken had to be sent back as the onion strings and the BBQ sauce were both missing, but that was quickly remedied.

They also have a birthday club that sends out regular discounts during the year.  Definitely tell them it's your birthday if you're celebrating, and in addition to the birthday burger, you may even get a sundae.  

All in all, a nice experience, and we certainly have had our fill of fries to last a while."}
{"text":"My experience a the Red Robin in McDowell was not the best. I was catered by an employee named Bailey and she was extremely rude. She approached my group of friends and I inefficiently with her poor manners and harsh remarks."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger medium with an egg over easy.  It came with a egg sunny side up.  I sent it back.  It came again with a sunny side up egg.  I sent it back again. Then it came over hard, yoke cooked solid.  By then my lunch hour was almost over, so I decided not try again.  That's when I learned the burger was well done, not medium.  It's an egg and burger.  Burgers are their specialty.  No excuse.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant many times and we will not be returning. We went on a Sunday afternoon and there was no crowd, plenty seating was available. The hostess looked less than happy to have to take the time to seat us. 

We waited patiently as our server appeared to be doing all the work. We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer. After some time the server brought some fries while we waited, but the fries looked like they had been under the heating lamp for quite some time. When the chips and salsa arrived, the salsa was frozen. 

I ordered a salad with grilled (blackened) chicken - I don't recall the name of the dish, but the picture made it look good. When it arrived, the chicken was done but it looked and tasted like the chicken that is precooked, heated in a bag and placed on the salad. 

It was the first time I felt sick leaving this restaurant. Not sick from the food, but sick because we spent over $50 for 2 adults and a kid and no one was remotely satisfied with their dinner. 

The service wasn't great, but I believe it was because the server was overwhelmed. I don't know what the other servers were doing, she seemed to be the only one trying to accommodate the customers."}
{"text":"Seated in the bar so we can watch the MNF game. Waitress took our orders and we watched for 10 minutes as the bartender played on his phone before noticing our order. Then taking his sweet ass time to bring out drinks. Younger generations and technology = shitty service. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Why do they even get a star! My friend and I visited RR at 2 different locations and both had gotten food poisoning. Within a week. Watch for bad batch of something right now! Cold sweats, vomiting, and sharting! Good luck and don't forget to tip the waiter. It's not their fault if you get sick."}
{"text":"The food is good, bottomless fries are always great. Usually I have good service, however this time it started off very bad. The server wasn't as experienced and was taking her a while to get to us, but then the manager was EXCELLENT. He came to our table, took our drink and food order and had it personally delivered to us by the cook in less than 10 minutes. Even after he made up for it, he apologized and made sure we were all taken care of. 

What a way to turn a bad experience into an excellent one."}
{"text":"When you walk in there's usually somebody waiting to seat you. 

Sometimes have to wait a minute or two if it's not very busy. Not a big deal.

Since they've redesigned the interior it looks absolutely amazing in there! I actually enjoy sitting in there now, it doesn't look like a Crayola crayon drawing of a Chuck E. Cheese's restaurant. 

The manager there Dom, is a great guy he will take care of you handover fist! He gets the job done no matter what it costs.

The servers and waitresses are usually awesome! I think I've had one bad experience out of the entire time I've been there and I've been going there for about 10 to 12 years or so. 

The food is also extremely good. A little bit more pricey than I would like, but I'm not complaining because you get a large amount of food when you order it.

The milkshakes dog, mmmmm dem milkshakes that'll give you the quakes. Fries that'll cross your eyes. Burgers, well they just have burgers. 

Really though, the burgers are absolutely phenomenal!! 

POWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW it's that good."}
{"text":"Lunch service was quick and efficient. Food was good- hot and fresh. The waitress was great. This is definitely a quick go to and get out if you work in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday burger. Horrible service. Someone dropped off my burger and fries and nobody ever came back to ask how my food was or offer me more fries. Good thing it was a free birthday burger, I wouldn't have been happy if I had to pay $12 for that. Want a real burger in this town? Head over to New York Flavor. You get a better burger for a better price."}
{"text":"Service can be slow for sure. The new southern charm burger is very yummy. The chili chili cheese burger says on menu it's open face but that's a lie. Someone at red robin really needs to look up open face burger/sandwiches. It use to come open face not sure how they forgot what open face means."}
{"text":"Throghly unimpressed. My husband had the cod fish and fries.Cod was really greasy and the fries were just OK. The cod was also not seasoned at all! My food was so bad I sent it back and at warmed over Chipotle when I got home. I orderedthe grilled chicken fajita type meal. Th cicken was clearly cooked hours earlier and was cold and dry. I tool one bit and sent it back. I do not mean luke warm but cold as if it had been in the fridge. My drink was OK. I had a sugar rimed margarita. Too many kids, not my scene. I tried Red Robin now Iam over it."}
{"text":"Wouldn't have thought, but they have a salad that is a meal in itself. The sci-fi is a Cobb salad with chicken and avocado. It is delicious and very filling. If you are not in the mood for a burger, get the salad. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could rank this place a zero I would. But not for food or management. The food is always great. It is a zero for customer service. Now, I go to many other red robins. I usually order a chicken sandwhich without the bun to keep it on the healthy side. But what I really want is the bottomless fries. So four or five months ago I go to this location and ordered my drinks. I then asked if I could get some fries to start as they are bottomless. I was told no they dont do that. I had been to that location many times. That was the FIRST time i was ever told no when asking that. Usually I also tip 20%...actually always. After leaving there, i felt ashamed because i didnt leave a 20% tip for the first time ever. Now today, after going to many other red robins and even that same one, I get the same waitress. My mind was made up; If she told me no fries to start I was leaving. Sure enough, nope can have fries. I immediately said ok we are leaving ( i was with two others). The manager rushed over to correct the situation. He told me that she meant to say that it will be a bit, not no we cant. So either one of them was lying. I dont deal with horrible customer service. I wont be going to this location anymore and the lady that was our server is and was awful."}
{"text":"There isn't much to say other then I've given this place too many chances! Their food is really quite disgusting. I ordered a blue moon beer and the waitress actually poured orange juice in my beer without permission... What real beer drinker would ever request that is beyond me?!?! I ordered blue moon btw because they really had no good beers available other than domestic. They have messed up my order in one way or another each time I have gone there. Sadly I'd rather eat five guys across the street and that isn't saying much."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today. Place was packed. Got there before they opened which was good. Got a table right away. The burgers were ok, nothing special. The chocolate milk shake was very good. Will go back and sit in the bar next time. There were 6 of us and no beer and our bill was still $80 after tip. Not sure if that's gonna fly at a burger joint."}
{"text":"This is our go to burger restaurant for many reasons.  First, the food is great.  The burgers have always been cooked exactly as ordered and nothing seems like too much trouble for them.  Beverages are refilled without even asking.  Love that children are so welcome and that they give them balloons, a children's menu and coloring supplies.  The service is really excellent.  We will continue to go here when we are in the mood for burgers.

Well, we've been back several times but imagine our surprise when we returned a few days ago and found it was completely renovated.  It is beautiful and beautifully decorated.  The silly bird and the pictures are gone which is fine with me.  Much more upscale but the same wonderful service and food and still very child friendly.  We'll be back next week when our grandchildren come to visit - they will love it."}
{"text":"Oh Red Robin, I *hate* myself for loving you!

Once again, this is absolutely not a four star restaurant but they get four stars from me!

I order the Bonsai burger every time.  It's got a grilled pineapple on it, and that makes it healthy--almost like a fruit cup.  

I've always had pleasant service here and this is probably one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to if you need to eat out and you've got a picky kid with you.

In fact the last time I was here with my then 6 year old cousin, he ordered the chicken strips and then hugged the waitress and told her they were the best thing he had ever had to eat, ever.  

While I haven't found Red Robin to be HUG THE WAITRESS good, these burgers are terribly good, and then they are made even better with the basket of endless fries.  The last time I was here I opted for the steamed broccoli as my side instead of the burger.

The burgers came out and I took one look at the broccoli, said, 'what was i thinking?\" and then immediately started to steal my friends fries.  Don't be me.  If you're eating at Red Robin your diet for that day is dashed.  Commit to sin, and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at a Red Robin location. My husband and I had to wait 5 minutes for the hostess, there was only one which we understand. The first server said that he would take care of us but after 5 or 10 minutes he did not return another young lady came up and asked us if we would like something to drink over the shoulder of my husband without looking at him, and gave us water. I asked for lemon and never got it. We also ordered my husband's burger no tomato and tomato was present on the burger. We also ordered my husband burger no tomato and to meet it was present on the burger. The food was otherwise absolutely delicious which is why it makes me sad to make this review. None of the servers that we spoke to introduce themselves or apologized for any inconvenience. After calling over a supervisor he also did not introduce himself but did apologize saying that they were \"swamped, and only had 2 servers\". Me being a server I can understand that. But none the less you can make the experience more personable. Like you're happy to have my business. Overall  1 star for the service, and 1 for the food."}
{"text":"Expect poor service at this Red Robin. The wait to get your order in and your food will be long and your food will not be steaming hot. Your food will be left under the warmer for a long time and maybe the chef, host or manager will help deliver the food otherwise your server will deliver it to you lukewarm. And expect your server will disappear once your food is delivered; and if you need anything you must flag down anyone who works at this place or walk to the kitchen to ask for something. This place is better off a self service establishment."}
{"text":"Slowed in for another late dinner. Still find it odd that the  bar still doesn't carry amaretto."}
{"text":"I love their lettuce wrapped burgers. The waiters are always pretty fast and attentive. Not to mention their endless salad anddddd sweet potato fries for the hubby. Everything we have ordered is always tasty."}
{"text":"Always go here for my dad, who loves their burgers. They're a typical chain - decent food, decent prices. That's about it"}
{"text":"Excellent manager. The people at the table near us were being very rude/conniving and he dealt with it very professionally and was very accommodating. Also, they were out of truffles so he gave us 50% off another dessert instead. The waitress was also very polite. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"I'm usually down for Red Robin as I love a good burger, but my recent visit to this location had me running for the door.

Red Robin is great spot for some pretty decent burgers and chicken sandwiches. The bright colors and décor scream family friendly and they definitely go out of their way to please young children. (The TV in the floor is cool touch) On an average visit you will hear their rendition of the birthday song several times. Fortunately, there is a full bar and good happy hour for the grown-ups. 

It had been a while since the last time I was here so I convinced some friends to check it out around lunch time. We were promptly seated by the host and greeted by our server, little did we know that this was going to be the last time we saw her. I decided to get my usual, the peppercorn burger and onion rings to share. After we made our selections, we waited for our server to return... and waited and waited and waited.

About ~20minutes later one of the bussers came over looking confused and asked if someone had helped us. He acted like we had just taken menus from the front and just sat down randomly. Soon after a new server appeared, for whatever reason she seemed annoyed that we were there; as if we had done something wrong. For whatever reason our food came out in waves; after the onion rings I was the first to get my food. We were expecting the other two dishes to come our soon but they took almost 30 minutes. My friend who ordered the bruschetta chicken sandwich was brought out the fish and chips instead, I have no idea who they mixed that up. They brought out her correct order later but our other friend and I were long finished with our food. My request for an additional serving of the \"bottomless fries\" also seemed to have been quickly forgotten as well.

 Not sure what we did to deserve the neglect but it sucked."}
{"text":"Yikes!! Service was stupidly poor! Really you forgot my drink order??!! Then we ask for some fries to come out before our food.. and all we get is a lousy \"5\" fries in a basket for 4 people!! I am sorry but this waitress is either ignorant or incompetent!"}
{"text":"Red Robin does not dazzle me... Service is always poor. Drink refills take a long time, and when you ask for fries to come out before your food the staff just seem very annoyed and when you finally get the fries there only a few in the basket. Trust me there are better places with better service."}
{"text":"I was just in there. Some blonde lady with short hair told me it was going to be a 10 minute wait, as she had to sit two families before us. Ok. My woman and I waited maybe 5 minutes, when suddenly the lady tells me \"Ok, sorry about that. Management wants us to tell all the guests its a 10 minute wait right now, because the kitchen is *a little FUNKY* right now\" Funky?!?! She couldve said the kitchen is backed up, or running short staffed tonight, but she said the kitchen is backed up because the kitchen is FUNKY! So we immediately left their funky ass establishment. Im typing this review from Outback right now. My beer just came. Bye."}
{"text":"Ok, I'll admit Red Robin is a guilty pleasure. There are times in every foodies life where you just want to get a burger with your kids and not worry about the seven course tasting menu or what vintage of White Burgundy to order. 

We went here to celebrate a special occasion with my oldest son, a meat-loving seven year old who LOVES Red Robin (god bless him!) Atmosphere is fairly loud and busy with lots of TVs showing either sports or cartoons. Basically a kid paradise.

Many are suckered at Red Robin by the various burger combo's, typically which include bacon, some sort of sauce and an assortment of fried products on top. Blah. Not only do these mask the flavor of the beef, but they also reduce your life expectancy by at least six months. As a result, I order the \"natural burger\" with a whole wheat bun, lettuce, tomato, red onion and blue cheese. My better half ordered one of their new fancy salads and my Little Man ordered the cheeseburger. Ironically we also ordered the mini-app of onion rings (also known as the cardio-kicker). Can't resist onion rings, damn it!

Overall, no problems with this meal AT ALL. The steak fries that come with the burgers are pretty good and the Red Robin seasoning is addictive. The burger itself was a good size, cooked well and the toppings were fresh and crisp. BTW, I highly recommend the whole wheat bun because it is fresher and more substantial than the mushy standard bun. The salad also looked pretty good (no wilted lettuce or weird chicken). This is not the gourmet burger offered at BLT or even Big Daddy's, but it was still very tasty and you could taste the beef.

We ended our meal with, what else, but a Chocolate Milk Shake. Perfection as usual.

Thumbs up to this mass-market marvel. Carry on Red Robin - go forth and spread your message of beefy goodness!"}
{"text":"So I've been in here a lot. When I first came in I was greeted by a man named Michael. He was very polite, asked us how we were and how many were in the party. When we told him the number, he said politely \"give me just a few moments while we set something up for.\" He was super energetic and I could clearly tell he loved being there. When he walked up, we had a manager come over to ask if we had been helped, we said yes. I think he said his name was Matt. Plain blue shirt and no name tag. He started talking to us and I'm sorry but he was VERY arrogant. He kept on making the same jokes over and over. We laughed it off, but I was unimpressed. Our host Michael came back and said I have it all set up for you and I take you back now with a smile. We gathered the troops and headed back. He politely waited for us all to take a seat (and we we're long lol) but he had a good spirit and laughed with us as we tried to find our positions. Kameya was our server. And she was WONDERFUL! Very joyful and helpful. As we got our appetizers, Matt came back around to (again, sorry to say, BOTHER US!) He repeated the same jokes again. And I kept thinking, does he not remember us from 10 minutes ago!!! He stood there for about 10 minutes continuing to talk and I just grew tiresome. I was there to eat and enjoy with my family and friends that were in town. I understand that he was checking on us, but C'MON! We're smiling and laughing eating a tower of onion rings. Just leave us ALONE! We are having a good time. All in all, the food was great, Michael and Kameya were amazing! They even thanked us again for coming in as we were leaving! A++ But the manager Matt just grew on us to where we were ready to get up and leave. I have never been to any restaurant that I've had a manager come over and give up a 15 comedy sketch of unfunny jokes. It was just restless and annoying. Thanks RED ROBIN, but we're all consider a different location."}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food. Got sick that night from eating one of their burgers. I don't suggest eating at this Red Robin."}
{"text":"Had a great waitresses attentive and friendly  the whiskey river burger was very good Cooked well 
Friendly family surroundings"}
{"text":"Service was so amazing. We came for my Pap's birthday and the servers happily pushed tables together just so he was comfortable and had room (he has trouble walking). Meals were excellent and came at a timely manor. Our server was amazing, refills, sides, sauces she had immediately. I wish I got her name to mention here! Absolutely awesome evening with family! Thank you to all workers there!"}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 stars I would.

We come here a few times a month because it has something everyone in our family likes to eat. This place is really hit or miss, we have found 1 out of 4 visits we either have bad service or bad food. We have had bleeding burgers served to us, kid's mac and cheese with only 5 noodles, cold in the middle crab cake burger, spilled oranges all over a grilled cheese (rendering it soggy and inedible by my 3 year old) and have had a handful of bad servers. But seeing as how we have been here over 30 times, a few bad experiences do not out way the good ones we have had. And anytime we have had something bad happen they have ALWAYS made it right.

My go to's here are the bonzai burger, fish and chips, fish sandwich.

I do not recommend the crab cake burger

Give them a shot, and if something isn't right you need to speak up because management is always willing to make it right for you!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Red Robin in about 15 years it hasn't changed one bit. Always good burgers Big Time combinations bottomless fries bottomless root beer floats and cream sodas I got the $6.99 cheese burger which is a good deal"}
{"text":"I do like Red Robin, especially the bottomless fries. I'm a sucker for their honey mustard.. I usually don't like mustard but their honey mustard is awesome!  I tend to get the banzai burger, but I have tried the Ramen Burger (which was surprisingly tasty), and recently the Wedge Burger which is a protein style. I got the meat with no pink this time, which sadly I think does take away from a juicy flavor that is attained when there is pink in the meat.  They have a poutine which I've had twice. The first time wasn't too memorable, but recently had it and it seemed tastier. But definitely seems fattening!  Haven't gotten up the courage to get the bottomless steamed brocolli, but maybe one day.."}
{"text":"I came here last night for dinner with a friend and her 6 year old daughter. It was fine, 4 stars, but just for a Red Robin. You know? If you come in here expecting a Bad Daddy's kind of burger and atmosphere, you'll be disappointed.

Our server was Katie, she was training another girl - I can't remember her name. But Katie was very friendly and helpful. Every time we asked for something she went running off to get it. I got the bacon cheese burger, with bottomless fries. The fries are very good (apparently, they sell them in stores?) When I finished my first little cup of fries I wanted a handful more - but not too many. I tried to explain this to Katie, like \"portion controlled bottomless\" haha. She asked for me to give her a number, like how many fries... \"Seven.\" And that's exactly what she came back with! *see photo* It was a perfect \"portion controlled bottomless fries\" interaction. We all enjoyed our food, and Emileigh (6yr old) was given crayons and paper to keep her busy. So this is a nice! family friendly place.  I wasn't super impressed, but it's good for a quick and low priced burger. I'll come back, but I probably won't crave it."}
{"text":"It was two years ago that we started cutting carbs and this was the first restaurant that we had tried to dine out at the time. When we asked our server for \"no bun\", she recommended \"protein style\" which basically means a lettuce wrap. Huzzah!!

I hadn't tasted a burger that was so juicy and filling and satisfying like that.

Since then, the meals are still been tasty; but the service has dropped a tad. Servers have to ask us what \"protein style\" means. We don't make a big deal of it, they want to know. Still, the food is brought out with salad wedges on either side of the burger so the meal presentation is lacking from before.

Also, we asked to be moved from our original booth that was not well lit. In fact, we counted six light bulbs that needed replacement on this last Saturday out. 

I think we had been spoiled from the food and staff from a couple years ago which set such higher expectations for us. We'll still keep going here I'm sure, but what would have truly been a five-star two years ago fro this type of restaurant, is only just a three."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We were ordering drinks while waiting for our 45 minute wait table. A very rude elderly lady walked by and asked if we can shut our nephew up (he was laughing, playing on his iPad) My brother told her \"that's what kids do.\" I mean it's a family restaurant what does she expect. A few minutes later, the couple was speaking to waitress and we hear the man of the couple say \"well, they can wait outside.\" A few minutes later, we were asked to wait outside. Mind you, we were there first, already waiting 30minutes and spending money, ordering drinks without being told to leave the 30 minutes we were there. And the only reason we were asked to wait outside the bar was because a prejudice elderly couple shows up 5 minutes in and complains about my nephew having fun. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Had a less than desirable dining experience. It was 1pm on a Sunday and they were very busy but that shouldn't be an excuse.  Three times my food was brought to our table incorrectly. The second time the food was brought out by the manager and he let me know that lunch was on him. While I appreciate him comping the meal, I would much rather of had someone stop and take the time to listen to the order or pull out a pen and write it down to ensure it didn't get sent out incorrectly two more times. Everyone seemed rushed and I felt more like they were comping the meal to avoid a bad review, not because they cared at all about me as the customer or the experience I was having.  Take the time to show empathy to your diners. The server and the manager weren't rude in anyway, and I could tell they were both working very hard, I just wanted to share my thoughts."}
{"text":"Good food, especially the cheeseburgers. This location struggles with service. We are often seated, then ignored for 15 or 20 minutes because the wait staff doesn't know who has our table. 
Tonight we watched 3 tables seated after us give their orders without anyone even greeting us. Finally I walked into the kitchen and demanded they serve us. We've had wonderful service since, so it's clear the problem is with the management, not the servers"}
{"text":"The last time I visited this location, the service was amazing, but it was probably because it was late at night and we were some of the only customers there. Tonight when my boyfriend and I visited, the service was outright terrible. (Although it was more the server's fault than the restaurant itself.) Our waitress was Megan. Our appetizer took forever to come out and when we finally got it, it was obvious that it had been sitting for a long time. We also ordered more fries while we were waiting for our appetizer that we never received. When I finally got my $15 burger, it was completely overcooked and burnt even though I asked for it medium rare. By the time my burger was fixed, I didn't even want it anymore. There were multiple times throughout the dinner when we had to ask other servers or management to get our food because our server didn't check at all to see if it was ready. Basically we just wasted $60 on terrible food and a terrible evening. We will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from this Red Robin. Almost $37 for an incorrect order. Missing onion straws and sauces. Food was so-so. Don't waste your time or money. Truly disappointing!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but come on 49 cents for a side of mayo.  Yes folks you have yo pay for additional sauces now, next will be the catchup.  Burger was good but not great."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Ordered burgers, they were 'meh'.  Bottomless 'salad' looked like repurposed burger toppings.  Fries are definitely 'meh'.  Left wishing I had gone to Five Guys, Habit, Smashburger or some other burger joint instead.  Over priced, over hyped.  This may have been my last visit for good."}
{"text":"I have not been to a Red Robin since 2010 so I don't know if it's a decline in food quality or the fact that I was in high school and had no taste at the point but we visited the other day and it was meh. The server was decent and we noticed that three tables in 5 minutes were getting something comped from their bill. We weren't sure if this was the server or the restaurant but we should have paid more attention. My chicken sandwich was average, but not worth the 10.00 and my boyfriend was the least satisfied. He asked for the bottomless root beer float but instead of rootbeer he'd like coke. The server brought the rootbeer float AND a glass of coke, even after explaining, again what he wanted, no fix. Then his burger came out and he took two bites and wanted to leave. Thank god we can pay by card at our seat or we would have waited ten minutes to flag someone down. Next time I know to save the 40.00 and go elsewhere.

Oh and he asked for fresh jalapeños on his burger as that was an option and got deep fried instead. He said it was all mush and that also killed the burger."}
{"text":"This was an unexpected delight.The food exceed my expectation. The staff was very busy, but they stayed in touch to let us know we hadn't been forgotten."}
{"text":"So I am a huge Red Robin fan.  However if they don't change some of the menu items back the way they were, I may never eat here again and I've talked to quite a few others who have said the same.  Their salads used to be delicious..  That is until they changed everything about them and now they are a huge disappointment.  They are served on a long plate and are about half the size they used to be and several toppings were non-existent (like the hard boiled egg it clearly says should be on there!!). The pretzel bites, which you typically can't go wrong with were gross.  And We have always been able to order whatever salad you wanted with the soup and salad combo but not anymore apparently.  Huge let down!  Thumbs down to my latest experience.  I hope they are smart enough to listen to their customer feedback and instead of trying to cut cost and skimping on their dishes, serve what the consumer wants which ultimately leads to more consumers and more money!"}
{"text":"The service is great! All the food is amazing. The Mac and cheese burger was smaller than the others, but as only 6.99 and of course came with unlimited fries."}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars but the food was not as tasty as the one in Downtown Summerlin. We usually get the same burgers and some reason the quality was not the same. We walked in about 9:00 pm and a host didn't show up till about 2 minutes later and finally greeted us. It wasn't busy at all and had to wait for 5 minutes to get a table. Server was nice but not as attentive after order was taken. I would still go to Red Robin because I do enjoy their burgers but I wouldn't go out of my way this location."}
{"text":"After visiting this establishment last night I have to say it has turned my previous views of Red Robin around. I have had a very bad experience prior to this visit of Red Robin from small meal portions, not accurate orders and poor service but this Red Robin defies all. From the moment we walked into the door to the time we paid our check we had outstanding service. I've never had service like this from any food franchise ever the food was cooked to perfection and there wasn't anything wrong with it, the price was even reasonable. I can say because of this Red Robin alone I will be giving this business another chance. I would like to give a special thanks to Jessie for his hospitality and his professionalism while taking our order, he was clean, prompt, polite and I could go on for days about him but I'll leave it at that. 

I wish I could give this establishment more then 5 stars but unfortually it doesn't work that way, I would also like to give a special thanks to the manager who checked with us during out visit, his name was Ryan! He made sure we were satisfied with our food and didn't leave us hanging!

I ordered the BBQ Chicken Burger which was cooked to perfection and had to be one of the best tasting sandwiches I've ever had (better then my wife's but don't tell her that) my wife also ordered French Onion Soup which was awesome and she didn't have any complaints. I did take the time to indulge myself in some of their bottomless fruit drinks I believe it was the Raspberry Limeade which was Epic in itself. 

I couldn't ask for anything to go any better then it did on this visit, thanks Red Robin in South Summerlin for coming through and making it happen tonight for my appetite, I will be sending an email along with this review to your corporate office to make sure the appropriate people get their recognition!"}
{"text":"I was excited to check out this new location in downtown Summerlin and was definitely disappointed! Service was horribly slow and food was awful. I asked for pink in my burger came out well done and the server also got my order wrong. I won't be back..."}
{"text":"The only good thing I can say about this place is the Avo Salad was decent. Otherwise it was a horrible dining experience for my family. Nobody was sure what kind of beer they actually had in stock and it was all bottled. The \"gourmet \" burger we ordered was a child size if that!! Not exactly the gourmet burgers and brews place they claim to be. Lots of other better spots to try in Vegas so, I suggest skipping this one. Waste of time and money. Frowny face."}
{"text":"The food was great! I love the Royal Red Robin. The bottomless fries always prevent me from ordering dessert though, I get too full."}
{"text":"Was there 3 months ago and had horrible service. It took forever to get our food then when it finally came it was not only wrong but cold. The manager apologized and comped most of the meal. We went back tonight and had another bad experience. We got our drinks and appetizer without a problem but then sat for over 30 mins waiting for our food. The waitress came over and said they had been having kitchen trouble all day but it would be out in 2 mins. 3 mins later she sits down at another customers table chatting with them. Another lady came over and apologized and said our food should be coming. I told her it had been over 30 mins and the waitress told us 2 mins 3mins ago. She assured me it was coming and another few mins went by before our food came. Everything was cold. The fries seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time and the cheeseburgers were stone cold. I had my 2 and 4 year old children with me who were out of patience and hungry. I told the waitress after waiting that long and then getting cold food we were leaving and not paying. She rolled her eyes at me. The waitress was Francis. I am disappointed and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food. Average prices. Quality service most times."}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of Red Robin, I wish there wasn't always a wait to get in. Food is always delicious."}
{"text":"Really, do you want to pay your hard earned money for a place like this? Nothing special at all."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I been here but I had to update my review and add another star. Red Robin served BOCA burgers as Veggie/Vegan option but now they use a Quinoa and ancient grains patty and it is absolutely delicious. If you get it with salsa, avocado, romaine and lettuce bun it becomes 100% VEGAN. Now be advised they have a \"VEGAN\" menu that you can access on the menu at the restaurant via a QR Code. Here you will find that you can select Chibatta or a Whole Grain Wheat bun as an option as well. I had the bottomless Broccoli and water to wash it all down...absolutely delightful. Eat, Drink, and be Merry, my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is as good as any other Red Robin and the service is good depending on the server.  Perhaps a better hostess could handle how to seat tables and have customer service skills.

We like to come here because we have kids and it's not a quiet place. Time quoted to sit was 15 minutes. It's been 35 minutes. Over 25 people have left after eating...not one table has been sat. Are they waiting for the entire restaurant to clear before sitting anyone? There are people waiting for tables in the front. When we asked how much longer, the hostess completely YELLED... \"I'm clearing tables ok. You're not the only one here.\" Really?! Actually girl, I've been here longer than each and every person in this room. I requested the manager.

We sat down about 1 minute later....

The manager came and spoke with us again at the table. She offered to take care of an appetizer or dessert and said she sent the hostess home. I don't want to get in the way of anyone making money, but you have to learn somehow I suppose."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Sat at our table for a while, long enough for everyone to decide and turn the call server light on the games at the table before anyone said hello. When that did happen it was by our server who said she would be right with us as she turned to take the order of a 10 top. At that point I asked the hostess if we had a server who sent one over to take the others place.  We were apologized to and our order was taken. Drinks came quickly. We then sat for a good amount of time and told our table was the next out of the kitchen as 2 other tables received their food. (Don't tell customers they are next). When food did come out one of the meals was missing a third of the entre and no side and one entre did not come out at all.  3 minutes later the next entre came out and I informed the runner about the one missing items . He took it back to the kitchen. About 4 minutes later it was returned to the table. I let the server know what was happening and she said sometimes that happens when big tables come in. The manager then came over and apologized took some off of the bill and brought more sides upon request. The server then reminded us a couple of times that a portion of our bill had been removed. Fortunately I knew you can pay at the table, because we never saw our server again other then when we were leaving g and she was at the front chatting with the manager and hostess.  So I will bid good luck to this chain in a sea of restaurants competing in the area."}
{"text":"Don't go here on a Friday night, they just throw your food on your plate. Other than that it's great! 5 star allday.."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been waiting to go to Red Robin for a while and last night we arrived finally. It was definitely worth the wait. Reggie was our waiter and he was fantastic! Reggie was friendly right away and he even remembered us from a year ago! That made my husband and I feel really welcome, and we exchanged pleasantries with Reggie and he also gave me a great recommendation for my dinner. He suggested I get order the bonsai burger which has pineapple in the burger and it was absolutely delicious. We also ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer and they were so scrumptious. Red Robin is always a great restaurant to visit, the team members really work together to bring out the food at the perfect moment, thank you!"}
{"text":"Just left approximately an hour ago...should have left before ordering.  One star is being very generous.  Service was horrible. According to our receipt, Daniel was our server - and I use the term  server loosely.  I have much respect for the service industry and always try to give the benefit of the doubt in most situations.  Daniel was less than pleasant during our 2 interactions.  He paid very little attention to our order, getting it wrong.  Our food was brought out luke warm by another server.  Our \"bottomless\" beverages were never refilled."}
{"text":"The burgers at this location are so much better than any other location I've ever been to before. I like the team members, too. Although fancy-pants friends prefer the gourmet burger joints in Downtown Summerlin, I honestly think this Red Robin is better."}
{"text":"So, we come in and get seated at the bar without even being asked if we want to sit in the bar area. Mind you, we never ever drink alcohol ever. Then the waitress gives my mother 2 forks and napkins, instead of one each. It smelt musty like it had not been wiped down in awhile. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one because the manager was very nice and understanding. Glass had cabbage on it, still wet after being in dish water and hard water stains like really bad. Not good. Tells me employees are lazy. Canceled our order and left."}
{"text":"I need a nap!!!!
Went with nutjob coworkers to this Red Robin to get some grub for lunch and...
YUM!!!!!!
I had  the...Crap...Ummm, I dunno which burger but it was cooked a perfect mrare and fistfulls of french frys!!!    I'm so easy like that!!!!!

Our server Paula was spot on and certainly added to the experience that Red Robin is known for...Simple but good lunch/bar items and attentive service...

Well done!!!    Zzzzzzzzzzz....."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting. they sat me between 2 dirty tables, maybe they didn't want my business,  idk but I doubt I would return"}
{"text":"Had fast & efficient service.  Kept checking on me & refilling my drink.   Burger was melt in your mouth delicious.   Only problem was the bun fell apart.   Frys were hot and good.  Was offered more.    

Kitchen was a bit noisy & someone kept clanking plates but it became more quiet towards the end of my dinner.  

The music was nice and not too loud.    

Good experience!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome; service fast and fun. My concern is while glancing into the kitchen, there were at least 3 cooks with beards.   One man had a long unruly beard!   Isn't this a health law violation?    Even at McDonalds any server with a beard must wear a surgical mask over it."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Food came out cold and took a long time. Came here for a birthday party and quite disappointed. Atleast they took off one burger. I didn't know it was so hard to cook a grilled cheese."}
{"text":"A few friends and I went to go eat and didn't realize there was only 30 minutes to closing - rather than the staff rushing us to leave, they were kind and hospitable. The food was great and the service was even greater, our waiter Taylor did an outstanding job and we really appreciated it, definitely will come back."}
{"text":"To be honest I really enjoyed my food, but even better than the food was my server Katie! I was very surprised to be treated so well and have a server that was so sweet and really made me feel as though she was happy to be serving me. Hopefully one of the big hotel restaurants don't snatch her away, but the would be smart if they did. I left feeling like a stuffed pig but at least with a smile on my face ."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go, great food and friendly service, affordable and quality all the way round."}
{"text":"I am sitting here now! I'm only giving this place 2 stars because the waiter is nice. 
First as we walk in the door we noticed dirty tables everywhere and it isn't even that busy.
Second, we order an app and it was served with a dirty plate. When I asked for a 2nd plate that as well was dirty. I gave up and just ate with my fingers. 
Third, I ordered a chop house medium rare and got a chophouse medium well. Sigh! My husband got the A-1 burger which he thought was ok.
Over all we did enjoy the fried mushrooms and fried zucchini. The waiter was friendly and the service was fast. The water taste like tap water and the beer was good. 
I don't think id return here :("}
{"text":"Super friendly service!

I give the food a solid 3 stars and the service a 5 therefore we end up with a 4. 

We arrived at lunch time and were promptly greeted by who I presume was the manager. 

The place wasn't too busy but pretty full. This location is located inside the Galleria Mall and it is surprisingly spacious inside. 

I went with the Guacamole Burger on a jalapeño kaiser roll. You also get bottomless fries but honestly, what they serve is plenty!

The burger was ok and for the price I expected a bit more. 

I'd definitely go back and glad I popped my Red Robin cherry!"}
{"text":"We use to come here probably 4 times a month, because it is the closest to our office. We will never come here again, nor will our business meetings. The fact that we spend hundreds of dollars a month on this location that they can't bring out a couple of fries before our business partners get there is absolutely unacceptable. I don't care about a policy that was put place in the begining of 2017, when you are the only person to \"follow\" it. This is the first time I've ever put a 1 star review on any restaurant in my life, and well worth it. Once we questioned about the situation because it was new to us you just got stand offish and did not address the concerns at hand instead you reply with \"Yup.\" Or, \"That's the way it goes, what do you want for drinks.\" Sid you can not treat your customers the way you do, there is a reason why you work day-time shift during the week. Y
The funny thing about this whole situation was our team listened to a podcast about customer service and used a restaurant as an example. Look up The $6,000 Egg and you will understand what we just experienced."}
{"text":"The food was really tasty.....the service was alright. Our server seemed distracted,  but I can't even be upset about that because I completely understand!! Our food came out hot.....and the appetizer was at the table and finished before the rest of our meal arrived. The burgers were on point! We don't eat there often, but we will return."}
{"text":"Never going back!! Horrible customer service!! Had to wait to be seated when there was no one in the place. Burgers/grilled cheese weren't good..bottomless  fries my ass. It took the waiter 10 minutes to bring us refill of fries not top of forgot to bring for all of us. Had to ask 4 waiter for refill..same results. Done with Redrobin's!!"}
{"text":"I went there on a Tuesday night with a girlfriend, my husband and my 3 year old. First off they said the wait was going to be about 10 minutes, it was 30. After the long wait, they finally sat us down in the middle of the restaurant. It was so loud I couldn't even hear my girlfriend sitting next me. After another 20 minute wait, he finally took out drink orders because we were waiting so long our food orders as well. He came back only with half of our drinks and then we had to wait tell the hostess who was  the one came to give us our food, that we were missing half of our drinks. We NEVER once got a refill on on our bottomless fires cause we only saw the waiter once more and it was to give us our check.The food was okay but it wasn't with the 80 dollar check. 

I never experienced a place with worst customer service then this place. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I chose to come here as it was near my hotel.

Not having eaten any lunch, I was really looking forward to a burger and bottomless fries. As a reviewer stated, I was seated at a high table where I had to maneuver around the salt/ pepper shakers and ketchup bottle.

My server never spent more than a second of time with me. She was unwelcoming and far more concerned with what the bartender thought of her.

I had the whiskey bbq chicken and substituted pepper jack for the cheddar. It was as promised. As soon as I bit in, everything slipped and the sauce dripped everywhere. Mind you, I don't mind. I enjoyed eating it.

The fries were tasteless, almost like cardboard. Shame. I never got a second helping; couldn't motivate myself!

Oh yeah, I had to beg for a drink refill...."}
{"text":"Ordered grilled chicken and it was so rubbery that I had to send it back,  it was so disgusting. When a sandwich costs $10 I expect more.  Service was good with Laaina. We chose to sit outside so we didn't have to wait 30 minutes when half the restaurant was empty.  
Red Robin,  I don't know what's going, but the last year things have went down hill. This used to be our favorite family restaurant dining multiple times a month and now we seldom visit."}
{"text":"I'm A HUGE Red Robin Fan! !!! 
And recently I've been quite disappointed with them.  We've patronized a couple different locations and continue to be disappointed with food and terrible service.  
However this visit was different.  We were greeted by Alex our server and he made our dining experience the best!  I dined with my 2 kids and I'm a service snob, I admit it!  I've worked in the industry and have high expectations. Knowing that servers make so minimal they should be on there best game to earn your tip. if I received phenomenal service regardless of how much my bill is I will tip very generously."}
{"text":"Been here twice for dinners. First time the food and service were great. Second time was not so great. Good experiences with their chicken sandwich and garlic fries, so I'll stick with that if I ever come back to this place."}
{"text":"Bad from the minute we stepped in. The hostess was RUDE about taking down our information and insisted there was a wait. I answered her million questions and then the table was ready just as we sat down to wait! Service was not good. No silver ware, got our drinks and food orders mixed up, and it seemed like every person staff there was clueless. It is so cramped if you sit at a high top table. My burger was burnt so I only had a few bites. The waiter could tell I didn't like it so he let the cook know. As we were leaving he followed us out and gave me a $15 gift card because of the food which was nice - although I'm not sure I'll use it. I've always liked Red Robin when I travel but this one is just not cutting it."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to this location for dinner, our receipt lists the time as being 8:42 p.m. He had been to Red Robin a few times, but this was my first, and most likely my last. He hadn't had any problems the times he's been before, but everything about this visit was awful. First, we asked for a booth and we were sat way on the end by a door, and it was only a half booth, the other side were chairs... it felt a bit like being in a hallway. I used the restroom before we ordered, and it was not clean. There were two open stalls, one looked clogged, and the other one I used did not have toilet paper installed. Luckily, there was a wrapped roll elsewhere I grabbed first. One of the sinks was leaking and constantly running and there were paper towels overflowing all on the floor. When I got back we ordered water to drink, which tasted awful. By 2014, I would expect restaurants to know how important it is to people to have filtered water. Fries were brought to our table, but the server did not clear the empty tray, someone else did as they were walking by, and our \"bottomless\" fries were not refilled. We ordered, and waited. The food seemed to take a long time for what it was, and our server again, was not the one to help us. Someone else brought out our food and our server was nowhere to be found for most of the evening. She did not check in on how the food was, and I had to wait a long time for her to walk by so I could flag her down with a question. I asked if I was served the kids meal of what I ordered - I ordered the battered chicken and shrimp - which came to the table looking dismal, and quite frankly ridiculous. I have a photo I will post. It is a giant plate of fries - as if they are the main part of the entree - and just a few small pieces of chicken and shrimp tossed on to the side as if they are the garnish. It looks laughable in the photo. When I asked if this was the kids meal, she said no it was the adult size, and did not offer to bring out anything else to make it more of a meal. Both my fiance and I were flabbergasted that you would charge $12.99 + tax and tip for this - it was overcooked, the shrimp were rubbery, and quite honestly, I could have bought this at the grocery store for wayyyy less money and made it better myself. My fiance's drink ran empty most of the night, as did his fries. We waited for our check to come, and the only time our server came back quickly to the table was to collect our money and her tip. Overall it was one of the worst eating-out experiences I've ever had... The chicken was half the size of the chicken strips at Applebee's, just an FYI, and they charge about half what you charge... they are double the size there and they serve it with three pieces."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Manager John was just awful, told me I was wrong the menu was wrong too. Tried to charge me more for garden burger substitute instead of meat. Clearly states in menu no charge. According to John red robins menu and I are wrong. How rude. Then to top it off after telling John the manager and our waitress to cook well done order. It was wrong. Hopefully red robin addresses this to him or there will be a lot more unhappy customers."}
{"text":"For a chain it's a good casual decently priced burger place. I stopped in with two friends after a day prepping and painting walls and we had a nice time. Our server was friendly and quickly corrected any issues we had (mushrooms on the poutine when we asked for none, incorrect bill, dirty to-go boxes). One issue might be too many for some, but when you're with good company eating good food your mindset is more relaxed. 

I got the Mad Love Burger $14.49 with coleslaw as my side. I enjoyed my food and love that you can get sides that aren't french fries plus the side is bottomless so if you want more you can get more. I also tried the poutine and it was decent, not spectacular, but if you're hungry it works just fine. My friends seemed to enjoy their food as well (a burger and mac & cheese). 

There are several options for burgers in Rocky River, you can go the fast food route with places like McDonald's, or mom and pop like Bearden's, or more \"fancy\" like Flipside. I think Red Robin is a solid middle choice that appeals to everyone from families to people looking to get the most for their money to those who need something casual and reliable for dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped here around lunch time the other day for a co-workers birthday and I'll have to say Red Robin reminds me why I try to stay away from chain restaurants.  I decided to order the Prime Rib Dip and my co-workers got burgers and salads. The food seemed to take forever to come out, and when it finally did it was meh/okay - neither great nor terrible. If you order the fries make sure you get them crispy otherwise they come out like limp squishy sadness. I could describe the food in more detail but meh really sums it up the prime rib dip. Oh and make sure you get everything you ordered; I was supposed to get coleslaw with my meal but it never came even when I asked the waiter about it. Our server was okay, nice but not exceptionally personable or attentive as we had to ask for refills on our waters, extra napkins (am I the only person who uses more than one napkin?), there's that whole missing part of my meal thing, and overall the service was just slow. 

Again, this place isn't awful, but I have definitely experienced better. Probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice now and I had to finally write something about this particular red robin.  Being from California , there were a couple of them around us and we frequented them many times.  I have to say , the red robin here in Vegas , is a let down.   

The service has been great both times we have come here , friendly staff and even the manager has come by to chat with us both times as well. This is fine and dandy , but service needs to be good along with the food , and that's where i had to lose some points on. 

The first stop i ordered the new \"special\" which is the big bacon burger. I asked for BBQ sauce on the side , medium cooked burger.  My wife ordered the patty melt well done ...    When we received the burgers , they were opposite.  My wife received the medium and i received the well done.  We could have sent them back , but at that point we just wanted to eat ( we had an appointment to get to ).  The well done burger for me... had way to much char flavor. 

The second time my wife ordered the same thing , well done again ... came out medium.  The place was packed and it took quite a while to get our food , so once again sending it back was not an option. 
I was not in the mood for a burger that night so i tried the fish and chips along with a side of their clam chowdah ! .  The chowdah! was actually quite tasty , thick and had nice sized chunks of clams in it.   4 star . 
However the fish .....  dry , tasteless , and the breading was not fully cooked through.  I was disappointed.   

I may give these guys one more chance on my birthday (next month ) for my free burger ... but i haven't decided yet."}
{"text":"Not impressed! Waitress was mediocre at best, she never asked if we needed refills or ask how our meal was. When we were seated the table was sticky and the menu had food crumbs in it. I had the fish and chips served with a mini cup of tarter sauce about enough for 1 fish. The breading was burnt in multiple spots and we were seated at a table that looked like it was strategically placed at the entry way into the dining room so everyone coming or going walked past our table. Was happy when we were done eating just to get out of there! I will not be back. Server was Bethany."}
{"text":"The service is decent, but the food leaves a lot to be desired. You can get a better burger, with exactly what you want on it, for a little less money at Fuddruckers a half mile west of here. You won't have a server to bring your burger and have to apply your own toppings, but that's a better setup in my opinion plus there is nobody to tip!"}
{"text":"Sadly, there's only one thing consistently good at this place - the parmesan garlic fries (extra crispy)... the burgers are hit and miss - and that's just a shame.  Last night I tried the ghost chili sauce + jalapeno burger, and if I hadn't added bacon to it, I wouldn't have been able to finish.  Bland, flavorless, and greasy.  Just go somewhere else for a burger, for the love of cow."}
{"text":"My daughter, granddaughter,great granddaughter and I went for lunch. We were seated quickly, bunt everything went downhill from there. First no one checked to see if we had enough utensils for each of us.  The onion rings arrived. Delicious. Our order taken. After a wait that seemed a little long, but not to bad. My granddaughters order was not delivered.  Upon notifying our server she informed us someone else had picked up the order. We waited, waited, waited. After the rest of us were finished with lunch the missing lunch arrived. Our server apologized but kept saying it wasn't her fault. My great granddaughter wanted their donuts as dessert.  Waiting game began anew. I asked the busboy if he could get the manager for me, who never did come to talk to me. The donuts arrived, no cinnamon & sugar on them. And they were extra greasy. At this time I could see our server go to the manager with a long conversation. ( she had observed that I asked for the manager), I repeat, who I never did meet. We were comped $15.00 , off our large order, but the lunch with my loved ones was less than pleasant. Yes  I tipped minimally because I didn't want the busboy to be punished for the servers bad attitude and inefficient service."}
{"text":"Take the kids out for dinner. ..it'll be fun they said...how bad can it be with 4 kids they said....This place is always busy. The food is really good and the prices are not that bad. If you go when they are really busy the service is going to be sub-par. Also I recommend ordering extra fries as soon as you get your food otherwise the bottomless fries do not really make it back to your table before it is time to leave."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Our waitress was very nice. I love their fries and love even more that they are bottomless. They would have gotten 5 stars but I swallowed a lemon seed that was hiding on the bottom of peach tea and i think its still stuck in my throat. LOL"}
{"text":"I miss the days when Garlic Fries were what you were automatically served. But since I loved them so much I don't mind paying the $1.50/$2.00 upcharge. I placed an order for pickup and one fry had the privilege of being graced by the garlic I ordered. ONE FRY! Literally. Come on Red Robin!"}
{"text":"No matter what or how me times u tell them they will still mess your order up sad you gotta got to the east Red Robin for a decent burger The monona one fell off hard"}
{"text":"Wow has this location gone downhill. Went about a month ago, and the place was in the process of a renovation and just seemed dirty.  (Child's seat was disgustingly sticky...) Service was fine, albeit slow for the type of restaurant.  Food was serviceable.  Prices were up from previous visits and the serving of fries smaller (which doesn't make a difference since they'll bring you more, but suggests an attempt to cost-contain).  We're unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here on a snowy Monday.  Not very busy, but that was not surprising considering the conditions outside.  We were promptly seated, and our waitress was at our table quickly.

Food - you go to a Red Robin because the food is pretty consistent.  Decent burgers and great fries & onion rings.  This meal didn't disappoint.

The X-factor with chain restaurants is the service.  I've had some poor experiences because of this, but our service here was excellent.  Food came out quickly to our table, refills were provided without asking, and the check came before I had to ask.

Comparatively,  Red Robin isn't a 4-star restaurant, but for delivering on my expectations, they've earned it on this visit."}
{"text":"New restaurant that just opened up. Usually very crowded and always a wait time. Their burgers are good. However, I got a salad the next time I went and it was pretty good. The garlic fries are an absolute must!! (99 cents more). 
I rated 3 stars because their service was really slow. 1 lady maintaining the bar and the bar area was pretty full. She was our waitress. We continually had to ask (whenever a waiter/waitress came by) for this and that because they forgot it. Someone, I believe a manager, asked my husband if he wanted a refill on his drink, and he said yes. My husband waited about 10 minutes for it and we saw the guy twice before our waitress got it. 
Food is good, but the service definitely needs some improvement."}
{"text":"Despite Red Robin being a chain, they provide a fun atmosphere and really good food.  It is a nice place to go for a reasonably priced meal and some great burgers.

While the burgers at Red Robin are not on the level of the top places in Pittsburgh, they are well above average compared to other chains.  The burgers are fresh and cooked to your liking.  The A1 Peppercorn burger has been one of my favorite burgers for a very long time.  The onion strings, peppercorn sauce, and onion bun are a great combination that always leaves you wanting more.  Each burger also comes with bottomless fries which is a nice touch.  I also really enjoy their appetizers.  Their mozzarella sticks are some of the best around."}
{"text":"This our absolute go to place for a bite to eat! Love love love this place! Amazing whiskey river BBQ sandwiches and guacamole burger. Servers are friendly. Wait time for food a bit slowish but not too bad. Courtney the server is awesome! She's our favorite! Super nice and charming and treats you like a friend:)))"}
{"text":"There is NO reason a Monday trip to a half-empty Red Robin should take 2 HOURS! 

We arrived and were seated.  20 minutes later a waitress took our order. 10 minutes later we got our drinks. 30 minutes later, my daughter's kids meal came out. 15 more minutes and our food finally arrived.

The food itself was fine, but trying to enjoy a meal with an antsy toddler who had at that point been strapped in a highchair for over an hour was near impossible.

If you have time to burn, enjoy.  
Dining with kids? Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great. Experience today. Wait time was nothing, food was hot and fresh, and service was excellent. Jack was awesome. He was prompt with taking our order, starting beverages right away and regularly checking on us. I even appreciate another waitress refilling my daughters drink as soon as it was empty.  Worth the stop."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Waited at least 15 minutes before a server greeted us, our waters were empty most of the night and my food came out wrong and the fries cold. Both our plates were taken back and remade but it tasted horrible. You would think they would take someone having a severe food allergy a little more serious. Our server checked on us once the whole night to fill up our waters right after we had already paid. I'm a server so I'm not being mean, I just know how you should treat your guests. The only good part of the night was having my food taken off the bill. I will not be back."}
{"text":"To me, Red Robin isn't all that and it's not good food.. just mediocre. Over the years I've probably had twenty different items from here, and none of them stood out to me.. they just aren't what they used to be. I think Red Robin was amazing 10 years ago but I think it fell off in terms of service and food quality. Hope I never have to go back unless I'm forced"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Had higher hopes. Staff and server was very friendly. Food was not good at all. We order nachos and they forgot to put the main ingredient chili on. We had better burgers at fast food places. Three kids gave it a thumbs down. Was our first trip and will be our last."}
{"text":"We've been to this location twice and, all things considered, its pretty good.  Service was friendly, fash, and efficient each time. Burgers were good (I one outing I had the standard Red Robin burger, which was fine, but on my second visit I had the royal red robin (which comes with bacon, egg, and cheese).  I enjoyed both, although the royal red robin burger was really excellent (my wife had this both times).  As usual the fries are also a highlight here, especially when coupled with their special french fry seasoning.  Its outstanding."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 5 stars, but the hostess' were all very rude and short. You can tell just by looking at them they hate their jobs and would rather be somewhere else. Not only that but everyone was getting seated out of order lots of parties of 2 or 3 so not much variation in size and no excuse why someone who just walked in gets seated before someone who has waited their 15-20min. 

Other than that our waitress was amazing and our food was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"It's changed a lot since the first time I went a long while ago at least to this location, wayyyyy before I started yelping. 

I guess they're trying to class it up a bit? The burgers and fries used to come in baskets but now they come on a plate which is cool but it's whatever to me. They'll still always be the same in my mind! But really we're here for the food....or at least some of us are.

I decided to try the guacamole burger, minus the bacon (I don't do bacon, sorry!), and substituted mayo for chipotle aioli sauce and the regular burger for a gardein burger. So the subbing the burger for a vegetarian or vegan (they got those too) option was no charge....subbing the mayo for chipotle aioli was $0.50, it would be no big deal if there was actual sauce and if they asked me if it was okay/told me there would be a charge for subbing it. I tasted practically nothing but saw a smudge on the bottom of the burger. I'm not too happy about that. Not to mention the guacamole was a puree and well you could hardly tell it was there either. So this burger was a big bust for me and a serious disappointment. 

Bottomless steak fries? I can always go for fries! They tasted the same as I always remembered. Nothing too special about them, I like it with a little bit more of their seasoning so thankfully they leave a bottle of that on the tables! 

I rarely get dessert while I'm out eating dinner because I always over stuff myself, but this time I decided to treat myself and wished I didn't.

I got a the red velvet cake. Normally you get a rich cream cheese icing with a moist cake. Well I got a dried cake that tasted like it was a couple days old not to mention left out all day and the rich cream cheese icing tasted nothing like cream cheese icing that I know. So I was doubly disappointed.

They also ran out of all the seasonal taps that night but had one IPA on tap that I decided to try. It had a goose on it, I forgot the name, but I liked it. Nothing too special about this beer though. 

I'm not a fan of being sat at by the bar, but that's where they put me and so I dealt with it. Next time I'm going to the Eastern location even if it's a bit farther from me. I think I'm a bit too disappointed with this visit to go back here."}
{"text":"Good place to get a decent burger. I haven't had something I didn't like, but I really come here for the freckeled lemonade and bottomless fries more so than the burgers! I don't know why but I was hooked on their seasoning for the fries! 

They usually have my favorite beers on tap depending on the season, Sam Adams seasonal. Which is another addd bonus. I don't usually come here during Happy Hour but when I do, I switch out the lemonade for the beer! 

I haven't had bad service here yet and they're pretty quick, even when I was with a party of 10. All of us ended up getting freckeled lemonade and we cleaned them out of glassware! Didn't know that was possible, we were quite entertained by it. 

My only real complaint is that if you don't pick your times right, you'll find yourself in a very loud resturant with a lot of children who don't behave. Some screaming and yelling around like they're the only ones there. I love children but not when they're misbehaving out in public places ._.;; Otherwise it's a great place to just chill with friends"}
{"text":"Honestly, the service here was excellent. I can't complain at all. Our server was on the ball, right there ready and available for refills with a genuine smile on her face. The Whiskey River Burger she recommended was filling and good. The games provided kept the kids entertained. And yeah, Red Robin have the hookup on/around your birthday, which is way cool. I don't always hit up chain restaurants, but when I do, it's Red Robin."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, Red Robin is usually one my favorite ones. However, our experience in this one left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and not from the food.

You see, Red Robin has an eClub, of which I'm a member. As an eClub member, you receive a free gourmet burger of your choice the week of your birthday. I make sure to take advantage of that offer on an annual basis. It's my birthday and I made sure to let my server know this, then proceed to order a gourmet burger of my choice. Well, the gourmet burger I ordered was a new item on the menu. I ate it and enjoyed it thoroughly (tender, juicy, and flavorful). Then I get my bill at the end. It wasn't free...

I asked my server why, to which she then informed me that this particular gourmet burger was not part of the birthday deal. Huh, well that's nice to know...after the fact. It seems that when I made it very clear that it was my birthday, instead of telling me then that this burger was not included, she let me order it thinking, \"bigger bill, bigger tip\", but who can know for sure. All I know is that it sucks when you feel you've been mislead. 

Burger, great. Experience, not good."}
{"text":"Ok Ok as far as the food goes it gets 3 stars....not bad but it wasn't earth shattering. The 5 star rating was for Samantha, our delightful and awesome server. 

She was so kind to my monkeys by bringing them balloons (only after my daughter went potty...she's kind of afraid of the toilet flushing), their food first, offering us more crayons, gave my daughter sprite for her upset tummy. It made me and my friend's lunch so much nicer. I hope her manager reads this because she is what makes me want to visit Red Robin again. Keep up the good work Samantha!"}
{"text":"The service is getting worse and worse here. It takes at least 25-30 mins to get a table on the weekends and another 15-20 before your food arrives. Plus unlike most Red Robins they don't bring a plate of fries while you wait and when you do get your order they only give you a half order of fries. The only reason I still give it 3 stars is because the food is still good, as long as you can wait 40-50 mins. Make sure to proactively ask for fries while you wait for your food, the waiters/waitress won't offer it and they won't offer to bring more out unless you ask, which I find different than most Red Robins I've been to."}
{"text":"Burgers are usually really good, love the endless fries, and they have tons of different sauces to choose from! Plus we've never had bad customer service. Great job, Red Robin!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love Red Robin. If my husband had a choice on where we went he would always pick RR. We order the onion tower and burger. Always great with the bottomless fries. Employee are friendly."}
{"text":"Great food along with a great server. We had a big group with 2 little kids. She helped make sure the kids comfortable. She was very kind to all of us. It was an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Worked our faces off all weekend getting ready for summer at my job. My SBL(sexy bearded lover) even came to my work and helped for several hours. Of course we live in AZ and of course it was a hundred million degrees. All we could think of today was how tasty a cold brew and a beautiful burger sounded...which in turn landed us at Red Robin... yumm. We were greeted by a fellow nerd who enjoyed PHX Comicon as much as we did, and he hooked us up with the comfy red chair table.
I love sitting in those chairs.
SBL ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the Southern Comfort burger. I may be making the name of that burger up, but it was so good it was stupid! Was it because we worked so hard and we're thirsty like walking through the Sahara with a Dixie sized cup of water? I'm gonna go with no because everything we ordered was made with love. We also ordered the chips, salsa and guacamole for an appetizer. Super good, but the only thing was it came with like a chip. So for future reference just order the feee extra refill when you put in your initial order. (Then you will have 2 chips, one for you and one to share;) Our service was lovely and our tummies were satisfied. Overall it was a happy dining experience. 
PS.We didn't remember RR being as pricey as it was was, but we're chalking it up to the cosmetic lift to the joint. It's funny how things turn gourmet overnight."}
{"text":"Red Robin.....Yuck!   Way overpriced for the quality of food. Service is questionable at times.  Food always take forever to get to your table. I have literally watched my food just dieing in the window. They only reason I go there is because my daughter loves the place. Good atmosphere to take gets, just not a descent meal."}
{"text":"This Red Robin location has ample parking available and also has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. It's a nice spot to visit when you need a vegan burger and you are dining with friends who eat meat. Order the keep it simple hugger and the fruit or broccoli and you are all set! Sometimes I forget about this option but I am always glad it's available."}
{"text":"This was your average Red Robin. Nothing good or bad to say. The service was pretty good. Food was average. I enjoyed loads of free refills on my limeade."}
{"text":"The server wasn't that great!! They messed up my order they took it of my bill and I got a salad to go because I had lost my appetite then I get home and the dressing for the Southwest salad wasn't in the bag! I have to say Kristy the manager was very good at trying to make things right!!"}
{"text":"New experience with my daughter's allergies. 2 thumbs up. If you have allergies, Red Robin is a great place to go."}
{"text":"We have been to Red Robin a few times. Some times service is great, some times it is not.
Some times the food has been great some times the food hasn't been good at all. 
Pretty much they are not very consistent...
But today I was VERY disappointed with Red Robin. We have a toddler and a two week old newborn. If you are a parent; when you go out you want things to go as smooth as possible. So we decided to bring the stroller, so I could rock the stroller and put baby to sleep if need so to be. 
The place was not busy, it was pretty empty. So we walk in and the first thing they say is \"oh you can't have a stroller inside, you can leave it up here but you cannot take it to the sitting area. I simply ask \"why?\". Their answer was that the space was reduced, but they could put one of those slings for the car seat. 
This made me upset, because the things that hold the car seats there are the same size as our stroller. Also if they don't have a lot of people why is it a big deal. This doesn't make it a kid friendly place to me. Therefore I will not be returning to Red Robbin. I have two kids!"}
{"text":"I usually like Red Robin.  Normally the food is good and portions are huge.  This was my first time at the Happy Valley location.  The service was fine.  This single star rating is for the food.

I got the Prime Rib sandwich and it was incredibly small.  There was almost no meat on it.  The sandwich was over $13.  I don't know if they've decreased their portion size or what, but I would never have expected that from Red Robin.

I would not recommend this place.  However, I might eventually try another Red Robbin."}
{"text":"I tried a fried egg on my hamburger and OMG it was goooood . They have amazing sweet potato fries and they are bottomless as well.  They also have tasty dips for the fries!  I'm totally going back!"}
{"text":"We're here at red Robin and haven't been for quite a few years. When we walked in and immediately felt like we put the hostess out of her way by asking for a table. As were looking around right now, the staff is completely down in the mouth. The moral is horrible. Service is very slow.  Musics to loud so, it makes the customers yell. Foods pretty good though. Ask for crispy fries so the don't drown them in oil and make them soggy."}
{"text":"I should have known not to order seafood at a burger restaurant. I tried the Red Robin favorite - Fish and Chips- and it was not my favorite at all. My least favorite in fact that I can remember in a long while. The fish was bland and dry and oily. Probably frozen then fried. Other people in my party tried the burger and tortilla soup and they said it was just ok. Service was super slow. The best food here are the bottomless steak fries, but you will have a bottomless wait for them. They were served very slowly in small batches so you are never really satisfied and always asking for a refill. I recommend not to eat here and stick to the beer."}
{"text":"Great place if you want a regular or a gourmet burger their entrées are also good very relaxed feeling service is great as well some of the waitresses but most are very friendly"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and every time, the service seemed very slow...

Looks like there's plenty of people moving about but no service was being given. The food wasn't too bad. The bottomless fries were fine. Once I even substituted for bottomless broccoli. Of all the typical burger places with this kind of atmosphere, this place can do better.

Last time, I ordered a Chili Chili Burger and there was barely any chili on it even though on the menu, it was painting an image of a lot of chili on this awesome hamburger. Turns out, it was just a hamburger. :/"}
{"text":"I'm starting to like their burgers better. It's not the best burgers in the world but it's not bad either. Throw in unlimited fries and the deal seems pretty good.

Service was not bad and the place seemed clean. I had the burger with the blue cheese and straw onion rings! I give that a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Jason was our waiter and we had the best time with the whole family, talk about being funny and such a great attitude, when your in the neighborhood and want a bite to eat ask to be seated at Jason's table, I guarantee you won't regret it. Great service and great food! Thank you Jason for the great service~"}
{"text":"Called on my lunch break not COOL Red Robin I was on hold 15+ mins STILL did not receive help another co-worker actually called and was helped BEFORE I was answered. YES this happened today, it was not your A game or even your B game."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED for the last time at this location.
I love Red Robin. I eat here probably once a month. The other evening my fiancé and I came in for dinner, and surprisingly it wasn't packed like we expected. Our waitress was absolutely terrible. I don't know if she was having a bad day or what, but she took forever to bring us our drinks, forgot to bring us plates for our appetizers (even reminded herself and still forgot), checked on us maybe ONCE the entire time.... just awful. She was catering to other customers (we assume), but she would completely walk past our table every time we saw her. A younger boy who I guess helps bring out the food was more prompt than her. He brought us extra fries, napkins, even checked on us to see how we were doing! We ended up tipping him and just left her a few dollars. I understand if you're having a bad night, you may be off your game, but holy shit at least come by and let us know you're busy, if that's even the case. Oh and another thing- the manager took his time going to every table to ask how their meal was, except for us. Is it because we are a younger couple? Honestly I have noticed since we are in our late 20's, we receive shit service. Regardless of age, we are respectful, easy going, tip generously, but I guess that's not enough. I will definitely continue to dine in at Red Robin, but never again at this location."}
{"text":"The bar area is now a drag to eat in.
Tables are way to close. 
When I dine out, I prefer to be with my friends and family, not everyone else in the place!
Bad move RR, you just lost us as customers, and I'm sure lots more!"}
{"text":"Went for the soft open and it was fantastic! Super attentive, knowledgeable staff, hands on management and of course most importantly fresh, hot, delicious food! We will definitely be back and soon! The donuts and freckled lemonade were huge hits with the whole table and all of the burgers were great."}
{"text":"Went here  yesterday night. I was craving for a nice burger and steak fries, but was disappointed at the end. Burger was on point, but the bottomless fries advertisement was disappointing :-( at the first you get some fries with the burger, then waiting on more fries with the rest of the costumers sad!!! I couldn't wait cause I was going to the movies right after dinner. So for the price of the meal and service it was a 3 star experience."}
{"text":"Brianna was our server and she was so unbelievably sweet. If there was a way I could give her 5 stars and not this place, I would. 
Red Robin has totally lost me as a customer. I've come here for years and always get the Whiskey River BBQ burger. 
My partner gets the Royal Red Robin.... and boy was it not royal at all. When it arrived at our table first, it had mustard which we specifically asked for it not to be on there. We waited so long to get a replacement for it. 
We also waited the time of it being ordered and replaced for a milkshake. 
The cleanliness of this place was horrendous. I watched two managers sit at tables with customers and walk around where a bunch of trash is, constantly... and no one did anything about it. They didn't pick it up or ask someone to. (See pictures) 
I even watched customers come in and have to ask to switch booths because the one they were being sat at was dirty.
Red Robin really needs to get their stuff together. Brianna you were great and very sweet. You attended to all of our needs."}
{"text":"It was a first I bought a beer, she dumped it on me& then still charged me for it even after she apologized and said she wasn't going to charge me I couldn't gt it taken off my bill cuz I consumed it?. Ive never heard of consuming a beer through your spine!! Food was alright but every time I come here it's the worst experiences anyone could have. Five times here five bad experiences...Really wish they can gt it together!! But I'm never coming back!!"}
{"text":"I ate here on Tuesday evening. I got food poisoning that night. Never going here again. I wouldn't be surprised if they give leftover fries as part of there bottomless fries option."}
{"text":"On March 7 my husband and I arrived at Red Robin around 6:15pm understanding there would be a wait as it is a Saturday night. Upon arriving a host was holding the door for other patrons and just as we approached he walked in and did not hold the door for us as well. We got inside and put our name on the list and were given the estimated wait time of 30-35 minutes. After waiting for about half an hour a party of four sat themselves at a table on the patio. We waited an additional 10 minutes before giving up. In that 10 minutes the party of four that seated themselves had received menus, drinks, and fries. After this experience we do not plan on going to this location again."}
{"text":"It's a burger chain. The waiter was a bit aloof, and it took him awhile to bring our drinks and take the food order.

I had the royale burger. It was a decent burger, although the egg was over medium when I requested over easy. The burger was cooked properly (medium). It was fairly juicy and tender, which was certainly a plus. 

The bottomless fries were average. I would have liked them to be a bit more crispy, but they weren't too \"limp\" like some places. When I requested a second basket of fries, it took him awhile. I was already done with my burger at that point.

For dessert, I had the mud pie. This was very good and absolutely huge!! I really enjoyed it, as I am a big fan of chocolate.

Overall, what you would expect. Quite a few inconsistencies and below average service. Average food."}
{"text":"The worst burgers ever documented as special.   There is no pink,  there is no special,  this is Dennys budget burger house,  and pretty bad advertisements and lies about special burgers."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for sure. A big star came off because our waitress managed to confuse french onion soup with clam chowder and then basically was confused when we told her it wasn't what we ordered.

Red Robin has a great selection of burgers and chicken sandwiches and their Vegan/Veggie alternatives are adequate for even the pickiest eaters. The bottomless fries with multiple dipping sauces is a great touch and the burgers are juicy and delicious. My only gripe with the burger itself is that it was way too messy and basically fell apart in my hands. Not sure if it was the soggy bun or the 2 lbs of sauce dripping out but it was an inconvenience and happens every time I eat here.

If you are looking for a highly priced, tasty burger Red Robin is definitely a good choice but there are plenty of places for less money that are much better in Las Vegas. Create in Summerlin still ranks much higher on my list."}
{"text":"The Only good things r burgers, fries & bottled beer
Spicy boneless wings were prob froz Tyson rolled in sauce
Queso, yuck.  
Chicken ceasar wrap, eh.."}
{"text":"I'm relieved I waited and tried Red Robin again. My first experience, at this location, was right after they opened and, frankly, I couldn't see the big deal.

This time, however, was much better.

This time I chose the bruschetta chicken sandwich, fries, and coleslaw.

Bruschetta sandwich - 4 with a 1 star deduction for sogginess in the bottom half of the bun.  Coleslaw - 5 since who knew adding stone ground mustard to a very traditional coleslaw recipe would make that much difference.  Unfortunately, the famous Red Robin fries only rate a generous 2 since, for my money, French fries should have some crispness and these were too thick and lacked the desired crisp surface.  But the thing that really draws the overall rating down was the service. The restaurant didn't seem particularly busy, but it was a long time from ordering to service and then the server disappeared when it was time to ask for the check and again when the cash was available. I finally flagged down a different server and paid the bill.  This resulted in a 1 deduction in the rating.

I guess I could have used the ubiquitous tabletop credit card terminals but I don't like them and I tend to deduct from the server's tip when the gadget does some of the work"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after hearing rave reviews. This place seriously has the best burgers around! Will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  Monica did a great job taking care of us

Sautéed Shroom Burger is UH-MAZING!"}
{"text":"Always get good service. I love there food and drinks. The staff is friendly the price is reasonable with bottomless fries and drinks."}
{"text":"Visiting from California and this was by far one of the best services and food we've received.

Our server Lauren went over and beyond. We add multiple items and was happy to sever us. The runner was also polite when she brought our items. 

Thanks Red Robin. We will definitely return when we visit AZ."}
{"text":"Honestly, I had a really decent experience here. Came in on a Monday afternoon. Sat at the bar. Good draft beer selection. Beer was cold. Service was great. Food came out on time. Burger was cooked perfectly. Drinks were refilled timely. I usually have at least a couple things to complain about, but not today."}
{"text":"Horribly slow service, we only saw our server once to drop off the check.  My husband and I wanted a quick weekday lunch as we had to get back to our jobs, food and service were slow an my husband waited 15 minutes for a refill on his fries.  Food is descent but not worth the horribly slow service and kitchen, plenty of better burger places in the area.  I would prefer my money go to businesses that take interest in their customers and don't provide horribly slow service."}
{"text":"It's nice here had the bbq wings friendly staff. 
Every time I come to Robbins I skip the burgers even though it's their thing.  Out in the what where of nowhere right now for work training it's a welcome place to eat."}
{"text":"Good food. Good selection. Friendly employees. Menu items a little pricey. Great  shakes & onion rings."}
{"text":"Decent food. There are definitely better places in the Valley to get a burger, especially in the $9 price range, and especially since the rarest they will cook one is with just a little pink. However, this is a good place to go with a group, and you can't beat the bottomless fries (try the garlic fries). Service when we've been here has ranged from outstanding to pretty slow just depending on the night (and possibly the size of our group)."}
{"text":"Many thanks to Justin, Jonathan, and the whole crew for great service and an awesome selection of deliciously prepared meals to celebrate my and my daughters birthdays tonight!!! -the corner booth"}
{"text":"I dont mind Red Robin. I'm a sucker for carbs, so the bottomless fries win me over every time.

This visit, I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger- burger, bbq sauce cheddar cheese, crispy onion straws, lettuce, tomatoes & mayo. I found it to be really good. They also had the same choice with a grilled chicken sandwich 

Bobby ordered the Prime Chophouse Burger which looked delicious. I can't remember what my sister had for dinner, but she ordered French Onion Soup beforehand. I tried the soup- very good! Sometimes not all French onion soup is tasty! 

For drinks, I ordered \"Sand in Your Shorts. It had  Chambord, vodka, Peach Schnapps, Midori, triple sec, o.j., cranberry juice & sweet 'n sour. It was tasty, not very strong though. My sister ordered a frozen strawberry margarita & Bobby ordered Reb Robin's version of a Long Island.. I forget the name :)

Next time I'm going to order a Bottomless Root Beer Float. I'm pretty sure those are the most amazing 4 words that a can be next to each other in a sentence."}
{"text":"Normally I enjoy Red Robin...for what it is; a chain burger place that gives you that \"flare\" vibe Office Space so beautifully made apparent. But unfortunately this particular location sooks. Service is sub-par and the food both times we came by was either delivered super late or burnt :/. I don't think we will return since we did give it two shots. I do get that they are the only one nearby but no excuses in my opinion. Not good. Sorry kind staff at RR."}
{"text":"Honestly the best service I've received. We waited a while to sit down so we decided to sit at the bar. We sit down and immediately the server got our drinks. So we get our drinks and started looking at the menu and he came up on my side and was describing all the food category they were serving. Seriously he had the best customer service Farley with a F at the bartender, and then to top it off the food is amazing! 5 stars & HIGHLY recommend you try this place. Thank you so much for the great food and excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Awfully pricey. We both had their French onion soup. The best part was the bread and cheese. The broth watery and tasteless. We also had the fish and chips. However the fish had a puddle of oil under it. Very greasy but aside from that the fish itself was flavorful. The fries crispy. Between the two of us. Each with the same order was nearly 50 dollars together!  Not a fan. The wait staff was very good though. Nicky was an excellent attentive server."}
{"text":"This was our first time going to this location Red Robin. I normally order the chili chili cheeseburger and am super satisfied. But this time I decided to see what else they had to offer, reading the prime Chophouse Burger had me drooling, I had to order it, and my boyfriend ordered the southern burger?  We also ordered two freckled lemonades and zucchini sticks with cheese curds as appetizer.
Both burgers were extremely bland...
Our server barely came to the table and never asked us how the food was, we waited for her to come by and she never did, so we just paid on the computer and left."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice this past month, it is honestly a hit or miss. First time we were sat fairly quickly by the bar and our server was awesome, corrected mistakes and went beyond. 
This second time we walked in, three servers were by the bar chatting away, looked over and saw us and didn't come greet us, just continued chatting away while looking around for the host, the host saw us and we finally got sat. Our server came and greeted us and took our orders, but forgot to ask how we wanted our burgers cooked. Our burgers came after watching them sit on the kitchen window getting cold, (couldn't even return them because our server didn't come and check on us and we were starving) then our sweet potato fries didn't come til after we were done with our meal and once again those were cold as well because they were sitting up on the kitchen window. Our server didn't apologize once, or ask if everything was okay and the chipotle aioli and ranch I ordered didn't come til I asked another server for it... Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"Wonderful service provided by Austin. Find him, he is the best. Thank you Austin, twice we have had you as our server twice now and each time its been wonderful."}
{"text":"I went here in June for my birthday. The burgers are excellent. It came medium well which was exactly what I ordered. The customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"Due to poor service in the past, we usually go to the Chandler location; even though we live up the street from this Tempe location. Today's experience was noticeably better. Moriah was extremely attentive to every detail. She made sure our drinks were filled, the food was perfect and we are glad we sat in her area today. Great job."}
{"text":"I guess the food was what is to be expected from a Red Robin or similar chain. I ordered the avocado bacon burger. I though the burger resembled something you would get from a fast food restaurant. It was pretty thin. I like that they have a gluten free bun. That's what made me add a third star. To be honest, the gluten free bun was the star of the meal. It was quite tasty for gluten free. My daughter scarfed down her mac and cheese, she said it was great. My sons cheese pizza looked pretty good, it's actually more of a loaf with sauce and cheese on it. The server was great. My daughters steak fries seemed a bit undercooked. 

I'm not sure that I would go back to Red Robin. Reminds me of the kind of place you go as a teenager when nothing else is open or you are too young to get in anywhere else. I prefer ZinBurger for a burger."}
{"text":"Burgers are great but its expensive. Sometimes when we went, despite only a handful of customers we sat for 30+ minutes waiting for a waitress, they are too busy talking to each other. For the money and time In and Out is a better choice."}
{"text":"Who would think I'd get fantastic Fish & Chips at a burger joint??!!! But, I did! I took a chance since I wasn't in the mood for a burger like the rest of my party--and I'm glad I did! Delicious, crisp, perfectly fried coating and thick, white fish pieces--no \"fishy taste\" whatsoever! Very fresh tasting! I'm impressed! This will be my choice from now on! Everyone was satisfied with their burgers and grilled chicken salad as well! The fries were lukewarm and limp--but that fish made them tolerable! Our waitress was very courteous and efficient--very nice girl! Now, the reason I didn't give five stars? The \"hostess WITHOUT the mostess \"! Terrible personality, not friendly and welcoming as a hostess SHOULD be! We almost turned around and walked out. I tried being friendly and she just glared at us. You know her, the miserable one with the strawberry blond hair. Yeah, you need to lose her or lose customers. Other that her, great experience and great food. Apps are very overpriced, but we'll be back for the fish and burgers!"}
{"text":"Just had an excellent meal with my wife and son at the South Hills Village location. I've only visited a few of these restaurants, but every time I do- I'm surprised by the quality and amount of food for which I pay.

Our server was quick to respond to every request, and the decorations were great conversation starters. For example, if you sit right by the kitchen doors, which I know is typically a bad idea for ambiance, you will get to see a contrast of different artwork. I was greeted by a print of the well-known classic painting, 'American Gothic' & and an adaptation with Lego figurines.

The 'Mile High Mud Pie' is a great desert to cap off your meal too.

This place is definitely a good choice among the available fare in this area."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. We had the cheese burger and the turkey burger. Both were excellent. The onion rings are the best I've ever had. When you bite into them you get a bite ( not the whole onion ). Service was very good and the manager checked on the tables to make sure customers were happy."}
{"text":"An old school classic burger joint!  Bottomless steak fries with house seasoning salt.  I opted for ghost pepper burger and it was good.  The spice level was medium until I bit into a raw jalapeño!!  Whoa Nelly was that a painful experience! 
Tip:  get the burger with the raw jalepenos on the side!
Tip #2:  adult tasty beverages are small for the price so small sips.
Service was fast & the place was clean."}
{"text":"A food burger is always a good thing!!!  Great flavor & fast service.  

Drinks:  no issues.
Food:  fast and served hot
Service:  it was busy but our server always checked on us."}
{"text":"I liked the food, but....ordered an adult beverage and the wrong adult beverage came to my table, which ordinarily is not a problem....but.....the manager felt it appropriate to insist that I got what I ordered and that he had poured it.  Dude knew one thing, which was that he had not made a mistake. He did make a mistake...2 in fact....customer is always right and he had brought me the wrong beverage. Waiter asked that I give the manager a break, young fella was cutting his teeth. Upon further review, management is not getting the proper training. It is not OK to treat a customer like that guy treated me."}
{"text":"The Siracha Tavern Double burger was cooked perfectly and tasted great with just enough heat. I also Love that Red Robins has the endless fries. The bartender Brittany was great on checking on customers frequently at the same time taking orders from tables behind the bar. I really wish I could remember the name of the drink she made, but she recommended it. Overall, I'm really happy with restaurant and service."}
{"text":"They put an iPad type device on your table and then if your kid plays a game on it they charge you a 2 dollar 'entertainment' fee. Tired of this greed. Bad enough to pay 13 bucks for a mediocre hamburger."}
{"text":"I've seen the advertisements and was happy when I saw they opened one in Robinson Twp. area.

FOOD:  I just had a hamburger without cheese.  Little did I know that they give you onion rings instead of french fries.  The burger looks big, thick and juicy, but when I got it, it was a scrawny piece of meat with pickles and mustard on it.  The onion rings were so good - big and crispy!  After paying ~$8 for it, I thought I can get a similar burger for cheaper at McD."}
{"text":"Bad service from Taylor.  I guess asking for French fries is taboo!  We got the old \"eye roll\". Why do you ever ties and less orders of french fries if you can't ask the one that your waitress making you feel like a thief?  The carpets are filthy in this restaurant and it was an embarrassment to eat here!!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE USED TO BE GOOD! I and my party have had the worst experience EVER in this restaurant!
The service was slower than labor and delivery. The server couldn't get anything straight. Only the second coming of Jesus may get me back there!!! 
Good luck to anybody who attempts this train wreck!"}
{"text":"Red Robin is a solid choice.  Simple, burgers, sides, simple.  You can get bottomless fries or exchange it for a salad.  My only complaint?  I don't feel like there is much service.  The business model is to seat you, get you a drink and then wait for food.  Great, but my beverage is running low?  Something wrong with my food?  I get one check back.  And it is not that it is bad service, it is just corporate.  

Also - appetizer sixes tend to be a little small.  Actually, really small.  Never really worth it."}
{"text":"Not the place I remember. Smaller burgers, crappy sesame buns, going down the hole they are. Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever had at a restaurant. Order a burger they were out of went on the burger so decided to just put raw jalapeños on it thinking I wouldn't notice till I said something to the waitress she said o sorry we ran out of those... order a different burger the \"aka\" manager brought our new burger said sorry n walked away never introducing herself as a manager. Went to pay bill asked for change she brought out the dollar change but not the actually change and made the comment maybe next time we'll have those jalapeños for you.  No communication whatsoever between waitress manager and customers"}
{"text":"Friday night about 630. We were able to sit in the bar area right away. There is a new menu and many new items. 

This is the first time in a LONG time that my order was correct. The only unique thing I ask for is extra crispy fries and it never happens. The fries were great tonight. 

Nevada Red Robins are piloting a new thing. Plates instead of baskets. Yay! We get to eat like adult now. Seriously, I like having a plate instead of a basket."}
{"text":"The food was average, but the service was absolutely awful. We ordered an appetizer that never came. When our entree came out we had no utensils. Waited 15 mins for utensils to be delivered. Asked for a refill on my sprite and never received it. Not once were we offered refills on bottomless fries when clearly we were out of fries.I won't be coming back here and do not recommend anyone else to come. The servers name was Devante. We told the manager about our experience and she smirked the whole time. Will be calling the corporate office tomorrow and our experience."}
{"text":"The typical chain.  Cookie cutter burgers, service, etc.  Fun place for children with a great kids menu --classic American.  Couple of arcade games in the entrance, crayons, paper, and free balloon which is always fun for the kids.  Nice outdoor (Heated seating)"}
{"text":"We stopped in at the Goodyear RR last night for a quick bite, second visit to this location and only the second time in a RR. The service was average, my wife's burger was good, intructions on toppings was ignored by the kitchen. My soup came out cold, two visits, two bowls of cold soup, by the time it was heated my wife was done with her dinner, this is something they need to work on. I will give them one more try before deleting them from my options for dinner, it is really a shame that all sport bar type restaurants are cut from the exact same mold, nothing new here or exciting, just noisey and pretty good food for a premium price."}
{"text":"Great start, horrible finish.

Our family went to celebrate my wife's BDay. My black and blue burger was excellent, as always. My wife was offered a birthday sundae, she said yes as the kids would live the experience, and the sundae. We waited 25 minutes and no sundae; it's hard to complain about something that's free, but they offered."}
{"text":"I came for an office celebration lunch. Bad choice.

I ordered a vegan burger. I even printed it up in advance using their website burger builder. I gave the waitress the printout.  She came back - like I really could want a Bocas burger on lettuce with double avocado.  They either skimped horribly or didn't follow the order. Only a thin sliver of avocado, no red onion or salsa or peppers that I saw.

It is miserably loud. I can't hear the people opposite me at the table. Pound, pound blaring junk music and everything echoes.  It is like they made the place to chase you out as soon as you are through eating. There are people from our team at other locations i had never met. I can't understand them talking it is so horribly loud."}
{"text":"Joined the Red Robin rewards reluctantly, you can get points anywhere nowadays. To my surprise I received my free gourmet burger email for my birthday. They made it so easy to redeem and able to have a chicken sandwich instead of a burger!! It was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Amazon. The order was not correct. Called the restaurant and after five minutes on the phone for them to even find the order, the manager told me she cannot do anything for me. So I will never visit this restaurant or any other location. Very poor customer experience and wasted money."}
{"text":"Burgers - 4 stars - The beef was cooked to our liking and had tasty toppings.
Poutine fries - 2 stars - The cheese should be melted throughout rather than be fried balls.
Waitress - 2 stars - We had to wave her over several times, for example, when we had no forks or napkins. She was nice.
Price/value - 2 stars - We spent $50 for two people."}
{"text":"We were very pleased with our first dinner experience at this location! We're from the home of the original RR (Seattle) and this one was as good as the rest. Server Robert was great, friendly, and helpful. We didn't have long to wait to be seated or to get our food and everything we ordered was perfect! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything that is wrong with chain restaurants. First clue: robotically cheerful drones wearing baseball hats and headsets to greet you. Next: table buried under menus, special offer flyers, rewards card app, etc.  Then: food choices. I have nothing against red meat. Love burgers. But if you want to know why America has become the most obese country look no further. Unlimited fries with every sandwich? Really?  Bottomless rootbeer float. Oink oink. There is enough sodium in this food to melt the January ice on Lake Monona."}
{"text":"So disappointed. The burger was nothing like the photo. Why is this called a gourmet burger????? Bottomless fries but the staff never comes back after delivering the initial order. Water glasses empty, fries empty, right under an air conditioning vent. We were so excited to try this place and it was a total bust. Hope you have a better experience. I will not be rushing back to this place."}
{"text":"I have stopped coming here not because of the food but because of the slow service at all of the red robins that I have been to. I tried to give them one more chance but I'm through with this place. I really love the food but the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Not my first visit, just my first review. . . 

I had the Burnin' Love Burger this time.  Actually, I have the Burnin' Love Burger just about EVERY time.  Jalapeño coins, salsa, and Pepper-Jack cheese on top of a cayenne-seasoned burger. It's topped with lettuce and fresh tomatoes and served on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll with chipotle mayo.  And no, i did NOT memorize that list. . . I just C&P'ed from their website.

It's a favorite.  If you want a good burger with some imaginative toppings that you won't find just any ol' place, this is the place for you.  The drawback would be the steak fries, which are a little thicker, and not crispy (the way *I* like them) but some people look for that specifically.  I opt for the sweet potato fries instead and am wholly satisfied with my lunch.

Staff is friendly/helpful almost to a fault and the manager swings by at some point during every meal to make sure all is well.  I've tried many of the burgers, and while they aren't all equally yummy, I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Have gone here a couple of times now as it is right down the street from my house. I can tell you that my wife and I have been to Red Robins all over the place since it is one of her favorite restaurants. The food at this location was excellent as well as all of the staff helped each other to make sure that whatever we needed we got. Wasn't the biggest fan of how they did the layout of the restaurant as I am a big guy and some of the spaces are a bit confined."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant; Red Robin is a sure family & friends sit-down place for burgers & drinks.

Endless Steak Fry's, now you can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I am 53 years old and have never been to a Red Robin anywhere. What have I been waiting for?  Maybe my doctor would have approved of that fact, since had I experienced RR earlier in life, I'd probably be 50 lbs heavier with a  cholesterol level through the roof.

Anyhow, I had the Royal Red Robin, complete with the obligatory fried egg. It was awesome! Fresh and oh, so tasty!

I love you, Red Robin."}
{"text":"Newly remodeled space- great burgers.  The menu is getting too big- there are so many options.  Your best bet is a burger- any way you want it.  I, personally, like the red robin burger with an egg!  You can get it without the bun and fill up on french fries as your carbs.  
We sat in the bar area and had good service and a nice atmosphere.  It's a great alternative to the food court at the Galleria."}
{"text":"We love coming here to have a good Burger, so many choices it take some time to figure out what Burger you want. great beer selection great service places is clean. We love their fries ."}
{"text":"Well today I finally experienced how bad Red Robin is, I should have gone with my gut feeling, because it was as bad as I expected. 

Walking in reminded me of a Denny's which gives you an idea of how bad the good will be. The service is mediocre and the servers are inexperienced. Being my first visit I ordered a Peppercorn Bacon Cheeseburger w/ their average fries. The server never asked me how I'd like my burger cooked so I assumed they cook them all the same temperature. Turns out she just forgot to ask me and took it upon herself to cook it well done which is NOT how I like my burgers. The so called peppercorn bacon was just plain ol bacon with the sprinkles of peppercorn. The overcooked burger was not impressive and neither were the bottomless fries which I didn't even finish. 

The Fish & Chips according to my other half were good. I had a root beer which was 3$ and the strawberry lemonade almost 5$ (no alcohol) 

Here's the best part! They have what looks like a iPad on every table with available options such as ordering appetizers, and playing trivia. Seems cool and it definitely distracts you from how slow their service is. When the bill arrived I was very amused at the \"ENTERTAINMENT FEE\" included in the bill for using this electronic device that's situated on every table. I did not notice any information regarding a fee for utilizing this device posted anywhere. 

We spend almost 50$ for lunch for two with no alcoholic beverages! Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Worse place ever to have to have dinner. Started off with greater telling us problems with staff. No one on the place. Manager came over and stated will talk to him. Good out cold and manager stated will fix and and never did. Need new managers."}
{"text":"Aloha Hawaiians, I went to the red Robbin. After seeing all the commercials on tv for forever it was awesome. The endless fries are steak fries and omg so ono, talk about broke the mouth. There are so many dipping sauces and appetizers. The menu was huge.
My server believe it or not was from Hawaii and her mom from Maui. I was blown away by this place. Check em out."}
{"text":"This actually is a very large restaurant lots of seating this would be a great place for a very large group to meets and have a party when I was there there were at least three birthdays going on which is fun at first but then gets a little annoying the seating does feel a little bit like a giant cafeteria however it actually is very nice with a lot of atmosphere, lots of monitors playing sports."}
{"text":"This place was great compared to the arrowhead location. Waiter was phenomenal. Food was hot."}
{"text":"My burger had way too much hot sauce on it and they offered to remake it but I was too hungry to wait for another one. I ate the burger and left the bun...;( it didn't mention being an hot burger so I was kind of confused. We had decent service and what we did have was good. The price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Great burgers and great fries. This ovation gets busy, but the patio is open seating and is in shade during the evening. Their mister system also works good. 

We had Christopher tonight, and he was on his game and super courteous. 

Can't beat these burgers!!!"}
{"text":"We were served by Cheyenna.  She was pleasant and upbeat, which seems to be the norm for servers at Red Robin.  The food is always good, and one of the few places where I don't have to force my son to eat the food that I give him (he's 2).  Always a fun atmosphere.  Recommend to anyone who is looking for a cheap lunch or dinner that is quick, but doesn't feel like you're being rushed.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Red Robin in awhile. Was told wait time was going to be 15-20 minutes but got seated less than that. Host led us to a table in a very busy section when there were 2 or 3 empty booths available. Requested to be seated in a booth and host gladly obliged. So far so good. Our server was pretty good, too, although I had to remind him of the milk (which he forgot) and another order of fries. The only thing that was kind of disappointing was the breadsticks that came with the meatballs (Kids Meal). Was expecting real soft bread - the kind you'd see at Italian restaurants (I know this is fast food) - instead what arrived was those pencil-thin breadsticks that was broken into pieces. The meal didn't look like what was pictured on the menu. The Chicken Tortilla soup wasn't hot either. Other than that, everything was as expected. I'll probably stick to the burgers next time after all this is a burger place."}
{"text":"Everyone at this location is absolutely incredible, but the last time we went, our service was OUTSTANDING. Our waitress was Nicole and she took such amazing care of us. She was so sweet and attentive. We had been having an awful day, and her amazing attitude and smile just made it so much better.

Thank you, Nicole, for your amazing service!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the host had a great smile and sat us right away. Our server Kristina took great care of us for lunch. Burgers were delish, you kept us hydrated, and made us feel very welcome. Also, hats off to Victor for the new Hawaiian pineapple wings you recommended they were amazing!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! So much attitude from the staff it's unbelievable! And when we said something to the general manager he laughed!!!!!!!! Are you kidding me! It started when my husband and daughter and Friend and her boyfriend and I asked for a table for 4 adults and 1 child! The hostess couldn't understand that and gave us attitude and made us repeat it 3 times before she understood. Our waitress \"Kayty\" or how ever you spell it was rude to my friend and was smacking her hand on the table to my friend placing her order because she couldn't understand what she was asking. From there we sat 15-30mins with no drinks and got our food way before we got our drinks, how hard is it to get 3 waters,Arnold palmer and coffee? It's sad because the food was great but the service sucked so bad that I will never go back! People really need to understand that customer service is everything. We were polite the whole way through this horrible lunch and still got met with such a disappointing response. Laughing at a complaint? How do you expect people to think you actually care about your customers. This is just sad, respect should be given to everyone."}
{"text":"FIVE STARS plus plus plus goes to our server Cassidy!
TEN STARS are still not nearly enough.  Cassidy was beyond excellent!!!!   Our dinner consisted of 15 people during a very busy Friday night dinner rush.

Cassidy greeted every one of us with her warm personality and beautiful smile.  She immediately got our drinks and got all of our drinks and food orders 100% right. This can be a challenge for a large crowd, but Cassidy was so professional and cheerful the entire time while we were all there.

Cassidy also kept all the refills on all of are drinks and fries without anybody asking.

Thank you so much Cassidy!!!

Also kudos goes out to the cooks in the kitchen.
All of our meals were excellent in taste, temperature and excellent timing.  Not one problem at all."}
{"text":"I find it sad when you have to wait 20 minutes to be greeted by your server. I got a burger and bottomless fries the burger was ok and when I needed more fries I had to wait 20 more mins for the server. All 4 of us only got one drink no refills I felt that the server was annoyed doing her job! I am a waitress and do daily not everyone is cut out for it! Especially there!"}
{"text":"Like most chain restaurants when you go it's always best that you stick to one thing. My daughter and I had just finished at the movie theater that was about 100 feet or so away when she saw a red Robin she was like mom please can we go to red Robin I want to burger!

Back in my Bordo Gordo days I would have happily ate a big fat burger at this place unfortunately my review is going to be based on the cob salad it was actually pretty good I got a side of fries and had a bite of my daughters bacon burger which was delicious!  I kind of wish I had gotten one of those but I'm trying to watch my weight so I landed on the salad. The salad had bacon bits avocado grilled chicken and really fresh lettuce it actually tasted pretty good. I scraped the bacon to the side and had ranch dressing. It was really good, the waiter was really nice I actually ordered a side of fries and they didn't come out right away, when I asked him about it he apologized and said I was trying to wait until the food was ran because I didn't want to charge you for the fries. I thought that was really nice of him. The food came out pretty prompt and the restaurant was really clean. The service itself was really great as well our server was really nice very attentive ensured that our glasses were never empty. 

I will be back and the next time I go I will definitely have the guacamole burger I used to have it all the time."}
{"text":"we don't frequent chain restaurants often, but my bf decided to go yesterday for lunch. He found it to be a place for a nice meal back in the East.

As we entered, the place was quite packed with mostly families with kids. They have surprisingly large menu for a burger spot, and easy to accommodate various diet requests and requirements.

We had the fried zucchini and mushroom for appetizers. They were too oily. He had the Black & bleu burger with fries and it was flavorful but the garlic fries tasted old. I had the fish and chips with sweet potato fries and it was ok. 

The waitress told us about joining their points program, one of the perks includes receiving coupon for free birthday burger but we decided not to join.

The service is good and the food is ok. Their meals are extremely average for the $10-15/pp pricing."}
{"text":"Good gourmet burgers and bottomless fries nice change of pace.Nice nice variety good service."}
{"text":"I had dinner in the bar at this location on April 7. The service was good, overall, and the food was fine. Not spectacular.  I had a lettuce wrapped burger with peppered bacon. My friend and I are both limiting carbs, so I asked our server to substitute a different sauce for the premium ketchup that came with my burger. She charged extra.  It's a little thing, but it irritated me a lot.  I wasn't going to ask her to fix a $0.50 mistake, but I wish restaurants would train their workers a little better about things like this."}
{"text":"My server was average if not unattentive. The food was pretty good except for the fact that my burger patty still had the paper on it. Not sure that I'll be back to this location. The restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Alright, normally I don't review or think too highly of chain restaurants.  But something about this place just seems to be a cut above.  I've found myself there twice over the last month, and each time I've had good experiences.

I normally get the Bleu Ribbon burger.  And it is consistently good.  The fries are bottomless.  But you can also get bottomless side salads as well.  And what to say about the dipping sauces?  I love to dip.

Throw in a rewards program, and I'm sold."}
{"text":"I just had the BBQ chicken wrap. It was delicious! My mother got the BLT with French onion soup, but the French onion soup was so hard to eat, since it was in such a side bowl. I recommend getting it in a full size. Or not getting it as a side. The freckled lemonade is really good, but really expensive. Over all it was a great experience."}
{"text":"It's your standard Red Robin.

Once again, I was with a large group of people (40 or so) and though we were first turned away from RR due to seating, they called us back to tell us that they had room for us. Kinda sorta nice.

The waiter for my table was impossibly nice and courteous (we definitely tipped well) and the food arrived pretty quickly. Again, standard RR. I had a salmon burger, and the only bad thing was that the salmon started to break apart half way through. Oh well.

It doesn't really deserve four stars, but it doesn't deserve three either. Ehh. 3.5, then."}
{"text":"Two unrelated members of our group of six experienced severe intestinal distress (food poisoning?) after consuming simple burgers on 10/22/16. Even without the after effects, the dining experience itself was problematic. A tablet computer was offered in lieu of a gluten free menu but it locked up and the frazzled wait person was not available for assistance. When one person requested a free refill of the tiny portion of sweet potato fries, a basket of regular fries was presented and the correction basket appeared after we had eaten. Fortunately we sat outside because inside the high noise level and frigid A/C would have been unpleasant. Police/sheriffs were having a Special Olympics fundraiser which added to the mayhem."}
{"text":"Me n the wifey were craving a nice juicy burger so we came here to Red Robins....not too shabby....very busy when we got here.....our burgers were cook to perfection.....the service was top notch....especially our server.....great gal. We were stuffed....we both ate just half our burgers. Lol"}
{"text":"It's OK service. If you are ordering to-go food be prepared to hold on the phone. Perhaps hang up and call back after being on hold for 5 minutes! Literally!! 
Then wait for someone to acknowledge you waiting for a pick up order. When I asked the hostess to help me she shows me where to pay. But I need my food. 
Then she brings it out and it's not all there. 

While I continue to wait I continue to type. It's a mess here. They need more wait staff and friendlier staff. If I didn't have kids. I wouldn't come back. EVER."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Mekyella did not acknowledge us at all. We waited like a good 15 min just for her to take our order."}
{"text":"Good food. Disappointed I just called to place a to go order waited 7 minutes the first time, was hung up on, called back and waited another 10 to just give up and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It says gourmet burgers on the door, but are they really?  Yes they are available with multiple toppings, but the basic burger is overseasoned and overcooked.  They are also overprice.  Servers are friendly, but slow.  Drinks are ridiculously overpriced -- nearly $3 for an iced tea!  This can be a fun place to gather with friends or family, but the food just isn't the best.  There are other, better choices that taste better for less money."}
{"text":"#notmyredrobin. The chain has been going through lots of changes and unfortunately, not for the better. I used to love their wings and really thought they were some of the best around. And now, they are terrible! Opt for the Rib Tips instead. 

I'm not a fan of the smaller plates they serve the food on. Felt like my burger n sides were ready to fall off and no room for ketchup so I can dip my food. Also, I've been ordering the Keep It Simple burger for years and have consistently been served a juicy, well sized patty that is cooked right. However, on my last visit I received an overcooked, dry, small patty after I asked for no pink. This really did look like something you'd get at a fast food joint. Unfortunately, I'm done with this place and do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"I'm sorry this place is closed. I loved the food and service was good. The only complaint I've had was waiting way too long for bottomless fries."}
{"text":"We visited the Willoughby location of Red Robin today for the first time. We had the fish and chips which was quite mediocre and very overpriced. I should have stuck with a burger or salad. The blinds that were right next to me were quite dirty but on a good note, Daryl our server was very pleasant and attentive. Our food also came out quite quickly."}
{"text":"FOOD, SERVICE, ATMOSPHERE EXCELLENT...BUT!!!

Our server Kyline was so sweet and charming.  We enjoyed her so much.  She is a hard worker and very attentive.  In fact every one of the staff were so sweet and welcoming.   The food taste and quality were EXC...but here's the BUT:  the reason I can't give 5 stars is the portions are way UNDER SIZE.  My friend had a burger that looked OK size wise to me but they shrink the size of your fries order.  I had the chicken wrap....ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS....BUT....here again the fries order was small served in this tiny stainless steel ring and the wrap looked like it was about 3/4 size it used to be.  The check was just over $30 (no booze) and for that money they better fill up those plates if they want me back.  A full good looking plate is what will bring me back.  Too much empty space on the plate for my money.   RR: WAKE UP and smell the French Fries!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Red Robin! They recently remodeled the entire restaurant, food, and presentation within the last year. Very busy on weekend nights and limited parking so be prepared to walk. Always great food and good service. They are constantly adding Fun and delicious menu items so it's good to try something new each time. 

My favorite dish is the chicken bruschetta sandwich. I get it on a ledge wedge to be healthier with a side salad and it's delicious and refreshing. They have bottomless fries which are amazing and hot. I like the regular and sweet potato fries. Ask for a side of campfire sauce to dip it in. It's like a BBQ ranch and sooo addicting! 

Red Robin has the best rewards royalty program too. Every 10th burger is free and they are constantly sending me coupons. I don't think we have ever paid full price. Overall the price is right, food is fantastic and good for the entire family. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sure Red Robin is a franchise and they generally play it safe, but their hamburgers are tasty and the selection is good. Prior to my last visit I would have given 5 stars, now I want to give 2 1/2.

I have tried a few different burgers, but when I met the peppercorn burger I tasted perfection. Awesome peppercorn sauce, bacon, crispy onion straws, Swiss cheese, all great. I decided to try the jalapeño corn meal bun last time - skip it and get the usual onion roll.

A while back I tried the bacon aioli (seasoned mayo with a good bacon flavor plus bacon pieces) and I fell in love. I wanted it bottled to take home and put on everything possible.  Honestly, it was a reason to return, it was that good.

Unfortunately one of two things has occurred since the last time I came here: either the bacon aioli went bad and somehow became clear or someone changed the bacon sauce away from an aioli to some bacon fat slime.  When the condiment cup was put on the table I asked for the bacon aioli, they said that was it. Some dark, shiny pile of mush. I thought, well I'll try it anyway. I dipped a few fries in it and NONE of the contents would stay on the fry. They all slid off. If I was to emulate it at home I would only need bacon, bacon fat and gelatin. Not a dipping sauce.

I asked the waitress if the aioli had changed and she asked the manager, they said it had. She asked if she could try it (brave considering I could have double dipped) and by her face I could tell she hated it too. I thought they would know to take the $0.75 charge off my bill but I had to ask when the bill came.

They also took the $3 onion dip & fresh wavy chip appetizer off the menu. It was probably just too cheap and delicious.

I wish Red Robin would quit making changes that remove the consistency that I returned for. At this point I will probably seek out competitors more."}
{"text":"Can I tell you how much I love this place?  Because I do!  it is a perfect place to take my kiddo's and I usually try to take them here for dinner once a week.  The staff is always friendly and helpful and the food is just right.  Sometimes it takes a little too long to get our order, but all things aside it has good family atmosphere.  My daughter loves ordering their Shirley Temple drinks with extra cherries! :)"}
{"text":"Horrible. Slow service and the food was terrible. Not yum but definitely Yuck. Will never come back here. Least friendly place I have ever been. I wish I had never come in here. They should probably close this location."}
{"text":"Food was great today. Service was not. Appetizer was brought to the table. There were four of us there. They brought two plates. They said, \"anything else?\" Um...yes. How about two more plates. They brought the food out. The food itself was great. The next time they came back, we were done. During that time, we went without a refill, napkins, or anything extra we went for. They have great burgers, but no customer service. It's a shame. The place wasn't even busy either."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this location. Food was great. It would be 4 stars if I was just talking about the food. The service was not good. It took 10 minutes before anyone came to our table. Water glasses were always empty. Just an overall fail. Not sure what caused it. They didn't look that busy. The waiter was very friendly though. I doubt I would come back to this location."}
{"text":"Outstanding food service. We arrived very late. It was 11:45pm, when I walked inside and asked if they may accommodate us at short a late hour. They were very receptive and give us great seats with our 9-month baby boy and 3 year old daughter. The waitress were very friendly and knowledgeable of the surrounding area. Every issue we encountered was quickly alleviated."}
{"text":"I love Red Robin's all you can eat fries -- too bad I can only consume the ones that come with my meal.

I have good memories of Red Robin -- my college days when we'd go to the Red Robin out in Daly City and split burgers and gorge on the fries. When I left San Francisco for Las Vegas the last meal with my friends from the Bay Area was at Red Robin.

I'm glad that no matter where I have been there has been a Red Robin to eat at. I get moments where I must have their bacon cheeseburger. I fiend for their fries.

My only universal complaint about Red Robin is that it is freaking LOUD in there. I mean the kind of loud that is so obnoxious that I feel I have to take some aspirin. But what I do see everytime are happy smiling faces from their customers. They must be doing something right!

Food can be a bit salty because they put their seasoning on *everything* (I half expected it to be in my ice tea, too) - and their seasoning contains MSG. So being the fussy girl that I am, I always ask that absolutely zero seasoning be put on my food. Yea, call me a killer of fun, but would you rather spend time with me eating and laughing or watching me be carted off in an ambulance to the nearest emergency room?

What I also love about Red Robin is their strawberry shake...I haven't had one in a long time, but I know that if I even have one drop, I won't be able to stop. I will want strawberry shakes until I die. So I try to take a sip off of friends' shakes...which usually turns into a brain ache slug that leaves them with more whipped cream than shake.  :D  Oops, my bad!

I really do love their chocolate malts, too. That is such a wonderful dessert.

I've found service at this particular Red Robin to be extremely attentive and friendly.

I always leave with a smile on my face and an ache in my gut (a good ache, not a bad one!)."}
{"text":"My friend has this seriously strange love with Red Robin.

She called me on Thursday, \"I'm forwarding an email to you. It's a coupon from Red Robin - let's go! My treat!! But you have to print the coupon for me!\" So I hopped in my little car and off I went to PHX.

We sat in the parking lot and she went, \"Oh...it's  Mimi's Cafe. Do we want Mimi's or Red Robin?! Nevermind, I have a coupon for Red Robin, let's go!!\"

It wasn't late on a Friday night - about 8:30pm...and the restaurant was really quiet. We waited at the entrance, waiting for someone to seat us, but no one came forward. I noticed at the end of the bar a girl on the phone, giggling and laughing into the receiver...I had a sinking feeling she'd be the one to seat us. She saw us a couple of times and turned her back each time. After a few more mins she came and sat us down...turned out she would be our server as well. *sigh*

She was great in ordering, but as for refilling drinks? Not so much. Didn't help that the restaurant was 4% full. It's hard keeping track of all 2 of your tables, isn't it?

I enjoyed my fish burger, but not my fries. I ended up eating some of my fries because well...I was hungry and it was clear she wasn't going to come back after she dumped the bill on us. Oh wait, she did come back as I was halfway through my food (I am a slow eater) and tried to take my friggin plate away. Why didn't I enjoy my fries? It looked and tasted like the kitchen had taken old fries and refried them. :(

\"Oh, I'm sorry. I totes thought you were done!\" *insert insipid airhead giggle here*

I had food in my hands and I was chewing. What gave her the idea I was done?

I couldn't even ask for water because my mouth was full. I should've because I ran out of water...and I was thirsty by the time the meal ended.

There was more 'small things that added up to a whole big amount of pissed off customers' in my friend and I, but I won't even go there.

As a former waitress, just because it's slow it doesn't mean that your service has to slack...ok?

If my friend *ever* suggests this Red Robin again, I'll tell her I'd rather go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Always yummy! Our sever was very nice and helpful. Great place to celebrate kids birthday. 
Disappointed that we were told they only to military discounts \"some months\". That's different then we've ever been told."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a Red Robin for goodness sake, but it's a really good one. Service here is always super friendly and fast. And the food is consistently wonderful. Today's California Chicken sandwich was spot-on in every aspect. Chicken perfectly cooked, bacon crisp but juicy, and avocado sweet, rich, and fresh. Washed down with a San Tan Devil's Ale, my meal was very satisfying."}
{"text":"Idk about this place. I see it offers great specials but we have giving it a few trys but the hamburgers lack flavor. I order different ones every time we go but i always leave disappointed. So many better places to get a good hamburger. I hate to wait for the extra fries."}
{"text":"Stopped coming here for a while because the service was pretty bad. Tried it again today and nothing has changed. Staff is not welcoming and they don't seem to care about earning your business. We finished our entire meal without a refill of water, asked for refill on fries and they bought 1 basket with what looked like 10 pieces of fries.(there were 4 of us at the table). Our waitress came to us to tell us she was taking a break and we never seen her since."}
{"text":"We stopped by here to have a birthday dinner for my son. The staff was accomodating and took really good care of us. Ill start with the only complaint that I have...

My wifes sweet potatoe fries were served cold. As soon as I told the hostess about it she instantly delivered a fresh batch. That was about the worst thing that happened the entire night.

Now for the good stuff. They have a bottomless root beer float. Yes you read it right, free refills on a root beer float. That made my night over the top. It was a good float too not made with cheap ice cream and crappy soda. The food came out really quick and was prepared well. Everything was put together in a really nice presentation. Plus they can sing a mean happy birthday here :)"}
{"text":"We had Exceptional service by a young lady named Jess, she did a Great job when all else around her seemed to be going haywire! The Burgers were good, I had the Blue Ribbon burger & my lady had the Whiskey river burger, I can say they were outstanding! 
We went to the one off of Chandler Blvd, our table was clean, service was excellent, food hot and on time. Also I like the new table gadget where you can order your food, pay your check and write a good or bad review. We wrote a good one, if you are looking for a good burger and excellent service when you get to Red Robin ask for Jess, she will hook you up!"}
{"text":"I didn't know but according to the waitress tonight was their grand opening! 

The restaurant setting was very nice compared to the other Red Robin's that I've been to in Vegas. I'm so glad there is one by my house now since I live near the west side of town and I have to travel across town to get to one. 
 
Food was on point considering it's day one of business. My family and I will definitely be return!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst food we have ever eaten. My son's burger had pieces of bone, fat, and cartilage or whatever it was in his greasy burger. My husband's fish dinner was over fried and tough, the oil tasted bad, as if it was burned. The fries were disgusting, the oil was definitely not used exclusively for potatoes.   Even the pizza was awful.  I don't eat junk food so I ordered a small salad. The cheese in it tasted artificial. I was really surprised to see the place was busy. I guess a lot of people don't know what good food is, which is really sad. It was my first and absolutely last visit to this place.  Fast food = junk food."}
{"text":"I am a Red Robin fan.  They recently gave this location a facelift, and it looks much more updated inside.  When you first come in, there is a \"21 and over only\" bar area.  We appreciate this area and enjoy eating in this section instead of the back, which is much noisier.  

Appealing to adults and not only kids is helpful in my opinion!  I love the bottomless fries and of course the seasoning on the table!  My favorite burger is the Shroom burger.  The onion rings are awesome and the Mudd Pie is one of the best restaurant desserts I've had- reminds me of ice cream cake!"}
{"text":"This has been my first Red Robin experience AND MY LAST!!! And let me tell you what an experience I had. When my boyfriend and I went for lunch we approached this restaurant. The host was no where to be found and the place wasn't busy at all! Well 10 minutes past and finally the host comes up to us and there was a line behind us already. When she approached us, oh my gosh the young woman's breast were half way out and drooping. She didn't even ask \"how many\" or \"how are you doing\" she sat us down on a filthy table and slammed the menus on the table. When our waitress came up and assisted us. He was incredible and funny! I love the way Jaime assisted us and give his honest opinion on his favorite plates. If it wasn't for him I would most likely be rating this place 1 star. Jaime deserves a raise! Jaime is the guy with the sparkly nails btw :)"}
{"text":"Red Robin is your typical burger chain.  They have a great birthday coupon though.  Around your birthday you get a free gourmet burger!  It is about the only time I go to Red Robin.  Their burgers are good, not the best, but they offer a great selection of different combinations.  The \"some pink\" burgers usually have very little pink.  I usually like my burgers a bit less done, but it is a family friendly place.  Their freckled lemonade is amazing!  It is also bottomless, so that means free refills.  The service is ok, considering they have a secret shoppers and if you don't get a high enough score you're out.  Overall it's reasonably priced, clean, family friendly, and make sure you get a side of the Campfire Sauce for your fries!"}
{"text":"Many of my acquaintances who must also eat Gluten Free have been telling me to try Red Robin because it is fantastic. There is a reason why I rarely take the advice of \"acquaintances\" and this is it: they are rarely right. ONLY TRUST YOUR BEST BUDS!

There is one Red Robin in my area in CT and I had no desire to go out of my way to try a chain-y place when we have so many cool local places in CT and southern RI. However, this RR was right down the road from my hotel here in Homestead, PA and I wanted to take advantage of my opportunity to try this place out, finally. 

I ordered the Guacamole Bacon on a GF bun, a side of sweet potato fries, crispy, and a Poppin Purple Lemonade.

The lemonade was served in a funky glass. The glass was the only attractive part of this meal. The drink was sweet...nothing special.

The burger was actually good but not for the price...$10.95! (I can't recall if there was an upcharge for the GF bun). This was an average burger that cannot be called gourmet. There was a tiny SCHMEAR of some kind of fake looking guac sauce on the top bun. Bacon was cooked well. 

I did ask for crispy sweet potato fries...BIG mistake. Crispy must mean burnt to RR. Inedible. The server did replace the fries, however, they were only a little better...no taste. Rubbery. How do you make a sweet potato fry rubbery in a fryer?

I can see why folks who do not have access to restaurants that serve reliable GF food would enjoy Red Robin burgers. If that is all you have access to, it IS a decent, average burger. But here on the Waterfront in Homestead if you want a great burger on a gluten free bun...go to BURGATORY. My goodness, they are worlds above RR."}
{"text":"We went there they got our order wrong twice the waitress was horrible she had a bad attitude, don't think she liked her job. They got the order wrong twice and we got the manager over and we just ended up leaving we didn't eat anything. The water tasted like spider webs!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, wrong food with the appetizer and both burgers were also wrong. This consistently happens when we come. Lost a customer for ever!"}
{"text":"My family and I generally enjoy Red Robin when we go. They have a pretty good variety of kids choices which always helps for those kids that are hard to please. With the menu having burger, chicken, fish and wraps, it also has quite a bit of choices for us big kids too. If you sign up for the loyalty program they will send you great deal through your email. Tonight we saved $9 of a burger. 

My wife and I split the Madlove burger tonight and it was pretty good. I love that the burger has a Parmesan crisp on it. Something about that fried cheese that I love. My kids got the Mac and cheese with corn and the other got a hamburger and fries. The other cool thing about Red Robin is that they have bottomless fries. So if you have a bottomless stomach, this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"My must say our waitress was absolutely amazing but for some reason the food was slacking this time. My bacon cheese burger really didn't have any flavor like it normally does. Not sure what they did differently but they need to go back."}
{"text":"Ok we love this place been coming here for years. Well they just remodeled the place and it looks great came here a month ago food is still good. But the service is slowing down. Today dec 2 the service really was bad we waited to get seated about 10 mins and it took another 25 mins to get our food but overall it was good and service did come around.   Food is always been good. I'll be back    I'll give it 4 stars cause I like the place.   But if the service doesn't come up.  No matter how great the food is its not worth it coming back"}
{"text":"Rude/Racist server, OK Food, The burger bun was really soft to a point where it got into pieces with burger couldn't enjoy my food, Horrible customer service. Try different Red Robin avoid this one!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try a Red Robin, having seen enticing commercials about their gourmet burgers. I love a good \"house\" burger. On Monday of this week, Red Robin in Champaign opened for general service. They don't yet have call-in carry out, but they'll do carry out if you go in to order. TLDR: I'd give the experience 2.5 stars if I could; we're calling this a \"weak 3\" around the house. Given this rating, we don't anticipate becoming regulars.

Overview

Red Robin is not a fast food joint. There's no drive through. The default expectation is dine in. The fare is upgraded bar food (or pub grub) with a focus on good burgers made with fresh ingredients in tried and true flavor combinations. They also have turkey, veggie, and lettuce-wrapped burgers. Burgers come with a side; three of the sides are at no extra charge and these include garlic herb fries and coleslaw. Both of these items are just okay -- nothing special. I couldn't taste much garlic or herbs on my steak fries and the coleslaw was standard mayo-based restaurant coleslaw with a medium shred. 

Red Robin serves more than burgers: salads, wraps, other sandwiches, soups, appetizers, and even a few entrees (like fish n chips and mac n cheese). There will probably be something on the menu that everyone in your party will enjoy. They also have a bar (separated from the restaurant) and for the bar seem to mainly promote their beer selection.

First Tastes

For burgers, we ordered the DGB (oven-roasted tomatoes, roasted garlic aioli, and fresh arugula tossed in citrus olive oil dressing on a toasted ciabatta bun) and a straightforward cheeseburger on a sesame seed bun with ketchup and pickles (yes, for the progeny, who doesn't care for novel culinary experiences). We asked for the burgers \"pink\" and added caramelized onions to the DGBs.

The progeny liked his burger and fries just fine. His single-word response was \"good.\" For all that he's a teen with a picky palate, he also has a refined one. He can tell quality, and I've come to trust that his assessments are on point.

We thought our DGB gourmet burgers were slightly overcooked (they offer a choice of cooked all the way, slightly pink, or pink--we chose pink and got very nearly all the way), greasy (whether the grease came from the onions or the burger we couldn't be sure but the sandwich was greasy enough to soak the bottom bun and send runoff into the fries), and lacked balance. There was an astringent tart and sour note to the toppings. Was this note produced by the oven-roasted tomatoes or the citrus dressing on the arugula? Whatever caused it, the tart and sour note overwhelmed every other flavor: the savor of the beef, the pepper of the arugula, and the roasted garlic of the mayo. I suspect that whatever produced it broke the mayo, which dripped down loosely in curds off the patty. Even the caramelized onions couldn't stand up to the note, and that's too bad, because they really are caramelized and not just grilled onions. The manager told me their kitchen caramelizes the onions with brown sugar in batches and then reheats them on the grill to order. The flame-grilled burger patty itself, I should add, was of a square and somewhat compressed variety. It was thicker and heftier than a Wendy's patty, but also had a chewier consistency. It wasn't the hand-formed, soft, luscious patty I would have preferred.

Bottom Line

At $42 for a family of three (for one sandwich with one side each included, no drinks, no tip because carry-out) this was an expensive meal compared to fast food. Was it worth the price for the extra gourmet factor? No, I didn't think so. The burgers were of a generous size (half a pound), the meat (Black Angus beef) was decent quality, and the toppings were also made with fresh, good quality ingredients -- the price point is just too high for this to be satisfying, especially given the poor technique used in constructing our gourmet burgers.

Although we didn't dine in, I can say that this place was hopping. By 430, the parking lot and restaurant were packed. Inside it was incredibly, deafeningly loud. The music was loud. The several flat-screen TVs were loud. The staff was loud. The customers were loud. The decor suits an extroverted atmosphere like a better-lit, less cluttered TGIFriday's, with oversized toys (two 2' tall army men, a giant Rubic's cube) and pop art (two mosaics of Roy Lichtenstein portraits made out of crayola crayons and a vinyl stacked hamburger foot stool). The look is fun and energetic, but also modern.

Expect that in these early days, the new staff is still working out some kinks. I was initially told that there was no carryout option, but the manager was nearby and corrected the front desk staff. He made sure to accommodate us, and we're always glad of a place that shows it wants our business through good customer service."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great (endless!) fries, and also endless children running around. I would expect nothing less from a family restaurant like Red Robin, but it is quite loud in there at all times. I would not recommend for a date night or for any situation where you need to have a real conversation. But if you're stopping in for a quick meal, it's great! The burgers are a great value, and the options are endless. I will say, the milkshakes aren't the greatest, but other than that I have enjoyed everything I ordered."}
{"text":"NEVER had a problem with this location. Best one there is, I'd say. Service is outstanding and food was amazing."}
{"text":"Been to this one twice. And the service was poorer than the last. Took our order and forgot about us. I think the waiter realized that he indeed forgot about us and came up and said there was a delay with our food. Why would that be when the people who came after us already had their's. Weird. He ended our night by checking on us maybe once. We were there for probably an hour... Fun."}
{"text":"You're typical all American burger place. Aka Shenanigans. Quality burgers and great fries. The place to go when you can't decide where you want to eat."}
{"text":"Welcome here all the time for lunch on weekends. We sit at the bar in winter & patio during the summer Food is good, especially like getting any sandwich wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun!!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The waitress was good.  If you want to get food without hassle this is the place to go.  
*the only thing that kept it from 5 stars was...*

They use an on table kiosk where you can order, add to the order so on so forth and PAY.  When I went to add the tip the number is off.  My bill was $28 and change.  20% of $28 is $5.60 right??  Not at this Red Robin.  At this Red Robin 20% of $28 is $7+.  She was good but not that good. 

I'd go back"}
{"text":"Poor service ... Manager brought our gourmet burger with onions (we didn't want onions) and his solution was to remove the onion even though the burger would still taste like it had onions on it.  Then, they charged for garlic fries that weren't very good.  They did not offer to refill drinks until t was time to go ... do not think we will return"}
{"text":"Went here due to family obligations.  I was not pleasantly surprised by this fine example of American gluttony. If it was my dime, and kids were not involved this would be the last place I would be caught dead at. Pretty much a little slice of hell.  If you read my reviews- this joint is the type of place gum girl appreciates.

The tower of onion rings was fabulous as ,well as our patient, friendly and super efficient server.  Unfortunately from here things just went down hill fast.

Wings came out cold and mushy, kind of hard to explain, but they were not very good. 2nd order came out hot and half crispy.  Next I ordered the Chicken Avo-cobb salad. Such an ingenious play on words.  It was supposed to come with a chicken breast.  It was like 1/2 of a half breast that pretty much resembled cold chicken jerky, wow the chew factor was about 9 out of 10. I did not want to send it back as I thought that was retaliation for sending the wings back. 

Rule number one, do not send shit back at a chain restaurant. Rule #2 if you send shit back, do not send anything  else back, if it was that bad then just leave.  Unless you want saliva in your food.

I guess the fries were not so hot either, literally.  If a place has a rep for burgers and fries both should be good at the least.   

Summary- If kids are  involved,  or you want to break up with someone,  and or too lazy to drive to the Winking Lizard, this is your place."}
{"text":"I would never have rated it this low if it weren't for tonight. I have ate here for years and adore the reasonable pricing and portions. Tonight was a huge let down. Usually they have bigger and reasonable portions for the common person. I never questioned paying 10$ for a wrap because I knew it was of fair size. Tonight I discovered the drastic change in portion as well as the increase in price. Red Robin is NOT gormet.  It is a American burger place known for fries, shakes, and burgers. They should not charge higher pricing and give their customers bearly half of what used to be given. You can say I'm outraged but paying 13$ for a lack-luster plate of food and a bill for three being 60$ is a little outrageous for burgers. The food is GOOD. Always has been. The pricing and smaller portions are nothing to be desired."}
{"text":"I kind of think for these chain restaurants. they are what they are and you are gonna get a pretty standard sandwich and fries.

Came in with my parents. They both got burgers. I got a crispy chicken sandwich. Honestly, tasted just like one you could get at a fast food spot like Wendys.

But, the service was good. They made the fries well done like requested.........and they had a good honey mustard sauce so for that..........a standard 3 stars!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner and I enjoyed the burger.  My husband was not at all impressed with his - too much bbq sauce made it soggy.  We had the poutine fries which I liked but hubby thought had too many mushrooms.  Overall an okay experience until the check came.  If you pay cash you can pay your server, if not you pay with the Ziosk machine on the table which the server started the pay process for us.  I did not fully pay attention that the bill was considerably higher than it should have been.  We paid and went out the door - you really do not get to see the bill until it is paid.  I looked and discovered that we had paid the bill for the table of 6 that was next to us.  I went back in and was asked where we had been seated and after pointing it out and telling the manager that the other had fish and chips which was on our bill she offered to correct it.  I was informed that there was nothing they could do about the tip I added on.  I tipped on a $58 bill as opposed to our bill which was about $36.  They could have asked what I wanted to tip on the corrected amount and refunded the difference in cash, but never offered to do that.  We will not be back again.  The Islands Restaurant is right across the street and the burgers are better and no problem with machine errors.  Bad business practice with the Ziosk machine.  Too many unsupervised children and one probably moved some machines around and since you do not get to see your check before you pay errors are probably the norm not the exception."}
{"text":"Worst meal ever... We decided to take the meal to go so that we could have a family night at home. We get home and open up the boxes to find fries that are barely cooked with no seasoning on them, burgers that were soggy with less than no flavor and the extra sauces that were requested to be missing in action. If you are going to eat at this place never take it to go cause u will not have a good experience."}
{"text":"Was wanting a burger, but didn't want to cook dinner so I asked my daughter & son if they would like to go get some food, they picked Red Robin, we haven't been to a Red Robin since we have lived here so I was ok let's go try it.   The kids don't get the whole eating at non chain restaurants, there is still some push back and well this time I wanted a burger so it was cool

I ordered the Banzai Burger, I just love teriyaki burgers, the grilled pineapple and cheese with lettuce and mayo and for s&g's I toss in some thousand island dressing and it becomes this burger bliss!!  Now I like my burger well done, I'm not into the pink showing, but the burger I ordered was pink, told our server and he took the burger and got me a nicely done one! And it was delish baby!! 

Michael our server was great and attentive; making sure everyone had everything they needed. The manager even took my burger off the check, which I didn't except because I was happy with my order after it was corrected.  It's always great to have good service!"}
{"text":"Got to check out another place for lunch that's in the area, this time it was my boss's treat! He said hey we are ordering from Red Robin, what do you want, and before everyone gets happy, the burger did come with a meeting that had to be attended too, haha 

So this time I picked the Whiskey River BBQ burger, it had cheddar cheese, onion straws, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo and it was cooked to perfection but it was lacking that whiskey river bbq sauce I was craving, the bbq sauce was the reason why I ordered it :( but overall the burger tasted great.

It also came with their french fries and I have to tell yall, those fries are my favorite, man they are soo dang good. 

Happy to have been able to check out another place to add to my lunch time list! 
Red Robin 
Yum!"}
{"text":"They've got a good garden burger, which is always a great selling point for me. This place is a little cheesy and a little greasy and a little pricey for a burger joint, but I find myself here more often that I'd like to admit. 

It's a good place to go with a big group or with families. When my family visits, we have the old folks who are picky in one way, and we have a 5 year old who is picky in another way. When we all go to Red Robin together, we're all able to be happy. It's a safe spot for kids, and old folks are never offended by the burger option. It's a win-win."}
{"text":"In the past I have been very satisfied with RR burgers but I ordered their peppercorn burger recently and was not particularly wowed by it.  It was a nice size but the flavor was lacking and the bun was dry.  For 9 bucks I expect a little bit more.   Expect to spend 15-20 per person with drink and tip.
Service has always been good here and the folks at the door greeting us and at exit really do a nice job."}
{"text":"This is close to a four star restaurant as far as burger places go.  It is part burger joint and part sports bar.  It is a bit too busy for me with all the \"flare\" on the walls or whatever you want to call it.  The food is always hot, flavorful and excellently presented.  Prices are inexpensive and reasonable.  Restaurant is very clean including the bathrooms.  Staff has always been terrific.  I can do without the Birthday song.  Hate that.
The burgers seem to have gone downhill a bit.  Not as large as they used to be.   Still good flavor.   The salads are smaller now too.   A friend of ours was accommodated very well recently by their manager for a meal that was subpar.   Hats off for that.  Ultimately they need to bring their food back to where it once was."}
{"text":"Have been to many of your branches. Found this cute one on McDowell Road near Goodyear we went again right before Thanksgiving. Had a great server her name was Britt. Out of all the Red Robin Gourmet Burgers we have gone to with our family I would go back if I could sit in her section only she was pleasant she represents you very well and we have had some horrible servers there. She constantly runs I've seen her clean her own tables my daughter is a fast food MCD server so I know what it's like she is a good representation of your establishment and should be known don't know how long she's been there don't know how long she works with you what I do know is that I will come back to the one on McDowell and I drove an hour to get there. Always want to say that I give good and bad when it's deserved she deserves a raise. 
I really think you're losing money on your bottomless fries as great as you think they are I don't believe people are ordering your appetizers we honestly could say we didn't I would've like something besides french fries but I think you need to rethink that one. 
See you next time 

Thanks 
Mike"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday with a friend who started first grade with me. Our burgers were great, the service was excellent, but it's a bit pricy. However our food was excellent."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch and my table had a hamburger with the fries ordered crispy and also a chicken sandwich with fries.  The food was hot and tasty and the waitress Ashley filled our drinks and was attentive.  The bottomless fries are always good.  The restaurant does get loud but this little cation has held up its service and food quality.  The kiosk on the table is a stupid idea because the staff has to explain how to use it,  that is why 4 stars.  Forget the other chains Chili's or Applebee's for hamburgers, this is the place."}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Food was delicious and service was good considering the large amount of people."}

{"text":"We went here for a late night meal. The service was prompt, and the came out nice and hot. My only issue is their \"bottomless\" fries come out in small portions. 

Other than that, the food was great and our waitress was really nice. I've rarely had an issue with Red Robin and will come back again."}
{"text":"We go for the chicken sandwich. It's consistently good, so we always know what we are getting.
I am a touch upset that they don't have the blackened chicken anymore, but if you request it, they can piece together something similar. The decor is fun and the beers are big. The fries are also bottomless, but just expect small batches at a time."}
{"text":"Super fast! 8pm on a Friday night, we ordered and were starving. Burgers arrived in about 10 minutes! Ate too fast to take a photo, but the burgers were cooked perfectly. Waitress was pleasant and took care of our waters and bringing extra napkins. I got my burger lettuce wrapped...it was a lot of lettuce, I had to pull some of it off, but then it was like a free side salad, lol. Hubs got the one with the egg on it...can't go wrong! Solid burgers for sure."}
{"text":"5 Stars. Here is why...

Excellent Service on two occasions. Despite RR being filled with customers on both visits I was well tended to and received motivated service. First trip here during the Ragnar Relay left a group of us hungry beyond words. My second trip I trekked down there during Veterans. They were insanely busy on a Wednesday of all days and though the wait for a burger was long ''as could be expected'' they came through with once again positive service and a tasty burger. 

The burgers are good. RR has a variety of different burgers and sometimes they throw in a limited time burger fixed up with all kinds of neat add-ons. To top it off they have a bottomless French Fries option sure to throw you into a starchy coma.  

A final side note. Thank You Red Robin for Honoring Veterans on 11-11-15."}
{"text":"Me and my hubby love going to this location. Everyone knows our name, they even ask me if they want to start extra crispy fries {I have a problem} when we get there. They know what we like and always do their best.

Word to the wise: Do NOT sit anywhere but the bar and beware of the creepy manager {you'll know who, trust me} because he'll {did I just drop the gender there?} try to 'save the table' when there was a mistake in the kitchen, instead of just comping the food like a NORMAL person.

They have gone through a few GMs but the most recent one seems to have his head on straight and the staff turn over isn't as bad as it was."}
{"text":"Came here a few times.  It is always just OK.  The staff friendliness is a hit or miss.  The food is consistent with the rest of the other Red Robins, quality and standard is met.  Burgers and fries is their game so no issues there.  I had the soup and chicken bites too.  Food is decent."}
{"text":"I always enjoy their service, burgers, and ENDLESS fries.  I normally only can eat the amount the give you always.  But the thought of ENDLESS fries...  hum....

I changed to have a cheeseburger with bacon today (in honor of my nephew).  7 of us came to honor my nephew and celebrate my MIL's birthday.  Red Robin was his favie place and he LOVED the fries.  

1 minor con..  They stuff 7 of us in this tiny booth.  We were a tight family unit!  =)"}
{"text":"Meeting my friends there for lunch.  The first waiter screwed up my drink.  I asked for an icea tea, I got a diet soda.  The first waiter came by to tell me that he is leave this area, and someone else is going to be our waiter.  OK.  I told the second waiter that I ordered an ice tea.  He got me a new drink ASAP.  NICE!  

We ordered:  Fish & Chip and Crispy Chicken Burger.  The food was good but not jumping out of my seat good.  The steak fries are always bottomless, so it was good."}
{"text":"This is our normal joint for burgers and fish n chips!!!  I miss my Tempe gang!!!  Never an issue and food is always out pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"We were there today for lunch and WOW!  The food and service was terrific.  I ordered our usual:  Crispy chicken burger with swiss.  My husband ordered the Guac Burger.  We spotted a new item:  pretzel bites with dipping sauce.  WOW, yummy!  The server, Jerri was AWESOME.  She was friendly and super attentive.  Finally someone in the service industry happy to serve.  

They had some issues with our GCs, we told the server just take the complete $35 in GCs and not to worry about it.  The Manager gave us the 2 bonus $5 GCs back and said it was our lucky day.  We would have gotten like $1.50 back or something.  That was very kind of them.  =)"}
{"text":"We received Red Robin certificates as gift and so we stopped in for lunch last week.  As far the meal went my wife's bacon burger only had 1-and-half strips on bacon on it. She was disappointed with it.  My cheeseburger tasted fine but I could have settled for less as a quarter pounder is enough for me.  Service was okay other than the wife having to remind waiter that she ordered dipping sauce.  We should have picked up something at a drive-through, took it to the park to eat (it was such a nice day) and passed along the gift certificates."}
{"text":"Food taste great.  I got the Red Robin burger, the egg makes the burger.  The waitress did a good job bringing out refills and checking up on us.  Bottomless fries are always a good thing.  Only issue was the food took 40 minutes to come out, which we didn't mind.  The manager, Brad came out and apologized and comped us our meal, even though we didn't want to do that.  That's great customer service.  A lot of other restaurants can learn something from this."}
{"text":"I don't know what went wrong with this place. The many times we have been here before the service was great now it has slowly gone downhill. One waitress we had a few occasions ago was excellent. She was friendly, took our order in a reasonable time, brought us sauces in adequate amounts (I hate it when they give you a dinky portion that you know you're just going to end up asking for more soon), we never needed to flag anyone down and she came over frequently but not too frequently to see if we were doing okay.

The last few times were terrible. I think this is either the result of inadequate management or disorganization by everyone. Possibly both, okay I must watch too many Kitchen Nightmares or something. One time we were seated to the right of the restaurant when you come in, by the bar area. A girl came and took our drink orders, myself partaking in an endless root beer float (only a little over $3 I might add) and my partner ordering a margarita. Some time passed (10 min) and then we had to flag someone down to get them to bring us our drinks. Margarita was disappointingly small for the price but root beer float was fabulous as usual, they forgot the spoon which also had to be flagged down for.

Ordering time comes which was during the span of time waiting for drinks and so forth. Food takes awhile to come out, meanwhile the waitress is serving as the bartender for the whole restaurant making drinks one after another while waiters whiz by in and out carrying drink orders and we are left wondering when can we get a refill and where is our food? Food finally comes and someone else brings it and we discover my partner's food is cold. Sent it back and it comes back better but the whole experience was aggravating, no set server for a table and to keep flagging down people for things. It was like the equivalent to being seated next to the bathroom or kitchen, forgetful service and confusing, crowded and busy servers rushing by.

The next time we came they tried to sit us there again! We replied with a resounding NO and the girl looked very \"butthurt\" for lack of a more flavorful word. We explained why but she didn't seem to be too concerned. We sadly looked at the people who were sitting in that area, aware of the service they were about to receive. Finally we ended up where we wanted to sit and the server was just okay, not very friendly. I hate it when I look at other tables in a restaurant and I see their servers are way more friendlier than mine and then I end up having \"server envy.\" 

Summary: weekends are very crowded, if you are only two people they might try to stick you in the \"forgetmenot\" area. Families and larger groups they seem to move to the main dining area as I noted. I think I'm just going to find another location. Although I dislike chains mostly, Red Robin is a decent place to grab a burger $8-11 and don't forget those bottomless fries."}
{"text":"This is a safe place to eat a burger, and not wanting to be the adventurous type that night I opted to go to Red Robin. Walking in was kind of a pain as we waited for a few minutes to be seated, it was one of those where's the waitress or anybody?? front of the house. Finally a man walked out from the abyss in the back and seated us.

FYI in case you have never been: bottomless root beer floats for $3 and bottomless fries with any burger. Sometimes the steak fries are too soggy as you get nearer the bottom of the basket and some of them may be way too over salted, just a warning. The thousand island dressing that came with my patty melt was great, almost felt like asking what brand it was. If you are a vegetarian, they offer either Morningstar or Boca substitutions. 

It didn't appear that there were very many people in the restaurant but the service was okay despite this."}
{"text":"Food never disappoints. Service is always quick and the wait staff is always friendly. They're always very accommodating when you want to switch things up. And the kids love going here. The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Food was good as usual and the prices are reasonable. However this time our service was horrible. After initially dropping off our food we didn't see our waiter again until he slipped the bill onto the corner of the table. Not only did I want more fries I had been sitting with an empty glass of water for awhile. Will probably be back but hope we don't have that server again."}
{"text":"If you value service, don't come here. We came for my nephews birthday because he wanted to come here. Our server was one of the worst I've ever experienced. We had to ask twice for her to fill our drinks as she walked by our table three times! Our order then came out, wrong. Of course. But she was at our neighboring table twice as often. She did not stop to ask us how things were, just said \"are you ok?\" And kept walking. Hello? Is there a problem? It's not busy. Does she think the larger table behind us tips more? Sorry darlin' you're mistaken. So during calling her to get our check fixed, as the add-on items we ordered were not sent, we waited another 10 minutes after pressing the call server button. Seriously? So then, after saying \"oh, sorry\" she did not offer to even take the item off the bill or put in an order...I had to actually ask her to remove the charge from the check. Needless to say I will never be back, and this waitress needs to look for another field to work in. This is why servers don't make more than $2-3/hour. You earn your keep in this field. Good job RR, so disappointing."}
{"text":"Every time we have been we have had slow service and cold food. NOT THIS TIME!!! MAtt was our server and was very attentive and made our experience great. We will be back and ask for him every time. Thanks Matt!"}
{"text":"We are here last week and it was great.  The burgers were delicious and the all you can eat fries were a hit with our kids.   The service was friendly and prompt.  We will be back!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes a restaurant comes across as just a fancy, sit down fast food place that just happens to serve alcohol. The food and drinks are mediocre, not a place I'd recommend to a friend and certainly not a place I'd mention in a conversation with a foody.

The service is to be desired as well. Its not bad, they are actually pretty good and fast but thats somewhat their downfall. They are so fast that you feel like they are just pushing you out the door.

The only thing this place has going for it is their Seasoning. Just buy one and take it home!"}
{"text":"It is a great place for a good burger. I like the new sauces they have for the bottomless fries as well."}
{"text":"I like that you can substitute a veggie burger (a vegan boca, or vegetarian gardenburger) into any of their burgers.  The kids love the unlimited fries.  Get's really busy sometimes for dinner and service can be a bit slow, but overall a decent place.  The BF and I probably wouldn't come here by ourselves, but it's a good place to bring the kids."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  After taking our orders and delivering the bfood,  the waitress simply never came back to the table. I had two kids who didn't finish their food and i would have loved two boxes. My husband never got a refill on his beverage. Never checked back once to see if we needed anything. Thankfully they offer the pay at the table kiosk, so summoning her which was impossible anyway wasn't needed."}
{"text":"Kyla was my server at this location. She was awesome. You know it's a small world when your server is from the same town where my brother lives in Oklahoma. She was fantastic. Her bubbly personality, kindness and quickness made my experience here even better. Keep it up Kyla. (I hope I'm spelling her name correctly). 

The teriyaki chicken burger is so delicious. It's my favorite thing to get at Red Robin. I'm a little bummed though. They no longer offer the groovy smoothie. I'm so sad now. I will need to find a new smoothie. 

The restaurant was clean. The staff was helping everyone and the manager was making his rounds and checking on his restaurant. That was impressive."}
{"text":"Enthusiastic staff, quick service, healthy options. The burger I ordered rare and it came out brown with a tinge of pink through and through. They have healthy options like the lettuce and guacamole burger (450 calories). Wide selection at a decent price. Cool decor."}
{"text":"My adult son, daughter and I decided to eat burgers tonight for dinner. We all three enjoy Red Robin. I ordered the 'shroom gourmet burger with garlic aioli fries. My son ordered the Buzz Mac N' Cheese Tavern Double with loaded chili cheese fries and my daughter ordered the gluten free version of the Keep it Simple Gourmet Burger. The three of us ordered the strawberry lemonade as well. We ordered the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger and fries to take home to my husband and had it brought out near the end of our meal.
The restaurant was busy for a Thursday. We were greeted and seated immediately by the friendly hostess. Our waitress was Ashley and she arrived quickly to take our drink order. 
She was very good with waiting on us, patient, and she made sure the Keep it Simple Burger that my daughter ordered was returned because she and my daughter noticed it wasn't on a gluten free bun. 
My daughter has Celiac Disease, and she cannot have any gluten at all nor food items cross contaminated by gluten. Once the burger came back out she reassured my daughter that it was a new burger entirely on a gluten free bun.
Our food was hot, fresh, and delicious. We love the Red Robin Seasoning and the fries. My burger came out with regular fries, so Ashley made sure I received the garlic aioli fries I ordered as well. 
My son ate his burger and started on his loaded chili cheese fries. He got full and inquired if my daughter could eat them. Ashley looked it up on her tablet but also asked to make sure back in the kitchen. They were deemed safe for my daughter, so she started eating them too.
While there, we used the restroom facilities and the ladies restroom was clean and well-stocked.
I like the convenience of paying at the table on the portable electronic devices. It is even more convenient with the suggested tip at the bottom of the check. I chose to take the survey and I wrote about our waitress, Ashley because she was so attentive, and good at recognizing and taking care of the gluten issue, thereby saving my daughter pain and problems.
We will be returning in the near future to this location."}
{"text":"Service here SUCKS! Go to buffalo wild wings better its just across from red robin! Red robin used to be all about customer services...seems like they can care less now!!!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Got amazing service from our server Don. He definitely made my group feel welcome and was very attentive and made great conversation. I'll defiantly be returning to this location soon."}
{"text":"Yuck!  The food is so greasy. The burgers and fries used to be good, but after having not been in wars we remembered why. Will not be back."}
{"text":"This is the best Red Robin in town.
All because of server, Beka.
She is knowledgeable, fast, attentive, and makes every visit special!"}
{"text":"After having such an awesome Red Robin in Alaska this one was just not on par with my expectation. Upon arriving we waited a bit too long to be seated as there was no one ready to greet patrons. 

We sat down and its like your usual Red Robin but the carpet here looked really dirty and I think it needs to go. The bathrooms also need a bit of TLC and maybe a facelift because it was also pretty gross.

The food itself wasnt as awesome as it usually is. The temperature was too luke warm, the fries not freshly fried and my no special ketchup which is a staple with any red robin order (in my opinion). My husband's beer took a long time to get to him too. 

While the staff is nice and friendly, this place is just lacking that Red Robin \"Yum\" factor."}
{"text":"I visited this location on 2/18/18 my server was Jamie Ne. I usually get my meat medium well but when the server came out they told us its either no pink or pink on the meat. I have never experienced this at Red Robin before. My daughter and I both ordered the Sauteed Shroom burger. Which we have had several times at other locations in Las Vegas. The mushrooms on this burger were cold when they came out. And when we bit into our burgers they were burnt. I had such a foul taste in my mouth. I left my burger on the table when I left because it was disgusting. But I took a picture. My son burger had soggy bread he didn't even eat his burger either. We were never offered more fries. Whatever happen to bottomless fries. We had 6 refills of Freckled lemonade yet the server put 40 refills. And you know those tablets on the table, well don't let the kids play with them apparently they do not have free games anymore. My 9 year old was touching all the buttons and a game for 1.99 was charged to my bill. When I paid my bill. I did a bad survey. I spend $85.57. I also contacted customer relations online asking for a refund, but no one got back to me. I would not recommend this location. I have not had this issue at other locations in Vegas.

Update!

The manager did reach out to me and she apologized. She did offer me a gift card."}
{"text":"I came in for the free Veterans Day meal. I've eaten here before and the burgers were pretty good, so I picked this place out of the 50+ places giving out free veterans meals. They said you get a double and bottomless fries. I came in late to miss the rush. I ended up waiting 45 minutes for the burger and they brought it out. It's a double kids burger. Plus I think it's frozen patties. Good thing it was free. I'm headed to Applebee's for the 7 ounce steak. I had that last year and it's way better than this crappy kids meal burger. Pick a different restaurant for Veterans Day. I gave them a 2 because they still recognize vets, other wards this is a one for bad wait time and intentionally mid advertising the burger. Very disappointing. I changed my mind. One star. Being attacked by fruit flies at bar table. What would have been really bad is if I came with a group and everyone ordered and got nice big burgers and they give the guest of honor the kids meal. I bet that was an embarrassing scenario that played out over and over today"}
{"text":"Went in New year's Eve (tonight) for dinner with the boyfriend. Sat in the bar at a high top table there were about 4 other tables sat in bar area with one bartender which is not busy at all. Our bartender took 20 mins to take our entree order after we received apps. Which usually they would have been back shortly after putting an appetizer order in. Finally got our entree order in...20 mins after that I got up and walked to kitchen and asked for them to bag up our food as we had plans to meet friends for New year's Eve..the girl nicely said no problem and she would being it to our table sat for at least another 7-10 mins a female manager came over with our order and said here you I explained to her no one should wait Almost an hour to get a burger when the bar wasn't even busy. She said sorry about that and walked away. Horrible waiting for average food and horribly handled by management. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for my to go order that should've been ready in 15 minutes. Host was not very concerned. Poor service."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but when I am craving a burger, Red Robin is always my first choice! The prices are very reasonable and you can never go wrong with you choice, PLUS endless fries!!"}
{"text":"Great place to take your family. Kid-friendly, all-you-can-eat fries  and burgers are always amazing! Love their sweet potato fries with a Bonzai Burger. The Royal Burger is the best Burger ever! (Medium cooked)"}
{"text":"To say we had a terrible experience would be an understatement. From the beginning of the experience of being sat, throughout the entire interaction with our server, Grace, to the having to ask another server for assistance, it was horrific. 

I arrived before my guest and asked for a table for two from the hostess. Understandably, she offered a small table (strictly for two) along the wall by the kitchen. Knowing that both my guest and I tend to take up more room (between appetizers, drinks, and entrees,) I asked for a four top perhaps. The hostess, whose name I didn't catch, stated \"There's that one,\" and pointed to the table that is directly along the pass way between the kitchen and getting to the back part of the restaurant. Given that my guest and I were going to be talking about sensitive information, I asked to sit at the four top (booth/table combo) along the wall. The hostess then rolled her eyes and said \"I guess.\" Well, gee, thanks.

Grace, our server, took about 8-10 minutes to come over for my drink order. She had just taken my order when my guest had arrived and ordered a beverage from the bar as well. We ordered our meal (he a cheeseburger, me a Marco Polo, no bun) and asked for some fries up front. This was done, no issues. 

About 20 minutes later, our food was brought out, but no silverware. Furthermore, mine came out without bacon and had lettuce instead of the menu-stated arugula. At this time, it wasn't a problem, but Grace NEVER came back to the table to check on us/our food. I had to get up, not only for silverware, but also to ask the bartender to send the manager over 
(because my order was wrong, and has now been sitting there for 12 minutes, getting cold) and our server was nowhere to be found. By he time I arrived back to the table, Grace had miraculously appeared and asked 'What do you need?' I explained what was wrong with my dish and she offered another beverage (which I accepted) and took my plate away.  It took ANOTHER 8 minutes for the \"manager\" to come over to inquire about what the issue was (meanwhile, Grace brought back the same chicken and plate.)

 I explained that not only was the order brought out incorrectly, but when I brought it to the attention of my server, all she did (or the kitchen) was literally throw some bacon on arugula on it and bring it back out. They didn't remove the lettuce or warm it up, so now I have 20 minute old -and cold- chicken. His response? \"Sorry we don't bring out the lettuce or bacon. You want me to fix it?\" Seriously? No, sir, I want to sit here and starve. You SHOULD have stated \"Let me correct this for you right away, my apologies,\" or something similar, but to not even ATTEMPT at resolving it? Forget it. I'd rather have nothing at this point because of your service, the likelihood it would be made incorrectly, or that I would even be given silverware to eat it with is clearly not going to happen. 

I also had to ask for limes (that come standard) with the beverage I ordered. *eye roll*

Moreover, Grace TOOK the kiosk so that I couldn't leave a legitimate comment upon checking out, or even check out for that matter (had to wait another ten minutes for her.) I had to ask another server to ask our server to bring it back so that I could ensure she/her manager would receive comments about the visit. [Note: On the 'comments about today's visit' section, I asked to see corresponding Yelp review for details, this is it.]

Finally, Mandy, apparently another manager on duty, came by upon check out and inquired how things were and I let her know how terrible they were. Bless her heart, she actually tried to rectify the situation, but I had already been ignored, dismissed, and not fed for over an hour and I was over so I didn't give her much time (apologies.) 

Grace and that male \"manager\" (who looked more like the food runner in charge) should be ASHAMED of themselves and their 'ability' to give customer service. I am embarrassed FOR them, and will be sure to let everyone know what level of service to expect here, which is NONE."}
{"text":"I had one of the worst burgers ever. The bun was falling apart, the cheese tasted like garbage, and there were like 2 strands of lettuce. Plus I asked for pink on my burger and there was rarely any pink."}
{"text":"Packed on a Thursday afternoon.  They were able to seat our party of 8 without any issues.  Food was fine."}
{"text":"So I love this place always have I frequented this place in the antelope valley mall in Palmdale CA this location is just as good great fries that are always bottomless even better with a side of campfire sauce and get the red ramen burger before its gone and thanks to the server daniel with the tip to add fried jalapeños  it did not disappoint"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, I prefer this location to the Goodyear one.  The waitress was good looking and the cooks made the food just as we ordered it."}
{"text":"Food was good and was served in a reasonable amount of time. Staff was mostly attentive and pricing reasonable. Only one real problem but enough to very much upset my wife and I to the point of not coming back. Managerial figure Brandon was off-putting when spoken to, made my wife very comfortable and was somewhat rude to us when asking pretty simple questions about the menu. My wife insisted that he was acting flirtatious and creepy towards her on her way to the bathroom which is incredibly inappropriate and disgusting behavior and if she had told me immediately I would have absolutely reacted pretty aggressively. I don't want to blame the food, waitstaff, chefs, etc for our very negative experience but we will not be coming back as long as my wife feels so uncomfortable with the kind of leadership present in this restaurant. It would be bad enough to have any given staff member treat a young woman this way but for management to be acting so foul and inappropriate is beyond unacceptable."}
{"text":"Decent food, and my service was good. It's too easy to get charged the entertainment fee though even by just looking through the ziosk."}
{"text":"Appetizers good. Hamburgers bland and buns dry and cold. Server forgot our endless frys. And gave us the wrong check. First time , last time. I don't see what's the attraction."}
{"text":"Excellent gourmet burger. Love their turkey burger with avocado, chipotle aioli, lettuce & cheese. Good service, they always do their best to make sure you are satisfied. They have messed up occasionally with to-go orders but hey who hasn't? It's a great dining choice!"}
{"text":"Marginal at best. I remember Red Robin being so delicious and great service. Now it's been reduced to super small portions, neglected service, and self checkout. I haven't been here in over a year because of this, and was sadly reminded that it's still the same. Corporate America has ruined this place for me. Won't be back. Local places like hop doddy are way better."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in sometime, but the meal works for a chain restaurant. .. But  But you can't beat the  bottomless fries ... 
Paige is a great server!"}
{"text":"I've been a big red robin fan for years... Like the food, it's convenient, etc. but this time was different. We went in, and immediately my kids were attracted to the little computer on the table. So I let them play with it. Little did I know, there was a 1.99 entertainment fee on the bill for using the little tablet thing. I had a tablet in my purse, and a cell phone they could play on for free. I would have rather just sat and talked with my kids to be honest... Just a heads up red robin, you might want to inform your customers of any extra charges on the bill, before they accumulate it. I am kind of disappointed and feel a little cheated. Even tho it was only 1.99, it wasn't worth it. Not going back there, or any other red robin from now on."}
{"text":"The service is ok the food could be better I had the west yes BBQ salad because nothing else looked like it would taste good the salad was ok"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place, definitely. The only thing is that the last time I went, the service was bad. My waitress forgot about little things I asked for, which I think she realized after a while. Then she apologized, after a different waitress took care of my requests. 
The menu has lots of different options. Lots of burgers, sandwiches, and drinks. The burger buns can be substituted with a soy bun also. 
It is often crowded, but the place is kept clean. I like Red Robin."}
{"text":"My favorite Red Robin in Phoenix.

Whiskey River wrap and the new burgers (like Burning Love) are really good. We have to get our dose of Red Robin once a month or so. Love the service here."}
{"text":"Been to 5 Red Robins, this is probably the worst one I have managed to go to, but its not a bad place for a quick dinner with friends or a Burger.

Food always come out slower than expected, even when its almost empty, I have had to wait 20+ minutes. Few times I have gotten coffee, never been asked if I want cream or sugar."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Red Robin and I've had a lot of friends tell me that it's amazing, so I was pretty excited to try it....well, I was not impressed. This is just like every other American fast food chain, but with a royalty card to keep you coming back, except I signed up for the card just to get the free appetizer.

I had a really salty burger, with the \"unlimited\" steak fries - fyi, you don't really want to eat that many, so that's probably why its unlimited. I thought the fries were just okay, maybe I had a bad batch, since everyone says the fries are good. The drink I ordered, some strawberry soda tasting thing, was not good, but came in a pretty shaped glass. That really shouldn't be the pro."}
{"text":"The food was good, however they messed up a couple things. My burger was supposed to be a little pink, and my daughters was supposed to be well done...-well they mixed it up, and in top of that they brought a sauce that was nearly empty and the guy said, \"I don't know what that is, but I'll grab you a new one... I think they were supposed to refill it\" it was the sauce that went with my burger. The manager came out, and resolved the situation going beyond my expectation."}
{"text":"I thought my burger and fries and soda was a bit pricey at first, until I had 2 more giant sodas and a second helping of fries on the house!!!  Long story short, if you love fries and soda, eat up because this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"$6.99 for a great burger and bottomless fries. I say yes. Oh and the Burger was great."}
{"text":"Let's set aside the fact as a youth back in the late 70's, I worked for the original Red Robin location in Seattle.

We went to the new location in Downtown Summerlin a few weeks ago. I was good with the food as usual that would normally grant a 5 star rating however the sales motivated environment was a bit yucky.

As a former national trainer for a major franchise, internally it is all about Add On Sales. Appetizers, Drinks and Deserts. This is where the profits are as you are all aware when you dine based upon the offerings being provided by your server.

This night the sales pressure was on. I felt like the server was humping my leg for adds. The one thing that got me thinking the most was after I paid for the meal.

I was asked to fill out a survey. The server specifically told me that his shift consideration was based upon his reviews. Is this really the policy? Am I supposed to feel bad that if I don't do the survey this fine young man will not get shifts or possibly lose his job.

I am there to eat a frickin Royal Burger and not to feel pressure.

I guess this is what happens when a great restaurant becomes so corporate."}
{"text":"I went to Red Robin in Summerlin. I ordered take out. Great atmosphere!"}

Order was wrong twice, drink came with flat soda, wedge salad had brown lettuce, and fries were cold both times they were brought with my meal (never asked or given refills). When all of this was disclosed to the manager, his ONLY reply was \"Well, thanks for being patient\". Charged for grilled onions that were left off of my burger and when I informed the waitress and told her I did not want them any longer, she stated OK yet proceeded to bring them in a condiment cup anyways (probably in order to keep the charge on my bill). The bartender was MIA most of the time, server not very present as well, not to mention I had to seat myself when I came in! I have been to the Northlake location, and several others due to my traveling career however this has to be the worse one out of them all..."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here today. We had a little hick-up my wife's burger was a little over cooked but after bringing this to our waiters attention he quickly resolved it,  and then some. This is the best customer service we have had in a very long time. The burgers are always great and hey...unlimited steak fries?! YES PLEASE!!! Thank you to the staff for making us enjoy our visit."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! The food is excellent, desserts are amazing and original, staff is friendly, wait times are minimal if any, and the freckled lemonade is to die for!"}
{"text":"Me and my family went here today and it was horrible! Burger and fries were cold. We got are son some mac and cheese....well it was cold also. This as are first and last time going to this establishment. There was nothing that was yumm about it."}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Red Robin before.  I decided to take my youngest daughter to get a milkshake after a long day of festive Christmas shopping. We found Red Robin had old fashioned milkshakes when we looked on Yelp. They looked good so we decided to give it a shot. 

They greeted us nicely and sat us near a TV since the NFL games were on. Our waiter stopped by and said hello. We placed our orders and he was gone in a flash. He suggested that should we need him again to use the tabletop tablets. 

My kid started playing the video games and I watched the Cardinals game. Our milkshakes arrived and we started plowing through them. They were good!!!

We never saw our waiter again other than at other tables around us. I paid our bill before my kid was done with her shake and noticed an extra $2 charge for the games, which I thought was tacky. When I paid, it turned the games off and wouldn't let her finish. 

I'd have rated them 5 out of 5 stars but the game charge drops it a star. We will eventually be back for a milkshake sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I was here on Sunday and I have to say it wasn't that great. The hostess sat us in the bar without asking if it was ok. And of course they had football on and we were seated right under a speaker and they had the volume up very loud. I had to yell to have a conversation with my dad. We ordered our food and usually it doesn't take too long for it to come out. But that day it took forever. It seemed like maybe they had lost out order or the server didn't put it in right away because we had a lot of people checking up on us after the food was brought out. 
I had ordered a cheeseburger. The same thing I always get and I was very disappointed. The burger wasn't cooked how I had asked for it to be cooked. I like it pink in the middle and I know they can't do medium rare so I get it he rarest they can make it. But it was well done. There were some burnt areas and boy could I taste it. It completely ruined the burger. Nothing could cover up that horrific taste. And the fries were ok. Just ok."}
{"text":"My wife and parents came here today for dinner. We were seated fast. The server took our drink orders and came back for our food order.
My father and I both asked for thw gourmet burger with cheese. We also asked if they put any type of sauce or relish in them. We were told only mayo comes on it. 
They arrived in a decent amount of time. When the food was delivered I reminded our server that we may need utensils and napkins, none were ever brought.
I took my first bite, yep it had relish junk on it. I asked our server why as I had specifically asked for none. She told me that I was wrong and that she thought I meant 1000 island. The stuff was on my fathers burger as well.
I did receive a new bun to replace mine and finished the meal. The burger had no seasoning on it. Food should be cooked with seasoning not added after. Basic culinary skills.
I dont come here often. Since they added the gourmet title the portions seem smaller and cost more. 
Recommend island or smash burger across the street."}
{"text":"We love this location. We were celebrating a birthday yesterday and went for the free burger.  Very attentive and friendly waiter, Alex. Food was great, as always. My bacon guacamole cheeseburger was lacking guac, but they had no problem with giving me a extra cup on the side."}
{"text":"I love Red Robin back home in Washington, so of course I needed to find one down here. For the most part, I enjoyed my experience here, but there were a few things that I found a little disappointing. I went to the restaurant on a week night, so it was not really busy...when I walked in, the hostess was busy talking to another employee and did not acknowledge me, so I went to the bar area instead. It took a little while for the bartender to see that I was there and get me a menu, but that was fine. After giving me the menu it was like he forgot about me. I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger with the bottomless fries. It tasted great; just like I expected."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was delicious and fresh. I get a free birthday meal there every year. Plus I always utilize the rewards program (buy 9  get the 10th one free)."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, decent service, average prices.  The bathrooms however are tiny and atrocious!  Don't go in there!"}
{"text":"Waited about 15 mins on a Sunday night to be seated and not approached for another 15 mins to get my drink order. I had to get up and stop the hostess to ask who my server was. Ordered my food and drinks at the same time because we had waited so long and asked for fries to start out with before my meal. No fries came and had to waive the waitress down to get a refill on my water. Not very impressed."}
{"text":"This was a revisit used to come to Red Robin long ago until their burgers became overpriced overcooked. This trip I brought my two children we had a burger wings and chicken fingers explicitly ordered Wings to be crispy the waitress said no problem she must have left the food under the heat lamp when we got our food none of it was hot the wings were far from Krispy her smile was non-existent her attitude was poor the manager did take the Wings off the bill and remade them still never crispy food is still mediocre and overpriced the room was so loud you could not even hear yourself think from all the kids and families that they jammed in one back room would never come back this chain is overpriced and overdone"}
{"text":"Would not go to this red robin again. would take the extra time to drive to san tan. screwed pur order up multiple times and still made mistakes on it. manager came over and new the order was still screwed up but didn't really care. food was good but lack of service and attention to detail is a real problem.  will not return and will tell people to not go to this one in the future"}
{"text":"Our waiter was not very friendly and it took maybe 40+ minutes before we got our main course. For how slow they were you'd think they might be a little nicer."}
{"text":"This review is for my dining experience on Wednesday, March 29th at about 8:00 pm.  My server was Brianna R. and my 2 star rating is by no means a reflection of her service.  I am a server myself and there are certain things that I experienced during this dining visit that should not have happened.  Plus, the complaint I had should have been handled a little more professionally by the manager on duty and not fall on deaf ears.  Here is what happened.

My daughter and I arrived to the restaurant, and it was fairly busy.  Not really a wait at the door, but a normal dinner rush for a Wednesday night.  There was a few people in front of us waiting to get sat, and we were taken to our table within a few min.  Hostess was very nice and polite.  Our waitress Brianna arrived to our table a few min later to take our beverage order.  My daughter and I both ordered the flavored peach tea.  A couple of min later she returned with our drinks and took our food order.

My daughter ordered the chicken strips with the bottomless fries, and I ordered the prime rib dip with onion rings and a starter side salad.  About 5 min later my side salad arrived. I was kind of shocked to see the size of the salad and how small it was for $4.99.  The plate was literally 2 inches by 2 inches and maybe about 3 oz of salad.  Basically, I ate the salad in about 5 bites.  $4.99 for that?  Really?  While halfway through my side salad, our main courses arrived.  Now, being in the service industry you would think that you would allow your guests to at least finish their appetizer before bringing out the main course.  But, at least the kitchen was putting the food out fast.  My daughters said her chicken tenders were just ok, but the fries were cold and stale.  She was hungry enough and ate them anyway, but again, they were cold.  My prime rib dip sandwich was ok, but the purpose of the jus dip is to be flavorful and soak into the bread and be edible.  However, my main complaint was the fact that the prime rib jus dip was like grease water.....literally!  I brought this to the attention of Brianna, our waitress, and she apologized and told me that she would notify her manager on duty right away and have him come by.  About 10 min or so after that, I was done with the sandwich and the onion rings and I had pushed my plate to the end of the table NEVER seeing the manager!  It wasn't until Brianna came back to the table to clear the plates when I told her that the manager never came by but I was already done eating.  I asked her for the check so we can just get out of here; I was clearly frustrated.

She apologized again, and said she would go get him.  A few moments later the manager came by the table.  I never got his name as he never introduced himself to me, he just approached the table with, \"Hi, how are you.  Brianna said you wanted to see me?\"  I explained to him my issues about the jus dip, told him that I had waited for him to come by, but he didn't so I just finished my meal anyway without the jus dip.  He said that he appreciated me telling him and that if it's not brought to his attention then he can't change it.  He could also see and hear how frustrated I was with the experience, but all he said in his departure from my table was that he thought he didn't have to come by, thus, blaming Brianna's communication with him stating that I didn't need him to come by.  Clearly, a big breakdown in communication happened here.  

After waiting about 10 min more, Brianna came by once again just to make sure everything was resolved. I told her that my experience was not anything having to do with her because she has no control over the kitchen or what the managers do.  However, I did recognize her for the fact that she got triple sat, including our table, and did the best she could for that little pop she got.  So, again, no negative reflection on her.  Brianna then asked if I wanted to pay cash or with credit, and I told her that I would just use the little kiosk on the table to pay.  While she was standing there, I showed her the bill and I was absolutely amazed that the manager didn't even bother to take anything off the bill or even offer any type of dessert to make the situation right.  Let me be clear about this:  I am not looking for a free meal, but I have been in the service industry for over 20 years and have even been in management.  There is no excuse that can be made that would warrant a manager not doing anything or offering anything to make the situation right.  With all of the different dining options that are available to choose from in that same area, what would make me want to come back to this Red Robin and eat again after this experience, let alone any Red Robin for that matter?  Instead, the manager passed the blame back on the server.  I ended up paying for my full meal which came to $41.36 and I rounded up to $50 for the tip.  Again, no negative reflection on Brianna because she was great, but I won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a big chain. The burgers taste great, all though they do put on too much mayo, but very juicy meat. The fires are AMAZING. The chicken strips have great taste. And for the kids, the macaroni and cheese is outstanding. Reason I gave 4 stars is the fact that they are way over priced."}
{"text":"We had the worst service ever. It took us 15 mins to get our drinks and 25mins for my husband to get his beer. Our waitress spilled some wine on the floor next to our table and did not even wipe it up. They really need to get it together."}
{"text":"I posted a review on the red robin in surprise and it was not a great experience. I received a gift card for the horrible service so we decided to try the one in Goodyear. This was way better than our last experience. Our server named mike was excellent. The food was great as well. The only thing I would say about this visit was it took a while to get bottomless sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Had the Red Royal Robin burger, which was very juicy.  The steak fries were excellent. The service was fast and friendly. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Overachiever: This is how I would define Red Robin. I believe I counted 26 different hamburgers on the menu. That's alot. I tried the Chili Chili Cheeseburger which the menu describes as follows.

\"You might need an extra napkin. Served open-face with a generous helping of Red's Chili Chili, Cheddar cheese, chipotle aioli and diced red onions. Cleanup crew not included. $10.69 \"

Personally when I make chili I don't include beans. My wife on the other hand, does. The great debate of beans in chili will continue for another day.

I also noticed patio dining. Now, this Red Robin is part of a massive shopping center in northwest Las Vegas, Nevada. You exit the main dining floor, to the patio, which on the opposite side is part of the shopping center. The back exterior wall of a store and it's electrical boxes will be your view.

I like Red Robin, but personally I feel they just try a little TOO hard."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my son's bday with a party of 8. Greeter gal was not having a good day she was giving us that oh no party of 8 look  Server was trying his best however the cooks got it very wrong with undercooked chicken 1 wrong burger and soggy fries on the kids meals. The manager apologized for the chicken they cooked another one however the party was over by the time the salad came out. The wrong burger has pieces of mac and cheese and I did not order that item. Can't go back for a while that's for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The service on the hand was dreadful!!! Our server was slow and it seem like he might have been new. If he wasn't, then god help his other tables! It was a Wednesday and the place wasn't crowded. Yet, the kids food took forever. Oh, guess what? He brought the wrong meal out. I love their phone and not fond of this location"}
{"text":"Great service, and I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes, even with all of the people here for spring training. They always make my order correctly and I'll definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food that I have here. I know that when I come I will be greeted with a smile and our server is always nice. We had Angie this time and she was so sweet."}
{"text":"The first couple of times I visited it was standard chain fare. Fine as an option of last resort but tasty nonetheless. The last time I visited I was horrified by the filth of this location. We were seated at a table with a dirty table and mess of soggy napkins and fries on the floor. It immediately made my stomach turn so we left."}
{"text":"Red Robin is a flashy attempt at a burger joint. I have had quite a few of their and a few non burger dishes.

SO..to be blunt and to the point you can slap all kinds of sauces and ingredients on a burger but if the foundation is weak...well you get the idea. A real burger needs a patty that didn't come as a frozen disc.

Other than the preformed patties the place isnt all bad..just not my piece of cake..or beef if you will."}
{"text":"Good, wholesome, filling burgers and fries. Excellent, quick service in a pleasant family eatery setting. The seasoning stored at each table is a heavenly addition to any basket of fries or other appetizer. Nice location too, right inside the Tempe Marketplace. A good Red Robin."}
{"text":"Tuesday night 5:30 and we sat in bar area-- Server took our order after about 10 minutes--food took much longer then normal-- someone beside server delivered food-- asked for more fries 3 different times-- finally we got pissed and decided to leave-- paying bill and guy shows up with fries---haha-- were in the restaurant 1 hr and 22 minutes and saw server 2x-- like Red Robin but won't be back to this one for a long long time!!"}
{"text":"Damn.... For 1 I always feel terrible leaving sub par reviews for restaurants because I've been in the service industry for 7 years.... But man .. I went here with my parents and i first had a question for the hostess about whether or not I was able to hit my e cig inside the restaurant.. The hostess replied \"I don't know?\" And that was it... Usually when a service employee responds with \"I don't know\" it's usually followed by \"but I'll be sure to find out\". Never happened.. Secondly it took eight minutes for my family and I to be greeted which as you service people know to a consumer is like a lifetime..thirdly my beer glass came out with two different lipstick marks...niiiice...fourthly some random food runner, BOH trained dropped our appetizer off with his gloves still on, then proceeded to leave as quickly as he came without asking if this was what we ordered or if we needed anything else.. Lastly we received our to go food, perfectly bagged with appropriate sauces on the side as we asked..come find out later there were like 7 fries for my order.. For a place that let's everybody and their mother know about their endless fry baskets, I guess those who order food to go are subject to the cutting food cost method of skimping on to go orders... Final note  .. I gave 2 stars because our server was polite and none of my issues besides the fact that the greeting took quite a long time was her fault..needless to say STEP UP YOUR GAME LAS VEGAS MANAGERS!!!! Foh and BOH starts and ends with you!!"}
{"text":"It may just me but I think Red Robin has gone down hill. I used to love to get me a good burger at this location. Not so much anymore. Service was slow and fries were old and overcooked. Only reason I go there still is because my kids like it. But each time I go I get more and more against the idea of going there again."}
{"text":"We decided to come to this restaurant for dinner, no kids,  just my husband & I.  The hostess first sat us in the bar,  we did not ask to be sat there,  she assumed we wanted to sit there.  We don't typically drink out nor do we watch any kind of sports games.  In the bar everyone is loud enough I couldn't hear my husband ask me a question.   We asked to be moved & were told we'd have to wait a few minutes.  I asked why because it's not like the place was packed,  she said the tables needed to be cleaned.   We waited and then were seated at a dirty table!   Really?   Can we not clean the tables so they are not sticky to touch?   Could you at least clean the chicken tenders off the floor under the table?   Ridiculous!   First time in was good,  2nd time a little questionable,  after this time. .....I won't be back!   We ended up at Carrabba's, Yumm!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we will never be back.  My husband ordered a burger and fries and ordered a basket of the bottomless fries with his order.  When his meal was delivered to the table, there were only a few fries on his plate and no order of \"bottomless\" fries that he already asked for.  So, he once again asked for more fries.  The waitress disappeared for a while and when she was walking past our table we flagged her down and asked her if our fries would be out.  She assured us they were coming, they were just busy. We finished our food and decided to go ahead and pay the bill to save time, since we were just waiting on the fries.  We waited and waited.  Finally, she stopped at our table and told us to have a good night.  My husband again asked what about his order of fries.  I kid you not, the waitress told us that customers who just came in were their priority and we were not since we had already gotten our food.  Then she told us if we spoke with the manager we would get the fries.  Really?!  We walked out without the fries and will never be back."}
{"text":"We had one of the most amazing servers today. Kyla went above and beyond to help us decide what it was we wanted to eat. She came to the table with a warm smile and a very pleasant attitude. I love how she handled all of the children around us. She actually took the time to engage with each and everyone of them. She also went out of her way to  thank each and every veteran that sat anywhere near us. Our food was brought out quickly and I've gotta say it was wonderfully fresh and hot. Burgers had amazing flavor and the fries were super hot and fresh. I will suggest that all of my friends, family, and coworkers come in just to see Kyla work."}
{"text":"Came here because I got coupons mailed to me. Happy hour board said margaritas were $4.50. I was charged $5.50 and they would not honor their own sign. The three stars are because the food was good. The manager on duty was not quick to apply our coupon so we waited about 10 minutes for her to do that. I don't think I'll be in any hurry to return here when there are plenty of other restaurants around that will honor their own drink prices."}
{"text":"Not sure if management has changed recently, but we had the best service ever!  Our waitress was very alert, fast with refills and the food was great.  Our servers name was Chelsea, and she was fantastic!   If we keep getting servers like that we will continually be back."}
{"text":"Once again Red Robin disappoints. Out of onion rings, buns on all our sandwiches were not only stale and hard but burnt as well. Server was great and very sorry of course, was not his fault. Seems the same every time we go there and we won't be back."}
{"text":"I went in for my birthday burger and had no complaints with the burger.  The bottomless fries however got worse with each order.  I ordered a total of 3 servings of fries.  The first was good, crispy, and hot.  The second order was cold.  The third order was pieces, cold, and burnt.  I think they give you lousy fries to keep you from ordering more."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are good. Service was good. The cheesecake is nasty!!!!! $3.99 for bottomless drinks is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"For a burger specialist it's terrible. If you want a hamburger make it yourself guaranteed to be better then this place."}
{"text":"Everything was dripping with grease. Waitress was MIA most of the visit. The burger was pretty good, complements to the \"chef.\" Service was subpar. Out of all the restaurants in this area we made a poor choice for a late dinner."}
{"text":"Really busy joint on an early Saturday evening; really popular with young families. Joined relatives after waiting about 20-min for a booth. Fast service, clean tables, fast menus and drinks.  We enjoyed standard Red Robin beef & chicken burgers/sandwiches, milk shake, iced teas, and tap Guinness. The food was prepared, and tasted as we expected it. Very loud atmosphere from all the conversations around us."}
{"text":"The hostess was rude and the service was very slow. We were over charged for a appraiser and it took the server a long time to come to us"}
{"text":"Server was good was busy there give it's a Friday, food not so good very salty. We mainly came for the sweet potatoe fries but that was a let down, the fries were very salty. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"OMG.. how I love Red Robin.. their Royal Burger is to die for.. I crave it all the time.. so YUMMMM..."}
{"text":"Never had a problem with this store location but I  just had the worse service I've ever experienced.  The drinks were watered down the servers were not very at tentative when I asked for more fries I did not receive them till after I was done eating & we were ready to leave, just all around bad service."}
{"text":"We have been here a lot recently, the bottomless fries being a significant hit!  The burgers are good, and I'm told that the chicken sandwiches are very good also.  When we're having a bigger meal, starting out with onion rings on a pole and finishing with donuts on a pole is both delicious and fun.  For a lighter meal, try the Wedge Salad appetizer with the fries.  For the adults, I can recommend the Guinness and Ice Cream concoction."}
{"text":"Red Robin has an excellent selection of burgers at a good price, and the service was great! We arrived at 3pm on a Friday and sat in the bar area. They had about 4 televisions tuned to sporting events."}
{"text":"I ate here once wasn't happy with service ordered a lemonade got something with alcohol in it. Told them I didn't order it waitress said I did. She wouldn't take it off my bill. The chicken sandwich I ordered was good though."}
{"text":"Usually after leaving here; if give RR 3-4 stars but our waitress was incredible! We loved having Rachel as our waitress! She was friendly, happy and just a pleasure to be around! Our order was right, food was delicious and we couldn't be happier! Wish every server was as good as she was!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, the last time being yesterday.

Gte the Bonzai burger. It has pineapple and teriyaki sauce on it and is very good. Their burgers are definitely fresh and moist. I also liked the Mint Chocolate Brownie shake I had for dessert. Good service, good food, cool retro decor, fun to eat here after a movie!"}
{"text":"Seems like bad management at this location, dirty floors, messed up orders at almost every table, our order was not put in so we had to wait over an hour for our food, then the Food came out wrong. We talked with the manager who really didn't seem to care. I wouldn't Waste your time at this location. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Why is this place always filthy? Dust everywhere by the booths, and it never fails we are sat at a table that isn't fully clean with food on the chairs. They seriously need to take a look at their cleanliness because I can only  imagine the kitchen if the front is this bad."}
{"text":"We went to this location for dinner tonight, we had food and we're treated well by the servers. I left a good review on our receipt for the woman who helped us. Upon leaving the dining room and next to the bar I slipped and fell to the ground hurting my hand and knee. The floor was obviously wet, but there was no wet floor sign to be seen. Never did an employee ask if I was okay or even acknowledge that I fell. When I got up I made eye contact with the man with a mustache who was in charge of the bar. He did not attempt to ask if I was okay. That experience has left me not wanting to visit this location. The food we had was great and the service when eating was good. But if the staff is so oblivious to their surroundings I don't want to go back to this location. I hope management sees this review and invests in a wet floor sign!!!"}
{"text":"They always have the best burger combinations! You gotta love the endless fries too, my favorite are the sweet potato fries. I like when they come out with new hamburgers on their menu. This was my favorite place to go when I was pregnant."}
{"text":"When we first arrived, we sat for a while and no one paid any attention that we were there and never came over to take our drink order. We went and got the manager and he brought our server out. She proceeded to take our order with attitude. So we went back to get the manager. He then took our order and handled our table himself. After a while another Server came to our table. She was great, personable and did a great job all around. The management handle this situation well and we appreciate that they cared to keep our business."}
{"text":"Sticky and wobbly tables! Server didn't offer to move us, said it's \"always like this.\" Server was very abrupt and not helpful. After we received our order, he left and never came back. I ordered the new mac n cheese burger after seeing the tv commercial. It looked gooey and delicious. Mine however, had white elbow noodles on it with NO sign of cheese!
We won't be back to Red Robin."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. The spot is a little tired and could use a face lift, but service has always been prompt and efficient. Red Robin is a great burger spot in a pinch, but in our area we happen to have awesome burger joints, which is why I only gave it a 4/5. STILL, if you're watching calories or paleo, you can do it at Red Robin! Lettuce wrap options for all sandwhiches and sweet potato fries. It's not all bad at Red Robin."}
{"text":"The food was good but the customer service needs improvement. First off as we walked in the greeter did not greet us, just asked how many of us and took us to our seat. Secondly they brought us our food, asked if we need anything else, we say ranch and the waiter just walks away. Thirdly they got my boyfriends order wrong and when he told them they just took the plate from his hands and didn't even apologize. And lastly, as we walked out the same greeter and another young lady were just conversing, didn't even say bye or acknowledged us leaving. Like I said, customer service needs improvement."}
{"text":"Red Robin has the best burgers I love going to the one in downtown summerlin , I happen to go to the one in centennial hills, I had the worst waitress ever , horrible on a slow night. We waited forever for our food and she forget to get our soup she was like oh yeah I forgot that . But the food is always good next time this won't be the place I dine at."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Red Robin I have ever dined in. It took almost an hour to get our food and when it got here it was horrible. We usually eat at the one on Centennial. The food there is always the same. Delicious. I can't believe this is the same restaurant. I got the southern charmer like akways. The one here didn't taste the same and was half the size of normal. NEVER eat at this location."}
{"text":"Despite calling 5 times between us, no one picked up the phone on a Saturday evening. The only reason we still went there is because we wanted to try somewhere new. Honestly, the food is ridiculously overpriced. I used to manage a well known restaurant on the Strip where the burgers were the same price. $13.99 for a take-out burger in Henderson is crazy! The sweet potatoes fries were bland and soggy. Half of my bun was soggy. We live less than a mile from here so there's no excuse for soggy food that is luke warm.
Bad customer service and soggy food...We won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Got seated quickly, waiter was cool, ordered food,waited for a looooooog time to get food. Was given the excuse of \"Because you ordered a \"Monster\" burger (two patties) that is why it is taking so long. WHAT A JOKE. Not coming back"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location a couple of time. The food is always fresh, hot and cooked the way I ask.  Service is excellent.  I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Bad bad bad...overprice over cooked!! Save your money and go to whataburger! Not even worth the free bday burger we got!"}
{"text":"Heavy. That's the first word that came to mind when I looked at the menu. My sister really likes the California burger & my daughters friends worship the milkshakes there. I guess you just have to be in the mood, & by you I mean me :)

I had the chicken tortilla soup, which was good & a small Caesar salad, which was average."}
{"text":"I've wanted to go to a Red Robin for as long as I can remember because the idea of a diner with burgers and shakes was very appealing and nostalgic. I've only been here twice but I was not impressed either time. The food is not gourmet, I don't care what they tell you on the website and in the commercials. It's just not. I could get the same thing at Denny's.

I really don't like how crowded and noisy this place is. It was literally so loud the second time I went with my date that we couldn't even talk, hear each other, or enjoy our time together. It was a complete waste of money and for two days I regretted going there and spending my hard-earned cash on their overpriced food.

Furthermore, I understand that there's a full bar here but the servers should not be drinking. One of the waiters, who wasn't even mine, came over to my table and started talking to me and it was obvious that she had been drinking from her slurred speech. I will never waste my money here again."}
{"text":"Not too bad; I'd say its geared more towards kids, though.

PROS:  
Great Staff at all locations, every time that we've gone.
Food is okay (not awesome, but good)
Endless fries are always a win!
Unique atmosphere, sort of retro diner-esque.

CONS:
It is just sandwiches, but really that's what the restaurant is (to call it a \"con\" is debatable and sort of unfair).

Not sure if this is a pro or con, but its very kid-friendly and kid-oriented, IMO


The \"salmon\" burger was good (its actually pieces of salmon filet (not ground salmon patties), and I ordered some teriyaki sauce on the side--it was pretty darn tasty!
The Roast Beef au jus Sandwich was pretty good too--loads of meat!"}
{"text":"I mean, it's burgers. Lots of them. I probably haven't eaten at a Red Robin since I was a kid in California. The food was decent, however I'd recommend NOT spending the additional money for the garlic fries.

The reason I even meandered over here to write a review (because let's face it, I haven't written one in years) is to complain about their tableside kiosk system: Ziosk.

Look, I love expediting service as much as the next gal. What I don't love is when a product is placed in front of my four year old and I unexpectedly receive a $1.99 \"entertainment charge\" because she happened to click on a premium game.

This is an intentional design of the kiosk: place free games next to premium and make revenue by charging a nominal fee most customers won't dispute. My issue here is lack of disclosure.

Nowhere on the main page did it mention the inclusion of two types of games. 

Nowhere in the process did a pop-up ask for confirmation of payment.

My kid, innocent and tech-savvy as she is, poked around the offered games while we waited for our food. I did not mediate this as she is perfectly capable of navigating menus independently. Since I was the one who opened the games page and did not see a disclaimer about charges, I assumed there was no issue and handed it over.

The only reason I even assumed they were all free was because other kiosks I have encountered warn you before even entering the Games section that using them will incur a charge. It seems like Ziosk is capitalizing on this assumption/previous experience and it frustrates the hell out of me.

So...sorry Red Robin. Your burgers are decent, but out of principle I'm pretty much not returning until Ziosk is out of your restaurants."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar is always a good decision at these locations.  The bartenders always seem to be really nice and quick with their service.  This location was no exception!  Our server was extremely friendly and we felt welcome from the minute we sat down to the very end when we were walking out. 

I had my regular tavern double and he had the chicken sandwich.  Both of them were tasty and made as requested.  We shared a small onion ring starter, which was good until the very last onion ring, which tasted a little odd, probably was an outer piece of the onion and more bitter.  Not the end of the world all things considered.

The manager even stopped by to double check on how our meal was going and looked to be making her rounds to all the tables in the area. 

Overall: A
Sit at the bar and get a Mud Pie at the end!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to a Red Robin and what a fun place!  The bar area is open seating so we were able to by-pass a bit of a line to get seated in the regular part of the restaurant.  Our waitress was really nice while we took a second to review the menu and what we may want to try out.

I had the Tavern Double (a deal at $6.99) and he had the Chicken sandwich - both came with bottomless fries and ranch dipping sauce.  I was very pleased with the flavor of the burger and the level of toppings to burger ratio was perfectly done.  His chicken sandwich was deliciously done as well.  The breading was so yum.  

The bottomless fries were steak fries - which are notoriously hard to cook well considering that the outside cooks faster than the middles.  These were done decently - not my favorite, but not bad!  The ranch was really the pull for bringing these back up to good eats.  Who would have thought to combine ranch with fries?  Brilliant.  Fatty.  But brilliant.

Overall: A-
Packed and noisy, so be ready for that, but the food is delicious and the staff is friendly.  We will so be back for the ranch."}
{"text":"My kids love this place. However, as a waitress, I have never gotten good service here. I even reached out to management because of the lack of costumer service and never got a response back. I will never go back. I feel they are such a money making chain, they didn't care if they lost me as a costumer. Shame on you."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for the first time ever because he loves burgers so much. Our server is great but it was really Skyler who is the manager that was amazing. My husband accidentally spilt my beer over and it got all over the table and floor. We called over Skyler and he immediately cleaned it up and offered me another beer at no charge. I really appreciate the great service and we will definitely be back. The burger and fries were awesome!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food quality and service at this location.  Asked for more salad dressing and it took a long time.  Waited a long time to pay the bill.  Bathroom had no paper towels to dry off hands.  Manager was mildly apologetic.  Won't return to this location.  Red Robin changed their menu and presentation a few years ago and I haven't liked it much since.  The portions are much smaller now on smaller plates.  Red Robin used to be a weekly regular visit kind of place but not anymore."}
{"text":"We've been to Red Robin countless times, but since my daughter now has to be on a gluten-free diet, we weren't sure we would be able to visit as a family. It turns out that this location has a special menu available - including a gluten free bun! The waiter was very helpful and we had a good time."}
{"text":"Mom wanted a Burger for lunch, so we decided to head to Red Robin.  It's in our neighborhood and it's been a while since we were last here.   We like this place because of the variety of Burgers they have on the menu.  It's pretty extensive and creative.  The Bleu Ribbon Burger (Bleu Cheese, Chipotle Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion Strings, Onion Bun), $9.79 immediately jumped out at me when I browsed the menu, so I went for it.

Mom went for a Turkey Burger....she's been on a Turkey Burger kick lately.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og?select=zD0Th0NI9ydO5MA2DogVmg

The service was excellent, as usual, and the food came out quickly.  We requested our Burgers to be cut in half and they got it right.  I took one bite out of my Bleu Ribbon Burger and instantly became a fan....yum!  The Bleu Cheese and Onion Straws gave the Burger a unique flavor that tasted soooo good.  It left me wanting more when I was finished....which is the tell-tale sign for me that I enjoyed the grub.

Overall, the experience was very good.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Came alone sat at the bar enjoyed a brew with my burger. Bartender was real cool. But the price they want you to pay for a burger, should the bun crumble after each bite? Just a reminder after 2 years, why I've come here only twice."}
{"text":"No question, Red Robin is yummmy! But, the parking at this location is terrible! Please be aware of this if you are handicapped, injured or trying to pick up a to-go order in bad weather. There is no quick way in (or maybe even out?) of this building! 
The staff is friendly and the food is good!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with our four teenager girls.  Good atmosphere,  friendly ( bit clumsy) waiter, delicious burgers and onion rings to die for. 
The portions are generous, several sides are bottomless  ( I never remember asking for seconds).
Good solid chain."}
{"text":"We never got to sit down.  No one was there to greet us when we entered the place.  The hostess didn't show up until five minutes later.  The hostess wasn't prepared to seat anyone for dinner on a Friday night.  Does anyone work at this Red Robin?  There were plenty of booths available, but none of them had been bussed.  The hostess wanted to seat us in a tiny booth which would've been impossible for my 6'5\" husband to sit in.  We told her to forget seating us as we were going to eat someplace else."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a burger with my daughter and her friend so we went here.  We ordered apps and about 5 minutes later, our entree.  Apps came out quick and were pretty decent (jalapeno coins, onion rings and chips).  However, right on the heels of the apps came the entree's.  We had just started on the apps so the table was jam packed with food and dishes.  Take a tip and delay ordering your entree on a busy night.  They were clearly about turning tables, but the server was pleasant and not pushy.  I ordered the \"burning love\" burger.  Definitely not as hot and spicy as the description made it out to be, but decent which sums up the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great staff. Good food. Always a great place to grab a quick bite. Usually the whole crew can find something they like."}
{"text":"I don't understand how they have such horrible service. They even have those computers on the tables for apps and desserts and you can pay there too. So you would think the server would get to together. Nope. Specifically said we wanted apps first and to wait for our order to be in. Still 3 minutes after apps, plates come out. Then he offers to put them under the warmer. No! Gross!  The food is good here but I expect better service for what I pay."}
{"text":"Ooohhh how exciting! The \"new\" Red Robin - new look, new technology, new attitude. We were seated in the bar area, and let's just say the table setting is VERY intimate. But hey, the setting might be okay since you are in \"holding-hands distance\" with your neighbor to embrace each other while you embark on a horrible burger adventure. 

The first red flag was when we ordered and the server did not ask how we wanted our burger cooked. A \"gourmet\" burger place that doesn't ask what temperature you would like your burger? Word? Apparently the \"new\" Red Robin's patty is something similar to what you would find at McDonalds.

It seemed there was only one person working the bar area on a Friday night. This made for 10 minute beer service and 15 minute water service. I guess the \"new\" Red Robin calls for less servers.

Seemingly the new corporate rebranding has changed the food and service. Bring back \"old\" Red Robin!"}
{"text":"We came to this particular restaurant because I was in the mood for fries. Turns out, that's all they did right- that and the sweet peach tea. The waitress was sweet enough but our food came out after people who sat down AFTER we ordered (salmon burger and veggie burger and fries and broccoli). There was a change in shift so we got a new waitress who really listened to our concerns about the timing of our food. When the food finally came, both our burgers were dressed with limp, discolored arugula. Gross! I asked for fresh lettuce and got it right away, as well as another order of fries. My veggie burger grew cold while they waited on the salmon so I didn't enjoy it as much. The manager did comp our meal so we were very thankful and sure to leave a great tip, but I'd think twice about returning for more than the never-ending fries."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service for a group of 9. Maddie gave great suggestions and always kept our drinks and fries filled. I got the clucks and fries but with a twist - buffalo style. They were great. Wonderful night again at Red Robin!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries were overcooked, hard and dry.  They are thrifty wit silverware - we had to ask for spoons for our milkshakes, then ask for knives to cut our meals.  Sunday afternoon busy, so it was hard to get the attention of any waitstaff.  And they ignored the flashing \"Call Server\" light on the Ziosk.     Good shakes, burgers."}
{"text":"Service is terrible ... waitress was good it was not her fault but a party of 7 is not that big we waited over 45 minutes for our meal ... burgers were literally sitting out for a good 15 mins and went cold had them re made and they messed the re makes up too !! They need to staff the kitchen better and have a better system in place ."}
{"text":"I've been twice. The garden burger was uninspired. They need to find a better source for their buns. The caesar salad (either the \"Mighty\" size or the smaller side salad) was pretty lame: two times too much dressing.

The server's attitude seemed to be that quantity takes priority over quality (they kept asking my friend if he wanted refills of french fries (I tried one, found it disappointingly soggy, and had no more).

I see nothing to recommend at Red Robin."}
{"text":"I was really wanting a good burger for dinner so we decided to stop here for dinner. We were seated immediately and our drink orders taken. I decided to order the Whiskey BBQ burger which had aWhiskey BBQ sauce, onion straws, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheddar cheese. It came with bottomless steak fries which were also perfectly seasoned and hot. This is a huge burger, but it hit the spot! I pared it with a traditional margarita on the rocks with salt since it was Margarita Day! I loved the decor and the collage of pictures above our heads. The oversized Lego burger and milkshake were really neat too. They have trivia to play at your tables but you pay for the games. What I loved was you could order food, call your server and also pay for your check on the same trivia machine! This helped keep things moving and also quick to check out."}
{"text":"great burgers and a great place to go with kids. pretty quick service even when we go with a bigger group sometimes. love the Hawaiian heartthrob smoothie!"}
{"text":"After spending hours in Costco. I just wanted some meat, so I stopped in with my sister and 5 year old niece.

The staff was super friendly and the service was quick. 
However, I wasn't thrilled with my chicken sandwich. The bin was soggy and it was lacking something. The fries were tasty and the lemonade was decent.

Super bummed about the sandwich though. I didn't finish it and left hungry. 

Will I be back? Probably, it's in a wicked convenient location. But, I wasn't happy."}
{"text":"Short wait
Delicious food & fries
Super quick service
Friendly server"}
{"text":"Bad experience after not having been to a Red Robin for a couple years. Took 10nin for our server to come take drink order, another 5min to get water and a beer.

Ordered two burgers, both were okay and somewhat bland. My fiance's burger was severely undercooked. She sent it back to get one done with 'some pink' as originally ordered and it came back very 'well done' with zero pink.

Server was unapologetic and lethargic at best. Manger did take one burger off the tab, so at least they did that correctly. Took 15min after clearing table to get our bill. 

Will not be back to Red Robin for another 2 years."}
{"text":"If I could give this review more stars I would. I came to this red robin since it had opened but hadn't been here in about a year due to the service being so horrible. A new manager, Cody has taken over so I decided to try it out today with my boyfriend. I had a great experience!! Not only was I seated very quickly, but my sever Justin was phenomenal! He was very attentive, checked on us every few minutes and was very positive and upbeat. He constantly made sure we had refills and were taken care of. The food had tasted very fresh and overall my burger was delicious! I highly recommend this place and will be there all the time now! Thank you Cody and Justin! :)"}
{"text":"Typical burger and beer place.  Food is pretty good.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Arrived to host who sneezed on his wrist. Seated and found service to be extraordinarily weak. No water, but another waitress alerted us twice that our server will be with \"shortly\". It wasn't busy, but their computer input looked like a great place to hang out. Food was average and pricey with their signature Smoke and Pepper burger priced at $13.99. No thanks. Unlimited fries were served in a strange metal collar and were greasy and lukewarm. Awful experience. Save your $30 and go to In-n-Out as fast as possible."}
{"text":"So....Get in the mail. A gift card from the humiliation for $30.00. Are they kidding? Wendy, I guess it's okay to speak in a duragatory to women employees,and guests. Thank you Sun the manager.

 The conversation I had with a lawyer they found you amusing. I will be returning your cards back to you. Don't need your charity. 

Btw, I have cancer and in the hospital. 

This was my last meal for at least a month. 

Shame on you Red Robin. I hope people read this..."}
{"text":"Let's go to red robin they said.  They have really good burgers they said.  So I went there and got a bacon cheddar burger.  The waitress asked if I would like some pink or no pink.  I replied medium-rare (because beef is cooked rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, or well done).  Her reply was of course, not a problem.  We can get a lot of pink for ya.  Apparently the message got lost in the kitchen as my medium-rare burger arrived very well done and charred to a crisp with dark brown meat throughout the center and black meat (carbon) on the edge.  

If a burger place cannot distinguish between very well done and medium rare, they suck.  

I'll give them one extra star for serving hot french fries, though they were very bland.

Crappy burgers, a front of house not communicating with the back of house, and bland fries.  Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Thank you to the Management who looked up the items and informed me the sauce and buns were not Vegan. They switched out and gave me other options.
Awesome Customer Service!"}
{"text":"So my husband and two kids got here around 8:45 on a Sunday night (they're open till 10) place was pretty much empty Tried to order appetizer with server he referred me to the kiosk on our table and took me step by step on how to order my app and anything else we might need in case he wasn't around (his exact words) Umm.. where you going to be, we're your only table. I expected stellar service.Personal preference but I HATE the little table kiosk, it totally takes away from the server presentation and is very impersonal.Sadly disappointed.Notice the empty glasses.After we asked for refills they came after our meal arrived.Food was average.Fries were cold.We will probably return and give them another chance because we are huge Red Robin fans and this location is closer for us then Arrowhead.Definitely needs some work in the service department and no manager around to tell."}
{"text":"Horrible! We waited atleast an hour for our food. I watched 4 tables that arrived long after us receive their food before us but their excuse was the kitchen. So the kitchen apparently could get everyone else that showed ups food out but not ours. Then as I was sitting there waiting they sat a couple next to us at a table that had kids sitting at previously and they sat this poor couple at this table that had food and crap all over the floor. The poor guy had a bad knee and could have tripped on all the shit they left on the floor! Absolutely ridiculous. Next time we go to red robin it will most definitely NOT be this location! Absolutely horrible. I would recommend a different location for sure. Oh and I went to use the restroom and the only available stall jad feces all over the seat! Absolutely disgusting!"}
{"text":"They don't care about customers anymore.  I ordered my burger some pink. It was well done
 Sent it back.  The second burger was almost burnt delivered by the manager. No,apology.  No offer of a new entree. Pretty bad for a burger restaurant.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Regular solid place to go to indulge a burger binge. Preferably a guacamole and bacon burger~ don't shake your head at me. I ditched the bread. Ok most of it.
Oh, and I ate all the fries:/ btw they are bottomless. One serving was enough. 
Se fué la diéta"}
{"text":"I understand that you may not have avocados due to the shortage, but if you ask me if I want guacamole instead (odd since you don't have avocados but obv it's pre-made and comes from a container) and I say yes, it's really crappy to then CHARGE ME $2 FOR IT.  Any dish that normally comes with avocado should be cheaper if you don't have it. And to upcharge for bad guacamole as a substitute is just shameful.  I mean, come on.

This location is nice and clean and the staff is nice and helpful (our waiter was flummoxed by numerous tables but he tried), but the food wasn't as good as other RRs I've been to."}
{"text":"Went with my mom for lunch. I got the Chili Chili Cheeseburger. Was good, but nothing special. We also ordered the hummus plate and some onion rings. My mom got the BBQ chicken salad, BBQ on the side. Waitress was good. Kept the drink refills going and even gave us refills to-go. About as much to be expected from this place for being a chain. It was clean and they even cleared a booth for us right away to sit at because we didn't want to sit at a regular table. Wouldn't go out of my way to go to a Red Robin, but would definitely be back if option comes about."}
{"text":"I'm not really a burger kind of person but I came here for a birthday dinner on Sunday night. The menu is pretty much a variety of all types of burgers. They didn't have pictures for all of them but did have a description for them all. They also had salads and soups. I decided to go with the guacamole bacon burger and added an over easy egg. 

My burger was cooked just fine. The only downfall to this guacamole burger is that I didn't taste any guacamole. I looked at my burger and there was a very thin layer of guacamole spread on top of the bun but was covered by a bunch of lettuce. With all the different toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and bacon it was sad that I couldn't taste the main ingredient and the actual component that the burger is named by which is the guacamole. 

The fries were good and tasted better with the salt seasoning- that is your choice to use or not on the table. 

Donuts were ordered to our table for dessert. The donuts came with chocolate and strawberry dipping sauces and was covered in sugar. It was good but definitely too sweet for my palate. 

Not too sure if I would ever come to RR again for a burger being that I wasn't too satisfied this time around and for it being a gourmet burger joint I expected to be wowed"}
{"text":"Started out with trying to tell the waitress that my husband and I are both military veterans as she was explaining to him the \"veterans menu\" and saying what he could order and that \"they\" can order whatever they want. She kept going.... anyway. Icalled it to her attention again saying. \"Excuse me... we are both veterans. Can you show me what page that menu is in so I can choose too?\" Ignored again. Then was served wings that were still frozen. At this time the waitress felt bad enough to send the manager out to \"take care of it and address it. The manager came out apologized and offered us \"fries while you wait for your other food.\" Mind you, fries are \"bottomless\" aka  \"Free\" with our meals. I said no, we already have some coming. Then our food came out. My fries were from the bottom alright. The bottom of the fry basket. They were crunchy fry bits with pieces of regular fries and steak fry bits for more than 60% of the serving. The waitress came back again. I showed/told her what I got and that I was highly disappointed. She sent the manager back out who then acknowledged the Bad fries, apologized and then offered more fries! And then stated \"don't worry, we took care of your burgers and discounted he rest of your bill. I told her that our burgers were already free being that we are BOTH veterans. We got our bill and guess big surprise!! Only my husband's burger was taken off (because he's obviously the only veteran) with a military discount on the test of our meal. I should also state that my wallet was on the table with my military ID showing while speaking to the manager and waitress. Yes, little black women can serve too! Not saying it was about race but Jesus!! Get it together!!!!! They straightened out the bill with my husband because I couldn't bare to sit there for anymore BS! Never going back to this location again! Never did they offer a free dessert or to take care of the tab after such bad service. The waitress honestly outside of ignoring what I was saying (possibly just not hearing me) wasn't the problem. In the end she grites to work with whatever she could seem to do I guess but this place/management needs to pull their head out! This was our second time ever. First time amazing! This time . Never going back!"}
{"text":"We gave this place one more shot, but now we will never come back.  Reasons why as follows:

1. 15 minutes before the waitress (Lisa) took our drink order.
2. 20 minutes before she brought them back and took our food order.
3. After an additional 20 minutes we flagged down a passing hostess to ask her to get our waitress.
4. 10 minutes later....no Lisa, so we left.
5. The manager did chase us down when we were almost to Macy's but it was too little too late."}
{"text":"Horrible to go service. I can't tell you how many times I've tried to call them for an order and they just don't pick up the phone. And we're not talking peak hours here. I've started having to go to one that's about 10 miles further out because this store is so bad."}
{"text":"We had a very nice waitress. We took a Banzai Salad back home for our daughter. It had a black type of beetle bug crawling around in it.  What else can I say, they must not wash their greens. Lost our appetites, pretty sick."}

Waited 20 minutes for 2 simple burgers and fries. served with small piece of lettuce, onions strings not even a slice, and two paper thin unripe tomatoes. Nothing on the buns and nothing like mayo or mustard on tables. GET A CLUE PEOPLE.  Terrible service and very marginal food. Had similar experiences several times at other location near 99th ave and McDowell. they have lost me and my family forever."}

Melissa waited us and was exceptional."}

{"text":"Before I was a Yelper I used to send feedback directly to the business when it was either very positive or very negative.  In 2009 I sent Red Robin a very positive review of this very location.  The service on that particular day was some of the best i've ever had anywhere and Red Robin deserved to hear about one of their employees that really gave me a fantastic experience.  Unfortunatly, now, I'm a Yelper and will write my review here - Everyone will hear about it.

Red Robin, Red Robin, Send Service Right Over.

I was with a party of 10 so I could easily understand the 35 minutes to wait for a table. We were seated on a long 'surfboard' table near the bar area.  We were cool with that.  From here things went very different than they did in 2009 and It would probably be easier for me to compare the two.  This is going to be fun, ready?

2009 server:
This server was pleasant, it looked like she was really enjoying being there. She greeted us with a smile and told us about the specials going on.  She said hello to our daughter who was two at the time - It was nice.  She took our drink orders and came back with them pretty quickly.  
2011 server:
'Hi, Can I get you drinks?'  Not very friendly when complared to the first.   She too took our drink orders and came back with them pretty quickly.  

2009 server:
After she took our meal orders she asked us if we wanted to start with some french fries.  That was pretty awesome - they're  unlimited & refillable so why not - Nice thinking 2009 server!  
2011 server: 
She took our meal orders


2009 server: 
When our order arrived my daughter asked my wife for her pickle and the server over heard this.  She offered to bring my daughter her very own pickle! WOW!  
2011 server:
Server wasn't friendly.  \"Your order is the next ticket up\",  Drinks ran dry.  She started walking away as we were talking to here.  Excuses but no apologies. Restroom were littered with hand towels.  First batch of fries were cold and undercooked.

2009 server:
I was hooked.  At that moment even before eating I knew it was letter writing time.  This server deserved to be recognized.  This server was the reason we continued to go back to Red Robin on a much more frequent basis.
2011 server:
Caused me to write this review.  Granted, I've been there many many times since 2009 but the level of service has declined each visit.  As a result the time between each visit to Red Robin has increased.

We'll try again in 2013! :)"}
{"text":"I love Red Robin! The monroville location has excellent servers, almost always. Today my server's name was Liz and she was fantastic.  The food was top notch and the atmosphere is fabulous.  I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I love this location! Always have excellent service and wonderful food! Today, the chef brought me free shrimp because she didn't like how the first batch came out, although I thought they were great! I'll take extras anytime!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. I'm am so happy that they provide gluten free buns. Beyond that I'm not happy with the products or service.
Ordering from an iPad -esque screen  does not provide the initial relationship with the server. I had to raise my hand for a drink. I'm not an obnoxious customer, I promise! It's just that I need a drink! Isn't that server 101? There were so many people standing around tonight (not getting me a drink).
The fries are never ending but the servers don't ask if you want more. This is due to the iPad-esque ordering screen. You'd think with this assistant that they would be able to free up some time. But honestly, who wants frozen steak fries?"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep eating here the food was burned and I got a side of ranch what to look blood in I would not highly recommend this one"}
{"text":"I have a toddler. Toddlers are loud and void of restaurant manners. Thankfully, Red Robin is loud and doesn't expect toddlers to have manners. You can order your sticky-fingered kiddo a grilled cheese for $1.99 without a side and the high-fructose corn syrup beverage. All a sticky-fingered kiddo really needs is a grilled cheese anyway. The staff is (mostly) attentive and helpful. Before I had my babe I never thought I would frequent a Red Robin, but the toddler-friendly choices in my 'hood are not bountiful. You do what you gotta do. And honestly, I love the burger with the pineapple and teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. .the last time we have came but the service is sooo...bad...to bad good food.. what a  shame..15 minutes no service. ..walked out..."}
{"text":"We come here often & it's really hit & miss on the type of service you'll receive. Often times your food comes out with your appetizer. I really like you get free things randomly in emails plus for your birthday & 10th burger free. The endless fries are great too."}
{"text":"We visited Red Robin on Chandler Blvd. by Chandler Mall tonight. We ordered our food about 10 minutes after 8pm. It was just my husband and I. We contemplated getting up and leaving because we noticed how filthy dirty the restaurant was. Bathrooms had trash all over, the restaurant floors were so dirty - used napkins on the floor and tons of food all over the floor, and right next to me, some white smeared something on the booth that I didn't see when we were seated. (See pic). Many tables went in-bussed the entire visit. However since we were very hungry we figured we would eat quick and go and try not to touch anything. Bad choice! 

Both of our meals came out incorrect and nothing was done to rectify mine. I took 1 single bite and realized that even though I asked for no mayonnaise it had it anyway. My husband asked for a side salad instead of fries - he got fries. A person (manager I believe) brought the side salad out right away. Our server Justin took my chicken sandwich back and it took long enough for my husband to eat his entire meal - fish and chips and salad. I finally asked for my replacement meal to go because we couldn't wait any longer. I left having not eaten but the one bite and some fries. 

I have to say I was disappointed that not even a simple apology from our server or a manager was given. And that I paid for my meal that I didn't get to enjoy. Nothing was done to rectify the situation for a meal I didn't even get to eat. Unfortunately we left a $0 tip. I felt bad but why should I have left feeling bad? My guess or hope was that they were understaffed hence the slow service and dirty tables and floors. 

In all, we were there for about an hour and 10 minutes. I won't return to that location again. I'm a Red Robin Loyalty Rewards member so I usually enjoy it but tonight it was anything but enjoyable. If you're in the mood for RR, I suggest going to a different location."}
{"text":"They do a good job here. Hubby & I each have our favorites and we ain't budging. Huge menu of burgers & other sandwiches. Options for other sides than fries & they are happy to remove topping on your sandwich you may not care for. You can't go wrong for a standard chain meal here. Coupled with paying with Ziosk you can get in & out of here efficiently. 

The hidden secret to chain restaurants like this (so Chili's would be in this category) is if it's just the two of you, request or seat yourself in the bar area. People often don't think of that option so waitstaff may not get the tips. Because of this we always get excellent service.

Finally, they have a generous rewards program offering a full meal after so many visits instead of just an appetizer or dessert that we'd never take advantage of. Besides rewards we get emails offering worthwhile discounts. Keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Usually I have had good food and service but this time it was just ok. I think the server had too many tables and just could not keep up. Everyone was very polite and nice but we ordered the onion ring tower as an appetizer but it was brought halfway through dinner but he did make up for it by taking it off the bill =)

This time I ordered the teriyaki chicken sandwich which was completely messy and just tasted ok. I usually order burgers and should have stuck to that. You can never go wrong with a burger at Red Robin usually. Also the steak fries could have been cooked a little more. This is the first time that I thought the fries didn't taste good and I've never had bad fries at Red Robin until now.

I will go back to Red Robin but maybe just not this location and will definetly order a burger next time!"}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was gross. I ordered the Red Robin Royale and it comes with a sunny side egg and my egg still had the white part uncooked. It was disgusting. The egg was broken apart on my burger and it was very unpleasant to the eyes. The first batch of fries I get was cold and hard, but after my refill, it was great. Service was great. Food came in on time and my drink was always full but the food was just unacceptable to me."}
{"text":"I had not taken my family to RR in quite some time.  Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.

Our entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.

The fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, \"No, I already got this half full bowl.\"

A few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entrée.

$58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?  No thanks RR.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I have come a few times since my last review and have had much better service. The food was also prepared better, though that part is still inconsistent. It's still not a favorite, but it is a place I would be willing to suggest now."}
{"text":"I am truly pleased to see this place running so efficiently. Our server, Brian, was excellent-very attentive. Our food was great. My burger was perfectly cooked which is rare. It's usually too dry or too bloody, but it was done to perfection this time. The place is cleaner than most and the management must be new or something. They've really stepped it up at this location. Really enjoyed having lunch with my niece here."}
{"text":"6 star experience. Food is delicious, unique and aplenty here. Burgers are of good value and the bottomless fries are excellent with their ranch dressing. A very unique experience all the way around with this Red Robin restaurant and certainly would love to dine here again. Friendly faces, good, positive attitudes, attentive wait service and staff and delicious foods are just a few words to describe this Red Robin location. A+"}
{"text":"So impressed by the manager Katie . The wife and I work in customer service in Las Vegas, and Katie was the embodiment of what a good f&b manager should be. RedRobin is lucky to have such a valued employee and we hope that she is recognized for her personality and care she have us. Employees like her restore our faith in the chain restaurant industry. Thank you Red Robin for employeeing such a quialty staff member. 

Best Reguards,

{"text":"A little disappointed at the wait time and there was like 10 tables open. The food was good. I think my royal Red Robin burger is starting to look small. That's my go to burger every time I visit here. The kids enjoyed their food. Had to send my egg back. It wasn't medium well."}
{"text":"We love Red Robin. It's my kids favorite restaurant and we eat here 2 times a week. The service is fantastic and the food is good too."}
{"text":"If we could give half stars this would be a solid 2.5. Living near Madison, we are super blessed with such a wide range of local options I do my best to stay away from chain restaurants. Don't get we wrong there is always the time a place for them. 

Both of my kids enjoy coming to RR, I am not sure if it is for the free balloons or the food but either way they ask for it every once in a grand while. 

The past 3 times I have been here a server or someone drops something. You hear a loud crashing a breaking sound and you just cringe. The first time was during food delivery to a few tables down. Glass everywhere, food everywhere. I felt bad for the server who came over to apologize making sure we didn't get hit with anything. 

This last time we came I ordered the Marco Polo chicken sandwich (this is the 2nd time I tried the sandwich) and it just wasn't good. The taste of it was off. The first time I tried it, I loved it! My BF ordered the guac burger. He had to really inspect it to see if there was even guacamole on it. He too said it wasn't good at all, the bottom bun was a soggy mess as well. 

My son always orders the hamburger which he loves and mandarin oranges. My daughter orders the mac n cheese and mandarin oranges. They both do not like the fries here."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. 7 mins before acknowledged by waitstaff. Table was dirty and sticky. 30 mins wait for apps. 15 minute wait between receiving apps and waitstaff coming to take order. 6 mins to receive silverware to eat app. 45 mins wait time to receive one burger and one basket of fried cod. 

No drink refills. No condiments as requested. No napkins entire meal -had to use our baby's burp cloth. Never took finished plates from table. Oh but DID tell us to sign up for the loyalty program once check was brought. 

Pick up payment and bring receipt wait time - under 2 mins.

Didn't catch waiters name but was very tall African American man with blueish eyes. Please retrain this guy or give him fewer tables. He was apparently overwhelmed.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"The husband and I went Super Bowel 52! It was awesome!!! The burgers were delicious!!! The fires kept coming!!! And the desert was actually the size of the picture!"}
{"text":"Today I got the taco tavern burger and asked to substitute the fries for mac and cheese and she said yes and it would be bottomless mac and cheese to let her know if I wanted more. I ordered my second serving and received a completely diff type of mac and cheese I think it was a kids. So I told the server ans got the correct kind. Once we paid I looked at the bill and I was charged the substition fee which I knew I was going to be charged, but I was also charged an extra 2.99. 
Last time I was at this location I ordered a salad and asked for tbe dressing on the side. I never recieved any dressing at all. The server never came by to see if we needed anything so I wasnt able to ask for my dressong until everyone was finished eating. I took my salad home and ate it with my dressing. It was good I just wish I could have eaten it at the table with everyone else."}
{"text":"This place is delicious the burger with fried egg is my favorite. The food is consistently great and staff are friendly. I just wish to go orders didn't take as long but hey it's crowded because it's great and fresh!"}
{"text":"This Red Robin has really turned it around in the last year or so. I've been several times in the last few months and even once they ran out of the new veggie burger. The manager felt so bad, she wanted to make something for me. I declined and had a grilled cheese instead, but it was very nice to know that she cared about my dining experience. She also did not charge me for the sandwich even though I did not ask for a discount and would have been happy to pay based on the service alone."}
{"text":"Any place that will give me as many french fries as I can consume is  A-OK with me!

This RR location is conveniently located right across from the Peoria Sports Complex, making it a great spot to grab some food and drinks before seeing my San Diego Padres show off their skills during Spring Training.  

While RR is known for their burgers (and they looked really good!), I chose the Chicken Caesar Wrap.  Maybe this wasn't the best idea.  The first half was very tasty, with a nice balance of chicken, parmesan and caesar dressing all wrapped in a spinach tortilla.  However, the second half was lacking a key ingredient - the chicken!  It was bite after bite of lettuce.  Lettuce, lettuce, lettuce.  I should have ordered a burger.  I consoled myself by continuing to consume fries.  Glorious fries.

The staff is friendly and attentive - our waitress Jazmin took great care of us - fry basket and beer glasses were never empty.  I would have mentioned the lack of chicken in my wrap, but after all those fries, it really didn't matter.  I am sure she would have corrected the issue though, with a smile.

Friendly staff, fries (!) and the proximity to my Padres will convince me to give RR another try before Spring Training ends.  And this time, I will order a burger."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago with the family. We've been to this Red Robins a few times (birthdays, events, casual). A lot of their customers usually consist of the College crowd, rarely any \"families\" that eat there because of the mature-atmosphere.

Waiters/Waitresses are nice, they're always on top on refilling your glass, asking if you need anything, the stuff you see in basically every other sit-down restaurant.

When I went, I had their new Bourbon Burger, it wasn't that great, it tasted like Chili's (ugh) burger with fried onions on it. Except the Red Robin fryers actually remembered no mayo or tomatoes on my burger (unlike Chili's), so I was very happy about that. The Bourbon wasn't very flavorful, it was messy, but the picture already shows it's not a clean burger to eat! Once I added the Red Robin \"special seasoning\" on it, then it got really good - halfway through the burger... I did not get the \"unlimited steakfries!\" special... but I don't know if it's because our waitress was busy with a large group of college kids who were there for a birthday and simply forgot. My sister had the Royal Red Robin (with a fried egg on top). She liked it, but nothing to write home about.

Previously, before the burgers, I would order the Fish and Chips, the fish are nicely fried (can't burn deep fried stuff though huh, lol!) and crisp. The Fish itself are very large pieces, so you get the bang for your buck on this item! I would recommend sharing it with another since you get four pieces of fried fish.

I would defiantly come back to this Red Robin though, don't get me wrong, but I would suggest going with a more adult group that doesn't have a lot of children in tow... It is more popular with college kids after-all."}
{"text":"I have not had the best impressions in my 3 or 4 visits here.   Everything from poor service to poor food.  It's been hit and miss in any area, although when brought to the management's attention, was appropriately handled."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good burger place. They have a lot of options for toppings which is nice. Their French Dip sandwich is also very good. But I mostly enjoy the steak fries. These are my favorite type and RR gives you free refills on fries. A little RR seasoning on them and they are even better. 

Our main issue is that the service can be hit or miss. Sometimes the service is great and we get our food fast and fresh. Other times we wait forever for our food and rarely see our server. Strangely it doesn't seem to matter if they are busy or not. 

I'll keep coming back and roll the dice on service."}
{"text":"in general, red robin isn't fantastic.  it's a bunch of ingredients over-piled to make you forget that the meat is barely there.   
however, my mom heard good things about it and wanted to check it out.  i'd never been to this location before and i won't be going back.
it was slow when we arrived and we were sat right away, but despite asking for a high chair, never got one.  about 5 minutes later someone came up and i thought they were our server.  they said our server would be right over and didn't even take a drink order.  i asked if we could at least get a high chair and they brought one right over.  still no server, but there was a manager that walked by several times oblivious to the fact that we had been sitting there now nearly 10 minutes with a restless toddler and NO DRINKS!  even if a place is busy, waiting 10 minutes for a simple \"what can i getcha to drink\" is unacceptable, but there were MAYBE a total of 5 tables occupied.  we finally left, still without being properly greeted.  i was going to ask to speak to a manager at the host stand, but there was no one there and the manager was behind the bar, shooting the breeze with employees.  so i guessed that would have been a pointless move.  

so, if you absolutely MUST have an over-garnished, under-meated burger, please please consider going to a different location."}
{"text":"Good food, however in inevitably every time we go there which is almost once a month the kitchen or the wait staff gets our order wrong.  Shame on us for continuing to go back but we keep hoping the next time we go they will get it together."}
{"text":"The remodel is nice! No more screaming children all the way across the restaurant reverberating back at ya. Ahhhh! No more garlic parm fries as we knew them... dry seasoning and parm? They used to be tossed with chopped garlic. R.I.P. GARLIC PARM FRIES~tear~"}
{"text":"Worst. Meal. Ever.

Let's start off with the decor. It looks like you have time warped into the year 2000. This restaurant has not been updated yet. We sat down right away and although there were plenty of tables open they put us a half booth next to the kitchen and the table top and menus were super sticky.

It took almost 10 minutes for the server to take our order, so by then we were ready to place our food and drink order at the same time. Then we sat and waited. And waited. And waited. They rest had barely any guests (I should have realized just by that) 30 min later still no food. The waitress never came over once to say the food was almost ready. She did bring us napkins and knives, no forks. Since the food was taking so long she brought over a thing of fries, which none of us ate, we don't like RR Fries, and she might have figured that out since none of us ordered fries with our meals. Finally the food came out. My husband's medium-rare burger was charcoal. My 9 year old daughter found a hair in her mandarin oranges (pubic hair size, BARF), and my Cobb salad was brought out with tartar sauce instead of blue cheese dressing. Who does that?! We all lost our appetites by the very site of the food, and couldn't wait to pay and leave. 

This whole restaurant needs a makeover along with the staff. I did observe (since I was facing the kitchen) that none of the cooks where hair nets on their head or beards (so frickin nasty). I would never on God's green earth ever eat here again. Unfortunately, after this experience I am not sure I can eat at another RR for a very very long time.

RR Corporate should really take a look at this restaurant and re-evaluate.

Feeling like I have to hurl."}
{"text":"We came here it was super packed but we didnt have to wait too long. Maybe about 5 minutes, that was good. Server was very nice and friendly. We ordered the half size onion rings they are so good!!! Especially the dipping sauce they come with very good. I got a Margarita for a drink with prickly pear, i forget the name but it was very very delicious and tasted very fresh, it was different, but nice. I also got the burnin love burger and I must say there was absolutely no burn. It comes with pepper jack cheese fried jalapenos and a big serano grilled jalapeno on top. Not one bit of hot in that burger. I mean, thats the whole idea behind it right? \"burning love\" not very good. Fries were cold that sucked. My son got macaroni and cheese with mandarin oranges and loved it! i tasted it and it wasnt much flavor but if my son ate it, im happy. My family and I had a nice time here, The food was okay and the service was good. I will be coming here again"}
{"text":"I have been going to various Red Robin restaurants  since about 1990 and have for the most part been satisfied with the food and service.

Today however, this was not the case. This is the second time that I have been to this location and was a little underwhelmed the first visit by the service, not the food. I know this happens so decided to stop by here to satisfy a burger craving.

We were seated and waited 12 minutes before we were approached by our server. I was shocked that she was our server because she had been assisting the two neighboring tables and never acknowledged us. Anyway...she took our drink orders and returned a few minutes later with the drinks and took our food order. I ordered my usual ( cheeseburger with bleu cheese, cooked well) the husband ordered the same . The lady that delivered the food was very nice and offered to get us ranch for our fries...that was nice of her.

My burger had a cold bun...I frowned and thought..well..as long as the meat is cooked and hot I can overlook it, and it was and I dug in. The husband took a bite and spit his out...it was cold..the bun and the burger, plus it was raw inside...not a little pink....it was raw. We got our servers attention after about 10 minutes ( she only had 2 other tables by the way). She apologized and offered to correct the situation...the new burger was delivered and was fine. 

By this time we had been out of drinks for a while and really needed to quench our thirst...but our server was nowhere to be found. She finally comes over..after being prompted by us raising our hands...LOL...why did I raise my hand??? Imma dork. We let her know we would like some refills on our drinks and some extra fries...away she goes.5 minutes later our fries arrive...not form her...from another worker. We waited...waited....waited....20 minutes have now passed. We see our server offer to box the people's food next to us, she brought their check, she served another table their refills, came back to the other table and bullshitted for a few minutes. At this point I was pissed and saw a manager and motioned for him to come over..explained the ordeal...and he comped 50% of the bill...thanks Alex that was nice of you...I wish we could have left you the tip and not her. He brought us the check...she totally avoided us for the rest of the time we were there.

So...Alisha....your job is to be a server. This means that you take food and drink orders, deliver food, refill drinks, and make sure that we have a pleasant dining experience. I know that I pride myself in my job...and when I make a mistake I will be the first to admit and try to make ammends. I am not being harsh or rude...this is just basic skills that a person in this job should have. I know not everyone will have a knock out personality...or huge boobs, or a great smile. But Alisha...come on ...you could have at least apologized for the oversight.

The conclusion is that I will NEVER go to this particular RED ROBIN...thanks to Alisha...it would just be awkward to have to see her again. I will continue to go to the one off 99th and McDowell...and then soon they will have one even closer to me...OOH JOY !!!

P.S. The one star is for the nice manager that genuinely felt bad about our experience and the nice lady that offered the ranch."}
{"text":"I go to red Robin a few times a year with the kids at their request, and usually have decent experience with the food and service. This particular burger treck was done as a result of a free burger offer for my son's 15th birthday.

After the experince of my husband's meal and my own...I have decided that burger's are the ONLY choice here for me personally.

The husband ordered the salmon fish and chips and was pealing off the mushy and greasy batter after the second bite. After doing this we almost could not tell if this was salmon or some breed of white fish...it was so pale and lethargic we were not even sure it was salmon...however we were assured by our server it was legit. I tried a bite it was not good at all.

I ordered their \"steak\" sliders. Upon taking mu first bite I almost ripped out my 2 front teeth. Not only was the meat full of grissle, bit the taste and texture of the meat made me gag. These were not edible and I asked our server for a replacement (which he did gladly) and was told by the server that this happens a lot with sliders ( the grissle). My alternate was a cheeseburger with bleu cheese ( this was fine). 

This was not a horrible experience, I just will stick to their burger menu in the future.

P.S. The visit was also made more exciting by a female employee sitting at their of the restaurant crying hysterically for about 10 minutes and then proceeded to curse out someone on her cell phone !!"}
{"text":"While the food is basic but good, service is subpar. This is the second time I've had the same server in the bar area and he's only ok. It takes him about 10 minutes just to acknowledge me and take my drink order. Then once he puts the food order in, he never stops by to check on me until he delivers the check.  So I don't get a refill on my tea (huge pet peeve - really, does it take that long to refill a glass?) and he never checks to see his the meal is.

I don't understand why service is always treated as an afterthought. And why a single diner gets ignored ....

I'm not sure if I will come back to this location, or any other, after this."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night. It seems like they updated their menu in response to the new calorie requirements. Their menu is a lot smaller and they got rid of my beloved cheese curds!  

We got standard burgers and both chose to upgrade our fries to chili cheese fries. It was delicious!! Totally worth the extra couple bucks.  The fries upgrade makes them not bottomless, but we didn't need one anyway! We left completely stuffed. 

Our food was great but we did not get our appetizer - Cheese Sticks and Breaded Zucchini on the Jump Starter Double, until after our meal arrived. One word of advice - do not get the zucchini! It was cut into large spears and the what was left of the breading tasted like a funnel cake. At least 50% of each spear had no breading, and it just tasted like you bit into a hunk of boiled zucchini.

Red Robin is our go-to place. Even with the zucchini hiccup, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Red Robin has great burgers and great food.  However I would avoid their doh nuts not worth the high price they are pretty much tasteless!   Stick to their other desserts."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food.  Love this place. Waiter was very prompt to take our drink orders. He brought out fries to keep my child busy while we waited for food.  That was very nice,  thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is a chain, so I'll keep this brief.  The burgers are just ok.  Nothing special and definitely don't come anywhere near my Best Burgers of Phoeinx list.  

I had the Royal Burger or whatever it is called.  Look, it's the one with the egg on it ok?  Anyway, the egg is way too done.  I'd prefer over easy or medium at the most, but this sucker was way over hard.  Not a fan so I 86ed the thing.  Way too much mayo on it too.  The fries are decent, mozarella sticks too.  Nothing amazing here.  I did enjoy the chocolate shake though.

The two times I have been to this location the service has been pretty poor.  Nothing I'm in the mood to get into right now, but the hostess was lame and the waitress subpar.

Funny tip: when they ask if you've been to a Red Robin before.  Say no.  They all over react like it's the craziest thing that you've never been to a Red Robin before.  I don't see the big deal if you haven't and their reaction is annoying, but now that you know what they'll do it is fun to mess with them and see how they over react.

Want great burgers?  See my list of Phoenix's best burgers. Try one of those places and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we really enjoy a burger here if it is done correctly!

With that said .... every time we come here they ask if we want pink or no pink - we say pink and get a well done over cooked burger. This is all after waiting 30+ min for our food to come out in the first place!! It's not like it has happened only 1-2 times. 

Our server was nice but sooooo slow!!

Asked to speak to a manager and he didn't care about anything. He offered to remake the burgers, as he should have, but didn't really care that it happened in the first place !!

Overall, not a stellar burger place anymore. Unfortunately, the quality has changed for the worse"}
{"text":"Hamburger heaven!  Juiciest burgers ever and the best combination of toppings I've seen in a while.  I particularly like the black and blue burger I think it's called.  Comes with onion strings and blue cheese crumbles...to die for!  As with all Red Robin locations...endless fries....enough said.  I just wish the fries were of the shoe string type and not the steak style but no worries, still great.  My girlfriend and I stopped in at 1:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed so that's always a good indicator that the food is really good.  The service was fine, seating took a little bit, but nothing to really complain about and the food took a little longer than expected to reach the table but again, they were busy!

Still one of my favorite hamburger spots...EVER :)"}
{"text":"I ordered lunch take out whiskey burger, fries and spinach/artichoke dip thru Grubhub two days ago..  Due to how filling the burger was, I decided to save the dip for dinner....
    The burger was hot and fresh but sooo disappointed because they put grilled onions on it instead of onion straws! (which is one of my favorite parts!). They put so many grilled onions on there I could have made a blooming onion out of them! (If I would have breading on them like it should have had!) After pulling most of them off, the burger was delicious! Come on cooks...get it right...not so hard to tell the difference in GRILLED onions and onion STRAWS! Next time I would ask for extra BBQ sauce on the side tho...not enough on it for my liking. (I consider that my fault so no minus stars!)
     The fries were IN A CUP?? The burger in a nice container where it stayed hot, but the fries were in a cup in the bag and were cold by the time they were delivered. Really? In a cup on the side? PLENTY of room in that big plastic container with the burger!  I was happy they added a side packet of seasoning for the fries tho! One Star Bonus!
     I specifically asked for NO ONION or tomato on the artichoke dip. ... HM... SURPRISE! Lots of little onions peeking at me when I opened the dip at dinner! Should have known after the cooks not knowing the difference of onion straws vs grilled onions they wouldn't know what NO ONIONS on the dip would mean either. 
      The small container was only HALF FULL of dip and after picking all the little pieces of onion off, less than half was left.  I only needed 5 of the 20 chips they included to eat the small portion of dip but at least they were fresh and salted.
      5 stars for grubhub delivery but 2 stars (generous) for Red Robin. The burger was good but it looks like I am in the majority with yelpers here.... if they could get the order right, the food is really good! CYA!"}
{"text":"The service here today was pretty bad.  Not only was it nearly impossible to get someone over to our table at any point during our meal, when someone did come, our order was completely wrong, the food was not good, and I never could get a drink refill.  I'm not sure what the problem was- I saw plenty of people stocking the bar, wandering around, and cleaning glasses.  The manager offered to remove the item from the bill that we didn't order, and then she forgot.  Overall, I would not come here."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the wife, the service was great and the burgers were good. I really enjoyed myself here, I will likely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Red Robin since living in Anchorage. That was over twenty years ago; I was rather young. While I didn't remember the flavors, I did remember my experience fondly. This goes to show that memories as a child can be skewed somewhat. The interior decor is an over-the-top tchotchky reminiscent of a restaurant one might find at a theme park, i.e. Disney World.  On the meal for this visit:

Clam chowder
Prime Rib Sandwich
French Onion Soup
Chicken Pesto Pasta

I am a very big fan of foods that are layered, but in RR's case I must make an exception. When that layering includes being overseasoned and lacking flavor something is wrong. The people people cooking the meals must not like the flavor of the base ingredients with as much seasoning salt as they use. I was dehydrated for quite some time after having finished my meal. 

I really don't understand how I could have liked this restaurant as a child, especially considering I can get better tasting items out of a can or the freezer. Stouffers makes a better chicken pesto pasta at a much lower price. There are just too many other better restaurants in the area to consider returning."}
{"text":"Had the October fest Burger.
Yes, really tasty. 
Filling for a big guy like me. Steak Fry a bit salty, but OK
Thanks  Rocky 
Good suggestion."}
{"text":"I was here for a business dinner recently and loved their new hummus plate.  They put grilled zucchini on it and had some fresh jicama which was awesome.  I wasn't in the mood for BBQ at the time but so I ordered a turkey burger which came on a whole wheat bun and some steamed broccoli.  I love the healthy options.  Thanks to Red Robin for helping to fight the battle of the bulge.  Just make sure you bring lots of will power when come here because it's easy to blow it...especially with the desert menu!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyable eating at this place, it's runned very well...service is great.  And the burgers are awesome.  Very laid back atmosphere and you leave there feeling full."}
{"text":"I do really like RR for the kids.  Lots to look at.  They like to \"play\" with the games. I got the Blue Ribbon Burger- very good.  I also love the bottomless fries- we always get them right away.  Speaking of fries they need to go back the basket fries and not the the metal containers.  These containers are WAY to fancy for Red Robin.  
My husband who is a vegetarian also liked there burgers that you can sub with a veggie burger- he likes the Burning love.
The con... the service is slow.  They really need to work on the service."}
{"text":"First time at a Red Robin. Went in for their specialty limited time only Oktoberfest Burger. It did not disappoint. Ingredients were fresh, and the burger itself was tasty. Lots of menu choices - I only wish the pretzel bun was a regular choice. Most of all we were impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant. Perhaps because it was relatively new, it was not very busy at the beginning of the lunch \"hour\". Waitress was attentive, honestly friendly, and very helpful (wish I remembered her name). I really liked that the tables were high, so you don't have to bend over to eat. (Parents should love this as it keeps your children from leaning their elbows on the table! ;)"}
{"text":"When you order a bacon guacamole burger, it should have GUACAMOLE on it rather than a green painted bun. That's THREE times this location skimped on the guac. To be fair, our server brought out two containers of guacamole, but I mentioned beforehand that I wanted my burger to have plenty of guac, not green colored buns. Not sure why this location does this, but another nearby locale did as well until I brought it up to management and I've had zero problems there since. That's my favorite burger and both me and my guests who've gone there ordering identical burgers have been shorted. :/

Is this a CHAINWIDE decision?? If so, Red Robin corporate will hear from me. I'm sorry, but green mustard-like coating with tons of shredded lettuce to disguise the NON-guacamole topping doesn't cut it with this girl. Been a Royalty member for years and that's my fave burger. Otherwise, Red Robin's food is good. Salads here are superb, except if you order the Avocado, you get two slivers. Does AVOCADO really cost all that much?? El Pollo Loco gives at least HALF of an avocado in their salads - and that's a DRIVE-THRU order. 

Good service - just frustrated at not getting what is printed on their menu and described. Not good for the brand. I'll be in touch with regional or corporate management. Sad to see a restaurant chain such as this cheat their customers. Thankfully, we had a good server, but our burgers got cold before the guac was brought out to us. Disappointed. :(

PS - if you order the Bacon Guacamole  Cheddar Cheeseburger, make sure to INSIST upon them serving your guac on the SIDE. Then you get AMPLE amounts of guac. Seriously, Red Robin - stop cutting corners to save pennies in deceiving your customers."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Red Robin b/c my friends seemed to rave about it.  I wasn't disappointed!  I had the Burnin Love Burger b/c I love food with a kick to it, and it was delish.  I asked for the meat to be cooked medium-well, not a fan of the red and bloody.  Overall, I had no complaints - it was flavorful and tender and all around a delicious burger.  I'd definitely go to this Red Robin again when I'm craving some burger action.  This place is fairly new so everything is clean and the wait staff is very attentive - let's hope these aspects withstand the test of time."}
{"text":"Forgot to post this from a few weeks ago, but hey, you can't forget great business, especially on the coat tails of bad service.

This red robin is awesome! Whatever management is doing, keep it up, the staff is great and really are sensitive to my allergies! If they make a mistake they are all over fixing, and quick!!! Thank you to the staff the San Tan Red Robin! You rock!"}
{"text":"Recommended if anyone likes a circus atmosphere. 
Loud, crowded and chaotic. Service is poor. Will never go back unless the line at McDonald's is too long."}
{"text":"We just walked out after waiting for a server who never came, after being seated at a booth with no light bulb overhead by an obnoxiously bossy \"manager\".  
I'm assuming the loud woman in street clothes was the manager, because she was rudely and loudly (presumably so others could hear how important she is) bossing a couple of workers around right in front of me, the customer, as I waited for someone to show me to a  table.  

We've eaten at this Red Robin several times, and the service is usually good, and we like the food. 

However, I'm HUGE on customer service. Poor service can and does make or break an establishment.  The lack of professionalism with with this woman handled my visit from the moment I walked in the door displays a complete lack of concern for the customer, her fellow employees, and Red Robin's name.  

The Peter Principle incarnate.  Disgusting.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I love Red Robins wide variety of burgers. Their whiskey river burger is my favorite. The sea food scatter is really good too however it's inconsistent sometime being over fried. Their ghost pepper sauce is really good plus endless fries will ensure you are full. The bar makes some good drinks & even have some nice unique ones however the drink menu is too limited on mixed drinks. Plus they had a limited time hurricane  drink along with the terminator promotion that was awesome last year but can't make independently for some reason which is disappointing as I really enjoyed it. Overall nice place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service was fine. My big problem was there was 3 tables that had food on them with no customers when we got there. By the time we ate and left, those 3 same tables were still not cleaned off. This was at 2-3 on a Friday afternoon. Not that busy at all."}
{"text":"This visit was just OK. Our waiter was pretty distracted and I sat for a while without a refill of my drink. They got rid of my favorite chicken sandwich, the Caprese :( but their new double cheeseburger on a subbed Ciabatta roll was tasty and about the same price as going to Carl's Junior. They were out of fries, so we waited a bit and were given a basket of fresh ones which were great. All in all about what is expected of this range of restaurant."}
{"text":"Classic family burger joint, JUST watch out they may sucker your kids into the games they CHARGE 1.29 bux each lmao suckers o well food is good service is fast people are kind FRIES are free refills  and the DRINK are cold"}
{"text":"Red robin has gone down hill. Feels like cost cutting has reduced quality. Fries are still very nice, but both veggy and beef patties have gone down. I am sad, as we typically enjoy RR, but feel the quality has gone down."}
{"text":"Ok today I was a little disappointed in the Service and food today. That's start with the sauces this being my second time here I've asked the waitress if I could try each of the sauces Because this was my daughters first time visiting I got a blank stare...... then I order chili nachos I some how could not find the cheese it was basically burnt off and told the waitress I did not want them it barely had chili on it with no cheese. The real reason I returned them because I asked the waitress were was the cheese she took a little finger and pointed in a dot of cheese on the corner of the plate.... that pretty much missed me off. The manager offered a new one I definitely did not want it after that. I'm pretty much done but I really just blamed the service this time. My first time visiting was awesome but this was far from it!"}
{"text":"Always have loved Red Robin. BUT, NOT THIS LOCATION! Visited this location around 7:30pm Sunday. We wanted to grab a good burger in a fun place where our children could enjoy and we celebrate our child's birthday. WRONG! Arrived at 7:30pm after calling ahead to check their wait time (was told no wait).  We were seated fairly quickly. Manager finally came and took drink order. A party of 9 was seated after us and they had a waiter WAY before we did. Finally the manager returned to check on us and he had to take our order. Although our order was not complicated, when it arrived (over 30 minutes LATER) it was wrong for 2 of the 5 of us.  We were left without drink refills for over 20 minutes. Waiter appeared at the end of our dinner. THEN, we decided to use the restrooms before leaving. OH BROTHER! It was like an ice skating rink trying to get myself and my children to the bathroom. My one daughter was on crutches and could not even get back there. The bathrooms were DISGUSTING. Only 1 stalk had toilet paper and 2 of the 5 (I think 5, or 6) had disgusting toilets.  I will NOT EVER go back to this one. We didn't even stay for a birthday dessert which was our original plan. Also, from my seat, I could see partially into the kitchen which was NASTY!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is always great at red robin but carina made our experience exceptional. She was probably the most attentive server I've ever had, was sarcastic and witty and just had fun with our table. Also a Chicago girl which is probably why she was so great! Thanks carina!"}
{"text":"This place seriously needs new management. The host struggled to seat 3 fanilies as soon as we walked in. Our waitress was pretty short and rude with us. It was not busy at all. We kept having to ask for fries, thought they were bottomless. She seemed annoyed every time we asked for more. She would refill our drinks and give us something different than what we wanted. A family next to us left as no one acknowledged them for 5 minutes after sitting down. All people want is good service, and this place needs some help especially cause it's in down town summerlin. It was dead in there I can see why."}
{"text":"Red Robin tonight 

Server: \"What temp would you like on your burger\"
Me: \"medium rare\"
Server: \"so a little pink?\"
Me: \"yes\"

Food delivered...WELL done. Why do you ask if you can't deliver?!?  Anywho, I talk to the manager face to face. She says \"oh, it's on a conveyer belt...we can't do pink\". To which I say \"why would the server offer a choice?\" Her response, \"if you order the angus burger we can do more pink\". 

Are the servers not trained on what burger I order whether is \"regular\" or \"angus\" patties??  Then she continues to say \"well if you tell your server, they can do it\". Mmmmmmmkay, rewind...\"I just told the server I wanted a little pink\". The employee next to the manager said \"we can't because of food borne illnesses\". I'm so confused now.

This will be our last attempt at Red Robin."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was very poor and odd at times.  This was our first visit to Red Robin.  Since we live less than a 1/2 mile away, this was a chance to try one of the newer food places in Downtown Summerlin.  You never get a second chance to make a first impression. 

We were semi-greeted when we walked in when an employee reached below the podium and got two sets of menus and finally gestured us to follow him.  I don't recall him saying a word to us.

Our server came to the table promptly and seeing his name tag, I said good afternoon *name*.  He responded with, \"Hi, I'm *name* and I'm going to be your server.  He was trained to introduce himself and give his name and by damn he was going to do it even though I had already spoken to him by name.  Odd.

He took our drink orders and soon brought two iced teas to the table.  We asked for time to study the menu more and when he came back we were ready to order.  He had also given me a card to text a word to a number to join Red Robin's reward program.  (He has seen me using my iPhone as I was checking into Yelp).

My wife ordered the soup and sandwich combo.  She got a cup of Red's Chili Chili and a BLTA croissant.  I ordered a cup of chicken tortilla soup and a Burnin' Love burger.  *name* asked me if I wanted my soup with my burger or before.  I answered before.  After not too long, I was surprised when two dinners were brought and I had received no soup.  Oh well, to err is human and I forget a lot, too.  No big deal.

My wife enjoyed her sandwich and really liked the chili.  My burger was topped with a grilled jalapeño that was very good and was a hot one.  There were \"jalapeño coins\" and the burger was on a jalapeño kaiser roll.  There was also chipotle aioli on the burger.  With all this talk about peppers and burnin' love, the only spicy thing was the actual grilled jalapeño.  The burger was good and I liked the fries.  Since they were bottomless steak fries, I wanted to get some more and to get an iced tea refill.  *name* never came back to see how things were.  I finally flagged him down and asked for more fries and iced tea.  Since there were people at three other tables, *name* could be forgiven for being overwhelmed with the work.

I finished my burger before my extra fries were brought and I had moved my plate to the center of the table to make room for the fries.  When they were brought, *name* removed the two plates from the center taking with him my fork I was going to use with my fries.  Instead, I used one of our large toothpicks to eat some fries until they cooled enough to pick up with my fingers and eat.

Before we were finished with our meal, *name* stopped by to see if we wanted to dessert.  I said back off in a nice manner.  When finished, *name* came back and we ordered the mountain high mudd pie.  The dessert was quite good but once again *name* had a way of irritating me.  *name* brought our check while we were enjoying dessert and rather than just folding the two sides closed and leaving it on the side of the table with the no hurry message, *name* insisted on leaving the check holder unfolded and almost forced it under my right elbow as I was eating dessert.  I picked it up, slapped the two sides together, and put it to my left out of the way.  Before we were finished, *name* came back to pick up the check.  I waved him off.  When we were finished, I looked at the check and sure enough, charged for soup I didn't get.  I pointed this out to *name* and told him he never brought the soup.  He just stared at the check and then walked away never saying sorry I forgot or anything else.  He brought the check back and he once again insisted on pushing the opened check holder under my right elbow.  *name* just doesn't learn.

I paid the check and we left.  My rating for Red Robin would have been a three.  The food is not bad and I enjoyed it.  Service is what brought it down.  *name* needs some retraining.  You've been open long enough to have this correct.  One thing, they won't have to worry about a free burger on my birthday.  I won't be redeeming that reward.  A second chance to make a first impression--of course not!  A second chance at having decent service along with decent food--maybe!"}
{"text":"When I think of Red Robin I typically think about a chain family restaurant... My hubby and I came Saturday for an early dinner and there was a HUGE line of people waiting to speak to the hostess. I was initially going to turn around and say \"let's go somewhere else\" but then I remembered, \"hey, we're adults! Bring on the bar!\" Now, I would estimate there were about 20 or so people crammed at the entrance. We went to the bar area and it was half empty . And no kids (sorry for those with kids, but if you want quick service as a group of adults, head to the bar area).

The service was pretty good. The bartender got us our beers quickly (not a large selection, but as my husband says you don't go to Red Robin to get wasted... And if you do jump off a cliff).

My food was like any other food at the chain. Old reliable. I ordered the teriyaki chicken burger with no mayo and spicy ketchup. It was delicious.  I'm not sure what my husband ordered but his burger came overlooked but he ate it anyway because we didn't want to wait. His plate was all kinds of chopped up. They probably should've tossed it, but instead they served it to him.

Will we come back? Sure, but only if we can sit at the bar with no wait. Until next time, ole reliable Red Robin."}
{"text":"What I don't understand is why we have all these burger stands out here. There's nothing wrong with this location. It's just that if I want a cheeseburger, I can just go to Burger King.."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends after a long hike. I brought my golden retriever along with me, so we ate out on the dog-friendly  patio. The food was good, our waitress was a bit inattentive, but regardless, will go back in the future."}
{"text":"Second round to visit the restaurant . We tried the bar this time . The bar tender previously welcomed us left ,  So Jordan took over . I didn't like my drink I ask for strawberry lemonade . I've had it before and it usually taste sweeter.  This one was very sour it appear that they had just added strawberries on top to add to the sweetness but the strawberries looked old and dull not fresh . I  ask the bar tender to add sweetness to it . Her reply was I don't understand what your saying . Lemonade is sour .
Seriously , anyways I ordered a Shirley  temple . It was still more soda than a combo  of cherry flavor. She didn't ask if the drink was better . I didn't say anything mind you the lemonade previously ordered sat in front of me the entire time I ate . Afterwards, she directed all her attention to my fiancé without looking at both of us .  How professional is that? . I was looking forward to enjoying a nice meal after a long weekend and craving a nice burger but I will considered going back. 
The food was good I don't think the burgers are worth $10 for a plate $1.50 xtra for onion rings that you only get a 4 count.

I'm always willing to treat myself when I feel it's worth the money .  Don't complain if you want great service at the bar .."}
{"text":"My first time here was with a group of coworkers to celebrate teacher appreciation. The host was great and our waitress great. The restaurant; however, wasn't very accommodating for teachers who weren't beef eaters. The teacher coupon was for tavern burgers; however, in our group were people like myself who do not eat red meat and others who don't eat meat at all. We were told that no substitutions could be made and if replacing the patty for turkey burger or black bean would result in paying full price. We understood and paid for our meals, but was very disappointed to learn had we gone to the RedRobin at NorthLake, our diet needs wouldn't have demanded full price as they were accommodating teachers who didn't eat beef no additional charge."}
{"text":"I like hot food - my favorite burger is the \"Burnin' Love\" burger. It packs a good kick!
The food has always been great, including the fries. 
Service has always been friendly and competent.
On a busy night, you might have to wait, and it takes longer for your order to be taken, but thats not out of the ordinary.
Parking is never a problem.
Its popular with kids, my niece loved going to a Red Robin before or after a movie. With that it mind, keep in mind that at times it can be loud.
One of my favorite places to grab a casual burger and cocktail."}
{"text":"I ordered To-Go tonight, the ladies who greeted me and took my order were very sweet. When I got home my family and I sat down to have dinner, and ended up throwing our food away. Everything was burnt, from the burgers to the black crisp rock hard fries!!! I can't imagine anyone cooking burnt food and thinking that's exactly what someone would like to eat. It was late when I finally arrived home, my son was exhausted and ended up going to bed without dinner. 'RED ROBIN...MMM!'"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch today. Although, we were the first ones there, the service was horrible. The root beer that I got had no carbonation, so I ordered an iced tea which was left empty for what seemed to be an eternity before I got refill. I ordered my burger medium rare and got well done, plus the hamburger was very dry and tasted like saw dust. the clam strip appetizer was a very small amount of clam strips plus they were coated in a heavy batter that tasted like flour. It should be Red Robin..YUK, not yum"}
{"text":"Very good! Despite the fact that it was packed when we arrived, we didn't have to wait very long to get a table. (We waited around 15 minutes, which isn't long for a place like this by my standards - especially on a Saturday evening). What I like about this place is all the decor. Plenty of things to look at while you're waiting. There's even framed pictures on the ceiling. Of course, the best part of the experience is the food! I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious. 

The only bad thing was that our server never asked if we wanted more fries. We actually forgot until we walked out of the restaurant asking each other, \"Hey, wait a minute, wasn't this place supposed to have 'bottomless fries'?\" So I guess it's kind of our fault and maybe they don't give you more fries unless you specifically ask for them.

One thing to keep in mind is that you might have to shout to everyone at the table (and to the servers) since it's pretty noisy in here. It's a very casual dining experience so it's what you would expect, but don't expect to be able to speak in a normal \"indoor voice\" here."}
{"text":"Red Robin...what can I say?  Despite being a chain, they really have some of the best burgers in town.  Our waitress from last week was so friendly.  She kept our drinks filled, brought us fries before our food was brought out, and had our check ready when asked.  They have new burgers that are less expensive and make your burger, your own.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Service (5/5) Our waitress was this really nice older lady with red/purple hair! She actually made the experience better. She was very talkative and gave some great suggestions. She was super honest which I appreciated because most waiters say they \"love\" everything on the menu. 

Food (4/5) The avocado burger was good but it wasn't the best burger I ever had. It had this hint of spice that I really liked. 

I would probably go back but I would get the hot wings instead."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been to red Robin at a different location but there's one thing they stay consistent with,,  their fries are tasteless and very soggy the most horrible fries I ever had in my entire life since I was 15"}
{"text":"Although having bad experiences already at this location, my daughter LOVES Red Robin and the distance to drive to the Henderson location from our house is not worth it. I received a message from management from my last visit (and Yelp post) requesting my info, but upon my response, never heard back.

Do not come here with any sort of expectation. This time, my fiance, daughter and I visited around 6pm on a weekday and were seated promptly. (Female, didn't get her name) server came by and was very friendly. Very personable. I noticed they didn't offer (at least on the menu) the kid's Mac and Cheese like they normally do. (My daughter always gets kid's Mac and Cheese with 2 sides of broccoli). On the regular menu they offered a \"grown up\" version,  like $13, which had extra stuff (truffle oil, bread crumbs, etc) which is great, except my daughter only eats plain Mac and Cheese. I asked if we could just get it plain, like they used to offer on the kid's menu, and she said it wouldn't be a problem. I ordered a burger, substituting a veggie patty, with extra pickle, and added a spicy aioli, of sorts. Fiancee ordered a burger, forget which one, but there were no issues with his order. 

I've been bartending (and have served) a long time, and while we were waiting for our meals, our server was quadruple sat... and sat and sat.. Of the tables she had that I COULD SEE, at one point, she had 11 tables. Needless to say we never received refills, my fiance and daughter's food came out a good 10 minutes before mine. My daughter's Mac and Cheese came out with all the \"adult\" added stuff on it and her broccoli was cold. When mine finally arrived, I had not one pickle, although I asked for extra, the aioli I requested was non-existent, and the veggie patty was so overcooked and hard I literally hit it on the plate and it didn't even fall apart. When we finally flagged someone down, my fiance was halfway through his meal and my daughter was hungry so she ate the cold broccoli, so I figured I'd deal with the disgusting patty and asked for the pickles and aioli. Aioli came, no pickle. I was done. Sent back the mac and cheese since it was going to take forever for another, and sent back my veggie burger. I was munching on the \"bottomless\" fries while waiting and was never offered a refill of, like, the 6 fries they actually give you. Our drinks were never refilled. Which 100% was NOT our server's fault because she was running around like crazy with all her other tables. She apologized profusely and said the manager was going to come talk to us (she offered, we didn't request), and about 15 minutes later she asked if he had come by (which he hadn't). She apologized and told us to hang on. Eventually, a man casually saunters over and said \"so, she didn't like the mac and cheese?\".. Seriously?? I showed him my disgusting veggie burger and explained the situation with the mac and cheese, and he acted like he was doing us a huge favor by taking the mac and cheese and veggie burger off the tab (which we never ate). Seriously, at least one of your servers is in the weeds with all these tables and you're not even on the floor to help out where you can?? She was giving poor service to everyone simply because you can't be in 5 places at one time. While we were waiting for him to come over we ordered a split milkshake (fully intending to pay) but he did comp that, also, without request. PLEASE get better people to run your store. Hats off to our server, who gracefully dealt with all of her tables and running around, and was still smiling. Wish I caught her name."}
{"text":"The caesar salad lacked parmesan cheese and the dressing tasted like ranch, maybe it was a ranch. Decent burger and onion rings. Crispy, juicy chicken tenders. Nothing out of the box though, a good ole burger restaurant. We would try it again if we run out of options."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are good(but isn't anything good when you're hungry). We've gone to this location a few times and it was pretty decent. The servers are always good each time we go. I like the whiskey chicken wraps the most!!  If you want a quick bite to eat, this is a good spot to go to. Just be cautious of the wait time."}
{"text":"Red Robin, 

Let me begin with an oh my. So the food isn't horrid but isn't great either.

We went as a semi large group 4 moms and 6 children after kiddos had a performance. We arrived at 11am and left around 2pm. This place is the absolute worst on timing.

We sat for a forty five minutes before our order was taken. The food took forever, we received things we didn't order like tortilla chips before receiving actual food we did order.

Kids Mac reorder took 40 minutes. 

I have no idea why we went to Red Robin every single time I have been there the food timing is horrible.

The server was never anywhere near our table and in the end split the checks incorrectly."}
{"text":"This is a follow up to a review I had about 2 years ago. I still have been going here about once every two-three months and service has been great. My previous review criticized how stingy Red Robin was with their bottomless fries. I suppose it really is just hit and miss with the server/waitress you get whether they're prompt giving you your fries after you order, but they have been great about bringing fries quickly for the most part. This keeps my wife and kid happy while we wait until our meal comes. 

I can't say I've had a bad experience at this location in the past 2 years I've been coming. Sometimes they seem a little understaffed or their server/waitress gets slammed in their section during a rush, but this has never affected my experience or my experience with my wife and kid. 

Food selection has diversified and my pescatarian wife has been pleased with their selection of the seafood. She enjoys the salmon entrée. 

I prefer the whiskey BBQ burger. It's always been my favorite and it comes out great every time. I do wish they added more BBQ sauce on the burger. 

My kid likes their mac and cheese and loves the mandarin oranges which they graciously refill for us. 

Red Robin also has a great rewards program that I utilize all the time (member since 2013). Free birthday burger (which you can claim at any time during the month, not just on your birthday), 10th burger/entrée is free, coupons in emails, etc. It's worth getting and the credit for your 10th free burger/entrée don't appear to expire. 

If you're looking for a good place to take your family, business colleagues, or just craving a burger, Red Robin has always been satisfying."}
{"text":"We don't come here a lot, but I feel like I can say we come here enough to know that our experience tonight was not up to par. 

First, we all know Red Robin has bottomless fries, as that is what they promote.  Second, we all know that literally almost every menu item comes with the option of bottomless fries.  

Which brings me to my point...

We sit down with our 3 kids and to keep them happy/entertained, we always order them the fries as we are going to order fries with our entree and kids meals.  Plus, nobody wants to listen to their kids complain about how they want fries, so too keep the kids happy (5 year old twins) we just get a basket of fries for them to start with; which has never been a problem in our umpteen visits to various locations in various cities.  However, Our server (skylar I think) decided to make this a big deal.  He said no the fries are made to order and that he cannot bring them out before the entree, but will see if there are any left over he can bring to the table.  Obviously, we are taken back as we are all going to be ordering fries with our meals, but whatever.  So we order our entrees and obviously we all order fries and then 5 or so minutes later the waiter brings a basket of fries and says hey, I was able to grab some old fries for you.  We thought to ourselves he was joking, but no, they were old fries.  It was literally a basket of old, soggy fries.  So we had to awkwardly call him back and say hey, since we have ordered our meals can we get some fresh fries so our kids don't eat old fries that feel like they have been sitting for awhile; I mean again, this place totes bottomless fries - I wouldn't expect you to have fries on tap, but you literally (yes I used this word again) brought our family a basket of old fries and even announced that these are old fries.

So time goes by and we notice that the place isn't that busy, but it is taking awhile for food to come and when we get it, it was fine, it was a burger and chicken sandwich from RR, won't win any awards, but wasn't bad either.  However, the kids Mac and cheese was barely room temp and when we got another one, the same thing, room temp.  I would have loved to talk to the manager, but he was hanging out by the expedite window, I think he came on the floor once during our visit, but ran no food, did not touch tables, nor engage with any guests.  Keep in mind we were one of 5 tables here.  Not sure if the food would've been warmer or come out quicker if he was helping expedite or run food, but I can tell you that the servers were doing everything themselves.

I know this is a lengthy review, but I am in the hospitality industry, specifically the f&b side and when we experience lack luster customer service and a management staff that doesn't really seem to care, it is frustrating to say the least.  Especially when the manager (middle aged man with a beard and a thermometer in his back pocket - which doesn't seem like he uses) doesn't engage with guest or do anything to better the guest experience.  

Highlight was the hostess, she was working Monday night 4/23.  Highly engaged and friendly with kids.

I keep going back to the Mac and cheese as it was lacking heat that it makes me wonder if the chef just said who cares, a kid is eating it.  Which is obviously a feeling that you don't as a parent.

Again, I know it's Red Robin and I am not expecting 5 star service but there are service standards that should be met and it was not this night.  It works from the top down and I can tell you the guy running the show tonight is not in the people business"}
{"text":"I lived off Red Robin fries in college, but \"bottomless\" is an understatement! Our waitress, once we hunted her down, would give us a basket of four--there were three of us!!!  

I loved my great balls of fire burger (it was slathered in fried jalapenos!) and the freckled lemonade is delish. There are better Red Robins: Kennewick, WA; San Diego, CA; and Riverside, CA. Abandon ship!"}
{"text":"Newly remodeled I love the burgers and if you join the club you get a free birthday burger. I'm eating mine today"}
{"text":"The drinks are excellent and are my favorite especially the pineapple chipotle margarita. The zucchini sticks are awesome also. They use whole real zucchini and quarter it. For me this does it all. The burgers are good satisfactory. But for me the drinks and zucchini are the best."}
{"text":"Food is good and prices are fair but the service is not the best to say the least. We have visited this location several times and it always seems as if no one knows what's going on or is in communication with each other. We waited a bit for someone to take our drink order, then we let him know we were ready but he disappeared for over 5 minutes. Finally he returned and we ordered, food came promptly. But that was it, we never saw him again. We had no water, my son didn't get a refill on his juice, no one offered us any more fries and only about 7 fries came with the burgers. We paid on the kiosk and we walked out. No one said a word, no thank you, no see you next time, now how was meal. Nothing. Waste of our $35."}
{"text":"This review is based on an experience I had on a Sunday evening, and I really hope they look into this and make the improvements necessary.

Décor: So, this is a Red Robin, and when you walk in they have the hostess station. They have  a full sports bar on the right, with general seating out on the main floor for both booth seating and table top. Décor is basic in nature, lots of stuff on the walls to keep your mind busy, and TV's to watch games.
Service: This is where things start to fall downhill. When we got seated, a group of 4, our server arrived. I won't use his name here, but it seemed like we were a nuisance to them. We ordered our drinks, and he asked if we wanted the table iPad things to play paid games and what not. We politely declined, but guess what, he still brought it. He wouldn't engage with us, and when we tried, it wasn't worth it. By the way, that little table top thing? It charged us 2 bucks for a \"entertainment fee\". I DIDN'T ASK FOR THAT THING. Apparently, we had to use it to pay the bill. I believe if the server wants a tip, they have to earn it, not just expect 20% regardless. There is more to this, but I don't want to be bashing, he could've had a bad day.

Food: Sigh, I know it's a chain burger place, but I had higher hopes. The burger was super sloppy, and the bun basically was so soggy that it turned into mush. We had 4 people order the fries, we only got 2 \"baskets\" of \"bottomless\" fries. It was smaller than a McDonalds small fries. We got charged for 2 upgrades to sweet potato fries, but only got 1. I mean, if this is supposed to be your \"thing\", then you need to follow through.

Overall: Sadly, I probably will not come back here ever again. I would rather go to In N Out or 5 Guys. If they can get better service, and the food quality can go up for the price they're trying to push for \"gourmet\" burgers, I will return. If you do decide to go, go during a slower time, maybe you'll get better service and food."}
{"text":"Everything is ok. Service is really good! Pretty pricy for the quality of food. Went there with friends, we had fun. I doubt will to go there again."}
{"text":"It's just OK for a burger place, pretty much right in the middle.

Mainly visited Red Robin since we hadn't been there in quite a while.  With so many burger joint options out there you can see why!  Red Robin does offer some tasty options though on their updated menu.

Wifey ordered their beast of a burger, the A.1. Peppercorn - gourmet burger topped with hardwood-smoked bacon, pepper-jack cheese, A.1. peppercorn spread, tomatoes, and crispy onion straws on an onion bun.  Sucker comes with a steak knife skewered right through it!  Wifey liked it, except she's still not a big onion fan, even if they come battered and fried.  I took a bite and thought it was good, the A.1. peppercorn spread having just enough bite & tang to go with the spicy pepper-jack cheese.  Onion straws gave it great texture, the tomato added some freshness, and the bacon was nice & salty.

I ordered the Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double - double patty combo of ghost pepper sauce, pepper-jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, and fried AND fresh sliced jalapenos!  The Tavern burgers are known as their 'value' menu burgers, they are a smaller patty on a smaller bun.  So this burger even though small, packed quite a bite!  The ghost pepper sauce had a real big kick, but not so hot that you wouldn't enjoy eating your burger.  The fried jalapenos were a nice contract in texture, and went along great with the fresh jalapenos.  Tis spicy!   

Of course at Red Robin the big appeal is their dang Bottomless Fries that come with each burger you order.  All you can eat baby!  Carbs be damned!  Now you actually have your choice of bottomless steak fries, sweet potato fries, or BROCCOLI.  Yep folks, broccoli.  And I, as your fearless Yelp Elite, went this route.  Wifey got steak fries so I could always share with her.  Me?  Wanted to cut back on them calories so I opted for the green.  But beware!  That broccoli serving comes in a measly bowl which may have only 5-6 florets of broccoli in them.  I literally ordered 6 servings of broccoli throughout the course of my burger.  SIX!  It was actually yummy, steamed, then with a sprinkle of Red Robin seasoning by yours truly.  I will say this, too much broccoli will make you burp (from both ends).

Overall not a bad meal, par for the course of a burger chain.  But Red Robin burgers are a bit pricey, wifey's set me back near $12, and mine was around $9.  Most times I would rather opt for a burger joint like In N Out or Five Guys.  Save money, save calories!  Okay, with Five Guys fries...maybe not.

MMMMM....beefy."}
{"text":"OK, so let's start this properly....Food is an amazing 5 stars.....if you can ever get it . Service in a word \"sucked\" and I never use that word about anyone because they are trying to earn a living. Our servers dinner was more important than anyone sitting at our table, as was evidenced by his sitting in the back eating while we all waited for drink refills. We couldn't  get refills on the bottomless fries because he was only \"allowed to bring out what the kitchen sent out\"! Manager was so unprofessional that his inventory seemed to be a priority instead of any complaints from customers. The Manager On Duty, was even overheard saying \"Get them their bills and get them the hell out of here\". Yelp doesn't allow less than 1 star, so my lone star goes to the bartender who, despite everything else, stayed positive and got my drinks out in a timely manner, considering her level of busyness in the bar area."}
{"text":"BRE is an awesome server!  She checks on you frequently, always has a smile can take a joke as easily as giving one and is just all around super friendly and outgoing!  If you ask her opinion about menu items, she will give you an honest answer.  If she don't like something, she will tell you so and give you a reason why!  Would definitely go back just because of her attitude and personality!!!!  Oh yeah, the food was amazing as well!!"}
{"text":"Red Robin is just that - A-OK.

It won't be the best burger you've had by any means but it'll definitely do the trick.  The service is overly friendly (reminiscent of a satirical movie - I can't remember if the server had pieces of flare).  Can't complain about that.

Hubs and I went with a bacony burger on special for $7.  He ordered more fries but never got them - good thing - 1 burger and fries is plenty.  Additional fries would have caused pain.  

It's relatively cheap and it will definitely fill your belly.  Great place for kids."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to meet for happy hour at this location tonight. We sat at the bar and I could immediately tell that our bartender was very busy. It took a few minutes for our drinks to come and it was very loud in the bar. I understand that when you work in a bar/restaurant that you are busy and not aware of patrons but many times the wait staff literally yelled across my friend and I. We decided to sit outside where it was quieter but once we got out there nobody ever checked on us. I would have purchased another drink but we were left out there a long time with no contact. It would have been very easy to just leave without paying but we came in and stood at the bar for our checks. I do think that the bartender would have been more attentive and friendly if she wasn't running like a maniac to keep up. It seems they need a other bartender. It was way too loud and annoying for a relaxing happy hour and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were perfect. Second time I've had this server. He was very unorganized and obviously was struggling with the few amount of tables he had. Both times I visited he was very impersonal and seemed like he was rushing you out since he was so flustered"}
{"text":"We are repeat customers here and every time we come we are happy with our service and meals.  The burgers are pretty godd as well as the fries and milkshakes."}
{"text":"This place was pretty packed on a friday night. We waited about 20 mins or so.  The server was pretty good, but swamped but made every effort to get us what we needed quickly :)  I didn't realize fries were basically unlimited when we ordered a basket of fries and he kept apologizing that he couldn't get us them, and I couldn't understand why until someone told me haha.

Any how the burger I got, the Big Melt Bacon burger, was pretty good but not as tender as I would have liked.  It was a bit overcooked but still decent.   The tower of onion rings is always great and we had strawberry lemonade that had a bunch of real strawberries in it!  It was soooo good with unlimited refills, they even made us a take home cup so we could have more on the way home!  Well worth the money to get that lemonade!

If you join the club, you get every 10th item for free which is nice."}
{"text":"Service was great and food was ok. DD n I sat in the back room and there were napkins , straw papers, and who knows what else all over the floor. Food took a while to come out but it was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Our family went for my husband's birthday.  Another year, another disappointment.  All our orders were missing something or cook incorrectly.  We had to ask for drink, French fry & broccoli refills....More than once.  The Mgr (assuming) did come over when she heard us asking for refills & apologized on behalf of the waitress as it was busy.  Unfortunately, this happens every time regardless is their business.  See you next yr for another update."}
{"text":"First time here, I'm having the whiskey BBQ burger and it's amazing!  I'm not very impressed with the service though. Our server Victor's customer service skills need some improvement. I was greeted with a very nonchalantly \"Hey buddy\" which in my opinion is not the best way to greet a customer. Didn't introduce himself, when I asked him a question after ordering our food and he kept walking away as he vaguely answered my question. I'm still here, almost done with my burger and hasn't been back once to check on my table. The guy definitely has potential to be a good server but didn't make a very good first impression. I'm definitely coming back and hopefully my next review will be 5 stars. Thanks!"}
{"text":"As a mom of two under ten years old, we've had our share of meals at Red Robins. I'm not much for a chain restaurant , but Red Robin has always been one place where I'm always happy to patronize in order to please my kids....Until I moved to Arizona last month, that is. Today we patronized  the RR at San Tan Village. The service was awful from the moment we walked in and the food left my six year old and I craving water to wash down the sour taste of expired bread well after we left. My hamburger bun was stale and crumbling. When my daughter whispered in my ear that the the pizza crust was \"too gross\", I was curious and took a bite. It was indeed disgusting and most likely made from spoiled dough. We won't be patronizing Red Robins anymore after this experience. There were many other little inconveniences and bad service that are far too vast to describe in a review so I'll spare you, but we were hungry, thirsty and quite angry when we left."}
{"text":"I have been to many other Red Robin locations before but they weren't as good as this one. The service I received was excellent. My drink was never empty and the food came out very quickly and it was delicious. I sat at a booth in the bar and the waitress was very polite and very professional."}
{"text":"Had to stop for a bite to eat on my 12 hour trip through the snowpocalypse from Mpls to Chicago. Not big on chain restaurants, but it's hard to complain about the burger, Bloody Mary, or bartender I had here. Wouldn't have guessed it was Demi's first day. Stop by here if you live in Madison and want a good burger and a tall beer, or are just passing by during a snow storm."}
{"text":"I went her last weekend and the food was great. I got the bacon cheese burger and it was cooked just the way I asked. The bottomless fries are also an added bonus, which are really good. The fries are also steak fries, nice and think. 
The only reason I didn't give this place 5 * is because the service was very slow. It took almost 45 minutes to get our food and the place wasn't even packed. Also the waitress didn't refill our drinks as much as she should've. We were always hunting her down. 
With that being said, I will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time dining there. Although, our waitress was nice, the facility and service was subpar. The floor was sticky, the table was wiped, but not dried; and the food portions were scarce. I'll continue to go to the Waterfront location."}
{"text":"One star is too much. The service was the absolute worst ever. After waiting an hour to sit, we waited another 10 minutes to place our drink order where I also asked for fries to feed my starving kids. While waiting another 10 minutes to receive our drinks, another family sat at the next booth and placed their drink order with the same waitress. We received our drinks. No fries. The other family received their drinks with a few trays of fries. Then after waiting another 10 minutes with no fries, and now empty cups on the edge of our table, we watched as our waitress take other people's orders. She finally came to our table without any fries and took my empty glass. We waited another 10 minutes and finally just walked out and went to McDonald's. This is by far the worst service ever. Understaffed, poorly trained, unorganized, and ridiculous. It baffles me how busy this place is. The next time my family wants restaurant quality burgers, we're going back to FUDDRUCKERS!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so the bottomless steak fries are a pretty great perk, but other than that it just seemed like your average restaurant. Nothing really amazing about it. 

The first time I ate at a Red Robin was in Florida and there wasn't anything really memorable about it, so I wasn't expecting much of this visit. 

The hostess was emotionless and couldn't seem to get the number in our party right...we had to switch tables. Our server, luckily, was very cheerful. 

My salad could have used more walnuts and the kids meals my niece and nephew got seemed a little dry. I'm not sure what my brother and his fiance thought of their burgers. 

Prices are good so it's a good place to go if you have a family. I had fun playing the activities on the kids menu with my niece and nephew."}
{"text":"We chose to be seated other side which is over 21 years old .. Because other side was too many ppl and kids ... I think they were having birthday party so we chose 21 years old side ! Services was good,inside of restaurant was clean we shared all food with my husband so they made bugger cut half for us !"}
{"text":"Went with family, 4 of us total.

Food was decent, but server (Keitumetse) was not very attentive at all.


She disappeared after taking order, do we didn't get any fries to munch on while waiting for food or refills, my wife had to ask another server to get a refill. Our server brought them, then disappeared again. Food was brought by others and we had to ask for silverware since that was never brought.

The restaurant did not appear to be busy, so missing server was inexcusable."}
{"text":"If I wanted an overdone burger on a soggy grocery store bun topped with canned mushrooms, I'd eat at home. Liked the mint brownie shake, but the portion size was small for the price. Loved the sweet potato fries. But the burger is supposed to be \"gourmet\" and totally wasn't. $38 for two sub par burgers, a shake, and an iced tea is way too much, even with bottomless sides."}
{"text":"I can't.... sorry, I guess my taste has been spoiled by great burger joints like BRGR & Burghatoy. I can't handle bottomless fries that are pretty bad & being served food in a red basket and a burger wearing a diaper. 

What does Red Robin have going for it? Chunky strawberry lemon aid."}
{"text":"Normally, when I'm looking for a burger or in my case a veggie burger or portobello mushroom cap I'll hit up BRGR or Burgatory. Sometime though if at the waterfront I'll stop at Red Robin, mainly for the freckled lemon aid. 

On a recent visit I decided to try their veggie burger, I ordered it with lettuce, onion and pickles. I had a hard time deciding if this was a Morning Star Farms offering or house made. If it was a frozen patty, shame on them. True burger joints need to show the vegans and vegetarians that Red Robin wants their business and should make an in house patty. The waiter could not answer my question regarding to my inquiring if their meatless burger was house made or frozen. It wasn't bad though. 

In my pre- vegan days I loved the monster burger and endless fries. 

For a chain Red Robin isn't bad, I still frequent the indie places just for the fact they're local owners and they have a better product."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely horrible although the food itself was good. We never saw our staff and had to keep asking for the little things like sauce and napkins. Never going back to this location again."}
{"text":"I love Red Robin.

Its this location that has kind of let me down.

I have had ok service in the past and that is why this is a two star review instead of a one star review.

My fiance and I came here the other day before seeing Jurassic World down the street. He ordered a Hawaiian Burger and I ordered a Chicken Ceasar wrap like always.

Everything is going great until our food comes out and there is no dressing in my wrap. (Insert sad face) just a dry bed of lettuce, tomato, and a few pieces of chicken. I let our server know and he apologized and had them make a new one. The only problem is now my fiance has his food and his is getting cold because he of course doesnt want to be rude and eat while im waiting for mine so now were both in a lose lose situation.

The manager brought out my food and was very nice and i really do appriciate that, (Another reason this is a two star review and not less)

So I start to eat my wrap and the first half I ate was almost completely empty. Like one tiny square of chicken and a little bit of lettuce. It might as well of been an empty tortilla with dressing in it. 

The worst part for me was when I bit into my second half and almost broke a tooth an a huge hard chunck of what I can only guess to be bone or cartilidge... 

That honestly ruined the entire meal for me. 

For ever."}
{"text":"$16.00 for an ok Burger & Fries, Coke tax and tip - nuff said"}
{"text":"There is a lot I can say about todays lunch at Red Robin.

Service across the bar was just awful, I never did get a drink.

After that at the table my beer took 30 minutes.

If you read my reviews you would know service is very important to me. today what I wanted to happen didn't. It certainly wont be rushing back to RR anytime soon.

20 minutes after an attempt to serve us another tables food our order arrived. We had no napkins and no utensils, most drinks empty and a waiter that just wanted to go home.

Our second server, after the first actually left, was way better, cheerful and efficient. She wrapped up our last 20 minutes the way I imagine the home office thought our entire visit should have been.

My burger was good, but the fries were soft, the beer was tall and cold, and the prices were fair. All 3 stars are for that and KC for picking up the slack.

Red Robin.... hmnnn"}
{"text":"Unreal. This place is still an absolute mess! Literally at every turn there's an issue. If you can deal with all that the food is usually pretty great. Watch your check though they over charged us for a shake."}
{"text":"The workers, servers, hostess stand, and gm, and managers are such a well rounded genuine staff!! Besides the food being delicious as always I really like when the staff goes above and beyond to make you feel welcomed. I love this location and I will be coming back! One of the best red robin locations around"}
{"text":"Went to this location yesterday. It was pretty slow in terms of business but had a good experience. We sat in the bar and the bartender was really nice. He was funny and made our experience quite pleasant. The host at the front was friendly, too. The food is great and priced perfectly. We didn't wait more than 15 minutes for our food to be made and it came out hot and fresh, and of course it was delicious. My favorite appetizer is the towering onion rings! We also enjoyed the happy hour. I'd recommend this Red Robin! There wasn't anything wrong with our experience, but it wasn't outstanding, either."}
{"text":"Every time, I go to Traders joes or T mobile and I want to eat something,  I go to Red Robin, I do not frequent chain restaurant usually, but like usual , I can have my special request of a vegi burger wrap in lettuce and some French fries with camp sauce. The service is consistent and a special thank you to my server today Britni who provide me with an excellent service even better than most of fine dining.  Britni,please stay in the hospitality  industry. We need people like you."}

{"text":"I had lunch here last week with 3 coworkers. If I had dined alone, I would be giving Red Robin 4, perhaps even 5 stars, as my experience was great. Sadly two of the three people I was with had issues with their food though, so I am giving this Red Robin experience a 3.

We started out lunch with a basket of fries. Red Robin has delicious steak cut fries which they will give you unlimited refills on. It's pretty much impossible to leave Red Robin hungry because you can always fill up on the tasty fries. 

I had the soup and sandwich combo which was a BLTA sandwich and a bowl of clam chowder. One of my coworkers ordered a turkey burger. Another ordered the crispy chicken tender salad, and the third ordered red's rice bowl. 

My order came out fine, as did the crispy chicken tender salad. (The salad looked amazing, I will probably order it the next time I go) The turkey burger came out as directed but it was under cooked. The person that ordered the rice bowl ended up with a chicken salad. 

Our server did a good job of rectifying our issues, but I still have to base my review on everything that happened. I have had many good experiences with other Red Robin locations over the years, because of that and the fact that our server fixed our problems I will certainly go back and give this location another try in the future."}
{"text":"Red Robin, why you slipping? I have had some acceptable experiences here, but after my last visit I am in no hurry to come back. 

I recently had lunch here on a weekday with 2 coworkers. We were seated promptly in the bar area with no wait but service was quite slow from that point on. 

It took our waitress about 10 minutes to come to the table to take our drink order. We have had her as our waitress in the past and she's typically on point, and we could see her interacting with other customers so I believe the delay was due to a staffing issue. 

When she did make it over to our table, she not only knew what each of my coworkers wanted to drink, she also knew we were going to want a basket of bottomless fries to start out. She stated she'd put that order in right away. 

A few minutes later, two of the three iced teas we ordered came out. 
Then the third.
Then our food. Still no fries. Well, I had the fries that came with my burger, but the fries that were meant to be an appetizer were MIA. 

Our waitress apologized and said her manager would be by the table.
Then we get the fries, but the basket was only half full. 

The manager did come by, but wasn't very apologetic and didn't really do anything to rectify the issue. At a minimum, the fries ordered as an appetizer should have been removed from the bill. 

The burger I had was actually really good, but the kitchen and management are not up to par, a good server can only do so much. I'm still debating if I will bother going back. 

Yelp Reviews 2018 29/100"}
{"text":"First of all, if you are undecided where to eat.  Drive down S. Eastern and you can't go wrong.  Restuarants on both sides from FF to sit down.  Because of the wide selection, this Red Robin is sometimes my pick when I'm in the area and am hungry. Doesn't get too busy and service is always good here.  Their burgers are good, juicy, and the thing that sets any burger here apart is based on what you put on it.  I forget all the different types of burgers you can get, but they make pretty much everything.  The turkey burger is also good.  I tried the Oktoberfest Burger and wasn't too impressed.  I should have stuck to what I usually get, which is their Tavern Double.  So good.  

Other Try's:
-Cod Sandwich.  Not bad, but Bachi's ruined it for them.  Haven't found anyone that has a better cod sandwhich than Bachi Burger.
-Patty Melt:  Okay, but small. You will wish you got a burger. 

Now my favorite, their fries.  I prefer steak fries over regular fries, season fries, garlic fries, and onion rings.  Bottomless steak fries here.  My only issue is that they give you about 10 pieces.  It's bottomless, but c'mon. Hook it up the first time so I don't have to keep on asking for more."}
{"text":"My friends and I came in for my partners birthday on Friday and we had an amazing experience! I got the BBQ onion chicken sandwich + bacon and it was the bomb.com! My partner got a plain burger and she was super happy about it. All of our friends enjoyed themselves, it was fun going before the movies to just smash on unlimited fries :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"Had my usual chicken tender salad. It was good as always but this time they substitute it with the chicken from the sand which in stead. Was very tasty. The manager also came to inform us that the chicken was substitute and not normally served this way. I though it tasted really good. I definitely recommend it if you ever try the crispy chicken salad."}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is offensive; this is my second awful experience at this location making it a pattern and not just a coincidence. My suggestion would be to not even attempt to ask a question or assume you can have an average conversation with any of the ignorant individuals that work here.  When trying to call in an order to go you get conflicting information from their call center to the hosts, who in particular take zero responsibility for anything they say and immediately defend themselves without even listening to what the customer is saying, \"Well it wasn't me that you talked to so I don't know what to tell you,\" is just one example of a response they go to.  Then when picking up your order to go you can count on hearing the employees complain about management and their terrible call center; at least they know it's awful. The person this time answering the phone was Michael who has no idea how to treat anyone with an ounce of respect and just likes to express his two year's experience at Red Robin in a condescending tone which apparently makes him better than everyone else, even though he is contradicting everything the previously employee, Jacob, had just told you 30 minutes prior. Congratulations Michael, not only are you an idiot, you're an asshole. Way to lose customers before they even arrive."}

{"text":"Say what you want about Red Robin, but it will always be my favorite burger. Besides the burger, RR also makes a great chicken caesar wrap, chicken burger, fish & chips, chicken tenders, and of course, the BEST fries!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one to write.  

Time frame: 20 minutes to be greeted by staff after getting a table, 30 minutes until drinks, 65 minutes until burgers arrived.  Ugh, terrible.

Staffing: Nothing short of maximum effort on their part.  Visibly  sweating, moving nonstop, amazingly positive attitude for the unending river of shit customers were giving them.

Food: Not too shabby.  On par with other Red Robins we have been to. 

What happened today was more than likely a perfect storm.  Holiday weekend, 12:30 lunch rush, and no kidding at least 8 groups of families with showed up in a 5 minutes span to be seated.   Loud, baby strollers everywhere, parents obviously fried from dragging their screaming kids from store to store all morning; this was a tough day for the staff. 

So

Food: 3.5 stars.  It's burgers and fries. 
Atmosphere: 0 stars due to the noise, chaos, ( but a solid 4 for the actual place; surprisingly clean)
Staff: 10 stars.  I would have quit on the spot. Strong work gang.

Are we going back.....   eh, not sure."}

{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend yesterday and I loved it. I always love their food- whoever cooked the food for Tuesday, it was amazing! Our server was also fantastic! She came back to check in with us every 5 minutes or so, just like how it should be! Overall, it was a great date night with fantastic service :)"}
{"text":"We love this place for several reason but the number one reason we live it is because the are amazing with our family!
Our family is gluten free and our oldest daughter has autism. They are always accommodating with there food selections and go out of their way to provide us information and food that is gluten free.
BUT the even better part is that they treat my daughter with complete respect and just like a regular kid.
This autism mom couldn't be happier"}
{"text":"Saturday night.  Kids with us.  Was told a 10 minute wait that turned into 20.  Was seated in back half next to 5 tables that were used to hold dirty plates.  Poor timing of food service.  They forgot my son's \"bottomless\" order of fries...bottomless my a$&!  Then we were told to use the wireless ziosk to order a beer but the server was able to bring my Diet Coke refill?!?  Bad experience, Red Robin!  Get it together!"}
{"text":"my favorite informal place to go with the family or friends. good food good service."}
{"text":"Wow, talk about downhill. We went to this location years ago and it was nice.  Decided to try it 11/14/ 2017. Huge disappointment. Arrived at 4:15 to 4:30 and found the parking lot and restaurant almost empty. Clue #1. We were seated at a table. Most tables, chairs and the floor were covered with old food crumbs, etc. we were the only ones in the section until two others sat down with the purse \"service dog\" which was now on the table. There seemed to be enough staff to clean but that wasn't happening. Maybe they were waiting til closing time. The food, just average. Done with Red Robin, well at least this one. There are better restaurants out there who would love more business."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. We had one little hiccup where our appetizer was forgotten but our server was attentive and worked hard to make up for it. The burgers were yummy tho! Looking forward to going back and eating here again!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  Great burgers and the bottomless fries are really good but the service was a little slow. We waited for a while for refills on fries and drinks. The waiters are really nice but they had big parties all the time and it took a while for them to get to us."}
{"text":"Solid.  In and out in 45 minutes with a full stomach and not too much damage to the wallet.  

Nice staff and good service."}
{"text":"At one time this was a great place for lunch, but the restaurant is falling apart. Today we were sat at a wobbly table against a divider in the floor that kept coming up. Under the divider was all sorts of wet crap. It was gross. Someone is going to trip and get hurt, I would be surprised if someone hasn't already."}
{"text":"I ordered the Royal and my Daughter ordered a Tavern Burger, everything tasted pretty good, Fries were lukewarm, but the waiter was awful, because he wasn't there. My 1 year old granddaughter dropped the napkins, We couldn't find anyone to give us anymore. Finally the waiter showed back up, didn't even stop, he literally walked slowly past us and asked if there was anything. We told him more napkins... Showed up 10-15 mins later. The Ketchup bottle was empty. Once again, no one to get another. Luckily the people next to us gave us theirs. I never received another refill for my soda, my daughter wanted more fries... no luck there. When we finished we stacked up the plates on the corner of the table. We waited a while... Finally just paid the bill on the little kiosk and left... I'll be going to Gordon Biersch from now on..."}
{"text":"Always love coming here..such great food!
I wanted to recognize Myana for her extra friendly service. My boyfriend & I were @ the restaurant on 06/07 & Myana answered every single question I had & recommended to me one of my new favorite dishes. I just wanted to make sure her enthusiastic & friendly hard work did not go unrecognized!"}
{"text":"Good food. Horrible service. We were there for 90 minutes because that was how long it took from being seated to get our food and drinks. Our waitress was pretty much non-existent so I had to flag down another server (something I hate doing because it feels so rude) to ask for a refill for my daughter. Someone else dropped off our food and didn't even give us the chance to tell him that something was missing from our order so we had to wait forever for that as well. Once we received it, our waitress had an attitude and seemed rushed (which was weird because it wasn't even that busy). Both my husband and I have worked food service so I'd like to think we aren't difficult customers because we know what it's like but this was a pretty creepy experience."}
{"text":"The burgers are the best! I had the Royal Red Robin and it was perfectly prepared. I also had the salted caramel shake and it was perfecr! Jason, the server, was friendly and had a great personality, he was cracking jokes everytime he walked by. He was very attentive. Make sure to try the DGB burger!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe how rude the hostess was today at lunch time. She threw the menus on the table and never said a word to us except \"how many\". Honestly the worst hostess experience I have ever seen at a restaurant. 

Then my boyfriend gets his burger and their are 4 total fries. Talk about skimpy. Yes I realize you can order more, I just didn't understand why they gave us so little from the start. 

Then when he had ordered the burger, the waitress asked pink or no pink and he said no pink, guess what it was definitely medium rare. 

Finally, our waitress went to fill up my raspberry iced tea and came back with regular iced tea. Which is annoying because the raspberry was more expensive than the tea. 

Giving them two stars because of the quality of my salad."}
{"text":"If you want a good burger and some great steak fries, this is the place to go.  Be prepared to pay out a small fortune but it sure beats most of the competition.
I generally have a good experience everytime I go and at every one I have been too."}
{"text":"Staff very friendly, prime chophouse burger very good as was the French dip , only problem they forgot to give the $10 bonus when we ordered $50 card, otherwise very good."}
{"text":"Everyone is always so nice and the restaurant is always very clean! The food stays consistent and that's always most important to me when choosing where to eat! The GM is personable and quick to meet the customer's needs! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Not the most amazing place, but for the price it's a great value.  They have great milkshakes and the chicken fingers are really good."}
{"text":"This place has happy hour prices all day! Nuff said? Okay you can seriously grab a 16 oz domestic draft for only 3 bucks... that isn't bad at all. This location has pretty good service. For instance, me and my girl ordered some guac and chips. We ran out of chips and asked for more to finish up the guar. It was no problem... our server brought us more.  

Yes, I know they were just chips.... but some places are pretty anal about stuff like that. Can you believe it?

OHH .. this guiness shake is bombbbb!!!! sweet and rough"}
{"text":"Service at this location is terrible. They got my order wrong for starters. My child spilled water on the table and our waitress walked by us twice and she seen us struggling to get it cleaned up. She gave me a rag to clean up myself. The French fries did not come out with the wrong burger I was serves yet she brought out a few other tables with there complete order with fries. I called her over and said we see everyone with French fries but I don't have mines? She made excuses and blamed it on the cooks."}
{"text":"Best gluten free buns ever. Honestly, if you're cutting it out for health reasons or just trying to eat well, check out the gluten free buns! They even do the fries in a separate fryer, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"This is so bad. Our waiter took a good 10 minutes to wait on us and another 15 minutes to serve the food. It arrived cold. He finally redid our endless fries after the meal was done. He was the bar tender too.
His name is Rocky."}
{"text":"The hostess was rude and \"having a bad day\" was written all over her face when we walked in. She tried sitting us at a table by yhe front door and didnt ask if we wanted a table or booth. We asked her for a booth and she rolled her eyes and said follow me. Clearly more annoyed. We complained about her to the manager. The manager apologized and walked away. Dissappointed that after her hostess mistreated us we got no discount at all for it. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"The rating would be zero stars if I could. The appetizer and main course were ordered at the same time. The appetizer came out cold and the main course was even colder. The restaurant was not very clean and the server was very slow and took along time coming back around to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"I said I would've given it four stars last year if not for the fries. Well, I figured out a fix for the fries.

Went back to Red Robin for my birthday again. As I said before, sign up for their rewards program (Red Robin Royalty) and they'll load a free burger onto your account annually during your birth month. You'll hardly have to buy your own food if you find enough places like this.

Anyway, the fries thing. I asked for them to cook 'em longer on both occasions. It didn't work perfectly the first time (only a little better than the standard cook), but the bottomless steak fries definitely came out golden brown with mostly crunchy potato pieces on the second attempt. This batch was almost everything you want from fries. They're underseasoned, but just add sufficient amounts of ketchup and the Red Robin Seasoning (salt, pepper, paprika, other various spices) and you'll be fine. Or you can do with the salt and pepper grinders if that's your thing.

(UPDATE 11/7/17: You can just say \"extra crispy\" to order the fries this way. I also suggest checking inside the menu for 5 complimentary sauces which you can request on the side. The \"Secret Tavern\" sauce is that creamy light-orange stuff that you'll often find everywhere by different names.)

The burger was good too. This year, I went for the Whiskey River BBQ Burger (normally $10.69) with ciabatta. I listened more closely this year and realized that the server told me that my options were \"no pink\" or \"a little pink.\" This gave me more realistic expectations for the meat color, and I'd say that the patty was indeed \"a little\" pink. The ciabatta was a nice, sturdy alternative to the standard bun. The burger overall was a sweet and savory treat with the namesake BBQ sauce, crispy onion straws, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo. I might consider asking for it again without mayo since that dulled the BBQ sauce's flavor a bit.

Service felt a bit sluggish with my order taking longer to start than I thought it should've, compounded by server confusion. The host didn't explain upon seating me at the bar (not my request) that I'd be ordering with the bartender-esque server, and that server didn't really introduce herself and/or explain that she'd be taking my order. I guess it wasn't so bad because the place was pretty packed at about an hour past peak lunch.

After I finally got in the order, things ran smoothly enough. Well, aside from the air vent expelling cold air directly onto me, but I was fine in my jacket. Your mileage may vary.

As I said before, I'll be back here or at another Red Robin every year. It's not a premium burger, but it's solid casual dining and it's fantastic when it's free.

(UPDATE 12/10/15: fried mushroom app is decent, fried mozzarella stick app is very average, and #NameThatChicken burger might not even be as good as some of McDonald's \"premium\" chicken sandwiches. But at least the burger was free to people with names similar to Saint Nick or Kris Kringle. Hooray, promos!)"}
{"text":"Service at this location is horrible, for the second time in a row we had to wait over five minutes to get service, and this time our server was quick with an excuse. We ended up leaving and I will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"After 5 PM, the adult management apparently takes off work. They're after plan to be served by teenage girls... Who have nothing better to do than chew gum."}
{"text":"Went there today at 6 PM. Large crowd.  Bar was EMPTY.  Told hostess we would do bar, she said 45 minute wait. I said bar was empty, she did mot care.  Said there was still a 45 minute wait. Terrible customer service., so we went to Chiki's for drinks."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had at a Red Robin. Friday night 8:45 pm the restaurant is not quite 1/2 full. On the way to our table the hostess asks if we're having a party and I informed her yes, it's my daughters birthday. We are seated and everything starts off as usual. We get a stack of onion rings which come out fairly quickly and we are left with no utensils or napkins. It takes 5 minutes to get anyone's attention regarding the napkins. After 10 minutes go by the 4 tables in front of us 2 tables behind us and 8 tables to our right are emptied. We set our empty glasses on the end of the table as 3 employees walk by without noticing.  I finally flag one over and ask for refills of the drinks and of my fries. 10 minutes go by until we get our drinks refilled. 10 more minutes and the waitress comes by and says my fries have been ordered. 15 minutes after that I flag her down to ask for the check. Still no fries after 35 minutes waiting for them in a restaurant that is 3/5s empty. There's no machine at our table and the waitress is nowhere to be found so we pack up and walk to the front where I send my family to the car and try to find someone to pay my bill. No one ever acknowledged the Birthday Girl nor was my bottomless basket of fries ever refilled. To be clear - I really enjoy RR and have never had but a great experience over many many years and the food was delicious but I don't believe I will be returning to that particular Red Robin."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening with my brother, it was quite busy but expected since it was a Friday. The wait was 30 minutes which seemed to pass by quickly. My sever was Kory, she saw us within 5 minutes of being seated. She got our order for drinks and came back and asked if we had any questions about the menu. It was really busy this night we came, so when she came back with drinks we decided to order knowing it would take a minute for our food to arrive. Although the restaurant being busy she made a point to come see us and see if we could use a refill on our drinks and told us our food should be out shortly. There was a Dodger game going on so we were occupied for the mean time waiting on our food. Our food didn't take too long and Kory came to check on us here and there to see if we needed anything. The food was great, you can never go wrong with a burger here and need to mention the bottomless fries. What made the experience great was having excellent service from our server Kory! She made an effort to come check on us even though she had a load of other guest to help."}
{"text":"I love this place, again I drive 1.5 hours to come eat here. I have a location 20 mins closer to me and won't eat there. I love the food here, always fresh. Never had a problem at all at this location. Everyone is really friendly :-)"}
{"text":"When we entered we were not greeted as the hostess was busy arranging her wait staff for the evening.  A very nice man then sat us and was surprised that we had not even been acknowledged yet.  Our server was friendly and quick.   Two kids pizzas were ordered.  When delivers the presentation was nice but the pizza was hanging over the plate and touching the serving tray and table.  A \"mighty\" caeser salad was ordered....it was romaine lettuce a tiny bit of chicken, Parmesan from a pizza shaker and the bowl was half full.   No garlic bread was delivered either.

Finally, if someone orders a water don't place a random lemon in it...try asking or put it on the side!"}
{"text":"So my family went here Sunday and had the worst meal. Service was terrible and they were in over their heads. Took forever to get cold food. Sent most of it back and some in our group were done eating before others got their food. Manager did not seem to care."}
{"text":"This place is the worst not just the South hills one the Robinson is just as bad the service is extremely bad it is so slow at both allow your self hours !!! Don't go if your in a rush the food is not that good either!"}
{"text":"I don't usually like to give a bad review, but hopefully the company will maybe see this and do something.  Food is usually very good.  The last few times we've been, the service has absolutely sucked!  The servers they we got have been lazy and rude. One of my friends asked what kind of dressing was on her chicken salad and said it didn't taste like what she had ordered... His response, \"well, that's what you ordered, isn't it\" and then walked away.  The manager didn't seem to care either.  None of my friends want to go back anymore."}
{"text":"Great location, the staff is super friendly and quick.  We were greeted, seated and introduced (to our server) within 3 minutes, and the place was packed.  It was nice to be around staff that were happy to be at work.  The smiles were definitely infectious.

We started with their zucchini and mushroom app.  DELICIOUS.  These are definitely not frozen.  The zucchini was crunchy and fresh and the mushrooms were the best fried I have ever had.  My daughter had the strawberry lemonade (bottomless) and I had their ice tea.  Both were very flavorful and fresh.  Daughter had a chicken salad (which she demolished) and I ordered the All American Patty Melt.  I loved that they even asked how I wanted my burger cooked.  The Melt was on point with this fabulous marbled rye bread.  It was very generous and I had to take half of it home.

For you french fry junkies, they have great steak fries and on most of the meals the fries are bottomless as well.  You definitely get your monies worth at the Red Robin."}
{"text":"I try not to eat at chains when I'm traveling, but since I have never eaten here I decided to give it a go. I had a burger with to-die-for fries. The server was very friendly and attentive, the food good and the atmosphere pleasant."}
{"text":"Great time for a quick bite before heading off to a Mothers Day matinee. Burgers and bottomless fries"}
{"text":"Burgers. If you follow me, you know I love them. You also know that I rarely leave a one star review. 

Today's trip to Red Robin was frustrating. I had Mom and Dad with me today, out for a late valentines date. 

We were greeting only after my dad said hello to the Hostess. She was too busy blowing up balloons to say hello. 

Our server was quickly at our table, and slow to bring the wrong drinks. My dads a diabetic, and she brought him sweetened peach tea, after he asked multiple times if it was unsweetened. Whatever. She eventually got it right. 

She takes our order from memory. (She also forgot to introduce herself, so she's fortunate that her name isn't smeared throughout this review.) I HATE when servers do that. You're not gonna remember everything. Our food comes out and dads fries are on moms plate, mom doesn't have her spicy sauce on the side, and my burger that was supposed to be pink, is well done. There's also only five fries on my plate. So, I placed a reorder. 

Ten minutes later, no fries. Dads ready for more, too. She's over at the bar, on her phone. Sorry, I use my phone a lot, but never in front of the people I work with, or does it deter me from doing my job. This girl was Candy Crushing something serious when I walked over to the bar, and asked about the fries. \"Oh, I didn't know you wanted more!\", was her response. Again, whatever. 

The manager comes out with the fries in what seems like a millisecond. He tosses them on the table, ignores our empty drinks and goes away with no interaction. 

I always wonder why you wait for an eternity here. They're never busy. Their parking lot is basically just overflow for Mitchell's. 

I'll say it a third time, as never go back to homestead, whatever. 

Happy Eating, Just not here!"}
{"text":"Picked up lunch for my dad and I on a Monday just after noon and the restaurant was not busy. We always enjoy the food which is why the 3 stars. I knocked off 2 stars for incidentals. Woman who took my to go order at the bar didn't offer me even a glass of water while I waited. As I sat there observing I believe she was even a manager. Another woman handed me my check. Still no drink offer. I usually always tip on a to go order. Not this time. Also the bar top was dirty. Not just crumbs but also some solidified liquid stuff. Finally I saw a server use a drinking glass to get ice out of the ice bin multiple times. That is such a huge no no in the restaurant biz. As much as I like RR I'm not sure I will be back anytime soon. There are plenty of great burger places out there with better customer service, friendlier staff, and better standards."}
{"text":"Kuddos to the manager!  My husbands egg on his burger was ordered over medium and came out practically scrambled.  The waitress quickly took it back and the manager came out quickly to apologize.  She followed up at the table a little later as well.  Great job, great service!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the nicer Red Robin restaurant locations I've been too.  The staff was friendly and courteous.  The food was alright.  The dining experience wasn't awful but it certainly didn't blow my socks off.  I usually have a lot more to say in my reviews but I guess my lunch here wasn't that memorable.  Overall, I would say my experience here was okay.  I would give this place 2.5 stars if I could.   

We ordered:
-Fiery Ghost Tavern Double ($8.49) - my mom ordered this, she really enjoyed her burger but she thought it would have been a little bit spicier because of the jalapenos on her burger, she also noticed her burger only came with fresh jalapenos even though it was supposed to come with both fresh and fried jalapenos
-The Southern Charm Burger ($13.99) - served with bacon on a ciabatta bun, I thought this was just okay, also ordered this to be medium rare but it came out more on the well done side, the ciabatta bun was a little on the soggy side, I opted for the onion rings instead of the fries and the onion ring breading would just fall off every time I would try to eat/bite it. A little overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"The waiter was very nice but I'm so disappointed in the service. We waited 20 minutes just for them to take our drink order. Never coming again."}
{"text":"Good fortune in coming across Red Robin. We haven't been to one since we left CA 4 years ago. We loved our meal. I tried the veggie burger and it was fantastic. I love their potatoes also.

Some background, I am highly prone to get gout. I can only eat veggie or chicken. Red Robin's menu has a great selection of chicken burgers and I mentioned their veggie burger so I am in heaven."}
{"text":"Is good hamburger!! But my low point is for the service. We wait during 10 minutes or more and never receive any waitress. We complaint with the manager a she was very good cuatomer service!!"}
{"text":"Went here with the kids. When they walked us to a table I asked for a booth, the girl stopped and looked at me and said there are none open.....I counted 5 open booths and pointed to one. She let out a noticeable sigh and walked us over.
Food came out, everyone had there order except me. Finally when they came to check on us I let them know I was still waiting....20 mins after everyone else was finished with there food, my dinner came.
Haven't been back since. 

Also....they seem to put people with children on one half of the restaurant no matter how many children you have. 

So many other places to go...food here is ok at best, but not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"Quality was good and we were seated quickly and our food came promptly. Service was not great. When they brought dipping sauce, she dropped a cup of ranch on the table. Instead of cleaning her mess, she handed us a stack of napkins and walked away. We had to ask several times for drink refills and they finally came just before we paid and left. Doubt we'll be back to this location."}
{"text":"Good all around American food and specialty burgers. Reasonably priced, interesting 'beer shakes' and other interesting delicacies."}
{"text":"The few times we've came here it reminds us on why we shouldn't come here. The service is terrible and the food order is almost never right. Last time we went my chicken burger that a blob of mayo and lettuce, no tomato, no BBQ sauce, no onion straws. Although the waiter was very apologetic I refuse to come here again. I prefer the one on Centennial-they are always accommodating and friendly, our food is always right and the staff is friendlier."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the soft-opening last night. It was good! 

Definitely still some tweaks for them to work out, we waited almost 20 minutes to see a waiter at our table after we sat down. But Carol, who waited on us, was awesome. Food was decent. My wrap wasn't built with lots of care, but tasted great. The wife's vegan quinoa burger was great, according to her. 

Will be excited to see how much better they will get when we visit again!"}
{"text":"I have probably been to Red Robin a million times. Not once has my food been bad or inconsistent. The service, is pretty much a hit or miss. Sometimes you get someone good, and sometimes you get someone who just doesn't care. My favorite burger is the Whiskey River BBQ Burger (Petite) if a regular burger is a bit too much for you, ask for petite, they make a smaller patty at a lower price than what is stated on the menu."}
{"text":"Waitress and waiters are really nice but other than that this place is not the best service.

Our table had no drink menus. Our cheese sticks were not hot, warm but the cheese wasn't even melted. No utensils or napkins and took forever to get one. Main dish wasn't hot. 

My main thing was hot food! Probably coordination between when to take the food to the guests needs help!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! What actually got me to right this review was the excellent server we had in the bar area. His name is James. He was so at tentative and made our eating experience enjoyable as one can be. He is the perfect example of what service should be like. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My client wanted to come here for lunch. It was 107* outside. Red Robin was nice and cool inside.

I went with the fish and chips. A good portion of cod - 4 fat battered pieces and unlimited fries. I only had one serving BC there was plenty of food.

Our waiter was friendly & accomadating and he checked in many times.
It's funny I have a Red Robin 5 minutes from my house and have eaten there only once!"}
{"text":"Well for starters I had an email stating with a $10 purchase I could receive a free milkshake. When I showed it to my server she said I did not spend $10. The email did not specify the purchase had to be on one meal. We spent over $30. It was slow going getting our food and the buns were extremely crumbly which made for a sloppy sandwich. My husband stated his macaroni wasn't that great and my sons burger was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Love me a good burger. Although the burger prices keep going up they are yummy for the tummy. They now have kiosks at each table, bulky and distracting but it was quick to pay and have my receipt emailed to me instead of having a paper one. Overall it was a good experience and my lunchtime company (hubbin) was the best"}
{"text":"After a pretty bad first experience years ago at another location, I decided to try again because we are at Tempe Marketplace often anyway. What really surprised me was the taste and quality of the burgers. We were honestly expecting a subpar burger similar to Ruby Tuesday or Applebee's. However, we've thoroughly enjoyed every single burger we've ordered so far. The bottomless fries are always good, and service is usually good also. Only small con is that it tends to feel crowded because the tables are too close to each other so you often have to deal with awkwardly bumping elbows with other diners. Will definitely be back again to try other burgers and drinks."}
{"text":"I heart Red Robin!  

This is a huge burger chain and they know what they are doing!  It isn't a fancy place, but it is a very toddler/kid friendly restaurant.  This is great since my mini me is very much a toddler and gets into everything these days.  It is a very comfortable place for families to go, as well as to grab a tasty burger!

The menu is mostly fantastic burgers, but it seems every time I go there are even more options like salads, chicken sandwiches, fish options, and even pastas.  I have only had the burgers and the fish n' chips and have loved every bite.  You really can't go wrong with any of the burgers, though my faves are the Beresker, A1, and the Bleu Ribbon burgers.  Yum, yum, yummy!  And a little bit of drool too.

Now for the best part about Red Robin....Bottomless Steak Fries!  The fries here are amazing, especially with the special Red Robin Seasoning.  I love these fries and probably eat at least half of my body weight in them every time I go to RR.  

They also have a great loyalty card that you can sign up for.  Every 10th burger/entree you buy is free, you get a free burger during your birthday month, and you get a lot of freebies throughout the year.  And it is all free.  I love free!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, small restaurant, uncomfortable metal chairs. Friendly but slow service. Busy shopping center - a lot of traffic, ok if you can make a right in and out - that's why I stopped."}
{"text":"The service was nice and quick. There were a lot of little of children and the place was a bit loud at times. The food was fine. I got a chicken finger salad. I like their Royal burger as well. The fries could be cooked a little longer."}
{"text":"This is the 5th time we have come here and mostly because of our young son. Every time our food order is either messed up or cold or today messed up took forever and  cold. Don't know where the breakdown is here but I see the remodel is not going to fix this."}
{"text":"I like Red Robin in general. They have some interesting burger options aside from the standard. I especially like their mushroom burger as it is garlic heavy and loaded with mushrooms. But I always try to get something different when I come in. Usually I get a burger but I have tried a chicken sandwich as well. One thing sticks out in my mind at this location in particular. The food doesn't seem as fresh as it should. The fries are thin and over cooked for being steak fries. And the bun, whether on a burger or a chicken sandwich, always seems to be dried out. Dried to the point of breaking and crumbling. Almost stale you could say. The over all taste of the sandwich is alright but having a disappointing bun just leaves me feeling less than satisfied. I've not noticed this at other Red Robin locations. Mostly just this one. 

I will say the service I recieve once I am seated is usually pretty good. I am typically shown to the bar section to sit either at the bar or a high table. Being a single diner I suppose is the reason for that. But the person behind the bar, despite always being busy, is rather attentive. My order is taken right away and typically comes out quickly. Hard to complain about that.

I don't always end my meal with dessert but when I do, Red Robin has me covered. They have some cool alocholic desserts. Just the other night I had a root brewskie float. Alcoholic root beer poured over vanilla soft serve. I've also tried their Guiness beer shake. Any of their adult geared desserts are a fun departure from chocolate cake and ice cream. Why not end on a happy note."}
{"text":"Red Robin is known for their burgers and they really do makae a mean burger.  Ironically, burgers were not the primary reason I went in to Red Robin last week.  It was Cinco de Mayo and I really wanted a margarita and some Mexican food.  My dreams were quickly dashed when I passed up on two restaurants because of the corwded parking lots and busy mad house dining rooms.  I saw the Red Robin next to the Michoacan restaurant and figured they would have a bar that could serve me up a margarita and would perhaps not be too busy.  My hunch paid off and I got my margarita and dinner with little wait.  Since I was hoping for Mexican food and that is not he specialty of Red Robin  I went with the next best thing and ordered a guacamole bacon burger.  It did not look like much when it came out to me but you really cannot judge a book by its cover.  This burger was superb.  the guacamole was there and delicious without overwhelming the rest of the burger components. I was able to taste each topping as well as the awesome beefiness of the patty.  I could taste the char and it reminded me of a 4th of July backyard BBQ.  Oh, the memories that came flooding back to my mind.  All with one simple bite of a burger.  I don't know why I don't do this more often."}
{"text":"FIRST AND LAST TIME HERE 
We came for lunch around 1pm
Today and the place was packed ! So I thought awesome, this must be worth waiting for *just kidding* . What a disaster . Lunch took an hour to be seated and served a burger that was beyond gross ! I'm providing pics as proof that I am providing an  honest review . I ordered the BDL burger and a bowl of French onion soup. It was supposed to have sun dried tomatoes, arugula , and a mayo based  sauce that  made the burger and bun SWIM in grease I wish I was kidding , or even exaggerating!! I tried twice to pick it up and had grease running down my hands .. I also ordered a bowl of French onion soup that consisted of crunchy 1/2 cooked (not caramelized like they are supposed to be) onions, topped with 2 slices of soggy bread (not toasted) and melted cheese . I left hungry and pissed off . My time and my money were both wasted at this place . I would love to know what the crowds of people were ordering ?!?!?
On a side note the manager came over and apologized and removed the burger from the bill . He also gave us a coupon for free appetizer or dessert on our next visit . If anyone wants it let me know ! I will not waste another moment of my time or money here"}
{"text":"I dont know how anyone likes these \"burgers\". My wife and I have been there a few times with friends who have wanted to go and none of us have ever had a good time. The latest time, and the time that sparked this review, was the worst. The waitress really seemed like she didnt want to be there. Im she didnt but put a face on atleast. She got my order wrong but I told her ill just take what I got because I didnt want to wait another hour. The food was not good at all. These just dont taste like real burgers and thanks Red Robin for the unlimited horrible fries. Im done with this place forever. Im sure they wont notice though because there are alot of people out there without taste buds."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong getting a burger at this place. The fries are good when they come out hot and fresh unfortunately not like on our last visit. Cold and soggy fries. Please don't serve that to customers. I would rather wait 10 minutes for fresh fries. Servers are generally pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"I have been to red robins before but this red robins service was by far the BEST. we arrived 20 minutes before closing and asked if it was \"ok to order to go still even though they were closing soon\" they lady at the front said \"yes absolutely\" with no hesitation she even told us if we wanted we could still dine in. Most places wouldn't offer that right before closing time. 

Still ordered to go and the food was delicious!! For anyone who loves sweet potato fries, get them here and order the Chipotle sauce on the side to dip with. We ordered the A1 peppercorn burger and loved it as well as the royal red robin which obviously was delicious too.

Truly a good place to dine in or take out! We will for sure go back"}
{"text":"The A1 peppercorn burger or the Burn' Love burger?  Both are incredible.

Pro Tip: Get the bottomless Root Beer Float!

This particular Red Robin can be very hit or miss.  I feel like I've had both great service and terrible service, but the number of great experiences is enough to keep me coming back.

This particular restaurant is also famous amongst my family because one night I ordered the ghost pepper burger under the advice of the waiter because I told him I like spicy foods.  Problem was that I didn't know that ghost peppers are crazy hot.  I can not believe how hot this burger was, I could only eat 2/3 of it and tapped out.  It was past spicy and into the category of pain.  But what ever doesn't kill you... right?"}
{"text":"Food is what you expect from a chain restaurant, always the same with little imagination. You know what you are getting and it never dissapoints based on expectations. Our waitress however exceeded expectations. Jessie was attentive, friendly and did everything to make our lunch experience at Red Robin a pleasant one. If the manager reads this, Jessie is by far the best waitress I've ever had at a Red Robin."}
{"text":"The food is always good here.  But the new decor/design is so boring and makes you feel your at a high end restaurant.  Just not a fan of the decor or the pay at table games."}
{"text":"Red Robin is a good, solid choice if shopping in the Waterfront and in need of a place to grab a bite. Generally, there is no wait for food. At the longest, my husband and I recently had to wait 5 minutes for Sunday lunch. Both waitress service and food delivery are also pretty prompt. I often order the fried cod filets with either the fries, mac and cheese, or a Caesar salad on the side. I think that the food I receive is worth the $12 price tag."}
{"text":"I do love this place. I find it a bit on the pricey side, but the cost is worth the service. Sometimes the food isn't perfect, but they always try to make it right."}
{"text":"Great service great food! This place was clean upbeat. I would definitely recommend to friends and family"}
{"text":"Service is a little bit slow and the \"specials\" weren't explained properly. We were told by our server that $5.99 specials are on the \"box\" on the table - the box being a small cardboard cube display ad. A $5.99 salad was advertised and so was a $5.99 burger (which, incidentally, had mushrooms, provolone, and onion straws and was freakin' amazing). Sticking out of the cube was an ad for fish n' chips which a few people ordered. Much to all of our surprise, when the bill came with $11.99 charges for the fish n' chips, we asked the server about the lunch specials she herself pointed out to us. Her response was that she \"never told (us) that.\" 

All the food was good-to-excellent, but the flippant attitude that this young lady showed us when she herself had misled us left a bad taste in all of our mouths."}
{"text":"Worst Red Robin I've ever been to. Service was a joke and the food was cold. There is a great Red Robin down the street, it's worth the drive out of the way."}
{"text":"Free birthday sandwich! I ordered a chicken sandwich and did not like it grilled too much. The manager had the kitchen make a new sandwich with the crispy chicken even though I said it was fine! Good customer service. Unlimited basket of fries."}
{"text":"This is our go to burger spot. Yes, yes I know it's a chain restaurant so many foodies will frown but I.dont care we love it here! Staff is always friendly the food is always good and the atmosphere is always cheerful. We live beating everyone at the trivia games (although I honestly think it's rigged to make you think you are actually playing against other people but don't tell my girls that) I have to say I absolutely love the Blue Ribbon, the Madlove, the Burnin'Love and the good ol' traditional All American Red Robin ... and when Mike is.your server you can count on great service , a good laugh and an all around great casual dinning experience!"}
{"text":"Server was nice but it's a little loud. The food is good but some of the prices are high. We still like this place"}
{"text":"Food was hot, service was exceptional, beer was cold.  What more can a person ask for!!  The place opened in august, and I think that is why the review are so harsh. Opening right before Christmas next to a mall was probably a bad decision."}
{"text":"Very good burger. A little thing was wrong with the order and it was corrected promptly. Our server was so nice and all of them were quick. This place was busy as anything but we got a table within 15 minutes so don't let  a busy restaurant detour you. Don't miss this clean, friendly and good restaurant."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good burger and got close. They actually cooked it correctly which is rare (not pun intended) now a days. It is difficult to find a place that doesn't over cook it, even at higher end places. So I give Red Robin kudos for delivering on their signature product. The fries were OK also. 
However, all is not good. The service was mediocre at best. They got the type of roll I requested wrong. They offered to change it, but the correctly cooked burger would have gone back to the kitchen, the cheese was already melted on the toasted roll and I felt it would have been a bad move to change it.
Once done it took forever to get my bill and then to pay it. They blamed a lot of it on the computer.
So average experience. Decent food, mediocre service."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at this location until now. We walked in, waited with 2 other families for too long while all the employees ignored us. And when the hostess finally showed up, she looked like she'd rather have bamboo sticks stuck under her fingernails than seat us. Forget it! I had a bad feeling about how our meal would turn out, so we left."}
{"text":"We left another Red Robin location after being treated like dirt & came over to this one. We weren't griping necessarily, just commenting to the server about our experience, and he had the GM & manager come over & talk to us. The food was great, as always, and then they took $20 off our bill just for the inconvenience that the other location had caused us. Great staff, great food, and high on our list of places to eat. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the food only. Admittedly, we came in with a party of 10, but a restaurant this size should be able to accommodate that...especially since there were several empty tables in the place. The issue lies herein:   1)- we ordered ordered a 22 oz beer (twice) that came out at least 3 oz short each time. 2)-The fries are allegedly \"bottomless\" but you wouldn't know it here. The whole table got fries with their dishes, but the requested refills came out in not-large baskets and not only were the baskets not full, but there weren't as many as the number in our party.  Additionally, it took at least 15-20 minutes for refills to be delivered. Don't offer bottomless if you don't truly mean bottomless. 3)- our server seemed overwhelmed and we were underwhelmed by how often she came to our table and how slowly she responded to our requests. Normally, Red Robin is a reliable Franchise but today we were DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Worst burger I was ever served .. The patty was charred underneath, the toppings did not sit well..the all you can eat fries were undercooked to a point they were raw and stuck together..wish I had just sent it all back and left. Waste of 15 dollars times 3...the service was fast and friendly... will never eat there..."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  I'm from Seattle originally which is where Red Robin started and was one of my favorites.  Since I've been in Vegas, I'm always disappointed when I eat here.  Today, we waited over 5 minutes after being seated and saw no one else was being served either, so we just walked out.  Will never return!  Lunchtime on a Monday so no excuses!"}
{"text":"For Mother's Day my family decided in for lunch we were going to order a take out order to bring home for the elderly members of the family since it's harder to go out of the house now. My elderly aunt tried placing the order online with her Red Robin royal card but online system wasn't working , she called the store to try and place the order and mentioned to the employee that the online system was not working and would not take her order and told her to call IT department, so she did unable to talk to anyone from IT till 1 pm on a SUNDAY. She returned a call to the restaurant for the same employee to still not take her order over the phone. 

I took my aunt down to the restaurant around 1 pm to place the order in person for an employee to finally place the order but not honor her royal card saying she does not exist in their system . (Funny because they are the ones sending her emails and specialty promos for the royal card members only!) She paid the full price without her royal card discount and such for the Togo orders. But needless to say we will never return nor recommend this restaurant to any friends or family due to the extreme lack of customer service especially on a holiday."}
{"text":"I went to this Red Robin to drink beer and watch basketball a Friday in June. You woulda thought they were giving away free money the parking lot was so full. 

But I'll tell you, this restaurant was HUMMING!  Packed but running like a top, I saw every single server competent, on top of it; no one -NO ONE was complaining and we've all seen chaotic restaurants with problems breaking out like wild fires. Not here. 

I was tended to by Ethan, a very friendly young man who also knew his stuff. Kept a careful watch over me. Attentive, not over-bearing. 

Red Robin has survived by being good at what they do. I don't go to a Red Robin all that often (Tucson, Scottsdale, Denver) but this Avondale location is by far the best I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Went to this location last night for some French Onion Soup and also chose a side of steamed broccoli.  Soup was delicious.  When I received my soup, I asked the waitress if it didn't come with garlic toast.  She had to go to the back and ask and said \"no\".  I know the menu said it did, but rather than make a stink, I let it go.  If you don't know the menu, then you shouldn't quote anything until you check the menu.  Whoever she asked, didn't know it either.  Won't be back.  Very disappointed and a little upset. The waitress expected a tip, thank goodness I wasn't responsible for it this time."}
{"text":"ACK! 
I haven't been to a Red Robin in years. I remembered liking it. However yesterday was very iffy and not sure if I would go back. 

I went here yesterday with a friend for lunch. 

Our waitress was very uninterested in us being there. 

We ordered our drinks and some onion rings. The onion rings come out as a tall stack on this tall metal object, I was leaning forward talking to my friend when the waitress tries to shove the onion rings onto the table damn near taking my eye out. She was close enough that I felt the heat of the onion rings on my face. 

Aside from near blindness, they were good. 

We both ordered grilled chicken sandwiches, and both agreed that they were the most god awful grilled chicken sandwiches there could be. despite the gobs of sauce on them, the chicken itself had no flavor...and was rubbery. 
I had some sort of pesto cibata chicken, the bun was soggy on one side. Soggy bread makes me gag, its the worst. Wet bread ::shivers:: they put a pesto sauce on it, some sort of diced tomato concoction and then a very odd flesh toned sauce. No clue. I took two bites off the none soggy side and that's all I could bear. 

I will say though, the french fries are freaken Yum! That is what saved me from starving to death. My friend doesn't like confrontation so I didn't send it back, if I was there with anyone else, this meal would have sure been sent back."}
{"text":"This was one of the dirtiest restaurants we have ever eaten at, I would NOT recommend the establishment!  The temperature was well above 75-78 degrees, there was food on the floor, dried condiments on the table we sat at, dirty glassware...just a really bad place."}
{"text":"For starters the OMG nachos we ordered left me thinking OMG did I just really pay for this. The burgers were not satisfying and when we asked for more unlimited fries they took a long time to bring them, by the time they got to our table they were cold and a small amount. Do not plan to go to any Red Robin for a long period of time."}
{"text":"Burgers here are amazing! Campfire sauce plus bottomless fries make this a top spot for my family and I. I highly recommend the royal red robin burger! It has bacon, cheese, and an egg on top. Milkshakes pretty good too."}
{"text":"Great food but when they are busy...plan on being here for a few hours. I'm writing this review after I ordered my royal red robin an hour ago and still no food! My bottomless fries aren't here yet either!!"}
{"text":"Food and service was very good. 
The burger was great.
Outdoor seating was very comfortable.
Will go again."}
{"text":"This rating is based off of two visits our family made  this past week. The first visit was Friday. We got seated and weren't even greeted for 15 minutes. A waitress came by and asked if someone has taken our drink order yet, we said no and she said well I guess I will take care of you guys tonight. 5 minutes after she left another waitress came by saying she will help us, we advised that we have already been helped. The food came out good but the service this day was terrible. Every time we asked for something the waitress made us feel like it was a bother. 

Today was our second visit, a man named Micha was our server. He immediately greeted us and took our drink order. Our food was amazing and service was outstanding. So I guess your experience will just depend on which server you get."}
{"text":"AWFUL SERVICE! Rip off management charged us for games we did not play and charged extra when we asked for another side of sauce. The fries were cold and soggy even when we asked for fresh ones and the strawberry milkshake tasted like it was mafe from water not milk. This location sucks!"}
{"text":"Had the Freckled lemonade, gourmet burger and the garlic fries. My meal was very good. The waitress was awesome, pleasant, and made sure that we had everything that we asked for. Overall, my experience was satisfying."}
{"text":"We stopped by for the Tavern Double Tuesday. It was the last of the Cardinal's football season which is a buy a double tavern and get another burger free promotion. We've been to other Red Robin's but interestingly have never been to this location that is so close to our house.

When we stop by Red Robin it's usually for a burger and crispy fish sandwich. The bottomless fries come with both so we'll usually get onion rings with one of the meals and share. We know what to expect with the burgers which is well cooked and pretty tasty. We enjoy our favorite burger spots too much to stop her often but it's about as good as you'll get without stepping up to a gourmet burger. For example, they don't ask how you want it cooked. I like the crispy fish sandwich though and get it each visit. The seasoning for the fries is nice but we always seem to fill up on the fries waiting for the meal so not sure why we ordered a hummus plate appetizer. The hummus was the plain type but had some flavor. Would be nice for the plate to come with a couple different types of hummus. I can't say it was freshly made but it was good with the carrots, cucumbers and kettle chips.

Their service was good. We had to wait a couple minutes to be seated. There wasn't anybody up front so we kind of stood there for a while. Our server was awesome. She was very friendly, had some good recommendations for appetizers and was attentive.

This location is clean and not too noisy. They have TV screens to catch the game but the volume is low so you can't hear it unless your in the bar area. We'll be back sometime to try something other than burgers."}
{"text":"Not my best experience. 
Service very slow
Brought the wrong burger out after a very long wait 
Buffalo bites dry and cold
Whiskey river wrap dry and not very full. Mostly tortilla
Cold fries
Waited FOREVER for dessert and check
And worst of all - beer was not very cold! For shame! Just yuck. 

I'm not sure why everything took so long today. Horrible lunch. 
Server was nice, but... Everything in general not so much."}
{"text":"Red Robin is our go-to spot when we need a good, reliable hamburger fixed the way we want it..  I love that they give you options - buns, sauces, type of fries, etc.  Fun, energetic and usually noisy, but good.  They recently refreshed their décor, and service is good. 

My former favorite was the bonsai burger, but now I love their Southern Charm - bacon, onions, bbq, etc. yum. 

My son's favorite item is their refillable root beer float.  

A couple of things that need a  little attention - the on-the-table bill-pay tablet does not always work, so it took us a while to get checked out.  And, apparently our rewards membership expired (we don't always remember to use it), but yet we still get their emails, and we had to have a manager give permission to use the discount that was sent to us via email.  So corporate - avoid confusion!! If you are going to \"expire\" our membership, then take us off the mailing list so we know."}
{"text":"Never was a big fan of Red Robin's, it's not that I didn't like it I just never bother going. But when I heard about the bees knees I wanted to give it a try and it was so delicious! Totally something different and people should give it a try. Customer service was great as well didn't have any problems and was very friendly!"}
{"text":"We come here because the kids experience is unreal and the veggie patty is AWESOME. Bottomless fries, good drinks and predictable service. In a hurry! No problem. Wanna sit for awhile(you guys better tip right) sure stay and have a few. I didn't give the full 5 because every single Red Robin's floor and dining room is normally a little  wrecked. I know the place has tons of kids and we don't go easy on the crayons, fries and Mac n cheese messes and spilling everything everywhere but this is a part of the Red Robin business model. We'll keep coming back forever."}
{"text":"First off,  this is my local lunch location and never had any problems here.  Figured I'd bring in the family since it was pay day,  for a treat. Came in on a Friday night around 630 and seated within 5 minutes. Ordered appetizers and dinner, appetizers came out with the dinner and not before. Specifically asked for no onions, still got onion toppings on appetizers as well as in burgers. Plates were chipped on corners. Clam chowder cup of soup tasted like chemicals, I don't think the cup was rinsed properly from dish washing? I'd like to give benefit of doubt as this was the first time we'd have any issues here. Anyhow,  soup was taken off bill,  no comment about chipped plate when brought to employees attention. Maybe just a bad night since it was a full house."}
{"text":"I recently got to re-live my youth by having lunch at Red Robin recently. When I was in middle and high school out in Pennsylvania, this was THE PLACE to go. Probably because it shared a parking lot with a movie theater, one of the few activities for kids in my metro. 

RR has undergone a bit of identity change - it's still got all the pieces of flair on the wall that haven't changed since the late 90s when I started going, and the signature menu items are there, but they seem to be branding their menu up and have increased the prices to match. A $15 burger, Red Robin? Really? 

Most of their items are in line with any major \"neighborhood bar and grill\" chain, though, and they're probably my favorite among their peers. They consider \"anything between two buns\" a burger, so I was easily able to swap a grilled chicken patty in for their A1 Peppercorn burger. Unfortunately, the chicken had kind of a weird texture, but it looked and tasted fine so I rolled with it. The steak fries are still as delicious as I remembered them, and they've still got the poppyseed dressing that I dunk them into with abandon. 

Our server on this trip was very nice but a little discombobulated - he was running around like a madman and carrying several different orders at a time, which led to some sloppiness. My to-go box, for example, had its inside christened with melted vanilla milkshake. 

On a good day, I could maybe bump them up to four stars (they are what they are, and I'm not going to ding them for being a chain), but the freezing temperature (I was still uncomfortable wearing both my and my boyfriend's hoodies) and crowded, awkward parking lot just weren't my jam."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to try it b out. She loved their milk shakes, I had a Black and Bleu burger, done just right. Staff was very attentive, our drinks were always full.

Nice place to have a meal"}
{"text":"Never going back.food came out  cold, grilled cheese was almost fried.service was slow even when the place was empty."}
{"text":"I love going to Red Robin. The staff is always friendly. They have a great place to watch sports (different section of the restaraunt) the beer is always flowing and the burgers are awesome. I love getting a bonzi burger with a onion rings. Also I like getting the jalapeño coins with cheese sticks before all that. This is a place I like to go with friends, dates, family and before sports games. The waitress Nicole in the sports area and Lexy at the bar are helpful. I came to watch the Cavs Celtics playoff game and they made sure to take care of me. Also check for the waitress Jess for busting her butt as well as Hannah at the bar and the manager William. Sara is also an awesome waitress"}
{"text":"The visit couldn't have been more disappointing. We left before eating because management was so incredibly rude after we questioned their policy to ID anyone who looks younger than 40."}
{"text":"Ate here before and it was a good experience. Ate here this past week and was not good at all. The burgers and wraps we ordered were cold. The burger had an odd taste to it(maybe old). The fries were cold and soggy. They took the burger back and we got a new one but not much warmer... We got hot fries the third time they came out, but it was 30 minutes later so wasn't hungry.... 3 stars bc of the first time I ate here was 5 and this was a 1... let's do better next time..."}
{"text":"I really don't like this place.  I had a burger with way too much fancy stuff.  I think I had an onion focacia bun and it just sucked.  Overpriced and not good."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as a review to my future self...

Hi Future Self,

This is Past Self. Did you just drive into the Red Robin parking lot? Then turn around and find somewhere else for your meal. \"It's convenient,\" you might say. Or \"everywhere else has a longer wait.\" Don't let this discourage you, you CAN have a way better experience somewhere else.

You will undoubtedly walk in and wait at least a few minutes, only to be brought to a table that is either unclean, missing utensils, or something else. The wait staff will arrive only to provide poor service or forget about you all together and you will need to go in search of a team member or manager to help you in another part of the restaurant.

When you finally receive your food you will be underwhelmed and left empty, sad that you ultimately did decide to have your meal here. \"It's really not that great,\" \"I don't know why we came here,\" you'll say to yourself.

Future Self--I implore you, go somewhere else and get lured in by the bottomless fries.

Best Regards,
Past Self"}
{"text":"The first thing I want to say is how excellent the customer service was. My friend wanted to use her birthday free hamburger she was unaware that it was only good for the month of her birthday she thought she had 12 months to use it. The manager on duty allowed her to have her meal free even though it was two months past her birthday. I thought that was very nice and they didn't really have to do that they also offered her a free Sunday. The meal itself was delicious we both ordered hamburgers cooked just the way we wanted them. The first batch of french fries was a little on the cold side but when we got a refill they were hot and fresh. The white sangria was very refreshing and delicious"}
{"text":"Worst Red Robin I've been to! I made the mistake of going for lunch right when it opened at 11am. The staff was half asleep, inattentive and we were seated near the restrooms where the smell was awful! The food was ok but the smell & service was big disappointment. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you can believe it, this was my first ever visit to red robin and I will definitely go back. I love burgers and theirs was very good. The bottomless fries was a cool touch. 

The highlight of the meal was definitely the milk shake. I got a mint brownie milk shake and it was delicious. It was a great size and its flavor was awesome. I would go back just for that. 

The waiter was attentive and price was fair. I will certainly go back again."}
{"text":"So sad that my banzai burger was so under seasoned and flat. The burger itself was very small as well. The pineapple should've been super sweet after grilling and it appeared the grill lines were painted on in teriyaki sauce.... Very disappointed.... Service was mediocre and she offered a dessert to console us..... We weren't angry,  I was disappointed.... I didn't hate it because I ate it,  but I expected so much more of a specialty ..... It wasn't as good as a fast food restaurant even......and if I pay for a sauce,  I should get a full container..... It was 1/3 full..... Felt as if I was bothering them with my business...... Never sent anything back but did express my disappointment to the server.  Do we have to scream to get great products..... I'd be ashamed if it was my restaurant!"}
{"text":"Started off having to wait for 15 minutes to try to sell us drinks plenty of open tables then we got seated waitress said all I'll get you Fry's never came and tell her meals were served hamburgers were good service was terrible probably never go back because of that have to wait for 15 minutes to buy drinks"}
{"text":"If you're into exceedingly slow service, eating your salad that was made with lettuce from last year without utensils, and communicating in a special code where apparently the word \"sprite\" means \"water\", then this is the place for you. But in all honesty, this is just an understaffed chain restaurant. To the people sitting in the booth behind us who were acting like Red Robin might lose one of their Michelin stars because of your screaming complaints: relax. They're doing their best with what they have. You're coming to a Red Robin near the city at 10 o'clock on a Friday night. You get what you get."}
{"text":"Hey Red Robin, if you are never going to get PBR in stock, then take it off your menu as the featured special. Do you just want your servers to constantly explain to people why there is no beer that is prominently displayed on the menu? 
White out is $3.99 at Staples. 
Other than that the burgers are great."}
{"text":"This place a very good for burgers but as I'm learning it's also good for seafood. I decided to get the seafood platter but I really don't like cod so I asked for extra shrimp and clam strips which our server accommodated. Beers are well priced and everything is super clean. Our server Danielle is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this location a handful of times. The space is a little cramped and when you stand up you always seem to be in the way of other people trying to get by. This isn't a huge concern of mine though.

This visit, I ordered the new Smoke & Pepper burger because I LOVE PEPPER. Our waitress was very prompt on helping us and starting us with drinks. Now, she asked if I wanted some pink or no pink. I always say some pink because as excepted, it's usually more cooked than I prefer. There was no pink at all. It was a little dry, but not terrible. You just would think for a $13 burger they could at least not overcook it. The bacon was a little chewy and the pickles were very flimsy (I like when they're crunchy).

Overall, I did enjoy the burger, but to me it's not worth $13. We went because we had gift cards and didn't feel like cooking dinner. The staff was very friendly and fast, just the food itself was meh. I'm sure I'll return in the future though because I'm a sucker for their fries."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. Being someone who suffers from different food allergies,  It makes it complicated to go out and eat. Red Robin is a great place to get that burger craving without feeling scared of getting sick. They are more than happy to work with you and adjust whatever to make you feel happy and safe. I recently had a slight issue with my take out order ( mistakes do happen and that is totally okay!) When I called I spoke with the manager Nathan and he was so kind, patient and was willing to hear me out. He felt bad for the inconvenience and made it up for it so easily and quickly. He really cares about his customers and wants them to be happy. I love it here, they are a great!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here before catching a movie during the Thanksgiving holiday.  The hubby and I don't usually choose chain restaurants, but it was the kids' choice and we actually hadn't eaten at a RR in quite a few years, so we agreed.  I used to LOVE the steak fries, but this particular night, they were dry and overcooked...big disappointment.  All burgers ordered were decent and pretty much what we expected.  Nothing spectacular about them.  The service, however, was great and they weren't as crowded as we expected them to be given the time of year.  Overall, it was a pretty good visit and I wouldn't be opposed to returning if it was suggested by others.  :)"}
{"text":"The burgers are not as amazing as you would think they would be. There is a lot of variety in terms of the burgers they offer. With the bottomless fries, you'll be so full from your burger you'll only eat one order of them and maybe half of the second order. The burger was well done and I enjoyed it but it didn't make me go crazy about it like some other food."}
{"text":"Didn't even make it to the table.  Told a certain wait time, waited twice as long were never seated.  Got a drink from the bar, a vojito, strawberries stuck in straw and mint pulled too fine"}
{"text":"The burgers are always good, however the cleanliness was lacking today. To sit at a table to eat lunch and have the two tables next to you have dirty dishes the whole meal is unacceptable. Four people on break in the dining room, only two wait person visible, no greeter at the door, had to be noticed by one of the two wait persons to be seated. My wait person finally had a chance to clear the table next to us at the end of our meal. I would suggest staggered breaks to keep the dining room running smoothly and to keep it clean. Nothing less appetizing than the appearance of a dirty restaurant."}
{"text":"All of the restaurants at the southpoint were booked for 2 hours (even though lots of tables were open) so we had to find a different place to eat after watching the new lincoln movie... first place we came to was Red Robin on S. Eastern. 

Servers were friendly and attentive and we never had to wait for our glass to get empty before we'd get it refilled.

I ordered the onion rings, a french onion soup, and one of the new burgers (it had some kind of hawaiian slaw on it).

Onion rings were good, but the french onion soup never came... 

Burger had a good flavor to the slaw however the MEAT had no flavor at all! Not sure how they managed to do this but they did... no seasoning, no taste, nothing... It didn't even taste grilled..

other then that everything else was fine, drinks are great and the service was top notch. i'll be returning to try to get an update in for this Red Robin."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. However, I got a burger that wants what I wanted. Great costumer service. Otherwise I would give it a five star."}
{"text":"Take Out at Red Robin Burgers on the Hottest day of the year and gave  a try. You would think with record breaking temperature the take out order entry person would offer a glass of water or comment about how hot it is or at least hustle you for a something cold to drink, but didn't happen. There were two of us sitting at the bar so maybe she was to busy. I would expect that kind of non-service at a  drive thru but not at a \"high end\" burger place.
The food: Burger was OK, nothing extra. Fries were good. Take out Box was attractive."}
{"text":"Rather disappointed with particular location. Yes, they just opened. And yes, the staff is still working the bugs out. But come on... I had to literally ask my server 5 times for napkins and utensils (which my son and I should of gotten from the beginning). 
I decided to order something I used to order at the other locations I visited :The Royal Robin (bacon cheese burger with a fried egg on it). The egg was runny and the bacon wasn't cooked all the way. I had them take it back to fixed this problem, and they brought back another burger with the same issues. 
I honestly would stay clear of this location for a year until they resolve this issue with the staff and the back of the house."}
{"text":"BOTTOMLESS FRIES need  I say more.  Burgers are great and service is reliable.   Salads if u want to be good but you can always steel the fries from your company.  Want dessert grab a shake or have a beer to relax....."}
{"text":"I often want to shy away from criticizing companies that  mess up gluten free offerings because it's so easy for them to decide it's not worth it and remove them altogether. 
 
That being said...  

If you pay an extra $1 to have an item that will stop you from feeling like death for a few hours it would be nice if it your burger was between it.
Should that part be messed up  then it wouldn't just be taken away,  swapped over, and then given back now that the meats cooled and a lot of the juices/ additions were stuck to the old bread. it's not as appetizing as it sounds.

How about offering to remake it, a new fresh burger just like the one we paid for?  

The fiery Jolokia burger is nowhere near as fearsome as it should be. E.G., it's lower than a raw habanero which is not what I was looking for which is a damn same as it really tastes great  and should I ever want to blend up a burger to feed to a small child I'll keep it in mind. I'm as harsh to a company proportional to their claims of  how spicy they claim their food is. 

Overall this location gets a 2, the burnt to hell coffee that came out on the first attempt should get you a 1. In their defense the \"fresh\" pot was nearly as acrid so it's hard to think that there's not some cost cutting on coffee occurring but most places that late in the day ask me if it's ok to wait while the make a new pot, not give you whatever's stuck to the carafe at the time"}
{"text":"After watching an advert for large burgers in 3d Phoenix was sunny with no sign of cheeseburger. Didn't  stop at the nearest place, Johnny Rockets ,and we went a bob bob bobbin' along to Red Robin. 
Near 4 in the afternoon isn't a busy time but the service-dividend one would hope to reap wasn't  present. 

Greetings, placement, balloon for kid all happy:) time to drinks good. Then not so much. 

Ordered a burger that had jalapenos as part of the garnish. What i got was double fried, at least, and cold .While the server did go back and get some  it's a pain in the ass to have to open up, pick them out, and wait for the new ones to get back. It's a small thing? Maybe so small that anyone with brains would not serve cold, fat sodden and about as far from crispy as you can get in the first place.Paltry number of fries ( seemingly you can ask for more but found that out a little too late

The bun was claimed to be a jalapeno,meant to be chipotle mayo  and the burger was meant to have seen cayenne. Tasted fine, just not gourmet  in terms of ingredients and presentation.

My wife's BLTA was the straggliest SINGLE piece of bacon we've seen in a long time and the 2 piece of avocado  seemed to have visited the same health farm as the pig:) 

Slow refills, had to ask for mine. Wife's refilled but way late in meal. 
Poor value. realistically it's about 2.25 rounded down."}
{"text":"Crap Crap Crap - I have to say - I Hardly EVER fill out Reviews but, I ate at this restaurant yesterday with my two boys. I may be becoming a bit of a crabby old man but 1. since when is a hamburger $15 bucks!!!? 2. Since I guess I was going to spend that much on a sandwich I ordered the salmon burger (Not sure of the embellished fancy menu name - you can find it) it was $15! They served me a small sandwich (Like something you would get at circle k) and a handful of french fries so it was a rip off - nuff said. Then I took a bite - the DRIEST piece of fish ever and the lemon and dill they put on it was TOOO much - tasted horrible ... I'm Done - DON'T EAT HERE -"}
{"text":"I love me some Red Robin! I am never disappointed with their burgers. I have tried almost all of them. My favorite is the royal red robin!! They have good drinks and specials. Also the service is pretty great! Rocio attended us tonight and she was AMAZING!! Rocio always had our drinks coming and she was accurate on our order and fast! Love coming here."}
{"text":"It's Red Robins....  pretty standard fare.  I've been to this location before and plenty of others.  The service is always good, usually very friendly.  I'll be back again I'm sure, kids always love it."}
{"text":"Hey everyone Great news your local Arrowhead Red Robin is offering FREE dessert to anyone who gets a FREE Red Royalty Card until June 23rd! Not just usable once but once a day until the 23rd! Swing by and ask of a manager to get your Red Royalty Card tell them Joe T sent you and get a FREE Balloon too haha."}
{"text":"Red Robin has the BEST burgers in town! You taste the smoky char on the meat with every bite! They put the perfect amount of cheese on the burger and everything compliments each other so well! The Sriracha burger is my fav! A hint of spice & the fried little onions#Nom nom! I've had it a few times! It melts in your mouth! I add mayo to each bite! Bombness! The best part about it is that it's only $6.99 which includes bottomless fries! Oh yeah!

The Bonsai wings are boneless teriyaki wings that have pineapple plopped over them! AMAZING! You taste the smoky char on them as well! Dip em' in ranch & Oh honey, you're in for a treat! 

The O-ring shorty is the bomb as well! It's a 6-ring tower of fat thick crust battered onion rings & it's the bomb with the campfire ranch for dippin'! 

The straw lem is good! I would prefer a little more lemonade fresh lemon taste to it, but I love the fat sweet strawberries infused throughout the glass! They are  so good that we eat them! Love the botomless free refills! Also love their bottomless fries! Pour seasoning salt over them & Dip them in ranch#Money baby! Hahaha

I love the curbside that Red Robin offers! You call ahead & they bring everything out to you in a flash! On New Years Eve we sat inside & enjoyed our food! We had a FUN time! We will stay coming back!!!! :)"}
{"text":"I've ordered through Grubhub twice and both times they messed up my order. The first time they brought me chicken and fries when I ordered fish and chips. This time I ordered pretzel bites with my order and I never received them. Thankfully Grubhub is on top of their stuff and got me a refund but I blame the restaurant for not checking that the orders are right. I'm over them at this point and will probably not order from them again."}
{"text":"This was my first time here at this location and I was impressed. We were seated quickly and our server, Dana, greeted us shortly after. Our drinks were brought out quick, and our orders were taken shortly after. All our questions about the food was answered. Props to our server for being so good and quick. We take note of things like that. Food was delicious as always. Would definitely be back and I recommend if you're craving a burger :]"}
{"text":"I don't know... maybe our waiter Grady was an extra from The Walking Dead because he acted like he had no life in him!!!  He never came and asked us if everything was good and then brought us cold food when he decided to show up.  The suckiest part about it was it was my husbands birthday, which I had told anyone that would listen!!!  No singing!!   Ol' Deadman Walking brought us our bill and I was like, \"What about the birthday song?\"  Forget it Grady!!  We went home and sang to our Birthday Boy and believe me it was WAY better.  The service just sucked!!!  If you don't want to be there then do us all a favor and call in sick!"}
{"text":"This busy location is located inside the Galleria Mall in Henderson. Great burgers and sandwiches. Good prices. Great service- refills are quick. Bottomless Freckled Lemonade (strawberries) @ $3.99 (worth it- mmmm) and endless steak fries with signature seasoned salt (at your table). Open 7 days. Fun kitsch ambiance (like Appleby's/TGIF); casual American dining. One of three locations left in Las Vegas. All good reasons to come on down. 

The best ones to try: Whiskey River BBQ Burger (my husband's favorite, so he always orders this one), Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Sandwich (my favorite), Blackened Chicken Sandwich, Fish sandwich, and Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap (I might order this one again- that's how good it was). I don't really like steak fries but theirs is very good. My husband always asks for ranch. The lemonade is really good. Both the fries and the lemonade are bottomless.

It's sad that the one at Decatur/Sahara closed- we celebrated my husband's 30th there. We go to this one now."}
{"text":"Got the golden treatment here today, I ordered some hot wings, when they arrived I noticed it had Bleu Cheese crumbles on them. I loathe Bleu Cheese but I loath complainers more so I just scraped them off. My server noticed that I was having problems and immediately offered to drop some new wings. I declined because the crumbles scraped off easy enough, then the bartender/ manager offered to adjust my bill, I told him it wasn't necessary and thanked him. Even if the food was horrible which it wasn't I'd be thrilled to dine here again."}
{"text":"Really the only downside on this place is the environment.  Too many kids running around.  Where are their parents?

You can't go wrong with all you can eat steak fries.  Two reasons: first, they are steak fries.  Steak fries are how fries should be prepared.  I should be able to taste some potato.  I'm so tired of the crispy grease sticks all the burger joints have these days.  Second, it's all you can eat.  
'Nuff said.

I usually get the bleu ribbon burger.  Good sized patty, a little pink on the inside.  Bleu cheese and onion straws.  It's delicious.

I also get the girly strawberry lemonade.  It's unlimited refills, and it's awesome.  I don't care how sissy I look.

Anyways, everything is affordable.  I leave feeling full.  The service is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Never mind! Walked in on a Tuesday night at 9 pm. Place wasn't busy, only a few tables. Nobody was up at the host stand but we were sure someone heard us because of how loud their door slams. After five minutes of waiting, and no one acknowledging us, we decide to walk in a little bit more to get someone's attention. Finally, two different servers made eye contact with us but didn't say a word and looked the other direction. Even made eye contact with some kitchen staff. No one said a word. A simple \"be right with you\" would've been fine. But even after being seen, no one came to seat us after another five minutes. We then thought maybe they're closing up, but why wouldn't they tell us that? But they weren't closed yet for another hour! If Red Robin's goal is to ignore customers until they go away, well then, they've achieved that."}
{"text":"We go to Red Robin once in a while; the food and service have always been pretty consistent. It's nothing fancy but the food has always been good enough for me. We went last week with our toddler and the food was good as usual, but we had standout excellent service. Our server was so incredibly friendly and went out of his way to make our experience a good one, I was very impressed. 

It's definitely a good place for families; they have a decent kid's menu with both healthy (apple slices, oranges, salad, grilled chicken) and indulgent (corn dog, pizza, fries) choices, and they hand out crayons and a coloring sheet, so that's a plus in my book. And I do love me some freckled lemonade!

Are the burgers as good as, say, Burgatory? Hell no. But if you get a gift card or have family (like I do) that are sometimes scared of non-chain restaurants, I can definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time here definitely a family restaurant I liked not having to worry if my child is being too loud but the tables are a little too close together aside from there lots to see different type of decorations all over to see the menu was little overwhelming too much to choose from but went with my first choice a teriyaki chicken burger with side of fries strawberry lemonade was delicious my burger was very tasty loved the favor our waiter was very nice will definitely return have option for outside sitting and have plenty to keep kids busy from coloring menus to the balloons on a stick"}
{"text":"Like the other Red Robin's in the Charlotte area, this one started out great when it first opened. The food was out pretty quick and it was hot. The service was good and good consistently. We used to frequent this place on our trips to the mall. Now its almost never busy, the service is lack luster. The manager is typically seated somewhere in the lobby chatting it up with someone for the duration of our visit. The food comes out cold, even though they arent busy. The only reason i give it two stars is because the kids get free refills on thier macaroni and cheese, (one of very few restaurants that do that) and because i am actually a fan of this franchise ii still believe they can turn things around. But until I read that things have changed, we wont be going back anytime soon.

Oh, one other thing. The bottomless fries come out 8-10 fries at a time. We counted every time. Barely enough to cover the bottom of the basket. And you have to wait 10-15 minutes between refills, if you see your server that often. If you dont mind waiting, ask for the campfire mayo.. thats a nice freeby they will throw in if you ask for it."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to Red Robin.  The staff was nice and helpful.

I ordered the Guacamole And Bacon Burger.  It was a delicious burger, a bit messy trying to eat it but still a good burger.  My rating was from the experience I had.  It's a nice place, but it's not really a restaurant I would crave to go back. It's a nice place with a good staff, but the location is close to Dillard's so it's further away from the rest of Downtown  Summerlin. If I'm in the area, I wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"We always come to red robin! Love it, can't go wrong with bottomless fries. We ordered burgers and the queso dip like always, but tonight it was different. The queso wasn't made properly apparently because even our server noticed. Our server was great, her name was Maria. She took the queso off the dip because she could tell we weren't fans which was super nice of her. The staff is always so nice, even when the food isn't on point for us they are the reason we come back :) thanks Maria!"}
{"text":"Pretty average experience for a chain burger joint. 
They have a 21+ section with sports on the big screen (no sound), electronic trivia games on the table ($1.99) and no kid's birthday parties (thankfully). The service was decent, the food was good and the unlimited fries came out surprisingly fast compared to other locations I've been to. 
The fries are steak fries. They don't have skinny fries!"}
{"text":"My 4- year old likes this place. He was disappointed that they stopped giving out balloons. The food is Ok and they have a respectable beer and cocktail selection.  As far as the food, it is predictable and decent."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could.
We went on a saturday afternoon for a quick bite. We walked into the bar where we were the only people on sitting on high tops. Our server came in and asked us what we wanted to drink, we put in our food order at the same time. At 10 mins in, people are sitting down and ordering. Our server is bringing out food left and right. he tells us our food \"will be right out\". About 25 minutes later several people are now sitting at the bar high tops and some of them are eating and a couple of guys who sat down after us were already finished with their meal. We call our server over and tell him that people who sat down after are already finished with their meal, he says \"Oh, don't worry your food will be right out.\" An indication that he was clearly incompetent was when he put in a food order after ours and is  bringing it out before ours. We tell him that we would need our food to to go because we had places to be. About 10 minutes later the manager comes out (with no food in hand) and says that they must have lost our ticket in the back and he will go back there and see what's going on. At this point we can't tolerate anymore incompetence so we leave hungry after waiting over 45 mins. 
This location is the worst service I've experienced. Even a hefty gift card couldn't make up for this awful experience."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in well over 30 years at ANY restaurant. Our waitress, Laura, failed to come around for water refills & forgot to bring part of our order. We had to ask another waiter for water refills. The people sitting next to us got their food well before we did and they came in long after we did. EXTREMELY NOISEY! If I was there alone I would have got up and walked out, but we had guest with us. We were all disappointed with the service. WILL NEVER RETURN!!!"}
{"text":"No plastic in my burger just friendly and fast service. not the best or worst place to go in Goodyear but a chill and relaxing hipster joint. Good burger and okay on the wallet. The strawberry lemonade is killer good, I think I drink 6+ in one meal. Our server gave us everything we asked for and did not forget about us which is more than I can say about other places around here (macaroni grill)."}
{"text":"Red Robin as usual has great meal options. I enjoy the Whiskey burger with some pink , can't go wrong. Not to mention their Fries."}
{"text":"This place is always great for a quick bite. Burgers with the endless fries are unbeatable. This place is clean, staff is friendly. For those of us with kids this places staff always shows patience to my kids, that's huge place. Enjoy guys when you come in."}
{"text":"I asked for a burger done medium, they brought out the most charred, burnt, disgusting burger I have ever had. Two stars because they didn't make me pay for it. Not going back."}
{"text":"The hostesses are HORRIBLE and rude, especially Kiera. Our waitress was very nice but the kitchen sent out our orders wrong and cold. Tables surrounding us were never bussed. The manager seemed at a loss for what to do. I like their burgers but the need serious improvements. Keep your wait staff and get rid of everyone else would be my advice. See posted pics.

* Epilogue:  Both Red Robin and the Kiera sent me messages of apology and Red Robin sent me a gift card to make up for it.  I haven't been back yet so I cannot upgrade my review significantly but at least they are trying to make things right."}
{"text":"It has been a very long night, my family and i had just finished watching a local high school lacrosse game and decided to visit Red Robin. As soon as we walked through the door we were greeted by a unfriendly host who questioned the amount of people we had. We were then seated by Lindsay our waitress, when she visited the table she began to laugh. There was no alleged reason for the burst of laughter and it was extremely inappropriate. She then took our orders and when the food came my child's bacon cheeseburger was medium-rare when we asked for well-done. We then ordered shakes and it took 20 minutes for us to receive them. This Red Robin was not busy."}
{"text":"For the cost of what you pay for the burgers, I would have expected a much better taste, I was very disappointed.  However, the reason I will not return is because I asked for a glass of water with my meal and the water tasted like tap water full of chlorine!  I cant believe with the prices on the menu, they don't filter their water!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write anything bad but I really had to mention the issues at this particular restaurant.  The seat I sat at smelled like dirty water, the carpet looks like it has not been cleaned since they opened(which is probably what I smelled while I was sitting down. All this made me start to look closer at a few things.  Looks like there not doing to much of a deep clean while they are closed like crevices of the seating areas, seats, walls, even where the seats booths connect to the wall. It's really just about being as clean as possible and right now this restaurant is lacking that aspect.  The food was ok.  My food was warm and tasted like it had been sitting for a while and didn't taste very good. I normally love red robin fries and food is always pretty decent.... Just not here.  I am not sure I would come back here.  I might check reviews before I even think about it.  As a last note... My waitress was great thank you for the good customer service"}
{"text":"Took my family here to celebrate a birthday. Burgers were not bad but the kids really enjoyed rhe bottomless root beer floats and fries. The 5 stars are for our server Forest. He was swamped but kept our drinks full and table clean. He was polite even though he was being stretched. If I were to go back it would only be for his customer service."}
{"text":"The family and I stopped by for father's day and I had the best burger experience in my life. I'm originally from California and I consider my self to be a burger connoisseur. I've had them all from in n out to The Hat. Long story short I know a good burger when I eat one. At Red Robin I ordered a Red Robin classic cheese burger with an onion bun, crispy straw onions instead of regular onions, meat cooked well done and also my must have ketchup. After taking my first bite I knew that this was the burger of the year. This burger was perfect in every aspect.  The bun to meat ratio was perfect, the onion bun also gave me a softer more flavourful alternative from your standard sesame seed bun. The crispy straw onions added a nice texture to the burger as it complemented the lettuce, tomatoes, relish, mayo, and ketchup. This Red Robin is taking the crown for best burger of the year in my book. I look forward to getting back to California and trying the same burger to see if quality and taste are comparable. And last but not least I would like to thank my waitress Kayla M. for serving us she is really nice, friendly, and if you get a chance check out this Red Robin."}
{"text":"Good location; decent service and very tasty burgers.  I always dig the free refills on drinks and fries.  Not a bad area either."}
{"text":"Good things about RR.
Their bottomless fries.  Tasty.  And if your don't want ff's you can substitute steamed brocolli, coleslaw, and a couple other things are an even exchange.  They will also substitute sweet potato fries for like $1.50 but it's bottomless too. 
They also have a bottomless root beer float for $3.19 that's made with Barqs. Now you might want to clarify this with the server cuz I think that only the root beer is bottomless, not the ice cream too.
A soda is $2.79!  
Eegad, if that's not a reason to order a cocktail or beer I don't know what is.

I really like the California Chicken burger.  Chicken breast, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, etc.
P oMy son almost always gets a burger.  Funny how that is, I come here to get away from a hamburger.

I think their happy hour is lame to mediocre so I'll steer clear of going here ever again just for that.

Our server, Carol, below par.  We waited to be approached long enough that we had made up our minds about what we're going to order.
When she did come for our drink order we choose to order our entire meal.  I had questions about a menu item and she was not aware or informed.  While placing our order she walked away to attend another table.  I thought that could have waited.  After our meal had been delivered she was apparently done serving our table.  
We had to ask the bartender for a refill on the bottomless items we ordered and when Carol delivered one of the items I asked for a soda refill.
She topped my drink with a different beverage.  Had to wait, again, for her to come by so that could be rectified.  
No \"sorry about that\".

She's just one server here so that shouldn't be a reason to avoid dining here.  It was a reason to lower the number of stars I'll give for my experience.  

Come if you're hungry, like French fries, and a free reign diet."}
{"text":"Had lunch with the family here and love this location.   The food was great, service was excellent and loved the decor.  We usually go to the one at marketplace and have not been there much because of a few issues.   This will definitely be the place we go.  They were wonderful with the kids and not such a bar atmosphere, great family place you can still get a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Well...it was a Friday evening and busy.   We were seated fairly quick.  From there we waited 14 minutes for our server to take our order...that is no good with 2 hungry kids.  Once order was placed food came in a reasonable time.   Food was ok....never got a refill on my drink.  I ate the ice instead.   Our server just never noticed or bothered to care?"}
{"text":"Hmmm it's Sat night however it's 1020pm and service is slow..getting a little ridiculous"}
{"text":"I placed a to-go order to an employee who sounded new over the phone, but oddly I heard no restaurant noise in the background so I couldn't tell if it was a call center or they happened to find the quiet location in the restaurant.  It was fine, although they mixed up my order several times on the phone.  I was told 20 minutes.

My girlfriend went to pickup the order after about 15-20 minutes and they told me they had no order whatsoever.  I called back while my girlfriend was there to inquire about the order was just told, we're really busy.  I could tell that there was difficulty communicating in English so I didn't press it and chalked it up to misunderstanding.

It just took our \"quick pickup\" dinner plan into a 45 minutes to an hour dinner plan which was a big let down.  Very disappointed.  I know they're busy and I can handle delays and wait times, but to just entirely not enter orders and disregard it especially when I take the time to come pick it up is frustrating.

I would just prefer to hear \"I'm busy and won't be entering this order\" which is totally fine, I would just like to make different arrangements for dinner.

*Updated*  After 5-10 minutes they came back and said they had in fact found the order in the system and apologized for the inconvenience.  We still had a delay and additional wait time, but they gave our daughter a free milkshake while they waited for inconvenience.  I appreciated that effort and changed it from 1 star to 3 stars for doing their best to correct it."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Red Robin?

This location is really close to my house, so it's great for those quick dinners when you don't feel like cooking (and lets be honest, that's all the time).

The burgers and chicken tenders (clucks) are usually really good, and the fries are delicious and bottomless. I especially love the A1 Peppercorn Burger and the Buffalo Clucks. Sometimes it can be busy and loud with kids and the service can be slow during those times, but it's always a good place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the last visit with RR and I'm hesitant in returning; especially to this 99th/Mcdwl. Service was a bit rough but to be fair I think our server was given too much on her plate (no help). Things started off good but when the food came; mine was missing the broccoli I usually get instead of fries, and that never came. Never were checked up on until food was finished and when the server finally came back about 15-20 minutes later she said the manager was supposed to come over but they never did. As I was waiting for the check because the kiosk was broken, the booth behind mentioned something about ants; as I looked over my shoulder sure enough there was a trail of ants on the booth and upper area of where we were eating. C'mon!! That table bounced and as I finished paying, I brought the ants to the severs attention and all they did was bring a dirty ass rag over and wiped them away like it was no biggie. All in all because of the totality mess with food and ants, the server said the manager offered dessert (again never came over) but since I was leaving, the dessert was only a \"if you're still gonna stay here and eat it\" deal. No thanks! Bill was paid and a return here is not gonna happen. I've seen previous reviews here in the past questioning the cleanliness about this location and it's very possible they have significant issue."}
{"text":"Love red robin burgers... its my family's spot... so far the service has been great. Cant beat unlimited fries"}
{"text":"Wonderful fast service! Servers were quick and very respectful and knowledgeable of the menus. Polite to boot! Food was delicious and just how I wanted it! Very nice location, still one of my favorite chains!"}
{"text":"Service is great here. Come before noon for lunch on Saturdays to avoid a line. Definitely would come back and recommend for large parties."}
{"text":"The Red Robin in Surprise has been a family go to for a while. We recently made a visit and met THE most awesome waitress-Zabrina. Every time  we have gone in she has been very attentive and just overall fun to have as a waitress. We try to request her each time we dine here. The wait has never been extremely long and the food is always good. It's always on my list as a go to eating spot when I come into town to visit family."}
{"text":"Unlimited fries with campfire sauce, heck yeah I'm there!! Love this place, been here multiple times and nothing has ever gone wrong! Despite being super busy this last Sunday, the service was great! Our server, can't remember his name, (young guy with glasses) was friendly, fast and very attentive. Prices are very reasonable for amazing food! If you're part of the rewards, I think you get free meal for your birthday and also get notified with coupons/deals by email."}
{"text":"Service is always fantastic here. Ordered a Sombrero salad, veganized with a Boca burger, without cheese or dairy dressing, with no hassle. 

The bartender remembered my drink and food order two months after my first visit!"}
{"text":"Red Robin is almost exactly the same wherever you go.  I can count on a decent burger and more fries than I could ever eat.  I really like the whole chain.

This one in particular doesn't stand out from any of the others, except I'd like is to be able to get my burger cooked rare."}
{"text":"Visited today at 2pm, the were not very busy, and we had approximately a 15 minute wait. We noticed when we sat down that they only had two servers in the main dining area. I typically give servers a break knowing that they are short staffed. It took over 10 minutes before they asked for our drink order and we ordered our food at the same time knowing she would not make it back soon.  But once other tables started to receive their food before us, and then our food was delivered cold and incorrect I was fed up. Then when we asked for the check it took another 15 to 20 minutes before we received it. When we received our food there were only 5 other tables that were eating. The hostesses were not helping to clear tables or get drinks. This should be a team effort when you know you are short staffed. We spent 2 hours here mostly waiting."}
{"text":"Sunday and Saturday left much to be desired. 
Both days were to-go orders. This was my cheap alternative to cronuts and they had freebies all week. Each day was something different. 

I emailed the mgmt about the missing drink on Saturday. 
Returned Sunday and the BLTA + cup of chowder, ordered online missed the mark on No tomatoes, no mayo. The Chowder wasn't even a full ladle. Guy working apologized and worked hard to correct everything. 

Walked off without my chowder because they said - everything is ready. But at least they chased me down in the lot to give me the chowder. They corrected it by giving me watered down soup Clam chowder. I'm like everyone knows chowder should be thicker. Alas, the BLTA came back with no tomato no mayo yet barely had any avocado and I was over it. 

The wings were tepid and 2 were just ice box cold. 
Y'all.. I don't know if they have a whole new kitchen, some steady employees were gone for the weekend but I do know I can only recommend getting the cronuts to go. See, I'm holding out hope dine in is just better. Either way, even the Speckled Lemon was bitter and tasted like powder mix. Yuck"}
{"text":"Let me preface with I have never had a Corporate chain type place move so quickly on service. I mean, make your head spin, kind of fast and sincerely. As much as I love Ruth Chris - even they have never proactively read a Yelp review and got into action (well, at least not with me). 

Here's the deal:
1) If you're here ask for NATASHA. She is petite with a really long braid (her hair is super thick). 

She is courtesy, great timing, helpful and impressed me. 

2) The management team can be acknowledged. Although no one caught our issue the day of service and I didn't have time to talk it over while at the restaurant. I will say, \"Color me impressed\" that someone on the team read a Yelp review and got into action. I think it's always commendable to take the review as a way to improve or keep up the good work. 

Well, this update is a KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! 

3) GM Pete called to get info and he wasn't overly apologetic nor did he come off as insincere or with a lot of excuses. Nope he was paced at a good level of apathy and We would like to get it right. I RESPECT THAT. 

In short, you may think of RR as a burger and fry type place that is corporate and standard. But I will admit that, in our experience from Wisconsin to CLT, RR has been anything but. Temp of the food is always just right. The offerings and portions are as expected. I am not a tavern burger fan because the patties just seem to McDonald's-ish thin yet all things considered (a) great service and (b) fries make me a loyalist. 

The drink options (non-ilquor) are always an added bonus from Freckled Lemonade to the new Berry Peach thingy. 

They have an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Food is always really good. One of my favorite places to get a burger. Staff is usually super friendly and on top of it. We go every Friday and they know exactly what we get. So it nice they remember us and make sure everything is good."}
{"text":"Went here for my Birthday. The service was great and fast.

Just a heads up they now have these little kids machines on the table and when you use it to play games or contact your server it will charge a $2.00 fee to your bill."}
{"text":"Went to Red Robin hour before movie.  Sat at Bar just wanted drinks before show!  Bartender was coolest customer ever seen.  I watched young couple short her $40 dollars and run off from bar!  She was upset, but did not loose cool!  She is awesome, excellent customer service!  Cant remember name, but skinny blond!  Good people, she keeps on serving with smile, regardless someone gave her shit sandwich!"}
{"text":"This review is more for pick-up/to go orders than dine in.  I do food delivery and this place does not have it together.  I've been here to pickup TWICE... thinking the first time was just a flake.  They're fairly consistent with their slow service.  First time it took them over an hour to get a simple order (burger and fries).  2nd time thinking it would be different (what was I thinking??)  Same thing..  somehow the order did not even get to the cook when I arrived so yes it took over an hour to get a simple to go order."}
{"text":"Left my card at this ghetto restaurant and realized after I left that the server never returned my card. Called back a couple of minutes later and spoke to a manager about leaving my card and they said it wasn't their. Our server's name was Britney H. We dined in at 3/27/2015. If I knew that they did scketchy things to their customers credit cards I would have never went here!"}
{"text":"I love the location but the serves here is very hit or miss. 

The staff is very unenthusiastic which is disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife and I usually go here and split a burger with the fries and we also have a mini tower of onion rings. I can't think of a time when the service was bad. Food's usually good too although I've gotten a burger with dry buns occasionally. It's better to go during the weekdays as the restaurant's busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"I have been to this Centennial location 5 times in 5 months, but had to go elsewhere 3 times when the wait was over 40 minutes.  

My technique: When I first order, usually for the drink, I tell the server I will have three orders of fries, so start 'em right away.  So, by the time the main dish comes, I'm almost full with fries, and take half the burger home.    I use my George Foreman to recrisp the fries, and get new buns, so it's all good.  

Military discount available.  Parking blows."}
{"text":"Not too bad, but nothing to write home about.

The good: The place was clean, the service was good, the food was just ok.

The bad: The pricing seems quite high for the type of restaurant that they are.  When you go there for a couple burgers, sodas, and an appetizer it shouldn't cost the $$ that it does.  I find specialty restaurants are just as good.

I had the bleu cheese burger, ordered it medium, it came out as ordered.  The taste wasn't wonderful, but it was good.  The onion ring tower is entertaining, but I'm more of a beer battered onion ring fan and will have to remember that next time."}
{"text":"Wow, that was not good. Been a while since we came here, uses to be really good. We called ahead so we were seated quick. Started will pretzel bites which were grease sponges, one bite and sent back. Manager apologized. We each ordered different grommet burgers, haha! I had chili burger, zero flavor, I mean it, no taste. Even their famous fries were gross, try changing the grease once in a while. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Got takeout from this location the other night.  Was craving the Lola burger from B-Spot (cheeseburger with bacon and fried egg on top) so ordered the burger closest to it: the Royal Red Robin.

The steak fries that came with the burger were tasty--seasoned, but not overly salted and still crispy even after the ride home.  Unfortunately, the burger didn't quite match the quality of the fries.  

I asked for my burger to be cooked medium and it came well-done.  The texture of the meat was rather hard and crusty on the outside and rough all the way through--it was hard swallowing and I could feel it going down.  Thanks to overpowering, gratuitous gobs of mayonnaise on both buns, the bread was nearly disintegrated by the time I was halfway through.  Worst of all, the fried egg was well done as well--I was craving the creamy taste of a slightly undercooked fried egg over juicy, medium ground beef and got a rubbery well-done fried egg  over a crusty, hard beef patty instead.  

Overall, for the price (about $10), the burgers and fries were edible but on the overcooked side.  I wasn't expecting B-spot quality, but as a place that totes \"gourmet burgers,\" I anticipated a little more finesse with their meat.  For future quick burger cravings, I might do better picking up a fast food burger and frying an egg over it at home."}
{"text":"Great for families with young kids (very loud which can be really nice when you have a 1 year and 3 year old). The burgers are very good too. Their shkes and ice cream sundaes are not very good. otherwise we love it."}
{"text":"Placed an order online for 2 burgers. 1 Whisky River and 1 Veggie. My husband picked up the order and went out to the car. He then spent a few minutes in the parking lot (this matters to the rest of the situation) organizing the bag because the meals were thrown in haphazardly. When he got home we discovered my burger box said veggie on it (I don't eat meat) but actually contained a bacon cheeseburger. I called the store and asked for the manager since we weren't going today for a replacement and I just wanted a credit back for the food that was going in the trash. Manager agreed to the credit but argued with me about the name of the burger I was given, I asked if what it was mattered what it's called since he's acknowledging it's not the veggie burger I ordered? He then claimed they knew about the error and tried to catch my husband before he left (he was in the parking lot in the curbside spot for a few minutes). They knew they made an error but made no attempt to call the number on the order.

I like Red Robin because their veggie burgers are good and I can sub out a veggie patty on other burgers, but being served food I can't eat makes it unlikely I'll be back."}
{"text":"The waitress had a bad attitude right from the beginning.  Asked me how we got seated.  Like it matters huh?  Ordered our food and asked that my drink be delivered with my meal.  Of course, when almost finished, she brings my drink. As for my burger, In & Out would have been a better choice.  Tried to pay with CASH, boy, that was a problem too.  Seems customer service in this city has gone to Sh*t!  Won't be back.. thats for sure."}
{"text":"WOW, a lot of changes...for the worst! The burgers were terrible! We used to love Red Robin! Now it sucks! There is an apparent shortage of napkins and silverware as well! WTF?!?!?!"}
{"text":"I really love Red Robin!  I haven't lived near one in quite awhile so I was super excited when we stopped by this one for lunch.

Unfortunately there were a few issues.  First off our waitress was too busy so another waitress came over to get us started.  She was actually pretty good.  Unfortunately our real waitress came back.  

As for the food I remember not only the seasoning on the table but also on the fries.  Mine came plain which is sad to me.  I hope that isn't the new way to do things.

Lastly I got the capricie sandwich and I'm pretty sure my tomatoes were not soaked in balsamic, they were plain and ordinary ones.  Would have asked my waitress but she was otherwise occupied."}
{"text":"The husband and I visited in July and if I could give this place no stars I would. Previous to this time the visits have been delightful. 

1. We were there at lunch time and they were not what I would call super busy. We placed our order from a very inattentive waitress. She seemed to have been given too many tables to wait on. All 5 of them. Lol 
2. We sat what felt like forever for our burgers and fries. When a table that was sat a good 15 minutes after us received their food before ours. 
3. Never offered more fries
4. I make better tasting burgers on my backyard BBQ. The meat was just meh...
5. Food arrived cold not even warm. I swear it had been done and forgot to be ran out to us. 
6. A take out box wasn't offered we had to ask for one. 
7. Literally the waitress took our order and brought us a check. She never stopped over to ask if our food was delicious because I had taken 2 bites and was done you I would think she would have wondered if something was wrong. Like say mayonnaise, I am not a fan and asked for it not to be on the burger but it was slathered with it. A food runner brought the food out, another lady cleared and refilled drinks. Waitress was useless, just sayin! 

So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Today the service and food was amazing.  Much better then the last time we went.  Everyone was in the mood for burgers so after visiting Dicks Sporting Goods, it seemed like the right choice (its right next door)  We had the onion rings for the appetizer and it was really good.  Everyone left happy and full.  Will def go back since they got everything together now."}
{"text":"Great service.  This is one of the best experiences I have ever had at a Red Robin.  We were in the mood for burgers and something the kids could eat that was close to where we were at when we were out and about.  I have not had anything else on the menu but this is a great place for burgers.  Check out the pics if you want to see for yourself."}
{"text":"Food: decent.
Atmosphere: good.
Service: eeeeeeeeeeh. Generally its okay I guess.
Price: terrible.

$10 for a veggie burger is asking a little much. I mean, the portions are double what the average person SHOULD eat (next time you're in there: play Spot the Obese People game... they're _everywhere_). Then! When I try to not order my regular pain-in-the-butt Bonzai Burger (with a vegan patty, no cheese and a wheat bun) and get a smoothie and a Garden Salad, it costs me the same thing.

For the same cost I can get a healthier and much better quality meal. I think the only way I'll be back is if my coworkers drag me here."}
{"text":"I'm not that big of a fan of chains. My coworker, on the other hand, is so we decided to grab a (veggie) burger.

The waiter was friendly but not the brightest crayon in the box (we're talking Antique Brass or Timberwolf if you go by Crayola colors..). Here is the conversation we had while he was taking our orders.
Me: \"Uh, yeah. I'll have the Gardenburger without sauce.\"
Him:  \"would you like that medium, medium well or well done?\" 
Me: \"wait, a VEGGIE burger?\" 
then he explains he's new and was told to ask that to everyone for any burger... then I explain that if he asks that for the veggie, chicken, salmon or cod burgers he's gonna get some akward reactions seeing they all have specific temperatures and cook times... Anyhow!

My veggie burger did in fact end up well done! Sorta crunchy and not so pleasant. The fries were a little soggy too.

I've been to Red Robin before so on a \"oh hey, maybe we should go to this place\" I give it a 2 of 5, as for a comparison of other Red Robin locations, I give this a 2.5 out of 5. No care went into the food preparation. That's what I get for going to a chain..."}
{"text":"Our family dined here this past Sunday and had a pretty disappointing experience.  There were 5 of us and each of us had something wrong or missing from our order.  

We were seated fairly quickly, but it took a bit for our server to come over and greet us.  We ordered beverages and by the time our server delivered them we were ready to order.  Food was delivered in an adequate amount of time, but that is the most positive thing I can say about it.  My soup salad combo didn't have the requested piece of garlic toast with it, my sister-in-law had asked for a small side of poutine fries with her kid's burger and was charged for a full size portion, my brother requested refill on his \"bottomless\" sweet potato fries and in the 45 minutes we were there was told multiple times they were \"on the way\" but none were ever delivered to the table, my niece's burger was just so-so and her bottomless fries refill were warm at best. My nephew ordered a chicken entree and it was not delivered with the rest of the food. It was clear by the food delivery person's face that the order had not even been keyed in.  When our waiter realized the error he didn't say sorry, he just said he stole one from someone else's order so it would be out fast (it wasn't, and how does that do anyone any good anyway because now 2 people don't' get their food on time?) and then left our table as quickly as he could.  Another server or maybe the manager (unsure of which because he never introduced himself) came over and said sorry and asked if we needed anything. We made another desperate request for sweet potato fries, but alas, we were again given the \"they are on the way\" spiel but never saw them.  

They did take my nephew's chicken entree off the bill without being asked.  But that was it.  There are plenty of good places in Champaign to get a good burger, so I'm not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"e came in at around 9:45 for a late dinner, the bar was open seating so we took a high top. 2 servers and 2 bartenders in the area, all either talking or wiping down tables as it was pretty empty. All of them watched us sit down and look right at us but no one came over, or offered us menus or drinks for about 20 mins. So we got up and took our business elsewhere, there was also no manager in sight. This was on 2/11/2017"}
{"text":"I know this place is a chain restaurant, but I expect good service, decent food, and and pleasant experience when I go to one. I don't think that is too much to ask. We have 2 kids, so we used to frequent this place. We continued to get shoddy service and had toooonnnss of little annoyances, so we were glad when we found a sports bar/burger restaurant that our kids like even more.

However, my in laws are in town and both my husband and his father were born on the same day, so we had two birthday burgers to use. It so wasn't worth it.

We came in at 4:20 on a Saturday to try to beat the crowds. We were a party of 6, but were told that that the wait would be 30-40 minutes. What!? Ok. They got our name and phone number and we waited, and waited, and waited. I could see a dirty table for 6 empty and waited to be cleared off from the moment we walked in the door. It just sat. 50 ish minutes from the time we got there, I pull out my phone and see a text from Red Robin saying our table is ready from like 8 minutes before. What the heck. We were sitting RIGHT THERE. So I walk the 3 feet to the hostess and ask about it, and she says yes and shows us to our table. You know, the table that had been sitting there empty and dirty the entire time. Strike one and two.

From there on it was little things. Our waiter was really nice, but we kept having to ask for things. Water and drink refills, reminders on sauces, new ketchup since the bottle on the table was empty, etc. The entire table had to share one knife. That sort of thing.

Now the food. My side dish (broccoli) came out about 5 minutes after the rest was served. My burger bun was cold. My husbands entire burger and fries were cold. The meat was over cooked. My sons corn dog bites were so over cooked that they crunched in his mouth. The fries were really under done and all cold. All said and done, this place isn't cheap food, yet they don't care enough to make sure it's cooked properly. Don't even get me started about the POS kiosk they make you use to pay the bill. Try splitting a check and using a gift card with that sucker. It'll add an extra 20 minutes to your night. One more way Red Robin cuts corners to the detriment of their customers.

So, all in all, we decided to never ever return. No matter what. There are waaaay better places to spend your money."}
{"text":"Love the bruschetta  chicken burger!  And Travis,  our server,  was exceptional!  Never an empty glass at the table,  and remembered the extra ranch we ordered. I wish I had this great service every time I went out to eat."}
{"text":"We recently returned to Red Robin after years of going other places.  We are impressed by their diverse menu options and great service.  We ordered the Skinny Margaritas, Pretzel Bites, Chips/Guac/Salsa, Tower of Rings (Onion Rings), and two desserts - the chocolate brownie sticks and the donuts.  Everything was wonderful...  They have a fantastic appetizer menu with $5, $7, $9 options.  We love the easy way of reviewing your bill with the screens on table as well as the easy check out/pay option.  We will return!"}
{"text":"First time we came here, we loveeed it! We couldn't wait to return.  We returned about a month later and hoped it wouls be just as delicious. Unfortunately,  it wasn't the same.My burger was over the top greasy, and so was my husband's.  
They are usually busy, so there was a wait time of twenty to thirty minutes both times."}
{"text":"If I ever want to pick from a huge selection of burgers. Red Robin is the place to go."}
{"text":"Totally underwhelmed...  Took forever to even get a host at the door to seat us... And then we waited about ten minutes to get drink orders. One of our drinks came out in a nasty dirty glass that had baked on ketchup stuck to it. What else isn't getting washed?

Also, burgers came out overcooked. 

This is really disappointing, because we love this place so much. I don't think we're going to be back for a while... And it isn't the fault of the wait staff; they looked exhausted. Every. Last. One."}
{"text":"Can I rate this place lower than one star?  Alissa was our waitress, and was more concerned about talking to other wait staff at the server's station than giving us things like napkins (that we asked for three times). 

Also, don't expect to get a burger cooked any way other than \"a little bit pink.\" Four different burgers with two different requests, and all four got put in the same way. 

And I would just like to pose a question: how do you eat a side of coleslaw with no silverware on the table. Two runners and a waitress couldn't be bothered to bring me a fork. 

I guess my biggest gripe here is not having people use common sense (wipe down the table, put down napkins/silverware, etc.) and maybe listening to customers. I don't know how many times we asked for the same things."}
{"text":"Red Robin is my absolute FAVORITE place to go if I don't want to spend too much, but don't want to eat fast food. I'm going to compare Red Robin's Big Tavern burgers (regular sized burger)/Double Tavern burgers (two kid patties instead of one normal patty) to McDonald's meals to show that Red Robin is actually cheaper. On average, the BT burgers are priced at $8.99 while the DT burgers are priced at $6.99. Now this is including unlimited fries and unlimited normal sauce (as in not the special ones so ketchup or ranch, etc.). A McDonald's Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal is $7.43, but that's not including sauce because they charge for sauce now. So if you were to dine at Red Robin, you'd not only get a delicious burger, but also great service, unlimited sauce, and unlimited fries for $8.99/$6.99. If you were to eat at McDonald's, you'd get no service, an okay burger, limited amount of fries, and you'd have to pay for sauce every single time. So Red Robin is actually cheaper especially if you eat a lot of fries or like to have a lot of sauce. They added a new burger to the Tavern menu and it's basically a baked potato burger (includes bacon, fries, chive sour cream sauce, etc. all in the burger) and it's definitely my new favorite. You can't beat the flavor and the price. Seriously I'm amazed at how cheap the burger is for how great it tastes. Now as for the restaurant itself, it's clean and comfortable. The host always greets, the servers are attentive, and everyone is nice, but it's the nice as in they have to because it's their job. It's not genuine. Basically the staff is like any other normal place, but they weren't amazing enough to leave an impression until my boyfriend and I had Britni as our server. She was the only one who ever left an impression on us out of all the times we've dined at this location. She did such a phenomenal job and was really on it even though they were short staffed. We came Tuesday morning after the NAB convention and got seated. It took her a while to get to us, but she did stop by saying that she'll be right with us as soon as possible because they're short staffed. That was one of the good things she did because she communicated with us. She did look like she was very busy due to being short staffed, but she NEVER once forgot to check up on us, give us more fresh fries, fill up our drinks so many times without us even asking, and she was actually genuinely kind! You can definitely hear it in her voice and see it in her facial expressions that she was being kind like you were one of her friends. There's a clear difference between someone who is just being nice and someone who is genuinely wanting to know how you're doing or how your meal was and you can see this in Britni. I'll obviously come back as I have before so many times, but this time I'll be asking for Britni more often! Highly recommend requesting her as your server!"}
{"text":"Had gotten a burger from there and it was cold when food came around. But went about a year later and got a salad and it was good. Still very sceptical though. Waitress was great and very nice."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and haven't  had a bad time or bad food. This time we came in on a Monday night and got Hannah as our server. She was great, allowed us to have our meal but always knew when to be around. I got the new southern charm burger,  it came out really good and i got a sweet thai pepper sauce to go with my fries and that sauce is amazing. Girlfriend  got the whiskey river  bbq burger and said it came out great as usual.  The donut stack was really good as well."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love red robin, typical dinner date for us. We usually go to the happy valley location and never feel the need to complain.

We attended this location last night and it was the 2nd time in a row we walked up to the hostess stand and all hostesses had there backs toward us gossiping, my fiancé had to interrupt them to get there attention and seat us. 
The first thing a customer does is walk threw the doors and be greeted, and if that cant be done right the rest of the experience will be negative. 
So uncomfortable feeling like we were interrupting there chat session.
After we sat down and ordered we watched our onion rings, along with the tables behind us, and another short stack sit under the heat lamp for a honest 15 minutes.
After being under the heat lamp for so long there were finally brought to our tables. 
Cant speak for the table behind us but they received their appetizer 1 minute before there entrée. Which I would have complained on right then and there. Our appetizers were under the heat lamps for way too long for people not to recognize to run them to their tables so we could have enjoyed our apps in a timely manner. 

My fiancé and I were not pleased AT ALL.
The only reason this review has 4 stars is because our sever was a SUPERSTAR.
His name was Kyle and he made the entire experience 10 times better for us. Always quick on drinks, fries, and great personality.

Because of our server we will return one last time and see if our experience improves."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  My girlfriend and I went in to the bar area on a sunday they where not very busy and we sat down to place a to go order.  After about 15 min of no one saying anything to us and being passed over for those of a color not of our own we decided to leave.  I love red robin but this visit has just left me with a sick feeling."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch today.  And it will be our last time at this Red Robin.  The waitress was not the best, and they charged extra pricing for his cheesebuger that was already on the menu. Then getting out of the booth the seat popped up and hit his back as he fell to floor. The customers around tried to get the attention of wait staff and management but ignored them. When I came back from the bathroom, we had to find someone. The waitress was extremely rude and the management pretty much accused us or made us to be lyers. He hurt his and knee and they DIDN'T give a shit."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars. The food was good but wait staff was serving dirty dishes next to new food. When telling the manager he said they clean then wash there hands then serve food. But how could that be when the only sink is in the bathroom. This is just gross!"}
{"text":"This place is to burgers what California Pizza Kitchen is to pizza. If you can put it on a burger they have done it. The big bonus is bottomless french fries. Join their loyalty program called Red Rewards, and get a free burger on your birthday! You will also get other offers, I just got a free milkshake (I got the Caramel and Salt, Very Good). They also have a full bar for those of you who want something a little stronger than a milkshake. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"The staff not to bright can't even het a side plate after two tries bottomless fries what a load of crap you order them but they never arrive. Dismal"}
{"text":"I have been here three times in the last 3 months with my family. It's a kid friendly place, noisy so you don't feel that you are disturbing others. 
All three visits the service has been extremely slow. Don't tell me you are going to bring fries for the kids before the meal and then forget to bring them. Our severs have always failed to check back to see if we need more drinks/beer. This last visit was the final team when my food was served complexity cold. When I told the manager there was no offer to take it off my bill or make it right. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers! EXCELLENT service!! Drinks were there before we finished them. Atmosphere was nice. Fries were great--unlimited too! Go there! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh boy under cooked chicken on my avo-cobb this is a problem.  Wasn't happy, but I was half way through my salad and decided not to return it, but did inform the manager to let the kitchen staff know to check the food before sending it to the customer.

I could have been seriously food poisoned and the health inspector would have to come in and then a doctor's bill and them media coverage and then...you get the point.

I still had to post this to warn others to check their meals."}
{"text":"This place, ughhh. I went to get a burger because they have a gluten-free fryer plus a gluten-free bun that is reasonably tasty when warmed. They did not (warm or toast) the bun. Let me get to my major complaint, the definition of Medium. My burger was crispy and dry. When I sent it back, it came back crispy and dry and cut in half and cold. I think they are brown/red color blind. For $14, I expect much much more. The fries were limp, as if the fry oil wasn't up to temp before they dropped. Everyone can have an off day however this is the second time with the same complaints. The server was more attentive the last time I was there. Overall, a terrible experience! I am Celiac (with other severe food allergies) so the places I can go and actually expect to eat more than a salad are kinda limited. So this was doubly disappointing. Sucks!"}
{"text":"I love this place and have been going for years with my family and by myself. Today I ordered a beer and a burger and saw order after order go out that's to go with endless fries... they asked and in 90 seconds they have fries..  are fries that expensive 

I asked if I could have some and they said wait for your food. I paid for my burger and drink and left... I'm never going back... I was the only person at the bar??? If it was busy I understand 
I never got my food and left half a beer....."}
{"text":"Fact: The phrase \"Gourmet Burgers\" is in the name of this place.
Fact: They refuse to cook a burger rare or medium rare.
Opinion: That is (or at least should be) an actionable level of false advertising.
Opinion: Nothing else was that good either.

The menu does look delicious with lots of options.  But to quote a former President of the United States, \"fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again.\""}
{"text":"Very disappointed considering that family told me \"You have to try there burgers\".  They are ok, but nothing special.  Was really disappointed with the zuchinni for appitizer as there were only like 5 small pieces.  Over priced place and probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I went to this Red Robin after receiving a gift card for a terrible experience that I had at a different location. Big surprise.. I visited this Red Robin and had a crappy experience.. so I give up! My husband and I ordered two appetizers and one dessert to spend our gift card. We got our 'double berry cheesecake' with no actual berries (it was supposed to come with strawberries and a berry sauce). It came with the berry sauce, which was like a watered down strawberry jam, but no strawberries. Then we also ordered these chips covered in pulled pork and cheese and red onions... and it came straight from the microwave. It had been microwaved so long that it was impossible to pull the chips apart and the cheese was not melty anymore. It was more like a rock. Not to mention, it didn't even come with the onions it mentions in the description and shows in the photo. When I asked the very busy bartender if she could send it back and request that it not be microwaved, she said that they microwave it to get the cheese to melt, instead of obliging and apologizing. When I told her that the description did not say that it was microwaved and that I would like it to not be microwaved, she again did not apologize but instead gave me an attitude and wandered off with the returned food. After this experience, my husband and I will definitely not be returning to Red Robin. Between the bad attitudes and the seriously crappy food... it's not worth another try."}
{"text":"I visited Red Robin with my husband and daughter to try out some of their new burgers. When we walked in, the restaurant smelled like something rotting. The waitress that sat us was wearing a pair of see-through leggings as pants. I could see her underwear. We sat, and to accompany the awful smell, was a layer of grime on the booth, the walls, the table... it was disgusting. There were crumbs squished into the crevices of the booth as if it had never been properly cleaned. Then, against my better judgement because my daughter was really hungry, we ordered. My daughter's burger came with tomato on it, despite the fact that she ordered the burger without them (she is allergic) and my husband's burger was not fully cooked (cold in the middle) with stale buns for all of us. The buns actually fell apart to the touch. We ended up eating a buttload of bottomless fries and going somewhere else for a proper meal. It was disgusting to say the least."}
{"text":"Only reason I gave this 3 star rating is because the bottom of the hamburger bun was soaked. Other than that, it was a good burger. Onion rings were above average,"}
{"text":"Shoutout to Brandon the manager for going above and beyond for our very excited four year old. After two successful weeks of school, she picked Red Robin to celebrate. There was a bit of a wait, but she went right up to him and stated that she would be having a cheeseburger, fries, and ketchup. When we got seated, he came to our table with exactly that. He had ordered it so she would eat right away! Awesome!!! He made sure she was taken care of. Jason, our waiter continued this exceptional customer service throughout our evening. Thanks fellas!"}
{"text":"My only complaint is that the server kept reaching in front of my daughter, who was in a highchair, to hand my husband his plate and other things. I don't appreciate a plate of hot food being waved in front of my 2 year olds face. I was waiting for the moment for her to either drop something or hit my daughter on her head bc she was too lazy to walk around the table to him- it wouldn't have been a far walk, we were seated in mini booth."}
{"text":"Well...I just paid a little over $27 for two sandwiches that just may have been the worst burgers I've ever had in my 32 years.  After seeing the promo pictures for the \"Big Bacon Burger\" I figured I was in for a delicious meal!  Perhaps it is just me, but when I spend $10 for a low quality beef, burger and only taste BBQ sauce, I'm left a bit one on the unhappy side.  I could have spent 1/10 of the money and been more satisfied at McDonald's.  I'm not sure I have to mention the annoying service you get, but unless your nation CHAIN has just opened, you don't need to ask if I have ever dinned here before.  I think I can figure out how a lazy, uninspired burger joint works on my own."}
{"text":"Awesome food and quick service. Manager stopped by randomly to make sure things were good. Only complaint is that you need to ask for fries if you want them before your meal"}
{"text":"We had a very good lunch experience today. The restaurant was not busy at all and this allowed our server to be attentive and our food to be served rather quick.
   We had a rather large lunch. We started with the chips served with guac and salsa. The salsa was on the spicy side, which I'd prefer. The guac was good. Not too bland and not too salty. 
   We had 4 entrees. The bacon cheese burger, with two pieces of large thick bacon and American cheese. The crispy chx tender salad, served with egg, bacon, cheese and tomato. The salad was a modest size, but tasty. The whiskey river BBQ chx wrap, with lettuce tomato. The whiskey sauce was sweet with a little bit of a pepper taste. It was a big wrap and very yummy. The kids order of corn dog bite was plentiful, with 5 pieces of the dogs and a cup of fruit for our choice of side. The refill of fries was generous. 
    For desert, we chose two. The mountain high mudd pie was huge! It was a giant piece of ice cream cake with the top layer of chocolate ice cream and a cookie crum middle with the bottom layer of ice cream as cookies and cream. The crust was a chocolate cookie crust. It was topped with a generous amount of whipped cream with a chocolate and caramel drizzle! Yum! The second was the gooey chocolate brownie cake. The cake was topped with a warm chocolate syrup and a side of vanilla ice cream with strawberries supposed to have been on top, but my kid wanted it on the side. 
    The experience was great. I feel very satisfied with the service and food and my tummy is happy!"}
{"text":"My friend had her birthday dinner here.  She was told they would not do reservations at all and that she'd have to show up early,  and hope for the best.  When she arrived,  she was told that was not the case,  and that they do offer reservations. She was an hour early to her own birthday dinner... Seems like if you answered the phone and were asked a question you don't know the answer to  you should ask, right? 

Our server was great.  There were a LOT of us  and she kept us all straight and kept the drinks coming well.  We all really liked her.  But the poor girl had to really scramble when the food came out because the kitchen got about a third of the orders wrong.  She worked hard to keep the lot of us happy though. Even though the kitchen ran out of fries...  And then out of sweet potato fries... 

Our server was the redeeming factor for sure."}
{"text":"Don't eat here if you are black.. I get very rude service and I will never come back and eat here again.. They left me and my 2 year old son waiting in the front and walked by us numerous times until I had to ask to be seated while I seen them greet everybody..(n"}
{"text":"Yes the revocations are nice but the service was awful! The hostesses were mindless & couldn't figure out where to seat us even though there were plenty of open tables. My burger was room temperature at best. Our waitress served me water in a dirty glass. She never checked on our table & we had to flag her down a few times to get refills as well as the check. She also said they don't do military discount which I know isn't true since I have eaten at other RR who have the discount."}
{"text":"Not TOO shabby. The staff does seem to be a bit immature, but of course that is just my own objective opinion. The bottomless fries are a nice treat, but really?? I can't expect the server to deliver bottomless fries on demand all the time which gets frustrating. The burgers are pretty good in my opinion, as are the shakes. It's a hit or miss for me at this place. I honestly would simply prefer Smashburger to Red Robin. I think I only go here when I receive a gift card or company really would like to go. Dang, I hate leaving reviews like this, but yep, that's my opinion."}
{"text":"Every once in awhile I let my husband choose where to eat and chains are his jam. This chain makes for an okay meal option.

The restaurant was packed for lunch on Saturday so we sat in the bar area which didn't have a wait. The service was good with multiple servers checking on us and making sure we had everything we needed. The food did take a little longer to arrive than I expected, but they were busy. My husband really enjoyed his burger. I enjoyed that I could substitute grilled chicken in one of the burger options. Since it is a chain it's so easy to Google the menu options and quickly get calorie counts. This made is much easier to make a somewhat smart choice for lunch. The food isn't too bad, service is good, and it's an economical choice."}
{"text":"We have been to this location several times and had great food. The fries are SUPER yum and my daughter loves the atmosphere. HOWEVER, the first time we visited this location, the waitress mysteriously LOST my credit card and I was ask to leave my phone number, that they would call me when it was found. The second time we visited our waitress could have cared less that we were sitting there. We waited 15 minutes for her to come to the table to get our drink order. :/ The food here is great, but the service SUCKS."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a birthday!! 
The service was bad grant it we had a large party, so I expected mediocre service!!!
What I didn't expect is for the server to have no idea about the product like me having a coupon, I was unable to use which was fine but she couldn't tell me why!! After seeing the fine print I was ok with that!!!
Then I check my BOA balance and she swiped my card twice & comped the wrong burger!!!
Manager walking around in street clothes, not once did the server or any manager come to the table and say thank you!!! It was about 30 people average ticket of $15. We had to send food back that was simply ordered, no one special ordered to keep the orders simple!!
I also thought it was illegal in NC to add the auto gratuity to a ticket!!!
Oh well no more Red Robin for me!!"}
{"text":"We were super excited to have a Red Robin open near us. Unfortunately, after THREE visits, we've had the same service. The beginning is always good, we end up hopeful it will be a good dining experience this time. The first problem, the bottomless fries aren't very bottomless when you don't get them. OR you have to ask for them multiple times only to get them with your food instead of before your food. Apparently to go boxes are also nonexistent (maybe they are somewhere with the fries, hanging out together). Every time we have gotten our food, the server vanishes. This is where we have to hunt down a box on our own. I was fine with paying on the kiosk, but the server put the ticket under the wrong table leaving us to sit there 15 minutes waiting for the 'pay' option to highlight. Finally fed up, asked another server to see where our bill got lost to (maybe it's with the To go box and the 'bottomless' fries). It's a shame, the food is good and the cost is decent, but if the service can't be somewhat reasonable, we can't handle the frustration caused by dining at this location."}
{"text":"I saw 3 different food runners attempt to deliver food to the wrong tables just at bar. And in the last 3 times we've been here the bar has been absolutely FREEZING. 2 separate couples went out to their cars after the fact to grab coats. If you come bring a jacket."}
{"text":"I used to like RR but after trying it recently, it just doesn't seem as good. Had the holiday turkey burger and the patty was pretty awful. The turkey meat was that overly soft processed type meat. For over $10, I didn't think it was worth it Fatburger's turkey burger is cheaper and much more worth it. Bf prefers the $6 burger at Flemings at happy hour. I'd probably rate the food a 2 star but I know RR has such good customer service so hence the extra star."}
{"text":"Oh Avondale... It was a pleasure to visit this side of town. I had a nice big salad which was a typical Applebee's type of quality and service. 
I should have had a burger. They seemed like they got more attention in the back (my friend had one). 
Back to the salad... Nothing to write home about, very average. Same for the service here."}
{"text":"Granddaughter wanted to go to Red Robin for lunch because well FREE refills on Root Beer Floats and french fries!! So heck yeah, lets go!!!! 

As soon as we were seated waitress came over asked how we were and would we like to order our drinks. Granddaughter pipes up Root Beer Float please, I asked for water and a kids menu. Placed our order for food. It was good... no complaints about the food.

All orders were placed by the waitress, from our table, on this tablet thing.

After eating the waitress asked if we wanted anything else.. nope, just the bill. She takes this tablet thing enters some stuff and turns it towards me so that I can \"view\" my bill.

 The endless Root Beer float was priced at $4.99 not $1.99 per the kid menu... waitress stated my granddaughter ordered from the \"Adult Menu\" ... no she didn't.. she hadn't looked at any menu when she ordered her drink.. waitress did correct this oversight.

NOW.. for the BIG ONE... remember I said I \"viewed\" my bill.  Imagine my surprise when I see a $1.99 \"entertainment fee\"!! They seriously charge you $1.99 for the privilege of letting your child play games on the SAME tablet that the waitress uses to order food / drinks and for \"viewing\" your bill. There is a small disclaimer on the device screen that states there will be $1.99 \"entertainment fee\" but ONLY on the screen itself. No markings on the casing of this devices. 

What upsets me about this $1.99 \"entertainment fee\" is that this tablet is not used for the sole purpose of \"entertainment\". This tablet is a tool that the waitstaff uses to make their job a heck of a lot easier. Everything is done with this tablet. No more walking around to various parts of the restaurant to place orders, etc. 

If you want to charge me $1.99 for \"entertainment\" do not use my \"entertainment\" device for  your job!!"}
{"text":"It had been a few years since I was here due to the fact that for my last visit, I ordered a turkey burger and received what appeared to be a grilled frozen patty, disappointing and unappetizing. I gave it another chance, at my kids' request. It has improved significantly. I ordered the NachOMGs. The chips were nice and crispy; everything was fresh, except the chili because, of course, it was cooked. There were only a few pieces of meat, but they were on the large size--I cut each one in half. The chili itself was not memorable, but the nachos overall were great! My son said his mandarin oranges had seeds in them, but the chicken he ate was very good. My daughter ate up her mandarin oranges and is still working on her mini corn dogs, so I would say, she's enjoying her food. The server was very friendly and kindly answered the kids' questions. Service is everything in my book. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Poor, poor service. No hostess for at least 5 minutes. Then get to a dirty bar to he told to wait another\"5\" minutes."}
{"text":"Fast service, tavern burger is a great deal on Tuesday along with happy hour 'till six....why not?!"}
{"text":"Long wait for seating and ordering and receipt of food.no wifi to force people to pay to play app games at little tablets at tables. Food is over priced , for example a 14.99 chicken sandwich or an  8.99 thick burger. Only redeeming quality is bottomless fries , also drinks as in beer cost as much as a six pack for one drink."}
{"text":"So.. Ordered takeout.. Got home to wrong order.. An inconvenience, but we go back to get our actual order.. 45 minutes late, we get home with our order... and it's screwed up....  I like red robin.. This one seems to have some issues.. Have experienced some issues while eating in as well.. Only gave them another chance because I got a gift card for Christmas....won't be back..."}
{"text":"Came here last night & didn't have a bad experience like the rest of these yelpers. My roommate & I were craving a burger, and that's what we got. My Bonzai burger was pretty good & she seemed to like her Red Robin burger. The fries were great. Can't complain about bottomless fries :) The sauces were pretty good & our waiter Andres was super. 
I left my keys & they luckily found them & kept them until I retrieved them today :)"}
{"text":"My family and I had what was, hands-down, the absolute worst restaurant experience we have ever had at this Red Robin location. It's been nearly a month since our visit and it's taken me this long to be able to write a constructive review that wouldn't be doused in anger toward them. 

We showed up at a party of 10... 8 adults and 2 small children. We were seated and greeted by our waitress who immediately seemed miserable. She didn't even try to be friendly. We started the visit off with most of us receiving the wrong beverage. Once that was worked out, we placed our orders. The kids both got cheese pizzas, and the adults ordered various burgers and chicken tenders. We waiting an obnoxiously long time for our food, although the restaurant wasn't busy. That's aside, once the food arrived, the runner started auctioning off our food by holding in front my brother's face and shouting \"Who had...\" and aggressively enough that my brother had to duck and pull away from his seat. His face implied he was just as confused by the runners lack of self awareness as the rest of us were. 

Then the manager (Shaun, who I believe is the General Manager) arrived with two pizzas for the kids. Both had been made with pepperoni. Now anyone who has been to dinner with small children knows that if a kid ordered and wants CHEESE pizza, then pepperoni ain't gonna cut it. They wont touch it. But when we brought to the managers that it was suppose to be cheese pizza, he replied with frustration and asked if could \"just pick off the pepperoni\" and then became even more annoyed when we said no. 

After that whole debacle, the kids got their cheese pizzas and everyone was eating except me. My food never arrived. And though I had brought this to the attention of BOTH managers who visited the table, nearly everyone was finished eating before Shaun finally returned to tell me that my food was never rang in and that it would be out shortly. I kindly asked him to bag it up to-go since everyone else was nearly finished eating. 

I must note that after our order was taken, we never saw our server until we were ready to pay. The only people at our table in between those times were two very incompetent managers. We needed extra napkins, refills on our drinks, and many other things throughout the evening and no one offered to get them or even responded when we asked for them. 

To boot, once I told the manager I would not be paying for my burger (because why would I at this point, honestly?) he became argumentative and told us that our server had low blood sugar and used that as an excuse for our terrible experience. He had about 10 baskets of fries sent to the table even though we were ready to leave, and I think this was a sad and pathetic attempt to please us. He did eventually comp my burger, but we never actually received a sincere apology for our experience, only excuses and poor attitudes from every employee involved. 

So, needless to say, we won't return to this location again. And I hope for the sake of that store, Red Robin finds a new managing team because that place is a total shit show."}
{"text":"On a road trip and stopped for grub, shout out to Matt and Cassie for making our visit amazing!"}
{"text":"We went to Red Robin tonight for a birthday celebration and had a great time.  Everyone wanted hamburgers and fries  and as I am on a diet I was happy to see that they had several options available for me.  The staff was friendly, on the ball, and even brought out a FREE cute \"Birthday Sundae\" for the birthday girl... who turned 25. Great place for a low key, relaxed dinner with several price point options."}
{"text":"What a difference location makes. Notice this Red Robin has a higher rating than the others. They are flexible with menu changes or substituions (which I often ask for). The food is tasty, portions gererous, servers friendly & the prices reasonable. It's kid friendly, so for my tastes it's a bit noisy, but that's alright. They are worth driving out of your way for."}
{"text":"This particular location has SERIOUS issues.  Food is good (Red Robin food).  Servers lose their minds if you ask for anything out of the norm like \"do you mind if we sit somewhere that's not RIGHT NEXT TO THE KITCHEN?  Maybe in one of these 20 open booths throughout the restaurant?\"  Music is too loud, manager was actually on point and I was really impressed until I watched him and one of the servers set up a table for themselves in the middle of the dining area with full blown table cloth, gloves and several bags of \"hot and juicy crawfish\" from their competitor next door.  Indulging in their food while the rest of the servers gossip behind the counter. Can't make this stuff up.  Totally unprofessional in my opinion as I look around at the crayon all over the walls, garbage all over the ground, restrooms destroyed and tables from said server are completely filthy with dishes left from the last customer.  We've been burned at this same location twice before but thought we'd give it another go.  NOPE.  This place is garbage.  Head down the road to the galleria mall location if you want to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Was here with my wife and son today. Never been to a Red Robin before so this was a treat. Food was pretty decent and staff was nice. They had the air conditioner blasting so was not very comfortable. But we live in Arizona so that is a common occurance."}
{"text":"Was contacted by the manager, Daren after my initial experience.  He very nicely encouraged me to give them another try.  I was more than pleased with my burger and fries I had this time!  I had so much food, I almost needed a nap after eating.  The staff was all very friendly while I waited for my to go order.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, red robin is my kids favorite restaurant.  I'm not sure why, but we still frequent it often despite my best efforts.  I have officially learned my lesson and will not be ordering chicken again.  I love both their bruschetta chicken and teriyaki chicken sandwiches but I cannot get over the rubber chicken texture, and the yummy sandwich flavors masking the actual chicken flavor isn't cutting it for me anymore.  This last time I ordered the Caesar chicken wrap and again, the chicken is so gross!  Not to mention the wrap itself was dry and tasteless.  
I love their fries.  Like seriously I am in love with their fries.  And we always have great service at this location.  I just wish they would change the chicken!  It tastes like fast food chicken (NOT GOOD).
From now on I'll just order fries!!"}
{"text":"Food is average at best and its really pricey. im ok with over priced food as long as service is really good, Red Robin isn't, or the restaurant is in an area like Town Square. When it comes to hamburgers I dont know how I get suckered into eating anything in Vegas when In N Out burger is always awesome."}
{"text":"Been there twice now (many years apart) - both times I felt like it was a waste of money.  Staff was disorganized, slow and only \"just friendly enough\".  Quality was mediocre - I expected better for a sit-down.  We have 4 kids, 17-11 and none were impressed.  My 14 year old son wouldn't even eat the chicken fingers (which he always loves at other places or at home) he ordered - they were pretty nasty.  None of the kids want to come back - and kids want to go out whenever possible! (has no bearing on my wife's cooking - she's great)"}
{"text":"Came here for my free birthday burger! Free food is always great. Was greeted right as i walked in. I took a seat in the lounge/bar area as it was relatively empty. My server came within a few minutes to take my drink order and food order. I orders the California Chicken with bottomless fries. Asked for an order of fries to start of with and it took about 5 mins to come out, fries came out hot and fresh. Food came out shortly after, less than 10 minutes since ordering. As I took my first bite, I noticed there was no guacamole. I told my server and she brought me a side no questions asked. The sandwich was good. The service was good."}
{"text":"Red Robin is not a place we \"crave\", or think about going to often...just kind of end up there. Every time I've been to this location I'm reminded of why. The food is consistently ok, not great/not horrible = pretty good. Lots of gimmicks, pay at the table kiosk, endless/bottomless one thing or another. 
We were there at least an hour prior to closing on a Monday night. You would have thought they'd been closed for an hour. There were still people there, but all the servers were busy doing side work/trying to get out of there. We felt rushed even prior to closing. Service was adequate; not overly friendly. I'll be back, just not very soon."}
{"text":"When i was there on june 12rh just a few days ago. After i walked around outside in temps above 114 degrees for 45 minutes ttrying to find them, when i finally did they asked me when i came in what can we help u with?? Well i said it is dinner time i would be here to get food duh??? . that was not the way to greet a paying customer that was gonna spend 15 dollars on their tiny little burger and fries. Then when i asked what was taking so long for my server to bring me a menu?? A manager with blonde hair came over and said u need to leave. And if u come back here i will have u arrested. I was 86ed from there. But for what??? They were the ones being rude, slow, and unprofessional."}
{"text":"3 out of 5 burgers were cooked wrong but the staff handled it really well. Would have been nice to eat together though."}
{"text":"The service was super slow and the waitress was not attentive or even polite. The food was not good. Had steamed broccoli as a side and every piece was brown. The burger was overcooked and had a weird taste. Every aspect of our experience here was terrible. We won't be going back. It is a shame, because we have been to other Red Robin locations in the past, and they were always excellent. Not sure why this one is so bad."}
{"text":"I did a check in about how there were honestly 40 High School kids in the lobby/parking lot and we actually got a table for two right away.  
We came in and nearly turned around in fear with seeing all those kids, but braved enough to ask to hostess who despite the screaming and jumping around of 40 16 year olds still had a smile on her face.

I LOVE their fries with a passion and every few months will crave them, I rarely do burgers so when I do them - they better be good.  I generally order the Royal Red Robin Burger because the egg can be so tasty!  This last time, the burger started out delicious, but once it started to cool down - the American Cheese congealed into something not so tasty and attractive looking and made the burger inedible half way through. I think I will order something different next time without American Cheese.  My boyfriends burger was good all the way through though. 

Our food came SUPER fast and our waitress was very nice and attentive.  The location isn't near us, but we make a trip down there every so often so I can get a Very Berry Limeade and Fries!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken tortilla soup and deep fried zucchini. They slice their own zucchini and use their own batter... delicious!!! The soup was really good too!! My husband had a salad, burger and fries."}
{"text":"I worked for Red Robin 20 years ago, and I still like to go there! That says something! This restaurant is great always consistent!"}
{"text":"Filthy & horrible management. Used to be a regular here and came here on New Years Day to be severely disappointed. Dirty silverware & dirty table bussing. Ordered our usual burgers and first came out ice cold. Had them remake food and still warm after observing numerous servers ignore standing food orders allowing it to get cold. We informed the manager \"Ryan\" and he just smiled with a condescending attitude. He waited for us to request an adjustment to be made instead of offering. This place obviously needs new management and a health inspection."}
{"text":"We have not received our food yet but the beer is ice cold and the bartender, Don, is awesome. Great attitude very helpful and makes us feel like we're #1 and like we're his only customers even with a packed bar. I will be back."}
{"text":"We've been there 3 times over the last 6 months, reasons that we haven't gone more times is because of the service that under shines the food. In a nutshell, the service that probably starts with the management really is that bad. We have been moved from one table to another because of a shift change? We always have to waive a server down (even when it's not ours) to get refills on fries and drinks on all occasions! Our last server even said the dreaded \"no\" on the combo meals as far as substitutions instead of saying the proper \"I'll see what I can do\" or \"it'll be this much more\". Server and cooks in the back even made jokes about being \"out\" of fries comments loud enough for us to hear, then later coming out saying it'll be out in few minutes (about 10 mins) with a \"smirk\" on his face. They need a makeover in management or this place will be getting more bad reviews. The 2 stars are for the food being good but -4 stars for all 3 times dining in."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We sat for almost 10 minutes before we saw a server. We hit the call button on the ziosk and still waited for a server for 5 minutes. Sever herself was fine, but the hostess was rude and the manager was a coward."}
{"text":"Not only is this location great with kids, the food is pretty darn good.  They were a little off tonight.  Speed of service was slow and they even ran out of fries at one point.  However, that is not going to keep us from returning.  Always consistent.  We like how our kids can be themselves and no one gets offended or gives you that bitter looking Kermit the Frog look cause the kids are acting up.  The staff here has a lot of patience.  Very commendable!"}
{"text":"The funny thing when I go there I don't go for the burgers I go for the Fish and Chips!  Really great fish and all you can eat chips!
Love it!"}
{"text":"The service at this establishment is terrible. My mom and I went here earlier today, and there were 3 greeters who just sat there chit-chatting. Keep in mind there was not a line nor was it busy. They didn't even bother to look at us and they weren't professional. I had to literally say loudly, WE NEED A BOOTH NOT A BAR TABLE. Our server was slow and awkward. When we asked for our ticket and dessert it took the server 20 minutes and we didn't even get our dessert for which we were charged for. We wanted to leave and so we went up to register and asked another employee to ring us out. She was the most rude person in that place. She told us: \"Well, your server has to take care of that\" and they left us dangling there for 10 minutes. The woman at the register would not help us but kept adding her 2 cents in. They did remove the charge for dessert we did not get, and the manager didn't even bother to see us. This is by far one of most terrible places I have been to and I will not come back.  So, my rate for this Red Robin is 2 out of 10."}
{"text":"Menu with a ton of different burgers?  Yes, please!  Unfortunately for Red Robin, it's a chain... so you can get your burger from one state to the next.  The university location seems to be fairly slow (not busy) but our server was nice enough.  We were there during peak lunch time and it was barely full.  I guess it's hard to get away from this place without dropping $12-15 dollars for lunch.  Granted it's a pretty hearty meal, but a bit expensive for lunch.

The dining room is kept clean and there is plenty of nick-knacks on the walls to look at to kill the time.

One thing that they have going for them is their \"special\" Red Robin seasoning, which unfortunately on my last trip was a bit solidified in the container which leads me to believe how long it has been sitting there or how NOT often they refill or keep that seasoning at it's best.  Mostly salt, but still.

If you are looking for a quick lunch... I wouldn't recommend this place since it was pretty relaxed.  I could see myself getting easily annoyed if I was trying to get somewhere since our server seemed to have fair command over the section, but it felt like the getting the checks took forever."}
{"text":"I've been to this Red Robin a few times but want to give a review of my most recent experience.  

I went during my lunch hour on the friday before Mother's Day.  

I wasn't really impressed with where I was seated.  It was a 2 seater table right in the main walkway and I constantly had other customers walking by looking at my table.  But that is the only bad thing I can think of about this visit.

My server was helpful in suggesting items on the menu.  I placed my order and it was out it record time.  

The food was great and before I had to ask for a refill on my fries, my server asked me and they were there in minutes.  I never had to ask for a refill on my drink.  It was constantly refilled.  The server was very attentive and even pointed out a survey with the check.

I've had good service and bad service at this restaurant but I will say this, the management is always willing to make things better.  At one visit I had a terrible experience, did the online survey and the management contacted me and appologized and sent a $25 gift card.

Keep it up Red Robin."}
{"text":"Being vegetarian, a burger joint is usually the last place I want to go for dinner. This Red Robin is in a shopping area and after a day of errand running my family and I decided to go in and eat since it was convenient. I figured I was going to end up with a salad and asking them to remove the meat, but was pleasantly surprised to find veggie burgers on the menu.  And it was actually delicious! I've been to several other RRs and this is by far the nicest. The place is spotless, bright, and all the furniture is fun and new. We had a great server (I can't remember his name, but he had an edgy hair cut with lots of piercings) and the manager brought out food out and checked on us. It was worth taking the chance, I'd come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I got hooked! The bread is soft. Food is served hot. The burger was delicious. The first time I tried this was  on Veteran's Day. They had the free burger for veterans  and we got the Tavern Burger. It was so good! 

The ambiance of the place was nice too. It was clean. It was busy that day also. After that, I signed up on their website for membership. They send promotions and offer every now and then. I got my free burger on my birthday too! Sweet! They give military discount as well. The onion ring taste good also. My kids love their burger and my husband loves it too."}
{"text":"I am mortified at the behavior & misinformation given by their manager, Spencer!  My friend had a gift card & we went in for lunch.  The place was hot, our table was uncleaned, and the service was abhorring.  Nowhere on the gift card did it state cash items had to be purchased to use the gift card, yet the manager insisted that we had to order something & pay cash to use it.  We chose to order a kid's meal, (nowhere does it state adults cannot order this) using the gift card, & he started yelling & screaming, again, refusing service.  Bad thing is, corporate sent the gift card, stating kids meals or anything could be ordered.  This manager was literally screaming, and very offensive. Other Red Robin Restaurants have Never treated us this way, but were kind & accommodating.  Will NOT return to this location-"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night....waited about 15 minutes for a table.  Longer than average time to get our spinach and artichoke dip app ($7) The lower price meant smaller portion of dip.  Ordered a grilled chicken sandwich tossed in their buzzed wing type sauce. ($9.99)  Entrees came in a timely manner.  Fries are good steak fries with seasoned salt on the table and a number of dipping sauces available.  I got my fries with the mayo/mustard sauce called campfire.  I should say I ordered my fries with it because when the fries arrived the sauce did not come with it.  By the time the sauce arrived the fries and wich were long gone.  I did use them on my second order of fries which came a good 10-15 minutes later.  Iced tea came pretty regularly."}
{"text":"Joined the loyalty program here and made this particular visit for their free tavern burger promo I received via email.  It was around 8-9pm so we were immediately seated in the bar area.  
Our waitress \"greeted\" us and shortly there after began complaining about her day due to the free burger promo.  Awkward City....but we pushed forward.   When I inquired about said promo she sarcastically/rudely said she didn't know because she \"just works here\".   She also forgot to take our drink orders but whatever no big deal.  Despite it being very slow we had repeated difficulty getting her attention for drink refills, condiments, etc...
I'm glad the tavern burger was free because it was fast food quality and tiny.  Spinash and artichoke dip was good and the fries with season salt available at the table are good stuff.   Probably won't be coming back for promos anytime soon."}
{"text":"Red Robin is and always will be a mediocre hamburger restaurant with a variety of appetizers. The entire menu is burgers, that's their thing. I guess you also have to mention they have the speckled lemonades and decent iced tea as well. 

My last venture to Red Robin was because I was out with a friend in Henderson and we needed a place to grab lunch. Well, I hadn't been to Red Robin in awhile so we figured hey why not.

We arrived a bit after lunchtime so the place was pretty dead. We were seated fairly promptly and the service was good. Our waiter didn't mess up our order, he checked up on us, etc. 

I ordered a chicken sandwich. Honestly I can't even remember the name, but it was of the grilled variety. The only thing I can really say about it is I did not enjoy the super white breaded bun it came on. I just think I've become used to better slices of bread. I've become spoiled by other places I suppose. My friend ordered a chicken sandwich as well and I believe hers had some pineapples on it. 

Their large steak fries were tasty and add a bit of variety to the meal. The waiter also asked us if we would like certain types of sauces to dip the fries in, which was nice of him.

Overall the food was okay, the service was very nice and competent, the restaurant was clean, and so was the bathroom. They do have a bar at the back of this location. I didn't realize that came standard with Red Robin, but hey, it does.

Would I be back? Hmmm. Possibly. But there are a lot of better places to get a burger in Vegas."}
{"text":"Have not had good success with ordering pickup on two occasions. Food always cold. Sweet potato fries overcooked - oil needed changing. Buns dry. Went to restroom one time.. noticed trash under several tables. Will give it another shot in the future, though."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Red Robin in years, and it will probably be years before we go back.  Pretzel bites were hard.  The taste of the mushroom burger was just weird.  Fries weren't great.  The onion rings were ok, but more breaded than battered.    They did sub out pretzel buns on our burgers for us - and the campfire sauce is tasty - but alas, not enough to make me return."}
{"text":"I have always loved Red Robin.  I went there and had the blue cheese burger (not sure if that is the real name of it) with a side of steamed carrots.  Every time I go there is a different cook, so if you are like me and like a lot of blue cheese on yours I suggest you ask for extra!  The carrots were actually nice and soft, I hate when restaurant say that they steam veggies and they are still hard.  The service is always speedy and polite."}
{"text":"It's a Red Robin. It's great for a chain restaurant and I love their Banzai Burger! Good selection of beers and even some local brews (try the Moose Drool or Epicenter from SanTan Brewing). The service here is really great and the staff is extremely friendly.
What I do like about this particular location is that the bar is on one side and there are no kids allowed in the bar area, so if you're with a group of friends, you don't have to worry about screaming kids."}
{"text":"I am glad Red Robin has moved to the future on its Point of sale system. They have a POS system on the table that you can quickly order apps, shakes, and pay your bill from. The system also lets you split your bill if you are with friends. No need to wait for the server to do it.
As far as food goes, I like the taste of the burgers, tasted the fiery burger, the special Uberburger, and the bansai burger. The negative on the meal was that the bottom bun of the uberburger was wet in spots so when sharing, i ended up forking my piece of burger. The other negative was that i ordered my fry refill when I was almost out. I should have done it earlier because there was a small wait so I had to pause eating. Can't eat a burger without the fries. So word to the wise, don't wait till your out to get the next basket of fries.
Thomas Wa was our server and he was a blast. Funny, attentive and concerned about our experience. I like servers who are willing to share a bit of themselves instead of being only businesslike. He is that type of server."}
{"text":"We've been to this location a few times over the past few years.  This is our favorite dine in burger place.  Not sure why some of the bad reviews.  We have always gotten good service here.  Our most recent visit was for take-out on Mother's Day.  

The food is always good, and hot, food looks appealing.  The prices are reasonable.  We noticed the last time we dined in, which was a few months ago, the decor of the place has changed to be more upscale, but the prices similar to last we remembered.  

Loved that we were able to pay at the table electronically and didn't have to provide our server with our credit card.  Wish I remembered our server's name, but he was super personable and shared with us his favorite way to eat a burger we were ordering, which was to put an over easy egg on it.  That was super delish and unfortunately when doing take-out, you can't do this.

We got refills on all our stuff that had refills and I think our server even refilled something that isn't normally refillable.  He shared with us some stuff that helped lower our bill but get the most bang for our buck.  That's watching out for your customers and considering them.  We never had to really wait for refills as our server was on top of things to the point things were getting refilled far too often.

Of course, we were a fun, happy group (husband, wife, 2 teenage kids) and not obnoxious.  We were very kind and friendly, and left a really good tip.  Maybe to those who don't get good service, maybe it's their demeanor.  All our food every time we've been to Red Robin has always been sinfully good.

Ordering online for Take Out was easy, too.  Our food was ready for us when we got there and it was still hot, though we got there about 15 minutes after they said the food would be ready, which was 13 minutes from order.

When we arrived home another 15 minutes later, so guessing the food had been packed and ready for us for about 45 minutes before we finally were able to sit down at home to eat.  I ordered onion rings and these were the best onions rings ever.  I mean, we've had great onion rings before, but considering they had been sitting in the packed take out container for at least 45 minutes, one would expect that the onion rings would be limp and soggy.  On the contrary.  They were still crisp and delicious.

In fact, our meal tasted and felt like it was served right from the kitchen immediately when we finally sat down to eat the food at home, and this was it being in take-out containers for AT LEAST 45 minutes.  Really, if you're in a hurry and don't want to wait for the lines you can sometimes get, try ordering Take Out online.  

Anyway, for the poor reviews of this place.  Sorry.  That's not our experience.  Maybe we just got the right servers all the time, and came at the right times."}
{"text":"Had a great visit here on Saturday.  Jeanette was our server and she was perfect.  She read our minds without us ever saying so.  She saved us money, too.  I ended up getting a free burger.  She refilled our drinks quickly.

The food tasted great.  Great ambiance.  We came about 12:30 pm on Saturday and it wasn't overly crowded, but there were still plenty of people here.  We did not have to wait and got seated quickly.  

Good food.  Good prices.  Great service.  Good environment.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Red Robin not because of the food really, but more because there's no real selection for other family not wanting a burger. There's one page roughly on the menu for salad or such. Tonight I ordered the fish and chips, hubby got a burger, my boys had a kids meatball meal and shrimp and chicken. They really have shrunk their plates and offer endless fries etc, but your getting so much less than they use to make for a higher price. The kids meal looked like frozen meat out of a bag and by the end of the meal everyone was still hungry. Our fries were cold. I will say they did bring out more fries that were just cooked and my fish was excellent. The server was pretty busy and only came back to our table once, but was very friendly."}
{"text":"Never bad service here. The servers are always great every time we come here. I love the different sections of burgers. The bar tender makes delicious drinks each time . I'm a loyal customer"}
{"text":"I agree with other diner, stick with the burgers/sandwiches, their salads used to be excellent but the changed them and now there is about1/2 cup of lettuce in a salad (????)"}
{"text":"The people here are RUDE and they do not acknowledge you when you walk in, and if it wasn't for the bartender Steve, we would have left.
We wait over 10 minutes to be seated and while waiting, the hostess \"Rial\" came to her podium about 3 times and never once said anything to us, never said hi how are you never said sorry for the wait, or I'll be right with you. 
When she finally came to sit us down all she asked was how many? Then turned around and started walking. 

I will never come to this location again.. Never!!"}
{"text":"Environment is great, service was awesome. Our server was Brianna, she was truly great, my husband's drink was always full and she always made sure we were good and stayed on top of us. Awesome! 
Burgers can use a little work and maybe the cooks can pay attention to detail on tickets a little more, on orders."}
{"text":"I'm loyal to Red Robin. Almost too loyal. It's pathetic. That's why it pains me to give three stars to a company I have been so committed to for literally over a decade as my Burger joint hotspot. 

Alas, my last visit didn't go so hot. Food was delicious as always so I don't want to unrealistically give 1-star. Place was clean as far as my eyes had seen. I was greeted by a very cheerful and friendly hostess, but I will say (in effort to not let our main server be singled out), that the three servers we encountered while there weren't the friendly bunch. I got eyes rolled on two separate occasions. Once when I chased the server down for a size upgrade on the shake. And once when a separate server collected my cash on behalf of our server and asked \"did you want change?\" When I said yes he rolled them back as well and said \"Kay.\" as he mean mugged his way  into the kitchen. Our main server didn't do anything particularly mean herself, she just wasn't really that pleasant at any point. 

I love Red Robin. I'd get a tattoo of the logo if it wouldn't guarantee a lonely future. I say this because I want to express \"you're better than that.\""}
{"text":"Food was good. Servers and staff were excellente! Red Robin also offers so many unlimited deals too... free refills on root beer float (and they let you take a to-go cup), free refills on fries, free refills on fancay dranks whaa. But two people in our group suffered a severe case of food poisoning or something like that after eating here. The meat was definitely undercooked."}
{"text":"so we arrived and greeted by Justin who was very nice and sat us immediately. the place was crowded, but not too loud. Rachel was very and explained the menu to us, there were so many choices. We settled on the whiskey burger No Mayo, endless sweet patatto frys and tortilla soup.  Loved that  Rachel asked little pink or no pink.   
 
Food came quick was hot and good.  Not sure why others rate RR 3 stars we had such a great time and the food was delious.

Now let's get to the best part - desert!  We switched to the Gooey Chocolate  Brownie Cake.  Heaven help me it was amazing and the hit of the night."}
{"text":"We visited this Red Robin for the first time tonight. We have been to many Red Robins around the valley and usually love our experience but tonight not so much. Of course it was busy, and I get that but our hostess, Stephanie, didn't even bother to speak to us. She looked at us for a few seconds before my husband spoke up and said \"this many.\" She didn't ask us if we had a seat preference and just walked over and pushed 2 small tables together, threw our menus on the table and walked away. Just seemed so rude! Our waitress was sweet as pie but forgetful. And forgetful is fine, but if you can't remember write it down! Erika, our waitress, brought the wrong drink for my daughter, which is fine but then no one offered her coloring papers. She had to get upset seeing all the other kids coloring first, and then we had to ask and then wait 30 minutes and asked 5 times before she finally remembered. At the back of the section, there was a balloon rack with one balloon left. I knew they gave them at the end of the meal so I told my girls to wait and they probably could make us more. The people next to us were leaving, also with 2 girls and their waiter went and made a 2nd one since there was one left on the stand. When it was our turn, there were no more and so sorry. My daughter was disappointed tonight and it made me really bummed because we don't get to go out very often. We also were never asked about our Red Robin card and of course we just wanted to leave, so we missed out on a couple burger points too!"}
{"text":"Did i really just pay 13.29 for this pathetic sandwich? the \"prime rib dip\" looked so good on the menu, but what showed up at my table was a weak, dried up little sandwich, with no flavor, chewy overcooked meat, and served on what was nothing more than a tiny, hard oversized breadstick.

our waitress annie, while pleasant enough, seemed unconcerned with the fact that i only took one bite out of this sandwich before pushing it aside, and DID NOT want a to go container. i dine out a lot, and this was possibly the worst most overpriced thing i've been served in a long time.

The \"game day nachos\" were almost equally sad. at 8.99 they came with just a handful of chips and the same gross \"cheez-whiz\" style sauce you squirt on your nachos at the local 7-11. disgusting

the rest of my party seemed ok with their burgers, even though my son ate less than half of his, and also did not want a to go container.

at $65 for 3 people ($78 with tip) this was a completely dissatisfying and overpriced meal."}
{"text":"my daughter w/ a double ear infection enjoyed the kids mac & cheese so much that she was dancing in her chair and singing \"yummy for my tummy!\" so this place is a solid lock if you've got kids who are naturally picky eaters"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and our meals have always been good.  Service is prompt and food is hot. Just to note that Micah was attentive and courteous. 
The amount of fries they give you to begin with is small, but it makes sense because they will give you more when you run out. It is a wise cost decision. I love the Red Royalty Club (card) and if you don't have one, get one - free is always a winner!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was real bad. Waitress only brought out one of our two drinks. Had to ask for sugar for ice tea and it took forever for them to bring it. No silverware for our food. Never brought our to go cups for our drinks. Just overall terrible service. It was 3:30 in the afternoon and it wasn't terribly crowded so there are no excuses. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I am typing this as I sit here. I've never written a review for a restaurant but today will be that day. Let's start off by saying I'm very disappointed!! I came here for a birthday burger. I was seated at a table that was not clean. Still waiting to be spoken too and it's been 10 mins. No hello, no I'll be right with you; no water, no nothing. It would be a shame to leave getting a free meal but It looks like that is what I'll be doing. 

My review does not represent the company but the Northlake Location in Charlotte North Carolina. 

Thanks for the birthday gift."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. Bae and I took the kids to dinner at Red Robin on a Friday night. When we first arrived it was fairly busy, but we still got a table rather quickly. The first person to approach the table asked for our drink order. We requested a kids menu first. He copped an attitude and said \"it's the same drinks as the regular menu\". Note that the prices are different since some drinks are included with the cost of the kids meal. We think he was a manager because his polo was different from the rest of the staff. The crowd died down shortly after we got settled in. The meal itself didn't take that long to come but it took a good 15-20 min to get a refill on the drinks and longer to get more fries. The dipping sauces we ordered at the beginning of the meal barely made it out with the fry refill, which could have been dessert as late into the meal as we got them. Thankfully the tables have the machines to pay since we never saw anyone else after the first refill of fries. The dishes were dirty and the soda was watered down, the silverware and napkins were sparse. All in all we will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I Felt like a sucker eating here! 

Buns had the beginning signs of a day old, burger dry.  Bill was $11.00, I figered im paying $5.00 for the decor.  Fruit extra charge, mostly cut up apples.  

On a positive note, a good place to meet for parking, and than walk over to Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm! Solid place to eat at if you like burgers! So much variety, very good customer service. Bottomless fries oh my! I been to this place around 10 times, very consistent and seems to never be too busy. I always sit around the bar area, being that I'm over 21. 

They get four stars because the parking sucks being that it's close to the mall. Also, because they got my order wrong once. 

That's not a huge problem, but the guy who was taking my order wasn't using a notepad or anything. Going straight off memory. If you gonna do that, get my order right. 

All in all great place. I may go this weekend! Ha"}
{"text":"I don't visit Red Robin too much.  On my last review I said I would prob not come back for a year.  And yep.  I checked.  I last reviewed this place 4/29/17.  Wow. Just over a year ago. 
And yet I'm giving it the same three stars. 
I sat at the bar to watch the baseball game. No sound from the TVs.  Guess I'll just make up my own play by play. 
The item I ordered was a Guacamole Burger.  It was cooked as requested.  No problems there.  The fries came out with it but for some reason I only had like ten fries.  Being unlimited. I figured no big deal.  I asked for a refill.  And for some reason I never got the refill.  When the check arrived she asked how my meal was. I said good except you never brought me the refill. She did apologize. I told her I didn't want them anymore. 
But my biggest complaint of the night was the floor.  Weird.  I almost bit the dust three times. There was some type of slippery film on the floor.  Not sure what that was.  I had on non slip shoes. Yet I couldn't get a grip at all.  This place should be ashamed of itself for creating a hazard. The manager on duty should have known.  It wasn't hard considering I seen several other people walking carefully throughout. Does this mean I have to wait a year again.  Who knows."}
{"text":"Our experience today at Red Robin here in Chandler, AZ was less than perfect. The greeter did not smile and was not courteous. It seem like she didn't want to be there. We were eventually seated and our waitress came over introduced herself that was fine. About five minutes later we had another waiter to come over introduce himself. We became confused and told him about the previous waittess. Next it took 20 to 25 minutes before our food came out luckily it was still warm however we needed condiments and knives to proceed that took another 5 minutes. Our food was getting cold. The quantity of fries and broccoli that they brought out was so small it took them a long time to bring out the second batch which was cold and by that time the burgers were eaten. We noticed that other tables that were seated around us were getting their food out way faster than we had got ours out originally. As we were leaving the lobby was completely full of people with a bunch of empty tables inside. It points to poor management and being understaffed. I don't want to take out the service 
totally on the waitress and waiter however this is really bad for business."}
{"text":"Companion and I wanted burgers and decided to go to Red Robin. We had been to this location previously and had been satisfied, but this time we were quite unhappy.

Things started badly when they tried to seat us in the bar. Companion is handicapped and sitting on high chairs in the bar makes no sense. One would think the person seating us would notice the cane, but seemed oblivious to the situation. When we asked for a different place to sit, the look on the persons face said it all - we were considered troublemakers.

After finally getting a seat that we could use, we sat and waited and waited and waited. Eventually, the server Natalie showed up. We ordered drinks, and they had to be sent back because they were wrong.

After quite a while Natalie showed back up to take our order. We ordered an appetizer of Artichoke Spinach Dip, when when brought out was still ice cold in the center and had to be sent back.

Next we ordered our main course. Companion ordered the Fish and Chips with Mac and Cheese, and I ordered the Mushroom Burger with Garlic Aioli (75 cents extra!)

When I was asked how I wanted my burger I asked for it to be as rare as they could make it. Instead, I receive a well done burger with a tiny cup of Aioli sauce on the side. For those not familiar, Aioli is basically nothing more than mayonaise with some garlic added to it - hardly something that should cost extra.

I had asked for my fries to be well done. Instead I received flacid, greasy fries. After I had eaten more than half of my burger a different waiter noticed that I had not touched my fries and brought me fresh, hot, crispy ones that were just what I had wanted.

For a $42 bill, this was totally not worth it. I felt I wasted my money.

For purposes of authenticating this review, service was on 4/9/2015 @2:36 in the afternoon at table 13/1 on ticket 30014 with an incorrect number of guests listed on the ticket. 

Red Robin prints on the check to tell them how they did. I'm telling them they did poorly."}
{"text":"I stopped going to Red Robin many years ago because of the poor service, but on Saturday night my wife convinced me to try it again. Needless to say it hasn't changed except the prices went up.  At first I thought that maybe I was wrong the server arrived quickly took our drink and appetizer order. The appetizer arrived hot and the server checked in, told us he would bring more chips. Never saw the chips but I was still chewing when they cleared the appetizer dishes away.  Then came our burgers I had a tavern burger and my wife had the royal Red Robin. I upgraded to a \"big\" burger on the suggestion of the server, a big mistake. The patty makes the quarter pounder at McDonalds look like a half pound. The only thing I could was a nasty BBQ sauce no cheese no tomato not even the bacon. My wife couldn't finish hers because the egg was too runny, if you know what I mean.  Meanwhile I waited for our server to bring a second round of drinks we ordered when the burgers arrived and more fries. Needless to say the fries must be with the chips we never got. A manager stopped by and asked how things were, after telling him he wanted to reduce our bill, but we had already checked out. Our server-did show up with drinks when we were getting up to leave. All in all why people think this chain restaurant is worth going is beyond me save your money and find somewhere else, preferably locally run"}
{"text":"Worst service possible. Took almost an hour to get our food. Never refreshed our drinks. No bottomless fries. This place is a joke!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  What a disaster.  Worse hamburger EVER!.  Don't order lettuce-wrapper unless you want about 1/2 head of FROZEN lettuce which made the sandwich cold and very sloppy trying to get to the meat.  Don't order the Sriracha double burger because the sriracha onion straws are NON-existant.  There were a (very) few small fried onions.  We mentioned problems to the waiter when we asked for our check.  He, of course, sent the manager over.  The manager was sorry and offered to re-do the burger.  No, we didn't have time (or patience for that).  It's too bad the waiter never came back to our table after he served us--perhaps the problems could have been corrected in a timely manner.  Waiter forgot to adjust bill for a coupon and again the manager came to resolve the issue.  The manager did credit us a free beverage on the bill.  Then when we were leaving the manager offered us a $10 gift card to come back and try again. No thank you.  We'll give the gift card to someone else who might be interested in trying again--but not us.  We have a lot of other places with much, much better hamburgers AND service that we can go to."}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested we go here today before our movie. I was planning on suggesting another place, but she got their early and got a table DARN!

I don't hate Red Robin...I think I avoid it because I am not a big fan of hamburgers. Seems like more of a place for straight guys and kids if you ask me, but my experience today wasn't to bad.

Our waiter was really nice however I think that may have been a result of my push up bra.

Ordered the Crispy Chicken Salad which also had hard boiled egg, bacon, and veggies and was very good. I'll probably get that again next time someone drags me here. Get it with that Italian dressing. Yummy! 

My friend ordered us onion rings as an appetizer I hate onions, but those were goood! 

Not my first choice but good crowd pleaser with more decent food than most chains."}
{"text":"I wish I knew what everyone ordered because the final amount was a lot it seemed. I believe it was over a hundred. There was six of us and three were already there before us, drinking. So maybe that's why the price was so high at the end. The food was good, waitress forgot my cheese in my burger but it was still good. I don't know why but I wasn't really impressed, not something I'd write home about. My boyfriend certainly liked his food, even said he would want to go again. The steak fries were his favorite. All in all, the service was pretty decent considering it was a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"NYE last minute bite.  You could tell they were letting staff go so it took a while to take our order and it was extremely cold but the other servers and hostess pitched in to take our order and serve our meal.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I come in about once or twice a month. Service here is always impressive. I've never had a bad experience. Food is consistent. And, their email club sends out lots of coupons."}
{"text":"I just moved to this side of town. So, while I'm a fan of Red Robin, my 1st visit to this location left something to be desired.

We popped in at around 630p on a Sunday night. The restaurant wasn't full, but the lobby area was. I'm not sure what the reason was, but we didn't have to wait any more than 5 minutes and the host was pleasant.

When we were walking to our booth all I noticed was how filthy the floor was. Straw wrappers, French fries, napkins. It wasn't a few spots, it was the whole place. It was a huge turn off.

We ordered 2 iced teas, an order of the pretzel bites, and split a Black Pepper Burger ($32 with the tip). Even though it seemed like a long time to get our food, I may have just been impatient. Everything was good, but the burger was like warm at best.

Our service was excellent, though, so I might give them another chance."}
{"text":"Had the new roast beef with au jus sandwich.  I was able to sub a caesar salad for the default bottomless fries.  Server was friendly and understanding as I had a few questions for her before I could order.  

The fourth star was for the complimentary birthday sundae that was waiting for me when I had arrived back from a visit to the restroom.  Now why would I rate an extra star for this, you ask?  Since I actually paid for the meal with a birthday coupon, I had not expected the complimentary sundae.  Quite thoughtful of the server, I thought, and this act garnered her a few more dollars in tips!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy some of the gourmet burgers here- the salmon wrap, the BBQ burgers I(chicken or beef), and the new roasted beef with au jus.  On my last visit, I tried their fish and chips and really enjoyed it!  I liked the crunchy batter-coated cod with tartar sauce and lots of lemon wedges, and how can you knock their bottomless fries?  One tip: if you dislike soggy fries, like I do, DO NOT order their garlic-parmesan fries.  Not only will you not find a single crunchy wedge, but the amount of grease will make you weep."}
{"text":"We've always loved the Red Robin burgers. First time in this particular RR.
Had one of their special burgers, the Damn Good Burger. Oh HELLS yes that was a good burger. Seriously yumminess was had. Scott had another special burger, something like peppercorn something. He said it was super good too.

Our waitress was a nice gal. There were definitely some training issues, she let us sit a while before we got our drinks. No major complaints, again I do believe it's a training problem.  Unfortunately we aren't born with Customer Service skills.

We'll definitely go back. I love those burgers!"}
{"text":"There's nothing I do not like here. The food is superb... the shroom burger melts in your mouth. The beer selection is first rate. The service is excellent and it was a relaxed and fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Just average . . . I ordered a burger, and I said I wanna make my own, and this is what I want on it . . . lettuce, tomato, onions, mayo, and avocado.  What did I get?  CHEESE, avocado, and onion.  They offered me a bunch of french fries as a token to make up for the wrong burger, and to eat while I waited for the new burger to be made.   The waitress was super duper, she said everything I asked for was on the ticket, but the kitchen messed it up.   The new burger arrived to my specifications, but the two patties of meat looked and tasted just like a Big Mack (sic) . . . average . . . oh, and some of the lettuce was brown . . . meh . . . !"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I really like Red Robin - but this location should be shut down due to health code violations.  We went there on Saturday, June 23 for dinner.  The restaurant was not very busy HOWEVER IT WAS FILTHY!!!   I am not taking a few fries on the floor where a toddler just threw them. I am talking carpets have not been washed in YEARS.  There was food on the walls that had been crusted on, tables sticky, floors were disgusting, bathroom a mess. The person who delivered us our food looked like he had not washed his clothes in a week.  If the front of the house looks like I can only imagine what the back of the house looks like.  I will never eat at this location.  I wonder what the health inspection looks like for this location."}
{"text":"Burger was great , the only thing I don't like was that the two order of fries were barely warm.  I like my food hot!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I came in on Wed. Night for dinner we had a party of 6 plus a baby(using a high chair). We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated and when we got to our table it was against the wall, half booth half chairs. My husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said \"No\" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us, luckily she's a great baby!! The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced.
The worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back. The waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in. We live 3 1/2 hours from Mesa and it's so disappointing to run into this kind of service, this was definitely not a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service by Rachel today . Very friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Service was not all that great. There is never a host when we walk in, so we are waiting forever to be seated. Also, My orders have  been messed up many times due to servers lack of listening skills."}
{"text":"Not the same Red Robin
Have been going to Red Robin for years  at least once or twice a month and always looked forward to and ordered the French Onion soup,  They have cut the serving size down and changed the serving ware.  Very hard to have a cup of soup in a square serving dish and serving size is definitely not a cup.  Will go other restaurants from now on.  Always had great service there, but if the food is disappointing, service doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Worst place . Came in with a party of 7 they could only accommodate us by splitting us up into separate booths. This location is horrible"}
{"text":"So, to be honest, there are a lot of other places I'd rather go than Red Robin. A lot. However, I go here two or three times a month on average. Service is normally quick and the service is almost always good. They're able to keep good servers over time, and many of them can guess our orders. Always nice. Huge plus for fluten-free options. Tortilla chips are made fresh, but can be chewy, and sometimes we run out of chips."}
{"text":"Went in about an hour before close and it wasnt busy at all. Took about 10 minutes until someone came up to seat us and when she came up she looked very dirty and couldnt even look at us or smile at us. Seemed very unhappy and unpleasant. Then told us it will be a few minutes when there was about 50 open tables. When we were seated the server came to help us after like 10 minutes of sitting. She was cery busy so we understood. Her name was Ashley and she was very nice. Food was mediocre, nothing special. Experience was good other than the rude person feom the beginning."}
{"text":"Walked in and they weren't very busy. Seated promptly to a filthy table. Took over five minutes before our server came to take a drink order. After that we never saw her again. Literally sat at the table for an accumulative 12 minutes before just getting up and leaving. Never stopped by anyone on the way out and walked past multiple employees while leaving who were standing around not doing anything. How do you forget a drink order consisting of a coke and a tea?? Probably won't ever be back, terrible terrible terrible service."}
{"text":"I come here every Friday for carryout. The bartenders Ally and Chris are  A+. If they're not working, I don't order. The orders never get messed up when I order with them. Food comes out on a decent time and the place is always clean. We got a royal Red Robin burger, clucks and fries, and a southern charm burger. They even gave us extra fries to take home as well. 
I came here 3 weeks ago with my mother and wanted to wait to review because I wanted to also include a carry out review. So she got some chili burger which she was so excited about. I got a mushroom burger. Both burgers were cooked perfect. Chris was our waiter that day. He kept our drinks filled, brought us extra napkins, and fries before we even asked. The manager comes around to each table to make sure orders were perfect. While we were there it was someone's birthday so we heard them sing and clap. 
The place is always clean, tables are always wiped down, not sticky. The booths are fluffy people friendly. 
There is usually a line on weekends because it's so busy. It's nice in the summer because there is outdoor sitting!"}
{"text":"Really want to like this place because my kids dig it. The atmosphere is cool casual & very clean. Service is usually good, but for a place that pimps out its burgers, I feel like I'm eating a fast food burger patty on a fancy bun, sauce & veggies. The meat is not juicy & falls flat. I've ordered burgers before & never look forward to coming here because of this. I ordered the smaller spivey jalepeno burger (can't remember name). This place is always packed so I'm sure i must be a minority & wish them the best here."}
{"text":"Great service. Stopped by to watch the 4th quarter of the nba finals and sat in the bar with the bartender Drew. He was awesome. Great service. Anticipates the customers needs. Always within eyesight. Provided requests in a timely manner. Very knowledgeable about the menu. I always enjoy red robin but this was the best service I've ever received at this establishment. Just wanted to leave a droplet of positivity :). Have a great day."}
{"text":"Almost 2pm, been sitting in the bar waiting for someone to come by for a good 10 mins There are only 5 other tables with small groups of ppl. Time for me to leave."}
{"text":"I don't know if all Red Robins are the same but this new location is nothing but a glorified Chucky Cheese. Lots of kids and bad food. I ordered a clam chowder, it was so watered down and yet the chef still serves it. The other dishes we had seemed thrown together as though nobody cared. Didn't feel the love at this restaurant , I will not be going back."}
{"text":"My favorite thing used to be a southwest salad.  They've now changed it to include breaded jalapeno rings and a \"cheese tostada\" - both bad additions in my opinion.  The crispy tortilla strips were better. 

Our appetizers arrived after our meals did,  so the manager removed them from our check.  

It was quite crowded at lunch time,  but our 15 min projected wait time was only about 5 min. Our server was courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Terrible service. No greeter. No one tending the bar. Sat and waited entire room of guests wondering what was going on"}
{"text":"I dined here yesterday 6/27/18 with my Niece. We were seated at a high top in the bar. The lady who sat us (I later found out that she was the manager) was so nice. She showed us the hooks under the table to hang our purses! The bartender Natalie came out to greet us. My Niece asked her if she had a gluten free menu. Natalie told us it was online. Neither one of us could pull up the website. Natalie told us to hold on and went to get the manager. The manager (I forgot her name) came out with an iPad and literally went over every item in full detail that was gluten free. She was able to find a great meal. 1/2 through our meal the manager came back with a website and stores that my Niece could buy this special gluten free breading. Natalie and the manager were so nice and patient! Ohh and the food was great too! Keep up the good work ladies!,,"}
{"text":"Decided to try Red Robin through Grubhub even though I haven't ever had a great experience with Red Robin in general. We did get our food delivered but it wasn't complete. I called immediately and spoke with a manager who couldn't be bothered to help me get my meal fixed, which was for my daughter. The manager told me that it was their dinner rush in the restaurant and she would have to call me later. I never received a phone call and never got my order complete, the order I paid for. My family WILL NOT ever order from or visit a Red Robin again."}
{"text":"I would say this location is 50/50. Half the time we go here, we have a decent experience, the other half, not so decent. Some of the most common things that happen on a bad day are slow service, wrong orders, and straight up attitude giving waitresses. We mostly do take home orders from this location now and so far haven't had any negative experiences with that yet."}
{"text":"Love the selection of burgers and quality of the meat. Prices are a bit more than I'm willing to pay most of the time. If the prices were a bit lower I would come to visit more often. But there are several other competitors at a lower price point with similar or better tasting food"}
{"text":"This place has always been a favorite. We usually go here around Christmas time. The food is always great. Also had a really cool interior. Last time we were here, we had a order mess up with the table next to us, but no big deal. If anyone is considering going here- I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Don't try to order take out from here. They just put you on hold forever and forget you as you sadly and slowly starve to death."}
{"text":"Kids love this place, I on the other hand think it is alright.  I like their burgers but I don't think I should pay $12-$14 bucks for a gourmet burger and fries.  We do get unlimited fries so that helps.

The kids usually split a Royal Red Robin cause of the fried egg.  I get it, fried eggs make everything better.  I usually get the Bleu Ribbon but this time I wasn't that hungry so I got a double tavern burger for $6.99 and of course I got the garlic fries.  The burger was still pretty good.  For some reason the bread seem to break apart but the bbq sauce kept it together as best as possible.

They have good beers here so that is also a plus.  Be sure to call ahead or go to a late dinner cause this place is always packed."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, portion sizes are typically good but tonight it looks like we got the end of the supply when I ordered the Clucks and Fries. Tasty but more like kid size meal, however. You just can't beat that they have bottomless fries and they are good! Quick service, friendly staff but one hell of a noisy kitchen at 9pm!"}
{"text":"Got a pretty cranky waitress named Jessica that had an attitude problem from the moment she rolled her eyes at us walking in the door. However, the food was excellent and the manager was super sweet."}
{"text":"The food is good and definitely a fair value. I can appreciate that they label some of their dishes \"gourmet\". This restaurant is a family friendly atmosphere. Since I was a kid, this was one of my favorite restaurants and that they are able to evolve their menu with the times is why I believe they have been successful over the years. 20 years ago my favorite was the Red  Robin taco salad"}
{"text":"Classic burgers, awesome fries and onion rings.  I always add the \"red's relish\" to my cheeseburger, it makes it unique."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service every time. Susan was our waitress and exceeded our expectations in a big way! If you get a chance to request a server, choose Susan! She was on it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the $15 deal for two tavern burgers, fries and an appetizer.  Burgers were decent, almost no fries in either box seems like if you dine in and they are unlimited they should put more in the box on a to go order.  Paid the $2 extra to upgrade the boneless wings app to a full order for the 8 year old which seemed worth it.  This deal was a better value than ordering off the menu as their prices strike me as high for a burger and fries for the most part."}
{"text":"This is the closet location to me. My family and I were super excited to hear that they opened one in downtown Summerlin. However I wish the management was different. When we walk in we have to wait forever to be seated. I had to walk into the bar to tell the bartender to get someone to seat my family and I. Things here just seem really unorganized and needs improvement. All the severs look like they hate to be there and it throws off the vibe. You guys seriously need cooperate to show you guys the ropes again."}
{"text":"You get endless fries or broccoli, I don't know if they have a third option for endless food.  What they don't tell you is that the broccoli comes in a 1oz serving and you have to ask for it 11 more times if you want to eat 12oz of broccoli.  I know this because I lived it.

The burgers are good, they will even make them a lettuce version with no bun if you ask.  The burger comes off a bit watery, as in liquid pours out of the paper they serve it in.

The bathroom is clean enough, but not as clean as you would hope.

The menu could use some updating, and they do charge for mushrooms on your burger, and it isn't something trivial, it is more than a dollar and at that point why not get another burger instead?"}
{"text":"Camp sauce, I like it.  It has none of the heat of the Bad Daddy ketchup but the flavor is great.  I prefer the heat but not everyone does.

The burgers here are better than Ruby Tuesdays and most other similar places.

What really pleases me are the unlimited sides. You wanna strap on the feedback and go nuts?  You can eat fries, sweet potatoes, or brocoli.  I feel healthy after having four servings of the broc.

You can take a lot if liberty with how you order your burger.  Change the cheese, add onion straws, add mushrooms, whatever.  You can't sneak in free eggs or bacon but lots of toppings.

They added new touch pads to order stuff and call over a server.  The summon doesn't always work as inrended. It beats my owl eyes, where I stare st the waiter until they come over.

I like it here more and more and the birthday burger doesn't hurt.

Child portions are very large.  Dare I say a good value."}
{"text":"The management here really needs to take a long hard look at some of the servers you hire. Came in last night got seated after she cleaned the table. I saw so many dirty tables just sitting with trash all over. The two servers who saw us be seated right in front of them make and a female around 830 pm. He's bragging about making 2 grand a week! Yes he said 2 grand a week waiting tables! Why are we still tipping for bad service? After about 10 mins of being ignored by these two we walked out! Absolutely ridiculous behavior bc as I'm walking out the same server sarcastically thanks us! So remember that when going to this location! This was not the first time of bad service or no service at all! Maybe it's bc we're white"}
{"text":"Do not eat here!! The place is dirty there was a big roach under our table and the service is shit! The manager just said sorry it's ARIZONA haha"}
{"text":"I love this location. Great customer service and the burgers are always cooked to perfection. Don't eat here a lot because a burger with fries will total how many calories you should have for the day and I don't have the metabolism for that."}
{"text":"The new decor and menu changes are fantastic. Had a great lunch there today and our server Raven was awesome. Not sure how I got it but they gave me am extra bowl of clam chowder just because.  Got signed up for the rewards card because we plan on going back often. It was perfect."}
{"text":"Sitting at the restaurant now Danielle is our server doesn't really pay attention to us but her other tables she is attentive to. I won't be coming back here again rude server and never checks on us the mall location needs to be retrained in customer services manager doesn't care or try to attempt to fix the problem"}
{"text":"Sooooooooooo....


I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but my family seems to love them. Being my brother's birthday and not wanting to go against the general consensus I met my family down at this Red Robin for lunch on Saturday. The hostess was generally unhelpful due to half my party already being seared and her just sort of shrugging and not leading us back to the table. Luckily my brother is hard to miss so I was able to find him easily. 

We started off with a few apps: onion ring tower and pretzels with beer cheese. We would have also had the hummus but unfortunately they were out. The onion rings were standard--crunchy and onion-y. Breading didn't totally fall off which is always nice. The pretzels were piping hot with a crispy exterior and a soft center with not too much salt. That is how I prefer my pretzels so I was pleased. The cheese dipping sauce was very strong and overpowering. I'd skip it, but my family seemed to really like it. 

My main burger was something with Bleu cheese, onion straws and some unfortunate tasting orange sauce. The sweet potato fries made up for it, but I found the onion bun + Bleu cheese to be a not so good combo. My sister had a similar complaint about her Southern Comfort burger, saying that there were entirely too many flavors competing and none of them complimented each other. 

Someone else had the 4 cheese melt and honestly I'm bummed out that I didn't get it. It was a grilled cheese with the perfect amount of cheese, perfect crispness, and excellent bread. 10/10 would get it again. 

For dessert we tried the croissant donuts. They were warm and yummy, but not worth $8.99 per order. I'd rather go to Dunkin. 

Though the place was decently full for 2pm, our server was prompt, friendly, and quick with refills. I liked being able to pay at the table with cards instead of having to have them run back and forth processing everything. This place is not my first choice for chain restaurants but I'd choose it over Applebee's any day of the week."}
{"text":"Management needs to get a clue.  If you are going to have your servers take money, make sure they can give back ALL the change due a customer.  We were told that they weren't allowed to actually give change, but if we wanted, she would have to go to the bar to get the rest owed to us.  That's a bunch of crapola.  Unfortunately it cost her a decent tip."}
{"text":"I normally am a huge fan of Red Robin and have never been disappointed until this evening. As usual I order the clucks and fries, buffalo style.  When I order the clucks I ask for an extra plate so I can cut into them instead of trying to cut them in the basket and cutting up the paper. When I cut into the clucks this evening I noticed the chicken was extremely undercooked and by this time I had already taken my first bite. It was very pink in the middle and made me immediately stop eating. The server came back to the table and we explained what was going on, she offered to cook a whole new set. I went through the rest of the chicken to see if it was necessary and 3 out of the 4 pieces were all undercooked. I immediately gave her the entire basket back because I didn't want anything more to do with the food in it. She was nice enough to bring me out a new meal and comp me for the clucks but by then my entire table had already finished their food and had to then wait on me to eat my entire meal. I was nervous eating this basket but all seemed to be ok this time around. I appreciate the new basket and giving me my meal for free but undercooked chicken makes me very nervous. I not only will probably never order that meal again but may also avoid the restaurant all together."}
{"text":"I love Red Robin.  Their rewards club is great.  Besides the birthday burger they always have tons of promotions.  Their Burning Love burger is one of my favorites.  I've also gotten it with grilled chicken and in a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.  I'm usually all about a proper burger, but that's super delicious too, and it saves over four hundred calories (that you can use towards more fries, of course.)"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers for a reasonable price. I got the A1 peppercorn burger and my husband got the bleu burger.

A1 peppercorn- not too much a1 sauce as much as I'd like, but it was still really good!

Bleu burger- just enough bleu cheese, my husband absolutely loved it.

Complaints-
Both burgers were well done when we asked for medium rare. It was not too big of a deal for us but the manager gave us 25% off for our troubles.

This establishment is awesome in serving great food with great customer service! Definitely coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Had a very great experience here. Our Server Lauren was great. My sister order the pina colada and said it was the best one she has ever had so have to recommend that. It was an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Gourmet Burgers?!?! I think not. In-N-Out makes a better burger and is half the price."}
{"text":"Red Robin is a good place if you want a hamburger that's a step above your typical fast food drive up joint. They are similar to Culvers but doesn't offer you that \"home quality\" kind of experience. 

I typically get the Bleu Ribbon with some pink. I like the fried onion straws they add to the burger as well as this chipotle spread they use after toasting their buns. Mix that with the burger, BBQ sauce and bleu cheese and you've got a great tasting large juicy burger. I sometimes have to cut it in half because it's hard to take a bite out of. The burger comes with a side of endless steak fries they are often cooked to perfection. They are one of the few places that offers onion rings, however, as much as I love me some rings, I do not care much for theirs. The onions they use are extremely thick making it hard to bit into. I have often times ended up just eating the breading and putting the onions to the side. They are onion rings! This doesn't make any sense! They need to slice their onions thinner. As of now, I do not believe they are editable. 

My other negative is presentation. The Bleu Ribbon has a lot going on so I realized that sometimes the burger can get messy. However, there have been times where my burger has come out looking like it went through a tornado. Lettuce falling everyone, too much BBW sauce, bleu cheese thrown on. The presentation needs to get better. I've experienced this at two different Red Robins. Also, I've also noticed that within the last year, they've cut back on the amount of steak fries they give you. Since they are bottomless it makes really no difference but I've definitely seen a change. 

That being said, I would rate Red Robbi as being more than just an \"A-OK\" burger joint but they are far from a \"4+ star\" quality kind of joint. I do like the atmosphere. They have a few game machines, TV's, bar, background music and great classic pictures hanging on the walls that are great for helping to start a conversation ( say you're on a first date?). The art and photography they use to decorate the place I believe adds a lot of character and \"spunk\". 

They do get very busy on weekends so expect a wait for a table and for your food but from my experience, it has never been extremely long. Wait staff has been good for me as well. 

Overall, they are a solid burger place. A bit pricey but I do think they are good. 

Oh, one more thing, if you're dieting,....The Bleu Ribbon is 1,001 calories and fries are close to 500 calories!!! (According to my \"Lose it!\" app - they could be wrong but I also believe this is an extremely high calorie meal)"}
{"text":"We recently received an email for BOGO burgers and the bae and I were craving those bottomless fries with some good ranch (ya know the kind of running, delicious kind) so we decided why not stop by Red Robin for lunch. We came on a Saturday afternoon so it was pretty busy. We were able to get seated at a bar top table though within about 10 minutes.

Our sever was pretty spotty throughout the meal. We seen him maybe once just to place our order, didn't receive refills on our drinks at all and ended up checking out our own bill on the table tablet. If the service had been a bit better maybe I'd give an extra star because the food was pretty decent. I had the Burnin' Love burger with a veggie patty. I loved the spice, but probably could have done without the fried jalapeño coins since they were soggy. The fries were what we really came for and those hit the spot.

Overall it was a decent visit, nothing too out standing nor too terrible. I'd probably come  back again and try a different burger next time."}
{"text":"Alisha was fantastic! I came in on my lunch to get some yummy food and she was super attentive and very helpful! Great service!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday afternoon. So I know I can avoid the children and loudness from families. Ordered the over easy egg burger (forgot the name of it) it was delicious! And the fries are never ending so that's always a plus! The only downside is that they only gave us each ONE napkin. And the meal was a bit messy so I asked the manager for more napkins (when the wait or was taking too long to check up on us) and he have us ONE more napkin each. Me and my friend practically laughed out loud. And for the manager to have done that. The only disappointment was the obvious clinging as of napkins. Sorry don't mean to be whiny, but when your starving and just wanna scarf down your yummy meal but you can't because your napkins are soaked and no one is coming by to ask if you need anything, you can say it was quite annoying!"}
{"text":"It's burgers in plastic baskets. Enough said. If you ever take your girlfriend here dont ever expect to get married. Ever. It's a kids place. Expect to hear bitchy little kids all night."}
{"text":"What not to love unlimited fries and great burgers. I love the milk shake. I would rather pay $3 more dollars and go to roaring fork.  The prices here are way overpriced for burgers in a plastic basket. But mighty tasty. I really want to give four but my index finger wont let me."}
{"text":"Great burger and the bartender was kind enough to tell us happy hour started in 10 minutes - so we could get a better deal.

I will be back for sure when I am in the area."}
{"text":"A chain burger place. 

The burgers are pretty good actually.

Get the strawberry lemonade concoction they brew up.  It's really good.

It's just a standard good chain hamburger.

Service is always prompt and seldom is this place crowded."}
{"text":"all i can say is, red robin, yum"}
{"text":"Love Red Robin, Burgers are best, can't say the same for the chicken sandwich at this location. I frequent the one in Peoria on 83ed ave and to me that is the best one. Not sure why the quality seems different at different locations but people I have been with say the same."}
{"text":"Got to love Red Robin for a great burger and the chicken is great also good. My go to place for a quality quick burger. Nice that they have a full bar too. I enjoy a nice glass of wine or whiskey on the rocks with my meal. ;)"}
{"text":"We were the first ones here at 11am, so we had no problem getting a table. We ordered and our food came quickly, go figure. I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger. It tasted great but fell apart after a few bites. The bun just didn't hold up. Red Robin has good food but nothing spectacular. A solid 4 star restaurant."}
{"text":"I've always loved RR but today was off. We tried the chips / salsa/guac, the smoke n pepper burger and bonzai burger. The smoke n pepper had no pepper on the thin crispy bacon (not thick cut) but the sauce was tasty. bonzai burger was made with a much smaller patty. Like the ones they put two of, on the new pub burgers, but just one small one my burger. So I'm wondering if the cook today was paying attention?"}
{"text":"This place was ok. Service was not the best but again, this is a new location. The seating seemed a little run down for a newly opened restaurant. Our waitress was genuinely trying to be attentive but she did have quite a load of tables to wait on. They don't serve a large quantity of the bottomless fries so we kept having to ask her for refills. It would have been nice if we were sat a little further from the tables we were surrounded by. There were quite a few empty tables and the hostess seemed to only be seating the booths which were not comfortable. I think my returns will be rare."}
{"text":"I dont why this place has 2.5 stars.. great food, great staff and it's Red Frigging Robin!.  I found a new love for the original burger with the relish.. yummm..."}
{"text":"I will always 5 star Red Robins.  Because this is my go-to place when I cant think of anywhere else to eat. 

- Great service
- I always know what Im going to get
- It's always good.
- Awesome Iced Tea
- Awesome decor on the walls
- Sports on TV.
- BOTTEMLESS french fries!!!!!!


See? All the great qualities of a burger joint."}
{"text":"Old Reliable... 

That's what our family calls this place.   When we cant think of a new place to eat when we go our, or everyone is arguing about this place or that place, we always say \"Ok, well lets go to Red Robin..\"  

Ive been here at least 20 times, and every time I go, it just gets tastier.  I mean, what place offers all-you-can-eat fries?  Steak fries!..  Funny though, even knowing I can have more than one basket, I get just one.. 

If you want good service, use Tim.  He rocks and is usually serving the tables in the middle or the booths just next to them. 

What to get?

I love their Royal Red Robin burger.  Call me traditional, but how awesome is it that you have a hamburger with a fried egg on it?  Gross you say? Ohhh just the opposite, mouth watering delicious.  

If you are in to wings, they have these amazing dry rub wings that just bite you back.  Id get a ton of them if they were cheaper.. 

Also if you love Root beer floats, get ready because for $3.00  you can get all-you-can-drink floats.  How cool is that?

I love their iced tea.  All I drink when I go out is iced tea and Red Robin has some of the best out there.

Ugg.. i feel like going there for lunch now .  Damn you Red Robin!!  Maybe this weekend!"}
{"text":"A local favorite... can get very busy.  Service is good and the food is as expected. The salsa is really quite good.  Who knew?"}
{"text":"Red Robin has always been one of our favorite go to restaurants for a consistent meal and a pretty darn good burger. The kids love it and we enjoy it too. However maybe a year or more ago Red Robin corporate decided to \"improve\" their menu to make it appear more gourmet and offer more \"fancy\" sauces. All they ended up doing was increasing prices and lowering food quality and consistency. Now this location has decided to remodel as a desperate step to become \"hip and cool.\" The service has been horrible the last few times we have been here. Inexperienced and rude waiters and slow service. The food is just okay or not good (soggy tasteless hamburger buns are now standard). And the \"bottomless\" fries are served in piles of about 8 and then it takes the server a good 20 minutes to bring you 8 more fries. I bet they are saving all kinds of money on the fries. But they are losing me as a customer.  

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Turn the funk up. This place is TOO consistent this is my fourth location and at every one the food was great and very helpful staff always thus far. Good shit brain"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers idk why this location has a bad reputation or lower star rating I don't know why keep up the good work guys. Love your BBQ burger and endless fries and the garlic aoli suppurb."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Red Robin, the last times weren't very good.  But, a friend and I hit the movies, and decided to head over to RR afterwards for some burgers.

Firstly, their menu has changed...dramatically!  There were so many more options.

Secondly, the service was wonderful.  Our server, Brittany, was friendly and very helpful.

Thirdly (and most importantly), it was really good!!

My friend got the Keep It Simple and I got the Bleu Ribbon.  Everything was on point.  I'm not a fan of chipotle mayo, so I got it on the side and gave it to my friend to add onto her burger (she loved it).  My burger had steak sauce, bleu cheese crumbles and crispy onions on it...yummy!!  Also, I got the garlic & herb fries, which we got an extra basket of, since they're bottomless.

Told hubby about the great experience, so we'll be heading to a RR in the very near future."}
{"text":"It took 25 minutes for my food to come out. No manager came. Ask how we are doing and right when we walked out i checked my bank statement i see 3 charges.for a place that wasn't busy you would think someone would get decent service."}
{"text":"We went to this Red Robin right after my daughter's graduation rehearsal.  I wanted to treat her to a nice, teen-oriented meal to celebrate; this was NOT the place for any sort of celebration.  There were three tables filled (should have been a hint) six servers standing around the register and NOBODY actively assisting their tables.  We saw the waitress when she took our order and when she dropped off the bill and that was ALL!  The manager was the one who ran our food, who filled our glasses for the ONLY refill we got (and after we had been out of drink for twenty minutes) and got something the server forgot to include on the first order.  That manager ran herself ragged filling the requests of the tables in the restaurant, all while her servers stood and gossiped in the corner.  I tend to give servers the benefit of the doubt, but it was painfully apparent she had lost control of the people working under her.  She needs to speak to corporate about making some heads roll.

As for the food, it was subpar.  The tavern burger was the same as one of those value meal sandwiches you can get from the drive-thru for two bucks.  And there are no bottomless fries if you can't find the server to deliver them!  Don't bother with this place.  Not until the manager gets a backbone."}
{"text":"Bugs, This place has bugs! The last time we were here our friend has bugs crawling in her lettuce... I think we won't be back for a long time. Its too bad because RR generally has some of my favorite burgers."}
{"text":"My hubby and I got take out and everything was delicious! They also had it ready To go once we got there which was nice. Well done and way to redeem yourselves from the last visit!"}
{"text":"The staff if you are eating is great! though if you are calling in your order from phone is a bit disappointing. Tonight was the third time i tried to call in advance to order up a burger and fries to pickup and was put on hold only to have the phone \"picked up\" and hear people talking but no one was on the phone.

The staff is friendly though I think where they are dropping the ball is the way the call in food service is setup.

1. the person that answers the phone is not the person whom will order your food, but transfer your call to . . . . . . the bar. 

2. this transfer will put you on hold from 3 to 5 minutes (from my last three times i have tried to experience decent phone call in)

3. when they pickup they take your order but they are not wait staff, it is a bartender. So their priority is not the timing of the call or food. 


** It is the last time I will trying to order pickup from Red Robin. **"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location since they opened here and last night I went with friends to an early dinner. For a Wednesday night they were super busy, but our wait was only about 15 mins. and our hostess was very sweet.
   We ordered for our apps, the queso with bottomless chips and then the Jump Starter Double with zucchini and mozzarella sticks. The zucchini sticks are to die for and the queso was delicious!
For our entrees we ordered the Whiskey River burger, the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger and the Black and Bleu burger. 
   The Black and Bleu burger was just okay. For another $3.00 more to order this particular  bleu cheese burger instead of the cheaper \"Blue Ribbon\" burger doesn't seem worth it to me. As always the fries were great, my complaint with them would be that my friend requested more sweet potato fries and they didn't get to her until she was basically finished with her burger (not the first or second or third time this has happened). So at that point it wasn't necessary. 
  We'd go back, but I do feel like the quality has slipped a bit over the years from this location.Skimping on the fries they give you when you first receive your order (then long waits for refills) and overall quality of their burgers and toppings."}
{"text":"Good burgers and sandwiches. I've been to this location a handful of times and it has been satisfactory every time."}
{"text":"Gourmet Burgers? Not even close! I would recommend Fat Burger and In & Out Burger before I would recommend Red Robin.

We ordered the \"Big Whiskey\" and the \"Black & Blue\".

I have not eaten a Whopper since I was a kid, but after trying the BW, I now remember what a Whopper taste like. Seriously, I thought I was at Burger King. The only difference was the $12 that Red Robin charges you for the burger. Then I was offered the option of parmesan fries for an additional .99 cents. I was served old fries that were cold and broken in small pieces.

The Black & Blue was good. It was made with Black Angus Beef, mushrooms, and blue cheese. It was served on a ciabatta bun.

The service was good. We were greeted by a hostess upon our arrival and she also asked us how everything was before we departed. The server did a fine job and a woman that appeared to be a manager stopped by our table to say hello. The server brought us fresh fries after I brought the old fries to her attention, so I did not bring it to the managers attention. The cooks should not have sent the fries to the table though. Also, when I asked the server if the meat they used for the Big Whiskey burger was USDA Choice, she said she would ask the kitchen staff. Upon her return I was notified that there was not anyone in the restaurant that could answer my question.

Summary:
$37 for two small burgers, two drinks, and two sides of fries.

I do not recommend Red Robin as place to go for burgers."}
{"text":"I came here again last week and was not disappointed!  Nice, outside seating, fresh hot fries, awesome burgers as always and they were quick with getting the check to us so that we could get back to work at a decent time.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Once you've been to one Red Robin you've pretty much been to them all. I've been to this location a few times when visiting family & friends in AZ and everything has always been just fine. Burgers, salads, appetizers, etc. are all pretty standard. Every time I've been here the service has been fine. Now that I think about it, I think each time I've been here it's been with friends who have small children. So yeah, this place is good at accommodating kids.   

Normally I'd give a place like this three stars, but I'm bumping them to four because of the bottomless fries. If you order anything on the menu that comes with fries they'll just keep bringing them to you when your out. The last time I came here me and a friend were waiting on another friend who was running late (because of her kid) and we asked the waitress if she would bring us fries while we waited since we knew most likely somebody was gonna order something that came w/fries, and she had no problem doing so. 

Also, even though this isn't a place I would necessarily seek out for watching football they do have several TVs if you happen to be here when a game is on."}
{"text":"Great experience! We were greeted quickly and escorted to our seats. David H.  was our waiter and he was very hosptiable. He made sure our drinks were always full and kept the fries coming as an appetizer. Entrees came within 5-10 minutes. Had the siracha burger and unlimited fries. Will definetly dine here again."}
{"text":"I love the endless root beer floats here. great place for decent food ar a low cost. the endless fries are good too!"}
{"text":"Today, 9/30/16, just spontaneously wanting a burger -- which I don't eat too often. Decided to come here an eat their Royal Red Robin .

Mindy was the manager floating and assisting her servers with the not-so-busy climate in the restaurant being 5pm and not reaching peak dinner time. She kept ensuring her customers were well fed, and always stocked with whatever they needed. I'm an observant guy so when I see a manager on the floor and being extra enthusiastic with her customers, it just shows that she's serious about customer service. She didn't mind taking food plates from customers, bringing sauces, and even bussing tables. She wasn't a high horse about her position like most managers I see in a food and beverage facility. Mindy assisted us well, and our table neighbors in a very polite manner. 5 stars!

Harrison was our server. Nothing but positive from this guy. Enthusiastic, brought our food to us in a timely manner, AND respectful of any requests we had. I'm not sure what he told the guys in the back but they brought us a mountain high mud pie for no reason and he acted like he had nothing to do with it, it was on the house. 5 stars for him as well!

Thanks Red Robin! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We usually go Tempe Red Robin. But this one was closer. 6/1/17 I got to say, Ryan was a great server. Request him if you can. I enjoyed the food and Ryan never let our drinks go empty. Thanks!!! :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant got a new general manager and the service and food has been improved greatly! My husband and I were not going to go here anymore after a few so so experiences but a few months ago we decided to have my birthday burger her. We were happily surprised by the improvements! We went today and our server,  Stephanie was awesome. She got our drinks and everything we asked for Quickly. Try the restaurant again if you used to go to it - you will be happily surprised at the changes."}
{"text":"Red robin will give you I well cooked burger at a reasonable price I'm a big fan. Appetizers are very good and portioned well"}
{"text":"I will just put it out there and say that prior to our last visit I would have rated them as a 3 star restaurant. Our last experience was definitely a 5 STAR visit but I wanted to take into account my last several visits.

I ordered my usual Whiskey River BBQ burger which is a personal fav, requested as pink as possible. This request is typically difficult to please for me and the burgers come out dry as well as the burgers brought over to the table looking like they were just thrown together. That was not the case. The burger came pink, perfect, and had a high-end restaurant appeal to the presentation of the plate. It was extremely pleasing to see this was the case for all dishes brought out to the other tables. The service was quick and our waiter was extremely courteous as he was also a Purple Heart veteran who was medically discharged. Kudos to you and thank you for your service. Friday night was busy and a hit! Will be back to visit again probably sooner than usual. I just hope the kitchen staff is as motivated every day of the week."}
{"text":"this place is pretty good Im not sure about gourmet burgers? I thought they were kinda expensive then other restaurants but you do get unlimited fries  i think our server was a little sarcastic??  But nice I'm in the industry so i get how someone can something the wrong way but i didn't bug me Im not sure if ill be back But maybe ill give it another shot"}
{"text":"I'm a fan; I had a pleasant experience! I even had me some of those bottomless steak fries I kept hearing about. Now that I think about it, I may have had every type of fry they offered... And some onion rings. 

The bottomless rootbeer float is a good choice of beverage. My choice of a gourmet burger was the Sauteed 'Shroom which I thoroughly enjoyed. Whenever there's a mushroom and swiss on the menu, I always make sure to try it. And let me tell you, there was an abundance of mushrooms in my burger. I'd say there were about three fistfuls! I am not exaggerating.

The reviews here, so far, are pretty mixed, but I'd have to say that my experience resulted in a good meal. My server was lovely and accommodating. My friends and I were content, so I'm glad to have a Red Robin closer to my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS LOCATION ZERO STARS!! I called to order some food for take out and had to repeat the order over and over for 15mins dude to the employee not being able to speak clearly or pay enough attention to listen. I've always enjoyed their food in the past and was looking forward to showing my family visiting from out of town how good it was. I went in to the restaurant 23 mins after my order as instructed and then had to wait almost another 30mins for it to be ready. Seems like this situation isn't the exception but the rule as other people who were irritated and had been waiting for their food long before us got it almost the same as time we got ours. I get home and open the bags to find our food ice cold as if it was taken from other orders already sitting out and forgotten, barley any fries inside the containers (endless fries....? Yeah right!) and each of the burgers looking like they were prepared incorrectly seeing as each had pieces and residue of condiments we specifically asked not to have put on while ones we did ask for were nowhere to found. I called to speak to the manager so I could let them know what garbage was being sent out as the to go orders, and let her know of my dissatisfaction. I told her I'd be leaving this review and she should make sure others don't get the same kind poor excuse for food once they get home. Although they did offer to remake food I didn't feel like taking the chance of the same thing happening again. She asked for my email which I gave and then promised she'd be sending me out an email to \"have our next meal on us\" coupon and yet to my surprise I haven't received anything in my email. If you feel the overwhelming urge to get take out I highly recommend checking each and every part of your order seeing as this specific Red Robin can't seem to correctly prepare food. I wish I would have gone against my gut and drove to any one of the lower quality fast food places instead, at least they get it right and I don't spent 50$ for ice cold , incorrectly prepared, garbage food. If I had known this would be the quality I food I'd be getting I would have gone to McDonald's instead....."}
{"text":"The food and service were both amazing. The location is in the mall area so it does tend to be busy, however the wait was not too long and my food took no time at all coming out."}
{"text":"Red Robin is open later than their competitors which is a bonus for people like me who eat late. The bottomless fries are amazing. You have to try a chili burger. Their chili is delicious and mixed with onions. The prices are comparable to their competitors. The service was decent but could have been better. It could have been because I was the last person in the restaurant at night but still.  I will be coming back many times in the future."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Red Robin! My family comes here a few times a month and the staff does remember us, which is great. One waitress who no longer works there knew my parents' order by heart, which they loved and now another waitress is trying to do the same thing. :)

Who can beat bottomless fries? We always ask for them to bring some before the food comes since they are so yummy. I love getting them with buzzard wing sauce and ranch dipping sauce and covering them with that special spice they have on the table. My mom gets the side salad, which is also unlimited and they bring that before the food also by request.

My favorite entrees are the Royal Red Robin (burger with an egg over easy on top and bacon, which I get on the side and take home for my dog) and the Crispy Chicken sandwich. I ordered the adult chicken tenders and fries and the Tavern Double one time each and I liked them both also, but not enough to choose over my favorite entrees. I got the macaroni and cheese as an additional side once, but it was very filling (it was bottomless and I still couldn't even finish half) and I'd never choose it over the fries. 

I ordered the Buzz Tavern Double once and I hated it. It's a double cheeseburger with special spicy sauce and mac and cheese in between the patties. It sounds good in theory, but I don't recommend it! My dad said the same about the smoky tavern double. 

Make sure to join their loyalty club because you get a free burger during your birthday month, a free entree after 10 meals purchased and coupons every week. We've gotten coupons for free appetizers before and we tried the fried pickles and the onion rings. Neither were anything special and we never ordered them again. Besides, who needs apps with bottomless fries?

I'm not a big dessert person, but I ordered the birthday cake milkshake once and it was just ok. My sister likes the Cookie Magic shake. The other desserts sound good, but I've always gorged myself on too many fries to want to order them. 

Red Robin is yummy, comforting and family friendly, so you have nothing to lose by stopping by when you can!"}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in a visit to Red Robin in my life. I got to the restaurant at 2pm and left at 330pm, not by choice at all. The only reason it has two stars is because the food was great. The service however was atrocious. I sat down with my friend, looked at the menu, and had plenty of time to do so. Then out came our waitress, she did not introduce herself at all. She then asked what we wanted to drink, we told her. We even told her the food order, in all hope we could leave in a good amount of time; but that was not an option. The people that came in after us were served and we were sitting there sipping and playing around with our ice cubes trying to make something out of this wait. We eventually got our food, and proceeded to eat. We finished our absolutely delicious food, and waited another 30 minutes. I felt as though we were in prison. We eventually saw our waitress and asked for our check. I think it would be safe for time sake to not go here if you don't have two hours to waste sitting in an uncomfortable chair. Hopefully this helps others!"}
{"text":"Experienced the WORST service at this location! We were seated for 40 minutes until our server even showed her face. Two parties who were seated after us were finished and completed with their meal before we even had water in our glasses. The server completely ignored us and then we we completed she had the audacity to show attitude. Needless to say, we will NOT be returning to this location."}
{"text":"5 star for service:
We were first greeted by a Gentlemen, I believe manager. I didn't catch his name but he was very personable. His welcoming was not robotic and for the 1 minute he spent with us... we knew the restaurant was well managed. He also made sure we had a booth that we requested so extra plus for that. Momentarily we were greeted by Katy, our server for the evening. She is.... so.... good. She's happy, and you can genuinely tell. What impressed me the most though is how the colleagues interacted with one another. They tell each other Thank you and excuse me. Without a good team environment, you can't offer great service- they've obviously nailed both down. We came at a busy night.... sat down for about an hour and there were 4 birthdays around the restaurant. Came during Tuesday night 6-7. ( I really hope my server name is Katy lol... If not she is the blond, thin, tall, and nice of course!)

4.5 for food:
I ordered the A1 peppercorn burger, as I love A1 sauce. The flavors are definitely there. My friend ordered the whiskey river bbq burger... now that's one delicious burger. it's worth the calories, take my word! Only order that if you love bbq sauce just an fyi. I ordered the sweet potatoe fries for an additional cost and that was very good too. Only reason why I gave -.5 I request for medium rare... meat was completely cooked through. Maybe cause the patty is quite thin or while it was sitting on the warmer plate it may have cooked on its own.

This is my first Yelp review I am writing so thank you red robins for a great dinner. Definitely good for casual eat and for families with kids. (They have beers too ;) ) definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"Red Robin...Yummmmm!!

From the endless fries option (which J and I never take advantage of) to ordering off menu and getting a custom burger, Red Robin is awesome.  

There isn't a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich on the menu.  Sad.  Very Sad.  HOWEVER, the waiter/waitress does magic for the ticket and I always end up with a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich in front of me!  YAY!!

If you don't have one already, be sure to get a Red Loyalty card.  With the registering of this card, you can get a free burger for your birthday!  Gotta love free stuff!  :)"}
{"text":"This is the last time I ever go to this Red Robin. We went kind of early, expecting a wait. They told us it would be 30 minutes. It turned out to be 45. No big deal. On the way to our seat we saw the number of un-bused tables. The lobby was full of people waiting to get in and 30% of the tables just sat there. In fact most of those tables went un-bused while people waited. You could tell that the manager of this place just didn't care. 
The food took forever to get there and the fries were old. We ordered a refill of the endless fries and never received them. Wait staff were checking their phones in the dining room. Kitchen staff were coming out to check the TV even though the game wasn't starting for 30 minutes. All told we were there for 2 hours and 10 minutes. That is not good when you are there with kids. And it is not good for the restaurant when they need to turn over the tables fast. 
Then I had to take my kid to the restroom and it was like we were in a third world country! There was some kind of hair net/dew rag on the floor and both toilets were stopped up. 
I should have known when I saw the health rating of 94 that we should have gone elsewhere. Never again there are too many other good burger places in CLT."}
{"text":"I've been going to Red Robin for years; I'm not sure why I've never reviewed it.

In my opinion, there is no better place for a burger than Red Robin. Yes it's a chain, but the quality of their burgers is superb. Couple that with their bottomless steak fries and you will always leave satisfied.

The service is usually top notch. The server was a tad slow today, but that is definitely the exception and does not sway my 5-star rating."}
{"text":"I love Red robin!!! I have not eaten a bad burger yet, they are all great. If you do not mind sweet items on your burger, I would highly recommend the THE BANZAI BURGER... 
services: hit or miss... 
prep time: 10-15 minutes
atmosphere: family/ friends
Best Thing: bottomless fries ( they are awesome)
Tip of the day: if you sign up for their mailing list, you can get a free burger on your bday and tons of discounts!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were out Christmas shopping when we came across this place.  I've been to this place 10 years ago in Detroit and I knew they had great burgers.  My husband had never been, so we decided to go.  We were greeted with open doors by the hostesses, seated quickly and greeted by our awesome waiter Dustin super fast.  He made us feel welcome.  I got a peach iced tea and I drink a lot of tea.  Thank  you God for Dustin!  He never let my drink get empty and when he brought out a new tea for me, I never saw him he was just that fast.  My husband and I were like where did that tea come from.  Awesome lighting fast Dustin to the rescue!  I ordered the Whiskey bbq burger  medium with sweet potato fries, and my husband got the Whiskey bbq chicken with onion rings.  I loved my burger and the fries were a little salty but good.  My husband liked his onion rings, but the chicken was a little dry.  I went safe and got a burger because that is what they are known for.  He also got mint fudge shake, which was pretty good.  Overall, the place was nice, the food was good for the price and the waiter was AWESOME!  Best service we have ever received.  Thanks Dustin!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!

Location is convenient and with having so many large corporate restaurants to compete with on Bell, Red Robin still stands up against some of its big dog competitors!

Real easy for ya here: Great selection of burgers with bottomless steakfries, 
red robin's own seasoning,
typical domestic beers, bar area is really cold all the time, limited tvs
perfect for kids, groups, families, etc.
games and balloons for kids as well...

Quick service, 
And I've yet to have to send anything back
Ohhh, and they have a veggie burger (or vegan boca) just to cover all grounds!!!"}
{"text":"Food was yummy as usual. I love the fries, my mom and I usually split a burger if we're together which we did again. We had the Bacon Guacamole burger it's delicious as usual. The service leaves much to be desired. there were only about 6 tables the waitress was working yet she couldn't manage to remember what the three of us were drinking or keep them full. Also she dumped over a soda on the table next to us and didn't even apologize! Then only half whipped the booth (we suggested to the other diners they might want to finish wiping before they sat down, also told the waitress to move the poor women's purse considering what she did manage to whip went right into the purse.). All in all though the food is yummy and good for kids, we took our 9 month old who is always a gem in restaurants and there were several other kids there."}
{"text":"Great service, solid choice for a good meal. 

I know it's a burger place but I love the fish and chips as well. Fries are fantastic and endless but I only have wanted more when I split a burger with someone you really get plenty with your meal.

Service has always been wonderful, never anything less then completely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"3 PM on a sweltering hot day.  When I lived in Connecticut (4 years ago), there was a Red Robin in the Boston Post mall.   The motif was a 50s diner and similar menu.  Relatively cheap burgers.  That's what I was expecting as I walked toward the door.  

What I found was a fairly upscale bar that happens to serve institutional food.  I ordered the \"Arctic Cod\" fish and chips with the Orange cream Soda.  The cod were overcooked and tasteless - closer to fish sticks.  The plastic container basket seemed designed to cool food as quickly as possible and awkward to use.  I neither asked for more steak fries or a refill

The music playing was annoying, along with the sports on the TV.  Most people would probably consider that a plus.  The waiter explained to me that the chain in CT was a different company.  That's not true.  They reimagined themselves to not tcompete against Steak & Shake or 5 guys, which was what I was hoping to find"}
{"text":"We decided to try our local RR since it was close to home and we had a gift card. Glad we didn't have to foot the bill for a sub-par meal. The waitress was attentive and our Onion Ring Tower appetizer arrived as expected...hot and tasty! The burger ordered by my companion was definitely not as tasty as other RR locations in our area. I ordered the Fish and Shrimp Duo...big mistake...it arrived barely warm but the slaw was nice and hot! Obviously the victim of heat lamps used before a meal is picked up.Thankfully the \"Bottomless Fries\" were not offered...ours were limp and soggy! The restaurant appeared old, tired and needing a good cleaning! Sorry RR we won't be visiting this location again!"}
{"text":"Where do I start. First of all the walls are dirty. I mean when you're sitting at your booth and you look at the wall there's handprints, ketchup, mustard, and. liquids that dried up on the wall. I'm talking old stuff too.
Secondly there's ants on the walls. I killed five before my waitress came by finally then I showed her. She just leaned over and killed a few her self and said sorry. For some dumb reason we decided to eat there still. My Burger came burnt, I mean crispy. Ate it anyways cause just wanted to get out of there with a full belly. Towards the end of the meal the Waitress came to me and Apologized for the ants and asked if we wanted to move. This is a full 30 minutes since we originally pointed it out to her, we had already ordered food and ate it it since then. Little late for that. I will never go to this establishment again I was just really hungry and didn't want wait to get seated somewhere else. The waitress tried really hard to do her job, maybe if she had some training and didn't try quite as hard she would be a better waitress. That and clean the place,  and learn how to make a burger. Then I might try it again. Great fries though."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the truly perfect dining experience!!!! The burgers and bottomless fries are so tasty and the staff is wonderful!!  Mmmmm. Good eating, everyone!"}

Recently, I changed my diet for the better and now I don't eat red meat. I came to this restaurant with my family a couple months ago and I decided to try their chicken burger. It was absolutely fantastic! Great flavor and it included tomatoes and avocado on it as well. Fantastic! Our waitress was very sweet and had that good old southern charm. I give this place a solid 4.5 but I bump it to 5 since the service was so nice!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Minor problem with our service but it's understandable because we went during dinner rush."}
{"text":"I always get their veggie burger. Good place to go if you want a burger fries and drink. They also offer some chicken sandwiches. Solid place. Menu is focused around burgers but there are some other options."}
{"text":"OMG Bottomless Root Beer Floats!! Their freckled lemonade is phenomenal too but honestly, I could't pass up the root beer floats. You can't go wrong with bottomless french fries and ranch dressing and they are the only place I know that serves the fried chicken sandwich with pickles and onions, YUM!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service !!! 
The only reason why this is getting two stars is because the food was decent. This place is usually such a cute place to go on a date night! Last night my boyfriend and I decided to go on a date night here ! We didn't get noticed for like 5-10 mins after we got there, and we finally got seated. Our server forgot about our drinks, so we waited for like 20 mins just to get a drink. The food came out sorta quick but the service was absolute trash. Our server barley came to our table to even ask how everything was but went to the table across 3-5 times within 5 mins."}
{"text":"Again this is only my second review that is not an absolute favor of the restaurant but I have to say I was a little better that my Cheeseburger came with Sweet pickles yuck I have never ever ever ordered a burger and had a come with Sweet pickles the waiter did ask me if I wanted relish on my burger and I said yes unknowing that he was sweet relish with Sweet pickles why would you do this to a great burger the only other travesty that they could've done was to put Miracle whip on it"}
{"text":"With all the food choices in this area there's no good reason this Red Robin should even exist.  There were filthy, unbussed tables completely surrounding us for the first 20 minutes we sat there.  The floor was filthy, the tables are packed in very closely, it felt like our neighbors were joining our conversation.  The burgers came out, overcooked and *dry* and her fries were somewhere between barely warm and cool.  Not once did the waitress come back to ask \"how is everything?\" because I could have said \"not good.\" and fixed it then.  We were too hungry to flag someone down and make a thing of it and wait longer for more food so we just ate.  Then the bill... $36 for two burgers (we both drank water.)       There's no reason that this place should exist with all the good food choices in the area, please patronize somewhere else."}
{"text":"Holy crap!  I whined to my wife about coming here and have veered clear of Red Robin for years because my family always went to Chili's growing up. Wife always went to Red Robin. 
Well, I'm a believer. This Red Robin is super clean and has great staff. The food was fantastic and so they really have it together. I was really happy my wife made me come and we will be back."}
{"text":"Red Robin used to be a family favorite and we would eat there quite often, however, that was many years ago. I had not been to this location though prior to today and I was quite pleased. The employees were all friendly, providing excellent service. My group of four was seated instantly, but keep in mind it was a bit past noon on a Wednesday so not that many people were there. Our waitress checked back on us frequently and would initiate the refills without request needed. 

The main factor in stopping in for lunch today was to try out the tavern burger menu. It is a more affordable option in comparison to the typical $13 burger that one would normally expect. If I remember correctly, there were about six burgers for the price of $6.99, which is quite the deal since it came with bottomless fries as well. The one I selected in particular was the Sir-Acha Double Burger; it was delicious and I loved the onion strings that came in it. In the end, the bill wasn't too bad, but then again we could have made better choices when it came to ordering drinks. Three of us decided on trying the speckled lemonade (strawberry lemonade) not realizing that it was over $4, but the refills made it more worthwhile. Overall, I will definitely be back to eat at this location at some point."}
{"text":"Food took over an hour to prepare, then was incorrect, missing items and freezing cold. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Drive a little further and find something better."}
{"text":"The guacamole bacon burger was good.  My grandson played with entertainment thing at table with games. We ordered blue moon beer half way through look at my glass and they're lip prints on it and they are not mine! !! Waitress finally comes over after about 20 minutes of bringing us to go box and says if paying with card you can you entertainment
Thing to pay.  I go to pay and see there is $1.99 charge for the entertainment thing , No where on there did it say you will be charged. I could have brought Tablet in for free. I haven't been to Red Robin in a long time and I can say I won't be coming back! !!!"}
{"text":"I checked in here on a Sunday, it was rather slow.  We went for my child's birthday, since it was a kid friendly place we chose Red Robin.  We were immediately seated but it took the server at least 10 minutes to acknowledge us and take our beverage orders.  The hostess ended up taking our beverage order then only half of the drinks came out.  Our server was still a no show (MIA) and we had to have the manager take our order.  30 minutes later our food arrived. We ordered Boca substitutes and they were both cold and not cooked.  
The manager said he would comp the fee for the games on the tablet left on the table for the children.  The tablet is a new thing sounds genius that replaces the kids menu cross word puzzle but they charge for the use.  This tablet is also used to pay for the credit card service, and when the final tally came out we were to pay the bill and the entertainment fee for the tablet was still on the bill.  We had to find our useless server to adjust our bill then we finally paid and left.  If it were not my child's birthday we would have left during the initial wait period.  My last review I left a 3 star review being nice.  Actually this time I would give a no star, and the server did not deserve a tip because she did not do anything."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here on the 12th (which was a Sunday) at 12pm for lunch on his birthday. We were fully expecting some sort of an after-church lunch rush, but were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away by a hostess who was very cheerful and kind. This essentially NEVER happens to us because we come in with a double stroller containing an our 8 month old special needs foster son and our 14 month old daughter. And to top it off, we also have our 4 year old son. We tend to enter restaurants expecting to get a \"could you please wait one moment?\" while the hostess frantically searches for an empty area somewhere that she can stick our circus. Which, by the way, we honestly don't take offense to.... we totally get it. Lol. 

Anyway. We were seated right away, and greeted right away by our waitress, Vanessa. Vanessa is AWESOME. She was prompt, polite, and didn't look at us sideways NOT EVEN ONCE for bringing 3 kids under 4 out for lunch. She had our drinks and appetizer out within minutes. And by minutes, I mean MAYBE 3-4 tops. We placed our order, and even our food arrived to our table within 15 minutes. All of our food was steaming hot and SO good. I stick to a mostly vegan diet, so Red Robin is somewhat of a \"rare unicorn\" thing for me. I went all in (since it was the fiance's birthday and all) and had the new salmon sandwich. HOLY SHIT. Order this damn thing! AT ONCE! I can't even explain, it was just perfection with each bite. My fiance always gets the burnin' love burger made with chicken and swears by it. 

Suffice to say, the service, the Vanessa, and the salmon were ah-mazing. Hands down the best Red Robin experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"With the new updated look of this red robin I'm not sure if it's enough to get me excited about the food. Service has always been accommodating but I have ate here several times and my food has not been consistent. Multiple times have I gotten French fries that I could tell we're not fresh. I understand waste is a huge concern in the food industry but a national chain restaurant as  red robin has to set their standards higher. You have to take pride in the quality of food you are providing your guest."}
{"text":"We just walked in with our kids to try to get her burger because it's usually a great meal. Unfortunately tonight there was no one working so they refused to seat us even though the entire place was fairly dead. I guess the review as if it's a weeknight and you and your kids are hungry go somewhere else since they don't have enough staff to accommodate. Unfortunate cuz usually their burgers are very good we love them"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night very busy but we were SAT quickly. Our waitress was very kind attentive and fast. I didn't like my burger and it was swapped without a problem,  then when it was ready and manager brought it out to me and made sure I was very happy. The customer service was amazing!!"}
{"text":"The waiter was great! Very attentive however my chicken sandwich was still very pink in the middle. The manager apologized & offered to make me something else & take my meal off our bill. I'm just glad I didn't eat it! My husband enjoyed his meal, clucks n fries. My gingerbread shake was sooo delicious!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a Red Robin, my brother and I waited there roughly 5-10 minutes prior to seating. I ordered The Big Tavern, bottomless steak fries, strawberry lemonade, and the onion rings tower appetizer to top it off. 

My brother had the specialty: the Ramen Burger. It's messy, but he mentioned how much he loved tinkering around how to eat the thing. The manager actually gave him a \"secret tip\" on how to eat it (hint: Eat your burger 25% at a time). He mentioned how the flavors came together and was a very unique taste. He'd probably come back again for this before this limited time offer goes away."}
{"text":"THIS RED ROBIN FLIES ABOVE 3.5 STARS

   The Red Robin came to life in Seattle many years ago in 1969 as a gourmet burger restaurant. From that one restaurant, the Red Robin has flown across the American and Canadian landscape landing in several cities to take the casual dining customer under its wings. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, Red Robin has treated customers to an upbeat casual dining experience featuring a menu of gourmet burgers, specialty sandwiches, appetizing adult beverages, and dessert. In recent times, the Red Robin is soaring above some of its competition with thier bottomless fries. 

  Over twenty years have flown by since I last visited the Red Robin back in New York. I remember enjoying the food, but Long Islanders at the time did not take to the Red Robin causing it to relinquish it's space in the Smith Haven Mall to TGI Friday's. Twenty years later and last week, my brother and I were walking around the new-sprung Downtown Summerlin and took notice that a Red Robin is arriving the second week of November. So, yesterday after my brother and I left Floyd Lamb State Park (or Tulle Springs), it was in the top of my mind to have dinner in the Centennial Center Red Robin. And that is what we did. 

  When we walked into the relatively large waiting room, the attentive hostess let us know that there was a booth or table in the lounge, which is one of the two rooms in the restaurant, that she walked us to. The lounge features a bar and two large screen monitors that were at the time of the visit showing the NFL Green Bay verse Chicago game. At 9 P.M. on a Sunday the room was as quiet as a robin. 

  The pages of the menu displayed several burger sandwiches including the gourmet burger. My mind was set on fish and chips. These days I have been in the mood for fish and chips. Red Robin did not let me down. The three pieces of breaded fish had the right texture and crunch. The fish was the way I like it. I'd squeeze the lemons over the fish before dipping them in tarter sauce. But where was the Cole slaw? If there was that delicious Cole slaw that many restaurants serve with fish and chips, this red robin could of been flying above four stars. Where they scrimped on the Cole slaw, they were generous with the bottomless fries and Coke. Our easygoing waiter Landon was on the eight ball with the fries refills. He was kind enough to give us a portion to take home. The fries exceeded my expectations. In all honesty I thought they would be filler. The Red Robin bottomless fries is both quantity and quality. The fish and chips with bottomless Coke was worth $19 when you add in the upbeat atmosphere and good service. 

  Just like a red robin, the sky is the limit for the Las Vegas casual dining customer. The fact that I plan to return to Red Robin is testimony that they are doing something right. As I write this, a Red Robin is about to hatch in Downtown Summerlin by mid November. In a few weeks or less, I see a sequal Red Robin dining adventure in their newest location at Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday my burger was burnt taste like it was burnt to. Waitress seemed uneasy like she had II much on her plate. Sweet potato fries cold and I ordered the brownie to go got home half was normal the other half as hard as a rock. Totally disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had a friendly greeting and fantastic service! Loved the ambiance of the restaurant and of course the food. We were recommended a tropical zombie drinks-it felt like vacation in a cup. Glad we have a Red Robin close to home!!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the service!!!!  Burnin' Love is my all time favorite :) Bottomless Fries with ranch.....Yumm!!!"}
{"text":"4/26/15 on a slow Sunday, arrived at about 7:20 pm and left at 8p:05 pm with nothing but one round of drinks in us. Terrible service. Wasted our time completely with no remorse other than \"our ticket times are backed up\" but everyone else got their food and refills except us, the minority table. But their chefs are back there laughing and popping French fries in their mouth while we've been out of drinks and fries for half an hour."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and this was the worst service I've ever had. I had to ask for plates and napkins which you would think when ordering appetizers would be a common practice.  Never got our sides and soup was cold. Won't be coming back !!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in around 9-9:30 at night, they didn't close until 11. My family(of 7) stood in the front for a good 7-8 minutes. They were not in the least bit busy and multiple people looked our way and ignored us before someone FINALLY came over to greet us. When we got to our table, a guy took our drink orders and whatnot and told us our server would be over shortly. The server took a while to come by and throughout the entire visit we got very slow service, which didn't make sense seeing as how there were maybe four full tables in the entire restaurant. I'm giving this three stars bc my family thoroughly enjoyed our food and shakes. I was disappointed, seeing as how I hardly go here, I remember why I choose other places to eat."}
{"text":"Won't burger I have ever had ... They burned it ... No flavor !! That is why u need all the extras :)  service was not the best as well... Skip it!"}
{"text":"Red Robin. Yummm?? (Damn those are annoying commercials...) It's alright. For burgers that are unique and original I'd pick a different place. Some of their good points: they can boast of some great onion rings brought out in a towering stack, endless fries is always a selling point, burgers are sizable. However all that aside they're really just okay. Like I said, you can find more interesting burgers at plenty of other places. Their stuff is pretty standard. Grilled chicken sands, BLT burgers, Westerns with onion petals and BBQ sauce. You know, the usual. And the fact is, when you've eaten your fill on that burger and the first round of fries you really aren't going to want and additional servings of fries. Prices aren't bad though I think they've gone up a bit since my last visit long long ago. For location specifics I personally prefer the Red Robin further down WT Harris closer to the University area. Typically I'll go here because it's closer to home and I'm craving a change up. Also, the family tends to prefer knowing what it is they're gonna get when they place an order so we often end up at one of the chain wine/beer-n-dines."}
{"text":"Some times that place is soooo freaking loud.  The food is always consistent.  Not necessarily overwhelmingly good, but consistent.  Comparable to Fuddruckers, although I like Fudd's pickles better.  Fuddruckers changed their pickles so at best, it's a dead heat."}
{"text":"I feel like every time I go here I have a bad experience. I went with my boyfriend one evening and there was no employee at the podium to greet us or sit us. we stood there for about 10 minutes while employees walked by looking at us, they looked busy but how was nobody available to at least get our name down to be seated when available??? then another time I went in with my parents and the girl asked my dad if we needed a kid menu and I just stood there appalled. three adults walk in and say it's a party of three and she wants to know if we (I) need a kids menu. I have a full face of makeup, false lashes, lipstick, a ring on my finger, I'm blossomed pretty well, and she makes me feel like I'm a child. the staff and waiters are nice, but some of these experiences just make me not want to go here. not when I've been belittled and neglected. sorry red robin. the food is great though!"}
{"text":"This chain has quite the assortment of burgers and sandwiches. I signed up for their birthday club and I rarely come here outside of my birthday month when I receive a free burger. Their \"bottomless fries\" make for quite the challenge and it's fun to see just how many servings you can get through.  The only problem is that I've always had an issue with the servers coming back in a timely manner, so I rarely get my fill of fries before I reach the limits of my patience. 

They're making an effort to modernize their restaurant, so many functions such as ordering drinks, ordering appetizers, and paying for the tab can be done from a tablet posted at the table. This feels very impersonal at times and I would prefer to stick to the old-fashioned way of doing things but I can appreciate the attempt. 

With the many options here, I've been able to try something different each time and I've always been satisfied. Their drinks seems overpriced in relation to their food pricing, but I assume they have to make their money somehow."}
{"text":"I am giving this a high rating because our server was excellent. He was the gentleman working the bar about mid-day. He has a great personality and is all the more reason to return. The food was exceptional as well with the only down side being the second set of fries were not hot."}
{"text":"Today would be my third time ever eating at a Red Robins restaurant and like the other two times the food is not that good to me. The service was great though. But the next time I have a desire for a burger, Red Robins won't be on my list for food."}
{"text":"Very  nice greeter. But my waiter was slow.. helped others before peoe that were there first. I have a little one and they made him wait to eat with our burgers so he was pissed and freaking out because he was hungry. Just sucked thought i would try it again since it was about 7 years since last time... but still horrible. I wanted a normal cheeseburger but got a double with a mushy bun.. it sucked oh well wont be back."}
{"text":"Well as I sit here and wait for name to be called I get a text from the server that we have been taken off the list, so then I have to go back up there and let them know I'm still here and would like to still eat here. So 45 minutes later I get sat with my girlfriend and daughter. To only not see my waiter for another 30 minutes (it's my daughters treat for being a good girl at school) then this waiter shows up who looks like a crack head who's possibly still high to screw my order up. So I'm still sitting here waiting for my food, while listening to all of the staff behind us cursing loudly in front of my kid. I run a section in the United States Army reserves and I have never heard so many \"fucks\". And other shit now I can prob make any one of these kids cry but just a few lines I'm trying to be a better father and role model to my kid. Well I hope they clean this place up and train there employees better."}
{"text":"THIS ONE IS FOR THE OWNERS AND MANAGERS OF RR: For all the cute and fuzzy bunnies in the world, hire more employees! I can't judge your staff with negativity as they really are doing the best they can. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HIRE THEM SOME HELP!!!"}
{"text":"We love Red Robin.  They have the best burgers anywhere.  This location was no different.  My standard burger is usually the Banzai Burger.  However, this time I tried the Tavern taco burger.  It was amazing.  All their burgers come with unlimited fries.  My husband can't turn down their unlimited root beer floats.

The server was good but fairly new so we missed out on red robin points but that's okay.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I came for lunch during the week. Our Hostess was friendly and accommodating with where we wanted to sit. Our Server Emelie was awesome! She was friendly, attentive and brought us everything we needed to enjoy our meal. The food was good and very tasty. I had the Banzai burger and my Boyfriend had the Bleu Ribbon burger. We had a small issue with my Rewards card when it came time to pay our bill but Emelie handled it like a champ. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my updated review for this location. 1 star for the quick response to management for messaging me about my previous review and trying their best to fix my bad review. The service this time was good. The host quickly greeted us and food was tasty. Our server rachel asked me if I wanted my burger with some pink in it (which made me happy since that's how I always want my burger and my previous visit the server told me the meat is too thin and it's not possible). Overall I will give the return experience 3 stars since it was fast and the server was very polite. Only drawback was it seemed a little rushed probably due to the restaurant closing in an hour. I will try this place again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Red Robin and it pays to be a part of the rewards program since they love to send out special offers, free birthday burgers and rewards after a certain number of purchases.

You can never go wrong with bottomless fries, but every so often I TRY to opt for a healthier side option, ya know, like sweet potato fries ... okay, okay.. sometimes a salad, fruit or vegetables occasionally.

They remodeled it towards the 'upscale' side during the latter part of 2015 and it definitely has  a cooler, more 'adultified' feel.

The bar is okay, they have a few draft beer options, but a larger stock of the bottled type.

The fancy modern table-side tablet concept is interesting. Can probably be amazing if you don't like to talk to people - since you can basically order your drinks/meal, play games and pay your bill all on one magical machine. ( I don't mind dealing with a server ... unless they really suck at their job - which is always a dreaded reality of the service industry )

Paying your bill quickly - especially during shortened corporate lunch periods - can be a wonderful thing. Unless you have coupons, then unfortunately that will take a little longer.

YUMMM!"}
{"text":"Gourmet burgers? I must have been in the wrong restaurant because I did not see any. This place is decorated very nicely and festively. It looks like a nice place for kids to eat with all the statues of the bird, but the food left a lot to be desired. I had the mac and cheese with rib tips and my sister had the shrimp tacos. The shrimp tacos were very good. The shrimp were grilled to perfection and the cabbage added a nice crunch and the avocado mellowed every thing out. Now my mac and cheese on the other hand, I give 3 thumbs down. It was literally boiled pasta with no butter, milk or cheese with a drizzle of cheese like substance on top. I brought this to the waiters attention and he told me that that's how they make their mac and cheese. Smh. I returned the fail that they call mac and cheese and got shrimp tacos instead. Not sure if I'll ever return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sat for 45 minutes on a Thursday night and no food. It's changed. Everything has changed. They use to have good service and good food but now you can't even get the food to the table. I could understand if the restaurant was full but it wasn't. Somehow prices have increased and  services decreased. Sad because this use to be a go to place for my family."}
{"text":"The bottomless fries  are just that...from the bottom.  They haven't been good in a very long time.  Too many end pieces.  Either under or over cooked.  They need to use another vendor"}
{"text":"I just left here pretty excited to eat my burger and steamed broccoli. I get home with my to go order and the broccoli florettes  were disgustingly aged and brown. Not to mention there was a brown worm on one of them. I'm disgusted. I'm not sure why someone would cook aged brown broccoli and actually serve it to someone. I was going to give 2 stars, but after thinking to myself that someone looked at this and OKAY'D the decision to plate it, is amazing."}
{"text":"Pleasant evening on the patio with average good but a friendly waitress. They have malt vinegar for the fish and chips."}
{"text":"So when it comes to chains, I know the food is going to be...well, you know. It's going to taste like chain food. That's not always a bad thing. Sometimes you get craving for chain food like how you crave food from your childhood. (If you are me, this may mean you once ate 5 pieces of American cheese in a row, passing up the dill harvarti, but let's not judge.)

Having just moved back to Cleveland, I was driving past red robin and remembered how years ago I often used to get take out boca burgers at the bar. I figured what the heck and stopped in. Would you believe that the bar tender recognized me from all those years ago? She has a much better memory than I do, but I couldn't help but feel pleased that she actually remembered me.

Next, I placed a complicated, mildly annoying order, and it went with complete ease. Furthermore, there were no mistakes in my order when the food came out! For those wondering, I orders a gluten free bun, minus any meat or fake meat patties, with veggies, guacamole, and two types of cheese with a side of bottomless fries. 
I then enjoyed my meal, with sporadic friendly conversation from the awesome bar tender who made me feel so special. 

Yay red robin!"}
{"text":"My visit today was very disappointing. The hostess was able to greet and seat us right away, but I'm not sure if it was an assigned section. My family sat for a good 15 minutes before I noticed a manager pass by us with food and head back to the kitchen. I attempted to stop him to ask if we had a server before he hit the kitchen but his reaction was to look right at me then fly into the kitchen before I could get any words out. The hostess was no longer at the front so I awkwardly waited for a server to pass me as they were headed to the kitchen and ask if we could at least get a drink order in. She was sweet and very apologetic and let me know that she'd get someone right over. 
Worst part about having an open kitchen is being able to see the expo line where most restaurant employees love to hang out. Our table had the perfect view of that as we watched a few of them look at us and try to figure out which server would be waiting on us. What felt like another 10 minutes later someone showed up. At that point I asked if it was fine to go ahead and put in our food order as well. He said that would be okay so we started. I get that it was a Saturday lunch and that crowds of people were coming in and out, but I couldn't help but feel really rushed by him. Once he had a drink and entree order from each of us he flew out of there in the middle of my Aunt asking for a side sauce with her sandwich. We decided we could just wait for that once we received our food but once he came back with the drinks and we realized we were missing one my 9 year old cousin started to ask him if she could get her strawberry shake and he took off again. Sharing my water with her we decided to just hit the call server button to get his attention. I get that it's busy, but if we wanted to receive the shit service we received we would have just sat in a McDonald's dining room. This server looked right at us from the kitchen, even walked by to help another table, LOOKED at my little cousin with the flashing red light and kept walking. Once he came to walk by again three of us spoke up to get his attention with an \"excuse me\" to which he completely ignored to run to the kitchen to grab our food. As the food was being placed on the table we took it as our chance to get that last drink order in before he ran off again. Food was awesome, never any complaints there from Red Robin. Only thing was that I had asked for garlic parm fries and didn't receive them. Completely over the whole experience at that point I ate what I had and did not say anything. At the end when we were given the check I did a double check and noticed the up charge for the garlic fries. I let him know that I hadn't received them to which he said, \"oh right. You didn't. Do you want them now?\" As we're all ready to just pay and high tail it out of there. I asked him if he could just remove them off the bill and then we paid. 
As someone who has worked for Red Robin in the past along with the food industry for nearly 6 years now I am beside myself with how this entire experience played out. My family and I sat in that restaurant for nearly 2 hours watching people around us come and go. I'm flat out embarrassed even for the MOD to not realize the low quality service his/her staff presented us with today. As for Ray, the server - man, you gotta tighten up and get it together."}
{"text":"Service was alright. We received the check, but we weren't really done. Their fries were amazing so I'm satisfied. Very low selection of beer."}
{"text":"So this was my first time eating at Red Robin ever..... yes I said ever...... I was really excited to see that they had a mushroom burger on their menu! Not a lot of places have mushroom burgers so I was super excited to try it. When our food came out my burger was cooked to my specifications, but the taste of the burger and the mushrooms was very dull. I felt like there was no flavor or pizazz to the burger. With all the mushrooms, onions and cheese I figured this burger would be making my taste buds jump around. Instead it did the complete opposite. I ate a few bites and decided to just visit with my friend and munch on my fries. My fries were cold and kind of mushy. When I eat french fries, I like them crispy and warm. A lot of my friends love this place, so I will give it another try, just not a very good first impression. Maybe if I order something else I will have better luck! I usually try to give new places more than one shot just on that occasional off day we all have every now and then. :)"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, but when someone has the word \"gourmet\" in their name, I expect something fancy.  At Red Robin, they don't seem to get it.  Their burgers are, well, just burgers.  There isn't anything gourmet about the place.

You can get the same burger - or even a better burger - at plenty of places around town.  Not only is it not gourmet, it's not even really that good.  In fact, I'd probably rather have a burger from McDonald's.  Heck, I'd probably rather get a Chick-Fil-A than one of these things.  To make matters worse, they are horribly overpriced.

And if the food and price weren't bad enough, the service is bad.  Really bad.  We went one night when there was just about no one in the restaurant, and it took 15 minutes just to get a menu (15 minutes is my cutoff, and I was just about to walk out).  Then it took nearly 30 minutes to get our burgers.  By that point, I was so hungry that we just complained and ate the food.

No response whatsoever from the server or the management.  No apology, no free cheese (for which they charge extra, on top of the overpriced burger), no free dessert, nothing at all.  It's like we were troubling them for making their life more difficult.  Gourmet.  Ha!"}
{"text":"Normally I love Red Robin.  Normally I love the ambiance, the service,  and the food. This experience was very undesirable. The 1st waitress was rude. We were having issues with the game pad, and she was supposed to reset it so we could play the games.  That took awhile.  I had a party of 6 with me.  All of the fries were cold. And we were given an excuse as to why. Then my food came. There was some weird garlic on the side of my plate. No there wasn't anything garlic on my entree. Needless to say. Not a happy camper. Not a good experience. The manager tried to give us an explanation as to why. But still no bueno. I don't usually write of bad experiences,  but this was one for the books."}
{"text":"We've been to this location twice in the last six months. We have never had any issues even when the place was packed. Burgers have always been great and fries/root beer floats bottomless! We always leave stuffed and regretting eating sooo much. That's probably why Americans are so fat. BOTTOMLESS FOODS! I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"First review here (applause) thank you. There's a reason for it. To paraphrase Python, this is not a restaurant for enjoying. It's a restaurant for laying down and avoiding.

So Yelp may file this under robot or paid-shill category but here's proof: I've been to Red Robins before that were GOOD. That being said, even though this one is new, and you give a restaurant benefit of the doubt when they're new because some things aren't ironed out yet (the wait staff doesn't know all the details, orders come slowly, or whatever), this place had none of those issues. It was working like a well oiled machine. CLEARLY everyone from the front desk to the waiter had been schooled.  It's just that the \"schooling\" was done horribly wrong in this case. Seemingly not like other Red Robins. (Tho I admit it's been a few years since I've been to a different location)

Start with the minor beefs. (ha ha pun not intended) Front desk. \"Polite\" as in \"officious\". No welcome, just kind of a stare and a snide smile, as if they thought they were too good for everyone. They spend more time entering data into their little terminal so they can text you when your table is ready, than it would take to just jot it down on a piece of paper like a restaurant that isn't run by a machine. Then they wind up shouting out names anyway.

Get to the table and the waiter comes back every minute to see if we are ready to order. Already getting the vibe that they are trying to turn tables as quickly as possible -even though there are plenty of tables with no one at them.  And a (less than predicted) 20 minute wait to get to a table when there were plenty free, even though we were told there was nowhere we could sit while we waited for a table to become available.

Our waiter offered burgers done with \"some pink\" or \"no pink\" or something along those lines. I've never heard this terminology. Trying to be clever and invent something new just for the sake of being different, when something different isn't needed? At least he understood when I said \"well done\".

We had a question about the sizes of milkshakes. Perhaps there was a regular & \"monster size\". The waiter was clearly prepped for that question because he enthusiastically answered \"For only a dollar more you get TWICE AS MUCH!\". Let's nip that in the bud right now.  The \"twice as much\" milkshake is LESS than you get at Steak & Shake or Courier Cafe.  If there is a milkshake that's actually half that size, it would fit in a juice glass, 8 ouncer easily. What a joke.

So the burgers come and we were with a couple that likes to say a quick grace before they eat. No worries. Bad habit #2 of our waiter revealed: he consistently comes to the table and disregarding whatever conversation (or prayer) might be going on simultaneously, or even waiting for a pause, just shouts down the conversation with whatever he wants to get through. He did apologize for interrupting but really is it that hard to notice when everyone has their heads down? That would be a recurring pattern throughout the time we were there. Someone would be mid-sentence and he would just barge over them, interrupting whatever they were saying to ask if everything was \"okay\". Yes, go away, a good waiter will just pass by regularly to make their presence known so you can flag them down, maybe check in once. A REALLY good waiter you won't even notice, but they will NOTICE when something needs attention just based on signals they pick up. That level of expert service is not expected here. What IS expected is a polite pause so we can finish a sentence to recognize him vs. being interrupted.

Getting back to the food itself, burgers were fine, the major gripe we had was the \"bottomless\" fries and broccoli. (The only other thing we got besides the MONSTER shake) They are called bottomless because literally they come in a small round piece of metal, like a cylinder, but it has no bottom. The bottom is the tray it sits on. So you just pick up the metal and the fries come out.  And there aren't that many of them. Like VERY FEW.  And unfortunately when we asked for more (both fries AND broccoli) they showed up long after our meal was done. We figured they actually forgot about them it took so long.

OK I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going on this before Yelp cuts me off. The cap on the waiter story is at the end when he's walking you through how to use the wireless terminal at your table to pay for the meal (which for some reason couldn't print a receipt despite having paper) he tells you that the machine is going to give you a survey, and LITERALLY word for word he tells you he needs you to give him 9's or 10's, or else he wants you to talk to him first. Awful fancy request.

I'll wrap with a list of burgers in town that we could have had that would have been a way better experience: Meatheads! Five Guys! Steak n Shake! Courier! Wendy's, McDonald's, Po Boy's, BK, DQ...don't go for hype people. Red Robin is a tourist trap. Sorry RR. :td:"}
{"text":"Typical Red Robin, slow service. We sat at our table for at least 10 mins before our waitress came over to get our drink Oder and then our food took 40-45 mins to come out; they were not very busy. All this is pretty much what I expect when I go to any Red Robin, some reason they are always slow. 
What was really disgusting was the manager Katie came walking out of the kitchen with a mouth FULL of food pushing out a cart of glasses, wiped her mouth while continuing to chew and then without washing or using hand sanitizer she proceeded to empty the glass rack. If that is what a manger is doing imagine what the cooks/wait staff are doing  Too bad the health inspector wasn't there today bc I'm pretty sure that is a FAIL. Next time I'll go to BJ's or even Chili's."}
{"text":"Our waitress was really nice. The environment and decor was pretty cool. I ordered the Madlove burger and it was delicious. $15 for a burger is a bit much though."}
{"text":"The burger is very good, I had a sir atcha. Beers and the weather outside is great! Bottomless fries even better!!!!"}
{"text":"Cold fries and bottomless drinks that took 35 minutes to get one refill sums up my experience with this Red Robin location. For a place that stays pretty busy, there is no excuse for cold food being brought to the table. And when I let the waitress know about it she didn't apologize, she just took it to the back and 15 minutes later brought out another batch which of course arrived after we had ate almost everything else. 

2 Stars. Every time I step foot in this particular location it's been a bad experience and not up to the standards I've experienced at other Red Robin locations here in Las Vegas, Colorado, and Missouri."}
{"text":"Have you ever been happy just to get the heck out of somewhere? I had that feeling tonight at Red Robin. My wife was craving a loaded cheeseburger so along with my 2 year old off we went. Being a Friday night the parking lot was almost full, my wife and I took the last two open spaces as she met us there. Once we stepped inside things went South. Rather than write war and peace let's just drop the facts: 

1: They called that iced tea? 
2: You quit carrying spinach and artichoke dip? WTF? 
3: The Mushrooms / Zucchini appetizer picture had to be Photoshopped. What we got, well the mushrooms were edible. The zucchini was, well, ugh!
4: Normally the Fish and Chips are good. I've had them in Kansas City, Denver, and Vegas. Tonight's batch failed. Blah, boring, undercooked. Why mince words, it sucked. 
5: I asked for malt vinegar sauce. 3 requests later someone finally gets it. 
6: I would like my steak fries to be warm, preferably when they come to the table I want them hot enough when served that I don't want to keep my fingers on them for long. What I got made me wonder if the cook was celebrating 4/20 prior to coming to work. 
7: 1.19 for two lame little bitty slices of avacado that looked like it was on it's last legs? Really? Pathetic. 
8: My 2 year old thought the mac and cheese sucked. He ate two bites, thankfully the orange they served with it was good as that's all he ate. And it's hard to make kids food suck but they rose to the occasion. 
9: On the way out we had to walk past a bunch of servers and a manager who wouldn't clear a path and they were talking about a large party that came in. The manager said and I quote \"I don't know where in the f*** to sit them, either they wait or they can sit on the damn floor\". 

Needless to say I was happy to leave. Thankfully the Cupcakery that shares the same parking lot was still open to provide some sustenance that actually tasted good.  

On my way home the way my stomach feels it made me wonder if I might need some Syrup of Ipecac before the night's over. 

2 Stars: Our server was overworked but tried his best. And 1 star goes for the TV's that let me see the end of the Giants / Mets game."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second chance after the GM reaching out to me. He seemed very concerned with the whole issue and wanted me to have a better experience. 

Sat in the bar area and service was really good. My husband got the buffalo chicken sandwich and really liked it. Had a good flavor to it but not too spicy. I got the burnin love burger and thought it was delicious. 

Overall, the experience was much better than my last visit even though it was a to go order and this time I actually dined in."}
{"text":"This was NOT a positive Red Robin experience and I'm quite disappointed!  This was our first visit to this particular location and likely our last.  The service was just okay...we started with one server and then another server mysteriously showed up and explained that our other server was too busy. Oh, okay.  The first server didn't bother to give the second one our rewards number and the second one was less than efficient, let's just say.  But that's not really the biggest complaint.  It was FREEZING cold at our table, which is not something we Arizonans often complain about, but this was ridiculous...teeth chattering cold!  We asked three times for something to be done about the temperature to no avail.  We were right under a fan and were told it couldn't be turned off.  Someone (a manager maybe?) told us that he turned it up from 73 to 74 but that was the best he could do.  So, being extremely uncomfortable and dealing with slow service will have me spending my money elsewhere in the future.  So disappointed with this Red Robin!"}
{"text":"Alex is a fantastic server!  She is the reason for this five-star review.  Personable, engaging, knowledgeable, and efficient - those all describe Alex and the service we received from Alex.  Generally this is a well-maintained and nice Red Robin (can't say that for all of them).  We are usually greeted immediately and there's never too long of a wait to be seated. Food is good and quality is consistent from visit to visit."}
{"text":"I so wanted to go to this place and it did not disappoint at all.We had a great time. I had crispy chicken burger and my wife had chicken teriyaki burger and to top it we had bottomless coke and garlic fries wwoooooo. The food was yummy. Would surely visit again cheers."}
{"text":"It's been a LONG time since I've been to one and I wasn't expecting too much since the only thing I recalled was liking the lemonade and bottomless fries. Anyway, Ruben and I met up with a couple of friends on a busy Sunday afternoon. They were thoughtful enough to mention to our server that I would be looking for Vegetarian eats, so I was given the allergy binder (yeah, no information for Vegetarians, just FYI).

I ordered the Bacon Guacamole Burger with a substitution of a Gardenburger® and removed the bacon and mayo. I did indulge in the bottomless fries, but was really disappointed that you're given less than ten fries to start. Seriously? I know it's unlimited, but give people a nice amount and maybe you won't have multiple orders of more fries. Our server was really great though and I asked her to bring us more as soon as we got our orders (this took a while, but like I mentioned, it was busy). I liked the Gardenburger® (first time trying it, but I had done research between this and Boca Burgers; I like the idea of vegetables in a patty form rather than soy meat) and the guacamole was okay. There was barely any flavor and the vegetables were blah (the shredded lettuce was sad). The bun was all right, a tad dry. Overall, not pleased. The fries were disappointing too! I remember them being so much better too. I know they're probably just from a frozen bag, but it was not cooked well (WAY too oily) and the Red Robin Seasoning I remember enjoying was just meh too. Anyway, I thought maybe I didn't enjoy my burger since it was a \"healthy\" version, however, I took a bite of Ruben's Burnin' Love Burger and it was just okay. He, not being as picky as I am, thought everything was just okay as well.

My verdict? That was my last time dining there. Nothing phenomenal and with so many awesome burger joints in the valley, you can absolutely get something more for your money (and for just a couple dollars more).

Notes: this location is in Galleria Mall near the front, main entrance off Sunset."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my brother gave me another gift card for this restaurant, so i ended up giving it another shot. The Actual Red Robin burger is fairly decent taste wise. The service at this location particularly is awful. Hope you like being ignored. There seems to be no leadership or commitment to customer service. Enjoy your bottomless fries if you can find someone. The employees at this location hate that they may have to give you a refill of the 10 bottomless fries they give you. I will tell you that ive never left a bad review for a business other than this place, twice. If you really llike this place, then go to a different location. They will ruin it for you."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, our party of four had an experience here that brought new meaning to the word \"pathetic\".  Upon receiving our menus, we asked for a copy of the dietary guide.  Seven minutes later, when asked when it was coming, our waitress replied, \"Oh, just a few more minutes.\"  I complained to the manager that this was totally unacceptable, and he assured me it would be at the table forthwith.  The waitress showed up with her version of the dietary guide...a list of  the calories in the desserts.  She obviously had no idea what it was. Totally useless.  We had one person in the party who is extremely sensitive to salt.  That's all we needed, the sodium information.  Finally, the manager brought it to us.  The waitress seemed to have nothing but problems in taking our orders (uh, we were not that difficult a party, believe me), and we were assured that one of us could have burger and fries without the salt.  Well, three of the orders came out.  The saltless order did not.  We AGAIN spoke to the manager, who mentioned that the kitchen screwed it up, and she jumped in the line and made it herself for us...however, this was 10 minutes after the rest of the food had arrived. Let me sum up the rest of the evening...the manager again apologized and said we would not be charged for the meal.  Uh, we WERE charged for it, so we again complained.  What a horrible evening, truly.  The combined, almost concerted ineptness of the staff truly helped to ensure a negative experience.  We will never, ever set foot in a Red Robin again.  Ever."}
{"text":"Love their menu options...everything is always good. 
I really enjoy the garden burger option & low-carb lettuce wrapping option. 
It was Sunday & packed of course but we got seats at the bar. We received excellent customer service from Carlos (98% sure that was his name) but the other bartender seemed irritable with how busy it was & he didn't really want to be there.. 
Red Robin doesn't really ever let us down-- Red Robin, YUMM"}
{"text":"Our visit today wasn't that good. The colossus burger was soggy and tasteless.  The Bleu burger was warm at best. The waiter explained that they use a conveyor belt to cook the burgers. I thought that they had a cook in back cooking them. I found it a little odd that the waiter sat down at our booth to take our order. Overall it was at best 2 stars.  I frequent a Red Robin near my work.  They are much better. We probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I love burgers, but everytime I eat here, I fill up so fast and the burgers never sit right. They are tasty but they just don't sit right for some reason. Endless french fries could be the problem. I'll skip the steak fries and trow down another burger and see how that goes.

Always good service."}
{"text":"After contacting the company about my experience, I received a followup call from the manager Paul.  Not only was he very nice and professional, he didn't make any excuses and agreed that the service the night we were there was very lacking in the restaurant.  He offered a gift card to return and experience the restaurant again.  I appreciate when a company not only fixes their mistakes, but does it in a very honest and non-excuse making manner."}
{"text":"Ive been to Red Robbin many times used to be a long wait today we walked right in after 1pm , a few times Ive been during lunch no wait. Im surprised this Red Robbin is still open  just as the past few times Ive been not busy so the servers should be on top of things. First our burgers were good however I had to ask the server 3 times for a to go box the fourth time I asked I believe the mgr not sure.  Finally got a box , I had a coupon for a milk shake , that was the worst milk shake Ive ever had , McDonald's makes a better shake an cheaper Do not get a Milk shake. It was milk with some crumbled cookies in it yuck!!!  I also work in Ballantyne an we get the Ballantyne corp discount card an today they said they no longer take it mm odd they've taken it for 5 years.  Cant say Ill go back anymore , Duckworths  an Bad Daddys is around the corner great burgers an service ."}
{"text":"I like Red Robin. 

There, I said it. I've never had a bad waiter experience and the food has always been just what I've expected. 

Big ups to this location though. My group made a reservation for 60 people for lunch yesterday. I called an hour or so before our time to ask if it was cool if we came in a little early, and apparently there was a mix-up with the days because they thought we were coming in the following day. What could have been a huge disaster was not because they quickly accommodated us and after about a 5-minute wait we were all seated in the dining area. They had no problem splitting checks, our food came out at a reasonable time, drinks were filled, great experience."}
{"text":"I've tried just about every burger on the menu and each one was amazing. You cant go wrong ordering food here. Not quite 5 stars, but close."}
{"text":"Had guacamole bacon burger.  Bottomless fries.  Arnold Palmer.  Service was great even when we went at 8:38 when they close at 9. Food was good. Wish they had more choices on how the burger is cooked (medium rare)  but little pink was really good still. Will eat here agian"}
{"text":"My friend loves the hamburgers and endless fries. Service was very good both times that we have been there.  Location is great for a quick meet-up."}
{"text":"Went for a date night, and the burger and fries were so good. Probably the best burger that I've ever had... I was wearing long sleeves and I actually had to roll the sleeves up. Everything was perfect... we had a couple of drinks and the atmosphere was great.
Those two meals and a total of four drinks added up very quickly though, so make sure you bring a decent amount of $$$ with you. It's been about 9 or so years since I've been to a Red Robin and I don't remember them being so pricey, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Never been really a fan of this place. Ordered a salad and it was extremely fatty tasting. The service was extremely poor. Enjoyed the time that I was there, but overall just a typical chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Omg I love their burgers and especially their fries. I love how you can get a refill on fries. Their barbecue chicken sandwich is so good. Most of all the customer service was good, very attentive. Even their alcohol beverages are good. This place is one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Went during lunch one day with coworkers.  Decent burger, ok fries. Nothing special really, but my bill was only $8."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on 12/30/16 and got seated , got our drinks served to us , and the server Kameya warned us she was gonna be with us in a minute. UHHHH , its been 5 minutes we waited , I know it's not long but um don't come to the table and say you were in the office talking to the manager because they screwed up on you're schedule ! It's not our fault that your schedule was messed up. Be professional next time and keep that to yourself. I work in a restaurant industry as well and you should be putting that on the side for YOURE time not when you have customers like us waiting for our order to be taken. 

Service just sucked as of right now I'll try to enjoy my food while she probably continues checking her messed up schedule."}
{"text":"Deliciousness -4/5
Happiness 5/5

What can I say, I'm a fan of what Red Robin does. The burgers taste pretty good and they are constantly putting new types of burgers on the menu. Chicken, fish, turkey, and of course, beef. And I love steak fries, which can now be paired with various aiolis and sauces (for which I am a total sucker). Decent beer selection and decent price. And boy do I love those bottomless fries (and usually add a side of steamed broccoli to keep up the illusion of happiness).

Is this the healthiest dining place in the world? Absolutely not. But do you just want a burger with bottomless fries sometimes? Yes. 

As for this location, it's pretty great. Quick, clean, and quiet. They welcome kids with open arms, which is a plus to me."}
{"text":"I had not eaten at Red Robin in a while and then ended up there 2 times in a week's time. My first visit I ordered Ensanada Chicken. I ordered black beans as my side. You have the option of ordering one or 2 pieces of chicken. I got 2 thinking I would take one home for leftovers. Well, it was so good that I ate both pieces of chicken. The beans were really tasty too. 
The second visit I got a burger with blue cheese, steak sauce, and onion straws. I ordered it Medium. I ordered Cole slaw as my side. The burger was cooked exactly as I requested it. I liked the coleslaw and found out it's \"endless\" like their fries are. That's a great deal. I don't know anywhere else that offers endless sides. 
Both times the servers were kind and did a nice job. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had not eaten at Red Robin for a year. Their quality of food seemed to go downhill. This past Sunday my oldest son and I decided to give it a try. 
The first thing we noticed was that the entrance had been redone and had more seating. I also noticed that their tag line is \"Burgers and Brew\" which is a good since Craft beers are what people are looking for these days. 
We were seated in the bar area. It also had been remodeled. I loved the huge lighting fixture made from beer bottles. 
I ordered a Cobb Salad with no tomatoes. It was supposed to come with Garlic Toast. The salad was good but the piece of chicken was small. It looked like a lunch portion not a dinner portion. The 2 pieces of Garlic Toast were the size of bread you use for Brushetta.  That was disappointing. 
My son ordered a Royal Burger with fries. He enjoyed his burger and asked for a refill of fries.  Our server was friendly and attentive. 
Their food is better and I will probably eat there again but with all of the choices there are it doesn't get the rank of a Favorite."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Great food, service, and clean. Last week it was the worst! The restrooms were filthy, and as we know that is a reflection of the kitchen. I should have left, but my kids really wanted to eat there, so we stayed. The waitress was good but the kitchen dropped the ball taking forever to get the food out, which made some of it cold by the time we got it. The restaurant was not even half full!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile. I remember it being better. I had the Royal Robin burger and it was about average. Fries were okay. Decent seasoning. My 14yo had the fish and chips which he enjoyed. I had a bite of his fish and thought it was pretty good. My husband ordered the nacho burger and we are pretty sure he did not actually receive the nacho burger. Shame on us I guess for not saying something, but it ended up being okay, whatever kind of burger it was.

When \"and brews\" is on your sign, I guess I'm expecting some better options. Very few, what I would consider craft, options on draft. Had some okay craft bottle options, but not many. I don't think their beer menu is much more than it was when they didn't have \"and brews\" on the sign. 

Overall it was okay, but there are so many better options in Madison, I think we'll check those out instead from now on."}
{"text":"At RR now. Watching staff use bare hands to put lemons into drinks, including my ice tea. Placed my drink at the edge of the table and waiting for a new drink."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to visit this Red Robin ready for some burgers and football watching! The location was very busy (around 8:30 PM on a Saturday night) but we were seated within 5-10 minutes.

Our server was friendly and helpful, and we were able to watch several football games on different TVs while we waited for our food. The only reason this review gets four stars instead of five is because we waited a pretty long time. When the food came out, I realized I had ordered the wrong burger entirely (my mistake!) and they immediately offered it to replace it for me for free. Thank you Red Robin!

Another thing I liked about this location is the little iPads at every table. You can either pay $1.99 to play trivia games throughout your meal (no thanks!) or pay right at the iPad by credit or debit card instead of waiting for your bill (yes please!). 

I'll visit again."}

{"text":"Great experience ! Great food, service. Server was friendly and quick and the food was done right. Celebrated with a free sundae - manager was great!"}
{"text":"We go to red Robin frequently but we have never had an  experience turn out the way it did. First off, we wanted 2 different fries, one regular and one parmesan.  We were told that it's only one bottomless friends per 4 people therefore the 2 of us couldn't have that. .. But at any other Red Robin it's fine.  The fries they brought out were barely warm, you could tell they were left under the heat lamp. We ordered mushrooms and mozzarella sticks, the mozzarella sticks were good but the mushrooms weren't cooked right, and the breading on them were gross. Our basket was filled with sauce and then covered with mushrooms to hide that they spilt sauce.  The \"nacho cheese\" for the burger was disgusting and cold, when you think nachos, you don't think cold sauce. The burger didn't taste good either and usually they are fine. For some reason this Red Robin isn't good. I don't recommend going to this one, save your money."}
{"text":"Each time i visit this place it gets worse. Food has always been just OK as well as the service. This time was probably that last chance I can give it a shot. We were seated quickly, the waiter introduced himself & brought us our beverages but then my boyfriend had gone to the bathroom and come back already (and waited) by the time a waiter came back to check on our menu choices. It turned out our waiter was also serving as the bartender but also not very attentive or even that busy. 
Our appetizer  choice was chips salsa & guac. Our mistake from expecting them to be good considering its a marketed burger joint. But really it should be taken off the menu. 
a heaping pile of crappy chips, with a tiny size dipping cup of what HAD to be canned diced tomatoes. Really. I am not joking or exaggerating. The tiny side of guac was brownish. 
We asked them to take them back. And ordered wings. They were good but took forever coming out. 
We ordered burgers, they were good. But then not only had we finished eating, we sat about 10 minutes before I walked up to the waiter who not only was within plain sight from us and a few feet away and asked for our check. 
Bad food and slow service...never again"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a girlfriend for dinner. It was pretty busy in there. Our server was Alisha and she was very prompt efficient friendly and helpful in deciding. 
My girlfriend and I are from Philly so we are soft pretzel fans, which of course meant we had to get the pretzel bites for an appetizer. They were decent. But the cheese dipping sauce was weird. Had a sweet taste and tasted watered down. They definitely should change the \"cheese\" they use. I went wayyyy off my diet and had some big burger with an egg on it. It was messy but seriously one of the best burgers Ive had. The steak fries were good but woulda been so much more delicious with a good cheese sauce."}
{"text":"Just terrible food and sad service. Our server was probably new to the job and didn't know the menu very well. My burger was soggy, the bun almost disintegrated and the patty was very thin. Couldn't even finish my food it was all around a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Regular retail price $27. Paid $13. Joined the Red Robin email club and they sent me a free meal on my birthday, I also used coupon code YUMMM21 to get 21% off of my online to go order. Had to do two transactions but I loved this deal because it's one of the few that allowed to go orders. The bartender was lightening fast to check on my order when I arrived and she entered my rewards number to take my birthday burger off my price. To go orders also come with a fresh HOT wedge fry cup so you aren't tempted to \"tax\" your roommate's meal on the way back home"}
{"text":"Writing my initial review from the lobby. I'm sitting on the bench inside waiting for a friend/waiting for a table. Stood by the host desk for a few minutes, no one came up. I've now been sitting here for 8 minutes and 4 employees have passed me. Not one has asked if I need something.
Hopefully the burgers at this location is good."}
{"text":"Well went there on a Sunday evening are waitress Shelley was nowhere to be found at first we sat there for 10 minutes than she greeted us than we waiting 10 minutes for our  drink order so waiting for our drinks turn on the waitress light on 5 minute later she came we kept seeing her sit at a table talking when everyone around us was being sitted and taken care of before us after us being there longer i have never had a bad experience at red robin till tonight"}

{"text":"Red Robin. I had never been at night, only during the day. Pleasant surprise.
Friendly service, just a little slow. The Skinny Margarita is tasty. Good beer selection.
The Gourmet  Burgers are good. I had one of the new ones with bacon, and the Angus was tasty. Asked to substitute a side salad for the fries... No problem.
Again, this location has friendly folks, great service and darn good food for a Red Robin!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Red Robin a couple times before and always had a very slow experience. My waiter's name was Ralf and he was extremely forgetful. I ordered a cheeseburger plain with pickles on the side and I had to ask for the pickles twice after receiving my burger. My group also ordered chips and salsa/guac as an appetizer.  While ordering, I asked if it was possible to have it cut in half (I was told mini burgers were no longer served) and he said it would be no problem. My girlfriend ordered the Royal Robin burger and requested ranch and thousand island on the side. 

He finally surfaced with our food 25 minutes later and our appetizer.  I don't think he understood the concept of an appetizer...it was chips and pre-made dips it really should have came out shortly after ordering. I didn't get the pickles I wanted on the side nor did we receive the ranch and thousand island dressings per my girlfriend's request. My burger wasn't cut in half which would not have been a big deal except Ralf never gave us any silverware or napkins. We had to wait around until Ralf came out of wherever he was hiding to get silverware. Thankfully I had a bunch of napkins in my bag, so we just used those. Also, our drinks were often empty and Ralf would be, once again, no where in sight.  Very disappointing service and I don't think we'll be back especially at the high price tag. The host was pretending to answer the phone and texting on her cell phone behind the podium during the entirety of our visit. Also, when you go to the bathroom you can see into the kitchen and there were so many waiters/waitresses just standing around.  With the slow service we had there should have been no one standing around whatsoever especially since it wasn't busy in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst Red Robin Gourmet Burgers I've ever been to! Rudest waitress ever! She gave me boneless buffalo wings PLAIN WITHOUT BEING TOSSED IN SAUCE! We ordered mozzarella sticks because my child wanted some. Needless to say they never came. The waitress we had never came by to check on us and the manager became our server and actually apologized. Our original waitress never came by to apologize. This is the third time we have had problems at this location. I will never be coming back because of all these problems. Get better staff who actually care about their customers."}
{"text":"Meh. The fries were very good. It's supposed to be unlimited but you will be hard pressed to be able to have them come fill up your glass with a second cup of water. So the unlimited fries is basically 1 refill because they take forever to refill, as in 20-30 minutes. The little red blinking light to summon your server is a farce. I turned it off after 15-20 minutes.

Burgers are ok. We all ordered pink in the middle since the waiter asked. No one in our group of 3 received it pink. I got the BBQ burger which was made of bacon, patty, and some other accoutrements I can't think of. Pretty much every burger had bacon in it. Bacon is usually a filler when they cannot make it tasty using other ingredients IMO. I think avocado, or grilled onions would've made this gourmet-ish but bacon is just meh for me. Five guys burger is tastier is the verdict.

I would say the server sucked but he was busy serving others and not standing around so I am going to assume the Galleria Mall RR is understaffed due to personnel shortfalls."}
{"text":"D'vonte was the shit! This dude is super helpful and really fun! He knows te menus and recommended a great burger. Super nice and carries great conversation! He very detail oriented and makes me definitely come back! Thanks Man! You are the reason we will come back to this location. (Girl in the front, not so nice) but she don't have to."}
{"text":"Still awesome service and great food. A few issues in some previous visits don't appear to be an issue.. Another fun time."}
{"text":"Great burgers and their fresh bottomless fries... I love how this place offers so many different varieties of burgers- they don't ONLY serve burgers but salads, sandwiches and so much more!

I got a Banzai burger which had a slice of pineapple and teriyaki sauce, and hubs got a Madlove burger. His burger was seriously delish- just like the name, \"Madlove\" it really was. It's got cheddar and Parmesan crisp on top of provolone and Swiss, then they add jalapeño, bacon, avocado, tomato red onions and lettuce. How can this burger go wrong with all the heavenly ingredients on it?! It was so so good and cooked perfect medium. I've been a huge fan of their banzai burger hut after this visit, I think it's fair to say this Madlove burger has taken over the most favorite spot! 

Kids menu options are great, reasonably priced as well.

Overall, We had a very pleasant visit :)"}
{"text":"Bad experience. Won't ever go back to this location.

1) The hostess seats us and all she says to us is let me know if you have any concerns... I automatically said should I be concerned? jokingly. She didn't say anything and walked away. I mean who says that when your first seating customers to eat? Red Flag!!

2) Our waitress only came to our table once to get our drink order/food order. What's the point of offering bottomless fries if you can't order more? She wasn't anywhere is sight to even call her over.

3) Bathroom was dirty and hadn't been cleaned in a while with trash all over the floor, also no toilet paper at all."}
{"text":"Love Red Robin...just not this one.  Worst service I have had at any Red Robin.  We were there on a Monday night when it was not busy at all.  Our server was just plain slow.  Not sure what she was doing but we waited and waited to get anything from her.  Our drinks ran out several times.  Food was ok, my burger was over cooked.  It was well done instead of medium.  When we went to pay the server took our card and proceeded to take other orders before ever even running our card.  So once again we waited and waited.  She was standing at the bar after that and then finally went back by the kitchen got some drinks for another table and finally brought our card back...nearly fifteen minutes later.  No exaggeration. I will choose another Red Robin next time."}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing experience. Had Jacqueline as our service very attentive to the table always had a new refill before my glass was empty. The food tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch before going to a movie. I ordered a bowl of clam chowder and iced tea. The soup was horrible. It was gritty, not creamy. So, I sent it back and ordered a bowl of chili. It was cold and I sent it back. Too late to try something else because of the movie.  They actually brought me a bill for the tea which I refused to pay.  This particular establishment needs to have the chefs go to soup making school!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. It's McDonald's plus 30% price increase.  Want a good burger,  plenty of other places around."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went there this weekend, we ordered appetizers, two burgers, and drinks. We got the orange crush dream drink, that we never even got offered a refill on, nor were we offered a refill on my tea. We were also supposed to be served bottomless fries which we did not get, and we even paid extra for the garlic fries, but no one ever came to check on us at our table. Once we were clearly done, and all of our plates for organizing the corner of our cable, I then saw the waitress service at least five other people before she even got twice to check out. And that was after we push the red button. I really love red Robin, but this experience, it was just absolutely unacceptable. Horrible service."}
{"text":"This was my very 1st time here. I have to say I did enjoy everything. The food was great but the service was crap. I would go back as long as I could have a different server.

For starters, I ordered a chili cheeseburger and bottomless fries and my friend order a bacon cheeseburger with the bottomless fries. The burger was good but messy, that's expected with a chili burger though. I liked the flavor of the burger and the chili. My friend enjoyed her burger too.

The fries could have had more seasoning but it was nothing the house seasoning salt mixture couldn't fix. I like the bottomless fries idea. They were hot and fresh and the just kept coming and coming.

We didn't order an appetizer because there was too much to choose from. The waitress asked if we wanted some fries while we waited. That was cool! I much rather have fries over bread.

Now back to the beginning, the waitress took forever to get to us. She walked past use multiple times and most times she didn't make Eye contact. She kept saying, one moment guys. This was even before we ordered drinks.

After about 10 minutes, she came over and took our drink order. She then left again. She came back after just a couple minutes and dropped off our drinks. We were ready to order, but she said, \"one minute guys.\" She kept passing us over and over. She was taking orders for other tables. Then she put their orders in and came back to us.

She asked if we wanted appetizers. We told said, \"No\" and then she asked if we just wanted some fries. We said, \"yes\" to the fries and it only took a couple minutes to get them. She sat them down and was off again. She came back after 3 or 4 minutes and thanked us for our patients.

We ordered and it took us maybe 7 or 8 minutes to get our burgers. We wanted more fries within that timeframe, but the waitress went missing again. We just had to wait until the food came out. It took us like 12-15 minutes to eat and she didn't stop by not one time.

I thought I was being smart when I used the machine thingy on the table to request that the waitress stop by. I felt so stupid when she passed us time after time, even though the red light was flashing on the machine. Also, while waiting, we decided to order some dessert. I ordered using the machine, since the waitress was no where to be found.

She finally stopped by. I asked if I had ordered correctly and she looked through the machine, turned off the blinking light and told me yes, my dessert order was in. I asked for more fries at that time, and I didn't see her again until she brought the fries and dessert out, at the same time, it took maybe 6 minutes. We finished everything and got the hell out of there.

Like I mentioned before. The food was good, but the service was hell.

Fix it Red Robin!!!"}
{"text":"We received a gift card and have never tried Red Robin so we finally gave it a go.  My burger was amazing, great flavor and this is definitely a go-to place for a great burger.  I also like that you can substitute a salad instead of fries for no upcharge.  I don't eat salad but my mother was happy about that. The biggest plus for me was that they had Minute Maid Light on their menu so I was able to get a 10 calorie lemonade with Peach or Raspberry flavor.  I had both and recommend the peach lemonade but both were good.  Those things aside, the chicken and shrimp combo left something to be desired.  You only got two chicken strips and six shrimp for $12.00+ and my husband was not impressed.  He was expecting more food for the money.  The bottomless steak fries are okay but not my favorite restaurant fries.  I got them with garlic & herbs and it made them more exciting but $0.99 for some seasoning seemed a little steep.  My extra cheese was a $0.99 upcharge as well.  We had the stack of onion rings and they were pretty good - typical of any restaurant.  Overall this place was good but it wasn't phenomenal.  I would go here again if friends were going or for a great burger.  Red Robin has the burger department nailed."}
{"text":"The restaurant is okay. Not the best burgers but definitely make up for the bottomless steak fries. They are always busy in the weekends with families with children. The price is average. The most recent time I had gone, the service was good and he waitress was always checking on us. The other times was not the best considering the servers were too busy. The milkshakes are awesome and the main reason why I come."}
{"text":"This Red Robin is the first location in the C-U area. I've visited Red Robin restaurants in Washington, Oregon, and Wisconsin. The location here must be a new format as it is considerably smaller than other places usually have. However, the menu is the same and has a variety of items to satisfy most tastes. Burgers, sandwiches, and salads dominate the choices but there are a few entrees as well. Food and service are both of a standard quality so I have no complaints. While not fine dining, the experience is good and is an \"OK\" choice for dining late."}
{"text":"Good place for a hamburger.  Root beer floats were tasty and bottomless and great service.  Will return!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and decent food. Service was a little slow, but not enough to complain about. I asked for a well done burger and got a burnt burger instead, but with enough mustard anything goes down better. I could eat the fries every day for the rest of ever. Not dying to come back, but I wouldn't refuse to go back either."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service!!!
Thanks Matthew!!! I'll be back for sure. 

It's a rare find these days to find a place with great service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location did not seem to have it together. I will start off by saying that our server was very attentive and friendly, so that was appreciated. I am used to the Happy Valley location and was expecting the same food/drink. I ordered the jalapenorita which says it comes with fresh jalapeño slivers...it did not and I had to ask for them. I ordered the garlic herb fries and they looked nothing like the Happy Valley location...there was hardly any garlic and not one herb. We had two small  combined tables (for 3 people) and my side of the table was so wobbly that it made it very uncomfortable. Oh yes, my mothers salad came with garlic toast, but it was so burned it did not taste normal. I'll be going to the Happy Valley location in the future."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. The service was great and the food was delicious. The restaurant was clean and tidy. I would come back. Our server was nice and delightful."}
{"text":"Last few times we've been the service was terrible, the fries were smushy and cold and the food was mediocre... I'm not a high matienence customer at all and I never send food back to the kitchen but their burger was cold and the fries tasted microwaved (you know that water smushy content kind).. ever since the menus been automated and staff has been cut it's gone down hill... no one has a smile on themselves..."}
{"text":"I first have to say that I love Red Robin. We always go for my birthday every year. That being said, we have been to the Red Robin in Gilbert twice now and the service has been sub-par both times. We went to lunch today to celebrate my husband's birthday this Sunday. Our server was kind but not very good at her job. I ordered a coffee that was never refilled, she forgot to take our order completely the first time and had to come back and get our order a second time. By the time the food came my husband and I had lost our appetite from eating the appetizer and sitting for 15 minutes. Besides the bad service, the restaurant was dirty. The women's bathroom was out of toilet paper and I saw lots of staff members just standing around instead of cleaning up the place. It comes down to bad management. Whoever is in charge needs to step up their game or find a different career that doesn't require supervising staff."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places but man is it because they just opened but the service sucks! We were seated right away then drinks orders were taken. After 10 mins of no drinks we walked to the bar to get our own water.  Manager did come to our table to acknowledge delay in drinks and offered a free appetizer. That was nice.when our order arrived they got it wrong. We ordered a chicken sandwich and got a burger instead. Waited 5 more minutes for correct order to arrive. Them the table next to us waited a long time for their drinks as well. They are way over staffed and can't get things done. I hope it's just because they just opened and are super busy. Let's see..I might give them another try in a month or so."}
{"text":"Unlimited fries.

Is there really anything to be said after this?

OK, they are the thick cut steak fries.  And never cold nor stale.

Even when I get a take-out burger, they will give me a whole box of extra fries.  Who doesn't love that?

But the burgers are really good.  Always hot, fresh, and well seasoned. 

I prefer to grab and go here, as it can get over run with kids, which, if you're not with your own, can be a PITA.

I do agree with the other reviewers that being served a meal in a plastic red basket is a turn off.  Can they swing a plate?  You have to wash the baskets anyhow (DON'T YOU???)."}
{"text":"WOW!  We just got back from one of our best dining experiences ever.  Our two-year-old had his birthday yesterday and his two-year checkup today (including blood draw-yuck).  His mom, his six-month-old brother, and I dropped by for some fun-food.  Server Sierra gave him some apple slices (for free) which he loved.  She even asked us if she could give him a little birthday sundae.  (how do you say no to a kid with a cotton bandage on his arm?)  Anyway, Mom and dad had burgers (excellent) with bottomless, steak fries and steamed broccoli.  The wait staff and their supervisor took very good care of us.  Thanks again, Red Robin.  We all had a great time."}
{"text":"Visited this Red Robin for the second time since their opening, still not impressed. They weren't busy at all so we were promptly seated and fairly quickly were visited by our server to take our drink and appetizer order. The food was received very quickly and staff was very attentive with refills and checking to see if anything else was needed. The food however was lacking. I had the shroom burger with fries and neither had any seasoning. I added salt but it still had little flavor.   Drink prices seemed quite high, $2.50 for a soda."}
{"text":"This was my first Red Robin experience.  I am a big fan of egg and  burgers so I went for the Royal Red Robin Burger®.  Not bad, but not the best I've had.  I had a couple of discrepancies with the burger; the burger came out well done when it was ordered medium, and the egg was broken and overcooked.  The onion ring and fried mozzarella sticks appetizers were also OK.  I was not in love the appetizer sauces (marinara and tangy campfire).

The staff were super friendly and the restaurant had a playful family atmosphere.  Although it wasn't addictive I would definitely choose to eat here over a lot of other chain competitors."}
{"text":"Another Excellent Dinner at Red Robin!! 

Hostess greeted us with a warm smile and seated us with the option  that if their was anything else we needed to let her know. :)
5 stars there! 

Drew our waiter was on top of everything as far as our drinks, extra napkins, can we get this, can we get that requests. He did it all quickly and with a genuine  smile! 5 stars for Drew!! He made our dining experience fabulous!!

Food was cooked perfect!! This includes my well done burger. It was just right not burnt. Everything looked amazing and was absolutely delicious! 5 stars to the cooks for getting just the right amount of crisp to our fresh, hot, fries!! \"Hip! Hip! Hooray!\" 

Definitely recommend this location. 

Tip- ask if Drew is on. If you like a great waiter. His seating area is in booths located near the bar area of restaurant usually.  It's not rowdy or bad. Usually slow.


We Came Hungry and Left Happy!! 5 Star Yummmmmmm!! :) Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great deals! All you can eat fries/sweet potato fries when you order a burger!! Tasty drinks! Great atmosphere and service! Totally kid friendly too to those of you with kids but for anyone too! Made for anyone who is craving a good burger or sandwich, a good salad and of course dessert!! Allison was our server! She is fantastic, upbeat, super Friendly and hard working! She made our experience that much more enjoyable! Perfect for that type of restaurant!"}
{"text":"Don't bother...really. Mediocre, notably unimaginative burgers, a prosaic selection of beers, very slow service, noisy ... the experience was on a par with any of the generic chain restaurants (Chilis, TGIFridays, etc.) but slightly pricier, slower, and more forgettable."}
{"text":"First and foremost this rating does not reflect the quality of the food I've had but the management or at least one manager. 

I called in and ordered a free birthday burger I had earned. After picking up the burger which was a veggie burger and getting home ready to eat it and realized that I had been given a BBQ bacon cheddar burger. I then called up and spoke to a manager who was super nice and told me to come back up and they would remake the burger and comp me a free dessert. Great I thought, well I ended up not making it back up there (long day at work and I was tired). 

Fast forward to today, I make it back up there and bring in the incorrect uneaten burger to show. The manager who I spoke with the night before along with another manager who already seemed to have some sort of attitude. She told me that I'd just get the burger but no dessert. Anyone who has ever ordered from RR knows they tell you it takes 15-20 minutes for any of the burgers and fries to be prepared. The female manager came out in LESS than 5 minutes with the burger. 

Obviously she couldn't be bothered to remake a fresh burger for me and the free dessert I was told I'd receive as well. I get it, some will argue and say \"But it was free anyway\", well I'd hate to see how things would've been handled had I paid for it. As a manager you can't be mad for a mistake one of your employees made when boxing up the order or that I did not come in again the same night. What if I didn't have a car or had the luxury just to come whenever? Bottom line is this whole situation was not handled appropriately and now I have two burgers I can't even eat."}
{"text":"I use to love going here however they have all gotten rid of the boca burger which was my favorite, and replaced it with a different veggie burger which is gross. I am vegan and because of this change I will not be going back and taking my friends and family with me."}
{"text":"I would not say it is \"GOURMET.\" If you want gourmet burgers, go to Paradise valley burger. 
I like Fuddruckers more than this place."}
{"text":"Since I work in the mall as well, I've been here a few times to pick up stuff for my staff.  Today I went in to pick up a free birthday burger (delicious!) so it's awesome they do this. However, the staff always acts as if you don't exist. Everytime I come, I see multiple people, they always walk by me so clearly they see me, but never a greeting, never a \"we'll be right with you\"...nothing. Anyway, great burger, horrible to go service. 

On the up side, I would think dine in service is better."}
{"text":"Night out on the town always goes well with a great start during dinner! Stopped here before heading to Summer at Summerlin outdoor music. We got seated immediately and our waiter was great. We received our drinks quickly and our order was placed without issue. He even anticipated our needs and wants! Our meal was great and we had plenty of time to enjoy it before the music began. 


I ordered the whiskey river burger and substituted the bun for a lettuce wrap (trying to justify eating the great bottomless fries). The burger was cooked great and my entire meal was fantastic! Will definitely go back and try another item on the list next time I come here."}
{"text":"The food was good, however the service is slowwww. I got the black and bleu burger, it was cooked to perfection and tasted great. If you like blue cheese this is the burger for you. Its on a toasted ciabatta bun so this helps make sure the bun doesn't get soggy. The burgers are heavy and a lot to eat so you'll probably be very sleepy afterwards. The fries could have been a little more crispy for me, being they are steak fries they tend to be a little soggy. We also got an onion ring tower and those were great. Overall the food is a solid 8/10.


However just to get the burger it took probably over 30 mins. The restaurant seemed clean to me so that's a plus."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here recently and had the worst dining experience. No one introduced themselves as our server, so we flagged down the server for the table next to us after waiting a long time. He seemed very put out and unhelpful. We had to ask random employees for waters and napkins. Then after we order, they came back and said they ran out of some of the ingredients for my meal. Usually Red Robin has great customer service but they definitely failed here. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"There was a wait for a table in an prey restaurant. Slowest service imaginable. Orders came out wrong. I would avoid this location."}
{"text":"Just went to Red robin here in Scottsdale after a math final, and Kara was Awesome! Very attentive and nice. Also the Royal burger was fantastic! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The burgers are a little pricey here for what they are but the gourmet ones are good. My favorite is the Burnin' Love, it comes with a whole roasted jalapeno on top.
Burgers come with a side, which can be bottomless fries. They are kind of thick cut, and my favorite are the garlic flavored ones. I think they charge like $2 extra for the parmesan garlic favoring.
Service is OK and it can get kind of noisy. 
They do have a good rewards program and you get a free burger for your birthday, and random other offers throughout the year.
My wife usually gets a plain burger with a fried egg, wrapped in lettuce instead of burger bun.
They have the restaurant kiosk thing on every table 
This location is by the Chick-Fil-A by Scottsdale 101, it was a very decent parking lot."}
{"text":"Red Robin would be a great place if we lived in a world where the number one killer was not heart disease. Sure the burgers, fries and whatever are tasty but this is 2012. Once McDonald's starts a healthy menu that is a good sign you should too. On a rare occasion I am fine with pigging out and eating 3500 calories. But this place does not give you an option. Your only choice is to enjoy a meal and take a year off your life. The Red Robin I went to had very friendly staff, they even made the kids balloons. However on a corporate level you have to take some responsibility and either change out the tables for treadmills you can sprint on while you eat or add a healthy menu."}
{"text":"You just CAN'T win!  I've been a customer here for decades, but am really sick and tired of being fooled by so-called 'healthy food' choices when I go out to eat!  I had a veggie burger here recently, and it was delicious.  However, when I later checked out the nutritional info online, I was utterly shocked to find out that it has more calories (1200) than the rest of the real meat burgers!  AND, 87 grams of fat (16 saturated), with 1 gram of trans fat!  'Are you effing kidding me?', I thought dissapointingly and shockingly!  This is a huge problem, and endemic in the restaurant industry here in America.  Many supposedly 'healthy' food choices are in fact not, and even worse that many of the foods we know to be generally unhealthy!  I have even read that many salads and wraps surpassing unhealthy foods in calories and fat content.  I wish the chain restaurant industry would indicate (next to the item on the menu) key nutritional information such as calories, fat, and trans fat.  This is just one reason there is an obesity and diabetes epidemic in this country, and why for the first time, current generations are not living as long as their parents!"}
{"text":"March 26th called on the phone to try to order a few things so I can pick them up I was put on hold for over 5 minutes so I decided to come in because I had a gift card I came in wasn't attended to right away the bartender did take my order did take my gift card not smiling not unhappy neither transaction was made hot food on a cold salad which should never ever ever be done on any to go orders whatsoever no silverware in the bag no napkins but I never have to come here again my gift certificate was used up and I'll never step foot in here again. Trying to post a picture of a Bowl of chicken tortilla soup how sad good luck Red Robin"}
{"text":"Red Robin is a family favorite for us. I am a fan because they have a nice menu selection and they always seem to move quickly from the initial wait to be seated, if there is one at all, to getting your food.
I also like that they have had the same menu since forever, so you always know what to expect, and then of course, you just can't beat bottomless steak fries! My hubby always orders a basket of fries right when we are seated and then he just keeps them coming! This always keeps the kids busy and happy and it beats having to order an appetizer! I will say, I do miss the old baskets and the way they would wrap the burgers, not so much down with the new motif of everything now, but the food is still the same so I can let it slide. 
Another bonus is having the Rewards card because you get a point every time you order a meal, and at 10 points you get a free meal. That adds up really quickly. Plus you get a free meal on your birthday and you can register the kids for free birthday meals too, and that's not to mention all the bonus coupons and freebies they email you! 

Plus R.R. is originally from Seattle and I always say everything amazing comes from Washington State :-)"}
{"text":"This is an inexpensive way to eat out with the family. We go here often and mostly get good service. We use their Red Royalty card to save money. Often we end up getting an entree for free! It is clean and everyone can find something they like. Managers are responsive when there is an issue."}
{"text":"My wife, granddaughter and I went the one by Chandler mall.  I had a cheese burger (medium) and fries, My wife had a chicken sandwich and fries, my GD had spaghetti noodles w/ no sauce and mandarin oranges.  Sodas all around. My burger was thin and charred black on the edges (definitely not medium), and eight half sized fries.  the other meals were as expected.  Service was great but food quality was terrible.  The manager should be embarrassed.  Worse yet was the bill of, after minimal tip, $43.00.  I went to In-n-Out the night before and had better burgers and fries for $12.00 adn I'm not that big of a fan of In-n-Out.  My wife and I can go to Texas Roadhouse, share the big bone in rib eye, big loaded baked potato, salad, skewer of shrimp, beer for me and tea for her for $40.00 after tip and leave totally satisfied."}
{"text":"Ok, so everything was fine until we got our food.  The restaurant was completely dead and once the food was delivered our server dropped off our check and said, \"No hurry, I am not going anywhere\"  then a few minutes later came to take plates that we were still working on.  We had to tell him to chill out that we were still working on our food since we just received it!  After we were finally finished with our plates he had the nerve to ask \" did you save room for dessert?\"  I responded \"even if we did, it is too late for you because you already printed our check 20 minutes ago, so you lose\" 

I could be wrong, but I thought at Red Robin, they were suppose to bring you an unlimited amount of fries?  We only received about 12 with our plates and no more!!  It was almost like the fry Nazi was working in the kitchen tonight!  Upon our exit, when I mentioned to the host who asked \"How were things?\"  I responded \"eh\"  she asked what was wrong and when I mentioned the fries as we were outside of the restaurant she responded \"would you like more fries?\"  Um kind of too late for that right? We are already on our way to our vehicle.

The food on the other hand was great!!  I like how they finally changed the menu up to get more options, I am also happy that they no long serve your food in those crazy little baskets.  I did eat at one on Eastern, the service there is always amazing, I will only go to that one from now on."}
{"text":"Though it was my first time to Red Robin, overall the restaurant left me with a good impression! My friends and I came after an exam and it was close to where our school is. Also, got some shopping done since it is inside the Galleria Mall!

Right when we entered, the service was quick and our server was really nice. The waiter came around multiple times throughout checking in when we needed refills on drinks and french fries.

I had ordered the Burnin Love burger hearing from my friend that it was really good. And he was right! Though Burnin Love consist of fried jalapeno circle rings, it did not make the heat too spicy or ruin my taste buds. Rather, it gave a smokey taste in the burger. I usually can tolerate spicy really well, so that may be the reason as well. In addition, the burger is really filling! And the portion is decent!

The seasoning that is available to be placed on your fries, be sure to try it! I love the dry spice seasoning, I never thought about such an idea! It made the fries have an explosion of flavors in your mouth. In addition, our server also brought us two sauces, ranch and a mustard poppy-seed one. Mustard poppy-seed was a new sauce for me, however, it was pretty good. If you are into a sweeter sauce, that one is a definite to try!

I was very satisfied with the service and the food here. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food was good. Ordered the bbq pork chips & they were delicious. The only thing missing that would put this dish over the top good are sliced jalapenos. So I ordered some on the side."}
{"text":"those sallty caramel milkshakes.......wow. love the burgers they are all pretty decent. endless fries are a plus (even if you cant eat more than one basket) :)"}
{"text":"Had a great late lunch after work. Redrobin is always a good place to eat but this occasion was exceptionally great! Sydney in the bar area was an excellent waitress! She made sure we always had enough bottomless fries as well as dipping sauce. Best service I've ever received at this location."}
{"text":"Red Robin has recently changed their menu and the \"appearance\" of their food. 
The no longer serve food in bowls!? What the heck is that? 
My favorite item is a dinner salad, and it now comes on this long square plate.. With no lip or edge. It makes it super inconvenient to \"scoop\" out the good stuff at the bottom. 
I requested to have it put in a bowl and the waitress  said \" they don't  have bowls any more\"...sad day :(
I'll still come here as a regular hot spot, just have to get use to the change."}
{"text":"-----EDIT-----
4 Stars
Came here again to give it a second chance, and the visit didn't disappoint. We had a waiter who was very friendly and never had us feeling forgotten about or less important than the other customers. The food was great and orders were correct, so nothing to complain about there. The waiter doubled up as the bartender and he had the friendly persona to go with it. I'm updating my 1 star review to a 4 star since 3 would be stingy with an all around good experience. (& glad I didn't get the waitress we got last time!)
-----EDIT-----

1 Star
I'm used to great food and service with Red Robin, but this location was very disappointing. The waitress brought us drinks with no ice, and when I asked if we could get some, she mentioned they were running low. The issue with this, is every other drink that came out of the kitchen had a normal and decent amount of ice. This was inconsistent and bothersome. 

The waitress approached our table initially, and she would only interact with my husband. This followed through when she had brought more ice back in her pitcher of water, and managed to only give him ice while she managed to give me none during the next refill. 

Just bad service. I love the food for the price, but I won't be going back to this particular location. It's unfortunate that we have to drive out to Rio Salado when this location was conveniently located next to a Costco. No thanks."}
{"text":"This location is friendly, clean, and their food is what you'd expect from a Red Robin diner. It's a little far for us to drive out there, but I appreciate the price margin and the quality of the food. Whenever I feel like an \"american diner\" this is the place I usually prefer. 

It's such an upgrade from a Johnny Rocket's establishment feel, where they leave plastic bag pieces in your milkshake. I'll definitely keep coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Went the other night and got a burger with some kind of truffle sauce and another with mac n cheese on it. The truffle burger was DELICIOUS and the mac n cheese burger was really good too. Got bottomless steak fries but was so full by the time I was done with my first batch that I couldn't even order a second batch. Very good food and great value for the money!"}
{"text":"We went in about 4:15 on a Wed.  It was lightly busy and were seated right away. We both ordered burgers and they were pretty good.  I ordered double patty Bourbon BBQ. It was good and cooked as ordered.  The other was a lettuce wrapped burger which was good also.  Fries were fresh and not greasy at all.  The waitress was in a hurry and was pushing us to order though we ordered drinks and a 1/2 stack of onions rings  which were very good and crunchy.  Burgers arrived in about 15 minutes.  We were still eating and the waitress came and asked about deserts.  We said we had to finish first, and then we never saw her again. No refill of drinks, water, or the supposed bottomless steak fries.  We paid using the machine and never did get desert.  They advertise to come in and hang out, but the service is pushing you out the door before you are even done eating.  The burgers were good enough, and reasonably priced to try again.  But next time, I hope we get another waitress who isn't in such a big hurry that she forgets what her job is."}
{"text":"Went to the new Red Robin with three of my friends last night. The food was delicious and the staff was attentive. Kudos to our waitress, Gigi! It was her first night training as a server for Red Robin and she was remarkable. Spent some time talking to the trainer and she was a sweet heart too! Great experience!"}
{"text":"25 minute wait and I go in to use the bathroom and almost every booth is empty in the place. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Ate a burger last night, and got sick with headache, diarrahea, and the chills.  will not go back."}
{"text":"The burgers were mediocre, nothing special. The French fries seemed like they were just microwaved and weren't very tasteful. The Oreo milkshake was very good but no very thick. The atmosphere was ok and the waitress was pretty attentive. The food lacked taste and wasn't really worth it... Not coming again"}
{"text":"Good place to get late night, greasy appetizers. However, there are many other choices for a good meal around this area."}
{"text":"Tony was a great server, four stars for that fella. Thanks man, you've got some game in an otherwise boring establishment. 

I think the best way to stomach Red Robin is in the bar section. Otherwise, you're subjected to happy birthday songs to the teeming hordes of white america, punctuated with screaming kids in claustrophobic seating conditions, all whilst bookended by brightly colored accent walls and randomly angled television screens. If Chuck E Cheese decided to open a burger joint, I can imagine this was one of that crazy rat's visions. 

The food is OK, reminds me if Ruby Tuesday got frisky with a Friday's, but the love child product is a half-step below both parents. They have a lot of specialty burgers. I think the traditional sesame seed buns are mealy and lacking stability. A substandard platform for otherwise decent beef and chicken and toppings. Papa got the chicken and waffles sandwich, a nice offering but he said the sauce was too hot. Grandma got a grilled chicken breast with fancy sauce and a nice looking salad, which looked uptown compared to my cheeseburger and cold fries. 

So the server was good, and the bar was well stocked with liquor and craft beers. The food was decent, largish menu so you can find something for anyone. Several gluten-free options present, and Tony was well-informed on food allergy issues. The seating area was too crowded and loud. The host staff was helpful. Overall a solid three stars, an as-advertised burger joint with laminated menus."}
{"text":"Last two visits.... EXCELLENT !!!

Love the Tavern Menu and Happy Hour!

Great value option if you do not want to spend $13 on a burger.

Service was on point both visits (bar area). And food was HOT and executed well.

I used to not like Red Robin, but the Metro Center location has me coming around! 

Nice job!"}
{"text":"I hate that they changed the recipe for the garlic fries..they use dry seasoning now and it's terrible.. Kati the bartender is very helpful and a hard worker.."}
{"text":"I love Red Robin.  I really do and I'm not writing this review about the food, but more the service.  We stopped by there at 8pm last night 8/11.  It wasn't super busy but it wasn't slow. The front staff was totally unprofessional and I felt like it was such a chore to seat me.  Our waitress Jasmine did not bring us any type of silverware or napkins.  She took our drink order and I ordered an ice tea and we also decided to get the fried pickles as an appetizer.  She was so slow to bring our drinks.  The soda my bf ordered was flat and we had to flag her down and I asked for sweetener.  She never came back.  I had to go to the bar and ask for sweetener, I had to ask for silverware and FINALLY our appetizer came out.  Still my bf had no drink and then no more than 5mins later, our food came out.  I was fed up.  The manager was nice and comped some of the food, but I really didn't want Jasmine as our waitress.  After complaining...she was no where to be seen.  Finally she came by and checked on us.  Never an apology or anything.  Just as if nothing had ever happened.  I will probably be back to Red Robin, it will just never be this one."}
{"text":"Slow, staff doesn't care. Burgers are not good, the checkout system is a joke. My burger came with three fries and the waitress didn't even ask if we wanted more, so much for the only gimmick they got. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Pretty dirty. Was sat by a window, crumbs and trash in window area. Table sticky, had been wiped but needs a scrub. The entrance should have been the sign not to go in!  Filthy, trash, cigarette butts, disgusting sidewalk entrance. Food was soso, chicken tenders and fish sticks not hard to screw up.  Had to go chase down a waitress to get our ordered dips to go with.  Yah, I say pass on this place."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The food was fantastic. I had the clam chowder soup and it was delicious, best I've ever had. I had the burning love burger which was out of this world. The fries are great, only wish they would've been a little hotter. Would've gotten 5 stars but I didn't due to the service. The waiter was very friendly and pleasant but he forgot almost  everything we asked for. He was also nowhere to be found when we needed him. I've had problems with the service before. I hope they get this straightened out. I would definitely go back though, the food is just too good. :)"}
{"text":"There is just nothing good to say about the service, food or cleanliness of this place. The corporate people should take notice to fix this."}
{"text":"Since we were out of town and I haven't tried Red Robin, ever (believe it!), we went to this location to check out their food.

They have remodeled the place, which is huge, and fun environment. They have an upgraded menu, more modern, but this isn't a place for you if you want healthy food or if you're a vegetarian. It took us a while to find burgers without bacon added on them. I got one of their \"finest\", the DGB with oven roasted tomatoes, arugula, olive oil dressing on ciabatta. It was pretty good, more interesting. My husband wasn't too impressed with his Whiskey River BBQ, kinda bland, he wanted his cooked well done and it was more rare than he wanted. I wanted regular fries and our waiter assumed I ordered sweet potato fries, which I don't like (and didn't order) and that's what he brought me. Since they have their endless basket of fries, I got regular ones soon. The basket is pretty small and I don't eat a lot of fries. I can't say I was impressed with them.

The beer selection is poor, I couldn't get anything better on the tap besides Sam Adams. Just your regular Buds, etc, nothing special. I'm a beer aficionado, so this place's selection didn't make the cut for me.

They have some gadgets on the table if you need to call your waiter. That didn't work. Service wasn't great, the beers came late, just before they brought our food.

They have loyalty cards if you go to this place a lot, better get one to enjoy some perks, coupons, etc. They give you a free burger when the local football team wins, so look into that for details. I don't live in the area, so I don't have the scoop on it.

I care about my girlish figure, so this visit is just a rare occasion for me at Red Robin, not a habit."}
{"text":"Greeted and taken to a table. Table was dirty with water rings from the previous party. Hostess went to get a napkin, a regular table napkin, and wiped off the table- shoving the crumbs to the floor. 
I told her I would prefer it actually be cleaned and would wait. Menu still in hand she got a wet rag, wiped it off and sat me at the soaking table. I asked her to dry it. 
She then asked and commented on why I was dining alone...
I placed my order and then ordered a wedge salad on the table top menu ziosk. No salad eve came. Around 15-20 minutes later my burger appeared and the waitress said the salad was coming. I canceled the mini wedge as that was an appetizer. 

Someone came to apologize but stated the kitchen never received the order. If they hadn't how would the waitress know to say it was coming...  

This was a reward burger but has taken
way longer. McDonald's wouldve been better. 

On a good note burger was ok. Nothing special but it was a reward burger.

After all that charged me for the salad, had to get it removed... asked to leave a tip via card, they heard me wrong. Poor waitress I wish I had cash but after all that atleast she got something."}
{"text":"New Red Robin opened close to home in Rocky River a short while ago. 
My family dropped by on what we came to find out was week #1. The experience was enough to keep most away 
From a return visit, but that wouldn't have been fair or reasonable.
The reality is they were packed. That is enough stress for most restaurant staffs but considering they had just opened I opted not to review and wait for a second visit.
Well my second visit came last week, except it wasn't in the restaurant we chose carry out after a king day.

We ordered 2 burgers and fries. Carry out can often be less desirable but proximity wise to home meant the food would still be hot.

Update is we have been back twice once dine in and carry out. 
This will definitely be a go to for fast easy dine in or take out.
Not the healthiest but good burgers and consistent good."}
{"text":"What can I say, it is Red Robin!? It is a chain but it's a good one! I always ask for Loretta because she is the best server/bartender :)"}
{"text":"My wife, kids, and I went here for dinner last night.   My and I were in the restaurant industry for a number of years, so we understand more than the average person that things can happen in a restaurant that are out of your control as a server.  With that being said, we did not have a good experience at this Red Robin!  Our server was friendly, so that was not an issue at all; I cannot for the life of me remember his name, but I wouldn't want to throw him under the bus because as I said, he was a nice guy.  The food was average; we have been here before and the food has been very good!  I don't know if it was the business of a Friday night, but our daughters' pizzas were lukewarm at best.  The burgers my wife and I had were good, but the fries were warm.  We were never brought fries before our meal.  The food took forever to come out, which on a Friday night is understandable with a full restaurant.  The biggest issue we had with the night was the service.  We were at the restaurant for about two hours, and our server came to our table maybe three times in that time period.  When he did come over it was in a passing manner.  I had an empty drink for about twenty minutes.  After our food was out we were checked on once and that was when our food was halfway done; we were never approached after that.  I believe a large part of the service we had was that our server was extremely overwhelmed.  He had way more tables than he could handle, but no one was really helping him out.  This location either needs to have a better management plan on how to run a restaurant during busy times, or they need more staff (servers) on the floor to limit their table amounts."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. The burgers were cooked just right. Service not great and seemed unorganized. With a Capriotti's right next door I expected better service with a friendly smile greeting me when I entered. 


My second time eating here and the food was terrible. My roast beef dip was cold although the au jus was hot. The quality of the beef was not good. My friends chicken sandwich was also cold. Service was better than my first experience but the food was not as good."}
{"text":"I really wanted some steak fries (really, really wanted fries), so I decided to stop into this Red Robin on my lunch break. 

Service was quick, even though it was very busy.
My server asked me how everything tasted, and well, I was honest and I told him I wasn't happy. 
The manager came over, offered to get it right. I couldn't wait for another sandwich because I needed to get back to work but he offered me another item to go.

Good customer service goes a long, long way. I appreciated it and walked out happy.
The server was attentive and checked on me to make sure everything was ok and that the manager had addressed my issue.

I'd be willing to give this location another try, simply based on the service I received."}
{"text":"I decided to stop here and give it a try after never really dining here. On walking in I was already disappointed being I had to wait at least 10 mins just to be seated. She asked if seating in the bar area was ok I said I prefer a booth but she kinda ignored me I guess. After seating there was a tablet that was not working on the table so I'm not sure what that was for everyone else's seem to work. Eventually the bar girl came over I asked for a water and that was fast but then she disappeared for a good 15 mins before coming back to ask me for my
Order. Next I order the a1 peppercorn burger i think was the name. I asked for some pink as she would ask how I wanted it cooked and later on someone else new brought out my food and the bar tender was still gone. I cut my burger open and it's way over cooked kinda dry. I was disappointed and I just kinda sucked it up cause the bar tender was taking forever and I was in a rush. The fries where very sawgy so I asked for another basket being there bottomless and those weren't much
 better. I feel bad because there was another guy at the bar sitting who you could tell was getting frustrated because the lack of service and staff being no where to be found. Overall this is my last trip here and I don't rhink I'll be returning I'm so disappointed in the service I received."}
{"text":"We are visiting Arizona from Michigan. We have visited a plethora of Red Robin restaurants across the country and this was an average experience. We were greeted pretty quickly and had our waiter come immediately. He was super nice and his service was great. The food took a pretty long time to come even though they weren't busy. Food was warm and good. Our waiter was also behind the bar making drinks so all things considered, he was attentive as possible. He cleared our fishes quickly and took my plate before I was finished. I didn't say anything because he was quick, which is appreciated but I would have definitely eaten the rest of my meal had my plates stayed. I think he was just trying to stay on top of things while also running the bar area.
Overall, a good lunch!"}
{"text":"My go to Red Robin! Service is amazing here! Food is so amazing, love that they have vegetarian and vegan options!!! So I get my vegetarian:vegan fix while husband gets his burgers! Did I mention happy hour is amazing! Love the atmosphere here, since I do have a Red Robin closer to my place but I travel the extra 5 miles to go here instead!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch here today, our server was very attentive and even boxed up my request for extra  bottomless Fries. I know this is a burger place but my absolute favorite thing is the BLTA Croissant and fries.....Yummy! !"}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 9, 7 kids. We waited 15 minutes so we asked for fries while we waited for food. They did not bring any. We had to ask for campfire three times. No one checked on us for refills. I had to get up to ask for the check. We were there a total of two hours and they were not busy, but they had plenty of help to gather in the kitchen and talk. This is the fifth visit and none were good. So sad. Go across the street to Mod or Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"We've been going here for a couple years and I have never put up a review of it.  So let me first say, this has NOTHING to do with service.  Service i so subjective that I hate to even see it in a review.  The best wait-person in the world will have an off day or rub someone the wrong way.  This is about the food.  (Specifically, the burgers)
I really feel this place should be in Vegas, because you throw the dice every time you walk in the place.  I'm giving them 3 stars because I have had about as many good burgers as I have had bad ones.  It really is a crap shoot as to whether you will get something you like or something that you will wish you went someplace else.   And I'm not talking about the 400 different styles of burger.   The end product has no consistency, so if you find a favorite, be prepared to be disappointed half the time.  Personally, I normally get the patty melt, as it seems to be the easiest one for them to Not screw up.  However, even here, the quality and the final product varies Wildly.  
Dining in, is better, but not a guarantee for quality.  However, you do have the chance to send it back and have them make an attempt at fixing it for you.  On The Other Hand..,  if we get food for takeout, then place your bets.  Their takeout is the worst, and we have come home to stone cold burgers, congealed grease fries, and mistake orders.  If fact the takeout is so bad that if we have to order for carryout, we now go somewhere else.  Which is sad, because when they are on point, this place has one of the top 5 burgers in town.  But when it is bad...  I'd be more happy with Jack in the Box.
Go ahead and give it a shot.  It is worth the gamble, but remember what you get your first time, next time it will be a completely different burger."}
{"text":"My friends and I went there today for a fun meal and a get together. The food was soggy and the service was terrible. We had to ask for water, and then after the water arrived we had to flag our waitress down to get straws. After we ordered it took 40 minutes for our food to arrive and they got the border wrong. When we went to pay for our food the sever acted like it was a major inconvenients to split the bill. We won't be going there again"}
{"text":"Red Robin has the best burgers in America, at least as far as commonplace chains go. They have wraps, salads, and chicken sandwiches, too, but I've only had the burgers and they're awesome. I was sadly disappointed to find that they stopped serving the Santa Fe cheeseburger or whatever it was called, but the Guacamole Bacon cheeseburger is a nice alternative. The fries are plentiful (supposedly they are refillable for free? I dunno, I'm usually too stuffed with the burger to find out) but a bit too salty and greasy. The sodas are too watered down right off the bat, perhaps due to the ice. The waitresses are friendly (and very nice to look at) but going there alone I feel slightly rushed as they hand me my cheque as soon as I start on the fries."}
{"text":"This is a terrific Red Robin location.  We came in on a Friday night and were pleased to be seated right away.  Our waiter, Derek, was attentive, helpful and quick!  He brought us french fries while waiting for our meals and that is always a plus!  He got all of my quirky ordering items correct.........for which he gets extra points!

I like mayo with my fries and I need a gluten free bun and need my food to be handled with clean  new gloves and he took care of that.  My chicken sandwich came out flavorful and not bland like it is at the Happy Valley location!  

So I will go to the Mayo location to get my mayo!  HA!  Seriously, we had a lot of picky eaters and he was amazing!  Everyone we encountered was very nice and personable so as a National Chain goes.......this location is a keeper!"}
{"text":"Its what you expect, burgers and fries.

But wait, there is more now.  There are sweet potato fries.  Yes, you heard it here first - sweet potato fries - yum.

I find the drinks fun to look at and yummy to drink but a bit on the pricey side.

Here's another great hint - they have smaller portion burgers!  I can never finish the whole regular burger so this is a great deal.

Comfortable easy place to be.  Someday I'll save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Usualy I am a #1 fan of red robin, but this was the worst experience I've ever had with RedRobin. It took 45 minutes to receive our appetizer and an hour and a half for our meals. Two people in our party didn't even receive their food. We finally canceled the order and ate at home. Understaffed and waitress didn't refill our drinks. I will NEVER return to this location. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Went in today to eat. Sat there for 10 minutes with our call server light flashing on our on table iPad type deal thing. Not only did no one come but no one was on the floor period, there were multiple tables with no server and people getting up asking about service so we got up and left. TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"We have always loved Red Robin and haven't been in awhile.  We went with friends and had a great waitress, Kristen.  Super friendly and helped us out when one of our burgers didn't arrive with everything it was supposed to have on it. She told us that they had a newer chef, but the problem was immediately rectified.  The only issue we really had was that she never asked us whether we were loyalty members, which we are, and we needed to pay our check with the little table kiosk in order to get the 20% military discount. We had to turn the machine on and thankfully since we had been before it wasn't an issue for us to log in and pay the check that way and get our discount.  My husband and I went with 2 of their newer burgers, the Mad Love (pricey at $14.49) and the Southern Charm($13.99).  His was the burger missing the onions which we did receive later, and mine was loaded with bacon, crispy cheese and avocado.  I loved mine and he was very happy with how his tasted as well.  Lots of goodness on those 2 babies.  Yum.  Overall we were once again happy with choosing RR.  Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"This rating is based on the \"new\" menu alone.  They have slashed the number of appetizers, burgers and other options.  No more nachos, chili con queso, chili-chili cheeseburger or garlic fries amongst others.  Used to love the variety, now it is too limited.
  The service during this visit was great."}
{"text":"I have a fiendish love/hate relationship with Red Robin.

On one hand it's a obnoxious chain restaurant.  The walls are covered with kitchy memorabilia and neon lights.  The music is loud and unpleasant.  There videogames in the lobby and balloons for the kids.  It makes me feel like such a tool.

But why do I go there?  Why can't I turn away?  Because they serve up the tastiest veggie burger I know.  It comes on a big, toasted bun, piled with toppings, grilled to perfection and accompanied by an endless supply of thick, seasoned fries.

I like Red Robin.  There I said it."}
{"text":"Horrible,second time having old stale fries.asked to speak to a manager he did nothing. Will not return,go to burger fi,they are way better and fresh"}
{"text":"I've only been to this location during working hours .. mon-fri and only for lunch 11:00-2:00 .. I say that because service is different at those hours then for dinner and on weekends when it's full of families with kids 

During the week, we never have had to wait for a table, our server always makes sure we get our drinks and keeps the refills coming, the bottomless fries are always a hit when we are starving and can't wait for our entrees to arrive, the food is good and the server checks on us just enough so we can still have our business meetings.

We are always satisfied with our food choices and keep coming back .. 

I seem to always have the same Avo-Cobb chicken salad.. avocado, boiled eggs, blue cheese, bacon, grilled chicken over salad .. what's there not to love.."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Red Robin in a while, and I came back with a friend of mine this afternoon to meet up for some food.  What a good time!  It was busy for a Sunday afternoon, but fortunately we didn't have to wait.

We were seated in the bar area and our server greeted us promptly.  We already had the menu's at our table, and after scouring it, I went with the fries.  My friend went with a chicken salad, and I her sister went with the fish and chips.  Overall, our food was tasty, and I really had a good time.

While we were busy gabbing, our server always refilled our drinks, and after I bill came we had our bill split.  She was friendly and nice, and I really enjoyed our time here.  I will say, the handicapped bathroom was out of service when I was there, and it was a bit messy and needed attention overall.  Nothing horrendous, but could have used someone to go in there and clean up the towels on the floor and mop some.

Overall a positive experience and I had a good time. Will be back when I'm in the area again!  Oh, and happy hour all Sunday long!"}
{"text":"Placed an online order, was very specific on what I wanted and didn't want on the items I ordered. I spent $70+ on 6 meals and 5 out of the 6 meals were incorrect. The food was good but just not how I had ordered it which was disappointing for spending so much money. I've eaten here many times and have never had bad service or incorrect food so I'm not sure if it's just a bad day or if they were super busy whatever the case is my order was still incorrect."}
{"text":"This experience was the worst I have ever had in my 43 yrs of dining out... where should I start... We walked into the restaurant to be meet by a manager on a personal phone call and the hostess taking a extremely long togo order. The manager never even made an attempt to help or even greet anyone that was at the door... 15 minutes later, hostess still taking a togo order and manager still hanging out talking on the phone. finally we where greeted by a employee that looked like \"cousin It\"... HAIR EVERYWHERE.... PEOPLE CHECK YOUR FOOD... THIS GIRL IS A FOODRUNNER (the girl could only see out of one eye with hair covering the other one). Walking to the table we noticed that the restaurant was trashed.... I mean trashed... and no one cleaning up. We counted 20 tables that was full of trash and dirty dishes, probably still dirty because the girl couldnt see but with one eye.  After being sat, I went to the restroom only to be meet by what looked like was a bloody fight where someone lost control of themselves and peed everywhere.... seats, floors, sinks, mirror... I mean even the soap to wash your hands looked like it was diluted with pee. This should have been my sign to high tail it out of this restaurant but I didnt and I regret that decision... First server came to the table and took ower drink order and walked away then followed by a second server asking the same thing.. we told her someone had already be to the table so she walked away..... to be followed by a third server asking what we wanted to drink... we were told then that the foodrunner ,that can only see out of one eye, was asking everyone to take our table. guessing she couldnt see the person she originally ask and thought she was still talking with the first server... guess we will never know. We recieved our food in a timely manner, however, the burger that i ordered didnt come with any toppings... while waiting for the toppings we noticed not one, not two, or not even three hairs but six human hairs resting on my plate, on my fries, on the burger and once we received the burger topping there were two more hairs in the toppings.
 Not exceptable. needless to say we left without eating a thing.... This experience is a prime example of poor managerment and lack of health standards.... I do not recommend this place to anyone....Red Robin, yall need to do alot better.... (hair tied back or in a hat... clean your bathroom and regularly check them... manager being more pro-active instead of just going through the motions... If i could give yall a negative rating it would be a -25 stars.."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at all the poor reviews. I've always been a fan of Red Robin. They definitely tend to overcook the burgers and you're lucky to get any pink at all but they're still juicy and tasty despite that.

Pros: Big fat steak fries with seasoning and smothered in ranch, doesn't get much better than that. Burgers are always tasty, even if usually slightly overcooked. 

Cons: Would like more pink on the burger and faster service.

Will continue supporting all Red Robins and getting my usual Banzai burger."}
{"text":"I only go when we have kids in our group. Food is OK and the atmosphere is good for kids. Other than that, you can get a better meal at a number of other places in Madison."}
{"text":"Standard burger fare.
I get a salad as I don't find their fries good enough to warrant an endless option.
Ghost chili burger was less spicy than the Sriracha burger.
Wait staff can really make or break your experience"}
{"text":"The service at this location was well above what we received at the Galleria location.
The fact that one can get lost in a burger menu is amazing. 
You get unlimited refills on your fries or salad and we were able to actually get our waitresses attention and order a second helping (not that it was needed).

I had the big Sir Acha Tavern with a salad and the wife had the Whiskey River BBQ with fries.

Okay, they do not explain the Big burger to you so I asked. It is $2.5 more so you expect a bigger burger.... well hold on. It is the same 1/3 oz patties, but they are made into one burger. So same start weight, theoretically you end up with more meat in the end because the thicker burger will not cook down as far as two individual burgers. Did I notice a huge difference? No. I did notice that there was more moisture left in the big patty than when you get the smaller ones.

The fries were rather good tonight, crispy outside and soft inside and the salad was actually refreshing.

I had the Ghost pepper burger on my last visit, the Sir Acha seemed spicier to me.

Dining room was clean and quite quiet.
Waitress was attentive and our water glasses never went empty."}
{"text":"A few years ago we started eating here and loved it! The last few visits have been less than enjoyable. Mediocrity has become the new norm here. Not at all busy but had to wait for a table to be cleaned in the bar area to get seated. There seemed to be lots of unenthusiastic employees present but last visit had the barkeep serving tables. Not nearly attentive enough. Fries were COLD on plate with a burger that was not hot either and a bun that seemed almost stale.  Never offered an additional serving of bottomless fries.  Needs a cleanup/makeover and better employee attitude/morale. Sadly, our last visit will be our last visit."}
{"text":"I ordered a BLT it was dry and tasteless could only get half of it down if I let the waitress throw the rest of it away"}
{"text":"We walked in there with a full soccer team (8 & 9 year old girls) and parents - 30 of us total.  As soon as they opened their doors! They weren't expecting it, and as you can imagine, it was a lot for anyone to handle, especially right at open.  We all had separate bills, too.  Any server's nightmare!  But the staff did such a great job, got all the food orders right and everything was perfect - especially the BLOODY MARY'S!!!!  (shhhhh ;)  Great job RR!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The only burger joint with gluten free buns. Great drink prices too. Bottomless fries can be dangerous though. :) 

Each time we come we've had exceptional service and food. Starting to be one of my favorite places. Though it's a bit loud."}
{"text":"Well for gourmet burgers it was ok. The server Dominic was pretty awesome. The establishment is clean, friendly, and family oriented. I know this review is coming a few months late but I honestly have nothing memorable about the food except for the bottomless fries and I do remember the burger I ordered was a bit dry and thinking if I come back here I'm never ordering THAT again. Wish I could remember what it was called...That was a plus. I will come by again if I'm in the area...have to give the place a second try. :)"}
{"text":"service has gone down there last 2 visit over a 1hr to get food and it was cold and or over cooked . bathrooms trash  all over the place and paper towel holders  empty they had rolls just sitting on the counter ."}
{"text":"Shout out to Cara @ Red Robin/Surprise! The food was great, the prices are reasonable,
but it's the service that tops this place for lunch/drinks/dinner.
Had the new \"Sombrero\" salad. Was a nice assortment of greens & black beans, tomato,
even some jalapeños. 
What really made our lunch was the service received from Cara. She's attentive, fun, helpful, and we felt she truly wanted our lunch to be great. We don't go to Red Robin that often, but due to the service we received from Cara, we'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"The food was good. However, the service left a bit to be desired. When we came to the table, there was still food debris on the table and one of the chairs. We ended up wiping it off ourselves. We also noticed that this was regular practice for this facility since they would seat their guests and then wipe the table in front of them. 

To note: They also got my order wrong and by the comment of the waitress, it seemed to be a normal occurrence. 

It is Father's Day, so they were probably busier than normal, however it doesn't excuse the lack of attention to detail. 

Aside from that, everyone was very polite and cordial.

Since these issues seem to be the norm, rather than the exception, I am only giving 2 stars."}
{"text":"This is honestly one of my favorite places The Food, customer service, and the atmosphere is always Amazing I strongly recommend this place to anyone who loves food and great service!! For even better service ask for Geoff"}
{"text":"When we arrived, it was PACKED...but we expected that on a Friday night at 630p. We considered going somewhere else, but I'm glad we didn't! Put our name in and were told it would be about 30 mins. 15 mins later, our name was called. Server was at our table within a minute and took our drink/appetizer order. I went to the restroom to wash my hands and by the time I came back, the appetizer was already on the table. We placed our dinner order and it also came out fast! I ordered the Royal Red burger with the fried egg....mmmmmmm! So good! My love got the cod fish and fries and said it was excellent! Our server was sooo attentive and quick. I wish I could remember her name. She had red hair and a friendly smile:-)"}
{"text":"I just went there for lunch with a friend, and our server was kind of new so we forgave him for his slowness and he was not the best server. But like I said he was new so he just needs more practice. However we got a burger that had BBQ sauce and crispy onions, but it was served to us cold. Not super cold, more like lukewarm. But it's very unpleasant for a burger. It was an all around bad experience but the reason I'm giving them a good review because we spoke with the GM Eric and he was so nice and listened to us. He actually ended up giving me all my money back which I did not expect. Like maybe a 10 dollar gift card or something, but no he actually refunded me. You go Eric.  two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Had to wait to be seated even though the place was not busy. The booth, the plates and restaurant were very dirty. (see pics) The food was good and our server (Nick) was very friendly. This place really needs to get it together. Worst Red Robin experience ever.
Had to add to this after we used the restrooms. Both were a mess! The mirrors were all streaked and there was paper on the floors. (pic attached) Ridiculous... We should have gone next door instead of spending almost $50 in a dirty restaurant."}
{"text":"Red Robin!..what can I say..besides that the burgers,services,staff is awesome!!..Been coming here for yrs my wife and I and the family. Never bad service and food,besides the very salty fries today but they fixed it quick. So no worries this place is awesome!.."}
{"text":"Horrible place to eat we love Red Robin but not this location. First of all our knifes had food caked on it. Then my wife's ice tea glass had something inside of it. No manager approach us to say at least sorry about the shittty glass and knife. And my burger was well done but charcoal done. My wife asks for some more fries but instead of the fries we got our check so yea the waitress forgot about us asking for more fries. And we gave this place another chance. Not coming back to this location ever horrible . I guess we will be driving 20mins when we want some good service and food to the Red Robin in Mesa Stapley & 60."}
{"text":"I went there on a weekend night. The restaurant was packed. I can tell the waitress is trying to hurry up our service but she's nice. There is nothing to complain about the service. However, the food is terrible. It's super greasy. I want a gourmet burger but not a burger from a fast food drive through. Paid for $10 but get a $3 quality food."}
{"text":"Had a great meal- all 6 of us enjoyed -we loved our waiter Devon and the manger amber......thank YOU~"}
{"text":"Bad hostess. We had party of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids) Other larger parties getting sat before us. No excuses. Terrible service."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Red Robin, so my review is limited to a first impression. I visited in July, 2017 at around 6:00 PM. I sat at the bar an ordered a traditional cheeseburger with American cheese and bacon at a medium temperature.  The bartender was very nice and made a few beer suggestions. I settled on a draft Pabst Blue Ribbon. The beer was cold and the burger was super good and extremely filling. I would return, and would also recommend the Red Robin to anyone."}
{"text":"Cause of their bottomless fries!

Need I say more?  I enjoy a good burger and as weird as it sounds Red Robins always seem to satisfy my appetite.  My favorite so far is the Guacamole Burger with bacon --- yum!  Always done right!  The place itself is a zoo with a carnival on the side; babies crying and kids running amuck.  If you can't handle that then I say please stay away!  I always hangout at the bar where there are no kids allowed; good call!  The drinks here are pretty basic and each wait staff has their specialty drink you can order -- cool!  This location is a tad bit noisier I feel since it is closer to the ASU crowd and I gather it's more family oriented because of the marketplace.  Oh well it's just for a quick bite! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever come across- If I could give no stars I would. I went out to dinner Saturday afternoon with a fairly large party and upon sitting we informed the server of how we would be splitting our check to ensure that there would be no confusion and he reassured us that it would be no problem. When it came time to pay the server divided the check \"evenly\" amongst all of our party members with the total coming out to around $13.50 per person. This did not make any sense as some ordered more than others and one person in our group didn't order anything at all. We finally requested that each individual pay for what they personally ordered and were instructed to write down what each of us received, we were then given new reciepts by a different server and payed our personal balances. The server returned and told us that our total balance was over $300 and that we were $80 short. One of the members in my party was willing to pay the $80 because we were running late to a function we had to attend, but then we realized that something was wrong- if all 17 of us were initially supposed to pay $13.50 then the total balance should have been $230. When we called the server out on her error she left and returned saying we actually only owed $20. She also complained to us about how \"her shift should have ended an hour ago.\" To make matters worse, none of us received the proper amount of change which leads me to believe that the server wanted to scam us out of as much money as possible, or simply does not know how to split a check or give proper change, which I believe all servers should know how to do. Overall it was the worst service I have ever encountered and will not be returning, I advise anyone reading this to take their hard earned money elsewhere and avoid being scammed"}
{"text":"Table and menu wasn't totally clean. Fries are hit and miss. The California chicken burger was as good as alway. Great on refills and service."}
{"text":"I like the set up. Staff is friendly. Kind of disappointed with the appetizer size. Got the spinach artichoke dip and it came out in what looked like a sample bowl.The chips were light and delicious and you can tell it's homemade. But the dip was still good. Wish they gave a little more for the price. And maybe not have raw onions sprinkled on top.
I always get the Banzai Burger but decided to be adventurous and try the French Dip.  It was pretty good. It has great flavor. And i love the taste of horseradish. That is honestly my favorite part. The cole slaw is tangy and delicious. And how could you go wrong with bottom less fries!!"}
{"text":"I love Red Robin. It's an amazing place and I have rated other locations a 5, but this location only gets a 4 because I went there today and was FREEZING the whole time. I was so uncomfortable.

The food was amazingly tasty as usual and all five of us were really happy with the meal and the service, it was just way way too cold. 

I would definitely recommend heading here for one of the many awesome gourmet burgers or the fiesta fajita salad, but BRING A JACKET!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to take my lunch break here at the new Red Robin location. The host Howard had already seen us approaching the door and decided to open the door for my coworker and I. We were immediately seated and taken care by the waiter named Carlos. He was to quick to bring our drinks and gave us an appropriate amount of time to review the menu and place the order. He was very attentive and made sure to check on us regularly.
We got our food fairly quick. I was not impressed with the portioning of the chicken tenders I ordered. The amount of chicken tenders did not justify the price of the order. The fries were cold and the ranch seemed a little more watery than what I am used to.
Overall I was satisfied with our waiter and not so much about the portions for such a high price. I may be back to try something different, but I won't be back anytime soon.
I prefer Islands Burgers."}
{"text":"Why do so many people think this is a good franchise? These are the most bland, disappointing burgers I've ever had from any chain. Let me document the three tries I've given it.

Strike 1-Burger with Swiss cheese, cheddar cheese, sauteed mushrooms and bacon. Sounds like an amazing burger, but it was just bland and greasy.

Strike 2-Bleu Ribbon burger with onion straws, blue cheese, and steak sauce. I didn't know anything with blue cheese on it could still be so boring. Yawn.

Strike 3-A vegetarian quesadilla and guacamole bacon burger. The quesadilla looked awesome, stuffed with mushrooms and whatnot, but I had to dip it in guac to give my tastebuds the slightest hint of satisfaction. They should stop using cheap, mild cheese and maybe actually season the stuff instead of giving your 4 different toppings for it. Also, the burger sucked. It doesn't matter if it says \"Oregano seasoned patty\" or \"cayenne\" or whatever--they all taste the same. Not to mention telling the waitress \"well done\" and getting meat with plenty of pink.

I want to give you 1 star so bad, but you try to be good, especially with the vegetarian substitutions available. I hope your patrons wake up and realize there are exponentially better burgers in several locations within walking distance."}
{"text":"Service was SUPER slow! Took forever to get my smoothie from the bar and half the restaurant looked close and the half that was open was maybe at 50% seated. I used to love eating here in my hometown, even worked there for a little while. I don't know if it's this location or in general the food has gone downhill. The smoothie wasn't smooth at all and filled with ice chunks. Food was alright. I usually get bbq wrap but tried the chicken burger, bun was soggy! Would likely pick a different alternate then coming here again.  too bad cuz I used to like it but I just can't justify the cost for quality and service."}
{"text":"Had lunch at this location while visiting recently. I've never been to Red Robin before  so I was really looking forward to their burgers. Took about half an hour to get seated, but it was busy and at a mall location. Our initial waiter was nice, but the wait time for the food to arrive after we ordered took an hour. In that time I watched two tables finish their meals, and two new groups get seated and finish their entire meal before our food arrived. We had drank all our water while waiting so it would have been nice if our server came by to check on us and refill our water glasses. When the food finally did come it was delivered by the manager who apologized and blamed the cooks. A waitress came by a few minutes later with the sauces for our burgers. She said she noticed them in the kitchen and assumed it was part of our order. She seemed annoyed and unfriendly, but I couldn't tell if it was because of us or something else.

The burgers and fries were decent -- not great, but not bad. We could tell that some of the burgers had been sitting a while because they weren't warm at all. The milkshakes were amazing. I was starving so I wolfed down my \"bottomless\" fries. I wanted to get more fries but our waiter had completely disappeared at this point, and I wasn't sure how long it would take to bring more out. Our waiter did show up again at the end to bring us the bill. I wasn't the one who paid the bill, but I was disappointed it wasn't discounted since we had to wait an hour for the food, that hour wait affected the quality of the food, and the service was not that great.

When I've had bad experiences at other restaurants before, our bill was discounted/comped or we were offered some food as a make-good to make up for a bad dining experience, and those times weren't as ridiculous as our visit to this Red Robin.

Verdict: if you want a warm/fresh gourmet burger next time, you'd be better off ordering a Six Dollar Burger at Carl's Jr. Or really, any other fancy burger chain."}
{"text":"Red Robin has two steps of burgers, the regular with a price range around $11.50 and a gourmet menu with prices around $14:50. I don't think the few additions on the gourmet burgers make it worth  the price. 

I ordered one burger and a different one came out. Our waitress said she input the wrong burger. She offered to bring me what I ordered, but my timeline didn't allow for this. 

The guy beside me ordered the fried fish and it looked awesome. If you go to Red Robin and don't want a burger, this looks like it might be a great alternative."}
{"text":"The food is good!  The service is terrible! This is the second time this has happendend.  You can't get all of your order at one time, staff completely ignore guest, and when you are able to get there attention, they act clueless when you tell them \"I didn't get my soup\". Again, food is good but not worth the hassles"}
{"text":"Yummy birthday burger love mushroom Swiss and dipping sauce with fries.  They have mini tablet for kids.  My burger was cooked to perfection and gluten free bun is way yummy."}
{"text":"Gave the another shot and I must say the service was much better than the previous few visits. Food was good and cane fast. Didn't wait forever for my drinks like in the past either. Really had no complaints. It was good food and good service. Glad to see them getting it together because Red Robin is always a cool spot to hit for a burger and I randomly crave the salty fries. Might have to put Red Robin back in the rotation"}
{"text":"I am from Tucson. They closed the Red Robin we had. So I was excited to visit the Red Robin restaurant in Tempe. Everything was fine until I took a closer look at my chicken. It wasn't cooked all the way through. I just had a kidney transplant about 4 months ago. Eating under cooked meat of any kind can cause you to lose your Transplant. I was horrified, scared. The staff said sorry and gave me a new salad without chicken. They didn't seem worried with my reaction of sadness and gave us the check. It was the worst meal of my life. I hope I don't get really sick"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was not.

Red Robin must have been understaffed when I decided to take my out-of-state parents for dinner and dessert. Everything seemed to be in slow motion. We waited for our food to arrive and when it did we had no silverware or napkins. By the time we did get them, our food needed to be reheated.

If once wasn't enough, we ordered dessert and that took a very, very long time to arrive and when it did, we didn't have spoons. We waited and waited for spoons, but they never came. Finally, my dad had to go to the kitchen to get us spoons and he was given a dirty one.

My parents have been to several Red Robins throughout the US and they told me this was their worst experience.

I think I will pass the next time I am in the Northlake Mall area, there are plenty of other places to choose from."}
{"text":"This is a great burger place. I like a place where they feel comfortable serving you a pink hamburger. You know it's a good quality burger. It's not so good on the calories but who cares when you want to indulge on a good juicy burger. The only annoying thing is the \"happy Birthday\" cheers which gets very loud. I guess it's people's destination for their birthday celebration."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service-

The little snowflake girl upfront apparently took enjoyment out of ignoring us for nearly 5 minutes while the other hostess was helping a to-go order guest.
After she finally gave us the \"courtesy\" of acknowledging our presence when a group of maybe 4-5 college kids came in she asked for our name so we could wait to be seated while she sat the people that had literally just walked in............

Outstanding- appreciate the service..............."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Food took forever.
Hardly anyone in restaurant and the service was poor."}
{"text":"Having worked in so many restaurants before, service is something I always pay attention to when eating out. The service at Red Robin was terrible. We were not even acknowledged for 20 minutes. When we were finally greeted, it took another 10 minutes for us to get drinks. The manager tried to redeem herself and paid for our appetizers and took our order. Somehow my burger was still not cooked to order as I had specified. The server kept picking up our glasses and taking them instead of just refilling them. Then she wouldn't even bring them back. The only thing I ate was my fries. Tables around us received service and were in, fed and out long before we were. I just couldn't believe that that many servers just kept walking by us without even saying anything. Very disappointing. I won't be back."}
{"text":"What can I say?  I love Red Robin's burgers!  I'm not sure if all Red Robins are like this location, but it's nice that there's a full bar area to separate you from the regular crowd of families with lots of kids.  The drink menu has a lot of awesome little drinks like the Skinny Sweet Tea, and the Skinny Vodka Lemonade.  They were delicious.  

I usually get the bacon cheeseburger and substitute chipotle mayo instead of regular mayo.  Then I get onion rings instead of fries, with a side of onion ring sauce.  The burgers are always cooked perfectly and served hot.  I love the breading on the onion rings - very crispy and crunchy.  The onion ring sauce goes with ANYTHING.  My friends were dipping their burgers in the sauce, lol. 

Our service this past weekend was great!  Our server checked on us often and brought us everything we needed quickly.  She was great!"}
{"text":"The place was nice and clean, the staff friendly, but hard to get attention at times. Fries are good, the burgers were mediocre. The Ghost pepper sauce jalapeño variant packed some flavorful zing though."}
{"text":"We only go to Red Robin when nothing else is open.  We planned on going to Market Grille this past Sunday but it was closed SO we just went to RR.

The sandwiches are slathered with mayo and super messy.  Not worth the $11-12 per burger or sandwich they charge.

Go to Create for a better burger!!!"}
{"text":"DH and I went here after I got sucked in by the Mt. Olympus burger commercials on TV.  Neither of us had been to one before, so we figured we might as well try it out.

Our experience was good - we had a good waitress who was attentive.  She knew when to bring refills, when to stay away, and was a psychic when it came to knowing when my hubby needed napkins.  

I also want to mention the experience of a couple sitting nearby.  She had ordered a turkey burger and did not find it to her liking.  They offered to bring something else out to her immediately, for free.  They also offered to keep refilling her fries - for free.  They offered her a free dessert, a free shake - free ANYTHING.  The waitress and then the manager.

I have seen some negative reviews about the customer service at this place - so I just want to mention:  If something bothers you, mention it.  I would be willing to bet they fix it.  Immediately.

We both enjoyed our food, had a pleasant dining experience, and got to overhear how we would have been treated had we not been happy.  Solid 4-star experience."}
{"text":"Sat down to eat after my daughters gymnastics meet, we've been waiting 30 minutes to order and never got a waitress, absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers - yummy shakes -very friendly but kind of inept staff- sloppy service - but the kids live the table top games and I can live with the service - cons here expecting pretty good burgers - fries and shakes and assume slow and average service and you will be fine"}
{"text":"What an awful experience for my sons 8th bday. Our server (who did not have a name tag on, but was told by the mgr Christine that her name was Tanya) did not greet us or ask if we had eaten there before. She annoyingly asked for our beverage orders and when I started listing the kids first she told me she had to go in order so she wouldn't take all the kids drinks at once. Once our beverage order was taken she offered the onion ring tower, so far so good. She then brings the adult beverages and says the kids is coming up and she'll bring straws then, she then proceeds to ask for our order. As a party of 6 we were in a long booth, I placed the children's order (grilled cheese and fries, cheese pizza and fries, and a regular PLAIN cheeseburger for my eldest, not a kids meal), then placed my order of a bacon cheddar burger with onion straws and no tomato, I also added the mini wedge salad with Italian instead of ranch, my husband ordered a turkey club with fries and a clam chowder, my father was seated furthest from her and when she looked at him he asked for a party melt. She had been having a hard time hearing our orders and thought he said he needed more time. I repeated that he wanted a patty melt. One of my sons decided that he may want a different side but when he said something she just walked away. She never asked any of us how we wanted our burgers cooked. She never asked my father his choice or cheese or if the side he chose was fries. She just walked away. I called her back to verify that he wanted American cheese on his patty melt and fries, she looked irritated. A few minutes later she came back to say that the fountain drink machine was out of syrup and they were working on it (5 min prior she had already told a different table, but not ours). Someone brought out my salad...with ranch dressing. I mentioned I wanted Italian so she took it back no problems. My server then brought out the children's drinks. She then said that the kitchen was working on my salad. She then brought out the same salad (still with ranch dressing on it and my thumb print in a bit that was on the side of the bowl) with Italian dressing on the side. I mentioned that 1) it was the same salad and 2) it still had ranch dressing. She told me that that's what the kitchen handed back to her. Seeing as how we had already waited 25 min I just took it and then noticed we had no silverware. She brought ONE fork and walked away. I called her back as I needed a knife since it was a wedge salad. She huffed and said \"I'll bring it out!! We are super busy and they're still being washed!!\" She then walked passed several times...none of those times did she bring my husbands clam chowder. She then dropped off a HANDFUL of silverware that was just in her bare hands. Not wrapped, not in a napkin, just her hands on the tines of the fork and palm on the blades of the knives. She seriously dropped them in the middle of the table. She then brought out my husbands soup. Next up came our food... My PLAIN cheeseburger (that I explained was PLAIN, no lettuce, condiments, pickles) was loaded with lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickles. I was going to just pick it off, but noticed that mayo was on the bun. I asked if she could bring a new bun. She grabbed the plate from my hands and said she'd have a new one made. At this point we'd been there for 45 min. I gave up and said fine. She then gave me my burger, the onion straws were on the side. She knew they weren't a side item as she verified when she took my order that I wanted fries. I asked her why they were on the side and she had no idea and again said, that's what the kitchen handed her. She then proceeded to tell me that my attitude was uncalled for. I then LISTED that she got my order incorrect twice, didn't wait to hear my son's pizza side, did ask about cheese or fries for the patty melt order, got the PLAIN cheeseburger incorrect. She YELLED \"none of that's my fault, the kitchen did it\". That was the final straw, Christine, an employee in a black shirt I'm assuming is a mgr, finally stepped in and took over. At this point my husband was disgusted that the server had bare palmed our silverware, and I was fed up that more than half our order kept getting messed up. Christine dismissed the server and tried to replace our order but at the time being 6:15 (we walked in at 5:05) I had had enough. I explained the problems and the servers attitude and inattentiveness since she had first 'not-greeted' us. I mentioned the great servers we had had in the past and the helpfulness of our hostesses.  Christine offered us a gift card for our troubles and then we left."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Red Robin. We always have seated ourselves in the bar. We have always gotten great service and the best food in any Red Robin that we have been to. Each time we have been in a manager has popped by the table and checked to see that we have been served correctly and if there were any issues which needed to be addressed. It's always been great!!"}
{"text":"I love Red robin. The only reason they lose a star is the food is kinda pricy for some items and i'm not a huge fan of the french fries. I always used to order the blue ribbon burger.. so good! but in later years I've been trying to behave and have ordered the cobb salad here 2x. If you are looking for healthier options.. under 500 calories. Good luck, go somewhere else. But.... hear me out.... this place's Cobb Salad is 533 calories not counting dressing and the bread they serve with it. I love their website that counts all the calories and you can modify to calculate every single thing you put in your mouth. down to the lettuce... yes down to the lettuce. Its a must try! 
Also note. if you are looking for this place its not on the outskirts of the mall it is in the mall.. The 1st time we were looking for it we didnt see it so we went to BWW. (always a winner)  But this has great burgers and other options."}
{"text":"I usually like this place or crave a burger from here until I'm actually there and then automatically regret the decision every. single. time. It's always at this location too. I decided to give it another shot today and well, you probably know what I'm gonna say. The service was terrible for it not being as busy. Our order took forever and my croissant from my sandwich was flaky and dry and just poorly made. Then when it came time to pay the table kiosk decided to not work at all. It took a whole 5 mins of trying to get someone's attention. So many employees walked by and nothing. Finally our server came by and took care of it. I think I'm finally done with this location which sucks because it's so, so close to home."}
{"text":"This location is old, fairly dirty and decor that has not been updated in many years. The food was very mediocre and not up to the same standards as other Red Robin's.  There are many choices for mid-priced burgers in this area that are a better overall value."}
{"text":"Went in for Veterans Day as the offered free burgers today.  Well. Not impressed with the burger.  It was cheaply made with a square of lettuce that wasn't even as big as the super thin patty.  They got the burger wrong (I wanted no pickles) and the second one was just as bad.  Thanks for giving back to vets but next time make it something we actually want to eat.  Should have gone to hooters for free wings. They are usually pretty good."}
{"text":"We normally enjoy Red Robin and one of our favorite things is the fries. We had never been to this location but stopped for a quick lunch. The fries were terrible. They were mushy and we didn't even finish the side order that came with our burgers. We won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate the remodel. There is enough separation and segregation in the world. The restaurant industry should not promote it. If you dine with kids be prepared to keep them in check (I raised 4 boys). If you're out on a date, keep in mind the \"family\" atmosphere that used to be one of the things we came to Red Robin for.  Sorry guys, you just lost a regular customer to your North Olmsted location. I hope this isn't happening at all of your locations. And BTW, the track lighting shining in my eyes was completely annoying!  Can't speak to the food yet as we have sat here for 25 minutes waiting for it."}
{"text":"Aside from the nice waitress I was very disappointed. Always loved Red Robin but not this location. Food was edible but not that great dishes and flat ware weren't that clean. Would not recommend to family and friends. Most likely will not return to this location on future visits"}
{"text":"The place has been remodeled. I think that they are searching for a new identity in this very over crowded hamburger joint market. Over the past years they were much better, now the high prices do not warrant anymore visits from myself. The Blue Ribbon burger ( not sure that the name is correct) had just a few crumbs of blue cheese and the serving portion of blue cheese dressing was less than half full , about the amount that would fit in a thimble. While the burger it's self was very good, the price of $15.99 is was not. Just had water and with the tip & tax $21.61 for just one person. Without a doubt my last visit."}
{"text":"I shouldn't even be giving this place 1 star.. That's being generous! 

We were the first people to walk into the restaurant of 3 groups the same size as ours and were the last to be seated. We waited 5-10 minutes to be sat in a almost empty restaurant. Then waited another 10 minutes to even see our waitress to put in a drink order. Noticing how slow the service was going we figured we should put in our food order as well. We didn't receive our food for 40 minutes. You wouldve thought we had the most complicated order ever!! A regular burger shouldn't take that long. Needless to say we're unsatisfied and didn't see our waitress again until the check arrived. We were never checked in on or asked if we needed anything. This is the worse customer service I have ever received in a long time. And I am sympathetic when it comes to less than par customer service if there are special circumstances (busy day, understaffing, etc.) but there was no reason for this HORRIBLE customer service."}
{"text":"We just received our delivery from Red Robin, and I am not impressed. I expected and knew the French fries wouldn't be AS great as they are in the restaurant, but we live 5 minutes from Tempe Marketplace and the food sat at our home for *maybe*  5 minutes before we sat down to eat and the fries were completely soggy.

I ordered fish fillets and fries, and received fish and shrimp with fries. I asked for no tartar sauce, and it was still included. There was small pieces of cheese stuck on the bottom of my fish.

My boyfriend got the A1 peppercorn burger with NO tomatoes, and there were still tomatoes on the burger.

There was only 1 seasoning packet (the salt for the fries), when there were 2 entrees which was odd.

The only good thing about our meal was the quick delivery and our delivery man being very friendly.

Will not be returning to or ordering from this location again, which is unfortunate because it's one of our favorite chain places to go."}
{"text":"The best turkey burger ever. The food is always good here a wonderful verity of burgers and of course bottomless fries if that is your thing.
I would not recommand going durning busy times the place is a little crazy."}
{"text":"Lunch went downhill today ... we were hungry and decided to stop at Red Robin.  To begin with, I had to ask the server to wipe off the table.  The place had just opened for lunch and all the tables looked like they had been hastily wiped down from the night before and put out to the pasture to dry.  Even the menus were sticky.  Gross.  Burgers were just \"OK\".  Lots of sloppy sauce.  Nothing to write home about. Meh.  I ate the meat and left the bun.  $22 for two burgers.  We won't be back.  

PS- This place needs a good cleaning."}
{"text":"This location is a joke. The bartender/ \"waitress\" has horrible service she's rude. There is a reason this location has 3 stars. Mind you, it was the second time we visited this  location. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"its a chain. the burgers are OK. the service is OK. there are plenty of places around for better real burgers but as far as chains go, this is an ok place. if you want a burger, you can get  one here. that my mediocre review for a mediocre place."}
{"text":"I can't imagine anyone rating this 5 stars.  Three maybe but five?
This is a chain burger joint - and the burgers are about 10 bucks.  The staff was attentive.  The food not terrible. And they have \"endless\" fries.
If you need to watch the calories -- watch out here.  They put mayo or some other sauce on all the burgers.

Probably good for families with kids - if you have the $$$$."}
{"text":"This place opened up in the Galleria Mall about 10 years back. While a national chain, I had never heard of it prior to this. 

I had been missing out.

Red Robin is American-style food at its finest. The place has an upbeat, colorful atmosphere, along with a few arcade games. The menu is pretty diverse, and it's highly unlike you'll be coming here and not finding something that appeals to you. They even have shakes/malts, and I guarantee they will be some of the finest you have ever tasted. The place has excellent fries, and with pretty much any food item you paid for you get an unlimited supply during your meal. Not bad for all the people that can't get enough food.

The service tends to be a bit hit-and-miss at times. Sometimes I have gone for minutes on end with no one coming to me. During one visit I didn't even get my malt until after I had received my food! Plus, they are terrible at taking the request of not including ranch with your chicken fingers - and this IS a big deal, considering it is an unsealed container and CAN spill out onto them.

Still, the faults are minor in the long run. I've been going to this place since they opened up here, and probably always will. Nothing is so wrong with this place that it will keep me away. I have to give this place a strong recommendation overall."}
{"text":"This newly placed burger shop is positioned right near main entrance to the mall across from Barnes & Nobles. They have a nice layout with plenty of seating and a some really comfy chairs if you get the cushioned back ones.

We sat just inside the entrance about 4 tables in. Its a bad seating choice for the winter since their double doors let in all the cold air from the outside. I was forced to wear my coat there the whole time. Bummer! The hockey game was on so I was fortunate enough to be able to face the TV when we were seated. We ordered right away, I got the beer float which was awesome.  So vanillay and beery but a great combination of both. The orange juice and orange liqueur they added made it taste just like a beer orange-sicle smoothie!! 

Our food had its ups and downs. The bottomless sides and flavor of the toppings is very generous but my chicken burger and his angus were quite opposites. I ordered the chicken blue which comes with blue cheese, onion straws, aioli and the standard fixins. He ordered the black n pepper angus with the usual toppings, bacon and cheese. L,T,O. He ordered medium and it came out so juicy and full of flavor. It tasted exactly like what a classic burger would taste like. My chicken burger was good but not great. The chicken was warm and the toppings kinda blended into each other too well that everything was masked over the taste of the blue cheese. I wish I could have tasted the onion straws and aioli sauce better.

The service was great, our waitress beverly was always making sure we had whatever we needed. Another downside though is that the servers who brought out the food didn't know which table to send it too. Twice when we were ordering beverly had to pause us to tell the servers which table the food belonged at. Then while we were eating a random women brought food to our table assuming it was ours. Part of me was going to accept it but I declined and told her she had the wrong table.

At the conclusion of our evening we decided on dessert which we rarely do. Got some red velvet cake. It came with strawberry sauce but it was very thick. Me and the hubby shared it but after the sauce ran out the cake was way too thick for me to eat. 

I'd recommend the mixed drinks and the angus burger. Maybe the turkey but I haven't tried it yet. They have a large selection of burger styles to choose from so you won't be disappointed. And there are plenty of sides. Some are bottomless and others aren't."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch on a Monday.   No lines.  However we waited over 20 minutes for a waitress to arrive.   Eventually moved ourselves to the bar area.  Immediately served.  I have been to other red Robin restaurants in the area and service is usually great.   There is a real problem at this location.  Be Forwarded.   The reviews are accurate."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Red Robin in over two years. Decided that was the place to go last night.

Arrived just before 9:00 PM. San Tan was very crowded with people leaving from some event that was over. Thought possibly there would be a wait time at Red Robin. When coming through the doors there wasn't anyone a head of us, but the hostess still asked for the name of our party/ phone # & that it would be about 15 mins until we could be seated. It was only about 3 mins.

Started with the traditional wings which comes on a bed of chips. They were pretty good, yet seemed to be small in size. My husband ordered the Smoked Pepper Burger (A1 sauced) was good but pricey. I had the the Whiskey BBQ Burger ( Red Tavern). It's two very thin patties ( which would equal one) with a whisky BBQ sauce added with lettuce and tomato. It was just ok. Price was fair for what you get. It's a smaller burger than the Fire House Style yet for what you paid for that it's not a large burger either. Burgers range from $6.99 Tavern , Gourmet $8.99 then up to $13 for the Fire House.

Only plus it's ordering the Fire House Style is you can get endless fries. Keep in mind that they come in a small round tin when served, then in a basket if you have another round, in our case, the 2nd order of fries took about 20 mins cause they were forgotten. If you order a side salad in place of any other side there is NO CHARGE! 

At the table is an electronic devise that is a \"pay as you leave system\" when you are finish dinning. There is other functions & interactions on this machine. If you opt to play any games, you will be charged $1.99 or more depending on what you choose.

Our server was ok, she had a great personality so we'll let  the flaw with the fries go. With that said, I doubt we will be back in the future. Since it's been a few years; it seems prices have increased and portions have decreased."}
{"text":"Waited an eternity for our food. Bottomless fries aren't bottomless when the waiter never comes back to your table. This place is SO loud."}
{"text":"I am giving the review of the food i ate. This is a fast food chain so don't expect any difference in the ambiance. I ordered the ensanada chicken platter, You get two chicken breasts with salsa and salad. Chicken breasts were hot and tender :). 
Salsa was really tasty and i wished i could get more or try it out with some chips :P. 
Lemonade is decent not that sweet which i liked."}
{"text":"My first experience at this place and I really enjoyed it. Excellent and prompt service, cool ambience, yummy gourmet burgers and steak fries.. great variety on the menu, not just burgers. Awesome selections on the kids menu as well.  Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"This was the first time that I've been to a Red Robin.  I thought the burger & fries were slightly better then average. I had a burger, fries, and a drink for around $18.  Customer service was great."}
{"text":"Kids seem to really love this place. Took the grandchildren for their birthdays and it was OK. We had 1 appetizer, 5 burger platters & 1 child's portion. The cost was almost $100.00. Pretty pricey for burgers!!!! 
The atmosphere is LOUD! You have to talk really loud to be heard across the table."}
{"text":"The server was friendly and patient with us as she took our food order and brought us our drinks. As we were sitting and chatting we noticed time had passed and we still didn't have our food. We also saw that a group who was seated after us received there food before us. Once we asked our server what was taking so long she said it would be sooner, then 30 seconds, then it actually took another 10-15 for it to come out. The manager came over and told us the kitchen was behind. That's all. No apology, no sincerity. After that the server was flippant and avoided our table. Not sure I'll be back here unless I've got plenty oftime to kill."}
{"text":"Friendly service. .. decent burger and fries.  

Today we had the smoked pepper bacon burger.  Tasty.. with the reliable fries. Also had a mini tower of onion rings.... very good with the dipping sauces

Our waitress was paying attention to stuff and our sodas stayed full... and we got the extra fries (I will eat them even if I don't want them. .. Because bottomless fries are their  \"thing\".

Always a safe, if not inspired stop"}
{"text":"The server was nice and all but the service leaves a lot to be desired. I took a seat at the bar after looking for a stool that didn't have the previous customer's dirty dishes and napkins.  There wasn't any so I sat in front of a dirty dish and glass for over five minutes before the area in front of me was bussed and I was offered a menu and a beer.  

It took an unusually long time for my Pig Out Tavern Burger to arrive and when it did, the bun was all soggy. The burger tasted okay but \"okay\" is about as good as it gets. Definitely not worth $8.45.  I wasn't in the mood for fries tonight so I substituted broccoli and that was a bit over done and slightly mushy. 

The best I can say for Red Robin at the Waterfront is that it sports a full bar but the craft beers here are limited. I was there for about 45 minutes and during that whole time, the bar wasn't bussed once and I dined next to a used empty glass. 

This place is either severely understaffed or miss managed (or both). With all the competition here at the Waterfront I don't see how Red Robin stays in business."}
{"text":"This place is filthy. They remodeled it not long ago and don't know how to keep it clean. Every time I come here we are sat at a dirty table. Never fails leftover food on the table and booth. Dust all over the wood by the booth. I can't imagine what the kitchen looks like. Says a lot about the management not caring. I am not returning to this location."}
{"text":"The booth we sat in was broken... Basically the spring was missing... So I just sank into it. But the food was quick and good. They have the electronic menus on the table so you can order an appetizer, call your server, or pay quickly with ease. We had a five minute wait, even though the restaurant was half empty."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying \" Red Robin..... YUM.....\" 

Red robin has an array of burgers from chicken to beef. I was here for my nieces birthday party on busy Sunday night and for a party of 8 we only waited 15 mins. 

Once we sat down the server took a couple minutes to come greet us. However we did notice people ordering drinks and appetizers from the new tablet they have at every table top. Although it's pretty neat to have if you want a refill or to get your waiters attention I think it replaces the waiter and you don't get the one on one attention right away like normal. 

Once we got our servers attention she was very quick to bring our burgers out and was overall accommodating when we kept asking for refills on the bottomless and endless refills of steak fries.  I ordered the whiskey bbq burger with an over easy egg and it was delicious and runny and filled with fatty flavors. 
 For dessert I got doughnut holes that came with chocolate syrup it was a perfect but heavy treat to end dinner"}
{"text":"Red robin!!! Yummmmm! I have been getting the usual since i can remember! Blt and bottomless fries with ranch and a strawberry lemonade! I dont think ive ever had bad food frok red robin! I would definitely recommend trying!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Red Robin for a really long time and we decided to give it a try tonight. I guess I would describe this place as a family friendly burger joint. A lot different from Paradise Valley Burger Company, Hop Doddy, and Zin Burger. All are gourmet burgers but RR is a family friendly with lots of bright colors, always kids and I guess reasonable prices. 

Our server was pretty good in greeting us, getting our drinks, and taking our order. Not bad. 

I ordered the Smoke & Pepper Burger. Nice thick juicy burger with bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, pickles with a nice BBQ ketchup. Not bad. I thought that it was pretty good with a little kick to it. Also, comes with steak fries. They give you a little bit of fries but then again they have bottomless fries. You just have to ask for more. 

My wife ordered the fish & chips. It came with four good sized pieces of fish. And nice portion of steak fries. The fish was moist and tender. Tasted pretty good and filled my wife. As for my son, he ordered the Whiskey River BBQ chicken salad. Chicken and avocado in the salad over a BBQ salad dressing. He had to ask for more BBQ dressing but he loved it. Ate it all. So must have been good cause he such a picky eater. 

So good food, decent service (not great but not bad either cause I had to ask for refills), and a very interesting ambiance. It's very loud. Not super fun but family loud atmosphere. Young and old. So I enjoyed it. Like I said if your looking for a different atmosphere from the other burger joints then this is the place for you. Plus it looks like they have good desserts even though I didn't try them. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I am super annoyed tonight. I am updating my review of this location to 1 star. 

Let me say, my kids and I used to come to this location literally about one a week, several years ago. It has drastically gone downhill over time. 

My little one for some reason remembered that this location has a chalk board in the lobby when we were walking through the parking lot. Got inside, only to realize they are out of chalk. First disappointment. 

We were seated, and the hostess didn't give my little one any crayons or paper like they normally do. We asked the server, and we were told they are also out of crayons, but that the manager was trying to find some in the back. Second disappointment. 

I ordered the freckled lemonade, which was very watered down, and only had 2 pieces of strawberry in it. Third disappointment. 

I ordered the Royal burger, no bacon, with a veggie patty. The burger came out with 2 giant pieces of bacon it. Normally I would ask the kitchen to remake the burger, but based on my last experience last week at this same location, I didn't bother. 

Side note, last week I ordered the croissant blta, no bacon. Of course, the sandwich came out with bacon on it. I asked them to remake the sandwich, and it was brought out just a few moments later. I took off the top piece of croissant to see, and sure enough, there were 2 holes where the wooden sticks had been put through the sandwhich. They didn't remake anything, just removed the bacon. I could have done that myself I guess. Good thing I'm not allergic! 

Back to this visit. Ate my food, and drank my water I had ordered in place of the lemonade. Decided to order dessert to go. I ordered the freckled lemonade cake. I have had this dessert about 4 times now. 

Well, I just opened my cake and there is no strawberry sauce or strawberries! Seriously?!? Isn't that the point?

I told the manager about most of this when she stopped by our table. She didn't have much to say other than \"I'm sorry\" and \"we will try to do better.\" Then she took our $4 onion rings off of the bill.  Ugh. 

I am really disappointed. We used to come all the time, and have been customers since this location opened in 2005. We most likely won't be going back for a while. The service has slowly been declining. They won't even take your payment if you are using a debit card. You have to do it yourself on the little kiosk things. Super annoying."}
{"text":"The food was great and the server was awesome. However everyone else not so much.

We waited 45 minutes for a table and it was just me and my daughter. The hostess said 20 mins when we checked in so we went to the car to get something for my daughter to do.

Gone maybe 5 mins. Then waited and finally asked someone. She said that she couldn't find my name on list.

Then the girl that took my name find my name and said someone must have said we were a walk out. Huh?

She never admitted that she did it, but you could tell that she was caught in a lie. Other lady seated us and said a manager would talk to us.

Guess what no manager stopped by and during the meal the hostess that made us wait 45 mins walked by us to talk to a bus boy and didn't even apologize. She's obviously doesn't care about customers and I guess the same could be said about management there.

Worst part is that my daughter really wanted to eat here because it was our date night, her choice.

I doubt that anyone will follow up...so be warned that operations related to customer service is terrible, food good. Be ready to wait like we did!"}
{"text":"I walked in, placed an order TO GO, and sat and waited for a 1/2 hour, while my server (bartender) who not only took my order, but passed me 30+ times during order runs forgot that I actually ordered food.  

A bag with some food was delivered to the bar counter about 10 minutes after I placed the order, little did I know it was MY ORDER.  I couldn't tell what was inside, nor was it my job- did the bartender look, check the order?  

NO.

As I waited, looking at the unclaimed to-go order, I kept telling myself, \"no one can possibly be this dumb, no way- I've only  placed the order thru her and been in her line of sight for 1/2 hour now, and it's busy, maybe it's just taking a bit, no way, this is too obvious\"

It took a stray server walking by who noticed a to-go order sitting on the counter unclaimed, me sitting at a nearby table, no food just a glass of water for a length of time to finally get it together.

Absolute lunacy.   One Star."}
{"text":"New decor is nice but quality has gone down :( both mine and my husbands burgers were clearly patty's from frozen. Not much of a step up from burger king other than a bigger bun."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and have tried burgers from multiple menus and honestly they are barely step up from burger king. The only good thing about this place is their unlimited fries and dipling sauces."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Red Robin I didn't like...If you are crazy about Burgers...then this is the place for you...they are thick...they are fresh...with fresh condiments and an endless amount of crispy Steak Fries...My favorite is the Teriyaki Burger...their Chicken Strips and Fish & Chips are excellent also...restaurants always clean and staff is always nice...I just wish there was a restaurant closer to Sierra Vista..the Tuscon location closed...making Phoenix the closest...booo!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the best part of this meal is......LEAVING....... pale COLD fries, so an endless basket of them is no prize. There was something clumpy/doughy in the clams chowder, the wedge salad was like it had been sitting around for a long while. We ask for fries that were cooked and we get hard over done ones, like trying to be wise. Oh well, won't be seeing us again."}
{"text":"Went in on a sat night. 5 min wait but restaurant was not busy.  Fast friendly service. Fries came right away drinks kept full and great attention anticipating needs. One of our favorite consistent go-to restaurants."}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome Bottomless fries are useless everything else is too big to even eat more than 1 order of anything"}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner this evening, with about 16 people. The restaurant didn't seem to packed and everything seemed to start off ok. We all started receiving our food and my son ordered a kids meal I hand him his plate and there was dry ketchup all over the bottom of his plate. So the plate was clearly dirty but the top seemed fine so I was not going to say anything. I then received my food and the same, the bottom of the plate looked dirty. So i speak up and tell the waiter. My mom gets a soup and the spoon is dirty. My sister gets a salad and while eating it finds a hair. Then we had an order that the waiter put in wrong and we also ordered a soup we never received. At this point I'm just over the whole dinner. I go find the manger and he seemed to not truly care. He said he would take care of desert and remove the messed up items from the checks as my sister and i didn't want our food fixed. We order desert and that even takes about 25 mins to get. As a manager i would have at least had this expedited as the whole meal was a disaster for us. I got cheese cake and it was frozen. The waiter seemed to truly be sorry as most of this was out of his hands. I just wish the manager would of seemed to care more. Even when leaving I walk right by him and he says absolutely nothing to us. We definitely won't be back to this one. Tempe Marketplace has much better service if your really wanting Red Robin."}
{"text":"Daniel was an excellent waiter.  Service was quick! Food was at the right temperature. 
Fiance enjoyed his Smokey Jack Tavern Burger with bottomless fries. Yes, they did serve a small amount of fries but, why have more than you can eat! You can order more if need be. I had soup & salad. French Onion soup was tasty but, very salty. As much salad as you can handle.  All & all it was a very nice experience. Will return on our next visit to The Mayo Clinic."}
{"text":"Service is atrocious,  management is no better!   Seated promptly by a very friendly hostess and a server came right away,  took our drink and appetizer order and told us he wished he didn't have to hand us off because we looked like a good table but he was changing shifts (carlton)... daughter got her milkshake pretty quickly,  10 minutes go by the new server appears and confirms our appetizer and drink order and takes our food order.  Goes to the bar to check on our beers, 5 minutes later comes back to say the keg is to cold and it can't be poured.   No problem!  He then asks if we would like water, good upsell by the way, we suggest bottles.  10 minutes later he comes back to say they don't carry bottles.  We still have no appetizers,  no food,  no drinks (not even water!).  We tell him to cash us out on the milkshake and ask for the manager.   She comes to the table, what a joke!  We enjoy this place usually but after this experience,  NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. It's nice to be able to sit in the bar area and eat, kid free zone! Bar service is always good and they always have the game(s) on! Great for a casual night out in a Vegas bar without all the smoke!"}
{"text":"Horriable service, app came out after the meal, the place wasn't even busy... What a joke."}
{"text":"Great onion rings tower my favorite!!! Plus a waitress name Brooke is awesome to me and my family yesterday. She is in training and be upfront, I couldn't tell at all if she was new. I was very please to have her as my waitress!!! Thank you for hiring a great person (Brooke). 

Thank you,
Jayson Wells"}
{"text":"We had a big group of 18 people so I went in a few days before to talk to the hostess to see if they would save a table for a certain time since they do not take reservations.  All went well with seating and hostess was really nice and helpful!!  The server did a fine job but did have other tables so he was pretty overwhelmed and forgot items...but we totally understood how busy he was so that is not really the issue.  The issue I have was with my order.  I ordered Chicken Wings and French Onion Soup.  The soup was seriously served in a small saucer with very little soup.  The bread had soaked up all of the soup and the saucer was so shallow that there was no soup left. Seems like a strange choice of a dish for soup. I would recommend serving it in a BOWL or at least a ramekin so that there is soup instead of just bread soaked with soup and cheese. I returned it and would warn against anyone ordering that soup in the future....it is not worth it.  The fries were also pretty limp after asking for them to be extra crispy. It was just a Meh experience."}
{"text":"Hadn't been at this location for a while, and sorry that I came back.  Food was so-so and the service was bad.  \"Bottomless\" fries took so long to come to our table o was ready to leave, but I had drinks come to the table faster than we could drink them.  Basically I'll never come back to this location again."}
{"text":"well the bottomless fries are bottomless cause they never bring them to you.  although I like going here for the burgers,  I find them very stingy with the first order and takes them a long time to refill.  The back ground music is to loud to have a normal conversation."}
{"text":"I really like going to red robin, there burgers are usually fresh and juicy, and they have a lot of options for burger,  my only complaint is their bottomless fry's are really not bottomless because it like pulling teeth to get refills or for that mater what they bring to you to begin with.   I understand that its a cost saving thing but be realistic then and charge for them and have a decent amount served to the table.  love the fry's just not the game to get them"}
{"text":"Wow!!! What a difference from the last time we ate here! Our server, Ryan, was terrific, super friendly and a lot of fun. His attitude was really contagious and we quickly realized that there was a HUGE difference from our last visit. Ryan kept our glasses full and our burgers were served promptly, hot, and as ordered. We had a great time tonight and will definitely be back!! Thanks Ryan for making our Friday night out so enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I wanted to post and share that this location has upped their takeout game. Now, when I call I get accurate times! And, on my most recent pickup, the bartender brought me out fries to go and packets of their seasoning."}
{"text":"This Red Robin was a solid four-star experience, but compared to the San Tan location it was an forty-star experience. Service was impeccable, because they had appropriate staffing levels (at San Tan it is hard to spot a waiter). And I'm glad that they didn't insist on putting me in the bar just because I don't have kids, like San Tan. Finally, and most important, the restaurant and visible parts of the kitchen were actually clean!"}
{"text":"We tried to call in a to-go order twice and we were placed on hold for 5 minutes one time and 4 minutes the second time. By this point we had already made it to the restaurant so decided to just go in and place the order. It was pretty simple. 1 avo-cobo salad. After a 40 minute wait we finally got the salad (which had been sitting for awhile). So of course we spoke with the manager who in turn gave us an apology and a $20 gift card. Mind you, we'd already paid for the salad ($11.77) so it wasn't much of a GIFT considering it wouldn't even cover the cost of a new salad after the difference. Nonetheless, we were happy with the offer and went home to eat. Opened the salad... And the lettuce was wilted and filled with water in the bottom of the container. I called back in to speak with the manager who was kind enough to put in a rush order for not only 1 but 2 new salads and said to still keep the gift card. Thanks, Jim! The only decent part about our red robin experience was the manager who did his best to remedy the issue."}
{"text":"Just tried this place today for the first time ever. We got seated quickly. The hostess went on and on about a menu that we didn't asked to hear about. 
Our server was great. She was very attentive and checked up on us frequently. She was also polite and energetic. 
I give it 4 stars because the burger I got was not good. The sauce tasted like ketchup! 
However, everything else was great, so I'd be willing to try it again!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Red Robin for some time now and they are consistently good in many areas.  This is one chain restaurant that always has great service, food and prices. I almost always get a burger when I'm there, Of course!!! My absolute favorite is the burnin' love burger!! It is absolutely delicious and always cooked just the way I want it.  If I am feeling healthy I will opt for a side salad or veggies, but lets be honest it's hard to pass up the UNLIMITED FRIES!! I usually ask to get mine a little extra crispy.  It is hard to stop eating these golden delights.  The seasoning they have sitting on the table is super yummy sprinkled on the fries. 
One of their newer features is wine or beer milkshakes! (something different)

If you are in the mood for a good burger, Red Robin is always a good choice"}
{"text":"We love Red Robin, though sometimes skip it as it's very family friendly and tends to get loud and filled with kids.  Yesterday husband I stopped by on Sunday night and it wasn't full of screaming kids, so we decided to get our burger fix on!  

Husband and I each got our drink on, him with a Blue Moon beer and me with a strawberry margarita.  We started with a full onion tower which was delicious!  It came with ranch and some other sort of spicier sauce which was awesome!  For burgers I got my usual which I'm ADDICTED to...whiskey river BBQ burger with a garden patty.  

Let me pause to say how wonderful Red Robin is to us non meat eaters!!!  You can pick a garden burger (my fav!) or Boca which is beyond cool.  I love how every burger on the menu can be served with one of these meatless goodies!  

My carnivore husband devoured his bacon cheese burger.  The bonus, bottomless fries!  You can not beat that!  We ate until we couldn't eat anymore.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were here for dinner with a friend and his 2 year old daughter. Getting dinner to our table too a bit of time, but it was Saturday night. We asked for our fries to come out first (having a feeling food would take a while), they did - were cold, but they did. Our food finally came, and my order was cold (chicken bruschetta sand which). They took it back and fixed it promptly. The manager came over and apologized, and made sure my next order was adequate in temperature. All in all, just a typical \"ok\" experience. Will I be back? Most likely due to the kid friendly atmosphere - but I do feel like the food is starting to get a little pricy for the quality."}
{"text":"I had the chicken wrap n it was very tasty!! It was Very good choice. Didn't make me feel stuffed up at all. Very light. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Red Robin is a go-to chain restaurant spot in my book! Service is good, prices are decent and the burgers and chicken sandwiches are 1000 times better than you would expect at a well known chain restaurant. All burgers and sandwiches come with bottomless steak fries.

Secret: Order ranch on the side for your fries. You're welcome!

My only complaint is that they recently re-branded their restaurants to make them more modern and trendy, which is good but this means they do not wrap their burger and sandwiches anymore... making everything pretty messy. Grab some extra napkins."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving one star is for the outstanding service by Jason!!!! His demeanor was friendly and fun. 

A couple hours after my meal I was in the bathroom for the duration of the day and evening. I have never had such a horrible case of food poisoning in my 50 years. It only lessened with a 330 am trip to the emergency room. 

My husband called Red Robin and all we got was a thank you for calling. I would have liked my meal refunded. The lack of caring we received was unacceptable. 

Beware of the turkey burger and coleslaw. I won't ever be eating there again!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have been going to red robin for like over 20 years. I just went last night and was so terribly disappointed. The portions have become so much smaller than they used to be. I used to look forward to treating myself to a really good juicy burger...not do last night. Service was ok, food was just...kind of bland...didn't wow me. I was so disappointed I doubt I will ever go back."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Red Robin in many years, but having been given a gift card, we had a good reason to eat there. We visited on a Tuesday at 11:30am. The place was already busy and getting busier by the minute. The hostess sat us and no one came by our table for over ten minutes. We had time to review the whole menu, and it's a long menu, and then spent a few minutes trying to catch a server's eye. I really needed water. Our server finally introduced himself and we placed our full order. Our service was fine after that.

We tried the pretzel bites as an appetizer. They weren't bad, but the texture inside wasn't that chewy. They were VERY hot on the outside, so that was in their favor. I told my husband, \"They must have a really good heat lamp back there.\" The cheese dip wasn't that good. It was watered down Cheez Whiz, basically.

I had the southwestern salad with grilled chicken. I asked for no jalapeno coins and for my dressing to be on the side, and it came out as requested. The salad was okay, though I make better at home. It was watery beneath the salad greens.

My husband liked his hamburger, but his overall opinion was it was \"okay.\" He much prefers Smashburger or Five Guys, which are also cheaper. Red Robin serves fewer fries on the side than they used to, which was quite fine, really, and makes sense since they offer bottomless fries. Our server did come by to ask if he wanted more fries.

The food just didn't stand out to me. I realized I haven't missed Red Robin at all. We have plenty of other restaurants nearby that offer better and cheaper food, though this ended up being pleasant enough as a little lunch date for us."}
{"text":"We happened to be in Monona and we were looking for a place to eat.  We normally grab lunch or dinner at the Noodles & Co. there, but I didn't want to for a few reasons (I wanted more food for my buck and I wanted to sit with \"normal\" people in a COMFORTABLE atmosphere), so we decided to try Red Robin.  None of us had ever been there.  It was me, my boyfriend and our 8-year-old daughter.  

Boy were we surprised!  Not only is it a very family-friendly atmosphere, but it's just a fun place in general (no matter your age).  We enjoyed the tablet at our table (could be used to order drinks, appetizers or desserts, as well as to pay your bill, join their rewards club and to play games), even though we were charged a $2 entertainment fee, because our daughter played games (still, it was great to be able to sit there and talk as adults and enjoy our meal while she was entertained).  

Our food was excellent.  I normally don't like \"pub fries\", which is what I think of when I see the fries they offer, so I was unsure about the bottomless fries, but I ordered a burger (the Black & Bleu) and I upgraded my bottomless fries for 99 cents to the Garlic Parmesan Fries and got the garlic dipping sauce for the fries.  They were amazing and I did get a second helping of them (second batch was double the size of the first).  I ate every last bit of my meal.  It was excellent.

My daughter was thrilled with her choices.  She also has bottomless fries, their corndog bites and a chocolate milk shake.  All-in-all, I will definitely be visiting Red Robin again.  It's a new favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is bad. But where do I start with the reasons this place is bad? The service...the service is horrific. We didn't get our silver ware until 3/4 of the way through dinner. Also the service was slow. We had to ask the waiter to take our appetizer plates away. The food was flavorless. I had 8 fries on my plate when the server brought my burger. My son had a grilled chicken breast from the kids menu. It was covered in soot and tasted like oil. I would think twice before heading back for dinner."}
{"text":"Great burgers, friendly staff, unlimited fries and open late. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great service!  Best turkey burger I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"I was in this location on the 12 th on June.. I got a to go order the bar guy who took it was awesome .. he was friendly and he made sure everything was right and I had everything.. this was a difficult order to boot... and the have me a little snack ( fries) to nibble on for the way home.. the made want to come back often so I will(:"}
{"text":"Have you been there lately? Completely redone-more upscale less kidafied. Gone is the loudness, carnival games, and bright colors. There is now a divider between the bar area and the dining room. The bar is full with new drinks and brews as well as flat screen tv's for sports viewing. 

Still have great burgers, bottomless fries, and a ultra-friendly waitstaff. This a large restaurant with many booth and tables.  So even though it's always crowded you can usually get a table quickly. Be sure to join the Red Robin club-get a free burger after 12 purchases, and a free burger on your B-day."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my husband and son last night.

I want to talk about the service first because it was excellent!  Our server's name is Aric and he was pleasant and attentive from start to finish.  He answered my questions, was patient when I switched my order and made sure our bottomless drinks and sides were refilled quickly.  I could not have asked for better service!

As for the good food - my son had a pepperoni pizza which looked like it was freshly basked, almost artisan like.  My son had broccoli for a side and since it was bottomless (and he must have really liked the broccoli) he asked for two more orders of it.  Can't complain with a kid liking his veggies!  My husband had the Siracha Burger I believe and said that it was good.  He remarked about how good the onions were.  I had a Smoky BBQ burger which was not too sweet and just the right size.  I had sweet potato fries as my side order and it was delicious.  I ended up getting a second order to share with my husband and son.  For my drink, I had the raspberry cream soda, which was also bottomless so I had a second order followed by water.  It was very good.

Pricing wise - there were definitely some pricier burgers but others were reasonable.  With the bottomless drinks and sides, it makes it worth the price!

We went on a Wednesday night so it wasn't too busy and we were seated right away.  I think there was sufficient parking and the interior decor was ok - nothing spectacular but definitely refreshed and fairly modern.  Looks like they have a bar as well.  

Overall, the experience was great - my family and I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location for free the last 8 times I've been there or ordered from them...I think I'm finally done. They can't get an order right to save their lives.

They try, I'll give em that. They've re-fired my order three times to get it right more than once and they've not charges me for to go orders just to get them wrong anyway more than once. Terrible.

If you're looking for a place to eat that doesn't take three hours and three re-fires to get you your food, you're better off staying home and ordering Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Love the new plating and the food has bumped up in presentation and flavor. Plus what kid or fry lover can resist bottomless fries? The healthy options are a plus,  definitely a worthy burger spot."}
{"text":"Today, a good friend and I came to Red Robin for a light meal.  I've always loved their burgers but today we were looking for a salad.

The place was busy! Good thing there was ample space, we got seated right away.  I enjoy the open concept that this place offers.  There's pictures everywhere and the wooden panels show character.  The server on the other hand, was really not impressionable at all.  I even forgot his name and I literally left about 20 minutes ago!

Today I got the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad for $10.19.  As said on their menu, this dish includes ancho-grilled chicken breast, avocado slices and fresh-fried jalapeño chips on top of crisp greens.  I added the salsa-ranch dressing on the side. This salad is finished with diced red and green bell peppers and onions, black beans, roasted corn, cheddar cheese and crunchy tortilla strips.  This salad was good!

The chicken was flavorful and juicy.  I greens and tortilla strips really offered some great texture.  I also enjoyed the fried jalapeño chips.  It was the right kind of bad that I needed LOL.  Everything together really made the dish a southwestern masterpiece!

I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Was hoping to stop in for lunch on Friday--there was a short ten minute wait. Restaurant & bar area were mostly empty but waiting room was busy... so my dad went to wait by the bar area until our table was called--hostess and waitress rudely told me I needed to go tell my dad he couldn't wait in the empty bar area until our table was ready. I clearly explained he just wanted to sit and wait and the waitress became even more rude. It is still unclear why my dad couldn't sit down in bar area and wait... especially when no waiting room seats were open (we didn't expect to be served yet). Disappointing experience, we left."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service.whens the last time you treated your self to something nice."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch here due to proximity to our hotel.  The food took 40 minutes, terrible service, good was just ok.  If you have lots of time, it might be enjoyable but otherwise, make another choice.  

Burger was good, fries just ok.  Avocado blt wrap was pretty good, served with fruit salad, just ok.

It's pretty much what you'd expect from a chain restaurant, slow service, ok food, high prices.  Kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"It's Red Robin. This just okay in terms of food, I don't end up here too often. 

Normally if I am here, I go for some onion rings, milkshakes or some fish and chips, sometimes a chicken sandwich. Is it weird I don't get burgers at a place with burger in the name? 

This last visit was just for a little bit of dessert, a salted caramel milshake which was pretty decent and I should have gotten a extra tin. 

Our server was pretty nice. Checked on us often. 

I don't come here often, but the milkshake was good enough that maybe I should."}
{"text":"Great hamburger restaurant that we go to often and have for years. Seem to be hitting it for lunch more and more recently as I am a fan of their cole slaw and endless fries. Great when the grandkids come too! Wife enjoys the good burgers and my choice is the grilled chicken breast.
One of the better chains in several states so dependable and high quality service as well."}
{"text":"On our way to the airport, we stopped in for lunch. 
Started with the pretzel bites with beer cheese. Ok but there was some sort of oil on the pretzels that didn't need to be there. 
Ordered the clucks and fries and cod sandwich. I know, odd order for a burger place but we weren't up for 1/2 pound of red meat plus toppings. 
Cod was good but heavy on breaking. Tenders were decent but not great. Good but nothing to rave about except the good service."}
{"text":"I usually love eating at Red Robin..but tonight we ordered take out! I'm disappointed to say the least..For having bottomless fries for dine in, you'd think you'd get more than 8 fries for take out! I might as well have ordered the kid burger..it came with the same amount as mine..So in conclusion, dine in, not worth the $ for take out!"}
{"text":"Shout out to Victor our amazing waiter!!
This was a great place to grab a quick dinner. Service was quick. Absolutely delicious juicy burgers with bottomless fries.
We will be back on our next shopping trip!"}
{"text":"Rob is awesome! He's very enthusiastic and out there but he was pleasant and cared about his table.
  
I am a waitress myself so I know if I ever matched him it would've taken a lot of energy from me.

I don't expect much from a burger chain but he made the experience memorable."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times. Food & Service were always decent the times I have visited this location. The thing Red Robin is known for is serving bottomless fries with their burgers. Of note, you can substitute the bottomless fries for other items for free and certain items for a small extra charge ranging from broccoli to sweet potato fries. The burger is also customizable such as what type of bun among other things.
Signing up for their loyalty card does win you a free burger in your birthday month every year and other discounts & offers throughout the year.
The most recent visit, my friend & I had a very helpful and attentive waitress named Medina I believe? If every visit yields good results I will keep coming back when the urge to eat a whole lotta fries hits."}
{"text":"The bar tender is a bitch. They have a smooth yin the menu that I ordered but they don't even know how to do the mix."}
{"text":"Called in to ask for wait time,  it was 25 mins, I was able to put my name in. When we walked in,  we were seated within 2 mins of walking in. Ordered the red rob royal,  delicious! They had happy hour too,  so that was a plus. Love the bottomless french fries. Service was great and even though we came at the busiest time,  or food came quick."}
{"text":"Ordered for take out.  $85.00 spent dinner and desserts.  Order received came with very little fries even though we paid extra for sweet potatoes.  Desserts were micro in size, like maybe the staff filling the order at the other half.  Very disappointed with how they handle a take out order when we have had nothing but above average when eating at the location and spent less money.  Observed staff standing around laughing, while customers waited over 20 minutes.  Co workers seem to be not operating as a team.  Where was the manager....very sad and like I said been going to red robin since I was young, this location and order out very disappointing since we traveled over 20 miles to get there to pick up food."}
{"text":"Bad service.  The funny thing is, they had me fill out two surveys since then, and I reported the issues in detail, but nobody took the initiative to contact me back.  It is as if corporate has some great idea, \"Hey, let's implement surveys!\" but lacks the connectivity to actually do something when a problem is brought to their attention through the survey.   What's the use?  Not only has Red Robbin taken my money over crappy service, now they have taken my time too, to no avail. My take is that a few guys in suits want to show their investors that they care, force surveys into the company-wide protocol, but the rest of the Red Robbin team lacks the capacity to act upon the results, to even try to improve, or even care.   There are plenty of other good restaurants in the area.  Let this one go out of business so we can replace it with people that care, IMHO...   IT'S ABOUT SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"This is another spot for lunch during the week.  I've been here a couple of times and the service has always been good.  We have always been seated right away and drinks are always refilled in a timely manner.  Our last visit was later in the afternoon around 1:30pm.  There were just a few others there so our server was very attentive.  I love the burgers here. You can get a burger any way you want with almost anything on it..  The bottomless fries are great too!  They are big steak fries.  Try a side of Campfire sauce with them!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Great Mai Tais and Fish and Chips. We get the fish and chips and yam fries and a burger of the day with fries and a sauce medley. The place is clean and the service is very good. Always. We love it here after a hike in the mountains on the way home. If I could get a salad I would, I swear ; )"}
{"text":"I love Red Robin, but DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION! I came twice and each time, different servers, I get horrible customer service. It so happens that I was in the area of this location. The two times I visited, there wasn't a server for the different areas I was sat in. On my most recent visit, I was asked on three different occasions that this person would be my server and what my drink would be. Finally I ordered with one server and he didn't even come by my table to ask if the food came out to my expectations after it was served. The food was mediocre. I check my bill and the server added the extra salsa I asked for at $2 each. I have never had to pay for any extras. I waited for about 10 minutes from pressing the call server button for him to come and check on us. The manager came by and she wants to give the excuse that all locations should be charging and all that. As a manager, you should take the extra charges off and apologize. Please I beg, do not come to this location. Visit the Summerlin location. I never have a problem there."}
{"text":"I've always loved Red Robin. So I was very surprised when I saw that the location we went to only got three stars. Well we went and now I understand why it got three stars. The food was consistently good, however the wait staff needed some work. They lost our drinks, who does that? Then once we finally placed our order the burgers were hot the fries were cold. The kiosk that they want you to use to check out with didn't work apparently on several of the tables, so we had to wait for our waitress to find the time to come back to us. It wasn't really that busy it was a Thursday night. All in all, food good service not so much. If you go there don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Don't fill up on the bottomless frys before your meal arrives.
I think this was my deciding visit!  I'm not sure if I will be back, it was ok!  Nothing really exciting to write about.  Just the fact that it was a decent place to sit down and have a burger or a few other choices. 
I got the guacamole bacon burger, I had to keep shaking there special seasoning on my burger.   I also had to do a double take, to make sure the guacamole was really on tt.  
My root beer float...I'm not sure about there ice cream, it wasn't that sweet.  
I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit to this location, 3rd total at Red Robin. We aren't usually fans of chain restaurants but this place is pretty great. Great service each visit. Waitress accommodated my special order and it was perfect, I'm on a special diet and I got steamed broccoli and plain chicken. Very happy I could eat out almost as healthy as home. They obviously have many more things on the menu that are much more indulgent, but I'm super happy with what I'm able to get!"}
{"text":"I have never had worse service at a restaurant before. We had a party of 7 and it took 10 minutes for our server to come and even take our drink orders. And another 15 minutes to get our drinks. The place wasn't super busy and we were seated near the kitchen and whenever I looked our server was standing by the food pick up just waiting looking around. He didn't once check in on us to see how everything was, when we needed something we had to flag him down. My chicken sandwich was slightly undercooked, and I had to tell him I wasn't going to pay for something that I didn't even get to enjoy. The only good thing I can say is the onion rings are amazing. I'm glad a person I was with shared his appetizer with me or else I would have gone hungry. We had empty water cups for the majority of our meal, he didn't once come with any refills on the waters. Which is something super easy and noticeable for a server. Probably will never be back to a Red Robin again. Can't ever get good service. Maybe the managers should put an emphasis on customer service and their servers will probably make more money in tips. The awful customer service makes the entire dining experience a lot less enjoyable."}
{"text":"We stopped in for burgers and beer yesterday. Since we wanted a beer, we requested bar seating. When our beers and food came out, our glasses were incredibly dirty. My burger was cold and raw (asked well). My wife didn't touch hers. Worse, though, was the hostess seating two elderly folks RIGHT beside of us at the bar. As soon they sat, they started complaining that I was having a beer! His wife was raising hell at him for letting them be sit at the bar, and when the waitress came by they demanded a table somewhere else. Why would a hostess set an elderly couple at the bar when maybe 1/4 of the restaurant was being used, other than to cause problems? I have no interest in supporting a business that likes to troll it's own customers. My wife likes the brand, though, so we'll just make sure we visit our location in Queen Creek."}
{"text":"The Happy Valley Road location customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  I placed a to-go order and against my better judgement selected the HVR location.  I had been going to a location further away, but didn't feel like driving the extra distance.  I placed my order and selected curbside pickup, since it aways such a hassle to go in and find someone to actually get the order.  I arrive at the time the order was supposed to be ready and call the number on the sign.  Unsurprisingly, the phone rings, and rings, and rings...finally after a good 2 minutes someone answers and I explain I am at the curbside pickup and was told one of the staff would bring it right out.  So, I wait, and wait, and wait...and after 15 minutes go in to find no one at the reception.  Flag down the manager who goes and gets the order.  No apology, no explanation..here's you food and have a nice day.  No fries to go like other locations do.  I really don't think anyone at that store even care if people eat at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I have to agree with many of the reviews for Red Robin. Decent food, service slow. We sat at the bar and listened to the phone ring the entire time. Is that the best place for it? They obviously need more staff. There are too many tables for two and about twenty-five people waiting in the lobby for bigger tables. We only went b/c we had a gift card. I had the chophouse prime burger and it was cooked to the temp I ordered. Nothing fancy but still well done. Just hire some more staff already."}
{"text":"If you're hungover or just feel like throwing health out the window, Red Robin is a great place to do it at.  This restaurant has all the greasy fried snacks you could dream of, and more! 

Plus, they have huge burgers and fries- and even the option to get a veggie burger.  It's pretty good by the way.

They also have quite a few desserts on the menu, including a really delicious oreo shake.  YUM!

The food is good, but nothing is outstanding.  Our server seemed more interested in discussing her failed date the night before with another serve than serving us.  But then again, we did get to hear all the embarassing and shameful details of her one night stand, so it made our meal much more entertaining."}
{"text":"We've done family b-day dinners here for the past 5 years.  We come for the singing, the mud pie and the freckled lemonade.  Service is hit and miss."}
{"text":"Great take on a burger joint with lots of options,  including a couple of vegan burgers. Bottomless fries are a plus, bit the original serving is ridiculously small, as are.the refills.  That being said,  I like that you can order a burger lo-carb,  and the salad options are plentiful. a good place for a burger & beer with friends,  or to take the family"}
{"text":"I gave Red Robin a score of 5 stars in part because of our server, Tamika.  The food is always good (3.5) but the highlight of the meal was having Tamika as our server.  We were in around 8:30pm and the restaurant was slammed.  Tamika was running her butt off and it would be so easy for a server to be out of sorts or cranky.  She was so professional yet friendly and we never wanted for anything.  She served all her tables, cleaned tables up and checked on us several times just to make sure our meal was perfect.  If Red Robin management reads these reviews, please feel free to contact me...it's rare to get such great service and I would love to see Tamika get the recognition she deserves."}
{"text":"Yeah a solid burger and fries joint - some tasty looking milkshake options too if you happen to want to bump your meal up another thousand calories. Got a slightly tweaked bacon guacamole burger with the bottomless fries (awesome!) and would go again to try another variation (and sweet pot fries this time..)"}
{"text":"Waited 15 min to be seated and there were plenty of open tables. Must have been understaffed. After seated it was 10 min before someone even stopped at our table. My Wedgie burger didn't have guacamole on it as described or pictured on menu. Husband asked for more fries and they were delivered after he'd finished eating. Not a grand dining experience."}
{"text":"Red Robin likes to portray itself as a casual dining family restaurant, but don't be fooled- the food is just as bad for you as any \"Super Size Me\" fast food joint. Disappointingly, there are virtually no healthy meal options at Red Robin, unlike many of its competitors.

Burgers and salads all run around 1000+ Calories by default, NOT COUNTING the \"bottomless fries\" that are included with many meals. You can mitigate the damage, though. Be prepared to ask for no mayo or sauce if you order a burger, and be prepared to ask for the dressing on the side if you order a salad."}
{"text":"We try to avoid chain establishments but thought we'd give this a try. 

Could be that the food servers are just asked to handle over-sized stations, but our server forgot several items or had to be asked repeatedly.  Not unfriendly, but service was certainly not enthusiastic.

2 of us ordered burgers, and when the baskets came we both asked for an immediate refill on the bottomless fries because the manager must have been portioning out the fries because it was about 50% of a reasonable portion. The few fries that came out with the meal were polished off in 3 minutes, but no worries, \"bottomless\" fries were on the way.  20-25 minutes later, the additional fries arrived, and still a smallish portion. This is an easy item and one they feature on all their ads --- how could it possibly take so long? We had long since finished our burgers. It seemed to my friends and I that this delay was possibly intended and part of the \"glass ceiling\" to control the number of french fry refills.  The burger was good, but cried out for more fries.

Prices are reasonable, but the slower service and lack of response to specific requests makes a return trip unlikely.  Lesson learned ... still with the local, non-chain operators when possible!"}
{"text":"Daugther recommended Red Robin just as a new place to try.  But when I got the bill for 6 adults and 4 children I got \"sticker\" shock.  The price was outrageous just for a burger (which were small-had to get my grandson a second one) fries and a drink.  We would of been better off at Steiner's were on Wednesday,s they have burgers with fries for $6.00 a person and other specials on different nights.  Carl,s $6.00 burgers are even bigger and better.  Save some money and go someplace else unless you like paying high prices for mediocre burgers."}
{"text":"It is with a heavy heart that I need to give this rrgb a poor review... From entering the restaurant at 515 when it was 3/4ths empty: 4 employees sitting around at the hostess station, i was the only group needing seated, yet we wait there circa 5 minutes because \"everyone is on break and noone can clean the table.\" Hmm, is this a union factory and only a busser can clean up? Get off your fat fn as&s and get a table fn ready. Omfg.  Number of F's given between these 4 fantastic employees: Zero.

Ordering... Took a while to get our order, 35 min, despite half empty store.  Asked server to bring an extra fries with dinner, but of course these came out two minutes later.....cold. Nice.  At least the burgers were good and cooked properly..medium was actually medium.  And of course, the fries that came with dinner were also cold.

Helpful reminder to red robin mgt: essentially you need to do three things well: get me seated, make a good burger, and provide hot french fries.  Fail on 2 of 3 of the above. I expect a lot more for a 13.49 burger, especially with melt next door.  Not sure I would be back to this location. They obviously hit rock bottom on their hiring practices and also rock bottom on their level of giving a $&&$.

And these are the kinds of people \"striking\" because they need 15.00 per hour. Wtf ever. 1.50 is too much."}
{"text":"It's not that I don't like burgers. I just need to be in the mood for a burger. Last night when I went to Red Robin I wasn't. Why the hell did you go to Red Robin you say? I had a left-over gift card to use, ok? 

So I went with a veggie burger prepared like one of their 
\"signature\" burgers. It had melted cheese, bourbon sauce and onion straws. Of course it came with fries. I didn't finish the veggie burger and it didn't sit well with me. Oh well. Good try. 

The service was outstanding and garnered a nice tip by the way. 

So for this visit, 2 stars. I did have a burger here several months ago and it was pretty good. 3 stars for that visit."}
{"text":"iPad like devices at the table are a total scam. What kid can resist playing with it, but there is a catch. As soon as they play a game, $1.99 is added to your bill. Small amount, but I felt ripped off."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Red Robin the other night the food was good but our server Diana K. made the experience great."}
{"text":"I go to this Red Robin often and have never left dissapointed. One of my favorite things is that they seat people without kids in the bar section so you don't have to worry about loud or upset kids. The staff is always very friendly. The food is always good and fast. We've only had to wait once and it was for about 10 minutes. I have noticed that larger families have to wait quite a bit longer."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Came here for my wife's free birthday burger and to try their version of the ramen burger, the Red Ramen.

It's fine.  The ramen bun is too hard and crunchy.  It's not chewy and cooked through like other ramen burger buns.  Makes it really tough to eat since you can't press it down and it cuts the roof of your mouth.  The balance of ingredients in it was mediocre, in relation to the meat.  With how bland the bun was and how much of the thing was actually ramen bun, they could have beefed up the flavors in the burger itself.

Also had the prime chophouse burger which has cheese, steak sauce, and fried onions in it.  This was a pretty tasty burger.  Much better balanced than the ramen burger here.

I get it.  Red Robin can't compare to the best in the country, but like Yelp says for 3-star joints, it's A-OK.  Bottomless steak fries.  Lots of dipping sauces (like the bacon aioli, addictive but bad for you I'm sure.)  Decent burger that they will leave a little pink.  You come for value and time to hang out, not because it's the best burger out there."}
{"text":"After terrible service and no food at T.G.I.Fridays.
We came over to Red Robin and got amazing service. Our server Myana was great. She got our food and drinks to us with good time.  The food was Delicious and filling.  Thank you Red Robbin for serving my family a wonderful meal. We will deffinentely come back."}
{"text":"Had to come get my free birthday burger with my family. I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger. It was a nice size and the fries were good as usual.and we had good prompt service even though they were really busy that day."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night service was great we enjoyed the burgers here they were perfectly prepared and the buns were not burnt like at \"Chip off the block deli.\" I also enjoy the bottomless fries at Red Robin."}
{"text":"First - Love Red Robin. Ordered to go and meal was ready, accurate and easy to get in and out. Could use a \"pick up to go at bar\" sign or something like that.

Meal was ready - asked for an add on when I picked up and the server quickly grabbed the extra side plus one of the campfire/fry sauces (which is a MUST have if you get fries). Good was well prepared and good packaging kept it \"fresh\" or \"hot and ready\" when I got back to the Hampton.

Good location and easy to get to and from if you're staying at a hotel in the area."}
{"text":"My Partner In Cuisine and I do our best to avoid corporate food, but him being a burger expert (i.e. snob) I convinced him to give the place a go.  I had been there on numerous occasions and enjoyed their variety of burgers and unlimited steak fries.  Unfortunately, I suffered a rather embarrassing moment when we were told that the kitchen will not cook a burger rare.  I know better than to ever suggest a corporate restaurant to the PIC again!  

Despite this, we had some decent service and our burgers were pretty good.  After much discussion, we determined that it's not really the burgers that makes Red Robin good, it's the toppings.  Simply said, the meat can't stand alone.  Without being slathered in cheese, jalapenos, barbecue sauce, or whatever, the burgers are nothing more than overcooked hockey pucks.  

Would I eat there again?  It's likely I would go with someone who has less discriminating taste buds.  Would I take PIC?  Hell no!"}
{"text":"CON:  We were shocked by the cold greeting we received from Courtney at the front door; we asked if there was room in the bar area & without making eye contact (and with her head down) she said, \"I don't know, you can check for yourself.\"  We were stunned by her response that we just stood still for a moment, then proceeded to enter into the bar.  PROs:  in the bar we were greeted by Mikela & she provided outstanding service throughout our stay.  Further, our meals were very tasty; I loved the Ensenada chicken (sauce on the side).  Because of the awful greeting at the door I am giving this place only 3 stars; first impressions are lasting impressions!"}
{"text":"If I could select a lower star rating i would. The wait was 30 minutes. Another 30 just to get our food. Then we get it and its cold! Our waitress was no where to be found, i ask for the manager and that was another 15 minutes. Worst service and experience ever."}
{"text":"This is the worst Red Robin. We have given it 3 treys. Hoping that each time was a bad day. But looks like every day is a bad day. Eac time we ordered a burger we were missing some of the ingredients. The Ghost buger had 2 fried jalapeno chips and no lettuce, no Tomatoe. Next visit Bacon Cheese burger missing Bacon. Thought she miss heard and did a cheese burger..nope got charged for a bacon cheese burger. Last and I mean very last visit. Ghost burger had no fried jalapenos and service was iffy at best. I will now give the one on Elliot a try. Dont waste your money here"}
{"text":"It started of ok. The waitress explained a device in the table that could be used to order our meals, call for help and pay without the waitresses help. She made comments that she personally doesn't like it because it limited her services. So we told her that we prefer not to use the device to help her out. Then it went down hill. The beer my husband wanted they ran out. He asked her what she would recommend and she didn't have too much suggestions so my husband end up having water. Then our food arrived. There was no utensils and waited for our waitress but she was no where in site so we used the device. On top of the device it was blinking red so the staff could see we needed help. We counted 10 staff members passing by looking directly at the device and did not check to see if we needed help. Our fries was cold and stale and we got our food. My husband had the Bleu Ribbon and it had a weird after taste to it. We thought it would have been the Bleu cheese. I had the BBQ whisky chicken burgers. They overloaded it with regular onions instead of string onion rings. Don't plan on going here anymore."}
{"text":"RR is always a favorite for burgers! We tried a few of their new menu items- the oktoberfest berger and the salsa ranch & chips and really enjoyed both. The staff here is always upbeat and attentive."}
{"text":"Tried RedRobin for the first time, ordered a fancy chicken sandwich, unfortunately it was partially cooked. The meet was tough. When they asked about my meal, I shared the concern- it fell onto deaf ears. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Not a fan of most restaurant chains and this place proved why. 

The food was not good. The burgers are very mediocre. They were not cooked how they were asked to be cooked (4 of us asked for medium and they were all well done). The sauces were your basic sauces like it's out of a container. Nothing seems fresh. It's like eating at a place that's one notch over fast food. But even then, I've had some fast food burgers that are way better. 

The steak fries are like big soggy potatoes. 

The service was horrible. It was not busy and we kept having to ask other waiters to get our waiter so we could order. He also screwed up our checks and ran the wrong cards on the wrong tickets. We even had him correct it when he passed them out wrong. We had separate dividers and he still ran them wrong. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Expectation versus Reality

4 people, 4 different pictured menu items = 3 disappointed customers. The One satisfied dish during this dinner is the reason for one of the stars. I had the Avo-Cab-O salad. Expectation is a Cobb salad with a generous amount of avocado since it's in the name. Pictured - a beautiful fluffy salad with a decent amount of avocado. Reality - 4 chunks of avocado, 10 diced tomatoes, 4 small slices of chicken, a pile of fatty bacon chopped, a whole plate of lettuce and no egg. I actually had to ask the server for the egg that was supposed to be served with it. The Brie Burger was pictured with generous amount of brie with crispy bacon and all the trimmings, Reality - dry, lack of flavor, little Brie. Totally not worth the $14. The bbq chicken sandwich was pictured with crispy chicken on a bun dripping of bbq sauce with ranch. Reality - dry chicken tenders with such a minuscule amount of BBQ sauce that we had to order more BBQ sauce just to compensate. Totally not worth the $7. The dish that saved the one star is the chicken bruchetta sandwich. That one came out looking and tasting great! One star saved!! 


The next star that was saved was our server Justin! He provided us excellent service that despite our experience with our meal, he still made our visit pleasant! He saved one extra star!"}
{"text":"Still sucks!!!! Corporate needs to step in and make some changes and retrain the staff."}
{"text":"Really we ask twice for fresh fries and when they did come out it was obviously from the bottom of the basket. When I ask for the 10 raggedy fries to be replace she gave me a look and said it will be 5 minutes in a snotty way. I hate this place! I got the Banzai burger and didn't realize it would be drenched in teriyaki sauce that would make the bun so soggy it was gross."}
{"text":"Not happy as soon a we sat down I told the waitress it was my baby's birthday she said OK we will bring him a sundae. She charged us and we were still there waiting to see when they were going to come out and sing happy birthday and it never happened was going to say something but my babay started to get fuzzy I just told my kids let's go. It was point less to go eat at Red Robin for my baby birthday. I should of just on to olive Garden"}
{"text":"Zero stars if possible.

Do you like to be ignored?  Do you enjoy walking up to wait staff, to ask for service, then ignored after that?
Then this Red Robin is your place!!   
Seriously, all that was going on, was a birthday party in the back.  Nothing else.

My husband and son, were \"greeted\" (??) by an absolutely clueless hostess.  Sat them in a dark bar area, even though there were tables and booths available. She never asked them where they'd prefer to sit. Then like I stated already, they were ignored, and ignored, then ignored some more. Can't be that much more ignored. Even after asking for service. Good job, Red Robin!! *sarcasm*

They took their business to Chick-Fil-A.  Clean establishment, with very friendly staff, that actually waited on them, taking their order, and serving them,  What a great concept!!  :)

(*adding on.  You can see that whoever owns this business, really doesn't care!)."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend showed up, seated, and took our drink order. 

Asked to start out with fries with our drinks. We ordered two Arnold Palmers (non-alcoholic).

She returned with the drinks and said \"waiting on the fries to come out..\" perfectly understandable it was a Sunday afternoon so a little busy.

Took our order, we both ordered the boca patties since we don't eat meat.

15 min later she returns still with no fries, and says \"I have bad news guys.. we are out of I can patties..\" 

Ok so at the point it is what it is but then they charged us for the drinks.. $7 for two Arnold palmers with no refills after waiting 20 min to be told we won't be getting our order. That's pretty annoying and I won't be returning after that. That's unacceptable."}
{"text":"Our waiter was very nice and attentive. We went later in the evening when it was decently packed. We received our food quickly, and everything tasted awesome. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I'm rating this for cleanness from today's visit and last visit. Bathroom where dirty last time I came today the table where you seat at where dirty. But the food was great. And drinks. We sat at the sports bar section. This is are 3rd time coming here."}
{"text":"Unlimited fries is a phrase that should make you start asking questions.

Typically when a restaurant offers any food item as \"never ending\" you should probably use better judgement and steer clear of it.  Welp, I didn't, thus I failed.  Red Robin is a chain place that claims to have amazing burgers and infinite fries.  The fries are almost soggy steak fries that don't pair well with the burgers.  They tasted as if they've been sitting under a warming lamp and I didn't ask for a fill up.  The burgers were okay, but neither of ours were cooked the way we wanted.  I asked for Medium it was medium well.  My wife asked for well and it was medium well.  I bet the cook just cooks everything to medium well.  Good for him.....

I really don't know what else to say.  Might be a nice gimmicky place if you have kids, but really not worth it at all."}
{"text":"No offers after I checked in. Only negative thing I can say.  Love the fries and turkey burger! Our waiter Curtis was on it too!"}
{"text":"2 teenagers and myself on a Thursday night. My daugher loves this place. Me, I haven't been to a RR in years. 

We walk in and are seated right away. Waitress arrives within about 5 minutes. By this time I had a chance to look over the menu so we order drinks and food. Valerie? brings the drinks quickly and as she is setting them on the table she makes a comment that she forgot straws. She comes right back with straws and lays them on the table. Normally this would not be a problem BUT, the straws were not wrapped. Uhhh, nasty! 
Strike 1

Daughter tells me that they bring every table a basket of fries, so I'm excited about that. The table next to us is on thier second basket and have not been served entrees yet. 2 women are seated at the table behind us and we watch our waitress bring them a basket and she tells them \"here's some fries to munch on while you wait\". Hmmm....she never mentioned it to us or bring US fries. WTF?
Stike 2

Order arrives quickly. Me: bacon burger with bleu cheese. Daughter: salad with chicken strips. Son: chicken strips and fries. My burger is pretty good. Son and daughter love what they got....they're happy. My son grabs the ketchup...squirt, fart, spray. Empty. We wait for someone for a few minutes but alas, no one is around. So I get up on a quest to find some ketchup. Next table over? empty. Table next to that? empty. Finally on the 3rd try I pick a winner and can now start to enjoy my burger. Now, I've worked as a waiter and I know it is bad juju to leave empty condiments on the table. Her table, her responsibility. Yeah, shit happens and I could understand if the placed was slammed but it wasn't.
Strike3

So, the food was good...burger was nothng special but it was good. I still don't know why we weren't given fries. I might be back but I doubt it unless somehow my daughter can convince me to try again. IMO there are too many restaraunt choices out there to settle for lame service."}
{"text":"For a chain, Red Robin does burgers well.  Prime Chophouse burger.  Service is quick.  A bit loud inside.  $10 burger is worth the visit."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was absolutely abysmal.

Monday night (Presidents Day), around 8 pm. Nobody at the host stand, so we seated ourselves in the bar area. 

The bartender (long blonde hair) ignored us for a solid 10 minutes. We were about to get up and go across the street to Buffalo Wild Wings when she finally acknowledged us with \"I'll be right there\"... Then kept cleaning her bar and talking to other servers about cashing them out. 

(Hey management, I sincerely hope she is not a trainer or key, because she is a very bad example). 

5 minutes later, she finally walks up with an acute case of Resting You-Know-What Face and asks what we want to drink. We still don't have menus at this point. When she comes back with drinks, she then asks if we want menus.
... Nah, I wanted to sit and drink water and tip a sour-faced bartender for the privilege. Come on. 

Everything was insanely slow the rest of the time. We were the only table by the time our food came out & a refill of fries took 15 minutes. When we went to pay, the Ziosk brought up the wrong check & we had to get her to print one... She was sure on THAT quickly...

We may do Red Robin again but definitely not this location."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  This place is a wonderful example of American cuisine gone wrong.  When a restaurant relies on salt and mayonnaise as the staple flavor profile, the food is well, boring (i.e. Chipotle Mayo).

Red Robin is a burgers and fries type place, fried everything.  Fried everything should be DELICIOUS!  What is missing?

The presentation of all the dishes is fine, it is the utter lack of flavor that was so disappointing.  Had a burger and onion rings, and while there was nothing particularly wrong with it, it was completely forgettable.

The atmosphere is very corporate.

The service is designed to be good, but falls flat, again too corporate (waiter virtually up your ass when you don't need him, and not around when you do).

In summary, there are way better places to spend your time, money and calories.  We gave it a shot, and it wasn't our cup of tea.  If you like it, more power to you.  

I usually do not review restaurants until I have given them several chances and tried different items, but I won't be returning.  I just can't bring myself to eat here.  The food is edible, but while I was eating, I actually wondered to myself why I was eating it."}
{"text":"I was unaware that the bar seating wasn't open seating. So first heads up is the bar top is the only open seating. Had the hostess greeted us upon entering we would have known that. (Minus 1/2 star) 

We had a decent 5-7 minutes because the waiter came over, again the hostess didn't seat us so I suppose he didn't know. (Minus 1/2 star) 

Always a winner is the O-Ring tower. 

I ordered the Red Robin Royal which had a egg on it. Sounds weird and gross but definitely glad I stepped out of my comfort zone because it was delicious. The egg really compliments the burger! 

I got a nana nana moo moo shake. Milk chocolate and banana purée and it was amazing. I will def be back!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst food I ever had. I've never been to a red Robbin before so I don't know what ones expecting but already my stomach hurts and I feel like I just wasted money. This is nothing against this particular location I think I wouldn't like their food regardless of who serves it."}
{"text":"I went with a large group after a Badger came a couple of weeks ago (they put your name on the list when you call ahead--very convenient).  They were accommodating and the service was attentive and the food solid as usual.  It is all so rich that I always feel like I over-eat but they certainly live up to their name for burgers.  Lots of choices for the burgers and lots of yummy non and alcoholic drinks to go with the meal.   They also have screens up around the bar area so those in my party  who wanted to keep up to date on other games that evening could check in while we ate.  When it is busy the atmosphere is loud and so it really isn't someplace I'm inclined to go usually but with a group it fits for a large group who have diverse tastes (if they all like American that is!)."}
{"text":"Eh, it's a chain restaurant like all the rest. Red Robin is kind of like the bastard stepchild of TGI Friday's and Applebee's. As it sits along a stretch of road here populated by almost every chain restaurant known to man it is kind of unassuming and almost invisible. Still, after dropping in here the other day for a quick dinner it is definitely worth a second look.

Yeah, it has all the standard retro pictures, movie/sports posters, and goofy memorabilia hanging on the walls that is the basis of their cheeseball decor. Also has the over cheery waitstaff that you really want to strangle and just wish they would shut up and take your order. The menu has a lot of burger choices along with many other entrees and appetizers to choose from. One thing I noticed right away - 

Bottomless fries and root beer floats. Yes, BOTTOMLESS! OMG - that is totally evil. Must. Resist. Must. 

Not in a burger mood tonight as I was craving some chicken. Went with the Ensenada Chicken Platter. Two boneless chicken breasts rubbed with a chili seasoning and served with a side of salsa and two dipping sauces -  salsa & creamy lime sauce. Also comes with a salad with tortilla strips in it. Honestly, this was pretty tasty. The chicken was cooked just right and the chili rub tasted good, the salad was fresh, and the sauces were decent. 

Not a bad spot to have a meal as far as chain restaurants go. Attentive wait staff, clean space, and decent tasting food. It's OK by me!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Red Robin.  It was one of the first places I could switch the regular burger patty with a decent veggie burger!  I'm not a fan of Boca burgers but they do have a Gardenburger which was pretty good.  I also ordered my personal favorite, towering onion rings as well as the garlic and herb fries and the nana-nana moo moo shake which was all delicious!


Overall a nice experience, clean atmosphere, and the staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I started writing this review by discussing what I read in \"Fast Food Nation\" about those hard chunks that lock in your teeth when you're eating a low-class burger. It was gross. If you've read the book, you remember the chapter. 

Anyway, my Red Robin burger had two of those rock-hard chunks of hoof or cartilage or whatever it is and that ruined the whole experience. It means they cut costs on the beef and that's too bad because it's a really nice place. Good cold beer at fair prices, excellent fries, friendly servers, and a burger that looked like it might be great.

If you're not obsessed with burgers like me you might love the place and a great-looking chicken sandwich or giant salad."}
{"text":"Great service from Ron. Red Robin is our stand by food spot. This trip was better than most. The food is always good, but the service this trip put it over the top.  The burger is not the cheapest but compare the end product to other burger joints and it worth it."}
{"text":"I was recommended to come here for my son's birthday Free burger and was told can have bottom less frys. First of all the waitress was so nice and helpful since she new it was our first time. We got our burgers and of course the frys about three times,lol. We loved it and came back again and was very satisfied. I even tried one of their drinks had run sorry forgot the name but it was just good. Do recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with family and friends. Overall not too bad a place at all. It's busy and the staff is usually running around a good bit to keep up, but they do seem to keep up. The food is good, albeit a bit formulaic. The restaurant itself is clean. My son really favors the grilled chicken on a stick. I like trying one of their burgers, cause they are decent and there are plenty of choices. Good place for the family, good place with friends. Good value for the money."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Who charges so much extra to get 10 sweet potato fries instead of regular fries? Overpriced for what you're given and I won't be back due to that."}
{"text":"I love the food at Red Robin but their customer service sucks. When you walk in no greeting they pretty much stare at you until you speak up to them. If your looking for quality customer service this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"One word about this location... AWFUL. Went on Saturday 12/9 and only waited for about five minutes to be sat for a party of six (3 adults and 3 infants). It was not very busy at all. Our server (Gary with the beard) didn't greet us until 20 minutes after being sat. That 5 table section must have been way too much for him. 30 minutes, yes I said 30 MINUTES go by and we still do not have our drinks and there was not one indication that Gary even knew we existed. All we ordered was soda and one draft beer... ONE. Finally he sees me just staring at him. He then blamed the computer system on why he forgot to go grab a soda LOL. The guy was clearly struggling because we watched him do the exact same thing to two other tables next to us, unbelievable. About an HOUR goes by and we finally get our mozzarella sticks and buffalo wings. Ice cold, mozzarella wasn't even melted lol. Then the burgers of course come 46 seconds after the appetizers and shockingly they are ice cold. I've seriously never had worse service than this place. They need to re-evaluate their staff and have higher standards. Scottsdale Red Robin's never have any service issues and as soon as I move close to this one this is what I get. I won't be back, good thing that a Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers just opened up not too far away."}
{"text":"Red Robin... Yummmmmmm

The Gourmet Burgers are the best chain burger option out there.  These things will kill your waistline, stretch your colon, cause minor heart calcification, and are relatively expensive.  And they are worth it!  Add the tower of onion rings and I think the paper in the basket is a template Last Will and Testament form.

Very family friendly with kid options galore, a diner feel, small arcade, and even free balloons.

Service can be hit or miss with younger wait staff.  Oddly, I've had three waiters-in-training with their mentors in five vists.  Good overall, though.

Carry on my burger brethren..."}
{"text":"Fat, juicy burgers with any topping you can imagine + bottomless steak fries + giant, frosty glasses of your choice beverage + a giant red bird you get to laugh at while he walks around scaring small children while they eat = a happy happy visit to Red Robin.

Red Robin's atmosphere is just all-around friendly and relaxed.  There's kitschy decor all over the place (photos, airplane props, a carousel horse, etc.), and the light fixtures are cool.  It's wide and spacious, and - though this isn't a novel thing anymore - back before the smoking ban, Red Robin was already a smoke-free establishment.  Nice.

Their burgers are amazing, and that's what they're known for, along with their bottomless steak fries, and their signature french fry seasoning, which I have thought of squirreling into my purse on more than one occasion.  (Um, or I could just buy some, since they have it for sale.  I guess I prefer the danger factor of the daydream - ha.)  I usually oder one of their Classic Gourmet Burgers.  My favorite is their Whiskey River BBQ Burger, topped with cheddar cheese, tangy BBQ, and crispy onion straws.  A second fave is the Sauteed 'Shroom Burger, which tastes exactly like it sounds - YUM.  They also have a Knife-and-Forker menu, for burgers so huge they just won't fit in your hands and mouth like regular ones.  Messy, but fun, especially the Burger Parmigiana.

To wash it all down, you can get any run-of-the-mill soda or a great mixed drink (they have a large selection), but I almost always go for their Freckled Lemonade, a YUMMY lemonade with strawberries mixed in.  Unlike other restaurants where you'd have to pay by the glass for a drink like this, Red Robin offers bottomless refills.  

Mmm, strawberries.

And yes, the Red Robin does make an occasional appearance, and I giggle at him every time.  But I wave, because how would I feel, trapped in a bird suit all day?  Somebody's gotta, I guess.  Plus, as a general rule, the more you try to ignore these costumed creatures, the more they come after you.  Seriously,  I think I've seen him twice, and I've been there a lot more than twice, so don't let him deter you."}
{"text":"Very sad. This was my first time to any Red Robin. Started with great service, great food. Then our waitress finished her shift, said someone would be replacing her. She left, we pressed a button for service since no one came by. It timed out twice so I asked the hostess to send someone over. The manager came by, got us more fries and drinks, but no new server. We left when our drinks ran out and we couldn't find a server for dessert.  Makes me sad because the food was good. I'll never know if the dessert was as well."}
{"text":"Went to Red Robin last night with 4 kids and my wife and I.  The food was excellent, waiter was the best I've had in quite some time. Very in tune and addressed the kids age appropriate which was a nice touch.  
Only negative is the prices have gone thru the roof."}
{"text":"I love Red Robin's! This location is in the Tempe Marketplace so there are many shops you can walk to after stuffing your face. I have been to this location once before when my family came to visit me a while back. I was feeling like their French fries after a long day at work, so I decided head over to Tempe. I was promptly greeted by the hostess staff and I told them I'd like to sit at the bar since it was just me. The bartender said hello and handed me a menu. She was friendly, handed me a glass full of ice water, and gave me time to make a decision. I ordered a Margarita and fish & chips. It's one of my favorite entrees here. The fish is always crispy and tastes fresh. The bartenders didn't really make conversation with any of us sitting at the bar, just helped us when we needed something. The service was quick, food was great, overall a decent visit."}
{"text":"Horrible service at the bar. She paid more attention to the well than her guests. Waited 15 mins for a water. Ceasar salad came out with no croutons and I requested mushrooms on my burger that i did not get. I wanted another cocktail but wasnt even asked."}
{"text":"Went with the family for lunch today. They handled our wild two year old child with with smiles and kindness. He even through and broke a glass salt shaker. They cleaned it right up and  we're very understanding about the situation with a child. A status in a great spot so we can look out into the mall so that kept him entertained. I just come from the gym so I had a really good double chicken breast entree that hit the spot.   the kids like usual devour their macaroni and cheese and spaghetti. Their customer service is the best."}
{"text":"Do not order from here if you are needing a quick takeout. They will forget something, they will not properly bag your food, or  they will over charge you and make you wait 2 weeks for a refund. Chances are whatever you ordered isn't even on the online menu anymore, so just avoid this location at all costs. 2x coming here and definitely have a bad taste in my mouth. Don't see myself coming back in the future."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty standard just like Chili's and TGIF. I eat here more than other burger restaurants mainly because of their royalty rewards card. I've already received about 4 free entrees as well as free appetizers and a free birthday burger. Other than that its just another mediocre American food family restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this location. It used to be our go-to, as we have a four year old who loves to come here.

They are currently going through a remodel, and you'd think no one ever worked as a server before.

We've currently been waiting 20 minutes for our drinks. Which include a coke, beer, and chocolate milk. 

The pregnant hostess couldn't have been more rude, after I thanked her twice for seating us. We had 3 waiters stop, look at us, and continue walking before someone asked if we had been helped. That was about 10 minutes before our orders were taken. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't go to Red Robin very often, but for a chain restaurant it's pretty good.

We sat in the bar for lunch. It wasn't too loud, the area was very clean and our server was very kind. We asked to get the bottomless fries ahead of our food so we could have something to munch on.

The fries and our food came out promptly. I got a burger and the hubbs got the fish and chips. My burger was pretty big and I ate all of it... even though I probably shouldn't have because I was stuffed afterwards! The bun got a little soggy towards the end, but that probably attributes more to my slow eating. The fish and chips were much better than I expected them to be... I think I will actually get those next time!

Red Robin! Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"Roman was an amazing server, really nice, and speedy service! Make sure to ask for roman when you come here!"}
{"text":"My buddy wanted to meet for lunch. We were going to eat at another restaurant in this complex. Then he saw a sign that said \"gourmet burgers and brews\", he thought it was a new restaurant and told me to meet him there. It ended up being Red Robin. I have eaten there once or twice before and not been very excited about the food, but we were already here and I wasn't going to complain.
I don't often eat hamburgers with a bun, since I do not eat a lot of bread or pasta or rice and things like that. But I ended up having a A bacon cheeseburger with blue cheese that was absolutely decadent. I even had onion rings. The burger was so filling I only ate half of it. The wait staff was very attentive.  Overall I was very pleased with our lunch. And that's why I gave it four stars"}
{"text":"Food tasted good but they didn't put the right sides with it, also staff is not attentive to their customers it took 20 minutes to get addition meat balls for my son and they didn't bring out his water at all bad service and careless"}
{"text":"average wasnt impressed prob wont go back there was 4 of us and not one of us wants to go back"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars, this place was close...

The place was sparkling clean and fresh smelling...I even went to the Men's room, which is where I fail most places. However, they had auto dispensing towels and the place didn't have pee on the floor so that's a bonus. 
Happy hour all day with $4.50 mixers of Bacardi and Jim Beam which they have multiple flavors of. Wine too but that doesn't really go with a burger. Bottomless Fries of course always helps keep you full. About 10 drafts but a big bottle selection. Lots of TV for sports and such...
Had the classic burger, it was juicy and filling...loving their signature blend spices on my fries. 
The bartender and few servers I saw were actively participating with the patrons and runners bring out the food so it doesn't sit there and get cold or dry out under the heat lamps."}
{"text":"Very pleased with our visit.  Stacy our waitress was outstanding, very great customer service.
Food was very good as well as our service.  Strongly recommend coming during lunchtime not to crowded."}
{"text":"I decided to come here last minute with my friend and we had a really good experience!

We were sat right away and our server helped us real quick and was very friendly.

My friend ordered the madlove burger and i ordered the veggie burger. Me being a carnivore and all, i asked them to sub the veggie patty for a traditional beef patty because, well, I'm not a vegetarian!!

The madlove burger was pretty good. The only thing that threw us off was that the bacon was so dang sweet. It almost took away from the rest of the flavors because it was a little too overwhelming.

The veggie burger, however, was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had! And to top that off with bottomless fries just made for the perfect meal!

We also ordered a couple of shakes and those were kind of ok. I finished my nana nana moo moo but there was a ton of chocolate in both of them. Again, a little overwhelming. Especially in the Oreo one. We expected more of a cookies and cream as opposed to cookies and chocolate with more chocolate shake. But honestly, overall, I'd come back to this location. We just know what not to get next time!"}
{"text":"There are better tasting burgers in the area, but nobody offers as many options as Red Robin. So if you need a change up among the burger joints, this place offers that. 

Like I said, it will not be a great tasting burger, service is a tad slow, and prices are a tad high for the quality. That's Red Robin in a nutshell."}
{"text":"I usually go to Red Robins once a week. But this was my first time going to this location. I usually get a freckled lemonade and the whisky bbq burger, this place was no exception. I would rate the food five stars. The burger comes with bottomless steak fries and the drink is also bottomless... in other words UNLIMITED REFILLS. OMG haha. Usually when you order they immediately bring out the fries first, and by the time the burger comes out I am half way full. Which is quite pleasant because normally only fit half of the burger in my stomach and the next day I eat the other half of the burger. It's like your paying for two mealss for the price of one haha. Anyways this place would've been Five stars if it weren't for the lack of service. I'm not going to lie I drink a lot of water and lemonade even before the meal comes out, but out of the hour I was there I only got my cup refilled once. -_- and after that I waited a good 15-25 minutes for my bill. But overall if you just want some deeeelicious $10 and below hamburgers then this is the place to goo. Make sure you ask for a royalty card too!!! Free burgers on your bday and on your 10th one!"}
{"text":"Only reason for my consideration this time: email from the Red Royalty club for a FREE birthday burger.  I usually avoid RR as they tend to be grossly inconsistent and this location is no exception.

Upon arrival, 20 minutes sitting at table.  Asked twice if I could order.  Server arrives and takes my Chophouse burger order which basically is burger with mushrooms.  Added an order of onion rings also.  The burger only took 15 minutes, which was fine.  The burger itself not so great: the buns were soggy and everything had a mushy texture.  The onion rings helped a bit.  

Trying to call a server to let him know or anyone for that matter was near impossible.  I finally gave up and walked over to the bar, the bartender had the worst look as though she hated her job with a passion.  Not only did she look that way, she displayed one of the worst disgusted looks I have ever seen as I attempted to ask her the question.  After another 12 minutes, I stopped a another waitress who refused to turn around and acknowledge me as I worked hard to explain to her about the birthday burger.  She said under her breath, \"yeah, I got it\" as she stormed on by.  Another 12 minutes flew by with absolutely no action.  My other half went up to the bar again to ask, this time the male manager and bartender both blew a gasket and berated her for asking again.   Finally, a full 30+ minutes later the server stops by claiming a six top occupied all his time.  Not only that, he was not informed to comp my birthday burger so spent yet another 10 minutes to fix.  

Food and Customer Service?  Non-existent with management staff that further perpetuates that culture.  Zero stars - I want my time and money back.   

\"Happy B day, Ken, from RR!\""}
{"text":"So my grandma asked specifically for no thousand island on her burger just mustard on both sides of the the buns. DESTINY our server repeatedly went back and forth about how she checked it and there was no thousand island. She finally took the burger back and the manager came over and didn't introduce herself, she continued to say that she checked it and there wasn't any sauce on it. Basically made it seem like my grandma was crazy because she knew it tasted weird but because everyone stuck their hands in the burger and didn't see no other sauce it was our fault. She offered to make her a new burger but after this kind of experience we chose to pass on it. The service here is terrible. Don't blame the customer for not liking your burgers. Smh will never be returning ."}
{"text":"Today we went to the bar area, self serve seating, there were 3 other tables that had customers, we sat down, and waited maybe 5 minutes to be acknowledged by one of the 5 employees standing at the bar talking amongst themselves, it was around 4pm and not busy at all, a few more minutes went by, nope, not going to get any of those lazy ass employees over to the table they are too busy talking, got up and left the damn place. The only reason it gets two stars is because we have eaten here many times and usually have good service, but today we were the invisible couple."}
{"text":"#1 Zagat rated burger? There's no way! I had the Red Robin Gormet Cheeseburger and thought it was A-OK. I ate 1/2 of the bun and mainly the meat portion since I didn't want to waste the burger. Still can't believe it was $9.78... The burger is pretty average and I don't find anything special about it. Fries are individually bigger, but that does not mean they are tastier. The only thing that is good about the place is their honey mustard sauce. Definitely a place I'd pass on."}
{"text":"I've still gotta lay into the chain-haters over Red Robin, 'cause I can't say that there's a single thing wrong with their burgers! And this was evident yesterday when Kay found herself with a coupon for a free burger for her birthday month. 

The DGB (Damn Great Burger) is one of RR's newest inventions and features oven-roasted tomatoes, a roasted garlic aioli, an on-board mini-salad of fresh arugala dressed in a citrus-infused olive oil and a toasted, flour-dusted ciabatta bun. Tasty and exceedingly tidy thanks to the absorbent and sturdy ciabatta, the DGB's mildly charred and nicely seasoned patty was cooked to a fine mid-rare while the tomatoes brought a sweet smack to counter the tart arugala. I added pepperjack cheese to ramp up the twang a little, but the rich and piquant mayonnaise not only had a say in the matter, it nearly made the burger. I don't know how RR does it, but they do it well. Nothing about the burger tasted processed or flash frozen. 

Look, it ain't BRGR. Red Robin operates at a different level and price point, but for a chain, I can't say RR puts out a crummy burger at all, and hell, they're even creative about them. 

The \"Bottomless\" fries are another matter. While not an abomination in the eyes of Demeter, there is something a little bland about them, but their house seasoning is on every table to remedy that. Let's say I usually don't ask for seconds. 

And wouldn't you know that my very first brush with the doughssaint/cronut craze happened in a suburban Red Robin franchise? RR calls 'em Towering Doh Rings and serve 'em in quantities of 4 or 8, all of 'em rung around a thin metal pole like horseshoes at a family reunion. What to say about them? They live up to their hype and description. What they really remind me of, though, are those sugary doughnut balls that American Chinese joints often sell. Or Indian batura bread? They had the fluffy/crispy texture I expected, and unexpectedly, two dipping sauces: Hot fudge and a sort of raspberry puree (remember that Prince song?) I surprisingly leaned towards the tangy berry juice, savoring each puffy, oily morsel as it was coated in saccharine grit. 

Another odd and even newer dessert RR is offering these days is called Chocolate Fruffles. RR calls them \"soft fudge brownies,\" but they're more like cold, flat candy bars topped with sea salt and sugar crystals. These too come with a berry dipping sauce. Eh, I might have enjoyed them more if I'd been eating them inside the nearby Carmike Theater, but passable they were. 

Hey, they take chances and thus take my dollars. 

Oh, the service wasn't bad either.

P.S. The guac 'n chips we had as a starter would give Mad Mex's version a good match anytime."}
{"text":"So I came here with Kay and her parents and shockingly DID NOT ORDER A BURGER!

Let that cook in your brain for a second. 

No, I tried the Riblets and Clucks, an entree that gets you some all-around spiffy  \"microribs\" (nice sauce and tenderness) and some merely passable breaded chicken strips. The \"endless\" fries were as good as when I had them at the Red Robin near South Hills Village months ago, but does anyone order seconds of these, ever?

The creamy, timidly tangy cole slaw also agreed with me. 

Eh, I should have just gotten a burger. It's great that RR offers a diverse bill of fare, but the Banzai Burger Kay's mom munched on made me envious.

Perhaps it was the flour-dusted bun. Yeah, that always does it. 

Then again, wrapping it in bakery tissue is a cool touch too. 

Damn, I want one now. 

P.S. What is it with chains these days and their fascination with kitschy framed posters? It's as if you're in a teenager's bedroom that doubles as a pop culture museum...and a 50's style restaurant.

P.P.S. We weren't hungry enough for dessert."}
{"text":"We regularly eat at this Red Robin and never had a problem until this visit. The waiter that came over to take our drink order appeared to be rushed. He started to walk away when I was ordering the appetizers. I didn't get a chance to finish. I called a manager over and he apologized and said he would put the rest in.  The waiter just put the drinks on the rable and went to the table behind us. This table were friends of his and more interested in them. He finally returned to take our order. He delivered the appetizers and took our orders. We weren't enen halfway thru with them when he delivered our meals and immediately went back to his table of friends. We wanted drink refills and he asked if we wanted dessert. I told him we jyst got the meals. He said he thought we were in a rush.  We never mentioned anything about being in a hurry. He again return to his friends.  We just wnded up getting togo boxes and paid the bill and left. This was unusual for this restaurant. If we return, I do nit want this waiter. He is more concerned with his friends that waiting on customers."}
{"text":"Waited over ten minutes for server to come to the table after being seated. Restaurant was not that busy at lunch time. None of the orders were correct. Had to keep asking for drink refills. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"worst burger EVER!! for 13 bucks seriously...patty tastes like a pre frozen costco patty...will never go there ever again"}
{"text":"1st time enjoying Red Robin.  Sat in the bar area.  Great service from waitress.  Explain menu and loyalty  program. Yes I signed up!!  Food served nice and hit with quick service"}
{"text":"I happened to be in the mall of all places while on vacation in Vegas.

Decided to pop in and relax while I had a little lunch - seeing how shopping can really drain your energy as well as your wallet.  I know what you're thinking - Red Robin? There's a TON of great places to eat in Vegas - why the hell would you end up there?  Well- I was craving a great burger, and I needed one FAST.

This RR is probably just like all the other RRs you've ever walked into in your entire life.  I was seated in a small table near the window, looking into the busy Galleria mall.  After checking out the menu, I decided on a \"Keep it Simple\" plain burger.   The server apologized for the longish wait and took my order.  It took what I thought was a long time for my food to finally arrive - but I was pleased with both the quality and how large my burger was.  I wasn't in a big hurry, so the wait didn't really bother me.

If you're in the mood for a gourmet burger, check out RR in the Galleria mall.  I'd like to explore the menu and try different burgers the next time I'm there.

3 outta 5 stars from me - worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Seemed as though they were short staffed on service employees. Kitchen made several errors. Food was room temperature. Whoever is in charge here needs to get their act together"}
{"text":"Waitress was awesome n I had the new chopped steak burger it was good n my bf had the royal red Robyn it was also good fries was awesome"}
{"text":"Burgers and fries done right. There's a few times when service is a little slow, but only if they're packed. All other times it's lightning fast and everyone's super attentive. The Whiskey River BBQ burger's a classic, and the tableside seasoning is delicious. Bottomless steak fries whenever you ask! Lela was super helpful and represented the service I've come to expect well. There's also options for those who don't prefer burgers like salads and chicken sandwiches. The shakes are amazing as well.

This one's a favorite."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this Red Robin.  We always have to wait to be seated anytime we go here.  We've waited anywhere from 15 minutes to and hour.  I don't feel this place is worth the wait!  This particular restaurant is really loud.  The restaurant recently had a remodel which makes the noise a little less, but it is still bad.  Also, this place is very hard to maneuver to the table and even sit down in some places.  I had to squeeze through a 3 in opening to get to my seat in a corner booth the last time we were there.  Other times we felt like our table was placed right in the middle of a major walkway and we kept having to lean forward to let people through.  
Also, each time we go (family is a fan of this place, me not so much) one of our orders is always completely messed up.  I can understand once in a while, but it has been nearly every time.  Twice I've asked for the veggie (I think that is what they call theirs) burger only to find out in the first bite it is beef.  I think it is too loud for the waiter/waitress to hear us!
A couple positives of this place are that the staff is always upbeat and the location is in a good spot.  They also give balloons to the little kids...."}
{"text":"My previous experience with this location is the reason for me returning here. However the quality in service and food has declined significantly. Yesterday I ordered takeout. It took forever to receive my order. The fries were barely warm and the burger was below expectations, nothing like what's advertised. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Red Robin was pretty decent today, hadn't gone back since the meat incident! But I'm glad I got the chance to go back for my free birthday burger. The meat tasted better (season wise,) and juicier, Best Burger in awhile."}
{"text":"I've been going to Red Robin for over 10 years.  They have consistently done a great job with large parties and good burgers.

I have trouble straying from my usual mushroom swiss burger, so I haven't tried many others there, but my friends have and enjoy the different combinations.  They now have healthier options to the bottomless fries... Can you say bottomless broccoli?? hahah.. um. not for me.  But good for my BFF that is health conscious."}
{"text":"Our service is usally really slow which is frustrating. They now offer a veggie burger that is awesome, it's the only reason why we go. Unfortunately, decided to try the black beans for a side and we're disgusted...you can see my pic, they literally opened a can of beans and scooped them into a bowl..not washed, not seasoned, not warmed...just scooped from can to bowl...I nearly threw up I was so grossed out."}
{"text":"Service was decent. Definitely could've been better, the hostesses up front were more like statues than anything else. The restaurant clearly had dirty empty tables and the wait time was 15 minutes. Due to my boyfriend who absolutely loves burgers, I decided to stay. 

I notified them that I would come back and still I came back to waiting 45 minutes before I could even place an order. On the brighter note, they allowed me to try sauces before I could order. The attitude from the one of the waitresses because of their new system at the end was uncalled for. I had issues with the payment and didn't want to leave without making sure the transaction was successful. Unless you have time to spare or are attempting to leave with free food, this is the location. For once the hostess was useful (in taking my money) by checking the system. 

Food: the food was decent and is pretty worth it regarding bottomless fries. Highly recommended the seasonings and to ask for their different sauces before settling on the average ranch or ketchup. The shakes are well-worth the price and are pretty reasonable; which you can order a monster size for a dollar extra. The mud pie at the end was HUGE! 

P.S. Was not charged for the sodas (don't know if they took it out of the bill, or forgot.)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  The place was busy but we were seated quickly and food came fast!  The blue ribbon burger is awesome here.  Red Robin never disappoints!"}

(The waiter, the manager, or even the bartender(Ryan).I don't know how they even got this job in the first place. It is an embarrassment and did not even get to enjoy a beer even though I'm of age. Defiantly poorly trained."}
{"text":"They have installed those Ziosk devices.. this means the waiters have been replaced by a 5\" tablet on your table. Any interaction you had with the wait staff has been replaced with a tablet that constantly tries to get you to play games for a $1.00.

You want drinks.. Enter it in the Ziosk.
You want appetizers.. Enter it in the Ziosk.
You want food.. Enter it in the Ziosk.
You want dessert.. Enter it in the Ziosk.

An actual real person will bring you your food and drinks, but that is only because Ziosk is probably has some sort of non-human based food delivery method in development.

You want to pay your bill.. Enter it in the Ziosk. The Ziosk will politely suggest you give it a 20% tip for the thorough service that it provided. I don't know what a tablet is going to do with money, but maybe it will share with the people that brought me my food.

I don't see the point of dining in anymore. If you want food from here, get it to go."}
{"text":"Lots of gourmet places here in Vegas. Since I live in Henderson, the closest will probably be the one at the M casino ( some gourmet burger and brews place ) anyhow, there are also a few places around town claiming their burgers are gourmet and some knock out fries ( will not mention that place ) come to find out when I get there that most of these places are just another Restaurant Depot ( good place to shop for business ) material product that are pretty much very pre made added with some seasoning. but I have to admit that Red Robin gourmet Burgers are pretty dang good with the bottomless garlic fries and ranch ........ Yum. Just writing this review makes me wanna go back there tomorrow and get down on some crazy Banzai Burgers with garlic fries, unfortunately I can't be pounding on burgers because I can't afford to get any bigger than I am already. But I shall be back. And soon.... When I have a cheat day which is almost everyday. I am so down to pound down that burger. The price of these burgers are almost as much if you go to fat burger or Carl's Jr. It's crazy.... So red robin for me is the way to go. I am not too crazy about burgers but when I am craving for it..... Yes let's go. Plus this location is so perfect ( galleria mall ) eat ( red R ...shop .... dessert ( Cinnabon).  My experience with service in this location has always bee gnarly.... So I dunno what to say about the other reviews , maybe I just kept getting lucky"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals we've experienced. $58 for two children and two adults. Our server said they had staff that were out, but...
Ordered soup instead of fries with my hamburger and got fries.  The soup (which was worse than out of a can) came out when I had finished my meal.  My hamburger was dried out.  
The kids wanted  milkshakes off the kids menu which didn't come out until after the adults were served. The pizza (I use the term very loosely) they ordered was four slices of bread with a dab of sauce and cheese as an afterthought. I couldn't blame them for not eating it! I tasted it and it was truly terrible. And, their food didn't even come out until the adults were almost finished eating. Every parent wants their kinds to fill up on a milkshake first.
Only one refill each on the iced tea and that was the best tasting part of our meal.
Horrible meal.  We won't be back to any Red Robin!!!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money.  Almost five dollars for a strawberry lemonade.  The nine dollar nachos barely had any cheese or other toppings.  I was not happy and asked for the manager.  He took them back and remade them.  They were nothing more than a bunch of chips with minimal toppings.  Now the server brings me some new electronic device and expects me to cash out myself.  Nice gimmicky item but what happened to customer service?  I had the fish and chips, not bad.  My daughter had the California chicken sandwich with fries.  She says it was good.  The bill is here and it exceeds forty five dollars.  We will not be back.  Service and quality are lacking here.  I can get much so more at other local eating establishments with prices equal to food quantity/quality."}
{"text":"Horrible service today,  granted we had 12 in our party and   ordered in between a a table of seven and a party of twenty, but we sat for 1 1/2 hours while the party of seven hot their food, ate and left before we even saw a plate of food.  The table of twenty started getting their food at the same time as us, even though we ordered at least a half hour before them.  We also had to ask to get refills while we waited.  Not sure if we will come here again."}
{"text":"We got stuck going here to burn a gift card and I will say that Phillip was a truly outstanding server. Based on the previous experiences I cannot rate any higher than three stars but Phillip deserves 5 stars himself"}
{"text":"After eating one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had at a Red Robin in Center Valley, PA, I was extremely excited to go to Red Robin at downtown Summerlin because it was close to my house. I told my family it was going to be great, and convinced them to come with me to show them how good it was. When we got there, the wait staff was very friendly and I was super excited to get my prime chophouse veggie burger. While other tables were seated and served, my table waited 45 minutes before we got our food. When the burgers showed up, I forgot about waiting because I was so excited to eat! When we got the food it was extremely disappointing. The burgers were missing ingredients, and they just did not taste good. I'm so upset, and I hope the management improves this restaurant. I had really high hopes that it would be good, now I'm just sad and disappointed because I'll never have a veggie burger like I had at another red robin, close to home. Please fix your burgers."}
{"text":"This was my second time, and both times the food came out cold and took 45 minutes. It was so hard to get our waitress' attention. We wanted drink refills, french fry refills, and even to get the check - and when we finally got her attention, she seemed so annoyed. She forgot my friend's alcoholic drink and got her sandwich wrong three times. Seriously, a bad experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! Used to go to Chicago to eat at Red Robin so to have one nearby is amazing. We usually get pick up and the service is great. Kelly at the bar is super nice and professional. I always get a cup of fries and water while I'm waiting for my order. I know you can also wait in your car and they will deliver the food out to you and take care of everything. 

We love their food, especially the Royal Red Robin burger, their freckled lemonade (bottomless), their onion ring appetizer, steak fries (bottomless), and sweet potato fries (bottomless). You can't get better than unlimited fries and drinks. We've also never had issues with incorrect orders."}
{"text":"Brand new location but these people have it together! I've been to this new location twice and had to wait just a short while both times. There is a bar, which has been at 100% capacity both times, but you are able to walk up and order a drink while you wait. The hostess did this for us on our first visit, which I thought was an excellent and surprising level of service.
The burgers are fantastic---SO many to choose from! I've always gotten the bacon cheeseburger...call me predictable. But I know what I like. Bacon.
Burger cooked to your doneness preference (pink/no pink) served with endless fries. Food arrives quickly and served by whomever is available near the kitchen when the order is put in the pass. I think that makes SO much sense! Manager-types aplenty asking if everything is ok, willing to refill drinks and run for napkins (you'll need them)
Reasonable price $15 or less/person. The service and the burgers both are outstanding"}
{"text":"Excellent service. I got the insane romaine. I got sick afterwards though soo I'll have to try red robin again. U.U"}
{"text":"Service is good overall. The have happy hour all day. The food is not healthy, but treats great! The Blue Ribbon burger is delicious. My bf liked his colossus burger. The fries are decent,  but love that they have a range of dipping choices for them."}
{"text":"I know remember why I don't come to Red Robin anymore. Service is slow even for a weekday it took 30mins for food to come and the sever barely checked on us. My husband ended up drinking my glass of water because no one ever came to check if we needed refills! When we asked for an extra basket of their endless fries it came out cold!"}
{"text":"Got the free appetizer, the onion ring tower, coulda stopped there. My wife had the AvoCabo and I had the Southwest Salad. Everting we could of asked for. Speaking of asked for, our waitress was very attentive and was very friendly.
Always havre s good time and meal when we go to Red Robin. It's our go to place. Even when we don't have burgers."}
{"text":"Great burgers, bottomless fries, and top notch servers...customer service is 85% of the reason I am satisfied with a restaurant and Red Robin nails it each and every time.  The host/hostesses are friendly, the servers are always pleasant and efficient, and the  managers are engaged, ensuring customers have an awesome dining experience.  

Reasonably priced tasty burgers coupled with top notch service!  Red Robin...yummmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I went to Reb Robin on Friday (Veterans Day observed) and say they had the \"Table Set for One\" on display for customers to observe. I thought that was very heartwarming given the Holiday and I love how they included that touch to honor Veterans. On top of that the service the waitress provided was exceptional. Unfortunately I cannot remember her name but she was the nicest lady who did her best to ensure we felt comfortable and had everything we needed. When the food came it was exactly how we ordered and fresh off the grill. Amazing service, great food, and they honored our veterans.. what more can you ask for? Great job Red Robin!"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative rating I would.  My husband and I decided late on Valentine's Day to go to Red Robin.. Where we often go.  The place was filthy.  It was past prime time so there wasn't a wait.  Realize there is only 2 of us.  I order a gin and tonic with lime and my husband orders a beer.  When the server (unknown name because he had no name tag on). He threw down the beer in front of me and the gin and tonic with no lime in front of my husband.  After trying to get his attention numerous times I got up and went to bar for my own lime.  No bartender around.  Then a women threw a lime on a stick in my drink and said here.  Then the chicken we ordered was served, obviously the chicken orders were placed in front of the wrong person, but even the sauce was not right.  Then my husband went to the bathroom.  It was so filthy he came out and said he'd wait.  We were so disappointed we asked to see a manager after we paid the bill and we were leaving.  Finally a woman came up front. Didn't introduce herself, and as we were telling her our story she says. Yea yea ok ii know about your lime.  Then my husband asked her about her name tag... \"I'm a manager and I don't have to wear a name tag\".  I don't know Red Robin's policy but I would hope the chain would have some standards for cleanliness.  This no name manager didn't, and I don't have to patron Red Robin."}
{"text":"I love Red Robin's but didn't enjoy the service we had here all too well. It's at the mall so of course it's packed which I didn't mind. Wait time wasn't too long. The burger bun was soaked when it reached us and \"bottomless fries\" are more of wait over 15 minutes to get next order of fries. Burger bland and service was blah. Towards the end it felt really rushed like they needed the table. Upside is clean restaurant. Our server was cool just overall food service was slow from all food delivering. Better locations are Summerlin and North Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Although the food was good at the Eastern location, the service last night was HORRIBLE!!!!  Not only were we surrounded by dirty, uncleared tables for the majority of our dinner, but our server was absent for most of the time as well!  Our waters were served in plastic cups and we were told they ran out of glassware.  No biggie, except as the night went on, guests who arrived after us were receiving their drinks in glassware.  I also ordered a regular chocolate shake and that was sitting at the bar (in a small plastic cup) for about 10 -15 minutes!!  

Our food came out and I had to ask for my shake.  When asked if this was a regular sized shake, our server said yes.  We've ordered regular sized shakes here many times and we have never received it in a plastic cup nor in a size that small!

Food was good, but fries were not given in a large quantity.  We actually had to ask for more fries before we were even halfway done with our burgers, just to wait 15 minutes for them! For a burger joint fries shouldn't take that long to get refilled especially if you're known for bottomless fries.

We were just about done with our meal when they finally started cleaning the tables around us.  I had to ask someone for our check because once again, our server was nowhere to be found.  

Overall, this location has gone downhill, and we were truly disappointed last night."}
{"text":"Came to celebrate my supervisors birthday, so me and my subordinate treated her to this place.  And such a lovely place this was.  

This location was super clean, super inviting, and the staff was super friendly, super attentive!!  The food was super delicious but the wait was super long!!  Fortunately the unlimited fries keep on coming.  They were super yummy and was my down fall, I ate so much fries I didn't have much room to enjoy my wings.  But it was okay, still all delicious.  

Overall everyone enjoyed their food, and had a lovely experience.  Will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"I will NOT be going back to this location. I went there last night and got food poisoning. I know it was from there because I did not have much to eat yesterday and I doubt that my apple caused it. And it was right after we finished dinner and the stabbing stomach pain and sweating began. As soon as I arrived home, it was in full effect. My husband called the manager while I was \"indisposed\" and was told that everything was served \"at temp\" and that it pretty much isn't their problem. My husband got food poisoning from there a few months back but we thought that maybe it was just a fluke. I'm guessing not. I still feel horrible today and feel like this was totally dismissed by the management at this location."}
{"text":"This place ceases to disappoint me. Burgers, shakes are not in my daily diets or regimen but here I stuff my face with their fresh grilled mouth watering gift served with bottomless everything!"}
{"text":"I have usually had decent experiences at various Red Robins but saw a ton of bad reviews for this one. Fortunately I think it is consistent with other locations and I had a positive experience. The service was quick and accurate, when we needed something had no trouble catching the server's eye, she wasn't doing that intentional thousand yard stare thing. I had the $6.99 mac & cheese double burger, parts where the buzz sauce didn't make it to that portion were a bit dry but overall definitely worth seven bucks. The bill for 2 adults and 2 kids was $33 plus tip, including a bottomless root beer float. As for the wait to sit down it was 15 minutes but the process allows you to sit in your car if you prefer and get a text when your table is ready. Definitely a crowd lingering outside even before 6 pm on a Saturday.  One odd thing I will point out is for some reason the way the tables are arranged you get a lot of inadvertent eye contact with other patrons as you look around the room. That might be something that calls for a scientific study."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. My wife and I went in for lunch, got seated and was promptly forgotten. After 20 minutes of watching everyone else get served we asked for a manager who apologized and offered to take our order. We said no thank you and left. If it was busy we would expect delays in getting a glass of water and our order taken but it wasn't and we got nothing so we left and Red Robin lost our business."}
{"text":"Best location in vegas!
Not only great burgers, but the best customer service that I have ever had!
They were slammed and everything was still awesome!"}
{"text":"I gave them another chance. It was much better. Service was spot on and the menu had changed.  It was really good. Sat at the bar I will be back"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times since my wife likes it.  Meh.  I could live without it but they do cater to children so that is a big reason why we continue to eat there."}
{"text":"thought this place was better than average.  plenty of parking and we didn't have to wait to be seated.  menu had something for everyone.  our server was on top of everything.  i got the cheeseburger and it was huge!  the fat fries were yummy!  it was so much food that i could eat anything else the rest of the day."}
{"text":"We sat for 10 minutes before being acknowledged by a server. Then it took another 10 minutes to get water. Good thing we weren't thirsty. A father and son sat next to us and received their drinks before us. Once the server recognized how upset I was, he got our order in quick. First impression is a lasting impression."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST dining experience I've had in a long time! My son took me to dinner and a movie. Our server, Akila, was aware of our time restraint and took great care of us. The hostess and server both were prompt and very friendly. The food was delicious and as ordered. Neither my son not myself have anything bad to say about our experience. Thank you for reminding us how it should be done!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this red Robin from the beginning to the end of my date. We arrived at 230 on Friday so it wasn't busy. Hostess was ok but the guy server was just plain awful. Good was good but again the guy server at the time was the server I have ever seen. He acted like we took precious time away from him bsing with mgr bartender cooks. I saw him do this at the tables he had. Very disappointed. The saving Grace was the burger."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere and the server was extremely friendly. Me and my girlfriend had the ghost pepper burger and the BLTA. Both were really good and had a very good flavor. The bun was prefect, not too much bread and flowed well with every bite. I will be coming back to this convenient location and enjoying and trying more of the menu!"}
{"text":"The burger was good and a good value. \"The Bottomless Fries\" ruined the meal as you can order more fries but you just can't get more fries. PLEASE Don't ADVERTISE the fries as bottomless when it takes twenty minutes AFTER the meal is finished to get them. I actually enjoy the food but can't stand the BS advertising. The service was horrible today"}
{"text":"I was a vegetarian for 30 years. After 20 years of killing my poor hubby's steaks, I finally watched enough Food Network to be able to make him a perfect steak. He licked the plate. Anyway, I finally gave in and tried steak. Turns out, I LOVE beef. I started slow, but finally tried a hamburger for the first time about a month ago. I did not like it at all. Ground meat has a very odd texture to someone who has never eaten it before. It was a homemade burger.
Fast forward to today. I had a gift card someone had given me, so we came in to check it out. We ordered the onion ring tower (awesome!), I got a bacon cheeseburger (huge!) with the garlic fries, one of my daughters got a burger and fries and my other daughter got the mac and cheese and steak fries (this daughter is vegetarian). I was terrified I'd hate it, but I totally get it now!!! That bacon cheeseburger has changed my life! It was simple, but exactly what I wanted. No, it was exactly what I NEEDED. I am now a fan of burgers, for the first time in my life. I'm very picky, so you can count on me to come back and order the same thing every time because I know it'll be great.
I also need to mention that my daughter's mac and cheese was to DIE for! We live across town, and I almost ordered more to go so we could have it again for dinner. 
Cheyenne was our server, and she was crazy busy, but super nice and really great, as was everyone else who helped us. The restaurant was very clean (except for a few greasy burger paw prints on the way out the doors lol), and the ladies room was also nice and clean (I cannot stand dirty bathrooms in food establishments). 
Overall, we had a wonderful experience and will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Significant improvement from the last time we came here. Started out with a short stack of onion rings and ordered a couple salads. The onion rings come with a delicious, tangy Carolina BBQ sauce that is a must try. I ordered the Southwest Sombrero salad, a fancy Mexican Cobb salad and my date ordered a crispy chicken salad. It was better than expected to be honest. 

I gave it four stars because it was good food for the value, subtotal right around $25. Looking for a decent burger (or salad) joint with no frills, look no further. Red Robin is your place to go."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. GRAND OPENING and today. Both experiences substandard. My husband loves the Blue Burger here. I will say our server was a sweetheart, thanks Yaya. The manager today, whomever he is, no name tag is not very personable didn't smile once while he passed back and forth - not even when he dropped off my drink (frozen margarita).  We lucked out with the server, she's friendly and very attentive. Everyone else just seem to be going through the motions. Just an observation.  BTW my favorite location is the Gateway Pavillions. I love that restaurant concept, awesome outdoor patio and everyone is on HAPPY MODE even the bartenders make the whole experience FUN. I sent an email to Red Robin customer service about my experience here for grand opening. Never heard back from them. Oh well."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about my Red Robin experience. I've become a regular of sorts eating here at least once every couple months lately. The service is fast and efficient ie: the table check out.  This time around I had the pickle nickels which are pickles fried in a panko bread crust with a delicious sauce. I love them. I do have to say today though they were way too salty. My thoughts are that when you are already using a salty dill pickle slice there is no need to add any salt. I probably should have sent them back but didn't. I ordered the whiskey row burger which had onion strings, cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo and a tasty barbecue sauce. Super yummy. It comes with fries but you can have any side you want with it. I got the onion rings. What a tasty lunch. My server Tim was awesome. Check it out for a comfortable lunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"My family and I will pass the red robin on silverado ranch just to come to this one! The customer service is spot on. We always have full drinks, waiter/waitress' happy to see we brought our son, hot and fast service!! Our last trip we had genie as our waitress! This girl alone is worth every penny spent here! She was very friendly, happy and efficient! Menu is unique and delicious!! Price is average cost of any family restaurant."}
{"text":"Usually this is the place  to go when you want a good burger.  I've been let down.  Not only was my burger cooked incorrectly, I had to flag down another server to get it remade and my server seemed annoyed by the fact I asked for it to be remade.  A manager never came to the table to apologize or to offer anything while I waited.   Everyone else was already finished eating and ready to go before my food was even cooked.  I had to ask for it all to go.  A manager still never came to the table.   I tried to call and wasn't even able to get one on the phone.  Very disappointing"}
{"text":"The food and service was very good my only issue was with where we were seated . The floor was full of food (probably from a baby) and crumbs on my seat but you think they would clean it before they sat the next person down it was nasty I was smashing it into the carpet and it wasn't just where we sat there was quite a few other places that I could see.This was at the Peoria location."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience.  Arrived at 7:30p on a Monday evening and was seated right away.  Ordered two glasses of wine.   5 minutes later our waitress returned to take our dinner order.  So far everything ok.  35 minutes later still no food.  The waitress came by to apologize and said she would bring some fries and we ordered two more wines.  Another 10 minutes passed and still no wine or fries.  Finally at 8:30 our dinner arrived and then the wine.  The manager delivered the food and said he cooked it.....really??????   Just a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Pretty hip looking place. Very crowded on a Friday night but no waiting. Love the appetizers, we had the stacked onion rings and the sauces they serve with it are delish! Friendly staff but not overwhelming and considering it being so busy everyone was on top of their game. Clean bathrooms. Hot and fairly good burgers, hubby wasn't too impressed. Some burgers aren't a bad price, around $7 but if you stray beyond that it's way more than I feel like spending."}
{"text":"Waiters have become unaware of the products it seems since they rely heavily on the electronic order taker. That tool is such a pain in the butt. You want to give your card to the waiter but the waiter is giving you a tutorial on how to pay using their tool. It's like they're preparing us for the day that their job will no longer exist."}
{"text":"Huge restaurant with a nice bar that has a lot of drink choices. Menu is expansive. Great choice of appetizers and desserts in addition to their lunch/dinner menu. My favorite burger is the Red Robin Royal as it's a 6 ounce patty topped with cheese, bacon, sunny side up egg, and their special sauce. It's awesome! The fried fish sandwich is one of my go tos as well. The French fries are tasty but I enjoy their onion rings more. Fried pickles as an appetizer is a good way to start your Red Robin experience and the mud pie is a good way to end it. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"This location gets pretty busy as it is located inside of the Galleria Mall. They've done some remodeling and it looks very modern and nice. I sat in the bar area and Chandra was our waitress. She was awesome and attentive. I got the royal burger which is my go to and it never disappoints. The bottomless fries are always a plus!"}
{"text":"Red Robin just doesn't get it. Boca burger cold again. Cheese not even melted. Different location but same bad service. Eating onion rings eating for Boca burger ...second try at it. Get it right RR!!  Okay, sautéed mushroom, no grilled. Left off the tomato on second try too. Manager Deven."}
{"text":"We recently had a family lunch at the Red Robin \"Gourmet\" Hamburgers on Tropical Ave. in Las Vegas. How can a chain that specializes in burgers produce such a horrible burger experience? There were eight of us and we all agreed that the burgers and other sandwiches were awful. On a bright note the onion ring appetizer tower and beer were delicious, almost like they were cooked in a different kitchen. Our server was also decent.
We were told that the wait would be fifteen minutes, more like thirty minutes. I would not recommend eating at Red Robin due to the fact that they can't master what they are known for, burgers.  McDonald's or Burger King have better burgers."}
{"text":"Well, had to make the trip for my son's birthday . . . I was hoping for something more upscale . . . but it is always the birthday boy's choice.

Had a short wait . . . expected but not unusual . . . problem . . . four groups that arrived after us of the same size got seated before us . . . and even though we asked for a table (which all four of them got) . . . they wanted to squeeze me, a 400 pound man,  into a booth . . . NOT happening.

Table finally located . . . time to order.  Thought I'd try something different that my usual . . . The BLTA Croissant . . . B is for BACON . . . where is the bacon . . . one slice, are you kidding me.  Steak Fries . . . COLD . . . Iced Tea  . . . CLOUDY . . . Desert . . . didn't want to chance it.

The only reason that I am giving them two stars . . . the server tried her best to take care of us and right the kitchen's wrongs . . . oh well . . . I won't have to return for a year . . . unless . . . I can convince my son to go somewhere else next year . . ."}
{"text":"I was really surprised to see how dead this place was today . . . not too long ago, I could remember having to wait for a table at lunch if you weren't here by 11:30.  This had me a little worried, but I was pleasently surprized.

I ordered the Southwestern Chicken Salad and an Iced Tea.  The drink arrived quickly and tasted freshk brewed, was clear, and cold.  My lunch arrived shorly later and I was  extremely happy . . . the salad wad still cold, and the chicken was nice and hot.  With all of the toppings, the salad was full of flavors and the spices on the chicken were just right.

Hopefully time will get better and this place will pick-up again for the lunch rush . . . even though I did like like it like this."}
{"text":"definitely not going to come back here here again. I ordered the prime chophouse burger which I hoped would be good but was very disappointing. It didn't have any hint of horseradish, very less onion strings, the patty was very thin and the coleslaw side didn't have any seasoning. if you are going to spend 11$ on a burger, there are far better options."}
{"text":"Service sucked. Came in for lunch with my wife ordered chips and artichoke dip but for some weird reason the chips had salsa stains on them \"re used chips\". Had empty drinks whole time we were there. Food sucked burger had no flavor and was cold. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"We usually get our orders to go from the bartender Christina! My family that visits from out of town loves to eat here as well so we usually like to sit in the bar area. 

I usually order the crispy chicken sandwich and the fries are bottomless when you dine in. They also have a rewards system that you can get some discounts with too.  Also their onion rings are really good, not sure what other sauce that comes with it but it does come with ranch and something else.  When my mom comes to town she loves to get her mushroom burger craving fix from here.  

The mudd pie dessert is usually what we get too. It's a huge slice of ice cream pie and it's amazing! Enough to share with someone else."}
{"text":"8mins for a waitress to come out of the back and ask what we wanted to drink and take our order. Waitress said she had a difficult order she had to put in, thats why it took so long. So okay give her a break on that but seriously it took 25mins for the food to come out after ordering and it was barely warm. Plus mine was wrong. The two couples who came in 10mins after us got there food at the same time. Asked for more fries they weren't even warm. Definitely blame management cause clearly the waitress didn't have the capability to take care of that # tables and were barely there to support their employee."}
{"text":"Went to Red Robin for dinner the other night. We got the Chili Chili Con Queso as an appetizer. When it came out, I was surprised to see how few chips were on the plate. Most places give you a big basket of chips. $7 worth? Not so much. We forgot to say no salsa garnish on the queso so we had to scoop off the tomato chunks. But the queso tasted good and we even had some left over to dip our fries in.
I ordered the Banzai Burger (no pink), and no lettuce, tomato, or mayo. That is one of three burgers I like to get. My other favorites are the Whiskey River BBQ Burger and the Royal Red Robin. My burger was cooked right and tasted good. I enjoyed dipping the fries in the leftover queso dip. I have to say I kind of miss the days when your food came in a basket and the burger was partly wrapped in paper. They are trying to be fancy now with the rectangular plates and bottomless metal cylinder for the fries.
We asked our server for some more napkins and she brought us two. They sure are stingy with napkins here! She did a pretty good job keeping our waters refilled. And while she didn't ask if we wanted more fries, my friend requested some and she brought us a basket. Yay steak fries! Red Robin... YUMMMM"}
{"text":"We usually sit in the bar area, but service has been hit or miss there so we opted for the dining room. Our table was one that is just inches from another table on either side so there is absolutely no semblance of privacy and you can hear your neighbors' entire conversations. I hated it. We should've asked to move... but we stayed.
I ordered the Royal Red Robin. No lettuce, tomato, or mayo with no pink and the egg fried hard. The little tray they serve the napkins and silverware on had some ketchup on it so it dirtied one of the napkins. Gross. We had to ask for a new one. My burger was very good, but my b/f requested the peppercorn sauce for his on the side, which he got, but they also put it on the burger... He mentioned it to the waitress and she said she wrote down \"on the side\" so she didn't know why they put it on... and she halfheartedly asked if he wanted them to remake it, but reluctantly he said it was okay. Also the fries weren't super fresh. And a few of them tasted like dirt, even in the second basket.
Get it together, Red Robin! At least we got buy one, get one 50% off..."}
{"text":"This Galleria Mall location sucks!  Long wait just to order our food, then I should have known it was terrible when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands.  I just about slipped walking there. The floor was not only greasy but dirty. Then I opened the bathroom door and those floors were even dirtier.  
The food came and was mediocre. I got charged for sweet potato fries even though I had told the server I didn't want them. The waiter also forgot about giving us a refill or fries after we ordered them. 
He then had the manager come to the table to correct the incorrect fries charge. Well he was totally rude and told me there was a charge for the upgraded fries.... instead of apologizing for their mistake, he made me feel like I was trying to get free fries. Ridiculous.  Never will go here again!
Horrible experience"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by for dinner before close on Friday.  The food was prepared as expected and our server Ashley was awesome! She was friendly and had a great attitude, even with our many refills on the Root Beer Float, fries, and broccoli. Staff is always friendly here and attentive."}
{"text":"Have to stop for the night in Phoenix due to airline delay 
Very few choices as far as dining goes near the airport.
Red Robin was one of the choices. The ribs were very good, the Hamburgers we're good, the salad bar was quite poor and too commercial.
The service was excellent! 
the biggest problem we had was the foul odor coming from the bar!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good especially since I had three small kids and no other adults. The food was good like always, except when did they start making the fried zucchini so big??? For an appetizer they should be bite size; not half a zucchini. I was disappointed because fried zucchini is my fav appetizer, but this was difficult to eat."}
{"text":"My wife and I,my son and his little family stop here on a weekday for dinner. We usually order the burgers with bottomless fries and that been one of our favorite. The bottomless fries are a nice treat, but really?? I can't expect the server to deliver bottomless fries on demand all the time which gets frustrating. The burgers are pretty good my opinion, and as for the beers are bit pricey on the Dos Equis draft beers. We could have easily bought two six packs for the price of those two draft beers. Oh well shit happens.  Have say my granddaughter love her Lil' Appetites Cluck-A-Doodles, and bottomless fries. And to see her smile on her little face makes me happy, so thanks Red Robin.   

Overall:
However you get what you pay for. It is a nice atmosphere and the service has always been good. The food fresh and hot."}
{"text":"I love red robin, the whiskey river chicken wraps is my hands down favorite thing on the menu the only problem is the prices! Ten bucks for a chicken wrap is extreme so we don't eat there very often but when I do it is always good."}
{"text":"My family came to Red Robin for my fiance's birthday meal. We asked several times for crayons bc the baby was antsy with the kids menu in front of him...and used to coloring to pass the time. Had to go ask the Manager to finally get any crayons! Looked at the menu &I  asked about the mayo in the picture on the Southern Charm burger (which is NOT on the description on the menu at all! They have since corrected it online but menu does NOT have mayo on the menu in restaurant!)so I ordered my burger minus mayo-waiter said \"it isn't mayo, its aoli\"....I said \"aoli is made with mayo & I don't eat it at all, so no mayo or aoli, whatever it is please!\"  

We received our food,my burger was slathered with the mayo/aoli! Had to send it back of course. My Whole family got their food & ate all theirs,yet still no replacement food. Manager came over & asked if I wanted MORE fries...I said \"I never got ANY fries at all, they took my plate back\". Still waited & waited. Asked to just cancel my meal so we can leave. The manager apologized & said I should have asked for no mayo.....I DID. No may, no aoli, whatever it was, I covered my bases! She then offered to make the meal on the house & pack it so I can take it w me,hesitated, but said ok. 

Well opened it a couple hrs later....frankly I wasn't jazzed about eating anything coming from there at this point. 
Well apparently even the \"free take home meal\" burger was even more incorrect as the first time! I Got a burger patty, cheese, lettuce, a piece of bacon on a ciabatta bun. No carmelized onions, no bbq sauce, no brown sugar glaze, no tomato I added....all I wanted was the no mayo/aoli that is NOT even listed on the menu, but I saw & inquired about bc its in the picture. I was given a dry bacon cheeseburger w lettuce. Why would I pay $13.99 for a bacon cheeseburger & not just get a reg ole burger?! 

Well- Every single time we come...my order is messed up! I don't eat condiments, so it shouldn't be this frickin difficult to request 1 item to be left off!!! 

No longer coming here...even for the free birthday burger-it will be messed up garanteed!

Follow up: an apology for it being screwed up not only once, but twice! Also told me to try them again sometime! No replacement meal....will we go back again???? Not a snowballs chance in HELL! Asked for my ph number & email-for what? So they can NOT call & apologize? Didn't even get that much! We'll stick with restaurants that actually care about their customers!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch on the way to a work function. The last time I was at a RR, they offered a GF bun but it was the Udi's brand which is akin to cardboard. So was interested that they offered a different brand, one I was not familiar with and the name escapes me. But it was soft and not bad. It wasn't as tasty as I had hoped but the softness made for an overall good burger experience. The fries were average. The service was pretty good, it wasn't terribly busy."}
{"text":"Always good. Never have a problem at this location. I'll always comeback to this establishment. It's kind of like my very own Cheers bar, only with burgers."}
{"text":"I can't believe what just happened to me here. I was just in there the night before and I had my usual Red Robin Royal budget, and it was pretty good. So today when I went in there, they tried to serve me a red Raven double with egg on it. You can obviously tell the difference in the two burgers based on size. I eat there all the time. When I told them to take it back, the manager came out and yelled at me in front of other people saying it is the royal burger, which it wasn't. When I tried to explain that I know the difference between the two, she began to immediately yell \"call the police.\" I was so embarrassed, I wasn't yelling or causing a scene at all, and she yelled for her staff to call the police out loud so everyone could here. I'll be sharing this review for everyone I know on Facebook and on Instagram. They should be ashamed of themselves. What happened to the customer is always right."}
{"text":"This was by far ny most frustrating experience  at a Red Robbin. I check the reviews of this location versus the other two, and there is a reason people don't like this location. Totally bad experience last night.
First off, when we were seated, our waiter screwed up our drink order, then took almost 20 minutes to make the simple change we requested in the first place. Our burgers were pretty good as always, but our french fries were ice cold, and ever refill we got was ice cold as well. The fries were disgusting all night long.
Our waiter seemed more interested in standing around in our plain sight socializing with coworkers,  than seeing if we were ok. we were there for almost an hour, we seen him 3 times, and once aas to talk our initial order. 
if I was the manager of this Red Robbin, I'd really try to see why more people prefer the other locations as opposed to theirs, and take a serious look at what they're doing wrong."}
{"text":"I love it nice service food excellent
and our server Britney was so sweet I give to her  +A...
Thanks continue with this service and very good taste"}
{"text":"For an inexpensive place this doesn't disappoint. We love the bottomless options and the burgers are ok. Know what they do best over the top burgers don't go for the plain stuff, tavern burger just disappoints."}
{"text":"Chain hamburger joint.  Wide selection of burgers done well, accompanied by a basket of \"endless\" fries, and any burger can be replaced with a boca patty for a vegetarian option.

Actually, really really good burgers.  On the minus side, service seems to be hit or miss, and you're looking at an $8 hamburger, plus drinks."}
{"text":"Tonight's service sucked.  I come here a lot and know the manager personally.  Usually things flow pretty well.  Lit up tablets get quickly answered and they almost never forget to bring you sauce/ fries. Well tonight I didn't see Amy there, no biggy.  But our waitress only gave us attention when we ordered and when it was time to pay the bill.  And she was so rude when we left.  First we ate the food which took longer then usual.  About 30 mins.  Then we wanted more frys.  But no one would answer the pages, hand waves or simple eye co tact to gain attention.  They forgot our sauces everytime we managed to get someone's attention. Frys was cold. We asked for assistance like 3 times and 20-30 mins would go by and nothing would happen. Didn't refill our drinks till the third waitress came over. So we spent most of the night waiting.  And waiting... time came to pay the bill and all the sudden our waitress appears out of no where, rudely hovers over the tablet while we are picking the tip n just stares at us.  We didn't tip.  And Im normally  very giving. She then asked what we needed and did we want drinks to go.  No.  I needed your attention a long time ago. She totally ignored us.  On the plus side the burgers was good. Bottomless frys didn't exist for us tonight.  Quite frankly our worst experience here so far. Pay attention to your customers.  Don't forget about them and bring what you said u would.  Keep drinks filled. That's my tip for them."}
{"text":"I came here today.  Ordered the big buzz mac n cheese burger. No veggies.  And American instead of peppperjack.  It came with onions and lettuce.  Ok so I send it back. And the new one comes back with noodles soaked in ranch not cheese.  But no internal onions but there was under the bottom bun. Easy to remove. . It didn't have the right sauces on it it normally has. I didn't send it back cause at that point I wasn't even hungry anymore and I didn't wanna tick anyone off more then they already were. They look so disturbed/upset when you get a redo.  The truth is over the past few years, everytime I go to this particular place, they always mess up my order.  No place else does that.  I hate sending food back. I love Red Robin in general I just will not be returning to this location again. Was sopose to be a nice fun meal with my husband and kids. And well when everyone is eating at different times due to mistakes it's no fun for anyone. And quite frankly a waste of money."}
{"text":"After being a frequent customer for years I will never come back again. My fiance and I first walked in and we see a teenager just sitting on the counter texting. Once he saw us he jumped down and said \"my bad haha\" and walked us to our table. I ordered the clam chowder.. I didn't expect anything magical considering I am ordering from a burger joint but when my food was brought out to me it was still cold in the middle and as well as the sides of the bowl. I told our waitress and she had the manager bring me out a new one and as he gave it to me he never said one word even after I said thank you, as if this was my fault. He then went to our waitress and starred at me and my fiance while they talked... perhaps about us. I will not return here again rude staff and low quality food."}
{"text":"Wow! The staff here is supper friendly and very attentive. That alone doesn't get 5 stars from me since that type of service is expected. What warrants that 5th star was the manager. She was very fast to let us know there was an issue even before we knew there was a issue. She even took the food off the bill before hand. That to me is going the extra mile of great service. Awesome Job!"}
{"text":"My wife, grandson and I had lunch there today. My wife's burger was just fine. I ordered the Chili Chili Cheeseburger which was cooked properly, but came with very little chili and even less cheese.  Our waitress brought me a cup of chili with a little cheese on it to add to my burger. My grandson has their kids pizza which came to us looking like it hadn't been cut. We spent $27.00 for this and I do feel ripped off."}
{"text":"I've had service issues here in past years and I avoided Red Robin for a while.  After returning a couple of months ago and having a decent experience, I decided to go back again tonight.  The food was decent but the service was horrible.  It took almost 20 minutes before the waitress came to take my order, and I had to walk up to the bar and get my own refill 3 times, after my glass sat empty on the table for 10+ minutes, each time.  Botomless fries are a nice touch, if you can get the waiter/waitress to order them for you.  I waited 15 minutes for a fry refill before she decided to yell into the kitchen for more.  By then I was done with my meal, and didn't want any more fries.  After overhearing my waitress order my fries 15 minutes after I walked to the bar to request more -- I asked her to cancel the order, as I was ready to go.  Very disappointing how little attention the wait staff gives customers.  After a long day of work and paying $20 for a burger, fries, and iced tea, I expected better service, especially since there were only 6 people in the bar area where I was seated.  Very distracted and inattentive wait staff.  If you're looking for a quick bite, and attentive service, I can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm so hesitant to complain about bad service, because I know wait staff does not get paid much, BUT.  Red Robin isn't the cheapest restaurant around, and I was paying for this.  Went on Sunday, and yes the restaurant was crowded.  If it's understaffed, then that's a management problem.  But our waitress was obviously in a rush the whole time.  She'd set something down on the table and quickly turn and leave, before we could ask for anything else.  She didn't check on us, and was avoiding eye contact when we were trying to flag her down.  It really affected our meal - we had just taken the kids to see Santa at the mall, and I was looking forward to a nice lunch.  Will look for somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Bleu Burger was delicious. I'm a fan of it for now.
And berry lemonade is gorgeous...
Staff is very friendly and talkative. 
Fries was a little hard for me. But it's OK.
I suggest it to my friends."}
{"text":"After expressing my concerns, management contacted me and wished to earn my business.

So we gave them another shot. This time service was much better and the food was good. 

We were greeted and seated promptly. Our server was attentive and met our needs without having to be tracked down.

The food was tasty and well prepared."}
{"text":"Although hostess indicated a 20 minute wait and we were ready to leave with our 3 hungry kids, the manager said he could get us a table more quickly and we were seated within 5 minutes.  Our server was new, and was honest that the happy hour beer specials really weren't special.  So we paid $6 each for craft brews which were not on happy hour.  The restaurant was packed, and our server was clearly overwhelmed but very sweet.  All dishes were delivered except spouse's burger.  After 10 long minutes and no burger, the manager happened along and I flagged him down.  The burger was ready and waiting, just never delivered.  Food is standard chain bar food, quality acceptable, not memorable.  And why is this the only restaurant chain without free wifi?"}
{"text":"Stopped in to place a to-go order. Wait time was decent considering it was dinner hour. A server had brought out an extra serving of fries by mistake and offered them to me while I waited so that was nice. Food was decent and reasonably priced. They currently have a few burgers/fries for 6.99. Will probably be back."}
{"text":"I had a gift card so I checked it out. Not bad, but not too memorable either. It's a burger sports bar chain restaurant. I tried to be healthier by getting the lettuce bun and it worked well. The Bonzai burger was pretty tasty when tho I don't normally like teriyaki much. Broccoli on the side, completely plain and unseasoned which is fine."}
{"text":"Your typical family burger place.  The wait staff is usually friendly and efficient. The food is ok, I recommend the garlic fries they are bottomless. It is usually a bit on the noisy side."}
{"text":"Horrible service.   Our waitress obviously did not want to be there she even said so we were left unattended for 90% of our meal meaning she did not come to refill our empty glasses we ordered some sauce for dipping the french fries never came but we were charge for them.  This was our second visit this location and we will not be coming back it was just not a very pleasant experience at all."}
{"text":"Burger was average, steak fries were below average since they were barely even cooked (how do you screw up French fries?!), and we never saw our waiter again after the appetizer was dropped off. Our drinks were empty, we needed napkins, and our ketchup bottle was empty, ugh."}
{"text":"alright so my review is of the staff at this location unfortunately was a horrible enough experience that I want to voice my concerns.... so  first off it was not busy alright there were only about 5 tables total in the entire half of the restaurant we were in that there is no excuse for the waitress to be completely blissful of us needing our drinks refilled when the cups are sitting empty on the end of the table point blank where she kept standing in direct sight secondly when she would attend our table she was extremely rude and short with us and when we requested dipping sauces she flat out didn't bring them after we asked several times had to waive down another passing server! unacceptable red robin you need to teach your staff to be more attentive to the clients because I have never been so astonished at how rude these staff was!!!!will not everrrr return to this location!"}
{"text":"We just ate at this Red Robin. We were pretty disappointed. We asked for gravy with our fries. We were given so sort of lukewarm meat water. They then had to \"cook\" the actual gravy. My son left 4 little toys on our table we returned within 5 minutes and \"nobody saw then and there was nothing they could do about it\".  When we left we were approached by a patron who was there while we were eating said they saw an employee take them... Pretty shady"}
{"text":"Ordered the Southern Charm burger served with fries and it was both delicious and smothered with BBQ deliciousness. The fries were a little soft to my liking, and wasn't as much as a I anticipated. The menu stated \"bottomless steak fries\" so I figured there would be a ton of fries, but they were just placed in a container that was \"bottomless\" ;;;,,,,444774haha. All in all my burger was great. 

My boyfriend and I got here at around 6:45-7:00pm on a Thursday and it was very busy with large groups and families. We only waited for about 5 minutes to be seated. Vanessa was our waitress and she was absolutely sweet and attentive to our needs. This place also sings Happy Birthday to customers if their birthday was on that day. There are no Red Robbin restaurants back in Hawaii, so thought I'd try it out and ended up liking this place."}
{"text":"Of the three Red Robin locations nearby, this one is probably the least clean, and the least consistent as far as service goes.  It is the closest to home though, but we often opt for Tempe Market Place or the Red Robin out at Chandler Fashion Mall."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Red Robin was probably 10 years ago and I remember liking their onion rings and bottomless fries. I went here last night for a kid's birthday party. Parking was scarce because there's a lot of other restaurants sharing the same lot.

My friend made reservations for our group and we got seated 20 minutes later than our reserved time which gave us time to pick what we want from the menu. We got seated and we've been ready to order but the 2 servers were not and some of us got asked for our orders twice, while the others in our group got completely skipped - lack of communication and coordination.

The servers read our orders back to us and everything was correct. I got the Whiskey River BBQ Burger no tomatoes (since it causes an anaphylactic reaction) with a side of onion rings A few minutes later they came out with our food. They were giving the wrong food to the wrong person. The server called out me food \"Whiskey River Burger no tomatoes with side of onion rings\" so I raised my hand to let them it was mine. And what did I get? A burger with tomatoes and a side of onion rings. I removed it from my burger and want going cause ruckus - I'm not a lawsuit-crazy type of person should I end up in the hospital but that's something they need to be very careful about.

A friend of mine is vegetarian so she ordered a veggie burger. They gave her a lettuce wedgie beef burger with bacon! The whole table waited for her to get the right burger but it never came and we were all famished. We were halfway done so my friend got up and talked to a different server about her order. When she got her food, we were done eating.

We were not offered refills on our drinks. We had to find random servers to get us fry refills. Ketchup bottles were empty. It was just terrible times.

Kids screaming and crying but it is a family restaurant so I can't complain about that."}
{"text":"It pains me to give this such a low rating because it used to be very good, but in the past few months the quality of the service and staff has tanked. We used to go to this location often because it's only 2 miles from our home, but are going the one at Scottsdale 101, which is much further away for us.

We just went tonight for the last time at this location. We were seated at a table that there was still did in the floor in plain sight, slow service, trying to pass a clearly different 1,000 Island dressing as their \"normal dressing\" while the color, texture & taste are different and a manager that lies to your face. Not to mention \"server assistants\" improperly carrying drinks & food when bringing it to the tables.

I actually would be happy if this location was closed and the entire staff was unemployed. The staff at this location don't deserve to be in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"My friend was in from out of town and her daughter was craving burgers - with her love of fries - we decided to head to Red Robin since they have endless fries. Big mistake - we could have gotten better food at McDonalds.

The problems started when we walked in the door.  The hostess asked us to wait while she checked on a table.  While we waited 2 other groups walked in and got seated by other hostess.  Finally one of them asked if we needed a table.  We told them a hostess hadn't returned.  She said \"Yeah she disappears\".  She seated us.

Our table was a mess when we were seated.  My seat had crumbs all over it - as did the table.  No effort was made to clean it off.  We were seated at the tables with the red seats.  Since the bottom of the tables have large round bottoms, the seats do not pull up close to the table.  So the 4 year old with us - was barely at the table.  At one point - she tried to push back and the whole seat went backwards, terrifying her.  Honestly she's lucky she didn't get hurt. Employees watched and walked past - not a single one helped - a couple even laughed!  (We told the manager about this at the end of our visit who said \"well these seats are made for 14 and up\"....then why were we seated there!?!)

My friend ordered her burger medium well.  I ordered mine medium rare.  When we finally got our burgers (Service was incredibly slow for a pretty empty restaurant)  My burger came out - if you can even call it a burger - it was well done.  The burger was smaller/thinner than mcdonalds.  My friends burger - was completely inedible it was burnt to a crisp. Even if you asked for a well done burger - you wouldn't have been able to eat this burger.  We also each had 5 french fries on our plate.  5.  Endless fries and they gave us FIVE.  

We sent my friends burger back.  Then - it came back completely plain.  NOTHING on it - she was paying for a Gourmet burger - it didn't even have cheese.  

The visit was a disaster.  I do not recommend.  Mcdonalds burgers are better and cheaper - just drive down the road and get McDonalds."}
{"text":"Nice burger place to eat at for lunch.   And it's quick service.   You can be in and out within an hour.  

My favorites on the menu consist of the whiskey river bbq burger, mini wedge salad, red's tavern double, 
Whiskey river bbq chicken wrap, freckled lemonade, and their bottomless fries.  

You can't go wrong with eating here.   My food is consistently good.   Yum!"}
{"text":"After several hit-and-miss visits to this Red Robin location we decided to try again with a free Tavern Double burger offer.  Our previous visit in August had been wonderful, with good food and great service, so we figured what the heck.

The visit included me, my daughter, and my wife.  My wife got the chicken and shrimp, my daughter got the poutine fries, I got the free tavern double burger, and we all got a tower of onion rings. 

Our server started out pleasant enough, but after we ordered he essentially disappeared, only checking back once.  I'm not sure when Red Robin decided to stop filling the ketchup containers, but the one on our table was nearly empty, we grabbed the one on the table next to ours and it was almost empty too.

My daughter liked the poutine fries, which were hot and flavorful.  My wife didn't care for her dinner, although hot it was lacking in the flavor department.  My tavern double was also hot, but had absolutely no flavor at all.  Onion rings were perfect. 

Red Robin now utilizes the Zoisk table interface for most features you would have originally used a server for, which I'm not certain is such a great thing.  Upon reviewing the bill I noticed my tavern double hadn't been taken off the bill.  I used the button to call over the server, who explained that once I entered my loyalty number the burger would be removed from the bill, and indeed it was.  Paying through the interface is hassle free, and the ability to leave comments immediately is nice, however I was asked if I'd be interested in the longer survey which would be sent to my e-mail, so far no survey has arrived.  This isn't the first time that Red Robin hasn't seemed interested in the opinion they seem to be seeking.  After my last Yelp, Red Robin Management contacted me wanting my e-mail so we could correspond, but once I sent my e-mail I received no further response.

Longer story short, we went back the very next night, due to a friend having a free birthday burger.  Food quality and service were no better - and again I left a long response via the Zoisk interface and also agreed to a longer survey by e-mail and still haven't received any response by management.  For example, waited at least 10 minutes to have our drink orders taken, being asked if we would like some fries while we wait - 20 minutes later, food comes, and we're still waiting for the fries...the table next to us had been their before we came and we got our food first and this was after almost a 45 minute wait!  I can't see spending good money on mediocre food and service when there are so many better places to spend it."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and the food was good as usually. However this location was very busy and service was very slow. 

It took my food awhile to come out and once the food was on the table it took a little longer to get my campfire (a must try) sauce to come. Although the service was ideal because the food is always on point I'll be back again and hopefully it's not too busy."}
{"text":"Horrible service very dirty restaurant hostess just pushed  everything onto the floor. 4 tables were dirty for approximately 25 min while they had a lot of people waiting in the lobby."}
{"text":"Horrible food... The only reason for the extra star is the great waitress we got... She was spot on for service... Other than that, the food was subpar at best & not worth ever returning... I now see why there are so many negative reviews..."}
{"text":"I like Red Robin. The chain has undergone some serious reconfiguration in the past year or two, but they have retained focus on their burgers. They have many of the same burgers they have been serving for years -- I still like the Royal Red, which is like breakfast on a burger (bacon, egg, cheese), and the Whiskey River BBQ burger is a classic. Some burgers have been phased out, but they have added several burgers featuring high-end ingredients: the \"D.G.B.\" (for \"Darn Good Burger,\"maybe?) features oven-roasted tomatoes, roasted garlic aioli and fresh arugula tossed in citrus olive oil dressing on a toasted ciabatta bun. Fancy! The \"Southern Charm Burger\" even features candied bacon. Yeah, it's worth ordering that one just to get some of that. Believe me!

The menu now offers beverage pairings for some of the burgers.

Service has been consistently friendly, and the servers always make a special effort with my kids, but things can be a little slow when they are full. They have added new touchscreen devices to the tables. These devices can be used to order appetizers and desserts as well as pay the check at the end of your meal. For $1.99, you can unlock a bunch of games to play while you wait, too. That charge just gets tacked onto your bill at the end. 

I would normally give them 4 stars because I like the place, but they get 5 at this location for one reason:

My son left his retainers at the table, hidden in a napkin, and we didn't realize it until we were down the road a bit. We called them as soon as we could, but the table had been cleared. They held the trash can aside for us while we drove back and even helped my family go through the nasty trash in an attempt to locate the missing dental appliances. (If you have never had to dig through trash to do this, believe me you don't want to!)  We ended up finding one of the 2 pieces, which saved us the cost of replacing the entire set, and we really appreciate them helping us out."}
{"text":"Red Robin is a chain restaurant that serves American food.   It's revamped its menu a bunch of times but really the best thing here is the burgers and the garlic fries.   Food is good.  Nothing to write home about but it's better than other chain restaurants similar to this."}
{"text":"Never tried Red Robin before and was completely satisfied with the Teriyaki chicken sandwich!  The endless fries was nice too"}
{"text":"One server can make all the difference in the world. At this Red Robin location it's Shannon D. who rules the roost.

FOOD
- orange cream soda ($3.79) may be priced high, but it's bottomless and comes with whip cream and a cherry or two on top if desired
- guacamole and chips ($7) comes with jalapeños on top, but it's not too spicy. Those can easily be scraped off. Also, additional chips and salsa come out too. Shannon brought our toddlers the extra mild salsa without us even asking. They loved it.
- Whiskey River BBQ chicken wrap ($10.89) - so delicious when it's hot outside as this is a cold wrap. From their website:  \"spinach tortilla, grilled chicken, tangy Whiskey River® BBQ sauce, Cheddar cheese, lettuce, tortilla strips and ranch.\" It was also larger than I anticipated.
- kid's meals ($4.99 + $1.19 for a drink) come with bottomless sides

SERVICE
The best in the Wild West by Shannon (see previously mentioned).

ENVIRONMENT
Typical Americana-decorated Red Robin. Casual. Mostly clean - especially women's restroom at around noon on 6/4/18.

PRICE
The bottomless sides & drinks will definitely have us returning. That's great value. Plus, if our server was an indication of all service at this location, then we are huge fans.

{"text":"Red Robin is hit and miss with my experiences. Sometimes the hamburgers are good and sometimes they are very average. The service also varies, but has been pretty bad the last two times I have been there. The ambiance it casual dining, brightly lit, nothing special. Can be crowded in certain areas. The bar area is nice. They do have video games at the entrance and the hostess staff are always very friendly and helpful. I would recommend the Whiskey River BBQ burger and the A1 Peppercorn burger."}
{"text":"Food was descent and the service was good. The burgers are good here, nothing extra ordinary. I have been to Red Robins a couple times over the past couple years and they are hit and miss with service and food. This time they were on top of it. Quirky, chain ambiance and decor."}

{"text":"Oh Red Robin, where do I start?

It's not going to be with the long wait time and long line to get in -- no, I went on a Saturday night and that's to be expected at the Waterfront.  

It's not going to be about the bar seating where the tables are crammed so closely together that the guy sitting next to us invited himself into our conversation.  (He was really quite friendly although it was a BIT awkward...)

No, no, no.

I'm going to complain about the poor, slow service, the cold food, and the lack of any type of regret or apology on the part of the restaurant staff.  

We found a seat in the bar section of the restaurant and took a seat.  Our waitress took our drink orders promptly and our drinks came fairly quickly.  That's about where anything positive about the experience ended.

We both ordered burgers, nothing fancy, no special orders.

I am aware that it was busy and that this might have slowed things down a bit, but REALLY?  We waited 45 minutes from the time we ordered until our burgers arrived.  Where in the heck does it take 45 minutes to cook a burger and slap it on a bun?  After about 25 minutes, our waitress came by and asked if we needed anything and told us our food would be out soon.  10 minutes later, all of the tables around us (including TWO tables that were seated after we were) had been served and we still had no food. 

My friend finally went and asked a manager what the holdup was and was told that he would look into it.  Another 10 minutes went by and he brought our food to our table (finally).  No explanation about why it took so long.  No apology.

By the time our food came, we were short on time and practically inhaled our burgers.  The burgers were cool and tasteless -- now maybe we felt they were tasteless because we had to eat so fast that it was like we couldn't even enjoy them...   You would expect that after waiting 45 minutes for a burger and fries that the least they could do is serve it warm...

We didn't end up paying for the burgers, they took them off our check after we complained a second time.  But no one apologized, seemed sorry in the slightest.  I would much rather have paid for my burger and had it arrive warm and promptly...

So.  Red Robin, even in the face of a free burger, you still stink.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We go to RR all the time because it's kid-friendly, and we have a kid. Your kid can be a total PITA, and nobody will notice. If they do notice, they'll look over at you with a sympathetic \"doesn't it suck when your kid is being a PITA?\" look.

Also, the service is good. The servers are friendly--although if they are busy, some of them can be slow. (Yes, we mean you, B.) However, if you ever have anything wrong, ask to see a manager, and they will make it right.

Back patio is GORGEOUS. Sitting right on the Mon.

All RRs have some nice dietary options, i.e., You can substitute a Morningstar burger or a Boca burger (neither are GF) for a beef burger. You can get a GF bun or wrap your sandwich in lettuce. I really like the latter option. You can substitute several things for the fries (since they're unlimited, we usually only have one fry order per table and share) for free and a few more things for a small up-charge. Check the menu for deets.

WARNING: The Waterfront gets very busy on the weekends during dinner hours so don't expect to just waltz in there and get a table."}
{"text":"Excellent service! After a soccer game- 17 of us kids/parents came in at 7pm and had seating in less than 3 minutes! The hostess was pleasant and our waitress was ON IT! Everyone enjoyed the food and atmosphere and the burgers were great! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We went for a family lunch on Sunday. The service was good and we all enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"Had dinner with family.  Red Robin does a good job serving a consistent hamburger since I have been at locations in several states.  The server we had seemed impatient when taking the orders.  They have a large board that shows all the beers they have on tap so I ordered one.  As it turns out they discontinued that beer a while back but never changed the board.  Overall Red Robin in a place to go for a good burger but all we god was average service."}
{"text":"Love the good,  love the service.  
Shannon is the best! 
Ask for him,  ask for the onions!  
And ask for a delicious keep it simple with a boca patty.  Yum!"}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times since it's opened in August. Each time, the hosts and servers seem unorganized, slow, and inattentive. The food is fine, though the \"bottomless fries\" just feels like a weird cost-cutting method, because what you get with your entree is minuscule, and you'll never get a second helping because the server will forget. Or maybe that's the plan."}
{"text":"Time after time, terribly slow service. This past visit was definitely my last for quite a while. I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger cooked. It took 40 minutes to get our meals and then the burger might as well have been hockey puck between 2 buns, because it was black and rock hard. If you're going to assume how someone likes their burger cooked... I wouldn't guess \"charred\" would be the correct answer. 

Then we sat with food on our table for another 10 minutes with no one coming by to check on us and no silverware. By the time they finally came over I decided I didn't even want the burger remade because my infant was getting fussy and I didn't want to wait any longer. 

They took my meal off the bill but no other action was taken. You would think, at the very least, a gift card for a free burger or 20% off next time or something. I won't be back any time soon but, given the poor level of customer service, they probably don't care."}
{"text":"The acoustics are gone from here so if you plan on having a conversation you better bring a blow horn. With kids screaming, tables too tightly together, its a wonder there hasn't been an accident. The wait staff says its always congested in the areas where there are tables. The bus boy makes sure to snap the tables down, which makes you jump out of your skin. If you have anxious autistic kids, don't go here, it makes it worse. 36\" is the minimum for a wheel chair to access around tables, through crowded seating sections of any restaurant or retail store, Red Robin has maybe 3\" on a good day.  The decor is so boring, the fun pictures have been moved to a \"strip\" where you have to be seated laying down in order to look at them. The dark colors of the restaurant are ho hum, not happy go lucky at all. It's more like sports bar than anything else. Fries are cold, food is under cooked all the time. Not a good place anymore."}
{"text":"Dissapointed with the food and the service, I ordered the fish and chips, the fish was sour, most likely the batter, french fries were good though, it took more than usual to bring the food, then we waited some time to get the check and leave, don't really know why. She didn't ask if we wanted a refill, which we did, obviously, our server was not very smiling either, it was like she wanted us to eat and get going.
And forgot to say at the entrance we were greeted by the manager I guess, and his stained shirt, not a tiny stain, trust me.
Not a pleasant experience overall."}
{"text":"I really want to give them a 2.5. Just left a meeting nearby and I wanted a chicken salad. I came in around 9:30pm during Game 7 of the World Series and the energy was perfect. The place wasn't super crowded but it took longer than normal to order. Then it took a while to pay.

I ordered a Crispy a chicken Salad with Extra Chicken. They never put enough on so I don't mind paying for extra. Of course my food comes out to go and there is No extra chicken. The bartender says \"Yeah that does look like the normal amount. I'll go handle it for you.\" She come back with a container about 5 minutes later and it's even less Chicken than what came on the salad. I guess I should've asked for Double Chicken. 

But this is still one of my favorite locations. Good environment, clean, and good Customer Service."}

Our server was Jackie or Jessica forget the name honestly but we sat in the bar so she was serving us in the bar excellent waitress, just ordered water nd arrived quickly ... overall it was a good atmosphere they redid the place from the last time we visited lil bit more modernized overall we will be back again."}
{"text":"I recently went to give this place a try. Never did I expect to be seated right away, then simply forgotten.

Ten mins went by and no server to be seen walking by much less approaching any table down the aisle. 

Ten mins was enough wasted time, so I left and walked across the street to a much friendlier restaurant with real service.

Update: 11-21-13
I went back today for a late lunch, of course very few people in the restaurant and service was what one would hope and expect. Why isn't it great service all the time. Many of my friends that I told about the very poor initial service ALL stated to a person that their service us simply MISERABLE but they do like their burgers. 

Food today was OK, not enough for me to return for future poor service during busy times. Too bad their reputation for service is so widely known for being poor."}
{"text":"The service at this location is absolutely terrible. When you finally get your food it's good, but it will take forever to get it. Don't go there hungry because you won't be able to take the wait. I have been their on busy days and slower days and both were terrible."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at Red Robin. Thankfully, my first time here was amazing especially after reading some of the other reviews that was posted on yelp. Service was fantastic and food was awesome. Obviously the burgers were tasty because my little one ate the entire burger. Usually, she will only eat half a burger and say she is done. After the burgers, we decided to try two of their desserts (cinnamon sugar doh rings and chocolate fruffles.) Both are super delicious. The cinnamon sugar doh is a light donut that you can dip into two sauces, caramel or chocolate. The chocolate fruffles is a chilled chocolate covered brownie stick that you can dip in a berry sauce and/or whip cream. This one was my fave.

Sorry, I have no pictures to show. We just dove into the food and finished ... burgers, fries and desserts. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Red Robin on Eastern was really good last night. Our service was wonderful Gary did an amazing job"}
{"text":"They are known for their burgers and that's what I had a hankering for, so my husband brought me here.  There were so many combinations that it was hard to decide.  My husband went for the Whiskey BBQ burger and I tried the Shroom burger.  We both chose the\"some pink\" option, but my burger was very pink.  Since it was also lukewarm and the mushrooms were colder yet, I sent it back.  While I was waiting, the waitress brought me a plate of their bottomless fries. Their fries are perfect - thick cut, perfectly fried, piping hot and nicely salted.  My burger came out nice and hot the second time with hardly any pink, which was just fine.  In the meanwhile I stole a bite of my husband's whiskey bbq and thought it was perfection.  I usually am not a huge fan of bbq on a burger but this was a perfect marriage of tastes.  Too bad I didn't order that one, because the Shroom burger was flat in comparison.  Nice but the mushrooms didn't have much flavor.  I'll be back when I crave a burger again, but I'll have the whiskey bbq next time.  Full speed ahead and damn the calories."}
{"text":"Dude, service people! I drove thirty minutes to place a to go order because not one person was answering the phones, I literally spent 25 minutes on hold and the online ordering wasn't working either. 
My boyfriend and I walk in, after spending 5 minutes waiting up front, we saw two employees who were off the clock leaving, I get it your done you want to go home. But come on! At least greet us. They couldn't even say someone would be right with us. 
Greeting someone shouldn't be part of your job, it's called being a decent human being. 
We walked to the bar area, the guy was super nice greeted us and told us he would be with us soon. If I didn't deal with any of the other BS he would have made this a 5 star review. 
The restaurant wasn't even slammed. The scheduling of the employees must be off because I saw 4-5 employees eating on a break (or just socializing)  and 2 employees leaving."}
{"text":"This establishment closes at 10pm, and when my husband and I walked in at 930 to get dinner the host openly told us that the restaurant would be closing in 30 minutes. The tone in her voice was unwelcoming so I asked, is it okay that we eat? And she took a deep sigh and thought about it! She paused and said, well it's a rush so... So we took our business elsewhere. I have never received such rude service not even a minute into walking through their front doors. Probably the last time we'll visit this location. Super disappointing Red Robins."}
{"text":"I just had the $13.99 plus $1.35 for canned mushrooms French dip. Really, a $15.00 French dip that is so pueney?? Besides being small, it was way too salty!! The mushrooms tasted like they just came right out of the can! I've had waaaaay better AND bigger French dips for $10.00. Not going back because I feel ripped off."}
{"text":"I went to red Robbin and I got macaroni and cheese the waiter came and I sang their song 'Red Robin...yum' and she laughed. I liked their macaroni &cheese a lot."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for here.   The kids loved the environment, but even they complained of the taste of the food.   Service was good, wait it too long on a Friday night..   but do not come here expecting a gourmet burger lol.  Also, Red Robin!! Ore'ida frozen steak fries blow yours out of the water! Get it together Burger guys lol!!"}
{"text":"Came in for my birthday burger, and decided on the garden-burger.  I hadn't tried it before, but I'll be trying it again, many more times.  I may even go vegetarian now that this baby is in my dietetic arsenal.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Visited today 3-2-17 @ 3:00 PM and ordered a simple Bacon  cheddar cheese on Chiba ta bread and a small salad, I was given dirty silverware a salad with brown lettuce and when the Burger came out it had the wrong bread on it, they took the silverware back and brought me a clean set and replaced the salad with a fresh one but it looked like they just scraped off the old salad and remade it on the same plate, not very sanitary, then took back the burger and just changed out the bun instead of remaking a fresh one. For the time of day and only 2 other customers there I was not impressed, I blame management and my server for allowing these things to happen. For the $20.00 I spent I could have gotten 4 sandwiches at a better quality. Don't worry Meatheads you have -0- competition here.
Almost forgot the bottomless fries  are no big deal when they are served cold."}
{"text":"Red Robin is an under appreciated gem. This location has become my emergency lunch spot.  I've had impeccable service, great burgers, and ample refills on my drinks and salad.  I'll do the fries for dinner, but for a quick lunch, a Tavern Double with unlimited salad for $6.99 is tough to beat!  Calling ahead for orders to-go has prevented many lunch free days!"}
{"text":"Saw our waitress once every 25-30 minutes, cold fries and then their credit card system went down.. forcing us to send someone to get cash in order to pay."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened to this place, but the last two times we've been here, the food took forever to get, it was the incorrect food order and it was cold!!! #NotGood #WhatHappened #GetNewManagementPlease"}
{"text":"Beer prices not on the menu so ask or be surprised. 16 oz Stella Artois cost was $7.59. Wow. Never again.

Be aware the device to pay not be for your table. I am not sure how you are supposed to know this, but you could pay for someone else's meal. This takes the wait staff and manager about 20 minutes to remedy.

Meal not worth the cost. I had the Maro Polo chicken sandwich. The sauce was supposed to be \"roasted tomato aioli\" made with sun dried tomatoes. Tasted like garlic and more garlic. Chicken very tough. Fries come with any other side cost extra and you don't get the free fries.

Wait staff confused when my spouse only ordered a bowl of soup for dinner.

When the hostess lead us to the table the table was clean, however the seats were filled with leftover food."}
{"text":"Great new location in the Pavilions.  The bar is 21 and up only so you don't have to watch your P's and Q's so much (big fan of this).  Decent beer selection.   What made it was the bartender (sorry man, your name slips my mind).  But you had all batman bartending gear, which was awesome.  He was friendly, knowledgeable,  and fast service.  Will definitely be back.  This is one of the better RR locations."}
{"text":"Bottomless fries, strawberry lemonade, and fruit salad. sure why not?
I haven't gone to Red Robin for over three years and I finally decided to come back again.  

Food (3)
I ordered the Whiskey River, BBQ Chicken wrap a few weeks ago. I was pretty excited to try this entree and it was okay.  I wish there was a little more sauce in it and the wrap was really dry and hard.  It didn't taste fresh like it should be. 

In addition I tried a Baja-Turkey sandwich Club. Please do NOT order this. It tasted horrible, the sauce that they mixed with the sandwich did not compliment the turkey club the way it should be.  I was hungry, so I kept eating it.  However, the more I ate it the more the sandwich started to taste gross and the sauce makes the bread pretty soggy. 

Drinks: (3)
I ordered the Bourbon Honey Lemonade, mmmh it reminds of something that you should drink if you have a cold or sore throat. It was o-k, but not something I would ever order again. 

Service (4)
All the hostess and waiters/ess were all very friendly and super easy going.  Very attentive and they did a great job serving all the customers that they had in their restaurant. 

Overall (3)
Though the service was great and amazing, the food really lacks."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and the service was so SLOW! It was as if it was so busy, but it wasn't. There were a lot of empty tables and now I know why now.
Our food took forever to come out and it was just the two of us. 
The food wasn't even hot when I got it, but I didn't want to wait any longer so I dealt with it. 

We asked THREE times to get a order of their bottomless fries before we actually got one. I was so annoyed and I'm never going back."}
{"text":"A Haiku For Red Robin

Lovely summer day.
Hairy, burnt food took an hour.
I will never be back."}
{"text":"There must have been a time when you have felt ravenous and want to devour everything within sight. Red Robin is the epitome of this desire. With their ginormous burgers and bottomless baskets of fries, you will feel satisfied and ready for the self hatred that comes with it. 

Walking past the first set of double doors, you will be greeted with a warm welcome and open second set of double doors. The hostess inquire about your day and lead you to your table. The interior is strictly classic American. It does not pretend to be a 50's diner, but gives you the feel of what I guess our country use to be. 

The food is over abundant and fast. I normally prefer the whiskey river BBQ burger on a whole wheat bun. When I substitute the meat patty for a boca burger, I am still not disappointed. The last time I ordered their new menu item, the chophouse burger. It is delicious, but I felt my arteries clogging up. Overall, I enjoyed it, but do not remember everything that was on it besides the onion straws and the horseradish mayo. I think there was some sauteed mushrooms as well. It was tasty, but I would order my usual.

There are so many different tiers in the Vegas burger world. For being a family establishment that is unassuming and basic, I enjoy this for when I want something simple or classic. 

The best part about this location, if you don't despise your weak will, you can always walk over to the Cupcakery for the K.O."}
{"text":"For a chain place, I gotta say, they are pretty good...I believe places like TGIF and Appleby's have been going downhill.
We were both needing to eat something, but at the same time, we didn't want to pig out. I was game for whatever. Red Robin was right there on our way to the car.
Staff was friendly and efficient, place was clean, decor was nice.
I've never had anything other than a burger at a Red Robin. We decided to share the Whiskey River® BBQ Chicken Wrap with bottomless steak fries. I'm picky about BBQ sauce, so I was worried, but this was so good, food tasted fresh, it was the perfect melding of flavors. I was happy, I would get it again.
I love when a restaurant splits the meal onto two separate plates when they know it'll be shared. Good job guys."}
{"text":"We usually eat at he Red Robin over in the Galleria Mall, but we decided to try this one this time. We were seated quickly but it took some time for us to be waited on, the restaurant was busy so I let this pass. My husband got a Big Tavern Burger Pig Out Style and I got the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap, both with their bottomless fries. The food just wasn't as good as the other location. Service ended up getting better but I think I will skip this location if we go to a Red Robin again."}
{"text":"It's a good place to bring the kids for some average bar food in a fun setting and decent hamburgers. Don't expect anything amazing. It's just a sit down Burger chain."}
{"text":"We had a great time here. Really enjoy the bottomless fries, the Whiskey BBQ burger, food quality and customer service. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Very happy with the food overall and price. I have had the A.1 peppercorn as well as the blue burger and many others. All good food and endless fries make it an endless treat."}
{"text":"This location is the best Red Robin I've ever been to. The building seemed new so everything was clean and bright. The staff was friendly and the burgers came out hot and fast. Great place for a burger!"}
{"text":"We sat at a table that the booth seat was broken and the young kid that seated us, was a dork and he really didn't understand good customer service.  So when I told him the seat was broken, he just smile and said we can move over a little bit and now we were sitting with the table next to us. 

Not a enjoyable experience, my wife had the turkey burger , it was really chewy not good, I had the chicken breast sandwich, it was ok nothing to write home to mom about!

Our server Ray is the only reason I gave them three stars.  He did a good job!"}
{"text":"I've only been here 3 times every time I come I get highly disappointed. They close at 10 I get there at 8:45 and everybody's always concerned about going home as opposed to serving the customer. The bar area was a mess nowhere to sit and I asked can I sit down in the bartender goes sure sit anywhere but there was no area clean on the bar towels in the trash cans towels on the table and nobody in the restaurant. There were only 5 people in the bar area at the time. I even took pictures of towels in the trash can and towels on the tables."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in and there was a sign that stated open seating. We grabbed a both where someone could see us. Wasn't helped for about 10 mins. We walked up front so someone would come up front help us out. Servers walked by smiled at us, the manager looked at us and we still didn't get helped. There was about 5 tables in both the bar and the dining room. Horrible experience I don't recommend coming to this location absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"Big, I mean BIG, burgers and a jumping atmosphere.  That is what you are getting and that is what you are paying for.  That and the endless french fries.  Big ol' steak fries that never stop coming.  It is the American heart attack dream come true.  Only three stars though because it really didn't have a personality of its own.  Yes, you can customize any burger with any toppings or buns but... The place looks like 1950-present decor thrown up all over the walls. I would definitely classify the place as \"A-OK\" and would go back.. Just not going to go out of my way to make sure I work it into the routine or anything.  

But seriously, if you want a kick butt no nonsense burger, endless fries, and a variety of really cool drinks.  Then Red Robin is your place.  

Enjoy,

-Ian M."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries at this place. The service was pretty good, nothing to write home about, but not poor by any means."}
{"text":"Had a bit of a hiatus from writing reviews.  Needed to clear my head a bit because as you know this is very important and soul crushing work.  Well so begins review-a-thon 2012!

I've been to this Red Robin several times over the years, back in the day it was a regular stop on Galleria Mall shopping trips.  Since the Internet has nearly completely taken over my life and I don't have a need for such a thing as a \"shopping mall\" I rarely find myself there anymore.  Somehow, someway it's become a meeting place for a group of friends of mine lately when we've all been in that area, so here goes:

I've got to say that years ago Red Robin was probably my favorite Burger joint in Las Vegas with the exception of In N Out.   At that point all that I really knew was fast food burgers, so RR was always a breath of fresh air from those.   Well times have changed, and much like my Motorola RAZR in comparison to my iPhone, RR's burgers have taken a backseat to newer, sexier models of burger that I can get from places like Bachi, Fuku, or one of the 50 burger places that opened in the last 12 hours.  

That being said, Robin still puts out a decent quality product for my money.  The beer is cold, the ingredients usually taste fresh, service is generally friendly and I'd be remiss not to mention the bottomless steak fries that you get with every order.  My favorite is probably the Burnin Love because jalapenos and burgers are one of my preferred combinations.  

Ultimately I wouldn't recommend seeking out a Red Robin if you're craving a burger and are near one of the Bachi locations or even an In N Out, but if you find yourself trapped in the Build a Bear Workshop, Hot Topic, Abercrombie and Fitch or some other shopping mall clone at the Galleria one day and you don't feel like Sbarro, Red Robin might be worth a go."}
{"text":"We came in at 5pm on a weekday the place was EMPTY. 

The host was a teenage girl who you could tell was not the least bit interested in doing her job. Dragged her feet and moaned and groaned about seating us. 

After we were seated we were given menus and told our waitress would be over soon. Well, TWENTY (20) MINUTES later and still no waitress. There were only 2 other tables. Several waiters saw us, made eye contact, looked over at us, but none came to wait on us. We were about to get up and leave when finally a waitress came over and took our order.

As for the food... ordered burgers medium rare they came well done. 

Won't be back. Terrible service. Food not worth the price."}
{"text":"We were out celebrating my daughters 10th birthday and she requested Red Robin for dinner. Because we knew they closed at 10 and we were arriving at 9:30 I left the family in the car and came in to ask if we could still dine there. I walked in the door at 9:30 and it took a few minutes to be greeted. When two people came up to me, I told them that we wanted to come in to eat, that we would eat fast, would that be okay. The lady said that they close in 15 minutes, which I questioned because we were still about 25 minutes from closing. She said with an attitude that if we came in they'd have no option but to serve us. I said I didn't want to make anyone mad and she went on to say that she can't stop us from coming in but she can't guarantee the cooks won't be mad. We opted to leave with that attitude from the staff. We were a party of ten (3 adults/7 kids) that would've ordered and eaten quickly, ended up with a large bill and tipped well."}
{"text":"The usual nice clean restaurant.  A decent menu and fast service.  We were on a tight schedule and they made every effort to make our lunch great."}
{"text":"This is probably the third time I have tried this same restaurant over the course of 3 years and it still hasn't gotten any better. The chophouse burger was forgettable. The mushrooms and onion strings were a welcome accompaniment but still doesn't resurrect the overcooked tasteless beef patty.  My friend had a burger with pepper jack cheese and commented he didn't even know that it was pepper jack since the flavor was so bland. It seems to me that if you're going to overpay for burgers, at least they should taste like something! Our server was friendly and attentive, so that's the only reason it gets 2 stars."}
{"text":"So my wife choose Red Robin for a B-day dinner. I asked the waitress if she could turn down the A/C. She said no! She said corporate controls it. Really!! It's like an ice burg in here!"}
{"text":"I give this a four because of how slow the service was. My boyfriend and I got seated quickly and were able to order our food thanks to Mary. But she wasn't so good at coming to see if we were okay and the thing that lets us pay, didn't have any receipt paper but overall, it was a pretty great and the food were amazing"}
{"text":"Continues to be a great place for lunch or dinner. There service every time I have been there is quick, fries are fresh and usually meets expectations. The server this last time was new, so I will give her grace for not filling our water glass fast enough or knowing what protein style was. I do however encourage any server there new or old to always keep the drinks filled. Its usually the first thing customers notice when dining. we'll return!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of red robin as a whole, primarily because of the lemonade and the fries. This has been a go to place for us during the last trimester. I was very excited to find this location next to the hospital. Wahoo! Anyways, the service was overall good. It was much busier then other locations we have gone but I think overall the team did there best. We would return to this location."}
{"text":"This review is specifically about the service. The food was good as normal since it is of course a Red Robin. The front hostess was extremely rude and disrespectful. She was talking with us about how many and booth or table. As she gathers the menus and starts to walk, she stops, turns around and answers the phone putting her back to us. She needs to be taught how rude this is. Either ignore the phone or ask the person in the phone to hold and or ask us in line to wait a moment. So rude! Once we got to our table, we sat there for at least 5-8 minutes before the hostess came over and asked if our server had been there yet. After saying no, she offered to get our drinks which we stated water was fine and we asked to put our order in quickly since we were in a rush. She did go and get our server, so high five to her for that. I wish the service would have gotten better. Our server came over, took our order and also confirmed we only wanted water. I don't know where our water came from, but it sure took way to long for just water. Our fries were served and gone, he looked over at our table from the kitchen area at least twice, estimated at least 15 or more minutes before 2 waters arrived at the table. Wow! Who would have thought 2 waters took that long to prepare. If they were waiting for the ice to freeze I could have told them to hold the ice since the entire glass was filled with ice when it arrived. I do give the server a high five for coming back over twice asking to refuel our water. I do though recommend he takes heed and after someone has said nope were fine with water for the 3rd time to stop offering us alcohol. Specially to the 8 month pregnant women. Our table was in the perfect location to be able to see the kitchen and the food get ready. The restaurant was not busy and I thought I saw our food placed on top ready to serve. Our server got a tray ready twice, moved one of our plates once to and from the tray and finally 10 mins later after another server was pulling out plates did he finally get them and bring them to us. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed in the service. We had to ask for to go boxes when our food arrived because the server was not on his game and we didn't have the hour and half that may be use to. The service needs improvement!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. My waitress was extremely friendly and despite them being busy, she was constantly checking in on me. The bbq chicken sandwich is by far my favorite (also great as a wrap)! And they have Angry Orchard on tap.. Yes please and thank you!!"}
{"text":"We love this location! Have been coming here a lot lately. Usually switch it up a bit and get one of their cheeseburgs. Personally I like the royal burger with the sunny side up egg :) we always sit at the bar and always get good service there every time. Also have gotten the cheeseburg with caramelized bacon and sautéed onions on it which is amazing!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to a Red Robin so I was surprised when they started serving their burgers on a red plate and putting their fries in a tiny metal circle. Looked like they were giving us less. 

Came here around 3pm so it wasn't too busy. Was seated instantly. Ordered a Sam Adams and a Royal egg burger. Burger tasted fine and so did the fries, but I just missed the burger and fries in a basket presentation. What I did like was the tables have these touch screen computers where you can place an order and even pay your bill without bothering the server. Big plus if you're in a hurry. Would definitely back again."}
{"text":"This is the last time I'm coming to this location. I thought maybe after my last bad service visit that I would give it a go. I asked to sit outside and they didn't have a server for us. waited ten minutes and had ask the people on break to get some one, the patio was littered with trash on the tables just sitting there. I like red robin but not this location. Customer lost."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, but what made this lunch experience exceptional was our server, Harrison. He greeted us as we entered and sat us at a table we requested. When we realized the table location was unacceptable, Harrison immediately reseated us. He took care of us throughout our lunch. He provided additional plates without asking. We left Red Robin with the best feeling we have had with service at a restaurant. Harrison was terrific and made our dining experience one of our best ever."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night and I thought it was going to take a lot longer to be seated than it did. I would say it took less than 10 minutes to be seated. The location of our table was not the best, but I guess someone had to sit there. Our server was right there to take our drink orders and she returned in a few minutes with them. Gave us enough time to decide on what we wanted and if I was given anymore time, I would have changed my mind again. I think between our drinks getting there until us ordering our food, I changed what I wanted to eat 4 or 5 different times. I decided on the fish sandwich. The sandwich was ok, but the great thing is the endless fries. I have an addiction to fries.  There was nothing fantastic about the sandwich, but I could watch a little baseball, enjoy the company I was with, and eat some bottomless fries. Overall, it was a win for me."}
{"text":"My wife and I very much enjoyed our dinner last night. Don, the bartender, was fantastic! Great job!

I like the new interior, but I don't know anyone who likes the seating arrangements in the lounge/bar area. Bring back the booths!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 11:30 with four people and were promptly greeted by Taylor who was very nice. Drinks came quick, then we ordered. I asked for a basket of fries and she said sure, no problem.

We were busy talking and having a good time so it was at least 15 minutes before I thought about the fries, let alone our meal. I stopped the hostess as she walked by and asked her if RR still does free fries. She said yes, but only after someone orders. I told her we had already placed our order about 15 minutes ago and she said sorry and took off toward the kitchen. Within 20 seconds the manager stopped by with fries, apologized, and gave us silverware. He was very nice and I said it was no big deal at all. 

Our food arrived about five minutes later, and everything was great, except the onion rings I ordered were overcooked and kinda greasy. Our sever stopped by a few more times but she was completely rude after the fry thing. I really like Red Robin and I know this was just a one-off deal, but it was more than a little off putting on how rude she was. So she forgot our fries, our silverware, let dishes pile up on our table and she was rude about it. lol She's young and I'm sure they'll coach her. RR is still my favorite chain burger joint."}
{"text":"I go to Red Robin a few times a year. The food is excellent and how can you beat unlimited French fries? The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the service. It's SLOW everytime I've been there service is SLOW.  If you're with a group of friends (that all like each other) then it's not that bad because you can sit and talk over drinks from the bar. But I've tried to come here on my lunch break from work before (I get an hour lunch) and I was late getting back to work."}
{"text":"Waaaay better service than the one in Centennial!!!!  Waitress even offered up the free fries while we waited for our food! Unlike centennial where they seem insulted that you even ask or you're lucky to even get it.  I had turkey burger shroom no bun sub fries for soup....kiddie got the pizza....overall satisfied and really enjoyed our lunch! Thanks for this location not having the awful service that centennial has! If you all communicate maybe you should train those servers there on how to service customers."}
{"text":"Wow...so I haven't been to this location in a while.  And I am disappointed that service is worse!!! They also changed their menu which just
got more confusing.  Ugh overall this location just sucks! Management you need to coach your staff on upping their customer service!  That and try to smile and treat kids under 5 with more compassion.  You may also want to coach your staff on cleanliness...you had a server sneeze, wipe her nose on her wrist then grab food at the window...yuck!"}
{"text":"It was my first time going to Red Robin with friends. I thought the staff was friendly, helpful and attentive. Dennis, our server did a great job. The menu is quite extensive and offers something for everyone. The burgers aren't cheap but I thought the quality was quite good. I ordered the Marco Pollo chicken sandwich which came with arugula and peppered bacon and I thought it was very tasty.

The place was packed on a Saturday evening at about 6 pm and I have no complaints for my first visit to Red Robin."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The service was terrible ordered appetizer didn't come until after crappy overpriced burgers. Never got a refill on water or ice tea.Not sure why so many people take their kids to a bar/restaurant. Thought I was at Chucky Cheese."}
{"text":"I have always loved this Red Robin's location. They recently updated the interior, which makes it seem even more inviting. Last night, we visited to celebrate my Dad's birthday. After some confusion by the woman at the front, we were quickly seated. I really appreciated that they removed a chair so my grandma's wheelchair could fit in place of the chair. It's the little things.

Since we are regulars, we ordered as soon as our waiter came over. Our waiter was Marquese (I hope I spelled that right!) and he was super awesome, funny, and just a great guy. I asked him about the dairy free options since their online allergen menu was finicky, and he was able to answer all my questions. He took our orders back, and was quick to let us know that the kitchen was out of one of the items we ordered, but we picked something else. And, when we finished eating, they brought my dad an ice cream and sang to him! It seems silly, but I really wanted to make sure they acknowledged his birthday for him. Like I said, it's the little things.

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I absolutely hate the stupid tablets on the table.  For some reason, we had 3 on our table when we sat down, and we moved the other two away without realized that they were all registered to different tables. So when it came time to pay the bill, we sat around waiting because our little tablet never lit up, because it was on someone else's table. I wish the waiters would either teach us how to use it, or just do it for us. I haven't been back here since before they started using the tablets, so I was lost when it came time to order and pay. I also dislike that their online allergen menu is wonky. I know this isn't a problem specific to this Red Robin, and luckily our waiter was knowledgeable about allergens, but I would hate to go back and get a waiter that didn't know. I just hope this review gets passed on to the people that can change this information.

Overall, this is a great location to visit and I will definitely be back. Hopefully I learn how to use the tablet by then!"}
{"text":"We were a party of three that arrived at 9:30pm on a day they close at 11:00pm. It was a slow evening and we only saw our waitress three times.  Once to order, once to refill our fries and to give us our check.  The runner that served our food literally threw our food on the table and almost spilled the hot plate on my lap. They only brought two plates with our appetizers then asked us if we needed a third plate for three people.  The food was so horrible that could not eat my sandwich and requested a refill of fries but the waitress didn't care enough to ask us how our food was and only threw down the basket of fries on the table.  I don't recommend this place to anyone.  Worst place in town."}
{"text":"We haven't been to Red Robin in several years. It will be several more years before we go back.  It has nothing to do with the service, it has everything to do with the food.  We both ordered one of there Gourmet burgers, one Chophouse and the Blue burger. Over priced and undersized!
 A gourmet burger joint should sell hand pattied, thick juicy burgers.  These burgers are frozen 1/4\" thick burgers.  Yes the burger looks huge when you get it because the bun is filled with toppings.  Reminds me of the old commercial \"Where's the Beef?\" and fries were nothing special, frozen steak fries and a very small portion at that.
The best burgers in Goodyear are served at the Haymaker on Litchfiled Rd, just north of Mc Dowell.  This is not a chain....and the food is wonderful!  Price wise I do believe it's cheaper and much tastier! Great fries too!"}
{"text":"I came here with my reptilian blooded wife because she was cold and didn't want to go outside of the mall to eat somewhere after shopping. This place is OK if you want convenience in the mall and if you keep your expectations low. I've got no problem with the burgers, but you're rolling the dice with service.

After a five minute wait to be sat on a Saturday night around 7 PM, we had about a five minute greet after being sat in the bar area and the service seemed to be a step behind for the rest of the meal especially with order delivery and refills. The burger selection, which they group into three categories, is actually pretty large: gourmet, finest, and tavern. There are also salads, $3, $5, $7, and $9 apps, chicken entrees, and soups.

We kept it pretty simple ordering the Tavern Double for my wife, the Sautéed Shroom burger for me, and sharing regular fries. I can't complain about my burger, ordering with pink, it was juicy with healthy serving of mushrooms and melted Swiss cheese on the burger. The fries were sufficient. I have had most of the gourmet burgers and they're all good depending if you have a craving. The Chili Chili Cheeseburger is a combination on a burger that I like that is isn't offered in a lot of places.

I swiped my credit card at the table and paid. After I asked my wife if she wanted me to pull the car around to pick her up, she declined and braved the 47 degree weather trek in the tundra to the  car. I see us coming back as a tertiary option or if we want a burger and don't want to leave the mall."}
{"text":"It's a Red Robin...typical chain restaurant.  On a Saturday night in the Waterfront area, this was the only restaurant with less than a 2 hour wait.  I was a bit weary of that fact, but we were seated within 20 min and the service was great.  
They just added a few menu items and their happy hour prices are CHEAP!!!!  I loved the new shrimp taco's and with a Blue Moon - I was happy!"}
{"text":"Door dash delivery cold fries no ketchup no silverware  very dissatisfied will never do doir dash again from here delivery guy didnt know where our building was"}
{"text":"Well , it started off good .. my food was warm and pretty good . I guess they have all you can eat fries .. not sure because my waitress never did come back . I guess I need to use the techno device on the table if I need anything, like water ??? Or ketchup?  :((   Tried to use a coupon . I guess I was a penny short from using it . Really ... ugh . They did give me 2.00 off . Thank you ..... but I prob won't go back . Have not been to a Red Robin in many years . This experience definitely won't bring me back .."}
{"text":"This location gets 4 stars IF you eat inside at the bar. Last week we ordered to go, which is not worth the money or the time. The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because Eric the manager comped the meal after I called in freaking out. First off you used I be able to order a side of fries for free (because they are bottomless) however they don't do that anymore so you have to pay 2 bucks more... With that two bucks you will get 11 fries, well that's what we got anyway. But what got me the most was that I specifically asked for my burger to be well done.... The thing was mooing. Oh man it was so gross! I have included pictures because it was just that bad. I know it's a chain and let's face it... Sometimes chains just don't have the best food but really... I would have been better off with mcdonalds at a 3rd of the cost!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in Charlotte! Everything I have ordered is excellent. They also have delicious milkshakes."}
{"text":"Food is always good, But staff doesn't care about customer experience just about getting their job done. The male host who wears glasses and wearing a bling tie should not be a host if he can't deal with people minus the attitude and faces he makes. Moses is our server and is doing a great job! Place looks great but please retrain on atmosphere for customers."}
{"text":"the last several times i have been to this location I was not impressed to say the least. the most recent experience was bad enough for me not to go back. the waiter only came by our table maybe a total of 3 times and he brought the appetizer before he brought any napkins or silverware and when he finally did bring the silverware he brought 1 napkin for 2 people!! I asked for napkins twice and he never returned so had to holler at the hostess for her to please bring us some extra napkins. The food wasnt the greatest on this visit either and we were never offered any of the bottomless fries. we only got a few fries with the sandwhich. Not once were we checked on to see if we needed anything and my friend didnt get a refill on her drink the entire meal!"}
{"text":"I just had an amazing burger at this establishment.  I ordered the Smoke & Pepper burger. It was incredible.  I think I paid about $13 for it and man was it money well spent.  My wife ordered some sort of chicken sandwich and she loved it.  

The restaurant had a great layout and it was really clean.  The servers couldn't have been nicer.  I highly recommend this place.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been hearing commercials about Red Robin for years, and I have never gone into one until a month or so ago.  Quite honestly, I expected more.  I think their only saving grace is the tower of onion rings, which were tasty, but they weren't worth the price they charge.  My fiance and I ordered our burgers, which definitely were NOT worth the price they charge for them.  Their burgers are flavor-less, and mine was not medium to medium-well cooked as I had asked (it was more along the lines of medium rare....far too pink for my taste).  I know what you're thinking:  did you send it back?  The answer is no, because I didn't want someone to spit in my food for having to re-make it.  When I got the bill, it was almost $50......for two burgers, a tower of onion rings, and two sodas.  I have to be honest, I can get a better burger at In-N-Out, spend far less money, and be completely satisfied.  Want another example of where you can get better burgers?  SmashBurger, Burger King, and Lenny's.  

I definitely will not be coming back to this location, or any of the other ones for that matter.  I even filled out a comment card, someone said they were going to call, but they never did.  I would have given them less than one star, but unfortunately, Yelp doesn't go down that far.  Red Robin, how you are able to stay in business is beyond me.....perhaps it's your booze....who knows....."}
{"text":"we decided to sit at the bar in hopes that a booth would open up in the bar.  a booth opened up and we grabbed it!  i was so pleased it did because the bartender was totally ignoring us because he was busy talking with a couple about nothing and he didn't even offer us menus. 

once we moved to the the booth, all was fine and the server was nice enough.  she refilled out water and took our order quickly. we both ordered the california chicken sandwich and it comes with those delicious fries red robins are known for. the food was tasty but don't think i would return to this location because it is not close to me. overall it's an A-OK place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Our experience was at the bar :$
One bartender with 20 people on there doesn't cut it!
Waited too long for service then he/she got distracted by people at the actual bar so we even waited longer to order.
Burning love burger was dry no salsa like it supposed to be.
Fries were burned oily and crumbled
Before we left bathroom (men) was too filthy to use.
Last two years went to red robin few times a month never had a bad experience
This one discussed me"}
{"text":"I don't like writing negative reviews, but my wife had a great point. These restaurants need the reviews so they can improve on their weaknesses. 

I will first start with the hostess. She was friendly and professional, but when we asked to be seated at a booth, we were placed in a completely packed area. Everybody in the restaurant was all seated in the same spot. There were many open seats available, but for what I assumed was convenience to the waitress we were all packed in like sardines. I finally asked my waitress if we could move to another part of the dining area.

We ordered an appetizer of onion rings. When the girl brought our onion rings she set two plates on the table and one of them had some type of red substance on the edge of it. I set the dish outside and moved on. The substance was still wet by the way. I didn't want to risk getting sick. Maybe it was old ketchup or maybe blood, haha kidding, but maybe. 

Our waitress was polite and did her job as usual. During our meal we had a few dirty plates and sauce containers that we needed removed from the table. The busboy approached the table multiple times asking if we needed anything. He even touched the dirty dish for some reason and then let it go and walk away. The dishes were obviously stacked for removal and sitting at a small table that should have been addressed.  I think if the customer has to ask for dirty dishes to be removed from the table it puts them in an awkward position.

Moving on from that, I ate my pink in the middle burger and then asked for the check. I had ordered my burger well done or at least with no pink. I did not want to cause any more static for this waitstaff. I just wanted to leave at that point.  

The waitress then brought out my bill. Wow, every time I come to this restaurant I always tell myself never again. I paid $40 for two people to eat. Two burgers,two drinks, and one stack of onion rings-40 dollars. I know it's not cheap to provide quality food these days. Food prices have risen in the past few years, but, this is ridiculous. My wife and I were doing the math during the car ride home and figured the onion rings cost $10.

So like I said, I don't like doing negative reviews but this had to be said. Red Robin charges a huge amount of money for a low quality product in my opinion. I don't think I will be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"So went in today to have lunch with some friends and as usual, this location was really busy. When we walked in we were told it was an hour wait. However the wait was only 30 min and very reasonable due to today being the last day of school do the local school district so a lot folks out celebrating. 

Once we were seated, the hostess was very kind and explained basics to us (who our server is, you need anything, etc. ect.). It didn't seem to take long for our server to get our drink order as well as our food order. Again, the restaurant was slammed!!!, and thou you could see it, the staff did a great job at being attentive to their responsibilities.

One concern we had was our food would get cold waiting, but that did not happen. When the pay tablet didn't work, the manager was quick to help us out.

In Conclusion, I know I didn't mention much about the food as I believe its well known, however, I believe that the service was some of the best I have experienced in some time at this restaurant and was really impressed."}
{"text":"Meh is right. This place is way overpriced for the food you get, and service is never very good. Which is slightly understandable since EVERY time I go here, no matter when or why, it is packed. I hadn't been here since high school, when I didn't care about anything but eating junk and hanging out with my friends in the few places that teens could go to. It's a great place for that, for when you are a kid and have money to burn on low end food.
The biggest gimmick they have is their 'types' of burgers. It seems that they have a mass amount of patties in the back, all the same, but they throw different things on top and call them gourmet burgers. For 10$ or more each. Yeah, you get 'bottomless fries' (which are, hilariously, in an actual bottomless cylinder) but that is only if your waiter/waitress is around to notice you want/need more. They give you a hand full of tasteless steak fries. How can one make fries so bland? There is a reason they give every table a giant shaker of seasoning. 
I got a Gardenburger. Which is, a Gardenburger you can buy at the store. They also serve the vegan Boca patty...also bought at the store. You can sub any veggie patty for any type of burger, but really, it doesn't make a difference."}
{"text":"Probably the worst waiter in the history of time. He sucked harder than a hungry Jew in Auschwitz. Standard Red Robin food. Mediocre atmosphere. Dog shit service... I'm sitting here at the table eagerly awaiting my check so I don't have to deal with people that suck so badly at their mediocre meaningless jobs... I wish I had 2 more hands to give more thumbs down.."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was awesome, and Nick is a blessing to servers everywhere. The other two who helped us were kind as heck and in the ball! Overall great experience 10/10 would do again."}
{"text":"Today's visit was met with great service from Angie and delicious food. A simple burger, bottomless fries and a Samuel Adams just hit the spot!  If you're in the mood for a good burger, I would definitely recommend Red Robin."}
{"text":"I need to preface this by saying that as a general rule I avoid chain restaurants.  I'm not opposed to them in theory or anything, I just tend to enjoy the experience of an unaffiliated establishment more often then not.  That being said, I have been to a number of Red Robin locations at various times, and I have rarely been unhappy with the experience.  Yes, the walls are covered with eyesore. Yes, the noise level approaches deafening levels, (especially on weekend evenings).  Yes, you won't be finding any groundbreaking culinary delights. What you will find is very good tasting burgers and sandwiches that are consistently well-prepared, service that is consistently good to very good, all at very reasonable prices.  I have tried a great number of the burger items on the menu and would recommend any of them, pick one that suits your taste.  I do remember the bruschetta burger being overly garlicky, but still good.  The bottomless steak fries are a nice touch too."}
{"text":"This place is great for consistency. The food is pretty good, but not overly stellar. The service is so-so, we've had some great servers, and some pretty crappy ones. 

Sometimes you just need some fries and campfire sauce :) -- If you haven't had this stuff yet, do it. It will change your life. 

Great for family dinners or dining with a mixed crowd. Good selection of burgers, salads, chicken burgers, and other tasty options. I'm also a pretty big fan of their specialty drinks, but sometimes they can go terribly wrong. 

Favorite dishes include: Whisky river BBQ burger (the chicken version is pretty good too - both are delicious when lettuce wrapped), Clam Chowder, fries, garlic fries, sweet potato fries, mango margaritas, and the mud pie."}
{"text":"Doesn't live up to the hype...  This was my first visit to a Red Robin (business lunch). We arrived about 12:45, and obviously the lunch rush was over.  Dining room was not even a quarter full.  But the tables were dirty, the hostess could not seem to figure out where to seat us, and it took forever for a server to come over and greet us. The food itself was ok at best.   The top bun was cold, and the bottom was soggy.   I cannot remember the name of the burger, it was being promoted--\"Fire\" something.   No fire at all!  Very bland.  And their claim of bottomless fries is a joke.  You get maybe 10 steak fries, and be prepared for a 5-10 minute wait to get another 10 fries.   Our server was very polite.  I won't be back"}
{"text":"We usually avoid chain restaurants but we make an exception to go have the chicken tender salad at RR.  Service was not the best but we were expecting it. Perhaps they should reduce the door greeters from 3 to 1 and have more servers checking on the food orders and drink levels.

We ordered the chicken salad and the river burger. Both were ok for the type of restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has gone to the dogs. The food is just not good anymore service is crap the entire place has turned into a children's restaurant. Save your money go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try a Red Robin, since we've never been.  The hostess greeted us and informed us that our wait would be 5 minutes.  15 minutes later, she finally seats us.  The first thing I noticed was the restaurant wasn't busy...hmmm.

Our server was very nice, we ordered our burgers.  She asked if I wanted my burger with pink or without pink inside the burger.  I informed her, I do not want pink in my burger.  However,  I received a burger that had a little pink in it.  I also ordered the garlic fries, which was \"ok\".  We only ordered water with lemon as our beverages.  We needed to ask for refills, our waitress was nice but she wasn't very attentive.  We asked for more fries, another waitress brought me regular fries (I ordered garlic).  They were apologetic,  but my experience was not the best experience at Red Robin.  All in all...it was 2 1/2 stars but I couldn't put half a star and I wasn't comfortable giving it 3 stars.  Hopefully when I eat here again, I'll give it more stars...but I wouldn't wait for an update anytime soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I just left this place. Unbelievably filthy! They seated us at a table that had burger sauce on it and pieces of bread on the seat. I was disgusted. What made us get up and leave was the sections of tissues and fries left on the floor. I've been to a few McDonalds' that were cleaner than this. In search of a new burger joint."}
{"text":"My wife and I love going to Red Robin's across the city and have even been to some locations in Socal, but this locations kitchen is very inconsistent. We have been to this one the most because we like the location (although we live in North Las Vegas)

Staff - 5
Venue - 5
Kitchen - 3

We tried their new Poutine Fries that was on the menu this time.  It came out fast, within 5 minutes of the waitress putting the order in on their fancy ipad looking thing.  I was shocked the gravy that came out with the fries were room temperature and the fries were less than warm.  This made the whole dish lukewarm at best.  It still had great flavor, but I can only imagine how good it would of been if it came out hot and fresh.  My wife ordered her burger \"No Pink\" and most of it was cooked alright, but one side of it was almost as red as the tomato that was on her burger.  After we were able to let someone know of the issue they were more than happy to prep us a new burger and remove the cost without us even asking."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte, I'd hear about Red Robin but there are none in Miami so I decided to check it out.  It's a cool little spot to get a tasty burger.  The place is very family oriented and great for kids.  I had the BBQ burger with the side of garlic fries.  The garlic fries are excellent, don't recommend them if you're going on a date."}
{"text":"The last few times I've been here, I've just eaten at the bar tables, so I don't expect really great service, but it was better than I was expecting.  The burgers are always good, which is pretty much why people eat at Red Robin in the first place.  Bonus for bringing them lettuce wrapped upon request, and extra bonus for having sweet potato fries, which were delicious."}
{"text":"Come here for lunch often with coworkers and decided to bring mom this past Friday. This is burger heaven, and I love the fact that you can substitute the typical red meat patty for a Boca or Gardenburger patty if you're vegetarian like I am.

This past visit was pretty decent. The server we had was very attentive and friendly and the food was right on par. Only downside is that our server forgot to ask if we would like fries while we waited on our lunch. I didn't bother to ask because they typically ask or just automatically bring them to you. So we waited for ten minutes until our lunch arrived and once it did, they brought my mom fruit instead of fries as her side. So then I asked for a basket of fries.

Mom ordered the Simple Burger and it didn't come with cheese. Neither of us noticed that it didn't from the menu, so we had to ask for a slice of cheese on the side. 

At the end of the day, the food was great and the fries are always great. Only downfall is that we were both starving and didn't get the bottomless fries treatment. All in all, I'll be back in some fashion, whether it be with coworkers, mom or friends. 

PS
You guys need to get on the Coke Zero bandwagon!!"}
{"text":"This used to be my husbands and I go to restaurant.  From now on however I feel like we will be making a different choice.  The food quality had gone way down in my opinion. They advertise a chicken brushetta sandwich but it's just a burger with the tomatoes cut up.  I was very disappointed and expected something more.  My husband ordered his usual Schroom burger with Provolone cheese.   When it came out it was absolutely drenched in grease.  I understand a certain amount of grease is expected being a burger and all but the whole bottom of his bun was just soaked.  It was disgusting.  He ate it not being one to complain but he felt sick after.  We will most likely not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Red Robin is one delicious chain restaurant.. We live pretty close to this location and it seems have become a go to establishment when we do not know what to do for dinner.. How do you not try like a place that offers bottomless steak fries and Buzzard sauce. 
The burgers are always winking at you too... Now that is an amazing trick they pull with the way they wrap the burger. Take a close look next time you hit Red Robin, The Burger has this open face that you do not get at all run of the mill burger joint... I know, I know what the hell does the way the burger looks have to do with the food or the service. I say EVERYTHING!! Have you ever been served a burger and it is just sitting there in your basket with a HUGE bun that covers the medallion sized burger....... Hmmmm I think the visual matters... 

The service is always great and food hits the spot. If you get a chance to swing by there slap feathers with old red and get your burger on!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible, nasty, poor service. I went today with a party of 3. Service was horrible waited 20 minutes to be seated. Took server forever to bring our drinks. The place was a complete mess and dirty. It wasnt even full, they couldnt sit people due to poor service and dirtiness. There was more dirty tables than people dining. Horrible and nasty. My appetizer and side fries came out 10 min after my main meal. They completely messed up my order and when i ordered extra bottomless fries took them 30 min to come out. They never refilled our drinks and the food was horrible and burger was burnt. Fries were dry and hard and burnt. They sat us outside and forgot about us. I had to call them 5 different times. Plus we were sat oiutside in the entrance of the mall with nothing but nasty dirty tables and food all over the floor were everyone can see. When i mentioned something they were just plain rud. Never go to the galleria mall red robin. Horrible hated my dinning. Will never go again. Im an executive sous chef and ive never been treated like this anywhere and have had poor service such as this. If i can give it 0 stars i would. Never would have expected this from a red robin."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! There were tours going on and we had a 20 minutes to get my food order!  Food is usually good here. The manager was very kind."}
{"text":"I go to this location almost every week with a party of five. Our server is usually Ashley and she's fantastic! She always makes sure that we get our food at a reasonable time and are always good on drinks and condiments. My party always gets the bottomless fries/broccoli and she always makes sure we're never without those. I give this place a four star because the kitchen can be slow at times even when there's not a lot of people in the restaurant. However, the food is always good and staff is accommodating."}
{"text":"I recently wrote a review of their 90th St (ish) and Shea location in Scottsdale. Was not a fan and found the place ridiculously dirty (on more than one visit over many months).

As I said in that review, I've been a Red Robin customer since the 80s from SoCA. After the recent experiences, I was pretty much done. Well, a dinner companion was craving Red Robin so I agreed to go along ... so long as we went to the \"other\" Scottsdale location.

What a relief! Clean as a whistle. 

Friday night. 6:30 p.m. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated in the dining room electing to not sit immediately in the bar. Friendly greeter. Friendly hostess seating us. Pretty prompt recognition from the server.

I ordered my usual gauc bacon burger \"with some pink.\" And, my absolute go-to blended chocolate raspberry shake. 

The only hiccup, which was solved in mere moments was my co-worker had ordered sweet potato fries. They weren't served with the meal. But, the floor manager who'd brought the meals took care of it about as fast as a walk to the kitchen and back. Bravo.

Thank you and kudos to the team at this location. Well done. I'm glad to know I can come back to enjoy a good burger for the money and an amazing custom milkshake again.

Still not a fan of the Z-kiosk gadget. Reason for 3 stars not 4; can't go 5 stars because the burgers really are smaller than in years past. I prefer real human interaction to this gadget. Makes me wonder if they had cash handling issues at some point..."}
{"text":"Ever had a craving for something you used to love but hadn't had in a long time?

That was me tonight for Red Robin. 

Oh so silly. 

Guacamole bacon burger now nearly $12. What!

Tried the \"big\" Tavern Taco Burger. At $10 it's the same size patty as the guac burger. To be fair, it was cooked properly and tasted decent.  But it's not a $10 burger. 

Asked for a monster chocolate,  raspberry shake.  Only $5. But it's 1/2 the size it used to be. Didn't taste raspberry at all. I'm pretty certain they used to use real, hard, ice cream. What they use now comes out of a soft serve machine. If it is still \"ice cream,\" then it's 10% milk fat.

Runner who brought meal didn't ask if I needed anything. Catsup would have been nice. Bottomless fries are only bottomless if more are offered. They weren't until I was clearly completely done.

Bartender/ server had other things on his mind. Looks like there might be a group of regulars. Nice guy. Distracted. Or didn't care. 

It's very rare that I don't tip.  I didn't. 

Will have to beat down future cravings. Darn. Used to patronize this chain a lot. Now I remember why I stopped."}
{"text":"I've been a Red Robin customer since the mid 80s. But, those days are done.

In the last couple years, sadly, they have gone down hill dramatically. This is true for locations not only in metro Phoenix but southern CA, too.

Burgers seem smaller. I won't argue with their decision to change how they serve their \"endless\" fries. You can still have all you want - it's just a lot less likely that pounds and pounds of potatoes will go to waste like they must have in the past. The service is inconsistent. When I was last at this location, late on a weeknight, the place was dead. Many tables needed to be cleaned but no one seemed to care. I was seated in the bar area despite specifically asking for dining room. The bartender himself served me. He was nice, but he had a bar to tend. No doubt he (accurately) figured his better chance for tip money was his bar customers so I was a bit ignored with dirty tables all around me.

I do appreciate they use real ice cream. Mixing chocolate and raspberry is simply amazing. Sadly, not all servers understand how to make this happen. Sometimes I get one flavor in the glass cup and the other in the metal cup. I didn't want a chocolate shake AND a raspberry shake. One time I got one flavor and my companion got the other. When they blend it right, then there is nothing better in life in terms of a milkshake.

I can't think of the name of the automated interactive system they've implemented. I really do not like this. I could see the system being perfect in a busy bar for faster service and table turns. But, in Red Robin? Come on, just let a server come by and take my order. Let a runner serve me. Then check in from time to time without needing to be summoned - electronically or otherwise. Oh, and that tip calculator it has? Makes it easy to short the server because they aren't really servers any more.

Too bad. 

Many other choices now for much better burgers at not-too-much-more prices. And, those other places have human beings as servers who are polite and friendly. Kind of like what Red Robin used to be."}
{"text":"Officially done with Red Robin.

Arrived 8:30 on a weeknight. Greeted and seated promptly by a polite young woman. 

Server took drink orders quickly. 2 \"monster\" shakes. Well, when did the portion size go down? It used to be that the metal container was completely full and the amount in the glass was equal to the metal cup. Now the glass is a goofy shape, clearly much smaller. The metal cup is less than 1/2 full AND it fills the goofy glass. Therefore, they've cut the portion in half and kept the price where it had been. Not cool!

Burgers were cooked properly. Guacamole bacon burger was just OK. Whiskey River BBQ was disappointing. Service was slow. Dining room mostly empty. Prices now north of $11. Not worth it.

And, they still use Ziosk. Boo. Personal service is better."}
{"text":"This is a solid choice for lunch when you're at the Waterfront. Super kid-friendly and if you're a big burger fan then you're all set. My go-to here is the BLTA on a croissant, which isn't as messy as their burgers can be, and \"feels\" healthy since it has avocado. Am I kidding myself with that, maybe? But, my husband and I can enjoy a fairly good meal with our toddler. Would we come here sans kid for dinner, no. But we don't really go anywhere for dinner anymore.

Also, servers are VERY friendly, A+ to them!"}
{"text":"My wife was craving a burger, and she wanted to come here for lunch.  Red Robin is always decent, so I was excited to try out this location near our house.  We drove down, walked inside and were seated within about 5 minutes.  We went with an appetizer of some pretzel bites and \"beer cheese\", my wife got a side salad, and for our entrees, I went with a Patty Melt and my wife went with a basic burger.  I had a Coke to drink.  Here is how everything was.............

Pretzel Bites-  Eh...they were ok.  They were only $5.00, so the price was right.  They give you about 15 small pretzel nuggets and a little shot glass full of cheese.  The pretzels were nice and hot, but they were a bit wet, and the salt didn't really stick to the bites.  The beer cheese was tasty.  They were alright but I don't think I would get them again.

Patty Melt-  This was good!  It was cooked a perfect medium, had a nice amount of onions and cheese and it was placed between some marbled rye bread.  It was a tad small, but still filled me up.

Fries-  They provide you with all you can eat fries.  They are thick cut steak fries and come with some magic dust seasoning.  They were alright.  My son mowed down a bunch of fries.  That doesn't say much though as far as the quality since he will pretty much enjoy ANY french fry you give him.

Service was just ok.  Friendly at first, but then lacking throughout the meal.  Our waitress did acquire a large party about midway through our meal, so she was tending to them most of the time.  We did have to ask another waitress for a refill on soda and for more fries since our waitress was busy.  

Total for everything with tax and tip was $40.00!  A little bit high if you ask me.  The burgers were good, but not $40.00 good. They do have a cool tablet on your table where you can pay for your bill.  We used that, and were on our way.  We passed a bunch of people on the way out of the restaurant and nobody thanked us for coming in or wished us a good rest of our day.  Not too big of a deal, but some smiles or acknowledgement would have made me feel better as we were walking out.  Not too sure how soon we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Our server Justin was all over it. Very friendly and on his game. We even had Katie and Brianna check on us to make sure we were good.  And the icing on the cake... the manager Mindie was so nice. She checked on us several times.  She even took time out of her day to chat my family and I. Not something you see anymore.  Great service guys / gals !!!"}
{"text":"Far from gourmet. I ordered off the tavern menu, I asked for the Smokey Jack double, I got 2 dry cardboard flavored thin patties, half of an onion, no bbq sauce, the Smokey sauce soaked into the dry bun. Mcdoubles have more flavor. My girlfriend ordered the black & bleu, the server asked her how she wanted it cooked, mid well, doesn't ask me at all, and her burger came out bloody, seared on both ends. Like what the hell? I'd understand if both were over cooked, but to have burgers on both end of the poorly cooked spectrum is even worse. My girlfriend spent the rest of the night at home, vomiting from the half a burger she could get down. All around pretty awful experience. I won't go back.
Only getting 2 stars because; bottomless fries."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location. Our server, Hamilton, was outstanding, especially managing a group of nine women. I ordered a turkey burger wrapped in lettuce with bacon and guac. It came with a side which I kept as the recommended salad. The reason for the three stars was that while the turkey burger was excellent, the guac was a shmear and the bacon undercooked and did not look like the photo on the website. I tasted the famous fries and thought they were lacking in flavor. I will return due to the excellent service and management of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Here tonight.  Restaurant is less than half full.  Ordered food - just 2 burgers and fries as is on the menu no changes - took almost 40 minutes for the food to get to us.  Food was almost completely cold.  Several tables throughout entire restaurant not cleaned off - they were piled high with dirty dishes when we got here and when we left.  Only giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because the waitress was polite, friendly and smiled."}
{"text":"I have been to several Red Robin's locations in the area. The atmosphere is pretty laid back and chilled. The staff is always friendly as a matter of fact the witnesses we had today we had last time we were here and that was about a year ago. Today me and my family came just because we had a taste for it. The Manager was very very friendly and as always the service was good. However no matter when I have went the food is only average. The image Red Robin portrays you would expect better than average food. Also if you are like me and like chili cheese fries but don't like beans beware they have beans in there chili. On a good note when it's your birthday they give you a free ice cream sundae and burger! OMG it's is so...... GOOD! We was here about a week after my birthday but I had to the end of the month to use my free birthday burger so that's how I ended up with the sundae. It was so good I didn't want to share so I had to buy my kids a free one. Over all a good spot but would be so much better if they improved the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This red Robin is conveniently located in Tempe. A freestanding building with plenty of free parking. We were here for a business lunch with four people.  With that in mind, I knew their menu offers a variety of options and certainly would be able to please each of us. Tempted to order a cheeseburger, I was traveling and wanted to lean more toward the healthy side. I ordered the chicken Caesar wrap and a side salad. Everything was delicious and prepared with fresh ingredients. It was a good choice.

After eating we went through our business agenda, and at the same time, the servers continue to refill our drinks and offer some of the other refills on their bottomless french fry potatoes. Terrific service.

If you're ready to eat and want a hearty lunch in Tempe, I am proud to recommend this red Robin restaurant. 

Salute!"}
{"text":"Destiny was an awesome server. We appreciated her attentiveness and positive attitude. I would come to this location again because she was so kind and welcoming"}
{"text":"Their jalapeno coins are yummy. Get the petite burger- it is a dollar cheaper and less calories. Its not on the menu but they know what it is."}
{"text":"I have been trying to reduce my caloric intake and found out that at Red Robin you can order a \"petite\" burger. It is smaller but has the same toppings you order on the regular. So for those of you that don't want to have a burger that is 1000 calories (yes they are and more with the endless fries) , try the petite."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm saying this is a 5 star experience because I was a little \"toasted\" when we showed up here.  We were next door at Michoacan for their Sunday brunch.  So, we decided to sit in the bar and hangout a little longer.

There was ample seating in the bar and they had a booth that fit the 6 of us perfectly.  I wanted to get rid of my buzz and there is nothing better than a milkshake and fries to do that.  I ordered the cookie shake and it was great.  $5 for the shake and extra in the tin.  Our waitress was great too.  She checked up on us to make sure everything was okay.

The only problem I had with the place was the urinal.  It was about a foot off of the ground.  I think it's a test to see if you're sober or not.  If you piss on your shoes then you have to wait a little while longer before you can drive.  I was good to go!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with our experience! The first negative moment was was when we were seated and handed two very dirty plates for the appetizers. The explanation we were given was, \"sometimes the dishwasher doesn't get everything.\" UGH. 

For dinner I got the bacon cheeseburger with the bbq sauce, and garlic fries. The burger was nice and juicy, but that was the only highlight. The garlic fries were flaccid and boring - I was surprised. Maybe they'd been sitting around?  I didn't finish them. 

For dessert we tried the chocolate shake with the Oreos. That shake was like milk - truly not much thicker than water, and the Oreos were all clumped at the bottom. Pretty gross. Overall, our two-person dinner, unfortunately, wasn't worth the money or time we spent.

The next day I asked a coworker who loves Red Robin about my experience and she was very surprised to hear about the dirty plates, limp fries and watery shake, and said the restaurant near her is really good. Although we're not willing to try Red Robin again, it is possible this location just isn't as good as other Red Robins."}
{"text":"Solid burger and fries.  Artichoke dip was good.  Went opening night and was little hectic but server made it happen once she found us.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"let me tell you when you need a place to go to get an amazing burger. you better go to red robin. the greatest burgers ever and if you have a craving for fries get the bottomless fries and they mean bottomless because free refills how about that. and not to expensive either"}
{"text":"Ate here twice on a vacation. Both times were good and everyone left happy. 

Only pitfall is this chain gets \"locked\" into mandatory beer handles. I'd love to see more local favorites and less domestics."}
{"text":"After a horrible couple days at work I was extremely pleased to be pampered by the service here. Haley was such a pleasure to have as a server. She refilled our cups constantly and was always smiling. The food was also fantastic! Red Robin has good food in general but this has been the best one we have been to. The manager was also extremely friendly. We will be back for sure. Thanks for making my day!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever had in a restaurant. The waiter was absolutely terrible and proceeded to talk about our party in the \"back\" which was located right next to our table. Not only did we wait almost 20 minutes for water, we never got refills on fries, water or anything else. By the time the manager got involved we had had enough. The food isn't good enough to deal with such terrible service and the worst part is that it wasn't even busy, just seriously sucky service and from the reviews I'm seeing, it is not the exception, but the norm. Plenty of other places in Downtown Summerlin to choose from for sure."}
{"text":"I came here to get a  few beers and a burger in the bar. When I entered the restaurant there wasn't a greeter or host. Someone did come eventually and prompted me to sit not in the bar. I asked her for the bar. She said the bartender was 'seated'. Whatever that means. I was seated in an area next to the bar. I go to sit down in a chair and it's dirty. I go to the next chair and brush off the food debris. I look around my area and the carpet has food debris. The table tops are dirty. I start to think, \"I can walk out. I don't deserve to eat in a filthy environment. This isn't worth it.\" This is the second time I've had a terrible experience at a restaurant chain in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service: its pretty good. But I could feel some kind of attitude at the same time. The waitress was nice and joyous however i could tell she was because its her job. This other waitress came and gave us something and asked her for extra barbecue and she never brought it. Technically she wasnt the waitress assigned to us but why she ask if we needed something if she wasnt gonna do it. I give it a five star because the waitress assigned to us tried really hard although I sensed attitude she still put in effort. Her attitude was mostly all good. 

Food: Its really good. The burgers we ordered was very nicely done and definitely satisfying. Very fattening. It was a 13.99 burger. With the strawberry drink it 4.45. Altogether 41.99. With extra garlic fries. Which were unnecessary the food is already very filling."}
{"text":"THE MAP ON THIS PAGE IS WRONG. IT IS NOT AT CHANDLER BLVD IT IS AT TEMPE MARKETPLACE! (for those who can't figure it out by the address being Tempe not Chandler) So I had  never been to a Red Robin before.... and I had a free birthday burger so I wandered over to Tempe Marketplace and ta-da! We were seated immediately wherever we wanted. Our waitress, JJ, was really nice. I was surprised to find out that my birthday burger also came with a side! And what was really awesome is she gave my boyfriend a basket of fries for free! The burger itself was huge.... I had lettuce, tomato, provolone cheese, avacado and bacon (I had the bacon guacamole burger but got avacado instead of guacamole due to boyfriend's onion allergy) Well. As you probably can guess, the burger was quickly devoured and I had sweet potato fries. I couldn't even eat the first refill because I was so stuffed from the burger. The fries were good though, but the sweet potato and the regular steak fries. JJ made a great suggestion of dipping the sweet potato fries into ranch. Great experience and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Steer clear of the Prime rib dip, stick to burgers and chicken sandwiches. Advice from a very helpful server. Do that and the food is great!"}
{"text":"This is a Go-To Spot for my family. We love their simple delicious burgers at reasonable prices. Good side dishes, kid-friendly and usually good service."}
{"text":"Waited 20 min to be seated (which is normal on a Friday night) but was very disgusted when we were seated and the table directly next to us was still dirty from the diners who were sitting there before. We ended up eating our whole meal (approx 1 hr) while the table right NEXT to us was still dirty. Not very pleasing if you're eating dinner with dirty plates and left over food."}
{"text":"Food was great. However we waited over 30 minutes for our food once ordered   Server was nice and offered a free dessert. Manager brought it to us and apologized for the wait. Appreciate their efforts to make up for the wait."}
{"text":"Red Robin has great burgers. I love that they also have the option of Boca burgers or Gardenburgers to replace your regular ground beef with if you would like. The wait staff is always attentive and friendly and my drink is never empty. They have a good selection on their kids menu too which is always nice for my super picky kids."}
{"text":"I wanted to mention the bathrooms, they're both small and awkward. There is only one soap dispenser and it's next to a motion sensor paper towel dispenser. There are three sinks, so if it's full it's difficult to wash your hands."}
{"text":"Red Robin always disappoints. Cold fries, hair in the food, dry burger. Thought we would be good since they just opened, but nope, still disappointing."}
{"text":"Great customer service! We have had awesome servers every time we have gone & pretty darn good food too."}
{"text":"The servers are very friendly and fast. The food is fresh and tasty. Having a kids menu helps. We love the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Overpriced burgers, they are pretty good, but still not worth the price. Now you can pay at your table with technology. Why do I bother? I'll get a more personable treatment at In-N-Out for 1/4 of the price of the burger."}
{"text":"Met with friends for late lunch. Both my friend and I ordered the Avo-Cobb-O salad. The avocado kind of stood us up. Not much in the salad. The salad was nice and the veggies were fresh. My friend's husband ordered the Cod fish and chips. They both asked for extra toast cause it's delicious. Our server did an ok job. Would have liked the teas and water topped off. It was a very hot Arizona day. May stop in if I'm the area during my next visit. Average food at average place with somewhat average prices."}
{"text":"We loved it! Food was great! Unlimited drinks and fries too! Even gave my husband a strawberry lemonade to go. The burgers are made with good quality meat. Mine was dripping it was so juicy! Service is wonderful too! Filled our drinks right away every time!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry for the places that have to put up with is when the entire family wants to get together. I'm happy some people showed up before me as the waiting area felt like I was snuggled in a can of sardines barely able to move. 

Once we did get seated, Kathy was an absolute sweetheart. She handled a chaotic order of 12 people seamlessly and played along with our shenanigans. My order ended up being the forgotten, but didn't really mind as it was busier than white bloods cells trying to kill the flu in you. 

Overall I had a great time and my niece was happy to celebrate her 6th birthday like she even cared."}
{"text":"This happened a few months ago, but didn't yelp then lol.

We went in around noon on a weekday. In kind of a hurry because my wife only had an hour on her lunch break. We were seated. Hardly anyone in the restaurant. We sat and weighted for 15 minutes... literally 15 minutes. No one ever came to our table, so we got up and left. My wife said something to the manager as we were leaving. She tried to give us a coupon for a free meal, we didn't take it though. 

Came back 1 time since then. Similar situation. Our waiter came and took our drinks, didn't come back with them for 10 or 15 minutes. We sat and watched him chatting with the cooks just messing around.

A shame cause I love Red Robins food, and this location used to be good years ago, but it sucks now. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Red Robin offers vegan & vegetarian (yes, there's a difference) burgers, so they automatically get cool points from me. They are also knowledgable about the ingredients in their foods, so be it allergies or preferences, it's easy to find out what you can and/or cannot eat here. For example, the seasoning for the steak fries is NOT vegan-friendly, so ask for regular salt or no salt, if you're vegan.

I like this location. Some of the managers will walk around and ask how your meal and service was; that's a great customer service gesture. Most of the waiters and waitresses are very friendly, attentive, & efficient. I've only run across a couple who could use an attitude adjustment or basic customer service training. 

The food is always good. There are so many options and ways to customize your burger. Being vegan, my food orders are always a bit complicated (no this, extra that, etc.), but they always get it right when I dine in. They put cheese on my vegan to-go order once, but I called, informed the manager, and it was swiftly rectified. 

On a side note, we came to this location for dinner on Super Bowl night and they allowed us to stay and watch the entire game. Even after we had finished eating they kept checking on us to see if we needed drink refills. I thought that was pretty awesome. 

Numerous large TVs throughout the restaurant, so wherever you're seated you'll have a good clear view of at least 2 TV screens. (Unless you're sitting outside on the patio.) It's generally clean in both the dining area & the restroom.

{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars because we received the best service. Our server Danielle was so prompt, professional, and surely knows how to deliver on a 22 Stella!

Now, the rest of the \"corporate\".
Do not like the new blah, monotone colors, and lackluster decor.
RR is always vibrant, happy and loud.

The whiskey river bbq chicken sandwich is my regular, go to entree, and I love the garlic parmesan parsley fries.

All to be told, they don't make those anymore!!!! What what? Corporate, we need to bring those back!!

All in all, food was okay.... service was awesome, thank you Danielle."}
{"text":"My wife and our kids went to Red Robin around 8pm on a Saturday night after swimming for most of the day.  We were tired and very hungry.  I like to bring the kids here because they are usually entertained by the activities at the table that are there for them.  They usually color something, read, watch television, or worse case I'll bring out the Ipad!


     This night there were a lot of kids here because there was a soccer tournament in town.  So we had to wait a little bit but not too long.  I really like their kid's menus here.  Even my daughter eats here and she is so picky!  It's good for kids and it's loud so I don't have to tell them to talk more softly.  


     For me and the wife the food was ok.  My wife loves burgers but they never get it right for her here.  I always get the Whiskey BBQ and I really like that burger.  No complaints.  What I didn't like was my bottomless sweet potatoes fries.  I got a few orders of fries but they were like the bottom of the basket fries.  They always come like this so I don't think that I'm just getting unlucky either.  I had to start stealing my kid's fries!  My wife did like her bottomless salad.  That helped but overall I say we come here more for the kids than for a gourmet burger for ourselves.  


     They do always have good beer on tap here so that is always a plus.  Service is usually ok nothing too bad.  Just watch playing those electronic games at your table because they will charge you!  The devices on the tablr now show you the menu, your bill, and you can pay from there too.  It is neat.  I would give this Red Robin a 3 if it was just my wife and I out for the night but I will give them a 4 just because it's a good place to take our kids and still have an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"This place is pretty average. They've got a good selection of burgers, but they're just okay to me. I try to get whatever is the newest burger just to try. I like how they have half sizes of full sizes appetizers. The Buzz sauce for the wings is pretty decent. And the brownie sticks for dessert is tasty! I like how they imitate the appearance of fries and have a ketchup container for the dipping sauce."}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of Red Robin locations. They have gluten free buns, as well as a dedicated fryer to avoid cross contamination. This is perfect for diners with celiac disease. The French fries are typically coated with a seasoned salt that is not gluten free, so be sure to tell your server you want your entire meal to be gluten free to avoid symptoms. 
The last three or four times I ate at a Red Robin my server typically goes AWOL, especially when I seem to need something. A server once spent 5 minutes telling me about her morning, that included watching her cat take it's last breath. 
Food wise, everything is consistent! Also, if you like tomato lettuce and mayo on your burger, be sure to ask for them as you order because your server might not check up on you after the food is dropped.
Today I ordered a chocolate milkshake, and without asking, the server charged me for a \"monster\" $4.99 shake that includes refills instead of giving me a regular size shake, which is all I wanted. My burger was free because it's my birthday month.
Will I continue to come back? Yes, but when Burgatory opens in the waterfront I'll probably never see the inside of Red Robin again."}
{"text":"Its a shame but I only gave this place two stars because ultimately they don't care about the customer. Of course. My fries were cold and the next batch where better. But the third was the best. Must literally be cooking only small batches at a time.  That's fine but learn how to treat the customer. Make my fries fresh don't give me some else next batch or whatever. It's not hard!  It really ainr"}
{"text":"Not worth the price, sooo disappointed! Appetizer (boneless wings) is tough, hamburger is salty, fork and knife are blotted......"}
{"text":"Food was good got seated quickly our server Joseph was very friendly and kept our drinks full before they were empty."}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day with a group friends to celebrate the holiday. Our waitress was very friendly and took our drink and dinner orders. It had to of been a half hour and only 3 people from my party got their food. No one else got their food we waited and waited. I'd say about 50 mins later our food still didn't come out. We finally called a manager to see what was taking so long. Our waitress apologized tons saying  she had no clue why the kitchen was taking long. Finally the manager told us our food was pushed to the side, forgotten and got cold. She had the kitchen make fresh meals for us and our dinners were on the house. While we waited they kept refilling our fries. The manager apologized again and again. We felt bad for our waitress because it was not her fault and she did take care of us and noticed something was wrong as well as the manager. They handled the situation well. Though I would rather have food out on time and pay then wait and starve to get a meal on the house. I wish I could remember our waitresses name. She did good."}
{"text":"C and I hit the RR for some burgers. I had a birthday \"free burger\" coupon that I needed to use before it expired. I think our visit was predestined when we first walked up to the front doors. C held open the door for a group of 5 as they were leaving. NONE of them said \"Thank You\". Seriously? Get some manners &%$holes. When someone holds a door open for you whether you're coming or going, acknowledge them. Geez, my 10 year old has better manners than most adults. 
Anywhoos, as I said, that should have told us how our night would go. After the human turds left, we went up to the host stand and waited. Hmmm, I'm sure someone will help us soon I told C. It wasn't that long, maybe a minute or 2 but eventually a hostess came up, grabbed some menus and walked us to our table. We sat and then waited for our server. And wait we did. After 10 minutes (I start the timer on my phone as soon as we're sat) I told C we would give them another minute before leaving. C suggested that we just move to another table because he really wanted a RR burger and reminded me that I had my birthday coupon. Alright, we gave our server another minute to show up, they didn't, so I walked back over to the host stand and asked to be re-sat. The same hostess apologized and took us to another section. Now we've been there 15 minutes and are finally getting started. 
Our second server was Sydney. Awesome. She apologized for the issue and took our drink orders. NOTE: If you're ordering your kid one of the fancy lemonades, make sure they bring the kid version. We've been charged over $4 for C to get a \"Poppin Lemonade\" in the past but this time, it was $1.19. Just saying...
So C got his Poppin Purple lemonade ($1.19) which came with a free refill this time. We had to pay for the refill last time. Interesting. C also ordered the Little Red's Burger with Fries ($4.99). The burger was cooked properly, Medium, and the fries as well. C had also ordered a side of pickles, as he always does and Sydney hooked him up. 16 pickles in a little ramekin. C was a happy camper.
I ordered the Peppercorn Burger ($10.99), sauce on the side with endless Broccoli. The patty was cooked a perfect medium rare and was seasoned correctly. This was a tasty burger. The issue came with the Broccoli. Both times, the original and refill, were undercooked. Not by a little, by a lot. Hard, basically raw broccoli just isn't complimentary to the meal. Bummer.
Sydney brought out the Birthday Sundae for C and I to share. Some average vanilla ice cream with fudge on top but it was a nice way to finish the meal. 
Crappy first 15 minutes of service, good kids burger, good peppercorn burger, good fries, lousy broccoli, great service from Sydney Po. 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, 8 pm, no wait. I ordered the Lone Star burger as pink as they could do it with the bottomless broccoli. The patty was cooked nicely but there was not much guacamole on it & the bun was cold. The broccoli was undercooked & underseasoned. Our waitress Casey was awesome refilling drinks without being asked and staying on top of our needs."}
{"text":"So where do I start ... it took what seemed like forever to take our drink and food order. When we finally received our drinks my husband's glass had what looked like a mixture of some syrupy stuff mixed with lipstick. When we finally got our waitresses attention she did take it and we couldn't figure out why it took her so long to come back. When she finally did, she advised that she had brought back the same glass and that she had rubbed the rim with soda water because the dishware didn't work very welll. :/ (disturbing)  we then ordered appetizers which took so long we forgot we had even ordered them. The burger was ordered medium but was so red it looked almost raw... I have to tell you that we go to the location in Henderson all the time and we have always had excellent service. That was not the case here today. I will say that in my opinion. It wasn't the poor lost soul that that served us that was at fault but lack of training and weak management that is to blame. Obviously I do not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"I love red robin! This location is almost always busy but we never have a wait as they seat us in the bar during busy times. Always get a nice and attentive server and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Took the whole family here for dinner. My mushroom burger was delicious, the bottom bun was a bit soggy. Kids all liked their burgers and chicken tenders. Service was good. Waited a bit for refills on drinks."}
{"text":"Why did they change the menu I asked when we were seated? The red, white and blue salad was one of my favorites. The waitress replied that it was a popular salad but they just decided to change it.

The other major menu change is your salad and soup pairing. You can now only pair a tossed salad with soup. Any other salad is considered a full meal portion salad. So I opted new bonsai salad and ordered a cup of french onion soup as a side. The soup came in a small square bowl. The salad was full sized but nothing to give a hoot about.

FYI They have not removed the soup and sandwich pairing so I guess I'll have to go that route next time.

Service was good and they did save me money by using my rewards card.

Sometimes it is better not to change a popular menu item for something not as exciting."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my son the other day and was pleasantly surprised that they don't limit themselves to burgers. I had a delicious avocado chicken salad. The size was big but since the food was \"light\" to eat I was able to finish it without any problem. It is a nice chain and will probably visit it again sometime."}
{"text":"Red Robin is probably hands down one of my favorite chain restaurants. However the one in the village is pretty bad. The service is less than desirable. I was meeting a friend and told the host that they were sat already and instead of taking me to the table just told me in so many words that I could look around for them. Actually those were the words. Then our server didn't smell very pleasant. I won't say her name bc it's embarrassing but it's not really appetizing to have your server stink. Our appetizers and meals were put in at the same time so they of course came out at the same time which was annoying. Then my sandwich was mad and at that point I was just irritated and ate my super soggy \"crispy\" chicken sandwich! This is not the first time I've had a poor experience there. But this may have been my breaking point."}
{"text":"I like this location and they've done a good job redecorating. They are usually busy at all times especially during sporting events. One thing I've noticed at this location is that when something is wrong with your order they will automatically send a manager over to see what was wrong and was it fixed. This is nice, but today the managers response was \" well it wasn't her fault\" I was a little taken back by this 1. I didn't ask you to come over here and 2. I never blamed the server or anyone for that matter . Customer service is important and red robin has the right idea but let's keep the responses to \"I'm sorry how can I make this better?\" It's not a blame game"}
{"text":"Excellant hamburger and fries.  Carlos was a great server.  Very clean restrurant.  Great service."}
{"text":"My mom and I were shopping at the mall and decided to have lunch here.  They were quite busy so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  Not bad at all.

Our waitress came by pretty quickly and said she would be right back.  She came back shortly and took our orders.  She was a bit slow explaining the check process with their on-table machines.  So we did end up checking out through the machine but it was out of paper so we never got our receipt.

I started with the fried pickles.  They come with a spicy sauce but the waitress asked if I wanted ranch for them.  I said yes but when they came they had the spicy sauce.  Later though she brought me ranch.

I had the Banzai burger in a lettuce wrap.  This is a tasty burger with pineapple and lots of cheese.  A bit hard to eat in the lettuce so you end up knife and forking it but its still good.  And I love their fries.  The serving of fries was a bit smaller than normal but I think they are unlimited so we could have asked for more.

Mom had the Southern Charm burger.  She had asked for no produce but still wanted the grilled onions, bacon and cheese.  Well they messed it up and brought tomato and no onions.  Mom ate it anyway and said it was okay.

So a bit a miss on a few things but overall not bad."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a chilly May night!!! Yes, you read that right . chilly in AZ.. In May!!!! Anyway... Our party of four thoroughly enjoyed our orders and can't say enough nice things about out waitress Bernadette.  The Black and Bleu burger was DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the Goodyear location on Tuesday evening. After a initial order of drinks by the only person taking orders we waited at least 15 min for our order to be placed. Now I normally just order a plain hamburger with cheese, but for some stupid reason I ordered one of the special burgers with a special sauce, onion rings and onion straws. Very disappointed. Worst burger I ever tried to eat. Now I'm the person that cleans off his plate no matter what. But on this occasion I did leave half the burger. Waitress came by to offer more of there bottomless fries. I said sure, I'll take some. Why not there bottomless, right. Right, bottomless because they only give you a handful these days. Sure enough she came with more, again a handful for me and my wife. Whatever. Time to pay, I couldn't wait. I have been at this location at least 10 times in the past 12 mo and have never had a correct bill on their little kiosks to pay from. Sure enough it didn't work and waitress had to change the bill and ring it up herself. When will I ever learn. I just did. Listen people check your Bill's there all wrong especially if you have a discounted item, no go etc. I think I\"ll just skip by Red Robin for a year."}
{"text":"I really, really need to be in a good mood to come to this Red Robin. The burgers are generally very good looking when they arrive. I usually get a veggie burger, knowing their more than likely Morningstar Farms brand and that's my gripe. Red Robin prides themselves on their burgers, toppings, cheeses, and buns. Why not take some of those gourmet burger chefs at corporate and come up with a flavorful meatless burger? I really mind spending 10 bucks on a Morningstar Farms burger that they nuke and toss on a bun. 

Three stars for the Speckled Lemonade. Five stars for the quesadilla, it was my go to meal before going meatless."}
{"text":"I got a garden burger that was dry as dirt and my husband got another burger that was too runny/sloppy. What really pissed me off was the fact that our suck ass waiter never came to see if we wanted more \"bottomless fries.\" We waited for him to for a long time. They charge you .75 cents for each sauce you order for the fries and honestly the fries and sauces are better than the burgers we ordered. Waste of money/time/calories. I can totally see why this place has 2 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"One of my kids favorite restaurant and I love how it was available for delivery! Unfortunately my order was missing some items that I added and got charged for. The food was still good just wished they would have included the crispy onion straws to my burger as I ordered it to make it awesome!"}
{"text":"My experience at first was the girls at sat us down read it this is soon as we got in but then they continue the conversation personal conversation and we stood there for a couple minutes before they took us to her seat I thought oh boy here we go
Then here comes or waitress McKenzie I need to tell the management she did an awesome job she was one of the most attentive servers I have ever had she greeted us with a great smile she had a great sense of humor great personality new one to ask us questions was on the spot I never have a looked ask for anything give that girl a raise I am Annesley have to say that we gave her 30% tip thank you McKenzie you're an awesome person great job"}
{"text":"Good burgers, chicken fingers, fries, and bear. My partner had a really good Carmel shake also. Lots of TVs with plenty to go around for everyone's sports' taste. They were very accommodating and allowed us to watch the game we wanted to see. Service was great, unlike the Melt Grill a couple of doors down..."}
{"text":"My old friend from Italy told me to check out a Red Robin establishment. I don't know what my Italian friend was talking about when he said to stop here. This is/was not the place for me.

Where was the shrimp scampi or even better yet, a nice plate of spaghetti and meatballs? I had to try one of these fancy burgers that they had plastered everywhere on their sticky menu. Such a waste of good meat that could've been formed into a nice meatball in a heaping plate of spaghetti and meatballs.

The hostess started my experience off by placing me in a seat in their rowdy bar area. I really didn't want to sit here but I was told it would make me feel like I was in Italy. The hostess really doesn't know anything because Italy is not a bar."}
{"text":"Excellent bar service. Marcy is a great bartender. The food was overall very good. I really have nothing bad to say.,"}
{"text":"My husband and I were here with my 2 1/2 year old who decided to throw a fit. I took my son outside to talk to him and calm him down when a waitress by the name of Laurie asked if she could get my son some frys. She told me she was a grandma and understood. She reassured me I was a good mom. My son calmed down, we followed Laurie back inside where she quickly grabbed some frys and oranges. At the table she then proceeded to hand my son some stickers to play with. She was AWESOME. We were able to enjoy our meal."}
{"text":"One thing I've learned about this place. Stick to the burgers. Tried a \"healthier\" option and was disappointed. That is not what they excel in. Go here if you're craving a burger. Love the Black & Bleu burger. Fabulously tasty. Moist and tender grilled black Angus beef, grilled portobello mushrooms, caramelized onions, bleu cheese sauce  AND bleu cheese crumbles.... perfect combo of flavors.  Bottomless steak fries are yummy too. Stuffed as I am half way through, the burger tastes so good I manage to make the whole thing disappear, Plentiful portions for sure, as I couldn't make it to the bottom of the fry cup. No complaints. Great food, prompt arrival of food, great waitress. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Red Robin is an upbeat restaurant and bar.  We were immediately greeted by a very friendly hostess whoo immediately seated us.  Within a few moments or drink order was taken. Drinks arrived as ordered and our food order was taken.  The good came right out as ordered.  Waitress was friendly and efficient.  Good isn't 5 stars but tasty and fresh.  We had no complaints.  I will return her when in the area."}
{"text":"Wait: Came in around 2:00pm on a Friday and waited 10 minutes although there was plenty of seating to be seated right away.

Service: Kind but slow.

Food: Removed vegan patty option entirely from the menu and made the dishes smaller. Salads not worth the price after removing meat and cheese and other things that aren't vegan. Good options for vegetarians, but not good for vegans anymore. 

Overall: Don't recommend for vegans. My dad eats everything and still is not a big fan of it. Good for kids."}
{"text":"Grody. Glass for my drink was not clean. Bathroom needed attention. Menu was sticky. Food on floor trampled for 30 mins. They can't tell you the ingredients of the food if you have allergies. They'll hand you a filth crusted iPad with an app for you to figure it out for yourself. Great if you want all the quality and standards of a neglected McDonald's but want to pay twice as much"}
{"text":"We just went to Red Robin in California and we had such a pleasant time that I thought we give this location another chance.

The only good thing about the whole visit was the remembered our lemon for our water. Everything else was asked for at lease 10 times ...not kidding ...those that didn't need forks where done by the time we got forks."}
{"text":"A perfect area for your family and good food. But the only thing to bother me is the employees. It's a hit or miss. You either get a nice one or a antisocial just give me your money employee. Better burgers elsewhere in Charlotte. They lack the ability to clean I guess, my table and bench was filthy with crumbs all in the corner."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. Good food selection. Tasty appies. Nice draft beer selection. Hunter always takes amazing care of us and then there's Carter, what a sweetheart. Always leave happy at reeeed robbinnn, yummm!"}
{"text":"Came in for the Birthday Burger and it was delicious!  I was seated rather quickly as I was alone at the bar and the service wasn't fantastic but it was decent.  This review is more about the food since that was amazing.   The burger was perfect.  I ordered a blue cheese burger with crispy onions on a onion bun.  It wasn't the premium but there was no lacking in flavor because of it.  Because I'm very finicky about my sauces I ordered the BBQ on the side and it was actually delicious on the burger!  The fries I ordered the first time were well done and really crunchy without being burnt.  However to be less difficult I ordered my refills regular.  Apparently the birthday burger comes with fries! As I was not aware so that was a pleasant surprise.  Now since I received the burger and fry my bill came to a whopping 0.00 which was disheartening because I wanted to tip and I didn't have cash :(.  The waitress had to ring up a slice of cheese $1.49 to make it happen so if you go remember cash and enjoy! Red Robin is awesome."}
{"text":"Red Robin at Galleria is usually pretty good.  It is a go to eatery for my family.  Got to be honest though, the food is always good, but the service at the Galleria location has declined since the remodel and we have mad the choice to eat elsewhere a few times in the last 3 months.  Last year, that would never of happened."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to Red Robin, but it is not the same restaurant it once was. Our meals came out cold, the buns were soggy, and there were almost no fries. If this was the first time this had happened I would forgive and forget, but this is the fourth time in a row we've had an awful experience at Red Robin. Even my kids don't want to go anymore. Good bye Red Robin."}
{"text":"I've seriously been missing out. I hope I'm not the only person that didn't know the company revamped themselves. The ambience is very mature. I came here for a baby shower being held here. It was work-related so as good as the drinks looked, I couldn't partake. 

The area is large and can seat a number of people. Bathrooms also very clean.

Service was excellent. Due to attending the shower during lunch hour, our group of about 15 came in at staggered times. The server was extremely attentive and was on top of it! He was constantly bussing the tables and even helped serve the cake. 

Food was good. I got the whisky river BBQ burger and it was cooked to perfection. The fries were delicious- so good that a lot of us took advantage of the bottomless fries deals. Some coworkers ordered salads that looked just as delicious as my burger. I honestly wasn't expecting to enjoy coming here but I'm glad to see I was proven wrong."}
{"text":"I was not impressed this time round.  I only make it to this location once a year at most, but my last experience was horrible.  Super full of customers with what seemed like only 3 waiters.  Our service lacked luster, and we always had to flag someone down for more refills.  I'm not hard to get along with.  I only ask for a glass full of iced tea.  Apparently that was hard enough without adding a food order to it, which took 30 minutes to come out to us.  My kids were ravaged and dug right in.  My burger was SO MESSY I had to use a fork and knife to eat it.  There was no way to save it.  Once we flagged our server and asked for the check, it took another 10 minutes before we got it.  We are not happy campers...."}
{"text":"We had a good visit. Positives: Friendly staff, Were seated fairly quickly, food was good. Negatives: The Root Beer Fload was in a huge mug but only filled halfway, the bun was soaked in burger juices. All in all it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Food is solid here, good burgers and fries. Shakes from the bar are amazing too! I gave 3 stars due to the long, 20 minute wait when we came in and the place was empty. Once we got sat it took probably 10 minutes before a server came to see us. All was ok though. Wear a jacket, it's always freezing inside!"}
{"text":"Awful!! Burger was wrong. No mac & cheese on a mac and cheese burger. Fries cane out not as we ordered. We also ordered sweet potato fries and didn't get them. Horrible service. I would drive to the Mesa location and avoid this Red Robin. After all that the manager would not even discount our food."}
{"text":"You should bring back the garlic fries. The new ones are not good. We do around 4 corporate dinners there every year for the last 4 years. Now we need to find a new place."}
{"text":"It is a Red Robin, you know what to expect:
- mediocre service
- consistent but now awe inspired food
- screaming kids
- decent burgers but getting smaller all the time
- small reorders of bottomless fries

I can take it or leave it.  Usually just go when I have a promo coupon but even that is lacking appeal as they continue the downward spiral into oblivion."}
{"text":"First time at this location and it was packed full.  There was only two of us and we were seated immediately, service was fairly quick considering how busy they were.  Burgers didn't have quite as much flavor as I remembered but maybe it was just me as the hubby enjoyed his despite not feeling well.  We'll be back... endless fries"}
{"text":"So it's a chain, it is what it is, but it can be difficult to find a healthy choice at a spot like this or sometimes in general that's fast and quick and easy.  I love the Ensenada Chicken Platter here, it's basically plate of whole foods... Two chicken breasts and a small salad, and a little bit of hot salsa.  Advertised at 416 calories /55g protein it's a been a good choice for me when out and about and wanting to keep lunch on the lighter side and It's actually delicious. I come here just for this dish. 

The service is quick and convenient at this location. I sit in the bar and I am usually in and out in 30 minutes but also full and satisfied and not feeling guilty when I leave. 

I love the on table kiosks so you can simply pay when you are ready to leave. Amy the bartender is nice and they always send me with and Iced Tea to go!!

I don't think you'd normally associate Red Robin as a possible healthy lunch spot so I figured I leave this review. Also, If you travel like I do they are easy to find."}
{"text":"Red Robin had a royale burger that was pretty darn good once you turn that single patty into a double like I did lol."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious no matter what option I've gotten and I LOVE they offer boca patties. The fries are delicious also. Service is always fast and friendly. We usually go after 8 and there's never a wait. We go later to avoid hordes of children and parents. I suppose if I HAD children I would appreciate how they cater to them. Overall it's a very pleasant place especially considering its a chain restaurant which we also usually avoid."}
{"text":"Wow.  I love this place.  Great family atmosphere and great food.  I am there right now and the people watching is....odd.  There are a lot of regular folks in here.  I was seated with my family right in a great spot.  I love to people watch.  About halfway through our meal this couple walked in.  The girl was pretty, but the dude was totally average.  What kind of a guy try's to impress a girl with khaki shorts and a tight polo shirt?  Anyway, they sat down and were deep in conversation.  That is when I noticed I was not the only peeper in the crowd.  I spotted Hank.  He was starring at the dude like he wanted to be with him, completely ignoring the girl.  I recommend Red Robin, but do not recommend Hank. #teammrbo"}
{"text":"I've been going here since childhood.  As always, the burgers are top-notch, bottomless fries are to die for, and good drinks.  One of my fondest memories from childhood is when my family took my grandfather here for his birthday dinner and he was so happy and his face lit up when they came out clapping and singing.  Just a good, solid choice when you want a decent burger but don't feel like spending a crap ton of money at all the \"trendy\" local places."}
{"text":"Waitress Kaitlyn took my order but when I went to tell her what NOT to put on my burger she walked off took twenty minutes and me finally screaming at another waiter to get help! As well the Managers Have a sick employee walking around coughing toward people's food, without covering HIS mouth! When I say cover you mouth he looks at me like I'm the issue, very BAD experience here and crappy service from waitress! As well as Diry Tables!"}
{"text":"It's red robin. We have visited probably 15 locations around the country and they are all fairly standard. Our waitstaff was pleasant, our order was correct. What else could I write."}
{"text":"Burgers are pricey and nothing special and the fries have been both hot and cold depending upon the batch. Service isn't great either."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, place was crazy busy had good service
Ren at the bar was great and a real asset helping the new staff"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good restaurant that focuses on burgers.  They have a great selection of appetizers and I would recommend getting their tower of onion rings.  Every one of the burgers I've tried from here has been good and I would recommend getting one topped with crispy onion straws.  I've also had their French Onion soup and that was very good as well.

It's a great place to bring the kids as they provide some coloring material and the walls and interior are very colorful providing a good distraction for kids to look around.  The noise level is also conducive to kids as you won't get a lot of strange looks if your child happens to get a little loud.  They also have a good selection of chicken sandwiches as well if you aren't in the mood for a burger.  Their steak fries are good and come in a bottomless bucket, with as many refills as you want.  

If you are in the mood for a decent priced burger and looking for quick service I would recommend checking Red Robin out.  I've never had a bad experience with the restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food on service it random as to the quality.  There bathrooms are always nastey and hour clean a bathroom is reflected how clean a kitchen is so get on it.  I will say they are good at keeping your fries full."}
{"text":"One of my kids has a severe tree nut and peanut allergy, so we don't eat out often. When we do, our choices are limited to fast food or chains like Red Robin that provide allergen information online or allergen menus in their restaurants. My \"allergy kid\" adores burgers of all kinds, so Red Robin is his culinary heaven. Red Robin is expensive (I'd rather spend $60 on sushi myself), but checks all our boxes: allergen menu and a lot of food (i.e. BURGERS) he can choose from. Would I seek out Red Robin on my own? Probably not ... I prefer to eat Asian food or finer dining when without the kids. But it allows us to eat out as a family on a level above Culver's with healthier options for us adults. The food's decent and I've never walked out of there hungry or sorry we bothered."}
{"text":"Went with my buddy and my burger was so dry it fell apart on my bun.. So inconsistent"}
{"text":"Went here on a trip home to visit family and its a great place if your taking children out to eat. The food was good and the burgers were a hefty size, I even took home half my burger and was full when i left the restaurant. Im sure the children loved the bottomless rootbeer floats!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, overadvertised, overcooked and for me, just plain over. Red Rubber is the Chi Chi's of burgers. Secretaries going there for happy hour probably think it's the shit. I however, just think it's shit. I had the bleu cheese burger. It bleu.

The fried onion strings they put in it were tough. I felt like I was flossing as I ate. The cheese was, as Stef said, undetectable. The wait, almost impossibly long.  On a Wednesday night. The one perk of working Saturdays off and making Weds my going out night is the small crowds and tiny wait for service. Not here. They're too busy rocking out to Seger to try and provide expedient service. 

The decor? Imagine a party store threw up in Uncle Sam's mouth and he passed out in a birdhouse full of Johnny Rocket's old furniture. Just plain obnoxious. This place was tailor made for Santorum voters. Low brow, not Lowenbrau, and low quality. F your bird mascot. I hope he gets bird flu and gives it to all of your employees."}
{"text":"Worst time ever. Waited forever to order food at the empty bar. The waited 10 minutes to order my drink while part of my party all ready order his drink. Food took over an hour to get even a side. Then when the food came only 2/3 of the order came with like 3 fries on each plate and to top it off that was the extra .99 cents garlic fries, and my burger and fries where so burnt I only took two bits and boxed it and tossed it in the trash at home. They even took food off our check but ended up leaving a two part check combined into one check with the other party's food all for free while I was left with burnt garbage that I paid full for minus my birthday burger. What a great gift from red robins. This is the second time here and they where both terrible. Red robins use to be great now they just expensive burnt burgers."}
{"text":"Blue Ribbon burger is my favorite, but all their burgers are delicious.  I love the bottomless fries they have. You can definitely get fat eating here.  Last time I came here I was seated in a really bright spot of the restaurant which was annoying.  But otherwise this a good Red Robin.  Clean, newer buidling and good service."}
{"text":"Blue Ribbon Burger is amazing.  Add bottomless fries with ranch and you have a perfect meal.  Why don't I eat this everyday? Oh yeah, it would be like that show the Biggest Loser except in reverse."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here once a month. She loves the Banzai burger which is grilled and topped with a teriyaki sauce and pineapple. I always try something new. Service has always been excellent. They also have these machines that make everything, like checkout or adding items, very easy.
There is plenty of sitting room. Never had any problems."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for dinner with a couple of friends and I must say... it was pretty meh. I don't really understand how this chain got as big as it is because it is overpriced and not very good. Plus the 'kitsch' is kind of annoying, right down to all of fake enthusiasm and the names of menu items. I got the potato soup and salad combo (which costs 9$) and the salad was pretty terrible. It looked like they opened a bag of rabbit salad and dumped it on a plate with some cheese on it. The lettuce tasted like it had not been washed. The soup was mediocre, not bad, but not as good as potato soups I have had at other chain restaurants. Oh...and there was a bug on our table. You heard me. A bug. I don't know what it was....but it was a medium sized bug and was kind of gross and unappetizing. I'm not trying to say the place is dirty, because I'm sure every restaurant has had a bug come in...hard to avoid....but I think the place should be maintained enough to keep them off of the tables at least. Anyway, I feel that my money and calories are best spent elsewhere, sorry RR."}
{"text":"Service here is always a hit or miss. Food is usually good.  But I for the life of me don't understand why every single time we come in we ask for fresh hot fries out the fryer and every time they come out cold and yucky.  Then you ask the. Again and they bring you nice and hot fresh fries.  Only other complaint is sitting at the bar you always get this awful smell from their dishwasher.  Makes you think the drains on floor are so dirty or something in washer putting out the smell."}
{"text":"Love the food & service here. Front host and our server/bartender were both very friendly!"}
{"text":"I LOVE RED ROBIN. I sat at the bar and even though they were really busy, I got lots of attention and fresh fries when my original order came out \"crispy.\" The food came out fast. Delicious. That campfire sauce is like crack! I love it."}
{"text":"I am on a low carb diet and figured this spot would be perfect. I ordered the wedge burger and bottomless side salad. My husband also ordered s burger and fries. The table next to us came in after but received their food first. Our burgers and his fries were warm. When server came back to table, I asked for a salad. We finished our food, paid with tablet at the table and server never showed. It was over 20 minutes. And we were the only people left at the bar. So I did not get my salad and he did not get his fries. Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and underportion. When you get there and look through their menu , you see all these amazing looking burgers. When you get your order , buyera remorse. I orded the 15 dollar Black and Bleu burger with bleu cheese and portabello mushroom. When I get it , mushrooms are almost non existent and there is literally half a teaspoon of bleu cheese in the very center. My girlfriend got the Sriracha burger for 6 bucks and it was twice as big as mine. A Jack in the Box gourmet burger is better is better then this place. What is presented to you is a sad misrepresentation of what you get !!"}
{"text":"Man, I had such good memories of Red Robin and the food - now I don't really care to come back. We came for a quick, casual lunch on a Sunday. It was decently busy, but not packed. We were greeted by a young hostess with an attitude who just sat us at a high top in the bar right by the front door without asking if that was ok. I personally hate high tops as they can be uncomfortable for tall people. We went back to ask for a booth as we saw a few available, and she sighed and said that server needed some time before being sat again, we said we would gladly wait. Literally 5 seconds goes by and she grabs menus and told us to follow her. What just happened?

She quickly sat us and sauntered herself and her ponytail back to her perch. Jeez. 

The server was nice enough but could have been a bit more attentive, but we knew she was busy. We ordered a chicken salad and a burger to split. We were really excited for the steak fries, like anyone right?! Not so much, our fries were the first thing we tried and they were cold and rubbery and as we used to call in the restaurant industry \"DEAD\". We asked for new ones, which we got but they almost seemed undercooked this time, but whatever. We ordered the burger medium, it was a little more on medium-well side which was okay but it was cold on the outside. We cut in half and ate it anyway, we weren't going to turn a quick lunch into a whole afternoon sending everything back. The salad was meh, nothing to take a picture of for the menu if you know what I mean. Some looked like' ABC' salad...probably due to being tossed in the dressing and sitting there awhile.We did, however, get numerous refills on our strawberry lemonade from our server which we probably shouldn't have. That drink is SO sweet and unnatural tasting that it made me crave refills on water instead. 

Anywho, I don't normally expect much from family-type-chains but Red Robin used to stand above many of those in my experiences. Seems they have remodeled and restyled quite bit but, well, you come here to eat not admire light fixtures. 

No thanks."}
{"text":"This place is turning to be my favorite burger place! For one it bring back many memories. I've brought my children to Red Robin when it was at Kings Plaza. Now they are grown, so coming to this one in Charlotte reminds me of \"The good 'old days\" . It's a wonderful place, nice variety of burgers, wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not satisfied at all. My family and I were seated at booth/ table 62.... First off the table was dirty.... Secondly the waiter asked for drinks and forgot my sprite. Had to hunt down a host to get one. Then had to ask for silverware and napkins as he ran past. Finally the received our food and I told the pregnant manager that they forgot my black beans. She stated to me that they were in the window and would be right out. We finished our meal and waited. No beans and no follow up. We separated the beans off of our ticket through the machine and left. Wasn't impressed. It wasn't a yummmmm......"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Red Robin's across the U.S.  And this one is consistently bad. Unfortunately the order has been wrong all 4 times. Cooking instructions were not executed, and I was asked my preference, not barking orders. I'm pretty easy going. But I do have food allergies from a disease I'm fighting. The staff was very kind and said they would make sure tomatoes would be clear of our order. Very nice. We waited and waited. Our orders were late every time, cold, overcooked, with tomatoes. Then they weren't very nice or cooperative. No exchanges, refunds, gift cards, Have a Nice Day, Don't Choke, Nothing. Hope it gets better...."}
{"text":"I went to Red Robins twice this past year once for my birthday and another because I wanted a good burger. The servers are always really nice. The manager always checks in or serves the food also. Our food comes out fast and quick. I usually use their machines that's on the table to pay."}
{"text":"Red Robin has a lot of variety in meal choices, but the service has always to be lacking. I had a small portion of fries and once I ran out the waitress 1. didn't bother to ask if I wanted more, and 2. didn't bother to come see if we were okay to begin with. Then didn't ask us if we wanted dessert, and only asked if I wanted more water before dropping the check. If I wanted to be rushed, I would have told her I was in a hurry."}
{"text":"Fofo burgers, Crabcake burger taste like crap! burgers are so so...I tried this place in slumberlin twice already. I'm done. Service suck especially when theyre busy, they don't know hiw to handle pressure, Its a mess."}
{"text":"I went here tonight with my boyfriend. We only go out to eat every so often so this was a little special for us. Our server Sara was attentive, polite, and just overall wonderful. She did a fantastic job. We had an appetizer of pickle nickels and they were very good. Nice breading, salty pickle flavor. My boyfriend and I got the same burger because it just sounded really good: the Prime Chophouse. Burger with mushrooms, crispy onions, horseradish sauce and cheese. Unfortunately, the burger was so salty it was almost unbearble. I could hardly finish it. Barely tasted anything else except for salt. It very disappointing because we only go out on occasion, but I would be willing to come back and give this place another chance sometime. Just not sometime soon because it cost us fourty dollars for two burgers and an appetizer."}
{"text":"I've been to local Red Robin's in the Bay Area and considering that it's a franchise, they make everything the same at all restaurants. Needless to say, this place isn't all that great. I can come here to eat every now and then, but it's not off the wall where I tend to want to come back more than often.

We ordered an onion ring tower which was HUGE! and ok tasting. I'm not much of a onion ring lover and that might have an impact on why I didn't think it tasted great. Me and the wifey also shared a chicken pasta which wasn't all that tasty in my opinion, probably won't ever order it again. But what I do like about this place is their fish, fries and shrimp sampler appetizer, although we didn't order it at the time we came to this place, I did have it a few times when coming to another Red Robin and I do recommend it to others when coming here.

All in all this place doesn't deserve more than 3 stars as food wasn't that great here when we ate. Sorry Red Robin I just know you can do better."}
{"text":"This actually deserves 0 stars as we never even got waited on.  Sat for 10 minuets and not one person came by.  They were not fully busy either.  So very disappointing!  Poor poor service"}
{"text":"Now that RR has revamped their menu, their offerings are much more palatable.  Brian P. likes to come here thanks to their rewards program so I've tried everything from their salads to their burgers. While everything tastes fine, there's nothing to write home about.

My biggest gripe is how cramped everything is. I can't cross my legs at the table without blocking the flow of traffic. Staff were bumping into me while I was seated. The tables are just way too close together. Luckily nothing spilled on me. 

While I'll probably get flak for this, as a non tattooed person, I'm going to mention it. The staff looks wrecked here, which doesn't instill confidence in me. If you wanna tat your face, cool, but cover that up for food service. Neck tats, breast tats, back tats and sleeves that are hanging out. Why are staff wearing clothing that shows of back tats and breast tats in a restaurant? This isn't Coyote Ugly. The tats and lack of grooming  standards looks unkempt. 

Service is okay. Refills of water and bottomless items are hard to come by so meh, this place is just ok."}
{"text":"This location was renovated last year and it looks awesome. It's a lot more modern than it used to be and they have little tablets at each table that allows you to order your appetizers, play games, and pay your bill if you're paying with credit card. I had to wait over 10 minutes for someone to come to our table, even though the server came and said he would be with is in a second, he ended up helping all of these other tables and forgot about us. We stopped someone to get our server and it happened to be the manager. After that, we were helped right away and we were given another server. The customer service was flawless after that. Food is always great. I've never ordered something from here that I didn't like. I only give it 4 stars because of the rocky start, but other than that it was great."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before choosing this place. Shame on me.

I felt like we were at a day care facility that happened to serve awesome burgers. Crying babies, unruly toddlers, older children literally running down the aisles, inattentive parents and unbelievable amount of NOISE. Unfortunately no matter how tasty and reasonably priced their burgers are, we will never return to this locale. 

Not slamming the establishment, just letting others know."}
{"text":"We usually go to Red Robin every couple months. Haven't been to this location in about a year. Our server was very good. Our drinks never ran dry. We had a party of 5. We waited 45 minutes for our order. Ok maybe the kitchen was short staffed. After 45 minutes we get our food. The chili on top of my chilli burger was ice cold. 3 out of 5 peoples fries were cold. Sent my burger back. Waited another 15 minutes while everyone at the table ate. She brought fresh fries over several times. While i waited for my burger i ran to the restroom. It has the potential to be a nice restroom but needs a good scrubbing. I walked past the ice room. Eeeww gross. I know the ice machine needs to drain. But there was ice and water all over the floor. Once i saw all that i started noticing everything else. It was 7pm on a saturday but there was so much food on the floor around tables. No one could sweep as they cleared a table? As i ran my hand along the window i realize there's a greasy film that the dust is sticking to. This place needs a good scrub down with degreaser. Won't be back to this location. Waiting on RR to call me back. I wish I would have taken pictures."}
{"text":"Closest Red Robin to my house and always super slow!!! Car side is frequently 30 minutes late and if you come in person get ready to wait an hour for your food."}
{"text":"worst seating and management  ever.. with 25 tables available 3 families waiting to sit trash everywhere and still have to wait 30 mins? sorry you just lost $120 sale for a family of 5."}
{"text":"Red Robin is a once or twice a month regular for us.  Especially because of there club card which gives you every 10th burger for FREE!
Ignacio always goes for the Guacamole burger here on a Jalapeno bun and Uriel always gets the Burnin Love Burger on a Jalapeno bun.  Me, I love the fish & chips.  The frys here are nice crispy fat steak frys and we love em.  Ask for some before your meal and they will keep them coming free of charge.
Ocassionaly we run in to a service problem as this is a pretty busy mall location but a quick run down of the manager solves the problem,  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favorite go-to for a solid gourmet burger and bottomless broccoli and sweet potato fries! I never tried this place until I moved to Charlotte and now it's the only chain I visit when I don't know what else I want to eat."}
{"text":"This particular location is inside the Galleria Mall, however there is an outside entrance if you do not desire to walk through the entire mall to get here. On this occasion, there were only two of us and upon checking in we were told there would be a 20-25 minute wait. (Lunchtime) The hostess who checked us in was polite enough, however the second hostess , Champagne or Charmagne was openly annoyed and I witness her impatient eye rolls and attitude towards other guests. There were several empty, yet dirty tables that had not been attended to , for which I assumed contributed to the longer wait time. I did notice that the hostess were both doing their part in helping with the cleaning of said tables, however leaving people confused as to where they were and where they were to check in at. Once they called our name, we were led to the back of the restaurant near the cooking area. Right away, I was completely annoyed. As I looked around he area, all I noticed were large parties. (6, 9, 8, etc) One particular party was a group of 20, which were over the top loud and being openly obnoxious. As our waiter approached I started looking around at possible other seating options, however empty tables in view were still dirty. I paused a moment before accepting that we may just have to make the best of it. Our waiter, Mackenzie, was great and did his best to make be as attentive as possible. Waiting for our food, however, the noise level became too much and my annoyance took over. Why should a party of 2 have to be subjected to such a ridiculous scene. The hostess should ask a smaller party if they want to be seated in an area that they typically seat larger parties, I couldn't even have a conversation if I want to someone sitting across the table from me! If I would have been given a choice, I most definitely would have waited for a different table! Once the food came, I had all but lost my appetite and picked at my Caesar wrap, which was bland and unspectacular. At this point, I just wanted to get the hell out of here! As we waited for the check, wouldn't you know, some of the party of 20 started to trickle out, choosing to stand by our table to finish conversations and laugh...hitting our chairs and table numerous times. I'm disappointed at the waiters and the manager for not asking these guests to keep their banter and obnoxious laughs to a reasonable degree as well, every guest deserves to have an enjoyable dine in meal. With the wait to be seated and the time it took to get our meal, were here close to 1:45 minutes. I will not return to this location, the organization of the establishment is not worth the headache or the wasted time. My two stars are for our poor waiter, he did a great job in what was I'm sure a stressful situation for him as well!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times over the years and have always had a great dining experience. This particular occasion, we dined in for lunch. We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken. The only thing to frown upon during this visit was the taste of the sweet tea..regular tea was made to be \"sweet\" by the addition of something in the restaurant. Same thing with the raspberry tea..they add raspberry flavor to regular tea. Once drinks were brought to the table, our order was taken. We were pleasantly surprised when our food was delivered what seemed like moments after ordering. All food ordered was delicious! Our waitress and manager checked on us several times, which was appreciated. We love that you can also pay your bill at the table and split the checks if needed. Thanks Red Robin for the great service as always!"}
{"text":"*Customer Service 1/2 Stars, I go here frequently as I love Red Robin and how you can have a nice little dinner at an affordable price. The customer service here has been a hit or miss but overall either average or above average each time. 

*Experience 1/1 Star, Haven't had a bad experience here as the only issue I've had was the long wait to even get our drinks do to a new server that forgot about our table to begin with but it was recovered by another server who noticed and she took very good care of us and made sure we had everything we needed along with an apology for the wait. 

*Food 1/1 Star, Food is good here and very much affordable. I always tend to get the burgers here and really enjoy the tavern double! 

*Would I Recommend 1/1 Star, Yes I would recommend you go here and take your family out to enjoy yourselves."}
{"text":"Just tried this location for the first time on Saturday. VERY busy, but the wait was actually not bad. However, it was a very hit or miss experience for me.

Pros:

Everyone was very friendly, host guy was GREAT, waiter was nice and the manager who came over was also.

Burgers were good as usual. Cheese sticks and onion rings were also good.

Cons: 

Service was pretty so-so. The kitchen seemed chaotic, and they were apparently having a very difficult time getting fries out.

Our waiter seemed great in the beginning, but forgot about us soon after, and was frazzled once we tracked him down. We asked a couple times for refills on drinks and fries. Drink refills came after a manager was involved (see below) and fry refill never came. Fry thing really bugged my husband as he asked for extra fries (which did come with the appetizers)  and mentioned to the waiter that he would eat a lot of refills, even as he ordered, so the fact that he didn't get one, was irritating. 

Our daughters meal was wrong, and we had to send it back which prompted a manager to come over. He asked how everything was (he was very nice!) and we mentioned the lack of refills, very shortly after, the waiter brought them and mentioned they were on the way as the manager came to ask for them, and seemed irritated we \"told\" on him, I guess?? It was awkward. 

Lastly, we got a pretzel bites appetizer which was TERRIBLE, tasteless, full of weird brown grease, and just YUCK. However, the manager took those off the bill for us, which was very nice. 

So overall, while it seems like it was a more negative experience, the great host, manager, decent waiter, and burgers brought it up to 3 stars for me. Hopefully, they will get better about handling the crowds over there!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here 2 nights ago around 9PM and it was my best experience yet. We came in and instantly got greeted by our seater, I forgot what our servers name was but she was the best! Usually when I go to a Red Robin in a different location it takes forever for them to bring me what I need whether it be napkins, campfire or ranch sauce, or a refill on my bottomless lemonade! But I can't stress enough about how my server was on top of everything! I didn't need to ask for anything at all. She brought like 5 napkins right off the bat, the shortie rings with ranch and campfire sauce and then another ranch and campfire sauce when our burgers came. The thing I noticed the most though was when I ordered the strawberry lemonade it came in a curvy glass and when she brought me a refill without me asking it was in a huge glass! That's never happened before because at other locations I would just get a refill on the curvy glass but I wasn't complaining! ^-^ the manager even stopped by to ask us how we were doing and if she could get us anything and got us our 3rd refill! So basically, we will not only be coming here because it's the nearest one to us, but for the great service and all the kind employees! 

+ I recommend anyone who loves red robin as much as I do to get a red robin royalty card!

{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon with friends. The four of us were seated immediately and soon greeted by our waitress. She told us about all the specials for that day as we browsed through the menu. The \"Burning Love\" burger caught my eye. This is a gourmet burger topped with fried jalapeño coins, tangy salsa, pepper-jack, tomatoes and chipotle aioli on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll. 
My burger was out in a reasonable amount of time. It love at first bite. just as they say. Cooked to perfection and bursting with bold flavors I enjoyed every bite until the bun fell apart. I don't think the cornmeal bun could handle the sauce and juiciness of the burger. I finished it with a fork. The fries that came with my order were good but unremarkable. 
This just qualifies to appear on my \"Best Burger\" list. If the bun would have held up it may have even scored a 5."}
{"text":"This visit was a take out order, so a friend and I sat at the bar waiting for our food to come out. The bartender was a friendly lady, she took our order and brought us some water while we waited.

It took a little while for our food to come out, once it did, I asked for a side of sauce for the fries. She said she'd be right back with the 1,000 island. It took FOREVER for her to come back with a small container of dressing. We joked that she had to go collect all 1,000 islands for us.

We got back to the house after a while and we were all finally able to eat.

We normally have good experiences at this location, as we eat there semi-regularly. The bartender was not busy making drinks while we waited, it seemed almost as if she took her break, then remembered to bring us the side so we could leave."}
{"text":"I am going to give our server the benefit of the doubt, because it was a busy night and maybe he was just \"off.\"

I've been here quite a few times, and never leave disappointed.  This time was no exception (other than a small snafu with the service).

They have a new addition to their menu, where they are offering small plates at different price points.  We decided to share the wedge salad for $3.  It was small, but since we were ordering meals, it was perfect to share and really good!  I also received a beer, which I never received (more on that later).

My Mom had the seafood platter, which was surprisingly REALLY good.  The clams were perfect, as were the shrimp and cod.  We would definitely order this again, and it was reasonably priced at $13.99 (a lot of food).

I had the patty melt.  It was good - nothing too exciting, but it's hard to really screw up a patty melt.  I love that they serve thousand island dressing on the side - more places should do so.  

When our food was delivered, our server also brought a 3rd entree, which we didn't order.  When we told him this, he said that I ordered the \"Oktoberfest,\" to which I explained that I ordered the BEER, not another burger.  What kind of fat asses does he think we are?! Haha...anyhow, he took the extra burger away, removed the charge from our bill and brough my beer, so all was well.

Prices are decent, and I like that you get bottomless fries.  Also, the freckled (strawberry) lemonade is refreshing and good.

This isn't someplace to go out of your way for, but if you are hungry and in the mall, it's worth a stop!"}
{"text":"I am a fan! This is the location nearest to our house and we've never had a bad experience. This is a great place to go when you are looking for a reasonably priced variety. They are most known for their burgers, but have many other offerings as well.

I joined their loyalty program awhile ago because they give you a free burger on your birthday every year. This program is pretty great - I am regularly receiving discounts, BOGO burgers and other offers. They keep track of your purchases and every 10th burger is free. I love the freckled lemonade, they have awesome shakes and you can also get bottomless root beer floats for only $4.99. Add that to their bottomless steak fries and you've got a winning combination!

The service can be hit or miss, but it hasn't really been a big deal. We always enjoy our visits there and it tends to be the place we go when we can't really decide on anywhere specific."}
{"text":"Had a really nice lunch today. Sarah was my server and he did great. Nick was managing and checked on us twice to make sure everything was good. Great experience."}
{"text":"Done done and done. Love the burgers HATE THE SERVICE. Went in today for a birthday burger. I was seated quickly and proceeded to sit. 20 minutes later still sitting , finally they brought me my drink at 30 minutes watched people who came in way after me were being brought drinks and food. Last three attempts to eat here have miserably failed. The manager needs to go train at the LBC location."}
{"text":"Sadly this isn't a well managed Red Robin. The hamburger wasn't as good as other Red Robin's (tasted like it was flame broiled at Burger King), fries weren't hot (tasted like they had been sitting out for awhile) and fruit was mushy, not fresh. Not a very clean restaurant either (crumbs all over floor and booth seats). Bummed!!! 

Positives: The lower carb options menu section. 

Save your money and go to Mimi's next door."}
{"text":"The Royal Red Robin burger is the best, it's a great burger WITH a fried egg on it, could it get any better?
Fun, family style restuarant"}
{"text":"This place is always clean and the staff are always friendly and polite. The food is good and the service is great. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and speedy service."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday, we were told there would be a 45 min wait (it looked like there were a couple of parties going on). Then she mentioned we could be seated immediately on the patio. We went with that. It wasn't too hot in the shade, and they had misters. The bonus in sitting outside is that it wasn't loud,  and wet could actually talk and hear each other. Win-win. 

Service was prompt,  even being outside my water stayed filled. 

Food: they have amazing onion rings,  tasty with good ranch. We all had burgers. 

Black and blue: perfect amount of blue cheese,  not overwhelming. It was ordered medium,  but came well done. 

Pepper and smoke: So salty, dad couldn't finish it.

Royal red robin: this comes with a sunny-side up egg. I didn't realize when I ordered it that the patty was smaller than the \"special\" burgers on a different page. The patty was really thin, compared to everyone else's burger. When I ordered it medium-rare, I was told that the best they could do was medium. I was bummed,  but at least mine was cooked correctly. I was warned that the sunny-side up egg may be undercooked. It was. A big chunk of clear, uncooked egg white fell from the center as I bit into it. I laughed at the irony that they would serve uncooked eggs, but not a medium-rare burger. :/

I loved the thick steak fries. They have some inventive desserts I'd like to try someday."}
{"text":"I've been to this Red Robin twice, once for lunch and another time just for drinks. I wouldn't usually go to Red Robin for drinks but it was a large party of people and a few of them didn't have their ID so we weren't able to go to the establishment we had initially intended to but I digress. I usually order the Red Robin Royale burger or the chicken sandwich with the teriyaki sauce and pineapple, or sometimes my husband and I order one of each and split them. When we came here for lunch I remember my sandwich being extra messy and difficult to eat because of all the sauce but the flavor was on point. I have no complaints about the customer service here. Their bathrooms are always clean when I go however the stalls are rather small which makes it extra cramped in there when there's a line of women and you're trying to squeeze out of the stall closest to the door. This Red Robin isn't the closest one to my apartment but I much prefer it over the one that is so I have no problem returning to this location."}
{"text":"I had never been to Red Robin at any location. Since, it opened in Champaign, I always wanted to try it. But, I was little skeptical after reading reviews. Considering it is always jam packed, I decided to give take out a try. I ordered the garden burger and onion rings to go. My food took 40 minutes to arrive, which is a pretty long time for a burger and onion rings. Still, I was patient. There was no apology, nothing for the delay. That's why, took two stars.
On the other hand, food tasted good. Onion rings were good and so was the dipping sauce. Burger was good but I wished the patty had a crust. Also, an addition of coleslaw would have been great. 
I will try it again, considering the food tasted good. I hope, next time I wouldn't have to wait so long."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great experience. It's definitely busy and I wouldn't go there if you're looking for a \"quiet\" date night. Lots of loud kids, however....the bar area is 21 and up with is very nice. Our bartender/server was a super cool guy. We enjoyed out food. I ordered fried pickles, onion rings and French onion soup and my husband ordered some kind of burger with an egg on top. All very delicious!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a party of 10 to celebrate my birthday. We got seated promptly and the server was polite and that is about where it ends. Half of the table got their drinks right away, the rest of us had to wait 40 minutes! I ordered a frozen Margarita and it was half melted and tasted like they forgot the alcohol ( sent that back ). When the food came out the fries were ice cold and everyone's burgers were burnt. They were actually black and charcoal like, so were the buns. My mother sent hers back and I think they brought out the same burger cause it was just as bad. Asked for more french fires and they came out after everyone was done. Finally, it took almost 1/2 hr. to get the check. No manager ever came over, no apologizes of any kind. Love Red Robin.....just not this one!!! STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Literally just left the restaurant, and was compelled to write this review while my dad is driving my mother and I home. We were seated in the bar and Marco, the bartender waited on us. The whole time he acted as if we were such an inconvenience- he was not friendly, he seemed distracted, and it was a struggle to be able to get his attention to ask for anything. Once we were finally able to flag him down, my mother asked for more fries, but before I could even request anything, he already bolted off. It was like pulling teeth to get any service from this guy, he never asked how everything was, never offered refills, and he barely listened or acknowledged when we did ask for anything. Mind you, there was one other couple in the whole room- it wasn't busy, so I don't know what this guy's deal was. We finally paid and got up to leave and he practically glared at me while we were leaving. Thanks, man. I've never felt so uncomfortable having dinner with my parents in my life. You really shouldn't be working in customer service with that bad attitude and arrogant personality. I've never written a bad review before, but this experience really pushed me to it. I even called the restaurant back just to find out this guy's name. I love Red Robin, but this experience was crap."}
{"text":"Not a good visit today at Red Robin's. The service was slow and unattentive. 

We did final get the fries...after we finished our meals. Time to start looking for a new hamburger place."}
{"text":"I've been twice and I don't see they hype. The burger is just a over done frozen patty. There is way better places in town to get a real burger. No plans on going back."}
{"text":"Had the marco polo chicken breast sandwich and the flavors dazzled me taste buds.  Love the mushroom burger and the veggie and turkey burgers.  They do burgers well.  Nice sides, E.g., onion rings, sweet potato fries, campfire sauce, etc.  Reasonably priced w/ terrific service.  Substitutions are liberally allowed and menu has lots of choices.  Family friendly."}
{"text":"I like Red Robin burgers including its garden burger.  I like the ambiance of this location and the service took it up a notch.  The fries, including sweet potato ones, are very good and I like the Red Robin spice jar.  However, this restaurant is a little on the pricey side without getting any drinks.  A gourmet burger is like the one Ramsey Clark does at Planet Hollywood.  Red Robin is not up to that standard but it's very good."}
{"text":"My wife and I took my father here for dinner. We live between this one and the one at arrowhead. This one is just a little closer. When we arrived at the restaurant hosts told us we had to wait. There was 2 people in front us. The hostess then turned her back on the waiting area. After about 5 min the hostess took the name of all parties waiting. Why would you not take the names right away if you have people waiting. We were told it would be 15 min. My father went to the restroom located at the back of the restaurant upon coming back he informed us that over have the place was empty with no one seating at the tables. After waiting about 30 min and watching two group of people leave we were final seated at a table that had been empty since we had walked into the restaurant. After placing our order the manager brought onion rings to use. After eating about half the onion rings they took them from our table saying it was a mistake and we were not suppose to receive them. What were they going to do with the rest? Serve them to someone else? Food was good but service we received will guarantee we will not be visiting this location again. We will be making the longer drive to arrowhead from now on."}
{"text":"1st time here 
Ordered the ghost burger add guacamole.  Mango margarita.  Bar out or mango. So went for the mai tai
Burger arrived no guacamole   Waitress no where to be found.  Needed more water.  Do the waitress comes back i inform her no guacamole. I've eaten more than half and she brings the side of guacamole. Kinda late if you ask me.  Fries are good"}
{"text":"Red Robin never disappoints. After the fiasco of a dinner last night, we came to a place we know. Although it was extremely busy, we were seated in less than the quoted time. In fact it wasn't even 5 minutes when we were quoted 20.  Their food is always consistent. Busy-yes; loud-yes.  But their service is on point and their food is good as always. He owner is walking around, engaging customers and helping where needed. People coming in and out and everyone is excited about their experience, including us. We will definitely come back! Even on a busy night they still take care of their customers. Black and Blue burger is the tops!! So good!"}
{"text":"Whoever is managing red Robin currently, should be issued an award. My son and I came in for lunch to cheer him up after finding out he has myalgia and cannot play sports for quite some time. He was having a terrible day. From calling on the phone, to find out if the outdoor seating was open, to entering the restaurant we were greeted with enthusiasm and a smile that made us feel so welcomed. The new menu is incredible, with many different cheese features and a new burger that is a must try it with macaroni and cheese on it. The host was especially accommodating and sweet as he greeted us with a huge smile. The server, Liz, was fast attentive, and had a wonderful personality. I then noticed that the manager was very visible and present in the restaurant, even helping to host and server with their jobs. When I pulled her over to commend her staff and restaurant operation, she was so sweet and took the time to talk to my son about his experience at the restaurant and how he is feeling. The difference in this restaurant from what we have previously experienced is incredible. If you have not tried Monroeville Red Robin, or had a bad experience previously, please give it another chance as we will definitely be back regularly. The difference between red Robin and Burgatory in value, staff, and food quality, is remarkable and there is no contest to the fact that we will be choosing this red robin from here on out."}
{"text":"I live right by this location..ran in for a quick burger.

The hostess essentially yelled at us because we were going to walk into the bar to seat ourselves. Not a good way to start.

The service was slow and the food was average. FIVE guys across the parking lot would have been much better.

On top of the bad service and average food the bathroom and the space itself were not well maintained for a restaurant that has been opened since what..November?

Clean the bathroom and get the kitchen grease off the floor.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"I am a fan! This place is always fabulous. The food is good and the burgers are some of the best in the valley, especially for a chain restaurant. The meet is good and the breakers are filling with the right ratio of all of the toppings. The buns are the right size and there is no masking a mediocre burger with too much bread - everything is excellent. 

The staff is extraordinarily friendly and always go out of their way to make sure any special requests are taken care of. The kids love all the decorations and the video games on the table don't hurt either! You can now pay at the table also, which is very neat."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan, but my husband whats his burger with egg...YUCK!  Although now he doesn't eat meat, so he opted for the patty melt with the meat patty substitute....defeats the purpose of going their at all."}
{"text":"This place is usually awesome but our service tonight was very poor. We could hardly understand our server and she screwed up our order on more than one account. Always ask for Glenn he's the best they've got!"}
{"text":"The giant cockroach crawling down the wall did nothing for our appetite, especially after watching a server smash it into the wall. The way that they handled it afterwards was even worse. After asking for the manager twice...the server gives us our bill to go along with the side of cockroach. After, the manager finally comes over and we had to  ask if they are really going to charge us for our meal....he agrees to credit our meal. No one seemed to think that one of the nastiest bugs crawling down the wall was that big of a deal. If they have them crawling on their wall in the dining room, who knows what is in their kitchen! Disgusting. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Right off the bat the staff completely ignored our presence, after a little wait at the front (we were the only ones there) we were seated. The back of the booths were extremely dirty, food was scattered on the floor under our table. The restaurant itself was dirty. We ordered our drinks and ended up waiting a long while for those as well. Food came out and everything looked fine, my daughter enjoyed her meal but my burger which had an egg on it was less than pleasing. The egg was way past under cooked, there was a glob of egg white on my plate, which can was uncooked. We requested to talk to the manager and when we told him off the raw egg he completely blew it off. Highly unsatisfied. Would not return."}
{"text":"What's not to like? The fish n chips, AMAZING. The pretzel bites, Outstanding. The booze, WOW. Don't forget the burgers. I like the RED ROYAL ROBIN. Delicious. Easily my favorite upper scale burger place."}
{"text":"Called my order in was great thy gave me the extra fries and lots of ranch even in my to go order. I was very happy with the service told my co worker and we ordered the Next day ordered online had a few orders thy barely gave me extra fries ranch and no ketchup.  They also didn't give me utensils the order wasn't ready I had to go inside to get my order whn requested curb side pick up"}
{"text":"I rarely order alcohol but the Sangria photo looks appealing and I've had some fabulous Sangria across the country.

With that being said, the manager (Blake) stopped by shortly after I began my meal, to ask how everything was. I said their signature cheeseburger and fries were great but mentioned that the Sangria was not so great. I had consumed about a third of the Sangria and it just tasted like flavored water.

He simply said \"I'm sorry\" and walked away. I always give management a chance to make it right. I ALWAYS mention the result of that, good or bad.

Nick, my waiter was great and I let him know that I wasn't happy and that I did food reviews for a hobby.

The manager stopped back by and said he never \"comps\" alcohol. He said I had consumed most of it, which I did, but had he offered a replacement (or something) the first go around, I probably would have left happier.

I've had alcoholic beverages with meals before, that were \"off\", and management has always made it right.

I'll probably come back because the food is great. I'll pass on the alcohol next time."}
{"text":"I came here Friday afternoon with my friend for lunch and the service and food was just amazing!  My friend had ordered the cheese melt thinking it was a hamburger.  When they brought it out, my friend had said that it wasn't what she thought it was(my friends mistake, not red robins)  and the waitress let her order something else.  Her second order came out really fast and they had refilled our drinks and fries quickly too.  I have been to this location a few times and the service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"We all know this is your average burger chain. Not bad/not excellent but decent. The endless fries are insane. I just don't know how anyone has room in their stomachs for all of those fries. I like the service at the Monroeville location."}
{"text":"I am normally a fan of Red Robin but after this experience I will definitely not go back to this location. We arrived late for lunch, probably around 1 pm. It was not very busy but the servers were rushing around and it took a while for ours to come up. They seemed very under staffed. I ordered a draft beer and water. My wife ordered a strawberry lemonade and water. It took about 10 minutes to get the waters and lemonade, and then the server told me they no longer carried the seasonal summer ale, in May. I picked a different one but heard another server telling a table next to us they were out of some other draft beer. After we ordered our burgers it took about 20 minutes to get our food. After I  took a bite I  realized that it wasn't what I ordered. After another 10 minutes of no server I went to the host stand and told the hostess. She came back and looked and confirmed that it definitely wasn't what I ordered and took it back to the manager. Then she came and apologized. A few minutes later our server came back and apologized. I said it was ok and asked for mayo. The entire time my wife had not taken a bite because she wanted mayo, and had been waiting about 15 minutes at this point. Another 5 minutes or so later i got the correct burger from the manager, who also apologized. At this point I was frustrated but they whole staff was very nice and as I mentioned, I suspected they were under staffed, so I said it was no problem. That's when it all turned way worse. 
We finished our food and the server stopped by. my wife asked for a to-go box. She brought it right  away. Another 10 minutes later she came back and asked if we wanted anything else before we left. I told her we were good for our check. She said ok and went to the table next to us and offered them their check. A few minutes later she brought them their check and then asked the table on the other side of us if they wanted their check. Another few minutes goes by and she comes out with theirs, then walked away. My wife was furious so we just went to pay on the table kiosk. It was then that we saw that we were charged for all 3 burgers. The server originally put in the wrong one. After another 10 minutes of not seeing our server or the manager, we manually split the check on the table kiosk and paid our portion, then left. 
I'm still fairly certain they were under staffed, at least when we got there. By the time we left, which was at least 90 minutes later, if not more, there were at least 3 more servers that I did not originally see. But I now also think that the staff was not very familiar with their food or drink menus. The manager did make a correction and apologized, but no one offered anything to make up for it and didn't even care enough to fix the check. That, coupled with barely being available on the floor demonstrates that customer service is not much of a priority. The food was good, but you can get a good burger other places too, without waiting way too long or trying to track down an employee."}
{"text":"I haven't had a good meal here in quite awhile... And yet I keep stupidly coming back.
This time my meal was fine but the two people I came with had major issues; one persons burger was dry and tiny and the other persons burger had paper on it. When she asked for a new one they brought the old one out with new cheese on it. Don't get the orange cream soda, it reminds me of orange medicine"}
{"text":"Waste of your money there's gristle in the chicken. The fries were greasy. It is so loud in here you can't even talk. They keep singing happy happy birthday every five fucking minutes. Two people haveing a birthday .They don't have fresh coffee in the evenings. Red Robin sucks
If you look in the back window where employees go and just off the back parking lot you'll never want to eat there again in your life there's trash and stuff all over it is absolutely disgusting an absolute health hazard in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love this Red Robin location! We always get really good service and I love how they cater to vegans. You can subtitle a Bocca burger (or garden burger) on any of their burgers free of charge. I also LOVE the bottomless fries, they're SO GOOD! 

I usually get a Bocca burger with pineapple, teriyaki, avocado and wrapped in lettuce   It's really really good!

Shout out to Brent...he is an awesome server and always makes sure we are taken care of."}
{"text":"Worst experience we have ever had. Will never come back to red robin again. Came in and ordered an appetizer which we never received. Manager took it off the bill but did not inquire about why we were clearly upset. Server never checked in to see if food was ok. Menus stayed on the table the entire time. Plates were never pre bussed. The absolute WORST EVER. Red Robin has lost a customer."}
{"text":"Onion ring appetizer was very good
The Royal Red Robin is always my go-to meal and it always satisfies. 

Wedgie burger was also good if that's what you're interested in."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day with my fiancé and we were highly disappointed with this location. Burgers were overly greasy and the fried pickles were a joke!"}
{"text":"We had the Whiskey BBQ burgers and they were very good. The fries were plentiful and tasty. Very nice and competent server. I got a free burger for my birthday."}
{"text":"Red Robin has good burgers, but the one star is based on their service. I ate there at 7:30pm on a weekday. The hostess sat us a table top in the bar area, when the restaurant was not busy at all. The problem was the service in the bar area. We waited 35 minutes for our burgers to arrive at our table. They were luke warm and so were the fries, the fries were also the bottom of the bag fries, the ones you can't eat. During our 30 minute wait the waiter did not check on us after she dropped off our drinks. Everyone else in the restaurant, even people that arrived after us, had their food delivered to them. 
The one in Eastern is 100 times better than this location."}
{"text":"Love the sweet potato fries here, it's worth the upgrade! I always get either the mushroom burger, royal red robin, or the regular chicken sandwich. I love how they cook my burger med rare, and the strawberry lemonade, or the flavored teas go great with the burgers. If you're extra hungry, try the stacked onion rings, but don't forget the fries are bottomless, and really yummy. There can be a long wait some nights, but Never too bad. :)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. 

What we sampled: 
The Onion Ring Tower (delicious I really liked the campfire sauce) 
Prime Chophouse Burger (decent, but overall meh as yelp would put it)
Steak Fries (I usually hate steak fries to I will say these were great) 

Overall it was decent for lunch, but I don't love chains so I would rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We went there for their Jim's day (my husband is Jim); and why not get a free burger? haha
It was our first time in this location, and I was impressed with the decor and the neatness of the place. Our server was great; she was attentive and very friendly.
I did have to return the turkey burger, because it was so over salted my mouth was hurting from one bite. And I actually like salty food and never returned a turkey burger in my life.
The server was absolutely fine with the return and quickly brought me another dish I ordered.
Overall nice experience and I'd go back there again if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I would give them more stars, but unlimited fries are a bunch bologna. We asked for fries before the burgers came and more after they came. The waitress brought out one extra basket right before we were already to leave. From now on we are going to tell the server if she/he doesn't bring us the unlimited fries we request, then she/he will not be getting any tip. We normally tip about 25% and have tipped as much as 50%. So we are not cheap with our tipping, but Red Robin's is cheap with their French fries! As far as their food goes, it's good."}
{"text":"My server was pretty wonderful. She told us about the happy hour and when we ordered just one appetizer, she told us it'd be like $2 more for another one ($5 deal for two appetizers).

We got the jalapeno coins (which I will probably get again next time I'm back) and the onion rings. Both were actually pretty good. I probably enjoyed those more than my burger and garlic fries.

I used to come here years ago for garlic fries but it doesn't seem up to par this time. Granted, it's been a few years, or maybe they were kind of soggy or maybe the appetizers filled me up already. It just didn't taste quite the same.

I split the burger (prime chophouse?) with my friend cause we can't finish one whole burger. To be honest, we didn't even finish our half burger nor our fries. The drinks and appetizers get to me every time!"}
{"text":"Bree our server did a fantastic job. A great place to get a big meal for a great price."}
{"text":"It's a two star because the server tried real hard. Read the review by Bryan M. We went there together. A few things he didn't mention was how lazy the bartender is and the left over food left in the cracks of the table. Ewww... I would Skip this location."}
{"text":"This store is a mess, dirty tables everywhere. We ordered and have been waiting for 45 minutes,  still no food. Other tables that were seated 20 minutes after us have food. It took the hostess 15 minutes to greet us. Bathrooms look like a tornado hit them. Manager just apologized they lost our order. Our awesome server did not notice, just kidding she it s not awesome. Not sure what else to say still sitting waiting for food, looking at trash all over the floor.
Food just came out, forgot the fries. How do you burn a burger you forgot to make? 
Manager offered to take 50% off, I told him I was not willing to pay that much. The entire experience sucked!
Never again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while on a business trip in the Monona area. No wait over the lunch hour and our waiter got us in and out in a timely fashion. 

I decided to order the soup and salad combo, because I needed warmed up from the COLD weather. I went for the chicken tortilla soup and a BBQ chicken wrap. Good quality and decent price."}
{"text":"Nope, never again. I got a bloody burger!!!! Why? Is well done so difficult??? On top of that, it's a cramped place. They are trying to fit far too many tables into square footage that makes it feel cramped, uncomfortable, and stifling. On a positive, and my only reason for the one star is the drinks were good and our server was awesome. 
Still won't come back, though."}
{"text":"Love Red Robin. They have a great selection of burgers and kids meals. I love there French fries. Service at this location is always great. We had a slight glitch with our order this past visit and the manager took care of it right away. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was not the greatest and the service was extremely slow.  My husband and I ordered clam chowder with our meals and when it came out it was like milk broth.  There were no chunks of potato or clams.  The manager took the soup back and gave us a different soup.  The replacement was not the greatest in taste. The best I could say was that the manager tried to make it right by comping some of our food.  I really was hoping for good food not money off of our order."}
{"text":"This restaurant is trying to kill me. If you have a food allergy, don't eat here. One more than one occasion I have foolishly ordered takeout from this restaurant. I have a lot of foods that I can't eat, and I always clearly mark the order as \"allergy\", removing any foods from the item that I can't have. Without fail, every single time, the order is wrong. Either we're standing in the restaurant, fighting with them to remake it. Or we are on the phone screaming at them after we've had to throw food in the garbage. Avoid this place like the plague. I wouldn't eat here again if they paid ME to be a customer."}
{"text":"The place was not clean. The waiter was a new hire but the food lacked taste."}
{"text":"Literally when I say this is the worst Red Robin I have ever been to, I mean it. Now my friends & I live far away from Red Robin so when one is in sight, you best know we are going to eat at one. Well, when we got to this Red Robin the place wasn't busy at all and had so many open tables so we got excited that there wouldn't be a wait, as we were going to go shopping after. We did not see anybody at the host stand for a good ten minutes until it what it looked like the manager came and told us that it would be a 10-15 minute wait.. with how many tables open we didn't understand why there was a wait. As more people came in, the wait got longer, and more than 15 minutes had gone by. Finally, we were seated about 25 minutes later and we were very \"hangry\". Our waitress came took our orders - to sum it up we waited 10 minutes to even get our waters, there was 3 servers total on the floor, and the service was just about awful. Even to mention there was some kind of unknown goo in my friends campfire sauce and we she asked for another one, THE MANAGER brought another one with the same goo in it. So gross. In conclusion; giving this place a 1 star only because I love bottomless fries and they were about the only thing good about this experience."}
{"text":"Great burgers! I signed up for a royalty card and got a free burger for my birthday! They have a ton of different burgers for any budget, from the cheap tavern burgers at $6.99, or the finest black angus burgers for $14.99. 

Oh and don't forget to try the onion rings with the campfire sauce. It's an orange-ish color, but it is liquid GOLD!! 

You're welcome."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for lunch not too long ago and we were enjoying our talks and our drinks. We had already ordered and were just waiting for it to be boughten out. When it did come out the manager himself came and talked to us saying the food took too long to cook. We didnt notice nor cared. But he said it didn't meet standards so our whole meal was free. It was a pleasant dining experience and I will definitely be back more"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and recently the service has been absolutely terrible. We asked for the fries while waiting for drinks, Brian brought us 8 fries in a basket. So we asked for refills and waited a long time for them. He said he was new, but he forgot a lot of stuff we needed. Our food was the only thing good! We won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This location keeps going down hill in customer service and the speed of their service.  Sad part is this the only closest location to my house.  Don't think I will be back at all."}
{"text":"I personally usually like Red Robin and I have been here several times with my girlfriend. However this particular time my girlfriend ordered a salad with salmon and I ordered the same salad but with chicken. She asked for no tomatoes on her salad. When the salads came out my salad didn't have tomatoes and hers did. So our waitress took them back to get fixed. However when she brought them back is was extremely Evident that they just moved chicken from one salad and salmon to the other. We asked our server to please remake mine because my salad had salmon residue all over the lettuce. Our server was very apologetic and was amazing. The manager however came over to the table after waiting five minutes for a switch and took my salad back and told us that the cooks assured her they did not simply switch the meats from one salad to the next. As a manager lying to your customers is a big no no. My girlfriend and I both work at a restaurant and our manager would fire us if we served food that was \"remade\" in this fashion. I love Red Robin's but this particular location needs a new manager desperately!"}
{"text":"A group of co-workers and I showed up for an end of the year lunch (we work for CCSD) and we were at our table, sat and talked to at 12:55 pm. I kid you not, after an hour of waiting for our food (thank God for Facebook time stamps on posts) our server came to the table and told us that our order was only showing 22 minutes on the ticket, and all of their managers were working in the kitchen.  As a former server, I wanted to give him he benefit of the doubt, after all it was busy and he and everyone else was obviously in the weeds too.  Two people from our party of 8 had to leave, so they obviously didn't get their food.   About 10 minutes later our food started showing up slowly.  My order in-particular came last.  I'm not upset that it took terribly long, I'm disappointed in how the management handled our experience. The server has no control how fast the kitchen turns tickets.  With that being said we saw 2 different managers who tried to be accommodating, however instead of asking if there was anything else we needed, I feel as though they should have comped the ENTIRE bill, not just 2 burgers.   Poor management style in my opinion.  Now don't think that we didn't take care of our server.  He still made 20% off of our table (before food was taken off, etc.)

Bottom line, going to Red Robin? Be prepared to wait a LONG time and be disappointed in how management handles it."}
{"text":"I don't like Red Robin. I was never a fan of their bottomless bland big cut steak fries. They're plain gross and bland.Burgers, I'd rather go to Wendy's and get their dollar burger! One night after work me and hubby dint know where to go and I was craving for fish and chips so thought of going to Red Robin for this.

I was surprised to see they have bottomless sweet potato fries! For an additional of .79c you get endless of this side! Happy girl! I'm not sure when did they start having this cuz we don't really frequent this place but I'm glad they have it, I have the sole reason to go back to the place again.

But still only an A-OK rate though, the service was going great until I asked for another order of s.potato fries it took them forever to bring another one, we're already ready to go the time she brought the fries was the same time we gave our card to pay. Too bad but I still took some of the fries home and munch them the following morning, yeah I know they're kind of soggy but don't blame me I just love sweet potato fries ever."}
{"text":"I love the food, however, I've been avoiding this location because it's just so darn loud.  The last time I went was with my 4 year old son and I could not hear a thing he said, and it's not as if he's a particularly quiet kid.

It's just way too loud."}
{"text":"When we walked in at 7:30 on Monday night, we could see that every table that didn't have guests seated was dirty, I mean EVERY one. We were seated in the bar. The server forgot our appetizer, the extra $3.00 we paid for larger burger was a ripoff, it looked the same as the 6.99 burger. The burgers are good, but, they are severely understaffed, the service is slow and the place was dirty. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Good menu and good concept. But service is terrible. Walked in to not be greeted for 5 minutes and then when she finally asked she didn't apologize, never looked at us, ignored us completely, and didn't care about us. The restaurant is good but service just isn't there. Restaurant is completely empty and took us 10 minutes to be seated. Food is good but be ready for a wait and a long time waiting for food."}
{"text":"I really like their burgers here and live that I can make any of them a veggie burger!"}
{"text":"I took my family of 7 to the Red Robin in Willoughby, Ohio. They were running a promotion and \"Offer begins 7/20/17 and ends 7/30/17. Valid at participating locations. Dine in restaurant and receive 50% off a Fire-Grilled Gourmet Burger with purchase of an additional Gourmet, Finest or Big Tavern Burger; entrée; entrée salad or sandwich.\" I was told I could only get the gourmet burger. I disagreed and showed the email to my server. She said ok and went away. Moments later her manager, Dominic, comes to the table and aggressively tells me that my email is wrong. I try to show it to him, but he refused to look or be corrected.  He walked away while I was trying to explain to him. He turned around and came back stating he would not argue with me. I was confused, like how did this all happen. I became so upset with him that I asked for his managers name. I go to the restroom and come back to the table and there is a check on the table. I HAD NOT BEEN SERVED ANY FOOD!. We were so frustrated we decided to leave and when I asked his name he accused me of walking out on my bill. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Red Robin in many years. I'm not even sure why I went here except as usual the line for In n Out was long, and I craved a burger. I had to do some shopping at the mall, so I went in the entrance and the photos looked delicious, so in I went.

They have quite a few gourmet burger selections, and the prices were as high as I remembered from my first visit. But considering the prices of burgers, especially gourmet ones, they didn't feel outrageous as in the past.

I went with the Royal Red Robin burger, with egg and bacon. It was really very good. A milkshake for $3.99 added on, it was about $18 all in with tip. 

No complaints here, service was good, and you do your check out right at the table with the electronic pad. Interesting that the auto tip starts at 20%....you can adjust if you like. 

Nothing fancy, but it was a good burger so 3.5 stars overall. I would return to try other selections."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food is pretty decent. The onion rings are good and the burgers are decent, but it's always the service that is so disappointing! The hostess was rude and didn't care to sit us or answer our questions. Our waitress was nice but very forgetful and didn't return to check up on us. I'm done going to Red Robins! I can get a cheaper, same quality burger, with better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Where we live we don't have a Red Robin but we have the commercials, and my husband has been on the hunt for a RR for years! Well
When we got to Chandler we found there was one close by! He was a happy boy! Now did it live up to his excitement? Not really!  We had the choose 2 appetizers... the fried pickles were burned and the mozz sticks tasted like those from
The freezer section at the supermarket! He had the bacon cheese burger and he said it was good!  I had the chophouse and it was dry and had very little sauce! I've had a better mushroom melt from Wendy's!   The restaurant ambiance was good but it is so a chain restaurant! Nothing original! Relaxed atmosphere! We did have  a pretty good waiter."}
{"text":"My first time to Red Robin ...Very disappointed with the service and food.... We waited 20 mins and I decided to ask a server if we had a waitress ... She made some excuse and the manager came up and apologized... This must happen a lot cuz he didn't offer us anything ... They have bottomless fries but they are not even good...I didn't even finish what I had...We won't be be back!"}
{"text":"I've got to be in the mood for burgers, but when I am.. This place is \"alright\". 

The only reason why I came here for lunch was due to the fact that I work in Henderson along with me and my friend getting some shopping done at Galleria Mall. Otherwise, if that weren't the case I would not have opted for lunch here.

The burger selection is alright at best. I guess I can say I'm only a fan of theirs due to their bottom-less basket of fries with additional Red Robin seasoning - YUM! Their shakes are pretty deliciously as well, but this is a burger joint. You don't go to a steak house for their mashed potatoes, right? Same thing here: you don't go to a burger joint for their fries and shakes.

I can say that my waitress was a doll and was constantly checking up on us. I'm a big fan on excellent customer service, which is probably why she got a decent tip from both of us.

To sum it up, if I'm in the mood for some delicious fries and a good shake then I'll come here. If I'm in the mood for a good burger, I'll head elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try. First impression has already aggregated me. We asked for a booth and there were clearly open booths and was told that section was closed.  Within minutes after sitting they started sitting people in the same booths we were told were closed. If you are not willing to accommodate your customers, get into a different business."}
{"text":"We've never had a bad experience here. Both service and food were great! Our table was clean when we arrived and was bussed throughout out visit. Drinks stayed full even during a busy Saturday lunch rush. I'm sure we'll be back again as we've been here several times before."}
{"text":"I am writing to call out our server Sarah Co. She was fantastic. Our food order was correct and she came around to ask if we needed anything. Brought a drink refill with out asking. She was pleasant and engaging. We have been a a streak of just bad service lately at area restaurants...so  it was refreshing to have someone so nice, that also did her job."}
{"text":"No big problem...went there on a Sunday evening and they were out of onion rings?!?!  My daughter ordered macaroni and cheese and they were out of macaroni and cheese?!?!?!  While I was waiting for a table, I saw restaurant staff bringing in boxes of frozen french fries through the front door.  
Like I said no big deal but I don't know how you run a restaurant and run out of such restaurant staples."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Red Robin in the Waterfront yesterday afternoon after the Steeler game as it had been a couple of years since we ate at this location and were craving a burger.

Server was pleasant but not good - incorrect drinks, never brought requested condiments, waited extended amounts of time for drinks, etc.

Food was worse - we ordered our burgers \"Medium\" and both received burgers that oozed blood when cut in half. Asked for replacements and waited 25 minutes and once new food arrived found the burger patties to be burnt on the outside and cooked thru to cardboard consistency on the inside. French fires were also a mix of cooked ok and slightly undercooked with a few that were still cold inside and barely thawed.

Manager came to table and said he would take one meal off the check and said he was told we wanted \"Well Done\" burgers. We informed him that we wanted Medium burgers which shouldn't be bloody but did not want burnt, flavorless charred burgers and undercooked fries.

With Purgatory, Rock Bottom right across the street and Five Guys nearby, we can't think of any reason to come back to this location."}
{"text":"Food was very good and always very good, but service every time I go is not good.  Hard to order a beer in combination with a glass of water.  And Endless fries would be nice but I never got a refill so Endless Fries means nothing.  These restaurants don't understand business.  Water is almost free. Glasses don't cost that much."}
{"text":"I hate to give 3 stars honestly. This is also not because of the food. Food here is pretty good with many many options. I met my friend/broker here for a mid lunch before the closing of my home. It was slow because of it being after the lunch rush. We sat at the bar. Usually service at the bar is great but not this time. It was slow and long. We also didn't have everything we needed when our food came. I.E. Silverware and condiments. And my friend was missing an item off his plate. We managed to get out of there in time to be 5 minutes late for the closing. While the food is good, the service can improve."}
{"text":"Red Robin, Yum! It's one of my guilty pleasures. Love their tower of onion rings. Only had take outs here. Ordering is straight forward, pick up is fast at the bar. The staff is friendly and glad to put extra fries in the box for you when requested."}
{"text":"Decent spot for a burger. It is a corporate franchise and the service is a little lacking. I believe good have more management training. All and all a good spot for a decent burger. They do have endless sides most popular is the fries. I ended up getting the Royal Red Robin with Swiss cheese and a side of chili"}
{"text":"Haven't been here since I was the Red Robin in high school. Wow it has changed. I love the new look!  Love my freckled lemonade drink and the tropical Mai tai is great too"}
{"text":"Ughhhh, how could I forget about this place??? To me, this is simply just bar food with super, jacked up prices. I've had better chicken fingers from the hospital cafeteria.. 

They are known for their burgers, which go for about $10, that is just a big hunk of  meat with all the regulars, but also some that are \"different and unique.\" Keep in mind, I am a lover for the burgers. 

The last time I went we were told by our waitress that our Strawberry Lemonade (yes, I'll admit, this IS amazing) and our fries, were not as bottomless as we thought??? They advertise bottomless drinks and fries with their meals, but .... \"they aren't as bottomless as you think.\" Okay... I understand you cant have a party of 12 in there for 2 hours endlessly gorging on fries and drinks, but come on, there were 4 of us. And your measly helping of 8 fries per basket disappears fast, but.... oh well.

So, if you want some bar food, go to a bar. It will be cheaper and more generously portioned whether bottomless or not."}
{"text":"Got the GBD burger supposed to be a half pound burger look the size of McDonald's 1/4 pounder. The roasted peppers had so much olive oil on them you couldn't taste the burger which was supposed to be Angus beef. The first manager that came to the table said that is how they are made. The second manager apologized and did take the burger off the bull. The fries were good."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years (trying to keep it local yo) however I couldn't turn down the 2 for $15 tavern burger deal, which was very good, plus I had the opportunity to peruse the rest of the menu and you can color me impressed, there are some really great looking things on there!! Personally I love the unlimited root beer float because I just love them, I was even happier when it came in a giant mug instead of a regular sized one, made it double the fun!! I can't wait to have one of the boozy milkshakes."}
{"text":"Has just reached \"never again\" status. The place is dangerously filthy and the service is worse.
We waited 30 minutes just to pay our bill."}
{"text":"Waited 45+ minutes for our appetizer. Server never checked on us in that time. Definitely understaffed yet 6-7 servers were able to do 2 birthday song celebrations... Not impressed."}
{"text":"As we parked we said \"Woo HOO!  Unlimited fries!!!\"   Why do I mention that first?  Well, I suppose it's important to know that they have unlimited fries, but more important here is knowing the level of culinary excellence we were looking for in this eating experience.  We were out.  We were hungry.  We wanted some place we didn't eat all the time and presto - there it was.  It had been a few years since I'd last been to a Red Robin, and based on this experience - I might go a bit more often.

As we walk in - the hostess area has lots of room for seating and even has a small arcade with about 6 old school video games.  Very cool if you are waiting for a large party, have a long wait , or (let's be honest) if the kids finish eating before you do and you want them to go kill some time so you can eat in peace.  I'm sure your server would be happy to give you quarters.

Their menu is one giant page, stuff on both sides.  I was IMPRESSED with their variety.  Burgers (Beef, Fish, Chicken, Boca, Gardenburger etc) are their main entree here - though they also have \"dinners\".  They really stretch the burger concept.  Beyond what I mentioned above - which all come in many forms, they also had a Pot Roast Burger (Totally trying that one next time) and a Carnitas burger.  Not your momma's burgers.  I tried the Carnitas burger and my companion had the Whiskey BBQ Bacon burger.  We were tempted to start with their tower of Onion rings (did I mention this was not a diet day?) but decided it was WAY too big for the two of us.  The server mentioned they could do a half order and we caved in.  They were yummy.  Nothing out of this world, but very good.  Came w/ Ranch and a special sauce that the server mentioned was a BBQ + Ranch w/ a kick.  It was interesting.  

Her more traditional burger was definitely awesome.   First bite to last - though she only got through the first half of the burger while there and the rest went home.  My carnitas burger was... good.   It was good.  It was far from great, but it was juicy and warm and had some decent flavor.  It said it came w/ onions, but unfortunately these weren't cooked with the carnitas - or at all.  A slice of white onion wasn't bad, but grilled onions would have been much better.  

Neither of us liked our drinks - I got the tea and she the lemonade - so we decide to return those and drink water w/ dinner and splurge on splitting a shake as the folks at the table next to us were raving about how the shake was better than 5 & Diner.  Their shakes normally have a \"reserve\" container, but the server was nice enough to just split it for us into 2 glasses w/ our own whip cream and sprinkles.  We asked for them to do a chocolate banana shake (they offered the flavors individually) and it was amazing.  Real pieces of banana in the shake.  Super chocolaty.  It was my companions favorite part of the meal.  (Eating with eyes closed kind of good)

Best part?  The whole thing was $26 + tip.  We were stuffed and leaving w/ half of our sandwiches and some of those amazing all you can eat steak fries to have as our \"snack\" for later.

The atmosphere isn't as upscale as say... a Chilli's (wow, that sounds so sad!) but it is super family friendly.  It's clean.  The service was attentive, friendly and offered suggestions.  

And don't forget the all you can eat steak fries..."}
{"text":"We had visited Red Robin once before in Summerlin and had a relatively good time there with friends. This time we decided to try the red Robin near us after a shopping putting. We were famished when we arrived we were sat at a table in a timely fashion and we had a waitress take our order within the first 10 minutes. After waiting 30 minutes the waitress came back apologize for the slowness of the food, filled up our drinks and told us that it wouldn't be much longer for our burgers. Despite this we waited almost another 25 minutes before our burgers came out and we could finally start eating. My burger was not very hot when it arrives and the fries were soggy. My friend's burger was dry and the meat was over cooked. She told the waitress this when she came back to check on the us and the only compensation she would offer is to make her  another burger. This was after we had waited over an hour for our food and were so hungry by the time the food finally arrived. Quite disappointed with the service and the quality of food this time for the prices we paid. I am not sure would dine there again. 



Dined here again on May 8th Sunday 2016
Great lunch today much improved food from the last time around. The waitress was great and very friendly. I will be updating my review from the last visit to a great dining experience !! Thank you for asking us to try Red Robin again...much better experience !!"}
{"text":"There was a time I was about to completely give up on Red Robin. It was right after the time when they started asking \"Some pink or no pink?\". I tend to be one of those weird people that likes a medium burger (or med/rare if I know the place grinds their beef on site). And the burgers always tasted overcooked to me.

But the past few visits things have been better. The burgers taste good, they do not seem to be cooked quite as much, and the service is always friendly. There are better local places to get a burger. But this is place has definitely improved in the past couple of years!"}
{"text":"Went to Red Robin last night for dinner.  We ordered onion rings tower,  burgers & shakes.  It didn't take us long to realize that the grease that the onion rings were cooked in was rancid.   By that time we had eatten about half of them.  We got home & one of us was in the bathroom vomiting for 2 hours.  The next day 24 hrs later the other of us had diarrhea  & nausea. This will be our last visit to Red Robin!  Stay the hell away from this place!  You don't want to feel like I feel right now!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner tonight and I was beyond impressed. When we walked in, the place was PACKED, but as we were only a party of two, we were seated within five minutes. We were asked what we'd like to drink, and promptly received what we'd ordered. 
When it came time to order our food, we both got burgers: I got the mushroom swiss burger, and she got the gluten-free whiskey river burger. Once we put in our order, we waited for a good 30-40 minutes before the manager, John, came by our table. He explained that her burger was not made gluten-free, and for the inconvenience and the wait, dinner was on him. Our food arrived shortly after he came by our table, and still he comped the meal. Our waiter, Nick, was also fabulous, making sure everything was taken care of without hovering.
Although the food was a solid 7 out of 10, the service is what made the experience for me. The staff that I dealt with were super polite, very friendly, and made the night great. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic here, we get the Big Tavern and like the cheesecake for dessert. There is always a wait in the evenings, no matter what day of the week it is, but the food is worth it. I do think they are a bit understaffed as the servers, though friendly always seem to be incredibly stressed and out of breath. Even though we order our dessert on the tablets that are on each table, we still have to place the dessert order as soon as we receive our burgers, or else we will be waiting for at least 10 minutes after we are finished. -1 point for that and the 20 min wait to be seated. It would be nice if there were more locations as well as they are all on the very edge of town."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in for lunch and had a good meal. My previous Red Robin experience in Northridge, CA was not the best (see separate Yelp review). However, this was enjoyable.

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is we were not offered more fries. Not that we would have said yes because we could hardly finish our entrees after eating a tall onion ring appetizer. A picture of my plate is provided after I had already eaten a few fries. The meal was delicious. I normally go with a chicken sandwich but selected the cod and sweet potato fries.

The restroom was clean and the manager stopped by to check in. Two pluses.

We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent service at this location!  The Mac n Cheese burger was outstanding.  Fries could've been a larger portion.  Donut dessert with the dipping sauces was insanely good!   Casey, our server, topped off the great experience to make it even more fabulous!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Red Robin. I called in an order and a very sweet lady by the name of Freddie helped me. She was the most patient, funny individual. She definitely would be the reason I come back to this specific location!"}
{"text":"This place gets worse every time I go. Sticky tables and menus. Today I went and there was a wilted piece of lettuce in the back of the electronic device they have on the tables. Then when I passed out the appetizer plates there was a large piece of broccoli on the table that had been stuck to the bottom plate. It took over 40 minutes to get our food and when they did bring it, it was only for one person in our party. The food was tasteless!!!  And the burger was over cooked. I asked for medium and got well done. The patty was unseasoned.  A little salt goes a long way.  My sisters grand daughter got the Mac n cheese and it had no flavor at all. 
I don't think I'll ever be back. There are better burger places!!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and delicious! Alex is by far one of the best servers in the valley he didn't forget us and made sure we were comfortable which is so rare nowadays! If we could reserve a server like a table we would definitely reserge alex!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed with the service at this location.  In fact, the only reason I put two stars is because the food is decent.  We love Red Robin but this location is the closest to our house and unfortunately, every single time we come here the service is just terrible.  I would never write a negative review based on just one experience because I get it... everyone has a bad day, some servers are newer than others, etc.  So I always try to give it another chance but sadly, every server we've had here same story - slow, no refills, when we get refills they just leave empty cups on the table (I should have taken a picture this one time when our table literally had 10 empty cups with only three of us dining).  Anyway, maybe they need better training or something."}
{"text":"This Red Robin is okay. The food always tastes good, but even though I ask every time, I've never seen them come out with a burger that is pink in the center. I'm not sure why they even ask if it's always going to be well done (though not dry). 

Service has a 50/50 shot of being inattentive. But again, this is a chain restaurant and the burgers do taste good. So I'll just tip on the low end and forget about it."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible! We got there and there wasn't a wait and lots of empty tables. The hostess said it would be a 20 minute wait. I was super confused hence the empty tables and no one waiting but ok sure. We were starving and didn't want to go anywhere else. A minute later a server starts chatting up the hostess and some random dude. I look at the hostess and what a miracle she comes up to me and said \" A table just opened up.\" Yeah ok, this hostess was horrible. I've been a hostess myself and she has no clue what she's doing. The server saw us twice maybe three times and we were there for over an hour and a half. Just overall horrible service. This rating is a 2 because the food was good, but the service kills it."}
{"text":"My son and I just happened to be in the neighborhood after a business meeting and decided to stop for lunch. It's been a long time since we've been here.

The hostess was very nice and we're seated immediately. Started out with Chi Chili Cheese Fries, this was very good.  We ordered Cluck & Fries, and a Smoke & Pepper burger. They were both delicious and came with bottomless fries. If we had known, we would have pass on the appetizer.

The waitress was very attentive came to check on us at least every 5 minutes. The place is clean and nice atmosphere. Overall, we glad to have a chance to come in here again. Definitely would visit again when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here so I had to leave a few stars, but if I were to leave stars based on my overall experience I would leave 1 star. The reason I felt like this was because I sat in the bar area at a booth over the weekend and received bare minimum service. When I first sat down it took a while before the sever acknowledged us. Once she took our order it was just bare minimum service from there. She never asked if we would like refills on anything. We paid for our food and when the survey popped up on the screen I laughed in my head. Does she really want a survey of how I feel I was treated today? I never took the survey, but I feel like this establishment should know how my experience was so it doesn't happen again....hopefully. I love burgers! I just don't want to eat at places where I feel like the same employees can't wait until I leave."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in my last trip here. Previous visits have always been great, but this time was so bad that I don't think we'll go back. 

Menu changed and they took off my favorite burger. No problem, I can just try something else. The burger wasn't bad but here's my issue... 

We ordered a couple of their 'happy hour' drinks. Online they were listed at $3, our waitress told us they were actually $4.50 (which we were ok with), but when the check came they were $5.50. When we inquired with the waitress, she said, 'they must have raised the happy hour prices without telling us.' Honestly, you can't do that to customers. You need to honor the original price you tell them. This felt like a bait-and-switch.

Service was SO SLOW. It took for-ev-er to get the check and then get my credit card back.

Also, I know they're bottomless fries, but they give you a tiny amount to start, and if you ask for more it's at least a 10 minute wait. 

For two average burgers and two drinks, after tip it was $45. That's way too high for a chain. If you're going to charge $14.50 for a burger, it needs to have more than 6 fries on the side and a patty a little larger than the palm of my hand."}
{"text":"The restaurant GM has contacted me based on my review here on Yelp & me posting on Twitter about my experience. 

Although she was kind and has assured me that these unsanitary conditions will be rectified, I will still not be dining at this establishment. I do however appreciate her phone call."}
{"text":"This Red Robin is 100x better than its sister restaurant at the Galleria Mall. It's like walking into a completely different restaurant, it's just decorated the same. 

We visited on a Saturday night and got seated at the bar right away. I initially thought \"here we go...the bartender is also our server and he's going to forget about us\". Boy was I wrong. Our server came over right away and took our drink order. We weren't quite sure what we wanted for dinner yet so we started with the jalapeno coins and some french fries & ranch (their ranch is seriously like crack. I love it here. It's creaminess and consistency set it out from the rest). Our server accommodated us and got us our apps hot & fresh right away! P.S. their strawberry lemonade is heavenly, has fresh strawberries floating in it and has unlimited refills. YES!

I did notice that Red Robin had a newer menu. It's more condensed and organized, which I found helpful, as their last one was like a bible. So thick and took forever to get through. My fiancé chose the Royal Red Robin Burger which is like breakfast on a bun - meat, cheese, an over easy egg, bacon, mayo and garden. I chose the Crispy Chicken Burger - just chicken and cheese only. When our food came out we were excited to see our fries presently beautifully in a little medal cylinder. It made it look like a fancy dish....not just scattered amongst the plate. My fiancé's burger was cooked perfect and he enjoyed it (more like inhaled it! lol). My chicken sandwich came out with black bubbles of cheese and was burnt :( The bartender took control of the situation and got me a fresh one right away. It was juicy, tender and flavorful the second time around so I was a happy camper. My fiancé really enjoyed the spicy dipping sauce that came with the jalapeno coins. He kept dipping his burger in it and asking for more :D 

For dessert we ordered the Mud Pie. It was delicious, tasty and they put extra hot fudge in the dish for me. YAY! The cookie crumb crust was delightful!

I vowed never to eat at RR again after my terrible experience at the mall, however due to the Eastern location AND their great customer service....we will be return customers now. Just only to this one!"}
{"text":"Burgers seem to be getting smaller, less meat. That's probably how they keep some of the prices down. And of course the bottomless fries."}
{"text":"So, I have a friend who LOVES Red Robbin. And I kinda scoffed and thought, \"uh huh. Okay.\"
I was craving a JUICY, FATTY burger, and I've had my share around town and thought, \"Hey, why not give this place a shot.\"

My burger was SO DANG GOOD! Was it because I was phening for one? I don't know. Everything about it worked for me, and I got my medium with a bit of pink on the inside.
The salsa burger was really cute looking, and though it sounded so bizarre, it was actually PRETTY GOOD. 

Onion rings were way too gooey on the inside for me. And the breading was not my fave. 
I'll just order a simple burger next time. 

View my photos for the burger I got!!!!"}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with the food or the restaurant in general but I Recommend that You tAlk with oNe of your waiters. This person makes costumers feel uncomfortable by saying awkward jokes, lingering waaaaayyyy too long, and he even dropped a plate on me. I have stopped coming to this particular red robin as much due to him being there. I hope you will take my opinion into consideration. Please do something about the situation."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Service was never as bad as this time. I'm not sure if it's annoying to ask for a booth but we had two kids with us so that is what we requested. The hostess looked confused for about 6 minutes and then sat us at a table. The table was filthy and we then noticed that the people that came in behind us got seated at a booth. No one ever came to our table so my husband asked if we could be moved to a booth with a server. We finally got service about 25 minutes after arrival. The food was mediocre and the service was awful."}
{"text":"Omar was amazing today. We always love coming here. But Omar was great. The manager was good watching him work in the kitchen to helping other staff. I also noticed other staff asking others if they needed help. I asked Omar as I was leaving for a to go cup. And he was kind in getting it even though he was busy. As I was waiting for the drink near the bar. I had I think 3 members of the staff ask if I needed anything. Just well ran here. We own our family business Rusk Lock & Key and we know how it is to run a business and a lot of times things are not ran well in the community. And I can say they have a good team here and management."}
{"text":"I love it here we have become regulars but...
The service can be terrible. The girls at the front at doing this place in! You can hear a woman screaming in the back\"guys fucus, focus guys!\". That is unreal. Saturday is not recommended!"}
{"text":"Very bad experience! The server we had didn't seem to even want to be there. We waited 15 min to get our drinks and another 25 min to get our food. It was pretty irritating that multiple before that were sat after us got their food before us. We didn't order anything complicated and the were only 3 of us. I noticed the server tending more to the other tables than ours. I asked to speak with a manager and that was even worse!!! It's sad people work hard for their money and choose to come to Red Robin and spend their money there. but what do we get for choosing them, bad service!!! There was a group of managers their chit chatting away and no one did anything about the bad service or wait time. I won't be taking my family to this location again."}
{"text":"My overall experience today was pleasant. Our hostess Anna was very polite, friendly, and accommodating. We were seated quickly and our orders were taken promptly. While the food was fast to come out and delicious, our waiter was constantly missing. It did not seem very busy but, our waiter wasn't very attentive and my friend ended up asking another worker to bring her another item. We were also only given one knife per two people. I patiently waited to consume my burger until I was brought another knife and by then my friend had already eaten half of her side salad. In total, we waited about 30 min through out lunch for our waiter to tend to our needs, some of which were fulfilled by other people. I will go to this location again because the food was delicious but, I just hope I don't have to wait that long again. P.S. Their fries are amazing"}
{"text":"Hostess Heather was AWESOME! Definitely the right position for her, discretion and great sense oif humor.  Server -Brit was on top of her game, busy at lunchtime but didn't forget anything & was so sweet to boot. Delicious French dip, took half home & it was still tasty. Thanks for a great meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my service tonight. We waited about 10 minutes for a server to come over and get drink orders even though they were slow.. the table next to us was dirty for well over 20 minutes before the hostess started to clean it off even though I could see 3 people standing around, including the manager sitting at a booth. I ordered a veggie burger wrapped in lettuce  and when I got it the burger was super burnt and it was wrapped in way too much lettuce. I tried to eat it, but it was way too burnt. I told the server, and she said she would get it remade and let the manager know. I watched her tell the manager who continued to sit at the booth and didn't come over to apologize and after I got the remake neither one of them came to check up on the remake. I work in a restaurant myself and know how important it is to check up on food that has been messed up, I was just overall very disappointed.."}
{"text":"Went there last night to celebrate my son's track meet. Got there about 9 pm so after the dinner rush. We were seated right away... at the absolute filthiest table I have ever sat at. The entire floor in that section of the restaurant was covered in garbage. There were 4 tables that sat with dirty dishes for at least 30 minutes. 

Our waitress that we started with told us that she was being sent home. But she stayed and served the table next to us for the remainder of the night. Our waitress was good, and the food was good, which is the only reason they got 2 stars. The bathrooms were also filthy and the trash probably had not been emptied in hours. 

The guy I saw bussing tables did half a table and then left to do God knows what. My husband (who loves Red Robin food as much as I do) said we likely won't be going back. This place belongs in the worst part of the East side."}
{"text":"Brianna rocks. Great food. Bottomless everything. The pricky pear lemonade is awesome."}
{"text":"Very good! The decor is nice with plenty of space and tables so getting seated was easy. The floor was very slippery though. Our server was very good and was on top of her game. My family ordered the onion ring tower and pretzel bites to share. They were awesome. The orange dipping sauce that comes with the onion rings is amazing. For my entree, I just got a burger with just the cheese and a side of fries. The burger was delicious as usual and the steak fries were crispy and flavorful, especially if you add their special seasoning! Overall, there were so many different options from appetizers to burgers to drinks. All around a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I'm still bitter over Red Robin for taking Salmon off the menu, their Salmon Caesar Salad was soooo good and was such a nice, healthy option. Fish is the only meat that I eat and there are now no healthy options when I don't want a burger, like most restaurants all of their salads have meat on them and the only fish they offer is fried.

That being said, Red Robin's birthday burger is one of the best birthday deals that I have found. I do love that I can replace any burger with a Gardenburger.
Service has always been good and their happy hour specials are good prices. Great for carry out!"}
{"text":"This place isn't the way it use to be. The server tonight (tommy) seemed really off. He had an attitude like if he hated his job, and you can see it in his look.. unfortunately for him, his tables were scattered all over the place, which I'm sure is not very pleasant. But, that's still no excuse to show how much you hate your job. We constantly had to ask for stuff, and it took a long time, each time.. we didn't feel very welcomed by him, we just felt like he wanted us in and out.. I use to love this place, but I don't think I'll be back.."}
{"text":"We came in today with the family for our daughters birthday and our server Emilie was the best she made sure our lunch was taken care of. It's this kind of service that makes places look these worth coming to.

She always checked to make sure our drinks were full and we had our bottomless fries. And they sang happy birthday to our da"}
{"text":"The wait staff has always been friendly and efficient every time I visit. The burgers are always delicious. My kid always gets a mini pepperoni pizza and he always eats the whole thing. On occasion, my endless fries come out luke warm or even cold, so I have to request freshly cooked fries and wait for those. That knocks it down by one star because hot food should never come out cold. Other than that, though, can't complain. They even give me a free meal on my birthday, which I love."}
{"text":"I'm not going to complain about the quality of the meat. I'm not going to complain about the calories involved. I'm not going to do any of those things because I'm not an idiot. I know what I'm getting when I go to a chain restaurant like Red Robin that offers endless french fries.

Needless to say, the girlfriend and I came in around 3 pm for an unhealthy, self-indulgent diner snacking. We started things off with their chips, salsa, and guacamole. It was better than one would expect, largely due to their \"jalapeno chips\" which are crunchy and delicious. Much better than the standard tortilla chip and I expect much more unhealthy as well.

My girlfriend isn't a vegetarian but she ordered a veggie burger anyway and I got a Royal Burger, which is essentially a plain old cheeseburger but with a fried egg on it. Both of us loved our burgers. I tried hers and it was delicious. She tried mine and thought the same. We both had a beer (I had Dos Equis, she had Corona Light) to wash it down and in the end, we couldn't complain about anything.

We had a fun time, it was delicious, and I got what I paid for. Absolutely no *reasonable* complaints that I can think of. I like to curve each review to cater to the expected quality of the restaurant, so understand a 5 on Red Robin doesn't compare to a 4 at Cheesecake Factory, but this particular Red Robin did a really good job. I'll be back again soon, even if it does look a little \"ghetto\" on the outside."}
{"text":"My family again had a wonderful time at Red Robin!!! Nicole you are awesome to my family!!! My daughter had a wonderful birthday. Thank you Nicole!!! We love you!!! The Wells Family."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The service is fine if you don't bother them too much.

I, for one, can eat a lot and take advantage of the bottomless fries, drinks, salad, etc. but I've found after asking one or two times the servers become quite curt and avoid you, or take forever to get your request to you. Either they need to limit the customer's expectations if they aren't going to follow through or they need to get more staff to meet the flow of orders/re-orders. 

One time the waitress in the bar section stinted our table for so long the manager had to stare her down and talk to her about continuing to serve us."}
{"text":"In all honesty I have tried Red Robbins once before but this was my first time ever setting foot inside the establishment. I must say I had a pleasant experience, our waiter was super friendly and the food was (in my opinion) amazing. I had the bee's knezz or something along those lines lol. (Can't remember how they had it spelled). Either way it was waffles and chicken that was absolutely wonderful to the taste buds. Had a cookie magic milkshake. (YUM). I will definitely be back. Yesterday was just too good of an experience not to. (:"}
{"text":"My second, and last, visit. I ordered an Old Fashion but was told there were no bitters....

My cheeseburger was small and overwhelmed by toppings.  I ordered medium rare but received well done.

I can't image why this joint is so popular.

{"text":"We have always been happy with the food and service. They do tend to get busy for lunch and dinner, but don't deserve 3 stars...."}
{"text":"Pretty much the only location I will come to now. Always very polite staff. Sometimes they make mistakes on the food but it is quickly corrected with an apology. Rewards program is pretty good. Just sign up then give them your phone number each time you come in. Every ten items you buy is a free burger I think. As well as free on your birthday I believe. They cook the burgers right for the most part which is more than I can say for another burger place in town (see my other reviews) great lunch spot"}
{"text":"What a terrible lunch today. Usually go to galleria mall location but wait was to long so went to this location. Big mistake. Decided to sit in booth in the bar. There were five tables total occupied with 3 to 4 employees in the area. Took close to 15 minutes to be greeted and asked what we wanted to drink. Completely disorganized with none of them knowing what to do. Finally ordered burger came out charcoal burnt. Sent back second one was ok but not great. Will stick to galleria location . Second star for the server in training. He was nice but was In over his head with no help"}
{"text":"Good burgers cold beer. Kinda hard to go wrong with this combo.... prices are high and the traffic at the e waterfront sucks but you could do much worse. The service was good too."}
{"text":"I've had nothin but good experiences here. Anytime there's Ben a problem with the food it was fixed without question!"}
{"text":"We will not return back to Red Robin. We went after Christmas and once we were seated it took forever for someone to come and greet us. Once they did we order drinks and food at the same time. I ordered and ice tea without lemon and when arrived it has lemon and she left so fast I couldn't even ask for sweet and low I had to go find some on another table. When our food arrived my son who requested no tomatoes had tomatoes on his burger. Again she took off so quick you couldn't request anything like mustard. The manager came over and I vented to him but he really didn't seem to be bothered by it. In fact, I heard him tell our waitress what a great first day she is having. That explained it all. So then our waitress comes back so we can pay and tells me to use the kiosk if I'm using my card and shortly realizes we don't have one on our table. She then takes my card to pay the bill and we asked for a to go box. Well here she comes with my receipt and again no to go box. We sat there for a little bit waiting but never saw her again. I once again had to get up and go find someone to get us a box so we could get out of there. For the money you would expect better service and we do so we will not be going back to Red Robin there are too many other options out there with better service than this."}
{"text":"Good burgers and chicken sandwiches, wth lots of varieties to choose from. Great steak fries! I love their ranch dressing, too. Fun place to take the kids. My children adore their macaroni & cheese."}
{"text":"Against our better judgment, my husband and I strayed away from the hamburgers and went for fish fillets and a spicy salad. We will never do that again. There is a reason Red Robin is known for yummy burgers and fries. Service was average for delivery of the food but slow for drinks and refills. We liked how we paid for the bill at the table. We will be back but only for hamburgers!"}
{"text":"They get five stars now. You know why? Three little words I long to hear: Gluten-Free Buns! (OK, technically that's two words, but I love them nonetheless!)

The buns are a dollar extra, but if you are like me and are tired of eating a burger with a lettuce wrap, or worse, with cutlery, just for the illusion of a sense of normalcy, they are worth it. And, frankly, quite tasty.

I don't know if all RR are serving them now, or from the same bakeries/distributors, but I for one am glad for it!"}
{"text":"Went to Red Robin on free teacher burger night!  It was packed.  The hostess did very well greeting guests even with it being so busy and people returning to ask how long it would be.  She kept a smile on her face.  Our waitress, Veronica, was awesome.  The food was tasty.  The onion rings were cold and I could have asked her to fix that, but we were having fun talking to fellow teachers and former students that it would not have mattered anyway.  Veronica kept checking on us and made sure we had what we needed!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of the Freckled Lemonade (extra extra strawberries) and the Ensenada Chicken Platter.  I order the same thing every time I go and that will probably never change.  When I love something I won't risk ordering something I might not like, LOL.  I always order the cheese fries and onion rings for app's.  I am forever a Red Robin fan!!  It was slow in the restaurant and our service was great."}
{"text":"Getting tired of these chains that show you this great burger in a menu . Then bring you something that does not resemble the picture at all. The bottomless fries are very good the onion tower is very good. The service not so good and cleaning up tables not so good. No such thing as happy hour there. But do have smaller portions of their appetizers."}
{"text":"Well, the only way I will go back to this store is if they do something nice for me and give me a comp. I ordered a burger called \"Southern Charm\". My rare burger was well-done. I do not eat dried out, overpriced burgers. I love a good burger, but this ain't it. So, I sent it back for something that was edible. After and long wait and everyone was finished eating, my burger came. Cooked medium and dry, but not as heinous as the first one. In the booth next to us, I overheard them getting a comp and $30 credit for their next visit. We didn't get much attention from the waitress or management. I made this my Red Robin location because it is closest to my home. From the looks of their rating here, I am not alone. I spent $56 on three crappy burgers and the fries that come with them. Palace Station has an excellent 1/2 pound burger for $3.99, which also comes with fries. So, you pay three times as much for a burger that is not even half as good. Fool me once, fool you. Fool me twice, fool me. The ice tea is weak, also. As a restaurant manager, it is plain to me that the cook cannot follow simple directions, which also then falls upon the manager's head because it is his job to protect his store."}
{"text":"Second visit in a row with a veggie burger that was so tough that you can't get your teeth through it.  They're letting these things frostbite or over-microwaving them by a wide margine.  How hard can this be?  They are probably the easiest microwave product I can think of.  To make it worse, there was a delay in getting the replacement out, and although we appreciated the manager's apology... normally this sort of thing is comped, right?

I passed on the $8 onion rings and $3 soda this time.  Might as well pay $6 for a beer."}
{"text":"Its a burger and fries kind of place.  I like the food and it is located in the mall which gives you another option other then the food court. But that's just it.  Its ok."}
{"text":"First time ordering curbside pick up! Ordered ahead online for pick up at 8:45. Arrived at 8:45 and waited until 9 to get my food! I had to call twice. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Brought the wife and kids here on a Sunday night.  We were seated within 5 minutes or so.   Although the lobby was empty, it turned out nearly all of the tables in the dining room were full.

As another reviewer said, this place feels loud and chaotic, even on a Sunday night.  It was difficult for the waiter to hear my wife and kids' orders; it seriously felt like a school cafeteria (noise-wise). Not relaxing at all; I cant imagine what it sounds like on a Friday or Saturday night. The acoustics just aren't good in here; maybe carpet and/or a different booth layout would help.

Food was good and reasonably priced.  Came out pretty quickly. Server did a pretty good job, but seemed a little stressed out like he had too many tables.

I might come back, but I really don't look forward to all the noise."}
{"text":"Bomb server Tina is amazing she def knows the menu well and took good care of us her service was splendid I appreciate great servers like her and that she was helpful"}
{"text":"Overpriced, bad service and basically not very good food.  Food ranged from average to almost inedible.  I 100% agree with Chad E"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night just a bit after 9pm. The restaurant is pretty much dead. Took almost 20 minutes to get a drink and now still waiting for food 45 minutes in. Used to come here for the kids, but I don't think we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"love the burgers here and the strawberry lemonade very good food shocked it had low ratings but this is yelp what you expect they dont care about business they just care about reviews but i like the burgers there good and the drinks good deals as well"}
{"text":"I'm not normally a chain-restaurant person, I'm a sucker for a good turkey burger and Red Robin has it down to a science. It's juicy and has that perfect grilled taste and I can get it on any burger topping combo they offer. 

The service at this Red Robin is always great - the staff is always friendly, and several know us by name and our order even though we only come in about once or twice a month.

Have a picky eater in your party? Don't hesitate to ask for things the way you want them - don't like pickles? Want your fries extra well done? Need some dipping sauce? No problem!  We've never gotten grief for asking and things have always come out correct. Perfect when taking the nephews out for a treat.

Bonus for kids and kid-at-heart adults - with the redesign they did this fall, there're new decor to look at (I personally love the Pac Man inspired stuff and the pirate pose chart), little table top ordering machines that double as game consoles for a fee and there are portable chalk boards for game playing. And kids can get crayons and coloring sheets as well as a free balloon.

I admit, when I first saw the little table top machines, I thought it would take away the personal touch with the server, but you are not required to use them and when you do it's not as odd/awkward as I thought it'd be. You can let them know you need drink refills (saving server a trip to table to ask) and pay for your check/see your bill at any time."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to RR in years but decided to go with a friend and overall it was a good experience. I love spicy food so I went with the Burnin Love burger with a veggie patty, hold the salsa and sauce. It was gorgeous to look at and pretty tasty but not mind blowing. I only ate half of it. Fries were good. I also had the nana nana moo moo shake...delish. My friend went with the wings...YUMMY! I ended up wishing I'd gotten that instead. The service was great and I'll definitely be back for those wings!"}
{"text":"First time at this location. Staff was pleasant and smiled with every interaction. Ordered a Guinness and the Burnin Love with Sweet Potato Fries. Burgers plate presentation was not the best and first order if fries was slightly over done. The second order of the bottomless fries, that right - you get endless fries, they were done perfect. Burger had great flavor. Guinness was not on tap at this location."}
{"text":"Update on weekend of, 07.18.15. Service is still horribly slow, fries have consistency of potatoes and it took me asking the server three times for a to-go box. Finally done with this location.  Won't even bother to comment on the value of the salad with whiskey river bbq chicken I mistakenly tried. Since this location is so strategically placed within a high tourist zone, reviews are probably worthless since they value the high turn-around. Avoid if you can."}
{"text":"I'm giving on star to the waitress and one star to the manager. They were really the only good things that we encountered at this location.

The parking sucks at this location. If by itself it would still be too small and since its in a crowded little shopping plaza it flat out sucks trying to find the entrance and then a spot. 

It was packed but we were sat quickly. Looking around I should have known we were in for a helluva night since everywhere I looked there were snot nosed little monsters getting high on soda and shakes.

One Little blonde girl started crying as we were sat and I felt sorry for the girl. That sorrow quickly turned to annoyance as the parental unit ignored the crying and it turned to ear shattering screams of pay attention to me! 

The waitress saw us flinching and apologized for the noise and the long wait for our food saying it was busy tonight (37 minutes for our food and the musical accompaniment of that little blonde girl and her monster back up screamers).

Food was normal Red Robin,  the manager came over and apologized for the screaming kids and took our drinks off our bill saying he wished parents had the sense to take their kids outside when they acted like that. The waitress was on top of drinks and small talk so it wasn't completely a negative experience.
 
If we go back it may be in the day time to avoid the kids/scream monsters"}
{"text":"After a long day of spending Sunday at the park with friends and family we decided to hit up Red Robin arounf 3pm because we figured it had so many options for all the different taste buds we had in our group... We were seated within 15 min and after looking around, I kinda wondered why it took so long since the restaurant was not that busy. The waitress was super friendly and was quick to get us drinks and our 4 appetizers ordered... The good experience ended there. The waitress was still friendly but seemed to take forever getting our order, and she got our order she was gone... we were all hungry and kinda wondering what was taking so long for the food. It got to the point where I was gonna ask what the hell was going on, he had waited about a hour for our food. They finally brought out our food and there was a total of 9 people with us... 1 person got cold soup (sent back), another got cold chicken in her salad (kept the salad and after waitress asked if chicken should be hot brought out new chicken), I got the smoke and pepper burger and my bun was completely soaked thru, and fries were soggy as hell. I asked for a new bun but figured I should see if the patty was even hot... Nope, the burger itself was cold... I sent my burger back and everyone ate in the meantime while my food was being remade, and I was eating after everyone was done. The waitress was still friendly and apologetic, and the manager was helping her and didn't even stop to apologize or explain. We got our check and there was nothing taken off. Im not big into complaining too much about our check so I just paid it... This will be the first and last visit to this Red Robin...."}
{"text":"Honestly except for the service, I was really let down by my latest Red Robin experience. While the staples were all still there such as the bottomless fries and strawberry lemonade, the Clucks (chicken strips) were sub par at best. Not sure if they were left under the heat lamp to long or what but they were barely warm at best. Also, being that I ordered them buffalo style, I am used to them drowning them in hot sauce but this time it looks like they barely dipped them on one side only. Lydia N's sandwich while good in theory came out soggy and with a funky tasting sauce that just didn't seem to compliment such as simple item. See her review for what she ordered. 

On the plus side though, they have a new drink menu with all sorts of infusions I would never dare try or even think to mix but somehow they managed to pull them all off quite well. Plus our server was awesome which is what saved this place from the dreaded one star Yelp review."}
{"text":"I used to come here pretty frequently but this location has gone to the dogs! The only part right was the initial greeting after that our server took forever to take our order, then proceeded to get everything in our order wrong, followed by soggy cold food and a speed waitress that barely stopped by and the place was empty... I've definitely been turned off from this place. I will not be returning to this location and I doubt I will return to any red robin anytime soon."}
{"text":"Are server Jesse was on point super nice very personable would come back just for him food was great to had a burger with fries and the chips and dip 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"Fantastic visit. We go a few times a year and always decent but this last visit seemed to take it up a notch. Our waitress was Tina and did a great job, manager Sunny came around and grabbed me an additional ranch dressing but the food was awesome. Fresh hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"We haven't eaten here in years. I can't remember why we stopped, because we used to visit quite frequently. I think it made me sick a few times, but that is by no means abnormal for me when it comes to restaurant food, so I won't blame it on Red Robin. We received a gift card so we gave it a go yesterday. My husband chose the bacon cheeseburger and steak fries. I ventured to the new four cheese melt and added turkey to it. I also got steak fries. When the food came out we were shocked at how little food came out! My husband got maybe 10 fries, yes, I know they are bottomless, but bring out enough to fill the plate please! Although tasty, I was left wanting more food after eating my four cheese melt and fries. I got a Nana Nana Moo Moo shake to go and my husband got a vanilla shake-both delicious! I just hate being hungry a few hours after eating out. It's my special meal of the week and I like a lot of food!"}
{"text":"I have been to red robin several times and I always feel like it is overpriced.  Needless to say I still feel that way but I do like their food.  I enjoy their salads personally, today I tried the Avacabbo (I think that's how it's spelled) and was really delicious.  I did have to send it back because they brought the wrong salad out initially.  They also \"lost our ticket\" so my daughter didn't get her food until almost everyone else was done eating ( I was also waiting for my returned salad and silverware as well).  Everything just took forever to get to us.  

Needless to say my daughter's noodles and marinara sauce cost more than a kids cheeseburger.  

The manager Jeff did come by after we paid and we told him what happened and he did give us a free appetizer with purchase coupon.  I felt like my daughter's meal should have been comp'd but I am glad that they were aware of what happened."}
{"text":"I wanna say this is was worst Red Robin experience I've ever had yeah I came around 10 o'clock before closing and it took them forever to get food out and on top of that I asked for napkins because they never gave us any I never got it till I used the bathroom. I'm very disappointed on the customer service as they only care about leaving early because they were mainly focusing on closing I get you want to leave early but check up on your customers more than just taking our orders and giving it to us then ditch us. Worst experience ever"}
{"text":"Burgers are good.. Service is ok. During weekdays service is very slow.. 

Try the 'DGB', 'Black&Bleu' or the 'A1 Peppercorn'. Bottomless fries are always a plus!"}
{"text":"Red Robin....yummmmm

Went there for lunch today.  I am in love with their diet peach iced tea!  So refreshing on such a hot day. 

I am a huge fan of their onion ring tower, but by the time my hubby and I split one of those, we never have room for the burger and fries. I asked our server if it was possible to sub the small order of rings for the fries with our burgers. BTW, you can do that for a $1.49 charge. Totally worth it. 

I ordered the whiskey river BBQ burger, medium, with the onion rings. Burger was cooked perfectly. Onion rings maybe could have been pulled about 15 seconds earlier. Not too big of a deal, just a smidge darker than usual, but certainly not burnt. 

Our server, Tony, was awesome. Checked on us regularly, brought extra napkins without us having to ask, and got us some of that wonderful tea to go.  He was also very friendly and had a great attitude. 

Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely wonderful experience at this Red Robin this weekend. 

Our waitress (who we later found out was the manager filling in for a waitress who called out sick) was fantastic! She was so friendly and personable. Gave us menu suggestions, and commented on the items we were ordering and how she liked them. She was a fantastic waitress. 

Our service was verrrry attentive. We had appetizers come out within practically minutes, food came out not long after that. Our drinks were always full and waiters/waitresses were always stopping by to check on us. 

Service was fantastic and our food was delicious. Left with full bellies and big smiles!"}
{"text":"Some things on the menu are good. Other things not so much. Definitely overpriced, but nice for kids."}
{"text":"I have never written an on line review but what I experienced today I just felt like I had to.  We arrived as a party of 5 and were told it would be 15 min.  I found that odd since there were many tables open in both the dinning room and bar area that would fit our party.  After 25 min I asked why we were still not seated.  I was told the servers that had open tables were to busy.  I asked about a large booth in the bar I was told they don't seat children in that area.  I asked why then did a family just depart the bar after eating and why did they just seat another family in the back area.  I was lied to by the hostess and she said they had a to go order.  I asked to speak to the manager while waiting for the manager the hostess found it necessary to mock me.  When the manager came out he said it is policy not to sit family's in that area.  I then asked why one family just left after eating there and another was sitting in the back corner.  He said he was unaware.  I repeated that I wanted the booth for my family he repeated the policy that they clearly don't enforced  but  apparently do when they feel like it.   We decided not to spend our money there.  He said I am sorry I said not apologize be consistent with your policy.  He said I am trying to help you I ask how all he did was tell me why I cant eat there.  We left and had a great meal with great service across the street.  DONT EAT AT THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch with my coworkers. I'd been eating burgers all week so I didn't really want another one. Also, the last time I came, which was my 1st, I didn't really enjoy the burger. So I opted for Red's Nantucket Seafood Scatter with no Clam strips. It was decent. Very thick breading on the shrimp which wasn't that great to me. It was kind of bland. The cod was pretty good though and the fries were just ok. Service was awesome. Very responsive and fast. But I doubt I'd visit Red Robin again unless I was with a group who wanted it."}
{"text":"Used to be a Red Robin by our work in California and we loved it.  This is our first experience with one here in Nevada and I don't think we will make a return any time soon.  Our server, Tina was fine and helpful.  After ordering it seemed a long time before our food came but they were busy which is why we were surprised that our food was barely warm.  The steak fries were soggy and limp.  My hamburger was not hot nor were the fries.  My husbands order was the same way.  Tina offered a replacement on the fries which we accepted but by the time they arrived we had eaten all our food, with the exception of the fries.  Tina sent the manager over but by that time we were through and she asked if we were in a \"better place\" now.  We told her we were fine just so we could pay and leave.  We won't put this Red Robin on our return list."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and brother because we hadn't been there in a long while. it took 20 min to get our water order in when the restaurant wasn't even packed. I ordered the bleu ribbon burger and took two bites and found a hair cooked into the burger. it was gross and I lost my appetite as did my brother and mom. we walked out and I will never come back. the manager did a good job at apologizing and offering us free dessert and a gift card for next time, but I insisted I didn't need it because we won't ever come back."}
{"text":"With all the Red Robins all over the country, I think I stopped at only one once on the road in California. But we figured we'd give the one in Downtown Summerlin a try.

It was cold and windy outside, but inside was so much worse. Icy air blasted from the AC, and there was nothing that could be done. One manager came over to apologize, said their AC is controlled by corporate, which is in Colorado. I guess they're too stoned out up there to care. Later, that manager returned with another one, only to sympathize with us sitting in our winter jackets trying to eat dinner. Maybe offer a hot toddy?

Our waiter, Drew, was excellent. He brought me a taste of the house chardonnay, because I don't usually drink that and they don't stock Riesling. It was passable and cheap. Our food was hit or miss. Mine was a hit - I had the chicken bruschetta sandwich, served on a torta roll. I liked that I was able to get salad instead of the fries, without an upcharge. Hubby ordered the turkey burger, and wasn't happy when the bun completely fell apart, making it hard to eat. His fries were soggy, but Drew replaced them with hot, crispy ones.

I can't enjoy any meal when I'm shivering from unnecessary cold. Too many joints in Vegas blast the AC during the winter, but this was exceptionally bad, and that's the outstanding takeaway from this experience."}
{"text":"Have to take away a star or two because we asked for outdoor seating and waited over 15 minutes to have bus boys clear a table (all patio tables were empty but dirty)  The saving grace was a very pleasant server. Food is typical Red Robin. Nothing to brag about and overpriced. Milkshakes look yummy but $5.00 is a bit much. I'm sticking with In-n-out burger when I want a bang for my buck."}
{"text":"I never seem to have a bad burger, I guess it's good to order burgers at a burger joint. The server seemed widely attentive and friendly and eager to help. The little kiosk computer thing on the table is still a bit odd to me but I'll live with it. I appreciate variety in a cheeseburger and most certainly recommend the blue ribbon burger and my personal preference on a lettuce wrap, just to save calories. But how could anything be wrong with bottomless steak fries?"}
{"text":"Do you like my half filled shake? Isn't that nice? For $5! And no i did not take a drink. Here's a tip....dont go here. Well, don't order it to go anyways because you will get ripped off big time."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm not going to comment too much on the food, it's a national chain and the burgers are decent.

My friends and I got together for a quick dinner. The menu had changed since I had last been there, but the same items I remember were on there, just in a different menu format. They also had new dipping sauces, which I was not impressed with.

The service during my meal here this time was not good. It took 3 times asking to get water. And whenever we asked for anything, it took a whole lot longer than it should have to make it to the table. 

But although the service was bad, Red Robin is still a good place for a quick burger with friends."}
{"text":"This was the first time in awhile to go to Red Robin.  My burger was great. I had the new dbl smaller burger. Nice size was juicy with all the trimmings. We did have a bad experience with the waiter. He was a smart mouth and was a little harsh with my brother in law and my husband. Then the manager came over to explain about the mix up all was fine until trying  to pay on the machine.my sister tried to split the check up because she had a coupon. She turned the light on for help.  Nobody came so we asked for manager. He got crappy with us and accused my husband of cussing. Which he did not! The waiter snapped because we asked for sauce and he took so long we asked someone else for another one anyways. He said hey bud couldnt you wAit for sauce and not ask someone else??? Shocking! And we really just wanted one more sauce and didnt want him to have to go back again. I never got refills on waters. And my brother practically begged for more tea. I don't plan on going back there anytime soon.  And the smart mouth guys can kiss my grits!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service is always awesome. Love the Banzai burger too. My family has been going to RR for years and its always a great experience."}
{"text":"The worst experience I've ever received anywhere in my life front desk girl doesn't pay attention to what's going on around her will never hear again"}
{"text":"Family dinner enjoyed for the most part.  The spinach dip was yummy, and we ordered it on the mini screens that are at every table.  Cool gadet!  I ordered the cape cod sandwich,  which was okay definitely better then ordering it at a fast food spot. The only thing that i was displeased with was my son's food. I ordered him a pizza with fries. When the server brought out the pizza the crust was burnt and the fries were placed on top, which is a no no for picky eaters. So i wasnt surprised he didnt eat it."}
{"text":"I haven't gone to Red Robin in quite some time, but can say we had a nice evening for dinner last Friday. The wait was not long at all, which was nice. We ordered a few drinks and an appetizer to begin. The appetizer was the pretzels with cheese and these were just okay. The pretzels tasted good but the cheese sauce wasn't anything that would make us want to get them again. I ordered the bleu burger and I really enjoyed it. I liked the sauce and thought it was a great combination of ingredients, while also not feeling too extremely stuffed after eating it. My boyfriend loves the endless fries of course and the options for dipping sauces. I think the fries tasted great as well."}
{"text":"Goodness I hate leaving this review as I come to Red Robin often and have for years but man this was a terrible experience. I will say it was busy, there were a lot of people and a lot of complaints going around also. We waited like 25 mins just to get our food. My son ordered the Red Tavern and some garlic olive oil fries he tells me mom try these I reach into his soggy cold fries then touch his burger and everything is like ice cold. We tell our waitress she takes it away and brings him a new one. Now when I ordered my bbq burger I did ask for some pink on the burger, my husband ordererd his burger the same way, he takes a bite of his and it's perfect... Cooked with a bit of pink... I bite into mine and it's like biting it strait from the package it was so pink that it wasn't even warm. We did get our food 
re-done and they did take it off our bill which in all honesty I appreciated the effort of trying to make it right. My waitress was great... Just a very bad kitchen day based on our experience and those complaining around us."}
{"text":"The food was great, we sat on the patio since it was a beautiful day out. Our server, Tracy, was not very attentive to our table. Unsure if she was having a bad day or if it was very busy inside but we had to ask multiple times for refills and place some tray items on the ground due to our table being so full and nowhere to place new items as they came in."}
{"text":"If you like non gourmet burgers not cooked to order, and bottomless cold French fries, then come on down!  Oh, stay clear of the guacamole, which looks and tastes more like the gunk in the filter of a pool than guacamole. To their credit, they did take half off of our bill after complaining. The waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"First time eat at red robin. So many burgers choices, I went with the black n bleu really good. And the Oreo shake was really delious. And our server was really sweet and friendly. Thank you."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Red Robin since I left the DMV area. I could never just convince my other half to go but since it was my birthday month and I was driving, off we went. 

Upon walking in and waiting to be seated, a lady approached the hostess and told her that no one had come to service her since she had been sat down and could she please move to another table. Ut-Oh! I wasn't going to complain as soon as walking in and make a fuss about not sitting in that section that lady was complaining about so I just kept my fingers crossed. 

Anyways, we were seated and quickly greeted by our server and were able to place our order pretty fast. I did ask for our fries while we waited and we received those pretty quickly.

However, I had asked for refill on fries 3 times and never, ever did I get a refill. It is not like they give you a lot anyways. It's a small handful - for the endless fries they should not be cheap and stingy. It is part of what they advertise and if it comes with my meal, I expect endless fries. Not 10 pieces. So that frustrating. 

Overall, our food came fast and was decent. Upon eating my meal, I couldn't remember why I had once really liked eating at this place. It must just have been the memories associated with coming."}
{"text":"Boy, this place is underrated. I don't know why someone would go to Applebee's or Friday's instead of this place (well, maybe I can see why someone would go to Applebee's if it were late and they were trying to score the low priced appetizers)

First of all, they have unlimited fries! They don't give you the evil eye or slower service when you ask for more, even when they know you just asked for more so you can take 'em home either. I like to put the Red Robin seasoning on them...mmm! Honestly, this is a huge plus for me...maybe that's why the wait is typically so long! 

Secondly, the free refills on lemonade is fab too. I've never ordered it, but some people I know come here largely for it, and the sips I've had are quite yummy.

Thirdly, people are eager to please. I asked the server to change *one* of the televisions to the NBA playoff game and within a minute every TV within my line of sight had the game on. That's awesome! Some places will hem and haw and filibuster and make sure that no guest in the place will be the least bit dissatisfied before changing the channel...not here! Also, I was about 1\2 to 3\4 done with my Diet Coke and the waitress brought me a new one before I even thought to ask! That was super cool!

The food is also a highlight as well. The burgers are large and the toppings are generous...I've never had anything else here, nor have I really had the urge to order anything else. The Whiskey Burger is especially good if you like a BBQ burger.

Lastly, the American flag made out of colored baseballs is awesome. Talk about a nice piece of patriotic art that isn't cheesy--I'd love to have something like that in my future man cave..."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Red Robin sooo long, they still have yummy burgers and of course the endless fries are a plus. This is definitely not the place you come to if you're eating clean. My burger was pretty good and the server was attentive. I like that you can pay for your check via a machine on the table."}
{"text":"I was shocked when I got horrible service, but clearly from the yelp reviews at this place, not the only one.

Awkwardly standing in front of the hostess a few min before she greets us because she's getting some menus together. 

Took 20 min to get the waitress to take our order. Too busy doing setting silverware down, walking away, introducing herself, walking away, saying she'll be with us shortly, walking away. We finally get her to stay and she says we need to order drinks from the computer- useful information to know 20 min ago. Then she had to take our little computer thing because it wasn't working. Finally she comes back and says she'll take our order. I order everything at once because I'm over waiting at this point.

My choc shake comes- without the metal container that always comes with it. Some random had to bring it over.

My burger comes completely wrong- takes the entire time my mother takes to eat to make mine as originally ordered. So we both eat alone even though I asked for some fries to try and eat something together and those didn't come out until my new burger. Food was good- just wish you could eat with the party you arrive with.

Had to basically jump on the waitress to get anything- order placing, ranch, refill, to go boxes- I finally just asked for the check when my burger came right and my mother was waiting on me just so we could get out of there. 


Horrible service. Horrible."}
{"text":"Good Red Robin! Service was great and the food delicioso!  Not a high end restaurant buy a great neighborhood hang out. Great bar!!!"}
{"text":"Always a good hamburger. I had their BLTA (Bacon Lettuce Tomato and Avocado) and it was terrific. The staff was very friendly and made you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Yes, this is a chain restaurant, and maybe I shouldn't get too excited over a standard hamburger chain-but what can I say? I love french fries! And Red Robin gives you bottomless steak fries. That's right, I said bottomless. steak. fries.  Delicious.

Oh, and the beer is always so cold that ice chips float in it. For those of you that enjoy that sort of thing."}
{"text":"This location was the absolute worst! I am only giving 1 star because that is the lowest option possible. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Friday night. That being said, a wait time was expected. My name and phone number was taken down and we grabbed a seat. Little did we know we were sitting down to watch the show of everyone that came in after us of the same party size (2) be sat before us. After waiting over 30 minutes (quoted 15-20) we just left because neither of us are very confrontational. In addition to that, after leaving we never received a text that our table was ready. This location needs new management ASAP."}
{"text":"I've been to several locations across PA, and from my experience, the quality is about the same from store to store, so I'll just review the chain itself rather than this particular restaurant. Staff members are friendly, the quality of the food is good, and the restaurant is family and large-group friendly. Regarding their burgers, they have a good variety lined up, but the burgers themselves aren't as filling as they seem. Thankfully, they offer unlimited fries to offset this. Non-alcoholic drinks and cocktails are good, too. (The chili I had at this location was on the salty side though.) Overall, I don't think you can go wrong eating at a Red Robin."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good. We had a good server especially for the size party we had. The endless French fries saves the day especially with kids. I ordered the sangria which wasn't that great so I switched to a regular glass of wine. My friend ordered a margarita and said it was good. This place is great for families and is super kid friendly. My kids walked out with a balloon and full tummies. I would come back again. This is a good go to place to eat with the family."}
{"text":"I had the Sriracha burger, fries and some ice tea.  What a surprise when they said that my meal was on them and that they wish Houston well!

The burger was juicy and full of what I love - tomato, lettuce, fried onions.  The fries are always good.  Thank you Melissa!"}
{"text":"This is a consistently decent burger chain.  It is a little in the pricey side but you leave full.  I love the Shroom burger with Swiss cheese with the endless sweet potato fries.  A nice large burger smothered with mushrooms and melty cheese.  A little pink for a burger ordered medium but nothing to complain about.  The hubby had some BBQ burger which was huge and the daughter had a guacamole bacon burger.  Those were ample sized burgers and they got endless potato fries.  I had a seasonal cocktail which was good - gingerbread and whiskey.  The others had peach and pomegranate teas which the waitress kept refilled.  Interesting point of sale in the table where you can order items and the server brings them.  You can also pay with that.  Kind of nice."}
{"text":"Wow! This place has definitely decided not to take care of its customers! Cold fries, incorrect appetizers that were only delivered with the meal. No follow up from the waitress and she forgot twice to bring the little extras we asked for. It will be a long time before I return!"}
{"text":"Food is good, if you've been to a Red Robin then you know what I'm talking about.  Hearty portions w/ fresh ingredients... not as fresh as you may find at some of the finer dining, but this is a chain restaurant we're talking about so it's all good in my books.

I had the Prime Rib Dip which was relatively fun to eat bite after bite.  The prime rib was definitely not gourmet but it was very passable.  The Au Jus dip was flavorful.. and the steak fries were very satisfactory.

Again, food is Red Robin food, typical and good.

The service was great! Our server was quick, polite and actually conversed with us about bowling--a definite plus to meet somebody w/ some personality.

Our server also split our bill for us individually and with a smile too (when I do this, I typically run into a little bit of non-verbal body language that tells me my server is mildly perturbed)! 

Check out was a breeze and the experience was fun.  Once again, another experience that makes me enjoy Cleveland's hospitality."}
{"text":"I have always liked the food at Red Robin. My husband and I have been regulars at the Irvine Spectrum location for the past few years when we lived in California. So I am kind of disappointed that there are only a few locations here in Nevada. 

Here are some of my favorites on the menu:
1. Creamy Artichoke & Spinach Dip: I think the best one is at CPK, but this comes in at a close second! I could eat this as a meal.
2. Clucks & Fries
3. Caesar's Chicken Wrap
4. BLTA Croissant (Bacon, Lettuce, Turkey, & Avocado)
5. Freckled Lemonade
6. Bottomless Steak Fries - of course!

What really disappointed me about this location was the service. Our server wasn't too friendly and it took her a while to finally come to our table and take our order. I ordered the Caesar's Chicken Wrap, which comes with melon and steak fries. I told her \"No melon, just fries.\" Well, apparently No melon = More melon and NO FRIES! I was disappointed when I got my order, which was delivered to us by another employee. Since our server was nowhere in sight, my husband and I just shared the fries that he got with his burger. We figured it was bottomless anyway, and would just order more if needed. Also, there were no utensils or napkins on our table so we had to ask for those as well. The Red Robin restaurants in California always gave us a set of utensils wrapped in a napkin as soon as we sat down. 

The food here is great! Too bad the service is pretty horrible."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that Red Robin was opening at Downtown Summerlin. We used to dine at Red Robin often when living in California. Who doesn't love their bottomless steak fries? However, after moving to Las Vegas, it became a rare treat. I know they had a location in The Galleria and somewhere in the Centennial area, which are not convenient to where I live. 

After dining here several times, I have to say that I am very disappointed with both the food and the service. Maybe its the location, but the food isn't as good as I remember. The menu has definitely changed over the years. The Artichoke and Spinach Dip used to be large enough for a full meal. It also used to come with small pieces of garlic bread. This was very delicious back in the day, but now it is horrible - very sour and can't taste the artichoke or cheese at all! It almost tasted like chips with mayo. Gross. The bottomless steak fries used to be awesome as well. Nowadays, they don't even care to cook them very well and are horribly soggy. The generous portions of the fries have now been cut down to about 10 fries per plate. Surprisingly, some of my favorites like the BLTA Croissant, the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap and the Clam Chowder are still pretty tasty. I would also like to point out that the fruit salad here is awesome! Apples, Mandarin Oranges, Pineapples and Strawberries. Everything that I like! I love fruits, but I really can't stand Cantaloupe and Honeydew Melon. 

Service here has consistently been bad and very slow. After the hostess sits us at our table, it seems like the wait for our server is usually about 20 minutes. Then when she finally shows up, we give her our drink and food orders right away because she took so damn long. Then what happens? Our appetizer arrives at our table before our drinks. Ugh, really?! Most of the servers do not even care to check up on us. Luckily, Red Robin has those Ziosk devices at every table so you can pay without having to wait for your server to bring you the check.

Come on guys, you have been open in the mall for a while now, time to get your sh!t together!!"}
{"text":"Not worth it.

I went to this Red Robin yesterday with 2 other people. Upon arriving, the host seated the group before us then disappeared for around 5 minutes. Honestly, that was a sign. That was a 5 minute sign to leave that we just ignored. Upon coming back she was rather disdainful. She proceded to seat us in the bar area though one of the members in our party was obviously under 21. We requested another seat, and though the resteraunt was not very crowded she sat us at a small table towards the outer aisle underneath a large light. When we went to order our drinks (The best thing about this meal) the waitress placed our silverware on the table. It appeared to have water stains and bits of muck on it, so we requested new kind. To this she responded \"Well they all kinda look like that...Sooooo. I'll try to find you the cleanest ones.\" That's not exactly an excuse. At this point i was seriously questioning the cleanlinest of this resteraunt. Despite that, i went on to order. We started out with 2 flavorless apps (These zuchini sticks and mini pretzels... I do not recommended.) Then we went on to order our burgers. I've had much better, I'm not sure why people rave about this place. After paying for our check suddenly the waitress ran back to inform us that we had recieved the wrong check. She handed us a much higher one then proceded to hover in the area until we payed. Overall, i regret not going somewhere else. I could have had a better lunch at Mcdonalds"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. If you plan on coming here expect for something to be incorrect and slow service. Save your time and money and go somewhere else. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. It arrived after waiting for 30 minutes and it was black and hard as a rock. Completely burnt and inedible. They remade the burger. I waited another 15-20 minutes and it arrived not burnt this time but without bacon. My husband asked for water twice before we got it. We asked for more sweet potato fries and received regular fries. Lastly, no adjustment was made to my check or even a visit from the manager. I used to be a restaurant manager and in this case I would have visited the table and removed the price of the burger from the check. Goodbye, Red Robin."}
{"text":"Excellent!! I have never had any problems with Red Robin but last night experience was over the top good. We get there about 4 pm and it's already pretty busy. But we only had to wait 5 minutes so not bad at all. Once we were seated we were treated by our waiter Andres (sorry if I butchered your name) He was very nice and got our order back right away. Since they were busy, took longer then usual for food to be served. Normally that would be bad but Andres kept our drinks full and brought their yummy fries to keep the kids happy. I loved one of the dipping sauces and he took notice so kept that coming. Having a waiter analyze and do stuff as he notices versus having to stock down a waiter and ask for things was amazing. Will definitely be back to this location. Good job Red Robin for hiring Andres!!!"}
{"text":"RED ROBIN! YUMMMMM.
I dined here today, to recieve my Free Birthday Burger. The burger I chose, was the A.1.® Peppercorn burger. My server Angelita, suggested Garlic Herbed Fries for my side. Both items were fantastic. That A.1. sauce & the onion roll, truly added to the flavor of the meal. My Royalty Membership, sure brought the price down. I'm looking forward, to returning in the near future, and trying one of their Brew Infusions. Till then, CHEERS!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend LOVES this place. I like it because they always have amazing customer service. We went this last week, it was suuuper busy and they forgot our onion rings and bacon on our burger. BUT the manager came by apologized and took it off our bill without even asking. I thought that was very nice of him! We will go back because of the customer service."}
{"text":"Bottomless fries and some killer sauces in which to skinny dip each fry. 

Burgers are overrated and overpriced but they're pretty good."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this is the best overall burger joint and casual dining restaurant in Las Vegas or even the country. Why? Three big reasons: One, the offerings will fill you up unlike some restaurants that still leaves you hungry again within 2 hours. Two, the rewards program that not only you can earn points to get the free burger but also automatically get the free burger on your birthday. Three, is the endless French fries or potato wedges. You can order chicken and veggie burgers also. Just the point you can get the best burger with endless fries if this restaurant was around when I was a kid, I be like what's a McDonald."}
{"text":"I want CampFire sauce for my fries!! Bring a Red Robin to Hawaii!!"}
{"text":"Well, This is a hard one to write because there is not much to say....which I think says it all!  The food is hit and miss, sometimes the burgers are decent, sometimes not so good.  The appetizer menu is a little more consistent, but how hard are onion rings and fries?  I always seem to walk out of here with a bill that doesn't seem to fit the quality of food the price should warrant.  The employees don't seem to be real thrilled to work there either. Again, not that anyone is ever rude, just kind of blah!"}
{"text":"Apparently this restaurant cannot function with all the tables full.  14 empty tables. Spaces available
At the bar. 16 people Waiting to be seated. Being told it's a 20-25 min wait to be seated
Seriously it's burgers and fries how difficult is it to run this restaurant"}
{"text":"Love this place....food is normally good. I will say with all the sauces you should toast the burger buns so they aren't soggy....other than that it's always good."}
{"text":"They get 3 stars becAuse the food is consistent and good. There service though is sooooo hit and miss which is why they don't get 5 stars. When it is a miss it's absolutely horrendous and tonight wasn't even our servers fault necessarily. They just didn't have enough servers. We had to wait 10 minutes alone just to get a drink order. Then it took setting our glasses up on the center shelf just to get a refill. I half expect that kind of service on a weekend, but a Wednesday night is ridiculous. It makes me want to drive farther just so I can get better service at another location."}
{"text":"We are a very regular to the red robin chain.. But at this location I feel they are paying less attention to detail to the customers wishes.. This happened to me twice within a span of 7 days.. 

Otherwise the food is good. 

Kindly look into this issue."}
{"text":"Didn't feel welcome because my server never smiled..He told me he wasn't my server, that I wasn't in his station and that my server hadn't even clocked in yet ..He never came back after we got our food. We ate and paid the bill when we left we seen our server outside so that explains why he never came back ..I was a server most of my life . I also was a certified trainer (I trained new servers) I am now a general manger of a restaurant so I know how I am supposed to be treated and that did not happen today ...He most definitely would have gotten a bigger tip if the service would have been better.."}
{"text":"Really, it's just ok. Not bad, not great. The waitstaff isn't that attentive, and the food's just ok. 

When we were there last, my girlfriend told the waiter that she didn't like what she ordered and he just kinda laughed and walked away. We don't think that he understood what she said and laughed anyway but it was still pretty awkward."}
{"text":"Just ok.  

The above being said, quality relative to price...bad.
Value relative to price...bad.

There's an In and Out near by...better burger and waaaaaayyyyyy cheaper."}
{"text":"Red Robin is one of my favorite restaurants, but this location was very disappointing. I placed a to-go order and had to talk to several staff members before getting any help. After half an hour of waiting, I got home to cold food, and only ONE patty on my DOUBLE burger. Would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Friendly service by the waitress and good place to watch sports on high tech tv's with an inviting atmosphere and a breezy and easy to pay system. I would definitely go there again in the future!"}
{"text":"For a Red Robin restaurant this is a standard one. Nothing overly special about it, same good food as all the others. With this one being in a mall makes parking challenging sometimes.

Went right in and sat at the bar and ordered lunch. Within fifteen minutes had the Royal Red Robin. Cooked to order and the taste was as expected. The waitress/bartender was attentive. The Lady who brought my Burger came back a couple times to see if there were any issues, which was a nice touch. Bonus points for stopping by when my mouth want full.

Next time an in Vegas will come back to this one, and will go to one in another place when come across a Red Robin."}
{"text":"This place is riculously busy, are food is not always delivered fast and in tonight's case it was delivered cold.....   the thing that is good about this place is that they act quickly to make it right and unlike many big chains the food is good, fresh and it doesnt seem prepackaged and proportioned.   The manager hustles like crazy and makes sure everything is operating properly and the waiters-waitresses hustle and are very attentive.   Sometimes eating out is about feeding your hunger, sometimes it is just to get a break and not having to cook.   These guys do a great job of meeting both of those needs with good food and great service"}
{"text":"This place is great - and even better, you get a free meal on your birthday - which is what we did. It was the hubs birthday so we came in for his free birthday meal.  The strawberry lemonade is so good - we order it every time.  The strawberries in the glass are so sweet - I probably could eat them all day. I ordered the mushroom and swiss burger, medium rare.  The husband ordered the bleu cheese burger, medium rare.  They were both delicious - juicy and very flavorful.  Our server was extremely nice and refilled our bottomless strawberry lemonades promptly.  Their steak fries are also great and I love how they have the special seasoning for the fries already on the table."}
{"text":"I mainly go to Red Robin when I have a my Freckled Lemonade craving.  Then I think about which burger I want - which almost always ends up with the Shroom Burger.  The mushrooms are grilled to perfection and it's always so tasty and juicy.  The unlimited fries are always a hit and I love steak fries.  My son had the kids pasta with butter and a side of apples.  He devoured the pasta and asked for more.  We were willing to pay for the pasta, but they said it was not a problem and they wouldn't charge us for it.  That was nice of them.  Service in general was great and we'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in AGES! I had a gift card I needed to use so I headed there to save a bit of money after a pretty extravagant weekend.

We arrived and were greeted very boisterously and taken to our booth. Man, was this place poppin' on a Sunday night. Super super busy, but it didn't impede service whatsoever.

I ordered the Bonzai Burger (just like old times) with a cup of clam chowder. My fella got the All American Burger (he's a sucker for a burger with an egg on top). My burger was cooked just as I had requested and it tasted just as I had remembered. It was a little lacking in teriyaki sauce, but it had just the right amount of all the ingredients. My clam chowder was pretty tasty as well. Nothing gourmet obviously, but it quenched my soup craving for the evening and for that I was appreciative. My fella enjoyed his burger quite a bit as well. We're both big fans of the endless refills on steak fries available. Not that we took full advantage of that, but it's good in theory.Try the fries with some honey mustard. Yum!

The service was fast and extremely friendly and I always keep an eye out for the actual \"Red Robin\" to come out on weekends. That always makes me smile. 

All in all, good experience."}
{"text":"First off I think my score is on the high side but my experience was better than a 2 so...went on a Saturday around 5:30. Four adults, three children in our party. Amazingly we did not have to wait for a table. I love the decor and vibe of this place. 

Gene was at our table to take drink and appetizer orders and explain the rewards program they have. Apps came out fairly quickly. Onion ring tower and fried pickles. Rings were good, pickles were way to salty for my liking. The only problem we had was when they brought our apps they also brought plates, well one of the plates had food on it sandwiched between 2 others. Not dried on food the washer didnt clean full on wet ranch and half eaten food. Almost like it looked like the stack of plates weren't used at another table and instead of washing they reused not realizing they had been used and stacked. Off putting and I only had one ring and one pickle.

Ok on to our entrees. Kids all ordered pizza. They ate it so no complaints. My husband ordered a plain burger with bacon. He said it was more medium rare than medium. I ordered the 4 cheese melt with bacon and tomato. My food looked good but the bread was hard and looked like it had sat before being brought to the table. The cheese no longer melty. Other adults had the teriyaki chicken. looked good but they only ate half each. All adults had average frozen steak fries for our side

Gene was nice and informative but the place was packed and I think he had a few too many large tables because the service was lacking a little. Drinks ran dry quickly and took a while to get refilled, but to his defense he was always working the dining room and visible.

It was my first time at a Red Robin. For 7 People with 2 apps, entrees and non-alcoholic bevs it was $100 without tip. I don't think my dining experience was worth a hundred and ever since I ate there my stomach has been in distress.   I am not sure if we will return which makes me a little sad since we live so close."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times and have always had great service and great food. They have really good onion rings and the burgers are all great I've sampled most of them. I've noticed though that they are getting a little stingy on the fries. Great place for burgers!"}
{"text":"5 stars for chocolate shake.... best in town."}
{"text":"Some years ago I ate at a Red Robin in California. Even though this place was only a few miles from the house I have not been there.
Seems everyone is advertising a gourmet burger. If it is a gourmet burger you can charge 3 to 4 dollars more. I looked up gourmet burger and read what three different people said. The one that made the most since was any burger that is more than hamburger, lettuce, tomato, cheese (American cheese which to me is plastic cheese), can be called a gourmet burger. Which does not mean it is any better tasting than a regular hamburger done right.
I don't remember the exact burger I ordered but I asked for it without a bun and no fries. They did what I thought was the right thing and said I could have a salad instead of the fries. Nice!! Most places will do this but want an extra dollar or more. Hats off to Red Robin. They sandwiched the burger between two pieces of lettuce that consisted of about three leafs each side. Again hats off to Red Robin I was impressed with the presentation. 
As they say two out of three aint bad. I am having a hard time putting a finger on it but the customer service could of been better and something abut the layout of the restaurant did not appeal to me. Price is another factor. 
I will probably see them again and would encourage others to give them a try."}
{"text":"I like the food or I would have given this one star. There were many tables available but yet we had to wait about 10-15 minutes. Then we were sat to wait another 5-10 minutes for a server, then close to another 5 minutes for drinks. I understand that someone can be busy, however the cardinal rule of waiting on kids is serve the kids first. We asked if some fries could come out to get my young one started, and the manager did oblige. The kid meal came out with rest of the food.

My main issue is that we would need something and then someone would drop off after awhile or not come back and check to make sure everything was ok. Wrong side items with food, wrong drinks, but because our server was busy, we just went with it. I would normally recommend but I am not sure if this was a fluke service or this location is not equipped to handle a decent size crowd."}
{"text":"Shady much? We went in for lunch on Sunday. After the back messed up my burger, the waiter argued with me about if it was the right burger or not. Then, after a 10 minute wait for the right burger, he stated he would remove the burger from the bill for the wait. 
Here's where it gets shady. He comes with the bill and says manager wouldn't approve the removal. Alright, no biggie. But then he takes the bill back and offered to pay $5 on it, but brings back a different bill instead for $45. I pay with credit, he turns around and charges my card for $60 and hands me back the receipt which says it was ran for the $60, but no itemized bill. Didn't say a thing, brought it to me quickly with his head down, dropped it and ran. Couldn't find him after that to clear it up. 
I didn't much care for the wait and I'm not upset that my order was put in wrong. I'm not even put off by being told they'd clear the burger off my receipt, then them not doing it. Instead, I'm a bit worried at how shady that waiter was, changing out receipts, charging more then he was supposed to, then disappearing instead of speaking up about it. If he's acting shady about a receipt, I wonder what else he is doing...."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, the waitress(Sam) kind of made us feel rushed by! She asked us if we wanted dessert after maybe 5 minutes of having our food, she also just grabbed me wife's plate w/o asking if she was done! Food was good but the waitress on the other hand wasn't!!"}
{"text":"Pros: bottomless fries and service is good
Cons: pretzel bites were terrible. 1/2 over cooked and 1/2 undercooked. It's like they were deep fried and the forgot to flip them - yuck.  
Basic cheeseburger is good. Ordered a bit of pink but was well cooked.  Tasty but not outstanding. 
Beer was cold, happy hour made it worth while. 
With so many choice these guys better step it up"}
{"text":"Boneless wings are good and the buzz sauce had a sneaky heat after a minute. The ensinata chicken had a good spice the side salad is right size.  This is not the full review."}
{"text":"Decently good food and service. We got in and out which is what we were looking for, but nothing that was WOW about the service/food."}
{"text":"There are some 3 star reviews that I write that are giving the benefit of the doubt to a place where I had pretty high expectations but that didn't measure up in some way.  This 3 star review is more of the, don't expect much from a chain place like this but consistently walk away pleasantly surprised.

When I come here, it's usually around lunchtime on a weekday and I find myself constantly amazed that they stay open because it's rarely very busy.  They must do a brisk dinner business to keep up.  I find their burgers to be thick, juicy with a good beefy flavor and consistently cooked to the temp I ask for.  I also like the fat steak fries that come with the burgers but never have taken them up on a free refill.

All in all, I can name a number of burger places I would choose over Red Robin but, RR is a solid A-OK for me when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"What I like about Red Robin is that it's consistent. I love the unlimited strawberry lemonade and french fries. They have recently added certain new burgers and it seems they're trying to bring more people in. That's fine and the burger was just average. The beers are typically domestic and there's not a ton of variety. They have lots of frou frou drinks if you like that sort of thing and it's good for kids, including a kid menu and balloons. This location is just ok, but also gets really busy since it's next to the move theatre."}
{"text":"We went here for my daughter's birthday a few days ago. I was really interested because I've been to some very modernized Red Robin's in my day. The only thing my 4 year old wanted was Mac 'n Cheese and there's is good. 

What do I like? I like the bottomless steak friends (believe me, they are bottomless!) and the bottomless speckled lemonade. Yummy strawberries in the drink itself! 

Typically the burgers are good and I am picky, but this time mine was under done and that really bothered me. Also, our waitress was not very fast at all. She barely even came and when she did bring more lemonade, she just dropped it by without asking if we needed anything else. 

They do have a free sundae for birthdays, but they didn't try to upsale dessert to the rest of the party before bringing it out (they could've made a few more bucks if they had!)

Overall, not bad, but I've been to better."}
{"text":"As soon as we entered Red Robin we were greeted with a very pleasant and friendly host that seated us.
Out waitress was very professional and on top of everything.
I have to say the WHOLE STAFF was AWESOME!  They really made our family evening a hoot!
The new manager of that store is gonna be quite successful with his hands right in with all his staff.
Thank you for the many laughs tonight Red Robin, I needed it!"}
{"text":"The burgers were good. Our server, Nikita, was not. The worst thing she did besides not checking on us regularly (with the refills) was when she brought our 3 baskets of bottomless fries, she had them stacked on top of each other and sat them on the edge of the table still stacked, and walked away. Most servers would have at least distributed them. She didn't want to be bothered I guess. The burgers were a for sure 4 stars but the service was a 0."}
{"text":"Going there once is enough. Red Robin is an outdated chain that fails to redeem itself. My server was great, and she did her best to promote the menu. However, the overpriced burgers and small dollop of fries was too much to bear. Even with the \"endless\" fries, it's just not worth $10+ for a burger."}

{"text":"Had horrible service last night. Appetizer was forgotten, burgers weren't cooked correctly and my kids sides were forgotten. Manager gave us a discount but i think everyone got a discount. Cooks should be fired and server was so forgetful. Not a good dinner. Definitely not going back."}

{"text":"A recent visit to Red Robin this past weekend was about as good as I would hope. The wait time was less than estimated, we had a nice big table for our party of 6, food was delicious and came out quickly, and our server Amanda M. was best I've come across in a long time. To boot, it was my daughter's 8th birthday and she had a nice big ice cream sundae on the house. Great experience."}
{"text":"Love coming to red robin but Thier service can be a little slow... we have found coming closers to an hour before they close gets us better faster service (guessing it's cuz they want to get off on time) don't sit by the bar we have nvr had good service there but sitting in the main area the waitresses seem to be friendlier and more prompt. I love Thier fries but don't recommend the appetizers they are extremely small portions for such prices."}
{"text":"I tried Red Robin for the first time today and I'm glad I did. I got right in since I was flying solo and sat at the bar. Had I taken the wife and kids I would have had a 15 to 20 minute wait. The bartender was super friendly engaging everyone at the bar in conversation. She was quick to explain things since it was my first time there. I ordered the black and bleu burger with onion rings and got my order in about 10 minutes. The burger was cooked perfectly and tasted great. My onion rings were also very tasty. I will be going back to try other gourmet burgers and next time I think I'll try the bottomless sweet potato fries. I was not disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Red Robin?  What's not to like about this place?  They have an expansive list of specialty burgers, the service is always reasonably attentive, and endless fries.

I like the Bonzai burger and order a side of campfire sauce for the fries.  It's delicious.

People say I'm crazy, but I prefer Red Robin to BRGR and even Burgatory."}
