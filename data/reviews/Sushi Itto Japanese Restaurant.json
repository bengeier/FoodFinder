{"text":"Very good Sushi for Newmarket. Better than most in GTA. Price to quality ratio cannot be beat. Service is prompt and food tastes very good. Not the nicest looking place but who cares when it tastes this good."}
{"text":"Be Careful: We went there for lunch today 11.99 and paid dinner 19.99,  waiter gave us the dinner menu by mistake and we end up paying for his mistake. Instead he offered 10% off the next purchase.. I'm not going there again for the following reasons.
-food is too simple 
-no organization 
-takes long time to get the order ready 
-the forget half of your orders 
-2 dollar extra for a drink (extra hidden cost)
-mix up in menus (keep an eye open)
-maki rolls are too dry 

I Don't Recommend this place"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant. The sushi is good and it's a very reasonable price. They don't have a large variety of drink options and the place is a bit small but other than that it is great."}
{"text":"Organized birthday dinner at Sushi Itto and I am glad I did it here and not other high end places that charge us a fortune for the quality of food that they serve.

Overall decor is a bit dated 2/5 

Service I would give it a 4.5/5, Wonderful service overall the owners themselves were serving our table and they kept checking on us to make sure that everything was up to our standards the -0.5 star was there was a moment we had to wait for tea 

Now the FOOD ! AMAZINGLY GOOD !!!! 5/5

We didn't opt for their AYCE menu instead I called ahead to see how flexible were they for a la carte, the owners explained that they could order whole fishes for the event because we had 12 people ( i had to leave a deposit for this process tho ) we got a fish from Japan called flounder for m/p, along with some other sashimi's like sweet shrimp, scallops, octopus, salmon, etc the ingredients were so fresh and so good ! 

We also ordered their signature rolls, and some sushi, their rolls were AMAZING ! I wanted more but was too full already.

The group of were VERY full after all of the sashimi, sushi, and rolls it was a great night, thanks to the owners and wonderful staff for making this birthday so special !

We will be back to try their AYCE menu next time ! hope it's up to standards as their a la carte.

I've taken pictures of the menu along with their AYCE prices."}
{"text":"Stuck between love and hate for this place because the food was GREAT but the service could've been better"}
{"text":"Just back from lunch from Itto Sushi: upset, disappointed and I'm sure I will never go back. First, there is not much selection in the menu, second, their maki and rolls are very mediocre: small, bland, look sloppy and not appetizing. My husband and I were seated at a table for four guests, so one of the waiters put a dirty, nasty looking plastic box on our table!!!! And started collecting dirty dishes from the other table. We were shocked!!! Then they brought seafood curry, which was full of crab sticks and a few pieces of white fish and one shrimp. It did not look like curry at all! I had to ask my husband to eat it, because I was disgusted just by its look. All I can say: this is the worst sushi place in Newmarket."}
{"text":"Love Sush Itto.  I can call myself a regular... must eat there at least once a week.   Just can't beat 11 dollars and change for \"all you can eat\" sushi.  Always very fresh.  Mind you, I wish that the menu would offer more..."}
{"text":"Rediscovered Sushi Itto this weekend after a failed attempt at Solo Sushi Ya where we encountered the worst service ever.  The chef barked at me then hung up when I called and the lady when I called back refused my order and told me to order 2 days in advance.  They don't deserve my money.  Sushi Itto was our go-to place for a while, then we tried a few others that did not last long (Kimchi House, Kazi, Taka) but were very happy to find our way back.  Excellent delivery service on a Saturday, great rolls, and very fresh sashimi.  Our old favourite is back to our new favourite!"}
{"text":"This is a great Sushi restaurant! 

I have been eating here since 2003 and have seen a few different owners! I have eating at both the lunch and dinner all you can eat buffets. The items are fresh, service fast and the all you can eat buffet price is a great deal."}
{"text":"Been to Sushi Itto multiple times, have always enjoyed it, but tonight was the best yet. The server was talkative, funny, friendly and helpful. The rest of the staff was friendly too. The sushi was fresh as usual. Tried the Yummy Yam speciality roll for the first time and it's unreal, highly recommend - yam, rice, avocado, and banana, with mango sauce on top. Awesome."}
{"text":"Middle of the road - all you can eat sushi.  Its not bad its what you get for a $12 lunch special.  Servers are always friendly.   But taste of sushi isnt over the top and fairly bland selection."}
{"text":"Went in today, easy location to find. Parking not bad
Order with iPads ( super annoying when it comes to them having to put pin in for it to send , but Cynthia across street doessame as well)

Food was delicious sushi was fresh and good.... green dragon roll had lettuce in it??.... anyways food was really good. 
Found it interesting how they only use one big plate per few items instead of bunch little ones... don't mind it. 

Food was good. Dessert was 6 ice creams and fried banana 

Weekday lunch 14.99 
Defiantly will go back 

(-10% Cash.)"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is well presented. It can get pricey per item but the ayce is great. Good service. Been going here for years. I usually get the yakitori don and its perfect every time. I prefer it with no meat. I've gotten chicken before and it tasted horrible so I stick to veggie."}
{"text":"It's an excellent choice for an all you can eat buffet for about $12.
The spicy avocado roll was exceptionally good as well as the green tea ice cream.

Portions are small though, but you can always order more of what you like. Good for a light but filling lunch."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, the salmon sashimi was not bad, sushi was very basic, very greasy tempura, not a a large selection the fish quality overall is not that good. Service is good, and miso soup was good. For all you can eat I would rather spend 20$ on quality ala cart restaurant, ichiban not all you can eat in Aurora is way better."}
{"text":"Great prices for sushi.  I've been here many times with friends and really enjoyed myself. However, I've found the last few times the food has been 3 stars rather than the usual 4 stars hence my rating."}
{"text":"By far the most disgusting food i have ever tasted. Ordered for 5 people we took a couple bites, almost puked, payed the 100+$ tab and left immediately. Do yourself the favour and don't come here."}
{"text":"mediocre at best 
2 hairs in our food
dry seaweed and bland rolls
if you're a bottomless pit without any taste buds this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Place has a crazy lunch all-u-can eat Japanese deal. Such a surprise. Was packed! Seems like a secret waiting to get out. White Tune Spicy handroll maki is da bomb."}
{"text":"It was only an okay experience at Sushi Itto. What I liked was the server reviewed our order with us before she sent it to the kitchen. We didn't realize we ordered 60 pieces worth of maki and she took the time to fix it and help us understand the menu. Compared to other sushi places in the area the presentation was not very presentable. The rice to fish ratio was not ideal. Also the sushi took way longer to reach our table than the other items on the menu. Taste needs improvement. The basic California roll did not even taste like any that I've had in the past. I won't be returning to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service been coming here for years. The ownership has changed a few time but they keep doing the right thing. Unlike other local establishments they should use this place as a model on how to keep customers coming back."}
{"text":"5+ stars
I absolutely love this place! I always come here with my brother and my friends and we have become regulars! I love the idea of the card with 6 or more times you eat= free meal! Nice! 
Service is always quick, friendly and the owner is very nice! 
Sashimi and spicy crispy salmon maki rolls are superb (very crispy). I enjoy this place so much I come here a couple of days in a row sometimes."}
{"text":"I don't know if we chanced to come across this place on a bad night but we are not coming back. The rainbow roll was dry and no amount of soy sauce could help. And we should've asked to remove dynamite roll from the bill: the shrimp tempura was cold and tasted like it was going bad. Many sushi places pre-cook tempura shrimp when they expect a busy night (and I so hate it when they do that). I think this place has decided to push the envelope further and cook their tempura several days before it's served."}
{"text":"Calling all salmon lovers!

If you're on the hunt for fresh salmon, search no more. Sushi Itto has best salmon selection in Newmarket. They aren't chincy on the sashimi cuts and they have really started to turn their selections around. A make over was needed and they listened! A washroom reno and a menu upgrade was all it took to win back this customer. Although they are still trying to incorporate new flavours, they do appreciate their customers and can ace your sushi faves. I wouldn't recommend this place for special items but I can promise you won't leave with an upset stomach and your foot on the gas pedal."}
{"text":"Decent, and at the price of $12 all you can eat, it's a good deal.  The deluxe menu has many more options, but is $20, which is still pretty good.

I think they need a few more options even on the basic menu, as my wife won't eat fish, but likes teriyaki and tempura.  Since I have a tenancy to bring my wife with me when I go places, it makes for a hard sell to my wife as to why we would come here for lunch, I can't justify spending $20 each for lunch.  By myself, or with someone that enjoys sushi I would go back.

You get what you pay for here for sure, if you want a wider selection, it's there if you are willing to pay the extra, but the basic menu was just that, basic.

the rolls were on the small side, the fish was cut a little slim, but it's all you can eat, so it just means they want to roll more and cut more i guess.

Overall a good experience, as the staff were all very friendly and quick to bring everything when they could.  unfortunately for my wife they said they only had one guy in the kitchen, so, her teriyaki and tempura took a while to come out.  Luckily we weren't in a rush to get anywhere, but still a little annoying."}
{"text":"Mediocre but super cheap AYCE sushi for lunch. Lunch is only 13.99, plus if you're paying by cash you get 10% off. 

The sushi here is very basic and quality of the fish doesn't seem too fresh. I've opted for the fried food and vegetarian rolls just to be safe. 

The fried food have a lot of batter on it... the fried Yam was super thin. I legit couldn't taste any yam but the fried batter itself.

I got the seafood udon and it was super bland! It tasted like water, udon, and some random seafood pieces. I didn't finish it.

Service here is okay... they use the iPads for ordering which is kind of slow...

You pay for what you get."}
{"text":"***New owners*** quantities and serving portions substantially reduced. Attention to detail isn't there anymore, sashimi pieces poorly cut (big lump of tuna stuck together [3 pieces] in party tray.

There are better sushi joints around with better quality an quantity."}
{"text":"Bad sushi horrible sashimi (smells stale and tastes bad), vegetables were just tossed on like nasty. We got kalbi beef was super stale and nasty. Bad place. I wouldn't recommend - take elsewhere"}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! I have been to countless sushi restaurants and can immediately know the difference between fresh and quality sashimi vs. stale. The rolls, maki, and sashimi here at Itto Sushi Newmarket are on the extreme side of stale. The raw fish/sashimi itself was disgusting and slimey, to the point that I was throwing up. It has stale and slimy texture with very fishy taste. Do yourself a favor and dine at another sushi place if you don't want to get sick.

The service was also rude and horrible. This place has completely gone downhill. They do not care about the guests they are serving, only there to clock in time and get out as soon as their shift is done. The Manager was supposed to be \"inside and busy\" and do not want to meet with customers when there is a complaint about quality of the food. Probably because they are hiding something... and that is indeed correct. The server confessed that the owner/management do not even eat raw food, so how do they do quality control over their raw food? This is completely flabbergasting. It will only be a matter of time when there will be news that people were getting sick from eating here!"}
