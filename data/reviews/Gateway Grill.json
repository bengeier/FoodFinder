{"text":"Saturday night, very little wait time. Waitress very friendly and knowable about the menu . Weekly specials including prime rib. Over 100 beers to choose from. Grilled salmon cooked perfectly, tender and moist.Garlic and butter fantastic.buffalo chicken wrap\"fried heaven\"   Mixed drinks very good. Every seat is full, lots of regulars.over 12 big screens t.v's."}
{"text":"My wife and her parents went for a late lunch on Sunday, 2/23. Not a good  experience!  First we were seated in a booth with cold air blowing on us. We were moved. After a fairly long wait, our food came but the chicken and French fries were both cold in my wife's chicken salad. I had the fire grilled chicken breast which was extremely dry as well. While the beer selection was excellent my draft did not arrive until we were all done with our meals. So I had a pint draft to finish while the three others just had to wait.  Then finally we had to wait for the waitress to collect the bill while she cleaned off several tables.  What a mess."}
{"text":"Good food, and good prices, Their pizza is great it is called the pittsburgher, the only drawback is that there is a server, an old woman that gives really bad service, I have never seen her working eveningi shif,  I have only seen her working day shift,  but if you get her, ask for a different server, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Not enough service people for the crowd that they had.  Took over 1/2 hour  to get my barely warm sandwich and my husband to get someone else's plate of food.  And one of the waitresses was walking around without her hair tied back- isn't there a health rule about that?! Doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Had steak and eggs. Ordered med rare got well done. Quick fix good meal. Service was very nice."}
{"text":"Fabulous fall-off-the bone wood-fired ribs. Ive never had better. Prime rib also very good. Steaks and chops excel  as do burgers. Only complaint is noise level; conversation is difficult. If beer is your passion, you're covered; there must be over a hundred brands available from all over the world. Prices are moderate. Unreserved recommendation. Would rate 5stars except for noise."}
{"text":"Gateway Grill has great food and friendly service. We were in town for a night and found it on Yelp, and were not disappointed. Dining area is on the small side and can be a bit noisy, but prices are reasonable and service is friendly. We had a large group of 9, and had to wait for a few tables to free up but that was expected. 
Wood fired grill adds a nice flavor to many of the foods offered. Appetizers (Ribs, potato skins, wings) were good; pizza, buffalo chicken salad, burgers all were good.

It was conveniently located near 376 and 76, so we came back for breakfast the next morning. Recommend the bacon, eggs, home fries 3.99 breakfast special with 2.75 cinnamon roll add-on  (roll is big enough to share)."}
{"text":"Good food, rowdy yet reasonable sports crowd, big beer selection.  Wings/pizza/burgers are better than very good.  Only gripe is no beer PRICES!  Totally at mercy of the unknown price list in the sky...Beer ain't cheap, but they do have beer specials, so stick to those.  (coupons often available in clipper and newspaper)  Have had great admiration for take out ladies who do a great job under enormous pressure.  I tip when taking out."}
{"text":"I went to this place expecting good food, good service, and the opportunity to brag about tutoring Antonio Brown in college. I was only able to satisfactorily meet two of those three things, which is almost good enough. The waitress was wearing a Steelers jersey, but didn't even know who Antonio Brown was when I tried to brag about helping him pass English 101! How does she not know Antonio Brown? I know him."}
{"text":"This review is based on the Wings and Service:

Sat at the bar last night about 9 PM.  The bar keeper provided average service.  She had her hands full serving drinks to the entire bar and restaurant.  Lots of workers just standing around who wanted to chat with her.  Maybe they could have helped out.  She did her best but needed help.  This is a reflection on the management.

Ordered Buffalo Hot Wings.  I give them a 6 out of 10.  They could be an 8 or 9 with some attention.  

Positives:  Good size wings with real good flavor.  A little bite while keeping real Buffalo Wing taste.  Good blue cheese.  Decent price especially during special hours.

Negatives:  The wings came out warm at best.  Plus they were a little on the soggy side.  Appears they were cooked earlier and warmed up and tossed in extra sauce.  They should have been hot if they were deep fried for my order.  Too little of the blue cheese.  Come in a little container.  Asked for more but bar keeper was too busy to get in time.

Should have sent them back but you never know what happens when they are sent back.

I will try again.  Hopefully they will be freshly cooked so they won't be soggy and luke warm.  They have real potential."}
{"text":"Great American fare!! I had the Cuban and the other person ordered the Ruben! Classic fries that were amazing too! AMAZING beer selection!! Top Notch!!  Our waitress Barbra was FANTASTIC!! So attentive and cheerful!! Made us feel welcomed to go there!! I will go again!!!"}
{"text":"Had Breakfast here..was very good and the bartender was nice and she makes a awesome Bloody Mary from scratch..
Large portions"}
{"text":"Confused where to be for seating. This is pretty much the first impression guests have and a basic of hospitality industry-greet and seat.  Salad was excellent for a \"side\", steak cooked to order over wood grill. Smell outside is fabulous!  One concern involved not honoring an Internet offer when management agreed to do so.  If you're looking for a subdued environment, don't visit!  Very boisterous and noisy with sports on every TV.  I noticed many ordering pizza and I may try sometime.  Four stars only for the above critiques of  not honoring Internet coupon and no clear area to be for seating. I'm giving it another shot soon.  Hope they read these reviews and act on them"}
{"text":"Although hours of business didn't match website we got there in time for a meal. Ribs were delicious and cheesecake was homemade. Definitely will go back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I can here on a business trip and decided just to try it out.  The staff was very friendly but busy.  As the night went on they were able to be a little more attentive.  It seems like most people sitting at the bar are regulars and know each other.  The bar had a large selection of draft and bottled beers.  They also had a large selection of liquor.  The lemonade was out of the gun so not very good but it was not horrible, just a little on the sweet side. The pizza was very good I like mine a little thinner but it was good.  The pizza was not drenched in sauce but had plenty of cheese and I mean allot of cheese.  So much that I was able to use a fork and spin the cheese a couple of times around it.  I saw the vegetable pizza that a server ordered and it looked really good.  All in all it was a good experience and I will be back.  Next time I will have a cocktail or two for yelps sake lol"}
{"text":"We had mild buffalo wings, seasoned fries, and the Pittsburgh pizza. Everything was delicious and very fast service. Probably the best waitress we've had in a long time. Our tab was about $40 after tip for the 2 of us. Pretty cheap for a good Saturday night dinner. Loved the vibe of the place. My 6 month old had tons to look at! Many tv's for games. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection! The tap list is amazing and the bottle section is mind boggling! The food was very good. The dessert was huge and my friends and I were able to split it. The staff was attentive and knowledgable about both the food and the tap selections. They went out of their way to make sure we had an accurate tap list. We've been back a few times and will continue to do so! Great neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"Great place for beer nerds, great selection of imports & crafts. Also pretty good pub food. Haven't tried any of the dinners yet."}
{"text":"Recommended by a local. Great food and service! The Pittsburgher wood fired pizza is delicious...thicker crust and tons of toppings. Nice selection of beer on tap. Salads were also good. House salad was full of great toppings. Lots of folks around us ordered ribs...must also be a favorite. Will return the next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Gateway grill for a late lunch and had a poor experience.  I opted for the French Dip with a side of fries. The sandwich was sparse on the beef(first two bites had no meat with very little on the last bite) at least I got to taste the au jus with the bun.  The fries room temperature."}
{"text":"The food is good and reasonably priced. They have a wood-fired grill and oven for certain items.

The seating is a bit crowded and it can be noisy. It's often very busy"}
{"text":"Steak salad was awful!  Not much more to say than I would not order it again.  Steak was cheap meat, cold and chewy.  Plate was too small and there were more fries than any thing else. Hey chefs, take a look at Union Grill in Oakland -- That's a good steak salad.  Not only was yours not tasty it was visually unappealing.  Two bites was it for me."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh! Be forewarned, their pizzas are a size larger than most other pizzarias. The wood fired grill cooks the food to perfection and they have a large beer selection. This is my favorite pizza in the whole world! :)"}
{"text":"Best locally owned joint in Monroeville... Only drawdown is it can draw quite a rough looking crowd sometimes"}
{"text":"Very good local diner with a bar attached.  It's actually more sports bar that feels like a diner.  Food was very good but typical diner.  I heard the ribs are excellent but didn't know until we had already received our food.  Service was quick and very friendly.  Would definitely go back again.  If you do go, get the cinnamon roll!!!  Seriously.  Made there and SO good.  :)"}
{"text":"Good place to take the family for a pizza.  The pizza's are big and cheesy with good crust.  I would not put this place in the upper echelon of pittsburgh pizza but its a good place to sit and watch a game or two while enjoying a pie.  I also recommend a bowl of the wedding soup, tasty and meaty.   The sandwiches are average and not worth getting over the pizza.  One of these days i would love to try the ribs as they smell good coming off the grill."}
{"text":"We really enjoy their Pizza and BBQ wings! They serve big! A small pizza is like a medium 8 cut at most other places. The BBQ sauce is finger licking good, especially when paired with blue cheese. Definitely worth the expen$$e!"}
{"text":"Wish they had an actual pizza menu with a few specialty pizzas. Overall, not bad though."}
{"text":"On the evening of Saturday, September 22, 2012, my wife and I stopped at Gateway Grill for dinner.  Near the end of our meal, as I finished by dark colored soda (Pepsi), I noticed a dead house fly stuck to the inside of my glass, wedged between my plastic straw and the glass itself.  There were no flies flying around the restaurant, leading me to believe  that this fly was deposited into my glass via the soda dispenser or elsewhere from the kitchen area.  I had one refill, however,  my glass had not been fully emptied before being refilled, and I am therefore fairly positive that the house fly was in my glass the entire time, resulting in my drinking a beverage containing a disease-ridden insect throughout my entire meal.

The waitress offered to take the $2.00 drink off our $37.xx bill and when we asked to speak to a manager, he offered to deduct a $5 coupon (which we told him we already had anyway and he said he'd take another $5 off if that would 'make us happy').  Clearly, this isn't a big deal to them - otherwise the entire check would have been comped.   When management was confronted, he simply stated that \"with the changing weather\" that \"this happens sometimes\" but that they \"have a service\" that handles things so that \"things like that doesn't happen.\"  When informed that it was disgusting, he then  said that they \"had a lot of customers\" that day and the \"door had been opened and closed a lot.\"

I guess other restaurants don't have people come in and out the door, as I don't have flies in my food when I eat elsewhere.  They also must not have \"changing weather\" either - Gateway Grill must be isolated in some sort of \"changing weather\" vortex making bugs a problem for them only.  It must be some sort of paradox (sense the sarcasm).  THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR BUGS IN BEVERAGES/FOOD!

Management clearly sees no problem with serving someone a beverage (and/or other food) that is infested with bugs that feed on excrement.  Therefore, it leaves me to wonder what else happens \"behind the scenes\" in the kitchen and what sort of health violations are in place.  It just makes me nauseous to think about.

This was our first and will be the only visit to \"House Fly Grill\"."}
{"text":"Food was okay but the service was terrible. Do not sit in the bar to eat as you would be better off walking over to Wendy's and eating before anyone actually waits in you. Maybe it would be better in the main dining room.??"}
{"text":"This place used to have the best pizza around. Now the crust is never consistent and always seems to be soggy on the bottom. 
Their prices have sky rocketed while quality and service has hit rock bottom. 
Yes,, they have a fair amount of beers on tap, but they always taste like a skunk's ass because they aren't flushing and cleaning the lines properly. 
Also the \"craft\" beers they claim to have are disgustingly over priced and never have the prices listed on the menu. 
This is a really sneaky way for them to screw people out of money when the check arrives. Pretty low.
Management is lackadaisical and the whole place needs a thorough cleaning."}
{"text":"Great pick your six and the food choices are yummy. Not a lot of vegetarian options, which is kind of a bummer. However, the pizza is good, and there are lots of topping options. The calzones are as big as a small child!!! Fantastic to share. The tap list is diverse and ever changing. I consider this one of the better restaurants in Monroeville because it's not a chain and it's very home style Pittsburgh, if ya know what I'm sayin' n'at."}
{"text":"We love Erin. SHE'S THE BEST!  go to this place and ask for Erin or Jess.  Jess is awesome too.  I like the way she twirks!  More twirking  please.  And can you make the hash browns crispier??? Thanks"}
{"text":"I now live out of state and I still come back here every visit.  It was a staple growing up and it's mandatory when I come back.  Burgers and wings are the way to go"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after a soccer game. Had heard the other parents talk about it. We had to wait to be seated. But the food was worth the wait. Would eat there again!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast. From Cleveland to Monroeville, glad we yelped it. I will definitely bring the family back. Waitress was very friendly and helpful. Try it if your close by."}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars. I don't know what happened to Gateway Grill. My family and I have been going there for over 15 years. The food was always good but, the place was small and there was always a wait. Then they expanded into the space next door and even recently remodeled the bathrooms.

If you are a beer drinker you will be happy to know that they offer over 700 beer selections and have 34 different drafts on tap. They also have a ton of big screen TVs to catch the Bucs, Pens or Steelers.

They offer burgers, calzones, hoagies, pizza, wraps, ribs, sandwiches, soaps, salads, seafood, steaks and much more. We have been countless times as the food is consistently good. What isn't is the service. Once you place your order your server will disappear until your food arrives and then disappear again for long periods of time after. 

If you need a drink refill or more plates or napkins you better get them while your server is at the table because you will not see them again for a while.

Some of our favorites are the burgers, wings, prime rib and pizza. The burgers are huge. The wings are well seasoned and a nice size. the prime rib is juicy and perfectly cooked and the pizza is excellent as well. If only they could get their service together.

{"text":"Good if your in the mood for sports bar food. Good hoagies, pizza ,&wings . Kind of silly they charge for extra ramequins of ranch dressing tho. Oh and I wish they had a dessert menu! If they do it must be very inconspicuous and I haven't noticed it .  ."}
{"text":"The waitress was really good and I wasn't disappointed and this was the first time I had dinner; since I always went there for breakfast. The burger and the steak was really good. Being cooked over wood gave it a great flavor. The waitress was really attentive and it was definitely a positive experience for dinner."}
{"text":"I started coming to the Gateway Grill in 2001 when I lived in the area.  Over the next few years I hit the Gateway pretty hard, enjoying steaks, wings, and burgers.  All were excellent and to top it off they have fresh cut fries.i don't get to frequent the restaurant/bar as much as I would like but when I'm in the area I stop in.

I had the privilege of eating there with my family today.  My wife and I had wings and my boys had burgers.  The wings were better than I remembered and both of my sons devoured their burgers.  Service was equally outstanding.  

Yes, the drink prices can be a little higher than they should but you aren't going to have a bad meal here.  The six pack shop is next door and there are plenty of beers on tap.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Gateway Grille in Monroeville is evidently a very popular place with the locals. I had to wait to get seated at 8 pm. There is no hostess stand or obvious place for you the stand to be seated. I had to ask where to go. 

If you don't like noisy, sports bars this isn't the place for you. There is a dull roar in here from all the people speaking.  On the walls are 17 big, flat screen TVs, all tuned, naturally, to Pittsburgh sports games. 

The menu has a good variety with reasonable prices. The food was delivered promptly. I got a calzone with sausage and mushrooms. It was very tasty. 

This place also as a bar on one side of the restaurant. The is also an adjoining package store where you can get 6-packs of beer. Reminds me of places in Philadelphia. 

All in all, it's a good place. It just loses points for the extreme loudness."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast... other food is decent as well, a little on the greasy side overall.  The coffee however is AWFUL.  I have tried it on several occasions and it's like warmed-up garbage water... blech!  Terrible.  The service can also be hit-or-miss.

*My husband insists that I add a comment about how tasty the giant cinnamon rolls are - yes, they are delicious.*"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've bern here. Its Thursday night and checking out their menu, the special tonight is a 16oz T-Bone. It e was tendern and cooked to order. My barmaid Kate was ptompt and courteous (and guys......she was nit hard to look at).  No wonder this place gets good reviews!"}
{"text":"You'll definitely pass this place not knowing it is anything special from the outside.  Parking lot is small.  I went during the afternoon, and the place was full.  Definitely a place you would take the family.  There are many old pictures hanging on the wall.  Looks like it has a lot of history.

I tried the following dishes:  buffalo wings, fried mushrooms, and the philly cheese steak.

The buffalo wings are good but I really never ate bad buffalo wings.  The fried mushrooms looked like it was covered in breadcrumbs then fried.  It was not special at all.  You just bite through the crunch crust then into the soggy, mussy mushroom.  There were no special flavor or taste to it.  It was served with marinara sauce.  

The Philly cheese steak came with a side of ruffle potato chips.  If you have ever tried Uncle Sam's Subs, you'll be extremely disappointed in the Philly cheese steak here.  The cheese steak wasn't flavorful or memorable.  It was a bit simple.  There wasn't any taste that made me want to make another bite.  It was simple and ok.  But if you were spoiled by Uncle Sam's, there is no comparison.

Conclusion:
Would I come back to this place?  Yes.  I want to give the pizza a try.  My companion recommended me to get it and the reviews on here says so too.  Would I order the buffalo wings again? Yes.  Fried Mushroom?  No.  Philly cheese steak?  No.  The only other deciding factor is it being in Monroeville and I have to deal with Monroeville traffic to get there.  

Overall, it deserves a try.  Looks like a good place to go with some buddies to chit chat and/or watch a game."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, just had it for lunch today. The crust is thick and all smoky on the bottom coming from the wood fired ovens. The toppings are impressive, I got  the pepperoni, and it was thick meaty pieces of browned pepperoni both on top of and below the cheese. All in all, a very good pizza."}
{"text":"I've lived in Pittsburgh for over 20 years and worked in Monroeville for 2 years a few years back and never heard of this place.  My friends decided to meet here for brunch.  I really wasn't missing anything all those years.  This food would have been decent enough 20 years ago, but it is not good by modern standards.  I got an omelette with ham, cheese, onions and green peppers.  It was Eat N' Park quality and fairly small.  The home fries were bland and the toast tasted like cardboard.  That is when I got the right toast.  The waitress was completely overwhelmed and got my order wrong.  She got the type of potatoes wrong and the toast wrong.  Luckily, I just switched the toast with my friend who likes rye and I just ate the wrong potatoes.  Why waste them?  She did do a pretty good job of keeping my drink filled.  Overall it wasn't a great experience.The prices were not exactly cheap either.  I may come back to try the regular lunch food, but I'm not sure why I would when there are so many other great places out there to eat."}
{"text":"Food is hit and miss.  Staff appears to we overworked.  The decor has a lot to be desired.  Extremely noisy.  No place to stand or sit to wait a table. Prices are high.  Ribs are supposed to be their specialty and I was disappointed.  Management has a take it or leave it attitude.
I feel sorry for the staff as they take the brunt of the complaints but they try to make the customer happy wish the other employees did.   I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Arrived at the Gateway Grill at 9:30. Served half of our group. We finally received out food at 10:44, with incorrect orders. 
The food is average and waitstaff is attentive to your drinks but not much else."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, food and drinks. A really crowded place on a Saturday night but worth it. Only reason not 5 stars is because the parking was terrible and we asked to put motocross on one of the 5 TVs that we saw no one was watching and the waitress basically told us no. Other than that, we will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I wish there was an option to give no stars. The company I work for orders from this place every week. When I asked them if my manager could give them a card number over the phone they said only if it was a business card. I asked to talk to the manager since we order EVERY week and they say \"I can try to find him but we are in a rush.\" 
Frankly I don't care if you are in a rush, as a WEEKLY customer I expected more consideration. When the manager came he said I could give him the card number. So the other employee was not only rude but LIED. The manager was also unapologetic and barely accommodating. 
I would not recommend this place to anyone. Their customer service is horrible. You can definitely find better food else where. 
I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food okay.  Great beer selection but the bar staff is a mess.  Too into their own drama.  A more experienced staff would do some good!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for classic wings this is the place to go. I have had the mild, medium, and garlic parm; all of which are delicious. The wings are the perfect size and taste amazing to be so simple."}
{"text":"The pizza here is underrated.  This is a true pizza eater's pizza:  thick, packed with thick toppings and filling.  You could argue there are only 1-2 other places in the city that have better pizza - it's that good.  Beer selection is top notch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in this area. In the top 5 of best Pizza places around here!

Pros:
Great Wings (half)
Great Wing Sauce
Pizza
Wood-Fired oven
Sandwiches
Bottled Beer Selection
On-Tap Beer Selection
Breakfast!
Take-out

Cons:
Limited Seating - gets very busy and could use more seats
Waiting area is very small
Bar seating is also limited.

That being said, this is the go-to place for drinks and great food within 15 miles!"}
{"text":"I never knew this place was open for breakfast until today and their breakfast is amazing! I very much enjoyed their French Toast Stick with its whipped cream and candied apples...Mmmm. So delicious! & Barbara is a wonderful waitress!"}
{"text":"A very busy place. Parking lot is mostly full but it worth to go through all that trouble because the food here is excellent and the variety of drinks!"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing. Their grilled chicken salads are my favorite! Only down side is the parking... but what can you expect when everyone loves the place!"}
{"text":"Food is great but wait staff not so. Had a waitress that was extremely lazy, bad attitude and did not even introduce herself. Rushed us through ordering.... even had a Tiff with the chef, foul language right by our table with kids seated there. ( we were seated right by the kitchen). Talked to manager and he could care less, no offering of compensation or anything. We didn't want anything for free but the offer didn't even come up. Love the food but the management and wait staff suck. No tip for her today ugh. Hopefully if we ever go back she is not there"}
{"text":"The Gateway Grill reminds me of a rundown diner with booze.  Not necessarily a bad thing.  I guess comparing them to a diner isn't entirely fair, since they are independent and offer a decent amount of choices beyond diner style food such as pizza, steaks, and seafood.  

We stopped here for a quick bite a few Saturdays back.  It was a work weekend, meaning we were heading home to work on projects around the house.  That being said, it seemed like a good idea to go ahead and grab a quick late breakfast/lunch while we were out running errands for our projects.

The menu, for the most part, is greasy spoon style food.  Comfort food.  I was looking at the lunch options but nothing was interesting me enough so I opted for their breakfast menu which they serve until 2 pm on the weekends.  

I decided on eggs your way \"Two It\".  It came with two eggs, I chose poached, toast (dry wheat), bacon or sausage (bacon of course) and home fries or hash browns (the home fries were cooked on the grill so easy decision).  In the meantime I requested an Irish coffee, hold the whip.  

Our food came out in a reasonable time.  While waiting I looked around and noticed how dated and dingy the place looked.  I guess they have done some updating over the years but it still looks pretty dumpy.  It's weird since their sister location, Bella Luna, received a complete makeover years ago.  You would think they might want to try the same here.

Food was ok.  Very comparable to any diner.  My poached eggs were served in a glass bowl.  They were overcooked but not enough for me to request a remake.  The bacon was crisp and the home fries were ok.  They lacked seasoning, AKA salt.  All in all ok meal.  I was pleased with my coffee so not a bad stop, just not very memorable for me.  If you grew up in the area this place may have a much bigger meaning to you.  I didn't so it doesn't."}
{"text":"Great food at Gateway Grill!!! I have to admit the first time I went here several years ago I ordered a salad and thought...\"eh, average food\" Don't get me wrong, the salad was decent...but really people, its a salad. So I never bothered to go out of my way to try this place again.

Now....fast forward a few years and a group of us decided to stop in for a quick bite and I ordered the wood fire grilled Western Burger. OMG! Delious! I craved this burger for 2 weeks until I begged the hubby for us to go back just so I could get it again! During that visit, my son had the Spicy burger and loved it as well. Our other son had the ribs and said they were best he has had in a long long time. I would have to agree and on our 4th visit I ordered my own and they are among the best. Fall off the bone yummy!

On our 5th visit, between the group of us we tried the steak (which was good, not great, but still tasty) the ribs again, the burger again, both excellent as always. A new item tried this visit was the fish club: a tasty piece of lightly battered cod with 3 large battered shrimp covered in melted cheese garnished with the standards on a soft hoagie bun - MY NEW FAVORITE FISH SAMMY!!! I know where my \"go to\" place will be during Lent this year!!!

On our 6th visit, our group stuck with the ribs, burgers and tried the wedding soup with good reviews and the steak hoagie which was stated as being very good; not the best he has had, but tasty none the less.

On our 7th visit, the burger, fish, ribs and wings was the groups decision. All well received as usual.

Are you seeing a pattern people?! lol....

While dining in, we noticed many many pizzas being served and they all looked amazing as they were delivered right from the wood fired ovens to the table. As also did the strombolis and calzones, which are next on our list to try.

As many others mentioned, there is a wide range of beer selections to choose from and coolers on the upper level for you to explore the assortment. The place is always busy, obviously for a reason. So get up and go try some great food at this local neighborhood favorite and you won't be disappointed.

I write this review as the hubby is on his way to retrieve a take out order to stop my crazy cravings of this wonderful food of which I write about. Go try it for yourself and be the judge. My verdict is in :)"}
{"text":"2 1/2 starts, if only half stars were permitted....Great atmosphere, cheap drinks, and good pizza, but the appetizers are way overpriced. Service was ok, but we had about 4 different servers. Bathrooms were not good. Two stalls and no paper towels, clogged toilets and no hand dryers. A waitress slipped and fell right outside the bathrooms because the floor was wet from ice bucket residue. Over 30 beers to pick from, which was nice, but I can't get over the $7.50 appetizers for 16 little cheese balls. Definitely come here for drinks and pleasant service, but don't waste your money on the apps."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little girl and it's still just as good :) by far the best pizza in monroeville if you're looking to dine while in the area; especially their Pittsburgh style pizza (thicker crust). Their wings are awesome too, I usually get the honey mustard wings, I love their honey mustard sauce so much!! But I've pretty much had every flavor since I've gone here growing up and they're all fantastic. And I can't forget to include the variety of beers they have available to buy packs of in the back seating area! I just love everything about this place"}
{"text":"The food here is ok. The service not so much. Even after expressly stating what I wanted, my order was still wrong. And, why do I have to ask for syrup for my pancakes??? They work on tips. Enjoy your $2.25 ."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Burgh!  Service is great!  Gateway Grill has the best food and is always our family's first choice for casual dining."}
{"text":"All the reviews I saw were for pizza, so I was skeptical of going for breakfast, but decided to give it a try. It was a good gamble. The food was great. I had a breakfast burrito that was excellent. One of my kids got a 1/2 cinnamon roll with sausage and potatoes. The cinnamon roll must have been huge because even 1/2 was more than my 6 year old could eat. I tried it and it tasted great too. I knocked one star off because for 3 adults and 1 kid, we spent $50 plus tip which is a bit more than I expected."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in the east of the city.  Also best brunch in Monroeville.  Wood fire oven makes a huge difference in taste.  Friendly staff and bartenders.  Plenty of tvs to watch sporting events on tv."}
{"text":"This place is a surprise! From the outside it looks like a small diner,  with a tight parking lot. However, when you get inside it is a Sports Bar with loads of seating and a HUGE menu! I have neen here several times and it is ALWAYS consistant! Not a long wait for seating but ALWAYS packed! ALWAYS perfectly prepared food and GREAT service! The Philly Cheesesteak is AWESOME! Fresh cut fries! The menu is ENORMOUS and I always have trouble deciding!  We will return!"}
{"text":"We have always loved Gateway and if you want some good, albeit greasy, pizza and great wings, this is the place to go. But here is where the 1 star comes in, they have over 30 beers on tap, so like pretty much any \"beer\" place they USED to offer to fill growlers. Tonight we went in here and just wanted to get a growler, which is just about the easiest thing to do, and it took 5 minutes to even get the attention of the bartender, who then decided to tell us that she didn't know if they served growlers. In comes the pompous \"beer manager\" who very curtly says they only fill their own growlers, not the stainless steel one we brought. When we inquired about said growlers, he  informed us that they didn't sell them anymore.......wow.........so what you're saying is you don't offer growlers AND you wasted so much of our time only to treat us like garbage. So we won't be returning to Gateway to purchase their overpriced beer again. And don't bother looking on their website to try to find any info about their takeaway beer policy....because it's not there."}
{"text":"I have to say I was very impressed by the pizza here. I am extremely picky when it comes to pizza. The crust was airy and fluffy yet a nice crunch on the bottom due to the wood fire cooking method. We had a large for 5 people. Big mistake. The large is like an extra large. Massive pizza with huge cuts. We had just pepperoni and extra cheese. Great choice. The pepperoni was thick sliced and had a zest to it. The cheese was unbelievable mozzarella. We had plenty left over to take home for dinner. Our appetizer was cheesy garlic bread. It was a small crust pizza loaded with cheese and garlic. Simply  amazing. With only two ice teas and all that food it was an economical $34.53 before tip. We will be back and I suggest you try this place as well."}
{"text":"The food is good to average, setting is tight to many tables and not enough servers, went for brunch today 6 of us how long does it take a waffle? At this place it takes one hour !
The manager comes over to take 1 waffle off the bill  
Really! 
I will never be back , to slow and the food was not worth waiting for"}
{"text":"It was okay. I wouldn't recommend the Philly Cheesesteak. It tasted off and the meat was not the best. It also took about 15 minutes for anyone to come to our table.  I might go there to watch a game. Maybe the bar type food is better."}
{"text":"I wrote a fiver when I was abroad and feeling nostalgic.  After eating at GG several times in the past year I see that this place as sunk into the monroeville mire.  

I used to love their pies...but I've become more educated on what makes a really great east coast pizza and this isn't it.  Often the crust is soggy on the bottom and doesn't support toppings and cheese.

What really ticks me off about this place is that they have this extensive beer list but don't have the decency to add pricing.  More than once I've asked a waitress about pricing and get bewildered looks.  And more than once I've said \"fuck it...how much could it be\" and realized I could have had 4 slices of Ferrari's for the price of this goddamned overrated pint of piss."}
{"text":"Gateway Grill is one of those places that you hear people talk about but really never get a chance to stop at.  That is until one day when you meet up with friends for lunch and you end up here.  Walking in to this place during lunch time is like walking into a wall of noise.  Now don't get me wrong, it's a good sign to walk into.  That means this place has been and will be busy, that it is well liked, and it's a local favorite.

Inside is set up a little wonky, but it works for the space.  The main room is rather large and open.  On the one side of this room is the bar area to which I cannot speak of as I did not go up there.  On the other side of this room there is the kitchen.  Unlike most establishments where the kitchen is hidden, you have full view of how the food is constructed.  With that, it's kind of amusing to watch because patrons end up almost walking into the kitchen by mistake.

We were seated in a raised booth right off the kitchen and that turned out to be great service for us.  Our server was top notch with her knowledge of the food and menu.  She was able to give suggestions to my friends as I already saw what I wanted to devour.  

I opted for the Pittsburger.  Now I want to straighten something out from the description on the menu.  They state that this eight ounce burger that comes off the wood fire grill and is topped with provolone cheese, fresh cut French fries and a homemade vinaigrette slaw placed on fresh Italian bread.  Everything about that is true except the bread.  What I got wasn't fresh Italian bread, what I got resembled more along the lines of New York Texas style toast.  I feel that because of this bread choice, that's what made the sandwich turn out a bit soggier than I expected.  Believe you me, it still tasted great, but a bit wet.  Of course you know I got fresh cut fries as my side.  I love fresh fries.  I don't care how you season them, but something better about a potato cut up and fried.  Tastes so much better then the prepackaged frozen stuff."}
{"text":"This place is always busy for a good reason. They serve great ribs, pizza, wings and a good selection of tasty meals and sandwiches and hoagies. The wood fired grill definitely adds to the great flavor of the grilled food.

The beer selection is outstanding and if you wanted you could get a martini too.
They have really good service and the staff does care if you are being served. There is a bar and there are TVs everywhere.

I try to eat here or get a takeout several times a month. My last visit was 1/10/12 and had Pizza, Wings and a great draft. 
Oh yeah, I should add that they have a breakfast menu and the food, eggs etc.  is very good homemade non-chain.

It's not a secret in Monroeville, but the surrounding areas should be advised to check it out.
Nothing extra fancy, not expensive, just good food and worth repeat visits."}
{"text":"This place is a Monroeville staple. Plenty of seating, an extensive menu, and ample beers on tap. If you get a chance to dine here for breakfast, do so. Its really good. Overall its a great place with decent service.  At one point their service was horrible but that was years ago. They've improved in that area. 

My only complaint is that its in a plaza and there's  not a lot of parking.  Otherwise its smoke free and that's a plus. Hit it up for a good night."}
{"text":"Impressed with anything I've ever gotten here! The ribs are to die for.. Fall off the bone tender with addictive sauce."}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast!

We have been to Gateway Grill a few times before for dinner. Sports bar atmosphere, with tv's on every wall and corner. 

The service was great, waited no longer than 6-7 Mins for a great hot breakfast. 

Definitely in the restaurant rotation list!"}
{"text":"The service is very good, I eat there for lunch on Fridays.  We have about 6 to 10 friends on Fridays.  We eat from the menu, and find it very good.  
Try the crab cakes during lent!
They have great fries.
The iced tea is also very good."}
{"text":"You have to realize what you are coming here for.  This is a bar with a GIANT beer selection.  They have a woodgrill and serve awesome bar food.  The pizza and burgers are really good.  The ribs melt in my mouth.  My husband loves the reuben and the calzone.  We come here pretty often and its always busy.  The service is usually friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped for an early morning breakfast.  The special was a bargain at $3.99!!!  Great service, and even better food!   This restaurant will become a regular stop now when traveling in the area!!"}
{"text":"On a Steeler game day you can usually find me at one of two  establishments in The 'Ville. This is one of them. Super service from the bar, tons of TV's to catch the action on and a great selection of \"bar food\" and sandwiches. The pizza, wings and ribs are very good. The beer selection is even better. Tons of stuff on draft and an expansive bottle shop as well. The prices are reasonable, though it is possible to mix yourself a $30.00 six pack if you aren't paying attention. Having some friends that are Grill regulars I've gotten to know some of the staff and they are always attentive and pleasant, even when the bar area is packed to the gills on a Steeler Game Day. It's one of my favorite places to spend a few hours with my friends. OH! I almost forgot, they have breakfast now and it's pretty darn good! I had the blueberry pancakes and they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Unexpected great food!!! Huge beer list. Great history. Nice TVs all around. Perfect service with Erin."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick beer. Felt very comfortable.  Friendly staff and excellent selection of beer. We didn't eat, but walking past people to go to the restroom,  the food looked and smelled amazing. 
Clean bathrooms too!"}
{"text":"The beer selection here is pretty great - there are 30 beers on tap. It was 80 degrees outside and probably the same inside - I was sweating the whole time. It took an hour for the bartender to switch the tv to the game - I politely requested it 3 times. The worst part was the food - easily the worst ribs I've ever had. Sad thing was that they said it was one of the best things on their menu. I'd probably give it a second chance,  but I'd definitely stay away from the ribs."}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza - solid 
Fried Zucchini - solid
Cheese steak hoagie - solid
Waitress - super accommodating 
and attentive.   
This place is worth a visit.  Not cheap but Ill be a repeat for sure."}
{"text":"We were in monroeville after turning off of the turnpike. After visiting the mall we stopped here. There was a little wait, but nothing major. We were seated at a high top in the bar area. It would've been kind to ask if that was OK. I would've taken any other table except a high top with no backs on chairs :/

They had a special on prime rib (10oz) and 2 sides for $15. We each ordered one with baked potato. My bf also got coleslaw which was great and very creamy. I ordered a side salad which was filled with lettuce, onion, green pepper, tomato, cucumber, mushroom, olives.. Now that's a good side salad. Our steaks were good. Service was also OK. 

Next time I'll be sure to try out other menu items. Everyone's food looked great! Huge wings, fresh cut fries, piled high sandwiches, huge pizzas & good beer selection. I look forward to heading back"}
{"text":"We came in thinking this would be a wonderful local join for a breakfast. We made the huge mistake of telling our server what we wanted and she put it all together as ala cart. This boosted her ticket price exponentially, at the expense of our overall experience. At $4.00 for a biscuit and gravy we had two. that's $8.00 for two biscuits that where so salty and dry it was yuck. The rest of the meal was on par with the likes of Denny's however I was expecting so much more. Hoping that if you venture into this place you avoid the pit fall we found."}
{"text":"I am a pizza connoisseur. Anyone who's looking for good pizza in the area, I always ask \"Do you prefer thick or thin crust?\" If they say \"thick\", one of the few places I recommend is Gateway Grill. 

Their Pittsburgh style pizza is WONDERFUL. I'm a pretty greedy person I can easily kill a large Pizza Hut/Domino's pizza but 2 GG slices usually does me in. Cheesy,gooey, pepperoni-y, loveliness. 

I have tried their breakfast and it's tasty, but honestly I really go to GG for the pizza. Sometimes they have leftover cinnamon rolls from the breakfast shift and I snag one of those and oh yeah. That's my kind of dinner. :)"}
{"text":"I recently had a late breakfast with friends here. Good breakfast. Nothing fancy . . . and I think that's just fine. Plenty of food. Prices OK. Very good service. I'd go back if in the area. Place could stand a remodel maybe?"}
{"text":"Great for happy hours with deals on drinks and appetizers. Typical bar food, was a little disappointed in my grilled chicken sandwich (it comes on bread not a bun) that's my only dislike about it, but next time I know so I could get a bun. They were busy and out waitress still was very good I can't remember her name it was on 2/22/18 she was very sweet and attentive. The nacho grande is very good and probably one of my favorites. If you're looking for a good happy hour to meet old friends or go after work I would recommend. They also carry twisted teas which is hard to find to find."}
{"text":"The sausage breakfast sandwich was absolutely delicious. The hash browns, though standard, were still very good. The restaurant was more of a sports type place, but with more of a family approach. The service was great; friendly people who know when to stop by and when to keep their distance. The food came quickly. If you're ever in Monroeville, stop into the place. The prices are a great deal for the great food!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and great beer prices at that.    Service was good and bartenders friendly.

I had the ribs and they were possibly some of the best I've had.  Truly fall off the bone.  You don't even need teeth they're so tender."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place looking for a good bar with good food. We've been twice. The first time was for a quick lunch. Sandwiches and fries. They were delicious! The second was for a very casual dinner with our boys. The burgers are amazing. The wings, ribs, and pizza is amazing. The service was spectacular. Bailey is super sweet. 

The place has tons of tv's to watch whatever game you're in the mood for and so much beer. I was impressed with the beer list.

I'm anxiously awaiting wing night!"}
{"text":"I got a gift for this place and never have been here. Let me tell you I can not do
Plain about anything I got. We ordered the rib appetizer platter w ribs, wings, provolone cheese sticks, and potato skins. The ribs were cooked to perfection and the sauce was out of this world. Hands down some of the best ribs I've ever had. The wings I got mild buffalo which were very tasty! For lunch we each got a burger. I got The stacker with included onion rings, ham, bacon, and cheddar cheese. It was NO skimpy burger by any means I got it made medium rare which it was cooked perfectly. I could only eat half but it was delicious. It comes with fries as well which were cooked differently but they were light and crunchy outside and soft pillowy center. My partner in crime for this meal got the blue cheese burger with bacon and it was cooked medium and she stated it was one of the best burgers she's had too! The server was friendly and the prices were great for the amount of food you get. I have enough left over for dinner :) can't wait to go back and try other things off their menu"}
{"text":"This was my second trip here and I can now say with confidence that I like it!

PROS:  
One of the biggest Beer selections that I've ever seen under one roof!  And not just domestic crap, but imports, micro-brews, etc.  They had Magic Hat on Draft!  :)
Great Food;
Reasonably Priced;
Casual atmosphere;
Fast, Friendly Service;
a TON of TV's and VERY sports friendly!

CONS:
I wish the menu were more creative.
Lots of burgers and sandwiches, wings and typical bar foods and appetizers.


Suggestions:
My husband ordered the Pittsburgher (a big burger) and said it was really good.
I ordered the Swordfish (that was on for the Lenten Special) and it was also pretty good!
I hear that the Pizza is amazing (and it def looked like it was!!!)
We'll try Pizza and/or Ribs next time, those two things looked/smelled incredible!"}
{"text":"This is my worst experience. Because I'm dark skin you would treatment like that. Fuck noooooo! The staff was very rude to my boyfriend and I. My waitress interpreted us and she left us without letting us finish talking."}
{"text":"Never actually made it in. I called ahead to see if they take reservations and the woman on the phone was so rude I'll never step foot in this place."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best pizza in Pittsburgh. I will go out of my way to get pizza from this place. The chicken wings are probably one of the better ones on the east side of Pittsburgh. The ribs are really good for not being done in the smoker. Great beer selection especially by the bottle. Love watching sports here. The burgers are pretty decent. I like the fact that you can substitute bison for an up charge. I've never been disappointed at this place. Have been coming here for years."}
{"text":"We tried Gateway Grill for the first time after hearing a time or two that it was one of the best local places in Monroeville.  We were seated right away in the bar area and the energy and atmosphere is really great, as long as you're looking for that loud, fast paced kind of place.  The menu is big, and the beer list is bigger (woohoo!), so there are options for everyone!  Our service was decent as was our food, and after we ate we spent about an addition hour or hour and a half just sitting at our table talking, and we never felt rushed or like we were inconveniencing anyone by staying, which was really nice seeing as we were enjoying ourselves and weren't quite ready to call it a night.  I originally wanted to try one of their Philly Cheesesteaks (they have 4 different varieties), but ended up changing my order last minute because of a food allergy I have and they unfortunately couldn't guarantee that they could prevent cross contamination (bummer, but greatly appreciated the honesty), so I ended up ordering an Italian Sub as a last minute decision.  My sub was pretty good.. maybe it's because it's not what I really wanted, but I didn't totally love it, however I will say that it was HUGE, and I was able to have the 2nd half of it for lunch the next day.  

We'll definitely be back to Gateway Grill in the near future, and I'll be sure to try something that I actually want this time, haha!  In all seriousness though, we enjoyed ourselves and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good time at a friendly place!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is far superior to any other dining establishment in Monroeville.  My father was ill at a local hospital and all I wanted was a place to pass a few hours to eat and have a drink to take my mind off the waiting.  The servers were outstanding as well as the food.  I highly, highly recommend this establishment of you are an out of town guest and are looking for a good/ casual experience.   Good management and ownership of all aspects of operations."}
{"text":"Everything is always delicious at gateway Grill never go wrong with them affordable and fast service nice ppl and family atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings!! Fun atmosphere!! Been going there for years and would recommend it if in the mood for pizza, wings, burgers, etc.... breakfast is fantastic to!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and football.  Had the prime rib and ribs and ribs fell off the bone.  Good service as well."}
{"text":"Dropped in while here while on business.  Philly cheesesteak with tomatoe and lettuce and Italian dressing, no peppers. Sucked. Local beer recommended by bartender was foul tasting, and I drink a lot of local craft beers...atmosphere was busy and unattentive, and that was on a Tuesday at 6...over all, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Gateway Grill is my favorite place to eat in drink in Monroeville, and one of the best pizzas in the whole Pittsburgh area. Huge, reasonably priced, and cooked in a wood-fired oven, the large plain pizza is my standard order. Sometimes we order it extra saucy, as it is sauced on the lighter side. The sauce and cheese are delicious, but the crust is the real star. Perfect thickness, texture, and flavor from the wood oven. This is a pizza that doesn't need a single topping (though the olives are a solid choice). 
The wings are also superb. Crispy, meaty, and their hot sauce is perfectly balanced. Wings are on special weekly and at the late night happy hour, along with the other apps. The restaurant's website is good about keeping up-to-date with listing all specials, plus it offer coupons!
Plus, their beer selection is huge, interesting, and very well priced. They offer mix and match 6 packs to go, with hundreds of fresh bottles to choose from, most in the $2.50 range. Solid draft list also, plus daily specials on domestic drafts, if you don't mind skipping the craft stuff for the evening. 
Really though, the best thing of all is the service. We've never had an unpleasant experience, and have been visiting for years. The servers all pitch in to help each other, and will make sure you have everything you need even if you are not in their section. 
Really love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"My family always goes for the pizza and seasoned wings absolutely delicious!!! We love it!! And the service is alway great and quick!!"}
{"text":"Snowing in the Burgh... At the Golden Grille... good food"}
{"text":"I was really hoping for more outta this place. Maybe because of the numerous people that called this food \"amazing\" and \"delish\". Am I a food snob??? Well, yeah I guess I am (not hatin', just sayin')!

They get two thumbs up for service and promptness of drinks being served though. My adult bevie came out before they even wiped my table or gave me a menu. Usually awesome, but after working a 10.5 hour mid-shift my tummy was a-rumblin'. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad, sans fries and extra cheese. I soon found out that \"extra cheese\" means hold the veggies all together. I really wanted a crunchy cucumber and luscious tomato to bite into, and, sadly, received neither. The chicken pieces were kinda small, but I am a huge fan of how Pittsburgh does wings (Franks Red Hot!), so I was very pleased with the level of spice. Very tasty!

So, my conclusion is that GG is a great bar that just happens to also serve food. If I have gone into my experience with this mindset I may have had a different review to write. I will probably return though, but just for happy hour specials."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for well over ten years. The food is solid. Their pizza is one of my favorites, a thicker crust, non sweet sauce and lots of cheese. I usually get there buffalo chicken salad with grilled chicken and ranch. And they don't used that gross bottled ranch either! Lots of veggies and a good potion of chicken. The parking lot looks busy but usually the wait isn't too long."}
{"text":"Good food.. waitress was really nice.. however it took over an hour to get our breakfast!  People next to us came in nearly 30 minutes after us and got their food at the same time.  Our food didn't even come out together.  I think the waitress just thought she needed to start sending it out in pieces because it was taking so long.  My husband's meal came out last and he ordered french toast, which was probably the simplest item.  I originally grew up in this area so have been here years ago, and i don't remember having such a bad experience.  But, my mother said she has heard of the same grumblings from other people as well."}
{"text":"Our first experience with Gateway Grill was okay. We got takeout pizza and wings both of which tasted good. The large pizza is definitely LARGE and I consider it moderate on the greasy scale. The wings were also large. 

Disappointing was the fact they charge $1.75 for each small cup of ranch or blue cheese. It seems unnecessary to be nickel and dimed after purchasing 24 wings and a large pizza but some places like to do this. 

It seemed very busy inside even on a Sunday night. I would return to give them another shot."}
{"text":"With their fantastic pizza and large take out beer area gateway grille is a great choice for lunch, dinner, or somewhere to watch the game. Their prices are fair and the selection of bottled beer is second to none."}
{"text":"Always pass by this place and it's always busy according to the fullness of the parking lot.  So busy that it put me off, but, finally, dined here last night. 

Pros:  
Found a parking spot even though it was quite packed.
Quick service and empty tables even though the parking lot was busy.

Cons:
Grilled chicken salad with fries atop not all that special.  Ranch dressing pretty bland.
Extensive beer menu only does one good if they actually remember to bring the beer.  For whatever reason, beer not brought and not charged.  

Too many options exist to want to revisit."}
{"text":"Two thumbs down for the breakfast my boyfriend and I received. His pancakes didn't look done and didn't taste very good at all. The breakfast potatoes were hard. We were looking forward to some good potatoes but this wasn't the place to get them, unfortunately we left them on the plate. The best part had to be the veggie omelet and wheat toast that I got. Obviously, we won't be going back.."}
{"text":"I had the bacon burger w/ fries. It was big with good taste and fresh fixings. The pizza was good for a grill. Nothing special. Waitress was bad. More worried about bullshiting then doing her job and I'm easygoing. Parking also sucked. I will go back because the food was good but not too soon."}
{"text":"We stopped by here on a whim recently. Three adults and one child, about dinner time on a Sunday. We were seated promptly, wait staff was awesome and very friendly. They brought our food out very fast and were really just all around good people. 

The pizza we got was HUGE and it was delicious. Very yummy and we were treated so well- there will definitely be a return trip!"}
{"text":"Great food great price great place. One manager is miserable but I only had to talk to him once or twice. Don't ask him to change the tvs."}
{"text":"I love Gateway Grill. Never got food here I didn't like. Wings, pizza, burgers are great. I usually order the Pittsburgh salad with chicken instead of steak. Drink specials aren't great, but their wing specials are good. It gets pretty packed on Friday and Saturday nights but I've never had to wait longer than 20 minutes. Service is usually good, some servers could be more pleasant. Crowd can get kind of rough on the bar side during Pittsburgh sports games but nothing the bartenders can't handle."}
{"text":"It is hard to write a review when the only thing you order is a salad, but I gotta admit it was delicious and the chef met all of my annoying, stupid fixes and specifications I asked for.  

Chicken salad with \"medley\" of veggies added, no cucumber, no cheese, fries on the side, dressing on the side.  Yeah I know I am sure he thought I was some freak, but what can I say, when it comes to salad, I am a pain in the ass.  It was delicious.

It did take a pretty long while for the food to come out.  My friends and I were sort of getting impatient, but whatever, we got over it.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals too, and we are already planning out our next visit to try their pizza and wings."}
{"text":"$1.75 for a cup of ranch with the 2 dozen wings and large pizza??????? No way.  It is $7 a gallon at a wholesaler! I have been a loyal customer for years! I love the food, but treating your customers like that over ranch dressing is down right ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Gateway Grill has some pretty fabulous pizza.  Very consistent, very greasy and oh-so-good.  All of their food is consistently prepared and well flavored.

Staff is on the ball - but there is no choice.  Staff gotta be grade A or would be run over - it's that busy, all the time.  

Almost gave it 3-stars, until I reminded myself 1) GREAT FOOD 2) GREAT SERVICE.  How many TV's, I could not count.  That is not a plus for me.  Just too noisy as I generally actually like my dinner companions and want to converse.  There is nothing calm about an evening here, it's a loud successful bar/restaurant that is very, very alive and very, very LOUD.

We are GG takeout patrons, mostly.  Occasionally we are tempted inside because the food is that good.  

Parking is adequate, but not abundant."}
{"text":"I love this place!! They have everything I want and like there. Pizza, Calzones, wings, sandwiches and BEEEEER! On this particular night I decided to order a BBQ chicken salad. It wasn't on the menu but I turned a buffalo into a BBQ. It was really good, fresh lettuce and cheese, hot chicken.

They had beer special going on. We bought the 21st amendment IPA and got to take home the glass they served it in. The beer itself was pretty good along with the other selections on draft and the two walls of beers.

The husband order some ribs and man where they good. They had that perfect smokey flavor and the sauce was just as good. I always prefer sweet baby ray's but I believe they have a homemade sauce. They are usually busy sometimes with a 20 minute wait. They have one of the best calzones I've ever had, seriously good!"}
{"text":"We waited 15 minutes for our server to take just our drink order. We were right about to walk out. We were there around lunch time...it wasn't packed or anything and our waitress was on her cell phone. From where we sat I could see into the kitchen where they cook and after that I didn't even want to eat. The kitchen doesn't look clean at all. I've stopped in the bottle shop before and there's a good selection of craft beers where you can mix and match. But I can tell you, I won't be ordering any food from there again!"}
{"text":"We came to the Gateway Grille for breakfast before the Steelers/Broncos game on 12/20. We were seated quickly, even though they were pretty busy. Our waitress, Anna, was really fantastic. She offered suggestions, brought us things before we thought to ask for them and was very pleasant. 
My husband had the country fried steak, which comes with TWO pieces of steak, covered in sausage gravy. It was a lot of food. I had an omelet. It was cooked well, full of meat and cheese. 
We looked at the lunch/dinner menu while we were there and it's definitely a place we'd return to next time we're in town. They also have a great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Great service for a busy Mother's Day. Had a table of 8 adults. All food came out in a timely matter. My medium rare steak salad was great! Everyone else's meals were good as well. Great place to eat. Anything on the wood fired grill tastes great."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast for the third time over the last two weeks. The first two times, we were so impressed that we told everyone that it was the best in town. Today?  Not so much. Waited 10 minutes while waitstaff ran around looking busy but not getting anything done. The order came out with incorrect bread and burnt sausage patties. The patties had been obviously pre-cooked and left sitting on the grill--so overdone, black and dry that I used a knife to cut but they were inedible. The home fries were cold. It was apparent there is no quality control and the staff just doesn't care.  A server, not ours, graciously refilled our coffee cups. This is not a place that we will return and we will not recommend anyone else to go there again either."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh without a doubt. Never had a bad experience at Gateway Grill."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a football game - lots of TVs!!   Large beer selection, great pizza and wings, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My wife and I weren't planning on stopping her for brunch on Saturday but after kickboxing in the morning and an hour at Big Lots we needed to eat!  

     Growing up in Monroeville and going to Gateway high school it was always cool to come to this place when I was younger.  My dad went to Gateway back in the 70's and his team won the Wpial so they have his photo here which is always cool to see.  I couldn't find it this time around but I know they have it somewhere.

     When I would visit here in my younger days I would always get a pizza or a calzone.  I think they have he best calzones here.  If I didn't eat pizza the night before I would have ordered one today.

     We walked in around 12pm on a Saturday and it was busy.  The bar is full but we managed to find a booth.  They have a breakfast menu until 2pm on Saturdays and they have their regular menu still.  I wanted breakfast but we had a big day ahead of us so I needed to eat something more than breakfast. My wife did order breakfast for herself but I went with their Diablo burger and fries.  

     My wife did enjoy her breakfast and she got a good Irish Coffee so breakfast here isn't bad at all.  

     I thought my burger was ok.  I wanted it medium and it was more medium well.  It was spicy the way I wanted it because it had peppers, jalapenos, and pepper jack cheese on it but the ingredients just weren't as fresh as I like them.  They tasted like they were just from a jar.  The fries were plain too.  They tasted better once I put some S and P on them but I was expecting the fries to be better seasoned.  

     It was nice to come back here but I'm not sure if we will be back anytime soon.  It seems like the bar is always busy and I probably would only come back for their pizza/calzone or just breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Been here before - but my first yelp review.  The Beer selections are quite good, no compaints, and the servers were pleasant (at the bar) otherwise GG gets 1 star.  Tonight I had the \"specal\" NY Strip - probably the worst NY Strip I have ever had, too thin, leathery and chalky - I didn't finish it - the fries were pretty good however.  
Another semingly minor issue - that really bugged me was the Heinz was watered down, probably refilled and watered down- THIS IS PITTSBURGH PEOPLE!  - but also the L&P Worcestershire was watered down - the steak needed help and I wasn't getting any.   Another weird point, the guys next to me wanted some bread - \"oh we do not have bread\" they got a few slices of white bread - but this place offers hoagies!  -- Cut up a damn roll and make the customer happy....  Other than the beer selection - why go?  I don't know."}
{"text":"For dinner, gateway grill is one of the best sports bars around. Their hoagies are great. But for breakfast, my wife and I didn't have as a great a meal. She ordered poached eggs, which by definition are steamed with water. But gateway grill makes them with margarine. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet which was good but not great. It was loaded with ham though, so at least it wasn't small. We will stick with their hoagies and try somewhere else for breakfast."}
{"text":"We had the specials. Land and sea. 10 oz strip with grilled shrimp. The menu said 3 shrimp, I got 5.  Both were prepared perfectly.  The second dish was ribs and prime rib. The menu said half a rack of ribs, it looked like a full rack. The prime rib was a big serving and delish.  We come here a lot, we highly recommend the pizza,  wings, and beer too, enjoy."}
{"text":"Since we've discovered Gateway Grill, it's our top spot in Monroeville. Amazing cheap breakfasts, filling homestyle dinners. The smell outside alone is a good enough review. Yum."}
{"text":"Huge menu.  Wide variety of choices.  The pizza looked awesome but the \"mini\" is a 12\" pizza.  Burger meat quality is not awesome but I don't think it's their specialty.  Locals speak of their pizza.  Just couldn't bring myself to order a mini and waste most of it due to a lack of storage in hotel room."}
