{"text":"Stopped by here for an early dinner on a Saturday around 5pm.  There was a nice amount of people watching TV, chatting and playing pool.  It's a clean divey bar with fantastic service and food.  The shrimp and fish basket was so fresh and tasty and the server confirmed it was swimming in Rocky Point recently.  Can't beat that for seafood in Phoenix!!  My chicken, avocado, bacon sandwich was awesome and the chili wings were meaty (actually quite huge!) and tasted great.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Back when this was Cactus Jack's I went in once and it was super dirty and sketchy. What a difference new ownership makes! The place is sparkling clean, including the restrooms. I am super weird about cleanliness especially when places serve food. The staff has been fabulous every time we've gone in with friendly people working there. The food is also super yummy! The chicken fingers and burgers are to-die-for! I didn't care for the wings but that was a personal preference as their flavoring is good but they aren't as crisp as I prefer them as they aren't grilled. It's a very interesting crowd of all different kinds of people and it has a fun mix of music along with a pool table. This is a great casual place to hang out and grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Greatest bar in N Phoenix ! Bartenders keeps you coming back! Jen (weekdays) is the best! Always cheerful, attentive, hot & sweet !  Food is fresh - massive burgers - fresh fries - tacos ! Great place!"}
{"text":"We went here last night based off he reviews that we read.   The food was delicious and the shrimp and fish are highly recommended.   Drinks are not shy and the Jell-O shots are wow!   Kris our waitress/bartender did a great job."}
{"text":"I love a good dive and this place fits the bill. I didn't try the food but I absolutely love the environment and super cheap drinks."}
{"text":"Great little bar with awesome bar food! They give you lots of food too. Chris, our server was the best. We will be back."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I went to the Cactus Tavern, but if you are looking for a nice \"biker bar\", this is it. The best thing about this place is the service. It was very good even though there was only one bartender on staff while I was there. The second best thing (for me) is they had Stella on tap. Overall a good experience for this type of place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and cocktails at excellent prices.  Have ordered many different items on the menu and have NOT been disappointed with anything. Great bartenders.  Everyone is friendly and this place knows and practices quality customer service.  Same owners own Wrecked at the Reef in Rocky Point.  If you order the shrimp basket here you will be getting wonderful Rocky Point shrimp!  Whatever you order for food, you will be pleasantly surprised.  Good portions. You will go home full. IF you can finish it all."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and stopped in for a quick lunch.  Great atmosphere. Jen was awesome. Highly recommend you going in for a drink or food. We had taco Tuesday, all I cane say is it was awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Place is pretty much a carbon copy of Wrecked at the Reef in Rocky Point, without the amazing beach.  Food was decent, good bar selection and prices, and again the service was highly attentive and friendly. Lots of tv's, good for games."}
{"text":"Noticed the bar years ago and finally stopped in for beer and tacos. Entering the establishment the 1st thing the came to my mine was the TV series \"CHEERS\". The bartender knew almost everyone's name and drink they wanted.
It's too bad that I couldn't order the 3 tacos with different meat, being able to do this would have let me know what I liked and didn't but I was able to order 2 hard and 1 soft taco.
I had to mention to the bartender that I ordered a watermelon jello shots which after I reminded her she gave it to me.
My husband had the combo plate that had shrimp, fish and french fries and it was DELICIOUS!! We were told the fish and shrimp we're fresh from Mexico, BONUS!!!
Can I make a suggestion, freeze the glasses you serve beer in. I had a large Bud Light and it wasn't as cold as I like, so far I only know 1 bar that has ice cold Bud light served in ice cold glasses.
If you want to feel \"at home\" in a bar I would fully recommend Cactus Tavern. The bartender will make you feel like you are a part of their family"}
{"text":"The worst service in the world.  Servers name is Shannon.

Watched others being served that arrived after I did. I was at the bar.

Ordered a 1000 island burger after 29 minutes still no food. Cancelled food order paid for beer and left.  I will never return."}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood joint! Mrs. D. and I love the burgers! Really nice bartenders. Squeaky clean, cool place. I wish they had a jukebox, but the music videos are cool. Will definitely be back again and again.
POOL TABLE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cactus Tavern is LEGIT.  Kris, Jen and Susie are awesome friendly bartenders that take great care of us every time we are in.  Good prices and the best part is they have excellent food.  Wings, shrimp basket, burgers, onion rings are all so good.  Perfect spot to hit happy hour or watch a ball game!"}
{"text":"Great food, cocktails, and atmosphere. The shrimp cocktails and salsa are fantastic. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Fun,  clean place.  Enjoy hanging out. Newly owned and remodeled.  Very nice. Live band here tonight."}
{"text":"Love coming here!!!! It's a fun warm atmosphere where you can have fun play darts pool have drinks and have a good time!!!"}
{"text":"Was hiking in the preserve and decided to stop for a beer.  Nice little bar.  Standard beer selection( nothing fancy), friendly staff, very clean.  Had all the football games going.  Pretty good vibe in here.  If you're looking for a fairly low key and nice neighborhood bar this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Really enjoy what they have done with the place! Great bartenders and good drinks. They also recently opened the kitchen."}
{"text":"There is nothing on the menu that isn't absolutely excellent. The burgers , the amount of French fries, the hot dogs are amazing, the pound of wings , the stuffed quesadilla is great and filling .. Chris and Sue the female bartenders are really fun and great to talk to and mix a terrific Long Island ice tea .. Matt is hip and pretty fun to talk to . The crowd is relaxed , friendly and very neighborly.. one of the highlights of going is that a few of the tv's have actual videos of the music that is playing .. all the favorites that MTV Used to play .. and of course when a game is on .. they have that too .. one pool table that's in great shape .. and just an all around good bar . I go often just to eat and watch the music videos . Check it out . Definitely one of the better bars in the valley . The decor is easy on the eyes and not too dark or too light .."}
{"text":"It was a quiet Monday night but we had excellent burger, wings and chicken sandwich plus onion rings etc. Fun waiter, good service, and plenty of variety on the big screen TV's including sports and a retro MTV-like music channel with classic rock and country."}
{"text":"Stopped by in the late afternoon, looked like a little hole in the wall. It was! LOL Kind of a real dive bar. But don't let the looks from the outside or the total lack of ambience put you off. The food is fantastic! When the waitress said that the fish and shrimp were swimming yesterday and had just been driven up from Mexico this morning I had to try it. Loved the fresh fish and shrimp basket, wonderful burger, huge amount of good quality fries.  Classic rock music. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome bartenders, fantastic drink specials! TVs for the game and good background tunes always on. Just moved to the area and I will definitely be back here often :)"}
{"text":"Good neighborhood dive bar.  Drinks are good and cheap, food is much better than your average bar and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Great bar with yummy food.  We got the fish w onion straws.  Both were so good and not greasy for fried food.  Fish was different than any ever had before.  Lots of good flounder.  Great clean bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Need to stop by when I can stay awhile.

I need a need a friend and have 30 minutes to spare so I thought I'd stop in at Cactus Tavern and I'm so glad I did

Cactus Tavsrn is a nice comfortable place. Great environment. Food is excellent. Beer on point. Great price. Highly recommend. Nice day bar for happy hour. 

I wish I had more time to spend I will have to revisit very soon."}
{"text":"My friend and I don't live in the area and we're looking for a place to grab some food while we waited for an appointment. I looked up places nearby on yelp, and Cactus Tavern was the closest place open. We walked in and it's clearly a dark divey sports bar. The bartender was friendly and inviting and got us drinks right away. I ordered the BLT which comes with a fried egg on it. It was so yummy! My friend got mozzarella bites which also looked awesome. My total bill for my sandwich (which also came with a generous portion of fries I couldn't finish) and a Lagunitas was only $11. Super cheap. There were lots of TVs playing the football game too. Unfortunately I don't live anywhere near here so I probably won't be back, but if I ever am in the area again I would totally return."}
{"text":"Amazing burger!!  Large portion. Be sure to order the onion rings--out of this world. Bar atmosphere. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Me and my party are traveling to the area from South Carolina and we were looking for a unique, local place to watch a sports game and came across the Cactus Tavern.  The guy running the bar and dining room was very attentive and friendly (something we have not seen a lot of out West!)

The place is definitely locals but the environment is quaint and inviting! Also, the food is all around amazing.  We got everything from burgers to tacos and guacamole and everything was fresh and cooked to order for a great price! 

Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to get a taste of what Phoenix locals do for pub food!"}
{"text":"Great TV set up and a place to watch the game with a neighborhood bar vibe. Also great bartending and kudos for having the game playing on the sound system."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before, and it was by pure chance we found it! Awesome atmosphere (GREAT music, music videos, sports on the TV, great people), great service (Matt was so friendly and outgoing!), and GREAT FOOD that was so well priced! We tried the pound of wings, onion straws, tacos, and chicken bacon burger, and everything was incredible. Wish I could give this place 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Classic dark bar with great food. Got the 1000 Island burger w fries. Double patty w dressing on the side so its not a soggy mess. Fries were surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Seriously the nicest people ever. I'm so happy I found this place. Great food. Cheap drinks. Fantastic service"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch based on a good yelp review. Was not expecting it to be an actual bar, my mistake, but with that being said it's not normal bar food. My partner and I both goth chicken sandwiches and they were very good. With real and plump chicken definitely NOT cheap frozen breast. Full size brioche buns with the chicken sticking out the side! And the service was friendly and attentive!! 5-stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Looked up a bar to drop in while I was in the area..

Great Bloody Mary from Shannon! Neighborhood local chill bar, plays oldies on video like the Police, Beatles. 

Food was great had a chicken Avocado sandwich, tasty:)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great people, friendly atmosphere. good is phenomenal. bartenders are great"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with some friends who live in the area and I really liked it!

It's definitely a dive bar, but it's clean & the bartender (forgot her name) was very friendly. 

I had a couple of Blue Moons (I also had a couple jello shots...at $2 a pop why not?). There wasn't a huge beer selection, but I wouldn't expect there to be at a place like this.

We split an order of fries, which were good. It was a pretty large portion. My friends who I was here with said they've had other stuff off the menu that's good as well. 

Very inexpensive! 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great experience!  Was in town for a work meeting and stopped in for dinner on my own afterward.  Great casual atmosphere and they had a $10 burger and beer special.  I got a great tasting double bacon cheeseburger and fries along with a pint of San Tan Amber craft beer.   The bartender/ waitress was very attentive.  All for $10! (Plus tax and a nice tip). 

What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place several months ago.   Started going here and sad I  hadn't sooner.   Great prices, service and food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar now. CLEAN, GREAT FOOD, COLD BEER, and JEN. It's a quadfevcta....

I hit this place up 3 days a week and always solid."}
{"text":"If I could give this fine establishment 10 stars, I would. The exterior and interior cactus lights were very welcoming and cheery. The bartender/server, Susie, is one of the friendliest servers I've ever had. Great appetizers include the onion strings (they were recommended, so glad we tried them), and wings. The beer (Stella on tap!) was icy cold and fresh. Diamondbacks game was on a few flat screens, and other clientele looked comfortable and laid-back. The charming decor, cleanliness, and cozy vibe that the Cactus Tavern radiates made it extra special. Especially the ladies restroom...ladies, you HAVE to check out the restroom. This sounds weird, but it was the best bar bathroom I've had the pleasure of visiting. I left the Cactus Tavern feeling extremely satisfied with the experience and am excited for a return visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent neighborhood bar! The clients are friendly and Kristin is such a great bartender! Service is quick, friendly, and you really feel at home here.  Recently tried the food--it hit the spot after a couple beers.  Keep up the great work Kris!"}
{"text":"We definitely love this place for many reasons BUT there is one issue I'll touch on last. The bar is clean, bartenders are friendly, prices are good, tv plays variety of music videos, great atmosphere and great people! Great place for happy hour! Now for the bad issue....many reviews say great food....I know this is a bar and should expect bar food but if any of you actually saw how the food is prepared? you would choose not to eat here like we have. Only drinks for us! Last night we watched the cook not wearing gloves, cleaning kitchen, wiping his brow many times (assume because of sweat) handle raw chicken then assemble a burger plate and ate a fry off the guests plate. I mentioned no gloves right? And then touching raw chicken and then handling ready to eat food right? Didn't see him wash hands at all only wipe them off on a towel. Also saw other cook putting flour on onion straws in fry basket while she was holding it over trash that was over flowing and touching the bottom of basket, she was wearing gloves though....we aren't oblivious this could be happening anywhere we eat but my fiance' has been a chef for about 30 years and we both witnessed many serve safe violations. We will continue to be patrons but just drink!"}
{"text":"It's a real bar.  Kind of loud, kind of dark.  It has a pretty good vibe though.
The beers aren't that cheap, but the bar food was tasty, the server was nice, and they bring in fresh flounder from Rocky Point to make the fried fish.
Not gonna lie, that fish is on my mind.
A lot."}
