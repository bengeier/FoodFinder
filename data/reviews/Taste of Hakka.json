{"text":"Garbage Service!!  Made me wait for 45 mins for take out! Didn't even eat the food yet and I writing this review! Of you value time! Don't go!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this in the area, insider is comfortable clean and stylish, everything I ordered is very delicious and the price is also reasonable, definitely worth to try and will come back again !"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. We had steel wool remnants and thick black hairs in our food - which is absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. Never go here unless u want some random guys pube lookin hair in ur food. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Food is just average - nothing unique or outstanding. Would it be a place I would come back? No I would not - but if it's the only place around - it's fair enough.  Also, although they DID fix our order, the fact that it took so much convincing that they got it confused.   Idk why it was that hard to say \"oh no worries we will change it\".   Ah well."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time.  We were really impressed.  Great food and huge portion sizes.  Friendly staff.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great place for Hakka food. The food here was delicious, and very fresh, we had the chicken pakoras, hot and sour soup, Hakka chow mein, deep fried fish and chilly chicken.  Very friendly staff I would definatly visit again.  Do ask the server for recommendations and inform them of any food allergies and if you do not like spicy food make it know to the server."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! I live the food!  The chilly chicken, pad Thai everything I drive half and hour each eat because it is delicious! Make sure you give it a try hard to find a great restaurant nowadays and this is it"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night to order take out. There were already 8 people before me so I was a bit skeptical about the time but it only took around 25 minutes.   Now onto the food...  The food itself wasn't bad. The manchurian spicy fried rice and spicy chow mein were pretty good! Not the best I've ever had, but still good. We also got the spicy garlic chicken which wasn't that great. It was pretty bland and didn't really taste like anything.   All in all, it's not a bad place but there's definitely better in the area!"}
{"text":"What their food lacks in flavour, they make up for with enthusiasm. The staff is truly passionate about Hakka cuisine and are quick to offer suggestions for first- timers. Unfortunately while dining here I found myself reaching for the salt shaker more than once... the only spice/ seasoning that seemed to be used was black pepper. I tried two dishes; Black Peppercorn Chicken and Chilly Chicken (the latter was highly recommended by our server) and I have to say neither offered much in the flavour department.   I did enjoy their Potato Spring Rolls though. Those were unique and quite tasty ."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to stop by for dinner on our way home from the mall. This is the first Hakka place in Vaughan that I have been too. We were expected a huge line up but thankfully it wasn't that busy when we went.    It's all small restaurant with very sweet staff. The lady at the register was so nice to talk to. They provided us with the menu and we placed for order for take-out. The wait for the food was not long, about 10-15 mins.   We order the Bombay chicken, Manchurian chicken, veggie Manchurian, fried rice, spicy Hakka chow mein noodles, and two spring rolls. Everything tasted amazing! There were no complaints on the taste or the food. Will definitely be going back.   All the best in the new business! :)"}
{"text":"Recently heard that a hakka place opened up in my hood so I thought I'd give it a try. Ordered the chicken pakoras and bombay chicken to go and the odor in my car driving the food home got the taste buds going.  The pakoras are red in colour, actually kinda dark brown. The taste wasn't bad and will hold you over until you manage to visit Fedricks (cuz that is the benchmark when it comes to hakka in the 6).   The bombay chicken was something I thought I would give a try although I normally get the chilli chicken. The flavours were similar to the chilli chicken dishes i've tried in the past and on my next visit I think I would go for the chilli chicken. Steam rice accompanied this dish and portions were generous as as is typical with hakka dining.   Next time I'll dine in and try the Manchurian dishes as previous Yelp reviews commented that the spice level was on the mild side. I however felt they were enjoyable enough! But know I can eat hot!!  Glad to have this place close to home! See you again."}
{"text":"Meh. Food tasted pretty bland to me. If you are going to open a Hakka joint a piece of advice don't be shy with the chili, garlic and ginger or else you are just serving greasy, low quality food. I ordered chili chicken dry extra spicy and it wasn't hot at all. Biggest pet peeve is restaurants holding back on the heat because they've been scared by mungee cake diners who can't handle any  heat at all. When I go for Hakka, I want the f'n heat. Suggestion.. the chef here should go hang out with the dude at Federick to get a clue."}
{"text":"Just ordered the most bland basil chicken I have ever tasted. It isn't just flavourless, there is this weird burned plastic undertone. The waitress disappeared after bringing my food 15 minutes ago, so I couldn't even ask to send it back to the kitchen. Gave up on having the waitress ever return to my table and brought my plate back to the kitchen where they said that this is just what basil chicken is supposed to taste like and they can't replace it. Will definitely steer clear of this place in the future."}
{"text":"A nice find for the woodbridge-maple area  Tried the deep fried spicy fish and the chili chicken and both were good.   The fish was really good and i will definitely be ordering again.   The chicken was good as well but felt a little wet for the dry variation, all in all it was good and would probably have been better had I not done take out and had it get soggy from the container (food for thought for those calling ahead). I'd give it a 3.5/5 I've most definitely had better but due to location I can see myself ordering again.   Will be sampling other offerings from the menu."}
{"text":"This is a new place opened and i went ordered chilli chicken, chicken pakora and hakka noodles. All of three were very nice in taste. Good hakka resturant needed in vaughan. The only thing i say is they are short staffed and overwhelmed. They need to figure out to improve service and that is why one less of 5 stars. Be prepared to wait for 45 - 50 mins during weekends for food takeout or dine in."}
{"text":"Largely avoided Taste of Hakka, as there are more reputable and well-reviewed Hakka places. However took a chance and it went beyond expectation. Food was as excellent as those in Scarborough, but without the hole-in-the-wall vibe (as most of these places are... which makes it a hassle when you want to celebrate a more formal occasion). Ordered: Chilli Chicken Dry, Dry Saut√©ed Beans, Hot and Sour Soup (to start) and everything was delicious! Ingredients used were fresh and you taste the spices used. Being a person who went to a couple Hakka establishments, my experience was on par with the best of them. We thought the chilli chicken could use a bit more crisp, however when we relayed this thought, our server said to mention it next time and they will have it done right. To emphasize, there is nothing wrong with that. Some people prefer the chicken to be slightly soft, and some prefer it to be much crispier. Even without the slight preference, I would rate this a 5/5. Not sure why this place is 3.5 stars, but it can be that most of the reviews are takeout. Since the chicken was slightly soft, it may end up soggy at the end of the trip when one does takeout. Regardless, I will be coming back with friends and family, and definitely recommend dine-in, as opposed to taking out.  ****** Update:  Tried their takeout, and seen no problem. Although, I have requested for the chilli chicken to be crispier, so when it goes home it will be just right."}
{"text":"Updating to 5 stars as i've been here a few times and it only gets better  Some surprises too like how GOOD the hot and sour soup is.  Also love how cheap and fast their lunch specials are. $8.99 for a large lunch which includes main, choice of rice, spring roll and soup or pop.  Love this place"}
{"text":"This is my  new go-to place for hakka food.  Passed by this place and was hungry for something different.  This is mainly a take-out place with a no frills interior.  Order ahead of time as they make everything fresh (no heat lamps here).  Their Singapore noodles are spot-on and the chili chicken (no gravy) is the best chili chicken in the city.  The dishes come with steamed rice.  The portions are big enough for 4 people, so order wisely or save some for the next day.  One star off for not including enough chili sauce with the order.  However, very happy with the food and truly hakka."}
{"text":"Great food!! We ordered Bombay paneer and spicy Hakka noodles, loved it. The place is clean and service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, nice staff.. my go to place when im craving chowmein. Prices are good too."}
{"text":"Finally a great Hakka restaurant in the area. Small place but nice decor. Food was very good with the chiness and Indian fusion. Hope the quality keeps up for being so brand new. Very large menu but that's the norm."}
{"text":"Good place to have lunch.  They have lots of options for lunchtime for the price of 8.95 plus tax. Comes out to be about 11. I ordered the Manchurian beef and my friend got the general tao chicken. The Manchurian beef had the right amount of spice to it. But wish it had a bit more flavour. But after trying the general tao chicken and egg noodles it was great. The lunch meal also comes with a choice of soup or pop. We had the corn soup of the day, which I was good. I suggest trying that for a nice cold day. I am definitely goinf back to check out what more they can offer."}
{"text":"Great food and the portion is more than enough for the amount of money yout pay. I had the Manchurian Chicekn with rice, very flavourfoul and the sauce is not thick"}
{"text":"Got takeout on a weekday night.. Called in my order over the phone.. Seemed pretty painless to order.. Arrived at the restaurant.. It Didnt seem too busy.. A Few tables were occupied with customers..  Got Fish pakora.. Chilli chicken (dry)... Crispy ginger beef.. Quality and flavours were on point... Quite happy with the food..  10% discount on takeout orders over 25$ paid with cash.. Thou generally the prices are a little more compared to other hakka restaurants Ive been too...  They asked if i wanted complimentary rice with my order.. Its free so of course i said yes.. Not sure why they would even asked.. (Hoping i would say no?)  They put some packets of hot sauce with my order.. But it appears they also have pre packaged containers of chilli sauce that they have self serve at their tables.. I had to ask them before they gave them to me..  close to my home so i am quite happy to have a Hakka restaurant nearby.. Likely to get takeout again..."}
{"text":"Not impressed.   Found black hairs in our food.  Waitress seemed unconcerned, as she was preoccupied with take out orders.   As we left, drove passed back doors and saw Cook sitting on a pail smoking cigarette in his apron.      Definitely a bad sign .  Sorry to say, this was a bad experience."}
{"text":"Visited this new establishment over lunch hour for take out. I love how fast their service is.   I had the peanut chicken dish which was alright. I asked how spicy was it and the man had said it wasn't too bad. Well friends, it was prettttty spicy. I was actually sweating.   I'd be happy go back another day and try other items on the menu. Good price for the serving size."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for chinese take out. They are always good and consistent. We often order the dinner for four, but truthfully am much happier when we order a la carte. I find that the dishes on the pre-set menu pretty much taste the same."}
{"text":"Ordered the Curry Chicken. It was aight. Took around 20-25 mins on a Saturday afternoon to receive order. The experience overall was mediocre, the food & price was great but the customer service was ok"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on here, my family and I decided to come here and now we're frequent customers here for both dine-in and take-out! Our favourites include the Spicy Special Fried Rice (really spicy!!), Special Hakka Chow Mein, Lemon Chicken and Hot & Sour Soup. The dishes are flavourful and quite large portions. The servers here are polite and provide great service.   If you're around here during the afternoon, their lunch specials are worth trying!"}
{"text":"Staff and service was great however the food was terrible. We ordered take out and found a long black hair in our chow mein. Also found the chili chicken was soft and mushy. Family was grossed out by the hair so we won't be going back. Disappointing since we were excited to see it open."}
{"text":"PAID FOR NOODLES, but got rice. Don't think I will return.    Since the moment I walked in the man taking my order was in a rush and could barely let me finish. Then when I was about to pay she to make sure everything was right, the lady cashing me out said \"one noodle one rice\" I thought \"okay she knows what I want\" obviously she didn't. Don't bother going here."}
{"text":"This is an Indian/Chinese fusion place. Fairly small (I think only 8 or 10 tables). Most of the dishes were either Indian *or* Chinese, not a combination, but there was one Indian chow mein on the menu, which is interesting, and of course you could get your Butter Chicken with fried noodles! :)  A group of us came here for lunch. $8.95 lunch special, each of us got something different, we all really liked our meal and were filled up. 3 of us loved our meals, Jessica enjoyed hers but thought that they should have specified that the Bombay Chicken was fried chinese-style. Personally, I don't think that was such a big deal since it is a fusion place."}
{"text":"Went for take out. The order was ready on time on a long weekend Sunday. Not bad for veggie noodle dishes.  Wish there were more veggies though. Will try more dishes in the future."}
{"text":"It was alright. I got the chilli chicken and my boyfriend for the beef with broccoli. It was very watery and not as flavourful as other places. The hot and sour soup tastes and looks like a msg filled heart attack."}
{"text":"Had to bump up from my original 4 1/2 stars. On my last visits, the food has been over the top good. Flavourful, spicy, plentiful, and fantastic ! Prices are reasonable. I highly recommend the spicy garlic chicken, chilli chicken dry, spicy vegetable rice, chilli beef.....however everything is good. Kudos also to the Bombay chicken and the Szechuan chicken.  Their lunch specials are a great price point."}
{"text":"Went back for lunch, apprehensive this time as I seem to have a track record of loving the first visit and then a total fail on the 2nd.   This time I ordered the \"lunch special\" Manchurian chicken which is my go to Hakka meal, it came with white rice, spring roll and choice of pop or soup for $8.95. I had the corn chicken soup which was safe and no spice, however, it was tasty. The Manchurian chicken was great! decent amount of spice not overly hot, breading was still in tack and some pieces were crispy despite being a saucy dish, no cartilage and freshly made.  I found the portion size I was given not large as others reported, I would say the size served was average. I feel $8.95 was on the steep side for this lunch special, most of the time this dish goes for 5.95 in most Scarborough Hakka establishments and I usually can't finish the plate. Substitutes were available for extra, I did not participate since adding to the already inflated price was not in my interest. If you are with a few people who enjoy the same, I would suggest ordering off the regular menu, seems a better value since most main dishes already include the rice.  As far as service, again no issues, they even came over to ask how everything was and if we needed anything else. Did not have any of the other issue my fellow Yelpers had in the past. Overall, I think this place is a hidden gem, Hakka in Vaughan! Who would have thought this was possible. I think I finally found my go to Hakka place out of Scarborough!"}
{"text":"We were feeling lazy one night so we ordered takeout from here as it is fairly close to our house. We ordered the chilli chicken dry, Bombay chicken with gravy, Manchurian beef and the dry saut√©ed string beans. The chilli chicken was spicy as it was covered with green chillies. However I did enjoy it and like another reviewer mentioned it could have been crispier if we ate in the restaurant but this is part of ordering takeout in my opinion. The Bombay chicken was also quite spicy but in a nice sauce. I'm not very sure but I wasn't under the impression that Hakka cuisine was supposed to be spicy. On the menu it does indicate Chinese Indian fusion cuisine in which dishes are spicy. The Manchurian beef came in way too much sauce it was almost like a soup. I probably wouldn't order this dish again. I found the beef a little chewy. I'm typically not one to order beef at a Chinese restaurant. The string beans were a hit they were seasoned nicely and weren't overcooked despite being in a takeout container. Overall this place is not blow me away but Chinese takeout places usually don't. I would order here again skip the beef."}
