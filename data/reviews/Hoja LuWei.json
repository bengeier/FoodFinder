{"text":"Traditional Taiwan street food with a much nicer setting. I fancy the pork combo with Hoya soup base!"}
{"text":"LOVED IT.  Been there for 5 times already since they opened.  They bring the street food of Taiwan here but added their own twist. Super great team working there in a chilled environment. LOOK FOR THE SECRET MENU when you go!"}
{"text":"My friend grabbed a FORMOCHA and I got an assam milk tea. Super yummy and good portion for the price! A good spot for a boba. The aesthetics are super cool for instagram pics. Definitely plan on coming back"}
{"text":"Love this place! This place serves authentic Taiwanese LUWEI and the whole setting of the restaurant also makes you feel like you're in Taiwan! The food is good, staffs are friendly too! Will definitely come back for sure! HOJA!"}
{"text":"Hmm...I want to be positive because being the first in downtown for anything can be hard but the flavor of the broth or ingredients really doesnt live up to the savory richness of original luwei. Suppose it would have been easy to please me cause I was starving too. I'm a small person so I imagine a lot of people would need to add ingredients to their 9.50 bowl.   I had the chili fish combo with medium spice but it was more like a mild. The tofu skin that came with it was blanched plain, not marinated in any way. The sliced fish itself seemed to not have absorbed any of its chili sauce so despite its tenderness, fell flat in flavor on the inside. Squid balls and fish cakes are a regular feature at luwei shops but I'm not sure it made the dish much better. Also, they really need to do away with corn and sliced red cabbage topping as it reminded me of frozen vegetable. I'm coming across pretty harsh, partly because I know how to make luwei and ate it before growing up, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't mean I can run a better business.   For spice and salt levels, I would really prefer to get the \"choose your own ingredient\" malatangs at the northern Chinese establishments on spadina and dundas than this place."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this small little noodle joint. We customized our orders, one lamb and one pork with thick noodles and hoja broth (with options to add other condiments etc). The food was okay, nothing too crazy or special that I'd come back for. The thick noodles were a bit undercooked and very hard/chewy but i didn't mind. The art work and decorations were pretty cool throughout the restaurant. The service was a bit confusing for me as I thought it was a pay upfront then seat yourself... but I guess you can seat yourself and get served by the waiter/waitress, then pay? Overall, wouldn't come back. It's a one time thing for me."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant for winter. Nothing beats build-your-own warm soup. Plenty of choices to choose from for your luwei, from different kinds of tofus, fish balls, meat, and broths! The hoja broth is my favourite. The sweet chilli is not bad either, but it's more of a sauce than a broth. I always go for their slightly chewy thick noodles. The in-store bubble tea is a huge plus. The servers are so courteous and food arrives fast."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through Foodora. From the reviews, I was expecting a small portion but it was substantial (and I have a big appetite). The flavour is okay - but only if you like Chinese medicinal herb tasting stuff (I do, but feel that it is an acquired taste if you didn't grow up with it). Both of mine tasted like that. I like that they give you plenty of toppings. I tried the veg combo with both the Hoja broth (spice level: \"mild\") and sesame (spice level: \"medium\") which is basically the Hoja broth with sesame paste added, I think. Both were very, very spicy. I had to pull out several cut up pieces of fresh chiles (seeds and all). I don't know why there were even chiles at all in my \"mild\" order as the broth itself is already a bit spicy. In fact, my stomach hurt a few hours after eating (which is what happens when something is too spicy for me) and while I was eating, my nose was running and my scalp was sweating.. this was for the \"mild\" broth. I had to stop drinking the broth altogether towards the end of it. The sesame has a lot less broth/sauce so it was spicy but didn't burn as badly for me in my stomach.. just in my mouth. I am someone who does add hot sauce to dishes sometimes and I usually order \"medium\" when I eat anywhere, and usually find Canadian medium to be pretty mild. This should help you gauge how spicy their levels are. Next time I will strictly specify NO chiles! I don't know if they just got my order wrong or what, but it was ridiculous and I was in pain. It was hard to enjoy because of this. I also ordered the taro coconut drink which was tasty (no extra sweetness). The coconut milk probably helped soothe my burning tummy from my \"mild\" broth noodles."}
{"text":"A Taiwanese restaurant that specializes in Luwei. They offer take-out and dine-in options. Service is pretty good: water refills come and they check up on you from time to time. They also have a Formocha station inside the restaurant if you're looking for some bubble tea.  Their menu consists of noodle soup or rice with over a dozen different vegetables and proteins to choose from. The way it works here is you will build your own bowl by selecting   1. optionally, rice or noodles (there are a variety of noodles) 2. optionally, protein 3. optionally, vegetables (over a dozen options) 4. optionally, sauce 5. optionally, spice level  Each item costs a certain price (from 50 cents to $2), and you can pick and choose based on factors like your diet, what you feel like eating, and how much you want to eat.  They also have some pre-selected bowls on the menu that you can choose, if you want to just try a bowl without having to think about what you want in it. But even if you choose one of these bowls, you can still customize them.  Once your order is done, take a seat and wait for the food to be prepared. It takes a couple minutes to boil all of the ingredients, but we didn't wait very long before the bowls were ready.  The first thing that stands out about the bowl is the amount of variety that comes with your meal. Most noodle places generally only have a few items, but here you can easily have 7 or more different types of meats and/or vegetables.  The broth is very flavorful and quite unique compared to a lot of other noodle soup restaurants. It is definitely one of the highlights of the meal, so definitely try it or finish it. if it's not spicy enough, there is hot sauce available to use.  If you're looking to try a different kind of noodle soup, you should check this place out."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends, one of the friend ask to go try out this new Taiwanese Lu Wei place since he lives in Taiwan and visiting Canada.   So we got there two peoples at first and the other friend was running late so we ordered two bowl of the noodles and our own choices.   My friend said there should be more selection if you are in Taiwan and lots of the basics selection they don't have it like wings or intestine and others.   For me, I ordered the soup noodles with my own selection. I find the soup don't have enough flavour and just looks like Sichuan ma la tang but with no spicy or flavour. Noodles was not as good and most ingredients was too simple and not so special that u can make it at home.   So, we ordered for our friend who is coming late for like 20-30 mins and he didn't even get his bowl of noodles before he get to the place. End up the waitress said that need to wait another 15 mins if you want the noodle soup cause they run out of soup. So he end up getting the one without soup.  Maybe is still soft opening but if a restaurant can't do a good soft opening customer will not come back or even try your place."}
{"text":"A new taiwanese place that has a lot of good traditional food. This place is a little bit out of the way for me, but it was a quaint place to visit.   The seating is very limited. It was very cozy, but very very small. If you are expecting privacy, you won't get it here.   The food was pretty good. You get to choose what you want in your dish as well as the different noodles available. The selection is fantastic, but the prices not so much. My own noodle cost $18. Didn't realize how much it was until after the selection. i just kept on loading it with everything.   The real down side to this place is the bugs. We had a lot of fruit flies everywhere. After a while, I just couldn't eat because i thought some of the flies got in my soup. If you put down your chopsticks, they just start landing on it to eat. Not the cleanest place......  Overall, I would give it an average. Usually, i would give this place a 1 star because i hate bugs, but the food made up for it a little."}
{"text":"Bad dining experience: Food was OK. I can tell that their soup was really home made. However, the service really needs improvement. One of the staff accidentally poured the dark broth onto my friend's shoes. All they did were just apologizing and handing us a bubble tea. We did not want the bubble tea! We did not make a scene right there but to be honest, we expect there were at least some more sincere apologies and some realistic actions. What really matters is their attitude. But as a customer, I did  not feel to be respected or valued in that sense. Just imagine if those were your shoes or your shirts that were ruined."}
{"text":"Hoja is the first Luwei restaurant that I have come across in Toronto.  In fact, it was my first time being exposed to Luwei.  I appreciate how much care the owner puts into spreading knowledge about this culinary art; definitions are inherent in the signs outside and the staff members explain the concept to all new customers.  Aa such, the owner deserves some major props for opening this restaurant in downtown Toronto rather than up north so that more people from diverse backgrounds can learn about Luwei.  There is a DIY aspect to dining here. You choose your broth, vegetables, protein, type of carb (rice/noodles), and level of spiciness.  Therefore, Hoja can cater well to picky eaters and it is a good spot for returning customers to mix up a new combination during their next visit. Just remember that there is a price for each choice, so be careful to do your mental math before ordering.  If it's your first time visiting or you don't have any particular preferences, Hoja has your back as well. Their pre-set combinations with various proteins have a set price and you're guaranteed to get a variety of ingredients.   For my first visit, my friend and I ordered the pre-set beef combo and the pre-set lamb combo.  We both got thick noodles, Hoja House Special Broth, and medium spiciness.  I enjoyed the meal, but I did have a few gripes:    - The ingredients were the same when we compared our combos, but what was uncanny was that the lamb and beef slices tasted almost identical to one another.  - There were very few slices of meat in the pre-set combinations.  - Since they chop and cook the ingredients per order, there is a ''raw'' aspect to the meal. Specifically, the vegetables and noodles are on the harder, crispier side compared to what you find at other noodle restaurants.  This could definitely suit the taste of others, but I prefer noodles and vegetables that have softened a little first. An easy fix for me was to wait 10 mins before eating. It still remained hot, so don't worry about eating lukewarm food.   Nonetheless, Hoja has some great highlights, such as their strong level of spiciness, their fluid DIY transactions, and their great flexibility with the composition of the meal.  Even if you have an average or poor experience here, don't write it off. If you tweak your selection of ingredients/broth/spiciness and possibly let the meal ''sit'' for 10 mins to soften (if that's your thing), you'll have a hearty, flavourful Luwei meal!"}
{"text":"Friend and I chanced upon this place because of the grand opening banner, and it is a clean, relatively small Taiwanese restaurant (10 seats approx).   We had the option of choosing food options (eg fish, fish tofu, pork, beef, veggies etc - pay per item) to put in our bowl of broth/sauce with a choice of vermicelli/rice/noodles (pay per item too), as well as the option to choose from already set beef/fish/pork etc combos if you are too indecisive or confused by the variety of choices!  I personally got the pay per item because I wanted options that weren't in the combos, but for value of money, I would definitely recommend the combos! I got the broth which was slightly spicy but with a nice tang to it, and there was quite a bit of food for a satisfying $10. However it isn't extraordinarily yummy, just a normal satisfying meal and something that is not usually seen in the throngs of Korean restaurants in Koreatown."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago and wanted to find cheap eats . Cool concept and you can customize your noodle soup. I found the broth has a really strong Chinese herbal flavour which I am not a fan of . The noodle was cooked well but not as al dente as magic noodle's . Quite disappointed and thought i would not return any time soon."}
{"text":"Just left this really cute spot and had a great experience! I ordered vegetarian LuWei with the house broth. It was perfect for this fall day :)  While the food and the free bubble tea (they had a fun game for their opening) were delicious, the best part was the staff. So kind and accommodating!  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"***SERVICE ALERT*** 1st time 1 Star review and 1st time no tip my entire life. today's my second visit, but unfortunately not a pleasant one. One of the staff poured dark broth onto my sneaker and my friends leg. The staff apologized and that's it. Few minutes after she can back with a bubble tea as an apology, I said no worries at the time but you have to know it's only my manner and it is NOT OKAY at all. We advised a young guy who seems to be their manager or supervisor, only response we got is \"ya I heard the incident, my colleague told me about it, sorry huh\". REALLY???? No sincere apologies no free bill no discount no nothing but a bubble tea??? I took bubble tea because why not? You can at least offer a cleaning service so your customer know that you CARE, and you are trying to provide excellent customer service. All you customer want is just seeing that you are trying to make this right and I'm not seeing it at all."}
{"text":"FYI LuWei essentially means hot pot.   However, We ordered the \"secret menu\" item -- 5 spice pork, with radish, daikon, tea egg, on rice (not on the main menu). SO YUMMY!! You can order that any day apparently. If you ask for \"secret menu\" they'll give you what's pictured here!  My mom is from Taiwan and she thought this dish was delicious and very representative of taiwanese food. \"Reminds me of my childhood, and they even brought the food out in the same type of lunch boxes that I used in elementary school\""}
{"text":"I rarely review restaurants; who has the time? But to be frank, I feel compelled to review this place. Bottomline, I want this place to stay in business. No, I NEED this place to stay in business. From the first meal I had here, it was love at first taste. Since then, I've been a Hoja addict.  How could anyone not be? Though you might not even notice it at first glance, what goes on behind this tiny colorfully decorated little enclave is nothing short of culinary alchemy.  And as far as I know, there are no other places that even compare!   I will admit, though the menu is simple enough to navigate, the sheer amount of choices available can be a little dizzying. Having gone over ten times now, I've had a chance to try a lot on the menu, and it's all very good; fresh and flavorful every time. However, as far as I'm concerned, there is one dish truly that takes the cake. If you're not sure what to order, please do yourself a favor and try this combination.    Veggie Combo - Mild Hoja broth, add chicken (or any protein really) - add the spiced egg and my favorite are thin noodles.   The hoja broth is hands down the best. It has this far away aromatic flavor, deep and rich, sweet and smokey, full of mystery yet strangely familiar. I find myself rolling my eyes with each bite. Because of the vast array of veggies, (cabbage, asparagus, corn, mushroom, bean curd, puffed tofu, lotus root, etc) each bite is uniquely refreshing and one of a kind.  To add to all this goodness, the portion sizes are huge. I mean HUGE. When the bowl comes, you may be a little overwhelmed. But don't be. Every time I've brought someone here and treated them to this dish, they finish it down to the last drop.  I wouldn't be surprised if one bowl could easily provide enough nutrients for the entire day.  If you like the richness of ramen, but find it be too thick and salty, perhaps leaving you feeling sluggish, and you like the lightness and parsimony of Vietnamese pho, but find that it doesn't fill you up enough or is too subtle in flavor, then the luwei at hoja is the perfect in between."}
{"text":"I was disappointed - the hoja broth tasted like sugared soy sauce and the toppings were nothing special. The pastry tasted pretty bland, just some breaded thing over flavoured custard.   This place gets points from me for the vibes though! It really reminds me of street food carts and felt very night market chic (if that's a thing you want)"}
{"text":"Within three weeks...They have reduced their food portion about 50%...That's insane. I went here more than 5 times, but the last two time were disappointing."}
{"text":"The shabby, sterile and strangely trendy decor really does a good job of reminding me of the many open street eateries and night market stands I've seen and ate at while in Taipei, and the place is just as small. But alas in Toronto's food scene, Hoja Luwei is a new face in a city crowded with ramen and pho places, nearby array of Korean shops and the like, and not a whole lot specifically Taiwanese.  It's a kind of mish-mashup of a noodle bowl that you're getting yourself into. From an easy to understand checklist menu, you can pick a prescribed bowl option and throw some add-ons, or make your own, with a dizzying limitless array of ingredients and options that all cost a pretty penny each, so pay attention to what you choose. It was helpful in having a staffer guide me through. A small selection of craft beer is on offer, and they even have a Formocha stall inside for some bubble tea fix.  Surprisingly my bowl was filling despite looking small. The spicy broth I chose has a good tingly warm punch. I suggest not going overboard with the toppings, not so much because each additional pick cost a finger there and a toe here, but because you may find it's too much to handle for a puny bowl to get it all mixed in.  It's a decent fun new noodle bar, but definitely not at street food prices.  {TTC: a couple blocks west of Bathurst subway station.}"}
{"text":"The music is really awful. There is some confusion entering, the space is small. If there is a line, I'd avoid. The beef soup was very good, great flavour, minimal on the broth and needs more meat. Did I mention the awful music...."}
{"text":"they just opened not too long ago. this is apparently taiwanese street food, and it's a pick your own topping, noodle, sauce, and spice level bowl of noodles. i picked the thick noodle and lamb, medium spicy. it ended up pretty spicy and broth was also a bit salty, so i was drinking a lot of water while eating. the noodles were good and chewy, and the other toppings seemed like hotpot quality - it ended tasting pretty homey. they had lots of toppings that i like so no complaints there. i like that they had a container for chopsticks and napkins at each table -convenient, but the water counter seemed like it could be harder to navigate to if it ever gets crowded, it's beside the checkout station so you'd have to navigate a line, since the entire space is quite small with the kitchen and bbt section taking up most of it. speaking of the bbt, they also have a formocha, and while i haven't tried at this location, i have tried at some other locations and it's pretty good. i hope they do well."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to check out this place since BlogTO really plugged it.  The noodle joint is attached to a Formocha bubble tea location, so you can also get bubble tea while you wait for your food.  Price-wise, it's pricier than other noodle places.  Probably even pricier if you build your own bowl.  I ended up getting the lamb combo with Hoja broth and a Hokkaido milk bubble tea.  It ended up being around $16-something, with tip.  Pricy.  Taste-wise, I wasn't sure what hoja broth was, so I picked that at the mild level of spice.  It was a bit salty, a bit spicy, wasn't too sure what I was supposed to taste.  The noodle serving was good, along with all of the other ingredients/toppings.  I'd come back and try some things again, but maybe skip out on the bubble tea since that added more cost to my meal..."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place. Very friendly servers and very clean.   They have a noodle bar and a bbtea and dessert bar.   This review is for the noodle bowl. I had the option of getting take out or dine in. I chose to dine in. I decided on the pork combo with thick noodles and Hoja broth.   The bowl were nicely presented. The broth had a sour tangy taste. It was spicy, a bit too much for me, but it wasn't bad. The noodles were thick and fresh. I liked them. There were a lot of veggies inside the dish and I liked that. My only complaint is that there were only 4 pieces of pork, which I thought I could have had more of.   Service was quick. The people were very friendly.   Overall, this place wasn't bad. Definitely has potential."}
{"text":"I won't repeat the process for how to order here. I've only tried the noodle combinations with lamb and beef. What I can say is that depending on what you decide to add, it can be fairly cheap ($6.50) to more expensive ($10+). Now I usually like my noodles and soup mixture pretty simple so it wasn't bad. I was expecting more chunks of meat like brisket but it was more like sliced up that you would use in hotpot.  Otherwise, it's decent for the price. Not worth going out of your way for. Not sure I'd be back."}
{"text":"Okay, maybe due to the fact that we live in DC and have slightly limited good authentic Taiwanese food option, we have different expectation though we are all very picky eaters.   3 of us did a weekend trip in Toronto and this place popped up when Yelping Taiwanese food. A friend really wanted to try intestine so we came here, and also met up with a local foodie who's been here before.  The place is bright, and staff was friendly. We came in a Sunday afternoon around 1:30pm. There were constantly people coming to dine in or pick up their to go order.  They had most of what we wanted, minus the intestine, but it's okay. Some popular items do tend to sell out early, so make sure to come early if you want a fully stock option.  We all ordered different items: soup, house sauce and sesame sauce. I really love my sesame sauce which was recommended by the staff. It gave a total different taste than regular Lou Wei. Everyone else all enjoyed their order and we agreed the flavor was very similar to what you can get in Taiwan.  It did take awhile to get our food and the service was overage, because the place was busy. The guy who took our order apologized for not checking on us when we were checking out, which I thought was a very nice gesture.  Will definitely come back when in Toronto next time and also, it would be perfect if they'd consider a future expansion to the south!!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is: a small bowl of noodle soup. Especially with tons of cheap options in korea town, this just doesn't make sense.  It's a bit confusing to order for a first time. They have nice servers who teach you about the process.  Kind of a hipster vibe.  The food is ok, but they need to almost double the portion size.  Design of the interior is interesting too"}
{"text":"As my first experience with LuWei (which is a typical Taiwanese street food), I appreciated Hoja's staff walking us through the process. The journey is simple: either pick a suggested bowl or make your own by going through a check-box paper. You can choose the type of carb, protein, vegetables, soup and spice level. The prices are clearly marked and all the items are clearly labeled in a glass box out front, so you can easily identify anything you are unfamiliar with. Once you've made your selection, hand the paper over, take a number and grab a seat to wait for your very own customized bowl!  The bowl of noodles is deceptively small looking, but it is filling. I liked that there were plenty of different flavors and textures. Usually there are only two or three different items along with the noodles, but Luwei provides alot of variety in every bowl. A great choice if you are picky about what you like with your noodles!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends had very disappointing experience at this place. We didn't get our water after sitting until we asked for the water after noticing the waiter gave the water as the girl who came later when she got sitted. And the food preparation was long, we waited for more than half an hour even the girl who came later sat beside us got her dish earlier than us. The most disappointing part was that I was tending to have the dish without the noodle since I didn't feel like to eat it and I already ordered a lot in the previous selection (around 23$ + Wheel cake). When the waiter came and pick up my sheet and he asked me to add the noodles or rice and I assumed it was included in my order, whichever rice or noodles since this is my first time so I added one order of noodle. And when I was having my food and I heard the waiter was telling the girl (sounds Taiwanese from her accent) sits beside me to skip the part of the rice or noodle because her order seems at a good amount of food. Lastly, I realized the noodle charged me for another 2$.  I'm just not happy about of the waiter told the girl that she has a good amount of food while he absolutely knew I couldn't finish my dish but still asked me to add the mains (noodles or rice). Their combo is $11 so you can know how much I ordered before the noodle.  For the wheelcake, I only ordered one piece and it took same waiting time as our boiled bowls. I can't imagine if a customer comes here has to wait that long only for a wheelcake... Chinatown has more similar places like LUWEI and much cheaper and more tasty than this place."}
{"text":"A unbelievable bad experience! I  ordered  beef  noddles  with asparagus, which  two  dollars addition! The  point  is not  teast at  all! And  it's  totally  not  worth 11.50plus  tax. Two  people  about  26dollars. Each  bowl  only  has four  slices  beef...... I  know:(.......I  should definitely go  to Korean  food!

{"text":"They forgot to put one of my ingredients in the bowl but I PAID for it. Took the order for takeout so I didn't take a chance to check until I got home. They also left my take-out bowl on the table for quite a long time before covering the lid. Bad customer service yo."}
{"text":"Saw this on BlogTO, and considering that I'm Taiwanese...I had to go here.  While there are Taiwanese places in Toronto, they're few and far in between the sea of Asian places to go to and often lost in the mix.  I went, and I was pretty satisfied with what they offered, I'm itching to go back again, and soon.   For anyone that has gone to Taiwan, or is Taiwanese, or has an affinity of Taiwanese culture, you'll understand why I rank this place so high.  Located in old Koreatown, between Bathurst and Christie stations, when you enter into the place, the atmosphere, decor and even down to the colour of the chopsticks, scream Taiwan right there.  With the metal stools and ceramic tabletops, you feel like you've been transported there.  It's a tiny little place, with no more than 10 (max 15) tables but it's meant for quick eats.  Get in, order, sit, eat, then pay.   Which moves onto the food, and I'll admit...I don't know what luwei even means so naturally looking at the menu I was immediately intimidated by it.  Luckily, the server there was gracious enough to run me through the ordering process.  Just as an FYI though, if like me, are unfamiliar with the ordering, simply go with the pre-set combos (ingredients are pre-picked), pick your base (noodles/rice), spicy level, and the sauce.  (Broth for noodles, and sauce for rice).  Their combos tackle the common basic proteins (beef, pork, chicken, seafood, lamb and vegetarian)..so it's really a matter of what   So basically the board kind of reminds of Freshii, in where there's a ton of selection and each ingredient has their own price tag.  If you decide you want to go the customization route, all the power to you, but do note that your pricetag will stack if you go out of control with your choosing.  I think the more times I go here, I'll have a good feel what I like.  As an FYI, they have various amounts of ingredients from meats to vegetables so really you can have different combinations every single time.    I ordered the chili fish combo, with thick noodles, medium spice level and their signature Hoja broth.  Came with fish pieces (not sure what kind of fish though), fish bean curd, daikon, cuttlefish, fish cake and bok choy.  That Hoja broth is bomb though.  A salty, sweet, rich broth that can't mistaken for any other broths out there (pho, ramen broth, any of the Korean stews).  The taste is distinct and it's absolutely perfect on a cold winter day.  Dare I say, I rather have this than pho/ramen #straightup.  A lot of broths and soups I have, personally for me are too salty for my liking.  I literally can not fault this broth in any way...     Noodles cooked to perfection, perfect al dente cook on my noodles, and generous portion of all the ingredients that came with my dish.  And there was this pickled cabbage on there that brought for a sour/vinegary/sweet taste to it that gave yet another dimension to the dish.  All in all, the overall dish was perfection.  Ordered a bubble tea w/tapioca, which I think is backed by Formocha so I'm not sure if this should count towards this review but I'll add it.  (50% sweet, less ice).  Great tea flavour, correct amount of sweetness and good cook on the tapioca...not over/undercooked in any way.   I would definitely recommend anyone to try this place, I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while searching for something different to eat. I was quite excited of the possibility of a Taiwanese Noodle spot downtown. I ordered the Veggie bowl and my boyfriend ordered a custom bowl, both with the Hoja broth and a milk tea with tapioca .   The noodle soups: Took awhile to come out and when it did the chicken on my boyfriend's bowl was cold. Broth was watered down and not that tasty.  I wasn't expecting much for the bubble tea and it was mediocre, wouldn't recommend getting tapioca unless it's freshly made because it was really hard.   And service was on par with the food. It wasn't busy inside the restaurant but they seem to be slow and overwhelmed when typing in orders."}
{"text":"Hoja Luwei specializes in Taiwanese street-style cuisine, located in Koreatown. You're given a checklist menu to customize your own noodle bowl with sauce or broth. If you are indecisive like me, you can simply check off one of their combos with pre-selected ingredients. If you are a picky eater or want everything piled onto your bowl, you have the option to select as little or as many ingredients as you like.  I was actually confused with the menu at first, so I was checking off the combo along with a bunch of other things. Once I realized my mistake, I immediately selected the lamb combo just to keep it simple. I went for the broth but I probably should have gone for the sauce instead because I prefer my food more dry. Nonetheless, it made a hearty meal that was perfect for the cold weather.  The shop is set up to have a \"street-style\" vibe, similar to the food shops that could be found on the streets of Asia. They have one long communal table with high seats and very limited tables that seated two people. Which makes for great lunches but not somewhere you'd host an event/dinner.  Hoja Luwei is an affordable restaurant that allows people to get a taste of Taiwanese street food. It's an ideal spot to drop by for a filling lunch or to have something to warm you up on a cold night."}
{"text":"Limited seating with an open kitchen and right next to it, is Formocha where you can get bubble tea and/or dessert.   One orders from a piece of paper, picking your protein, type of starch and sauce/broth for your meal of $11. Additional cost for more toppings.   The highlight for me was that it was my first time in a Taiwanese restaurant in which they actually play Taiwanese songs!!! I was definitely surprised!! It is rare and only some people will understand and appreciate what they did. You can hear it more clearly in the washroom, which is unisex, big and clean.   The food took awhile to arrive even though I was right in front of it. The soup broth could have been hotter in temperature. It looked appealing but it was average. Nothing yelled out Taiwanese. It looked like a copy of the popular Japanese ramen noodle bowls out there.   The waitress was helpful but it would have been nice if her English skills were better.   The red bean dessert was decent, but I wouldn't order it again for $2.88.   For a small place, I'm glad we weren't kicked out. I would only go back to try their Taiwanese snacks or appetizers since I saw other people ordering them.   Kudos for the Taiwanese songs - that makes the place an original."}
{"text":"3 stars for 3 reasons:  1) lack of seating. There is only 4 or 5 actual tables in the whole restaurant and a fast food type high table top. As a result my friend and I sat on a long table having to sit opposite of complete strangers. I'm sorry but even McDonalds have better seating. We also were told to get up and sit beside each other to not allow any empty spots beside us.   2) portion size. The portion here is very small, don't be fooled by their large bowl. It's very shallow so there is barely any broth and very little noodles. After finishing my meal I was still unsatisfied.   3) long wait for the food. We waited probably 15-20 minutes for the food and that's pretty long considering this place looks like a fast food restaurant. I'm not quite sure what the hold up is because they only have a few items on the menu.   All in all, not impressed. I would not recommend, this place doesn't have any unique feature and the food itself taste like any other noodle place."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!?  Their noodle experience. The Taiwanese experience.   You get to choose different types of noodle and then your own ingredients. You then pick a soup base and spicy level.   We picked the thin and thick noodle as the noodle type. In terms of soup base we picked the hoja sauce that they're known for. In terms of ingredients we decided not to pick our own ingredients rather than have their fixed choices. This way, we can choose more meat and seafood to try!   I thought the hoja sauce is good for marinating meats and tofu but it's too salty for noodle soup base because it's soy sauce based. The ingredients were alright, nothing I can't buy at the supermarket and make it myself. I thought the noodle experience in general was alright because there wasn't much effort needed to make the noodle bowl. You literally put the ingredients and noodle you request in the boiling soup. If there's anything that's special it's their soup bases.   It's really hot inside though. It's a very small restaurant and the kitchen is an open concept so more often than not, you will feel the heat from the stoves. The menu looked confusing on the walls at first, but the form that the servers give you will make it easier to understand.   LAST TIP?!  I wouldn't go for the hoja sauce if you don't want it too salty. The other soup bases are not as salty and can complement the noodle as a soup base better. If you don't want veggies, I suggest you DIY style."}
{"text":"Had pork and lamb combos, with mild traditional hoja broth. So yummy! Friendly service. Combos are $11 or build your own bowl."}
{"text":"I kept passing this place on Bloor and after seeing a BlogTO post on Hoja LuWei, I decided to give it a try.  My boyfriend and I went in and ordered just one bowl of lamb with thin noodles and sweet chilli sauce.   Place - The style of decor is definitely different and has more of a intimate, cozy hipster vibe. It's as if you went into a restaurant in Asia. I loved the different arts on the walls and the ceiling.   Service - The servers were very nice and they helped us fill out the sheet and walked through the choices. Later, the server brought the food and the bbts.   Food - Presentation was definitely instagram worthy. Loved the colours, bowl and the colourful orange and green chopsticks. As for taste...this is where it really confused me. The sauce was way too sweet for me and the all the different flavours didn't quite complement each other.   Overall, it was meh for me   P.S. BlogTO just hypes up every restaurant they go to. I never know what's really good or nah"}
{"text":"The flavour here is on point and service was extremely friendly. I've been here 5 times now and it's always consistent every time."}
{"text":"One of the best soups I have had in a while, completely different then Raman, or regular Chinese soup. Really excellent. The top 4 choices have everything in them, and the broth is excellent. With a beer and soup it was under $20, which I think is good value for the money as the soup is very filling."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Tried this place out for the first time and was not impressed by the food or the service.   How the place works: To order, you fill out these order forms and tick mark boxes beside what you want. You can either choose a preset combo or create your own dish. The form is straightforward to follow and has all the prices of each item. Once you fill it out, you hand it to one of the employees who then manually enters your order from the forms into their system and sends it to the kitchen.   The food: The food was overall kinda bland and I feel Iike it should've tasted better for what I paid. I created my own dish with chicken, various veggies, thin noodles, sesame sauce, and mild spice. The meal tasted like something I can make at home for less than 10 dollars. I ordered a sauce option and was told the sauce options (vs. the broth) would make my dish dry (E.g. like chow mein vs like Ramen) but my dish practically had broth and was very soupy. Also, some of the ingredients I ordered came in very wimpy portions. Not to mention, my friend and I both didn't get an ingredient we ordered on our order forms - we had to tell the employees who then had to consult their system and then the forms we filled out to see that we were right - there was an error in the inputting of the forms by the employee. We eventually got our missing ingredients after a while but we practically already finished our dishes. We were not impressed.   Final verdict:  2/5. Food was bland and portions of the ingredients were wimpy. And the entire system of ordering the food is so flawed and error prone. Why have the customers write our orders down on a form which is then manually entered into the system by 1 of many employees when you can simply have 1 employee take the customer orders? Don't think I'll be coming back again."}
