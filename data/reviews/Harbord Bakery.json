{"text":"Extremely fresh and tasty selection of breads.. Also freshly baked cookies and biscotties of all sorts as well as non-sweet stuffed pies. Yesterday was my second time stocking up there and I really enjoyed everything I got. It is true that it is a bit pricy. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The beef empanada , Chocolate mousse cake and cheese sticks were average at best.  Haven't tried their bagels but I doubt they compare to the  bagel shops in toronto.  Service was friendly. Decor was non-existent and the food was overpriced.  Unfortunately I don't have any childhood memories associated with the place nor am I a fan of overpriced average food to give it more than a star."}
{"text":"Where to begin. 1. Service is the pits. 2. Baked goods are questionable. 3. Prices are absurdly high. 1.  I was waiting in line for a cheese danish and a poppy seed danish.  The \"lineup\" was all over the place, with customers drifting in and out, picking up pieces and goodies from all over the store and then wafting back to the main line to order 'one more thing'. The young lady behind the counter asked 'who's next?' That's me. I placed my order and the owner zips in ahead of my server and takes the poppy seed danishes, exclaiming they were the last two and had just been requested by one of those drifting-in-and-out customers. But I was right there! Not the first time I was pushed out by someone shopping while they were \"in line\", but it will be the last time.  Not impressed. 2.  I used to love their cinnamon raisin bread.  It's addictive, like cake, and in my opinion, pricey at $6; so I usually scanned the 'day-old' bin in hopes of finding a loaf there. I used to score one every month or so, just often enough to satisfy my craving. But the last one was definitely off. It tasted weird and stale, and no amount of toasting would cure it. I decided to keep my memories of the good rather than risking another bad batch so I stopped buying it. On a related note, a friend ordered a birthday cake to be picked up on a Sunday morning which happened to be the first day of a major holiday. The bakery was jammed. He managed to get his cake which had already been boxed up, but when he opened the box later that day he found it was completely the wrong cake. The bakery did try and contact him to see why he had not picked up \"his\" order, but he was already out of town.   They closed for the holidays, and when they reopened the following Wednesday, what did I see on the 'day old' tray but my friend's cake, now easily over 4 days old, cut into 4 pieces, on sale for $2.50 - $3.00 a slice.  I knew it was his because the unique birthday name and inscription were still legible.  What a joke! 3. I once brought a dozen chocolate/almond cookies as a gift.  They came to $36 plus $1.50 extra for the plain white bakery box.  Pricey to me."}
{"text":"Based on the recommendations of the reviews on this site, I tried an empanada, a butter tart and a blueberry muffin. All delicious! Thanks, fellow yelpers!   I don't know how authentic the empanadas are, *as* empanadas. In the past, all the home made and store-bought (from specialty stores) empanadas I tried were rather different to these--on those, the pastry is drier and less flaky, and the filling somewhat differently seasoned in the veggie ones. These have been mostly Argentinean, Chilean and so on. People craving a taste of home with that specific kind of empanada may wish to check out one of the places that sells them at Kensington Market. But even if they're not like the other empanadas I've tried, the versions at Harbord Bakery do fall into the \"filling surrounded by pastry\" type of food genre (alongside savoury pastry puffs, samosas, empanadas, cornish pasties, etc. You get the idea)--and boy are they delicious! Next time, I'll try one of the meat varieties--I'm curious whether I will find them dry, as some others have mentioned. I'm also curious about the seasoning used for those. Regardless, suffice to say, the veggie ones were not dry at all (some of the previous reviews had pointed out that the veggie ones had some moisture to them, and it's true). They are fabulous!!  The butter tarts were lovely too--decadent pastry, and the filling had formed a crunchy, teeth-sticking crust on parts, and a more gently crunchy layer elsewhere on the treat. Just the way I like them!  The muffin had bits of oat on top and they were tasty--I'm not normally a big fan of muffins, but this was definitely a good one! All recommended. I've tried the shortbread and the cheese stick things from here before--also delicious!"}
{"text":"Love that the place opens so early!  My mission in going to this bakery was to try Challah bread, which I have always seen but never tasted.  The bakery is much more spacious than any other downtown bakery I've seen, which a variety of European pastries and breads that look like very high quality.   At this point, I only bought the Challah - 5.00$ for a loaf, which seems expensive for bread, but I guess a lot of extra physical effort needs to go into rolling and weaving challah... It was fresh and nice.   Overall, very positive experience. Will go back to try some of the their products sometime."}
{"text":"They've got a lot of different breads and desserts here, I gave their butter tarts a try and was very surprised and pleased. Very sweet and gooey without any raisins or walnuts, I'd come back for this one."}
{"text":"Fig chocolates are my all time favorite. They inject liquid chocolate into the figs and then coat the figs with same chocolate from outside as well. It's wow.... You have to try it to believe it. Also macrons are good, chocolate croissants are good. The pistachio biscuits are great. Next time I want to try their quiche though. I always go to the bakery section and get stuck buying all the chocolates and cakes."}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss. They have the best cheese blintzes and their soufganiot is worth waiting for Hannukha to come around again...but I've found the rest of their fare to be rather underwhelming.    It's fresh and customer service is very kind, but on the whole I wouldn't say it's mind-blowing, just your friendly neighbourhood Jewish bakery."}
{"text":"Harbord Bakery is a Harbord St. institution. It has been here since the dawn of time. The staff are very nice and the quality of the product can't be beat. I wish they were open later but that is just my own selfishness cause everything is so good. Don't go too late because they can run out of stuff and are very very busy. They have a good selection of cheese, crackers and tea as well. They have a little tucked away corner with kids toys etc. GO GO GO!"}
{"text":"Favourite bakery in Toronto.  The servers are almost invariably unsmiling and somewhat brusque, but it doesn't matter because everything found here tastes wonderful. Prices are steep but I believe this is because they use butter, cream, chocolate, nuts, etc. generously-- at least this is what the taste and undeniable quality of the ingredients suggests.  Best bets:  Cheese blintzes: to die for. buttery, very tender blintz, with sweet, light, creamy cheese filling that has the milky-sweat cream taste of ricotta as well as the faint tang of mascarpone/cream cheese. These are proof positive that God wanted us fat.  - empanadas: (moist, well seasoned, consitently delicious, buttery pastry. I do not wish to know how much fat is in a vegetable number here, as I enjoy pretending they are healthy AND delicious). - chocolate pistachio cookies: wherever the country of origin for these is, I want to live. Now. - cinnamon rolls: limited quantity, as with much of their amazing inventory. they are just sweet enough, with no icing, but a super soft, impossibly pillowy texture. - bagels: do not need butter. are insane. I want one now. - seed loaf: puts Cobb's to shame. expensive though. omega three's aren't cheap.  I could go on, but won't. Suggest immediate patronage."}
{"text":"I'm an insanely picky eater because I was raised by parents who said, \"If you don't like it, just leave it on your plate.\" Because of this I refuse to eat a whole manner of things and the majority of the time, I look at a menu and say, 'I have no idea what that is, I am not putting it anywhere near my mouth.'  However, my little trip to Harbord Bakery was one of the rare times where I just wanted to try everything, no matter how odd it looked (the last time this happened it was with food carts and street meat, so consider this a step in a classier direction).   I bought a few different things: Some chocolate roll cookies, some peanut butter cookies for my boyfriend and a loaf of cinnamon raisin bread. The cinnamon raisin bread is fabulous! It tastes a bit like a cinnamon brioche, I think. Light and fluffy and amazing toasted and smothered with my best buddy butter. The chocolate cookies disappeared in a scarfing-frenzy after a trip to the gym. They could have been a little chocolatier (word? I think not!) but I didn't exactly put the bag down to come write this review...  The peanut butter cookies, I have no idea. Peanut butter and chocolate/any kind of sugar is not a cause I support, nor do I feel peanuts have any place on a dessert menu. It's nothing against peanut butter, me and peanut butter go way back, It's just a personal movement with little, uh, movement. It's something that has remained solid through my transition from 'picky eater' to 'grown-up that eats leaves and other green things.' My boyfriend liked them though! They sounded quite crunchy? Sorry I can't give you guys more than that!  Minus one star because I found there wasn't enough labeling happening. I saw things I was tempted to try but didn't because I wasn't sure of what they were. \"Is that caramel brown or PEANUT BUTTER brown?\" See the first world problems I face?"}
{"text":"Just a knotch above supermarkets. Tons more in the city than will be worth the calories."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've had the chocolate babka quite a few times from here and it is to die for! I got the chocolate brownie and chocolate croissant for a change and they were both divine! The brownie was dense and rich, just the way I like it. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The Kosower's are absolutely amazing, I love each one of them. All the baked good are delicious. The coffee cake, challah, and fruit pies are my favourite. This is by far my favourite Toronto bakery."}
{"text":"Living across the street from this bakery makes life particularly difficult. Everything they make is good, from their sweets (Cherry-cheese, almond or poppy seed danishes), to their bread (Raisin Challah is to die for and so it their Rye) to their hot table (try a Chicken Empanada) and cold salads. It's ridiculous really!   Besides the fact that it can be a little expensive this bakery really never lets you down!"}
{"text":"Some of the things there are phenomenal, but be warned- this place is much more expensive than you'd expect. No idea why it has only one $.  On that note, sometimes splurging is well worth it for some of their delicious chicken cutlets, cheesy bagels, spicy cheese sticks, or croissants. The staff is generally friendly too.   There are some things that I wouldn't buy again, like the sufganyot (jelly donuts eaten over Hanukkah) or some of the cakes. Don't miss the empanadas though! They may not be traditional South American empanadas, but they are delicious!!   TL;DR- Most food is great, but it's rather expensive. And don't miss the empanadas!!"}
{"text":"I am really lucky to live within an easy distance of this phenomenal bakery. (Or unlucky if you're looking at my waistline!)  They have a good selection of traditional Jewish baked goods (babka, challah, amazing Rye bread) as well as croissants, danishes, cookies, etc. They carry pints of Greg's ice cream, which is very handy (and cheaper than buying a pint of Ben and Jerry's or Haagen Daz, actually).  Their quiches are amazing, and they have an excellent selection of prepared sandwiches and sandwich fillings, as well as teas, coffees, and artisanal cheeses.  The debit minimum is $5, $10 for credit."}
{"text":"This is a good as it gets in the world of baked good, rolls, buns and other treats and sweets. This bakery has Jewish origins, meaning there is a strong emphasis on bread and rolls and boy they do it right!.  Have been going since the 70's, when I would bike over with my parents on early weekend mornings. Still, this 5 star rating isn't based on just nostalgia, it is the high quality, excellent standards and great recipes that keep Harbord Bakery firmly anchored in this part of the city. Truly a step above, if you are a bread person. The place is big and the selection is varied and vast, so be prepared to grab a basket while you shop. Newbies will often get distracted by the selection of sweets!  Falling into the best I have ever had class are:  1) Their onion bun (clearly made for dunking in coffee)   2) Any selection of any their rye breads 3) The challah bread (dare you not to start pulling at it before you check out)   Finally, I have to give credit to their bakery style chocolate chip cookie, which is not like many I have had in the past. Nothing too fancy, but it stands out.    Harbord bakery has expanded greatly over the years with more selections and a large ready-to-eat hot and cold food counters. The Harbord Bakery is more an independent, gourmet, eatery AND a bakery at this point.    TIP: Head over early because people in the know, line up to snag their fix from the moment the doors are opened. Worth the trip, even if it is late in the afternoon, when things have settled down. I could spend hours in this place just smelling the air, infused with the combination of freshly baked breads, ground coffee and awesome."}
{"text":"Now that ive gone back a few times i really appreciate the variety they have on hand, from smoked fish (which is great), to prepared foods, frozen items, cheeses, condiments, all good quality and a nice alternative to the big box stores if you live near by.  Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"My congregation ordered a slab cake before. The letters on chocolate cake was blue and it looked strange. The taste was not bad as a slab cake. Their regular breads were fine, but their pastries were expensive and their tastes were just average."}
{"text":"There is no way I can be in the Annex area and not make a trip to this bakery. Truth be told, I have a serious sweet-tooth, but I also love fresh bagels. When I can't get to Gryfe's http://www.yelp.ca/biz/gryfe-bakery-north-york#hrid:qhbMugBXDrfcgBEmXCtQAQ/src:search/query:Gryfe's%20Bagels or Pascal's http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pascals-baguette-and-bagels-toronto for bagels I'm more then happy to load up at Harbord Bakery.   I love the sugar cookies with the jam in the centre, and find it hard not to eat all of them before I get home."}
{"text":"Lot's lot great treat's.  It's a must visit . Prices are high but well woth it.  I had the best butter cup ever...."}
{"text":"I stopped going to Harbord Bakery for months because I just got too frustrated with them, but I work near them, & today I thought I'd give it another shot on my way to work. It was a complete waste of time, & I ended up having to leave without getting any service.   The main problem is that if you want salads or hot food, you have to wait at a different counter, & no one works at that counter. I've tried flagging people down & it never works. I'm usually just ignored, & one woman who works there actually told me she couldn't serve me, because she officially works in the back, & no, she couldn't fetch anyone else to serve me.   & then if you do manage to get served at the salad/hot foods counter, you have to wait in a separate line to pay or get baked goods. It's completely ridiculous.   Harbord Bakery, why do you make it so hard for me to purchase your food? I want to, I keep trying to, & I keep having to leave your shop without any service."}
{"text":"I had my first bagel here in 1970, after 25 years of wonder bread (as in, wonder if it's bread). The Jewish population which once supported a range of unique food shops had started moving north after the 1950s, and the stores catering to an older wave of Jewish immigrants were vanishing one at a time.  But the Harbord Bakery has remained and adapted to new waves of immigration, intermarriage within the original family, and gentrification (or perhaps, Annexification) related to the U of T and downtown youth scene. The result is typically Toronto food fusion. A \"calandria\" (take out section) sells fast food that's not junk food -- empanada and spanakopita, for example (both excellent), as well as basic ingredients for prepared salads. But much of the old Yiddish cuisine survives, including bagels, challah bread baked for Fridays and lox and cream cheese and bagel for Sundays.  Foods and cuisines are not frozen in time, and more than any other item of culture, but, as I argue in my e-book Food for City Building, acquire the character of the place the food inhabits, even as the foods lend their character to the place.  Harbord Bakery is now co-evolving with Harvest Kitchen across the street, and with a range of restaurants catering to the young and restless. Adding yet another reason to linger in this area, and do an edible form of archeology, excavating layers of the city's history, while adding to the unique income and job creation stream of each village within the larger Toronto."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to this bakery for years. I'd probably give it four stars out of nostalgia, but it really deserves just three. It's a hybrid of traditionally Jewish baked goods and some pan-Southeast Asian prepared foods.   HITS: Excellent rye with caraway. Really good sweet and savoury gefilte fish. Cute gifts for children in the calandria. Cheese blintzes. Sprinkle cookies. French-style apple cake with custard and a sugared crust.   MISSES: It's criminally expensive for challah. No itemized receipts, so you have no idea what you're being charged for (or if the price being rung up is accurate). Unfriendly staff."}
{"text":"Go to spot at work for baked goods for office mtgs and parties. The chocolate croissants are delectable."}
{"text":"- great neighbourhood bakery. i wish i lived in this neighbourhood.  - all i can say is come here for the challah, challah (makes me wanna sing the chorus to this song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdtxoTjqNf0)"}
{"text":"This bakery has its followers though other than the bread option (Challah seems to be their mainstay) I didn't find it enticing. Few of the dessert options including the biscuits were quite mundane.  There are some cooked food options as well and from what I saw they all looked sad. Too bad my prime source for challah only sells their version on the weekends as otherwise this place would be a skip."}
{"text":"my only regret is that i'd never been to this bakery before last weekend.   perhaps with good reason since:  a) i can still fit into my skinny jeans now, and  b) it's a bit pricey when you consider how much i now plan to go. c) just cancel out a)  so, on my first and only trip i bought for a potluck:  i) 3 empanadas (veggie, chicken, and beef). The pastry for all is the same: really flaky and dry, in a good way. I preferred the veggie empanada because, when i forked into it, a small amount of savoury veggie sauce helped moisten the mouthfuls of crust. I found the chicken and beef fillings to be a bit dry to accompany the great pastry.  ii) Two handfuls of spicy cheese & anchovy bread twists. They were very crisp and buttery. I was surprised that they were sold by weight, rather than by the piece. I asked the cashier to pack them inside the box of empanadas, otherwise the twists never would have made it to their destination without crumbling. The potluck people liked all of the items.  Next time I go, I want to try the blueberry muffins. While I was there, a guy came in to purchase one, claiming to have 'come all the way from LA for these muffins'. Alas, the blueberry muffins were sold out. When told to come tomorrow, and mistakenly hearing 'come tomorrow at 4am', he wasn't at all fazed. Even though the cashier had actually said 'come tomorrow, call beFORE' so a few muffins could be held to the side for him, he wanted those muffins so bad that 4am was worth it! must.have.those.muffins."}
{"text":"It's a decent sized bakery with quite the variety of baked breads. They have a good selection of yummy tarts and their pistachio cookies are to die for! I also had their almond croissant which was alright but I've had better. Service was quick and staff members are friendly."}
{"text":"I like this place because it reminds me of the old Jewish delis/bakeries back home in Vancouver.  Stuffy, crampes, hot, delicious smelling. The goods themselves though can be hit or miss and the price you pay will be slightly higher than your premium grocer. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way for this bakery.  But I also would never pass up going in if I were passing by"}
{"text":"This is a nice bakery in harbord. Walking distance to campus. They have  variety of breads, Jams, cookies, muffins and cold salads as well. They have coffee and tea too. I suggest everyone who miss a nice bakery to check this place."}
{"text":"One of my favourite things in life is a good challah loaf and this is my go-to for that in Toronto. One particular experience I had solidified my loyalty to this place when on a Friday I called in to reserve myself a 'sweet' challah thinking this automatically meant a raisin challah. I eagerly got there to pick up my dream loaf and was devastated to learn that sweet didn't mean raisin and the last raisin challah had walked out the door just seconds ago. I was on the verge of tears (dramatic I know ) but the anticipation for this special bread on a Friday is just indescribable. The lady who worked there told me to wait a second.... and somehow she did a magical switch with somebody! My Friday was saved!"}
{"text":"I love this bakery. It offers simply delicious food, everything's always fresh, and of course the added bonus of chocolates, cheeses, sodas, etc. is great. If I'm going to buy lunch at work, I'll opt to pick up one or two small things here as opposed to a lunch special or sushi for the 2000th time on Bloor Street.   Point by point, this is why I love Harbord Bakery:  Salads- They have all the classics - black bean, coleslaw, chickpea, greek, artichoke, tomato/mozz, and probably about 10 others I'm not remembering right now. I can't recall if it's a rotating menu of salads, but there's always about 12 or available, the one's i've tried (black bean, greek, chickpea, slaw) have all been perfect (never overdressed, oversweet, or oversalted).  Sweet baked goods- Seriously, these make me feel like a kid again, I buy a little pack of cookies every few weeks and their my little calming morsels of deliciousness when I feel like I deserve a little break at work. It's great. The chocolate chip cookies are huge, but delicious. I've also had their checkerboard cookies, those classic ones with the jelly dots in them, and a handful of other things I can't recall right now. Always delicious.  Breadsticks- yea these deserve their own category, hey have them in plain, with sesame seeds, spicy, sprinkled with cheese... they have them in every variety and they are yummy. If I'm hitting that 3:30 slump at work, I bolt over and grab one to get myself feeling peppy.   Artisanal Sodas - I'm usually not a fan, but they have a great variety, my favorite is the lime-lemongrass soda.  Coffee - I'm shocked at how hard it is to get a decent cup of coffee in this city. This one is cheap, and it's good.  But my favorite thing is the Chicken Wonton Soup. Now, hear me out. This soup is perfect for if you're feeling under the weather, or are feeling fabulous and want to keep your good vibes going, It's light so you can eat it before you work out but it's also hearty enough to eat after your run. Seriously, it's no frills, it's delicious, buy it and thank me later.  There's tons of stuff in here I haven't tried yet, but I trust that I will eventually.   Last but certainly not least, the lovely ladies behind the counters are always smiling and ready to help. When I'm indecisive about what I'd like to get they'll make a recommendation without being in my face about it.  I want to live in this bakery. That's pretty much what I'm saying."}
{"text":"I used to love the Harbord Bakery, especially the cheese danishes...however, I ordered a cake to be picked up on Friday.  They assured me the cake would be baked that day.  I went into the bakery on Wednesday and there was my cake in the display case !!!!!!!  So, I will be serving a stale cake.  What's happened to my local bakery?"}
{"text":"This is a nice little bakery in the Annex that serves a great selection of breads, pies, and other treats. The food is reasonably good and tastes home made, but my one complaint is that it is a bit on the pricey side -- be prepared to open your wallet here."}
{"text":"Harbord Bakery is your average neighbourhood bakery...some decent items, some over-rated items.  ***As a note, I am presently not patronizing Harbord Bakery (although I haven't changed their rating).  They are leading the OPPOSITION to BIKE LANES on Harbord Street.  If you do choose to patronize them, I encourage you to mention your support for bike lanes in Toronto.***  The HITS:  I enjoy some of their small pastries and sweets.  They do some lovely challah bread.   I've also enjoyed the Danish and Ruggelach.    The MISSES:  Bagels (they seem to skip the boiling step giving them a bread texture).  Most of the cakes end up being oddly bland with boring cake sandwiched between even less flavourful whipped cream.  I'll also pass on the \"empanada\"-like pastries...anyone of Latin extraction would be a bit perplexed by these creations.  The SERVICE is also hit and miss.  I've had the sweetest staff ever helping me.  I've also had the bakery equivalent of an old cat-lady grade school librarian who's having a bad day.  OVERALL, this is a hit-and-miss bakery.  If you figure out what's good and what's not good, you can rely on consistency in those items.  The prices are a bit on the higher side.  As I said, I'm boycotting them until they come to their senses on the bike lanes."}
{"text":"While waiting for my friendly friend I popped in here to have a carb-attack. Most of the choice here is pretty standard for a bakery. The staff were friendly and quick to help me. I grabbed a chocolate croissant and some shortbread. The croissant was decent. Not the greatest but hit hit the spot. The shortbread fell a little short. It wasn't as buttery as I would have liked.   The pies and cakes in the display case looked phenomenal. I will be back to give them a try."}
{"text":"The interior is superb, very open and welcoming. Not the usual cramped kensington bakery.   Babka is constantly sold out...call ahead to reserve one. I favour the poppy seed danishes, knish and almond croissants. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Products are tasty but way too expensive for what you get. I suppose they have little competition in the area so they can charge what they want. Too bad, would be great to have a bakery like this that didn't cost an arm & a leg."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sunday.  Bought: 2 empanadas (chicken), $4 each. Croissant, has coconut inside, $4. Almond cookie, $2.75  They don't put prices on their merchandise.  Taste-wise, ok. Price-wise, expensive."}
{"text":"This is a great bakery! I get my rye and challah on here all the time. Bagels too. My favourite is the russian black loaf. oh man. Not the cheapest, but definitely worth it.  If you want that great rye with the crunchy crust go here, I guarantee you eat 4 slices when you get home even if you're not hungry!"}
{"text":"Sprawling layout and confusing organization makes the Harbord Bakery a maze of desserts and baked goods. I selected a chocolate croissant and was not impressed. Perhaps it was old stock, but the item was lacking a certain freshness. In general, the selection of baked goods were poor. I asked for a blueberry bun and they did not have. Neither did they sell bubkas or rugelach!! Come on now. They can do better than this."}
{"text":"This is a great bakery.  I buy their whole wheat bread.  It is so much better than supermarket bread (with all its preservatives)."}
{"text":"Paying this bakery a visit is an integral part of my daily morning routine. They have a vast selection of baked goods that are consistent in their high quality. The staff is also both helpful and nice!"}
{"text":"If I could give 5 stars to certain items, I would totally give 5 stars to the Challah bread AND my newest obsession, SCHNECKEN!  Only sold on Fridays, this wonderous thing is flakey and tender inside like a croissant, but stuffed with currants and topped with chopped walnuts and an incredible caramel glaze.  Sticky and sweet on the outside, but balanced by the flakey  layers of cinnamon dough below.  If you love Cinnabon, you won't love this, it's not sweet enough for you.  But if you are like me and find Cinnabon too sweet, but miss old school cinnamon buns and chelsea buns, Schnecken is the treat  you MUST TRY!  Order the day before if you want to guarantee you get one, they sell out fast and don't hit the shelves until noon or so I think."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Toronto, Harbord Bakery has served up the best in Jewish baking longer than I've been alive.   I write this review with a freezer full of Harbord Bakery products.    Regrettably, portion sizes have recently decreased while prices have increased. For breakfast this morning, I toasted a bialy-a flatter, sweeter, oniony-er cousin of the bagel. A proper bialy is about the circumference of a big dude's palm. These were tiny. Make an OK sign with your hand, and unless you're on a first-name basis with the Wizard Gargamel, chances are you could fit one through the hole. They do remain tasty, with crisp outsides and tender middles even after their term in suspended animation.   With apologies to baguette fans everywhere, there are only two kinds of bread worth buying on the planet. Both are served here. Workday lunches on Russian black, light or marble rye are well worth the carbs. Lights crusts and springy crumbs add body to the most anaemic sandwich. On their own, with just a bit of salted butter, they're perfection.  In old-country Jewish homes, Challah, made of finer flour with an abundance of eggs, was reserved for the Sabbath. Harbord's version is rich and deeply flavoured, glazed to an egg-washed shine and studded with sesame or poppy seeds. With the High Holidays approaching, it's worth ordering a gigantic crown of a bread, even if you don't celebrate. A raisin version, turned into french toast the next day might encourage you to convert.   Bagels err on the light side. Baked without parboiling, they lack the density and chew one associates with a 'real bagel'.  Served fresh, they're still perfect vehicles for smoked salmon and cream cheese.    Desserts are primed for sharing, or at least for breaking off a piece if you're the sort who can't truly enjoy a cup of coffee without a little something on the side.   Assorted pies and cakes are just fine, although a banana cream version drizzled with chocolate might challenge the upscale version sold further up Spadina Rd.   Chocolate cupcakes are smeared with thick chocolate icing and colourful sprinkles. More sweet than cocoa in flavour, they're childhood in wax paper. The french palmier is reinterpreted as a dinner-plate sized round of puff pastry lightly topped with caramelized sugar, then dusted with more sugar and cinnamon. It's outrageously addictive and impossible to place between 'snack' and 'dessert'. Seven-layer cake is coated in thick, hardened ganache. Alternating yellow sponge and light whipped chocolate icing need liquid support. I recommend coffee with cream and no sugar.   Depending on your appetite, danish with fresh fruit, cheese and/or custard are your best bet. Just this side of sticky; crispy pastry on the outside yielding to tender leaves inside. If you just want a bite, opt for the Rugalach; a lighter cookie dough rolled around chocolate, cinnamon or fruit preserves. If you're entertaining a crowd, a fresh chocolate ring uses more of that danish pastry, and plenty of the good stuff.   Shopping at Harbord Bakery is an experience; prepared items like salads, entrees and empanadas are dished out from a central island. Random freezers conceal juices, dairy and ice cream. A haphazard toy store takes up a third of the space.    The whole shebang gets 5 stars. How could it not? It feels like home."}
{"text":"Very simple ... on a weekend afternoon, just stumble over to this place, grab some fresh baked goods, and carry on about your biznezz.  All will be good."}
{"text":"MmmHmm. I love this place.   Another stop on my never-ending, early-twenties nostalgia tour, coming here always makes me feel warm and fuzzy and hungry for my youth. And some bread. Discovering the quiet dignity of Harbord Street was a revelation then, a humble alternative to walking home (ie, to my BFF's apartment) from school down College or Bloor.  As Erin said, they have been around forever, and everything just oozes with old-fashioned care, such as: the little cellophane bundles of cookies, each tied and labeled, and of which I can't usually resist the almond crescents. The empanadas are very good, though quite rich, with a flaky, buttery crust (quite a different style than what my recently-reviewed Jumbo Empanadas serves up), for which I am always on board.  The egg bread used to be such a staple in my routine, that I once had a dream that the shelf behind the counter (where they keep it, natch) was relocated to my kitchen. The pie- especially the peach- is so good that it changed the way I feel about pie. I crave it fortnightly, for serious."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Good quality food, good selection of baked goods, and service is always zip-zap prompt.  I've given H B only 3 stars this time, since the prices are $nutty$.  If you happen to be rich, then this isn't an issue, but I bought a cheese bagel ($2), and a chocolate danish ($9).  Since when should a bagel ever be $2 each??  There's a bagel shop in Kensington Market where their freshly-made bagels, are only $1ish each.    Just saying... expensive!"}
