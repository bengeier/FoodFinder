{"text":"Cafe 1010 is one of the best breakfast spots in Phoenix.  I highly recommend getting the pancakes- they are delicious!  Also, if you are on the go this is a great place to grab breakfast as take-out.  They have great service here!"}
{"text":"Juan and Emilio are the best! Fantastic breakfast, made to order and very affordable. Been coming here for almost 4 years!!!"}
{"text":"Quiet little cafeteria style restaurant has such great and inexpensive food! The salsa that I got for my breakfast burrito was to die for! I got 2 burritos and hash browns for $12, and it was so filling and delicious- made to order. Staff is friendly and nice. It looks like they're open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here in AZ on business and we were trying to find a reasonably priced placed that served breakfast before we headed back on the road to NV. This place only had a handful of reviews on yelp but I decided to give it a try anyways. This place has good food and the prices were super cheap.  Great place to eat if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"I walked half a mile away to check this place out since it was so well  reviewed. Turns out it's more of a basic cafeteria than a brunch restaurant. I came in looking for the counter where I can order, didn't realize I was supposed to push through the security turnstile/gate or whatever it is, I walked around and went in through the checkout exit and saw other people pushing through the gate. One wall was lined with lighted mini-fridges, most of them empty, as if this place used to be popular but they downscaled their stock. They have their menu printed up above a counter where you can order hot food, among which egg-based breakfast foods and burgers are most prominent. I ordered a club sandwich with cheese and side of fries. Was able to turn around and get a soda from the soda fountain while waiting. The wait was only about two minutes. I saw they do have a salad bar. I added ketchup to my plate from the dispenser and paid for my food, cafeteria-style (there are tray counters everywhere but no trays) about $10, and found a seat near the window. I tasted a couple fries. Average consistency but thick cut and nicely seasoned. As I bit into my sandwich I immediately realized I was supposed to doctor it up myself with mayo, or if it was there I just didn't taste it. The sandwich was good, just kinda bland. The tomato on it was fresh. I finished my fries and took in the view of the park across the street."}
{"text":"Cafe 1010 is one of the best kept secrets in the area --- I'll tell you about if you promise not to go blabbing to everyone. Deal?

Tucked away in the government building district, there's easy garage parking (free! shhh!) --- inside the Cafe is a grill that does everything from burgers to turkey reubens (Juan is a grill ninja master. Ask for crispy fries.) --- daily specials like fish & chips or baked ziti or taco salad or filet mignon (I may have made the last one up) --- I have not been here for breakfast but the regulars swear by the breakfast burrito.

Another pro tip: don't tell Emilio, the affable owner (and frequent cashier) --- but his prices are trapped in 1999. Very, very affordable. Convenience store prices. I also like, as a diet soda person, that the fountain drinks include Diet Coke (bah humbug!) but also Coke Zero (getting better) and Diet Dr. Pepper (is this aspartame heaven?) Plus there's coffee and iced tea and juice and --- 

OK, enough reading. Go to Cafe 1010. Don't tell your friends. Our little secret. Deal?"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for breakfast or lunch during the week!  Breakfasts are cheap and cooked to order!  My favorite is egg and cheese sandwich on a croissant!  They have daily lunch specials, but also a grill you can order anything you like from burgers to pastrami melts to grilled cheese to chicken fingers! 

However, the most popular item at Café 1010 is their Posole Soup - only served on Thursdays - year round!  THEY SELL OUT EARLY! Get there before Noon to get your soup!  $1.25 for a small cup and $2.25 for a bowl!  Get your Posole Soup with onion, cilantro and LEMON!  Yum!  

They also have a fresh and easy salad bar where you can build your own salad that they charge by the pound.  They also have breakfast and lunch punch cards!  

Parking is free right next door and above Café.  (The Café is on the first floor of a parking garage.)  Most of the customers are Arizona Dept. of Environmental Quality employees, since that state agency is right across courtyard from Café, but you will also see a lot of other customers there from all over!"}
