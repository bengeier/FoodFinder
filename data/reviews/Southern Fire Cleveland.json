{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant in Richmond Hts. a couple of weeks ago for the first time.  It was awesome!  The food was fantastic (good ol' down home taste) and the service was excellent too.  We asked to speak to the  chef so we could tell him how much we enjoyed everything.  He was very happy to hear that too.  I suggest if you had a not so great experience that you give them another chance.  It is not a fast food restaurant so expect your food to be well prepared just for you.  we will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered rib dinner take out, out of ribs. Ordered breaded pork chops in gravy with stuffing, black eyed peas. When I arrived, was told it would be a minute because pork chops were frozen( should have left then, but was hungry). Got home, peas and stuffing were very good but the pork chops were like cardboard and no gravy. Was disappointed and dinner was overpriced for what I got. Will not go back."}
{"text":"If I could give them less then this I would. So it's lunch time and on there menu and Facebook it says open from 8 to 10 or something like that and I called to place a lunch order for pickup at 1pm. The prep cook answers the phone & tells me that the cooks don't come in until 3 so I have to call back then. I only gave this place a 2nd chance because there are no other food places like this in the area smh."}
