{"text":"This bar is the Sunday home to Las Vegas fans of the Cleveland Browns.  That's appropriate because like the team and the city it represents, the Kopper Keg is absolutely dismal. (I say this as a native of Cleveland who escaped many years ago The stench of stale smoke permeates everything, including the \"non-smoking\" dining area.  The service is virtually non-existent, which almost doesn't matter becasue what they serve you may wish never made it to your table.
Sorry, but I can't think of a single redeeming thing about this run-dwon, filthy \"restaurant & lounge\".  Maybe they should add a river that catches on fire once in a while, just to complete the genuine Cleveland ambiance."}
{"text":"I love this place--I would be there all day and night if I didn't have a job.  While it looks like every other neighborhood bar from the outside, I have more fun at the Keg than any place else in Vegas.  The bartenders are sexy, funny and way beyond uncensored--everyone has a good time!!!  Daily food specials are always tasty and affordable--Saturday's (and Sunday when football is over) $1.99 breakfast special is truly the best deal in town."}
{"text":"We found this bar and grill across from our hotel on St. Rose Parkway. 

For a little neighborhood place the food is amazing. Homemade soups, wonderful steaks, chicken marsalla good enough to slap your mama for---forgive me mama, but you would agree. 

Service is usually really great, open to large parties and friendly. 

The dessert list could use a little work--and temping out the Snicker pie might not be a bad thing."}
{"text":"The woman bartending tonight was incredibly welcoming, even shared her nachos while I waiting for my food and tended to the other customers in a fashionable manner :) the cook there tonight did an awesome job on our order. Thanks for the great first impression guys, I will be coming back every so often to grab some dinner!"}
{"text":"I am visiting the Kopper Keg right now and had to come on and review it.  The bartender Shelly is absolutely amazing! She is funny and sweet and really knows how to take care of her customers.  You can just tell when someone really loves and cares about their job.  I truly believe her welcoming demeanor,  attentiveness,  and sweet/sassy personality is why most of the people come here.  It feels like family when you walk in! Loved this place... And will be a repeat customer!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers but the service and waitress were both horrible. It took over 50 minutes to get our food and the waitress kept saying it's because they're half pound burgers. Never had a more unfriendly waitress with the most negative, sour attitude. Unless you have a couple hours to kill, I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood bar! The staff is friendly, the food is delicious (ahi tuna bites and wings are a favorite), and their is a non-smoking side for those who aren't used to Vegas gaming bars (you're in Vegas, get over it). I've been coming here since I moved here, and I have never seen it dirty (per the person below's review). The bar is clean AND they actually have the cleanest women's bathroom I've ever seen in a bar). Yes, it's smoky, like every other bar in Vegas that offers gaming, but the company, bartenders, and food make up for it. If you're looking for your \"Cheers,\" a stiff drink or a yummy hangover meal, the Keg is where you need to be!"}
{"text":"Love the Cleveland vibe. Great football environment.  45 minute turn around time on food is a joke. Especially because it was wings, salads and sandwiches. We had to return the wings because of the old oil smell was overpowering."}
{"text":"Spent the day watching sports on one of their numerous big screen TVs. I decided on pizza for lunch, which was very good. I noticed other food which was being served and it looked wonderful as well. Food and drink specials are available too."}
{"text":"nice people , good food , one of my favorites to watch a game and play video poker"}
{"text":"Tried the basic cheeseburger tonight with a side of Onion Rings. Two things about the rings - waitress admitted that all side dishes were frozen and also there was a secret $1 upcharge for those frozen rings. That said, the waitress did give back that buck later after i mentioned it so that was nice. Burger was claiming to be fresh ground and tasted good, but BJ's has a better version in the local pub battle. Pricing point was good at $7.50, but beers are about a buck overpriced for being out in semi-boonies. Good TV's for all sports."}
{"text":"We been here twice, we always passed by and we decided to give it a try. Very nice staff. We get to order some food wich it was way much better than we imagine. We get to gamble and got a few drinks. Very chill spot to hang out if tou want to relax and space out from crowdy and noisy places. Lisa was our bartender and she make sure we enjoy our visit. We felt very welcome."}
{"text":"I go here late at night and have the $4 chicken wings special...... the cook makes it extra spicy for me, it gives me a real kick haha The late night bartender Wes is cool so come on in sometime and try out the wings or a pizza"}
{"text":"I can't say enough praise for this place. The food is great and the staff is OUTSTANDING!!! As I mentioned in my earlier review, this place truly is the \"Cheers\" of the area. I love the staff...both the bartenders and the chefs. I have a 4-legged son who doubles as my service dog; all the staff love him and treat him as they do all customers...like family. The people here truly go above and beyond all expectations. HIGHEST PRAISE AND KUDOS TO THE KEG!!!

The place has a pool table and juke box; just an all around good time to relax, enjoy some good food and drink, and have the best service in town."}
{"text":"This is a Browns bar but if your hungry don't go on a game day. It took over 2hrs to get a order of hot dogs. The waitress Sassy is not a good waitress at all, this crowd is over her head. They need more waitress or just have her do something else. Everyone is nice but the business part of it can be ran better"}
{"text":"Great staff and good prices for food and drinks. Food specials daily. I usually eat one if the specials but when I've eaten off the menu it always is a good deal. Lots of TVs showing whatever game is on and they are willing to change a channel if you need them too. Buckeyes/Browns bar to boot."}
{"text":"Running around with my buddy getting stuff for his Harley we dropped into this joint. Interesting it has the two door entry system bar side smoking and the non smoking side. 

The non smoking side is off to a bad start as the bar had an attractive friendly lady the non smoking side has the big quiet chef dude.

Now I have to say the place had boxing on the TV at 10am so I have to say nothing makes breakfast more entertaining like a good boxing match a golden boy production.

The food was just ok for the price which was extremely high for the quality and service (or lack there of). I highly doubt this is a place I will check back into unless I go into the bar where the bartender greet us coming and going. 

My advice this is a small local place and I would prefer to support these type of places but they need to step up there service to keep us. There were two tables us and the people who were done eating. No excuse for bad service!"}
{"text":"This place is great - and makes me feel like home. It is sort of like Cheers - everyone knows your name. But everyone is friendly to newcomers as well. I started coming here because it is a Cleveland Browns bar, but it has become my normal hangout as well. 

Video Poker Players, if you hit a 4 of a kind with max bet, they write it down on a card and take a picture. Once you hit 15 four of a kinds, you get an extra $100! Even if you don't come often, they will keep your card.  

The food is great, the beer is cold, and the staff is friendly and fun. What else can you want in a local bar!"}
{"text":"My home for Cleveland Browns football. I travel 17 miles every Sunday to come see my team. Incredibly friendly staff. Great food specials. Well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a no frills bar, this is the place to go. A dark dive bar with a pool table. Kopper Keg's happy hour is from 3 pm-7 pm which you can get a Miller lite for only $3.00! Their happy hour does not include any food items which is a bummer. However, if you want something to nibble on with the beer, I recommend the Chips and Homemade salsa for only $4.99. It was very good because the tortilla chips were served warm and the salsa was fresh."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm in Cleveland! I can't believe I've lived in Vegas for so long, and never been to this Browns backer bar! Only downfall (for me) is that it is a smoker friendly bar. The Skyline Chili during Browns Games only, is a huge plus, and a nice piece of \"home.\" Here we go Brownies, here we go!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch at 3pm on a Saturday with a friend. Laid back environment. Ordered a grilled cheese with onion rings. Was super tasty!"}
{"text":"I love a good cheeseburger, and The Kopper Keg has a juicy one! For $6.99 its a great value and super delicious.
The waitress 'Sassy' is really efficient and extremely attentive and friendly. 
Although, I dont care for football, we watched the game between CIN and PIT, was on all the tv's so couldn't help but watch this crazy game. and enjoy our dinner.

A definite must if you love a good burger with all the toppings and tasty french fries."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken philly sandwiches! Clean bar area and they have pool tables and couches to watch tv. A lot nicer on the inside than it looks from the outside! Staff was friendly and the food came pretty fast for 6 people and one cook at 12am."}
