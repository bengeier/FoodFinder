{"text":"Excellent lunch special.  It has a great old fashioned mom and pop restaurant feel to it.  The batter is nice and light.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fish and chips sounds so simplistic and boring but yet some how they manage to turn it around and create an explosion of flavor in your mouth. Fish and chips has to be my number one place to eat because you get so much food on your plate that taste so incredibly good and yet you don't go broke because of it. On top of the food tasting good the environment that you are surrounded by makes you feel like you are on the beach, you can tell the owner really likes? estaticly pleasing places, and every time I go there it is always clean no matter what, even if it's super busy they will always welcome you with open arms and will make sure that you get your good in less then 10min. I really appreciate their hard work that they put in order to maintain the place. And for that I gotta thank them"}
{"text":"Fish was excellent. Best I've had in Durham.  The chips were well over cooked though and far too thin.  If you're going to call it fish & chips, at least make proper chips with it.  Still, service was good and the atmosphere is nice enough."}
{"text":"I've been to a few fish and chip places in the Whitby area and this is probably my favourite.  The two of us usually split 2 haddock and 1 fries with coleslaw and that's plenty of food for us (and we're not small eaters!).    The haddock is excellent.  The batter is light and not greasy.  The fish itself is a thick whole side of haddock, which I greatly prefer over halibut.  It's nicely golden fried and no soggy bits!  The fries are fresh cut and they give you a whole platter for 1 order.  Coleslaw is just ok... too much liquid.    If you go late close to closing time, call ahead make sure they are still open.  They turned off the fryers early on us one time!  They have a parking lot on the side."}
{"text":"I think this is the best fish and chip restaurant in Aurora hands down. Portion sizes are good and not greasy either. Wil definitely be going back here again."}
{"text":"Yum! Hands down best F&C's in Brooklin. I have been here several times and always get great service and food. The place is always clean and friendly.  The batter is crispy and the fish is fresh! You have to try the greek salad!  The owner had made one too many and offered it to me while I was waiting for my order, I'm glad I took him up. Apparently they  make the dressing from scratch. A definate bonus."}
{"text":"Why was I in Whitby again? Oh yah, Easter! And what better way to spend good Friday then eating deliciously crisp, golden, battered fish and chips."}
{"text":"It's not the first time going here but it will be my last! .  Server ignored us for 5 minites so we seated ourselves and got ignored for another 5 minutes I understand why this place only has 2 customers on a  Saturday night.  Very unprofessional I am totally disappointed I've got better service at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Awesome place for fish  and chips, shrimp even onion rings!  Family owned and operated for the most part.... clean, hot fresh food served by friendly people.  Greatest place for fish and chips!!!"}
{"text":"Service was fast which is why I gave a ok review. It's been a year since I've had fish and chips . The fries were hand cut very good but they were soggy  and not well dobe as I asked . And the fish was greedy and not dobe enough and not lightly breaded as I asked for . I was very dissapointed and do not recommend them at all . I felt sick after ."}
{"text":"I really do like this place it's cheap and the food is pretty good! The early bird breakfast is the best value in town and the fish n chips are good, they arnt the best and they are very greasy, but they come in big portions!"}
{"text":"Well I've been coming here for about 4/12 years. Previous owner went back to china,so before he left he introduced me to the current owners. They are very polite, but they are hit & miss, depending on what day & time of day you purchase. I usually get halibut n chips,coleslaw & gravy. Today I'm very disappointed with the fries! They were overcooked almost as if they were fried before & got fried again. The fish size was about 8oz & thick but was fried too dry. This was a first since the new owners took over I have been disappointed  I won't be buying from here for awhile cause I was a regular. My dollars want to feel happy too. Coleslaw is the same good & creamy no changes to the formula but that's not the main reason to eat at a fish n chips place. Next time I'm going to Halibut house, the new kid in town which I tried 2 weeks ago & was liking it. That's another review tho!"}
{"text":"The local Aurorites said this was the best place in town OMG Where do they eat their fish and chips if this is the best place in town this is the worst fish and chips that I've ever eaten in my life warning to all stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Just went to Stanley's on August 1, 2013 and it was okay. The fish is very thin, but it's coated in a thick batter so it looks huge. I ordered my fish grilled and it was good, but it looked so small. The rest of my plate had a huge heaping pile of fries!   Overall it was okay food and I ate my fill. The people were friendly and kind and everyone in the kitchen waved goodbye when we left. It had a nice atmosphere. However, it was definitely not the best fish and chips around."}
{"text":"One of the best fish and chips I have been to. Portions are big!. And the place is very clean. Owner is very friendly and we found the service to be very good and friendly. It also has a liquor license.  I have been back many times despite the drive. One can sit down (plenty of seats compared to other fish and chips places) or you can takeout. Fridays is their busiest day."}
{"text":"Great casual fish and chip joint in downtown Brooklin. Our server was charming and prompt.   We both ordered the halibut dinner with chips, I got coleslaw and he upgraded to a Greek salad. We both really enjoyed our meals. The batter was light and not too oily.  We didn't get dessert but noticed that they had apple pie, ice cream and cheese cake. However the only dessert made in house was rice pudding (which I don't like).  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the second time we came here and both times we were very happy. Located in Brooklyn, a nice 30 minute drive east of Toronto. Being a fish and chips place, fish is the star on the menu but they also have a few other items if you don't want fish. I had the halibut plate which comes with fries and coleslaw. The batter was delicious, good thickness too. The fries were good and the coleslaw creamy.   They also have senior portions which are smaller. The price was fair for what we got. The waitress was very friendly and the cook (owner?) also came to see how everything was. Worth the drive to go back."}
{"text":"Very friendly owners. Great portions. More chips then one person needs.  The fish is very flaky and batter is crispy. My only complaint is they charge for tarter sauce and coldslaw"}
