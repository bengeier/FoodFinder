{"text":"This wine bar is adorable!  I agree with some of the other reviews that have said the sewing tables are a bit uncomfortable/impractical but with a group of 4 or 5 people, you can make it work.  Prices are reasonable.  Wine is yummy :) We also had the cheese platter and some desserts.  All good but small portions.  Great selection of boardgames from the 80s (family feud!) even though Operation seemed to be missing most of the pieces. The sewing tables are full of post-its with random messages.  A fun place to spend an evening."}
{"text":"I have never been to a bar quite like this before.  It felt like being in a girly-girl's house with damask print on the walls (even the front door of the place...which was good because it's otherwise hard to find) and antique Singer sewing machines for tables.    Super eclectic musical selections also made for a good night.  Young MC's Funky Cold Medina was playing when I got there, which made for a rather interesting juxtaposition with  the crystal chandeliers and pink accents.  Later on I recall hearing Ben Folds Five and The Beatles.  Then there are all the board games!  It's almost like the bar doesn't know quite what it wants to be...but somehow that all equals a very charming place.  We had already eaten dinner, so the desserts were of interest and they all sounded delicious.  I shared the sticky toffee pudding with ice cream from Ed's Real Scoop.  It was excellent.  Others had the cranberry cheesecake which apparently was also lovely but one wasn't a fan of the walnuts in the cookie base.  Swirl is a really fun spot for a night playing board games and drinking from their extensive wine list.  If you're in the east end, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Swirl is this impossibly perfect wine bar. First, its a bit hard to find, and when you get there, you immediately kind of feel like you've walked into someones apartment and crashed the party.   But then you realize that may be the point. the list is ever changing, and the last time I was there, all the food came in jars. delightful. its impossibly small, so i would recommend it being a group night out, but if its just the two of you, and you feel like an amazing intimate experience, well shucks, you may just love it."}
{"text":"Amazing owners, relaxed no fuss atmosphere and always a highlight to my night when near by. Don't forget to write a note and drop it into the drawers at the tables."}
{"text":"I love Swirl wine bar! It's warm and inviting and when you're inside enjoying a drink you feel as though you are part of a great little Toronto secret. The bar is not big by any means but it is cozy. I have always had great wine and the cheese platter is perfect for sharing! Reading other poster's reviews I must say I had no idea the bar had board games but I will look for those next time I'm there! A great place for a glass of wine amongst friends!"}
{"text":"Swirl is adorable. Teeny, tiny, cupboard like, patrons sit on reclaimed benches with either old doors or antique sewing machine tables. Your wine comes care of the very quiet and friendly server in a little clay carafe. Very dark and quiet with candles.   There are about 6 tables in a space the size of an average dining room, so note you can hear every conversation word-for-word, and you will be very close to your neighbors.  On last visit we had a late 40s couple (clearly first date or newly dating) on one side, a pair of hipsters playing Operation on the other, a solo woman reading a book by candlelight and three luluemon clad women catching up. Very eclectic crowd.  There is a larger room with one large table in the back, which would be perfect for a group, complete with board games.   You won't find any bargains here, for sure, but a carafe of wine (1/2 L)was around $20. We did not sample any food, but it is all brought in.    Swirl is very unique, which lends to its charm. Very charming,  It feels like a tiny wine bar in Barcelona. More for a romantic date, quiet drinks with girlfriends. Definitely a place to go and relax quietly if you cannot do so at home, and \"unplug\"   Will definitely return, but a little too calm/quiet/tight to be my neighborhood go-to."}
{"text":"Very quaint and old charm atmosphere is the setting for this very nice wine bar in Leslieville. A small but nice wine selection very reasonably priced. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Cute upstairs locale on Queen Street East. If you are looking for a cozy place to chat with a friend or a few, this is it. They have a tiny menu of pots- you'll see what I mean if you go. There are 'pots' of pate, cheese spread and meat. The wine list is great, but the mixed drinks are also fantastic.  Put a wish in the drawer as you leave. Read all the other people's wishes when you walk in.  Quite music- so if it is dead, make nice with the owners since you feel like you are in their kitchen."}
{"text":"I had been dying to check this place out because I looooove wine.  The wine list is extensive and has some very tasty options, and best of all, is very reasonably priced. As others have mentioned, there are very limited options other than wine. There are, however, tons of board games!  I'd noticed that some of the reviews say that this place is really girly, and I wondered what that could mean. Well, I found out. This place is like Zooey Deschanel come to life. Don't get me wrong, I love girly things, but maybe not on a Saturday night when I am dressed up to go out!   I'd definitely like to come back another time to take them up on one of their many weeknight specials."}
{"text":"This place is a  well kept Toronto secret and I am about to spill the beans :) It's a beautiful wine bar on the second floor and the decor is wonderfully eclectic. My friends and I were celebrating a birthday and we were given a little room all to ourselves. We went through several delicious bottles of wine and they are quiet reasonably priced - my fave being the Cave Springs Reisling. It's a great place for a date night or a small group of friends to enjoy a delicious bottle of wine."}
{"text":"A charming, quirky, and unique place with friendly service, reasonable prices, and a pleasant ambiance make Swirl a place that I will definitely visit again.  The atmosphere strikes the correct balance between visiting someone's home and actually going to a restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"ONCE you find it, you'll become a regular like I did! Great wine list and jarred bites. Funky decor with cozy atmosphere. Themed nights a lot of fun too."}
{"text":"Swirl does everything right!  The wine selection is impressive...and the food (served \"potted\" in mason jars, and \"ploughman\" style on wooden boards) is always delicious.  There is something so wonderful about the atmosphere, from the artwork to the lighting to the converted-sewing-machine tables.  If you want to impress your date with your knowledge of hidden Toronto gems, bring them here!"}
{"text":"The door was hard to find and the scribble as a sign was barely legible as text, but find it I did.  Felt kind've sheepish when I asked our hostess \"what's the concept behind this restaurant?\" and got a curt \"well first of all, we're a wine bar and not a restaurant\".  =(  Guess I should've known better.  Anyways, I really liked the place.  It was a little awkward cuz there was no one else there, and the proprietor was 10 feet away from us reading her book fully within earshot of our entire conversation.  With more people and with a conversation buzz, I can see this being a really relaxed place to hang out with friends and drink a couple jugs of wine.  Only problem is that it's way the hell out on Queen E where I don't normally venture to.  Segue.  I loved the decor, and although the tables were a little awkward to fit everything we ordered on, I can appreciate that they're trying to do something different.  The notes in the desks were a cute little bonus.  Bread was nice, although I wish they warmed it up a little bit.  Charcuterie board was fun and the pate was delicious.  Pretty much everything we ordered was fun to eat, and mixing and matching flavours was enjoyable.  If this place was in a more common location, it'd be a massive hit for sure, but being so far away,  I can't see it being any more than a diamond in the rough.  Maybe it's better that way?  Go decide for yourself."}
{"text":"WARNING - NOT DINNER.  Made the mistake going in hungry, it's definitely a wine bar.  Surprise!  When I was introduced to this place, all the food were in jars, I said, \"sweet!  mason jars with delicious soup and stews\" - WRONG.  The jars are little and comes from the fridge, there is no kitchen there.  We got the CHICKEN LIVER PATE - this was probably my favourite thing on the menu - the taste after you let it thaw a bit was actually quite tasty, but I do like pate in general.    We got something LEMON TUNA-esque.  It tasted like canned tuna and fat in a jar.  This wasn't my favourite.  The waitress recommended a pairing with WHITE BEANS, it tasted better with it but it was canned tuna.  The CHARCUTERIE AND CHEESE PLATE - was good, it had nice pairings but I wasn't bedazzled by it.  Love the decor, the romantic sewing tables and doors as tables are the perfect setting for a date - if you want to eat very little.  It is hard to find but it's the perfect place for drinking.  The pink accents of this wine bar, were sweet, but seemed like a place where girlfriends got together, so the messages are very conflicting for a romantic date.  Overall, wasn't my fav. experience, probably because I was really hungry.  Go for a drink, not for dinner."}
{"text":"What a fantastic gem! Swirl is what I like to think of as Black Hoof lite with its meat, cheese and bread offerings and it's well thought out wine list.   Came here last night on the trusted word of my fellow Yelper Christine with whom I enjoyed a fantastic bottle of wine along with some excellent nibbles. We shared a cheese and charcuterie plate and a chicken liver pate which was served in a cute preserve jar. I very much enjoyed the charcuterie on offer though it was a little stingy compared to the small charcuterie board I'm used to at the Black Hoof. The chicken pate was a knockout, smooth and rich in flavour. Looking forward to future visits, the menu had cretons (yum!) and marinated goat cheese (intriguing).   Wine list is very reasonable, our bottle wine was the cheapest one on the list but it delivered the goods all the same. Our server was friendly and attentive and we had a wonderful time chatting with the awesome soundtrack of hip hop, pop and blues in the background.   Swirl is a small pleasant space that is well suited for relaxing to good food and drink."}
{"text":"A friend who lived in the area took me here one evening; not being from the area I never would have found this gem in a million years!  The space is, to say the least, charming. It's the converted upstairs of a storefront that's carved up into one back room and then a main room, looking out over the quiet street below. Decor is classic, yet modern with  old desks and doors re-appropriated into tables. Oh, as an added bonus you can write wishes on post it notes and leave them in the table drawers.  A nicely thought-out menu offers a variety of wines by the glass (as well as a basic selection of beer and cocktails) and small plates. Since we had just popped in for a glass of wine and something small to eat, we got the seasoned olives. Let me say this: I dislike olives but these were darned tasty. I wish I'd been able to try more of their offerings!"}
{"text":"There is something so much more satisfying about finding a place that's hard to find. Bad signage and hidden entries make you feel more \"in-the-know\". I walked right past Swirl without noticing the odd apartment entry amidst the storefronts on Queen street when I heard my boyfriend behind me say, \"the stairs on this place look completely up your alley\". He was right.   We walked right up the damask print stairs into the cutest little converted bar above a pet shop. The wine list is well curated and reasonably priced, with amazing appetizers served in mason jars (all made ahead, this place has no kitchen) and great cheese plates direct from the Leslieville Cheese Market. The friendly service and interesting liqueurs (chamomile grappa, pomegranate tequila) ensured that I'll come back again. Perfect date spot."}
{"text":"Swirl Wine Bar is a relatively new entrant into the neighbourhood.  Swirl has a quaint and charming feel partly due to being located at a top floor of a building, hidden away from the rest of the world - perfect for a romantic escape from the busy sidewalks down below for you and your date.  Dimly lit with the added ambiance of candlelight, their sommelier has carefully chosen a wine menu for those who have the most discerning palate.  Their menu features various charcuterie and fresh breads to accompany your wine.  Swirl Wine Bar is truly is a \"hidden\" gem in Leslieville."}
{"text":"My bf and I were looking for a intimate place for a glass of wine and found Swirl. I didn't give it a fair chance since we only had wine there. The speciality pates and riettes are suppose to be nice. The place was cute place, especially for a girls night out. The benches and tables were a bit uncomfortable for me. I would return but with a ff instead. I recommend this place for chicks looking for a quiet place to catch up."}
{"text":"Much has been made of Swirl and it's  inspired decor done on the cheap as well as it's Being John Malkovich-esque \"1/2\" address. Don't get me wrong, it's  cute and twee. With sewing machine stands for tables, drawers filled with customer's wishes, It's tweer than a unicorn's dick. But the menu and wine selection are all about sophistication.   The charcuterie board and pates are amazing. The bread is nice and rustic. And... how can you say no to creme caramel?   I have a new favourite wine thanks to the wonderful hostess/owner Janean! Montepulciano d'Abruzzo!   Perfect as an evening capper to Nuit Blanche or what have you. Also..takeaway jars!"}
{"text":"Swirl is an intimate, casual and eclectic wine bar.  The setting is sort of like a funky apartment and the food is served in jars."}
{"text":"Made a second trip back to Swirl, this time with my winger & fellow Yelper Deanna in tow.  I still love this place and in my opinion its a really cool hidden gem.  We slurped back a bottle of Italian table wine which was only $23 and all things considered it was very decent.  The chicken pate is still ab fab.  The gal who makes all the goodies in the jar is the head chef at Brasserie (like she isn't busy enough!). The quality is stellar.    My only gripe with Swirl is that there were a couple of things on the tiny menu that weren't available (duck rillettes & herbed goat cheese).  Deanna and I noshed on a cheese & charcuterie board that had four different cheeses & four different meats, all really delicious.  My only suggestion would be for Swirl to add a savory to this board, such as olives or a small splatter of some sort of tapenade.  Loved the little bowl of nuts the waitress brought over as we were finishing up or board.  Service was comfy/casual.    I'll be back.  I'm feeling the love for Swirl.  Oh yeah, great tunes....gotta love that early Etta James!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little bar, with a nice atmosphere and a reasonable wine list.  The server we had was great...I hate to say it again, but this is another neighbourhood gem - located above my pups fave dog store, this is a great place to visit!"}
{"text":"Cutest Wine Bar Ever! This little door that is painted with a damask pattern leads up a stairway into this warm and cozy area full of eclectic artwork and interior design. Large murals on canvas and funky artwork with detailed framing surround the room. For tables, old sewing machines that have been stained and brushed with colour.   We didn't order any food, but there is a good variety of snacks to munch on.. including assorted nuts (caught my eye) - includes everything EXCEPT peanuts. I wonder why?  Menus are screwd into a wood plank (very creative and rustic) and there is a good selection of wine. Wines come in Jars, Jugs or bottles. My friend and I ordered a Jar or Chilean Syrah, which equals to about 1/2 a litre for $22. The wine was fruitful and full bodied. The smell of berries was very prominent. I was quite pleased! We each got two glasses out of the jug which I thought was a great deal!  Little would you know that you would find boardgames in this place - the table beside us was playing battleship.... would be something I do on my next visit! Another surprise was inside the sewing machine drawers contains colourful post-it notes... of people's wishes and secrets to be shared with others. It reminded me of the post-secret website where thoughts are always posted anonymously. What a way to top my night off.  I was expecting this place to be extremely chilly - as it is in an older building, but the interior was very well insulated and I never felt cold, even sitting beside the window. Just before midnight, a crowd of 10 showed up and things got very lively. The music was great and I know on other nights, they play shows like mad men.  This place is such a gem. I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The food and wine are OK, but nothing special.  It is overpriced.  You are paying for the décor (admittedly quirky and cute) and the novelty value of the +1/2 address.  If that's OK with you, by all means check it out.  Otherwise, there have to be places that offer better value."}
{"text":"How cute is this Leslieville wine bar? The sign is small and it's up a narrow flight of stairs. I wouldn't have noticed it, but had heard good things from Yelpers (thanks guys!) so the sign caught my eye. Came on a weekend after dinner and the main room was occupied for a birthday party (and I secretly thought \"how did *I* not think to have my b-day here?\"... what a sweet, intimate venue for a gathering of friends!). So we sat in the little back room through the French doors. Mismatched furniture, eclectic music choices (\"Thriller\" anyone?), board games, cookbooks... it's like being in someone's home. The room was hot, but the rotating fan helped. So did the perfectly sweet, fruity white sangria ($16/jar, which is about 3 glasses) with pear and mangoes. DC and I also shared the chocolate cake, our server's suggestion (he said they are \"famous\" for it). Like all the food items, it came in a little jar and was covered in a thick layer of creamy marscapone cheese. Our raspy-voiced, Beatles t-shirt-wearing server was convivial. Nice added touch -- the bill comes in a used book and instead of cheap mints, you get a little envelope with tea from nearby Majesteas (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/majesteas-toronto). We got the \"Wrath of Grapes\" blend - an organic green rooibos with lemon, ginger, and peppermint. I'm actually drinking it at home *right now*! Like.    Look out for their weekly events: Sundays - movie night Mondays - book swap Tuesdays - board games and 1/2 price beer Wednesdays - Mad Men night"}
{"text":"Went to Swirl with 3 friends last week on a Thursday, and it was a great experience. Certainly a change from our usual wings night. Time flew by as we enjoyed drinks and most items on the menu while chatting away in this very relaxed atmosphere. The decor is eclectic, which adds to the charm. Everything about Swirl is unconventional yet it works so well. They have theme nights!! It got busy around 9pm, and I couldn't help wonder how someone would find out about this place as it is almost impossible to notice from outside unless one is looking for it. I suppose it must be word of mouth. I will surely continue to Swirl!"}
{"text":"Really great choice of wines. Lovely reserved yet quirky decor. Lots of nice dishes. Charcuterie and cheese plate. Rhubarb ginger confit. Nice eclectic music playlist. Great staff. Had a great birthday in the party room. Been back ever since...A real shame it closed."}
{"text":"This... is a pretty awesome little place. Neat concept, well executed.  Came here for my girlfriend's birthday, because she has been really into the idea of this place for a while but we haven't made it out to Leslieville to try it.  We tried: - cretons (with horseradish mustard) - stilton with caramelized apple - pickled mushrooms - pickled quail eggs - creme caramel - chocolate cake with mascarpone ice cream  All were excellent. And the bread was good. This place is wildly satisfying because you get to slather cheese and meat onto bread in a way you never would at home. The quail eggs and pickled mushrooms tasted very similar, but were both great, and both came with equally tasty pickled garlic. The mushrooms also came with onions ... fantastic with the cretons. And speaking of which, where else can you get cretons? Mmmm. I didn't think I would like it but really did. Think tourtière as a spread, topped by a layer of fat.   Creme caramel is a bit odd out of the jar, since instead of the usual sauce-on-custard configuration you dig through custard to get to a rather thick layer of sugar soup. But still delicious. Chocolate cake was your usual chocolate cake, but the scoop of mascarpone icing on the side was fantastic.  Just drank the house white, at $13 a jug it's what a table wine should be.  Try this place!  If you sit at one of the sewing tables, there are pencils and post-it notes in a secret little spot. You can write down your wishes and put them in one of the drawers. For the wish fairies."}
{"text":"Liked didn't love.   A few things soured my first trip to Swirl. First off we couldn't go upstairs, I guess my bud and I arrived too late and so we had to sit on the lower level. Unless I'm mistaken I didn't see anything online about that upstairs dining area closing early, but I've been wrong before... shocking, I know! This is going to sound super silly, but the lighting downstairs blows. It's bright, harsh and made for a super uncomfortable experience. Couple that with the fact that some of the only seats left were near the drafty door, it was sort of rough all around before our server came over. (Am I 80 right now?) He was ok, a little awkward, but pretty informative. My friend Chad and I settled on some small plates and vino, none of which was terribly impressive. I'll be the first to say that the things leading up to our orders arriving didn't really set the tone for success, but I am more than willing to go back and give these guys another try. Carrot cake for dessert was probably the best part of our adventure. Different than most I've had in that it was quite cake-y, light and not as dense as traditional CC.   This just in though. There's a \"Swirl Sangria\" flavour at Ed's which I'm a huge fan of! Locals supporting locals... brings a yelpy tear to my eye!"}
{"text":"Came to this place about a year ago on a whim. I was walking down Queen St. East grabbing groceries but I happened to pass a sign that was in front of a small door that led to stairs. If it were not for the sign I would've easily missed this place.   So what is Swirl?  Well!!! It is similar to Snakes and Lattes, but offers a completely different approach to games night. Swirl is the combination of board games and wine and tasting. They offer many wine and many other pairings. I had a great night playing games and it was very romantic. I thought it was very cute that in the drawers of the tables there are little post it notes inside with wishes or comments. Also, their desserts were amazing! Everything from the ambience and the food were great.   However, the biggest problem I had with the place is that it was difficult to find and the pricing were a lot more expensive then I thought they should have been. The cheese that we ordered came from the Leslieville Cheese Market and for our measly amount that were ordered I just did not agree. I am a regular shopper at the Leslieville Cheese Market and I am well aware of the costs of many of their products. So I just thought that I should've just stayed home with my own games and bought my own cheese and wine.   Overall, it is a great place, but for those who are money conscious avoid and have a fun night in!   - CL"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be playing CLUE on top of a sewing machine table on a Saturday evening, but Swirl made it possible.  I suggest you give this place a pass if you are not a wine drinker. Other options were very limited but there is a handmade pink wine menu with lots of selection. They did not have anything non-alcoholic and I believe they only had two choices for beer.  It was HOT here...it's the upstairs area of a house and there is no air conditioning. I don't think a/c is very hipster, because I've noticed none of the hipster bars have it.  Anyway, the place was done up in a very unique artsy fashion, very fairytale-ish. The bathroom was SO cool as was the back room.  The bar tables are refurbished antique sewing machine tables.   There was a selection of board games to play (Clue, Trivial Pursuit 1980s edition, Operation and some others).  Seems like a good place for a quiet night out with the girls."}
{"text":"The last thing I thought was playing CLUE with some other Yelpers on a Saturday night.   Swirl is a nice place to hang with a couple of friends, maybe a little to feminine for some but great to have different bars and loungers that have different vibes.   Good selections of wine but for beer drinkers it will be really disappointing to just have 1 and only 1 choice... but then for me, no need to make decision?   Daydreaming while my friends were asking me questions about who killed with what and where definitely not me call relaxing :)"}
{"text":"First off they were playing D'angelo as I walked in - amazing!!!   This spot is cozy, intimate and overall seems like a classy joint. The wine menu ranges from affordable to splurgeworthy! These are all positives in my mind but ...   I went on a Friday night and it was quite full. Some people may find the furniture  \"cool\" or \"vintage\" but I found it rather impractical. It's all re-purposed stuff (like a door or a vanity) that has been made into \"tables\". With less people this may have been nice but with a fairly full house I just felt cramped and I'm not big dude.  Would I go back?  Probably if I was with a group that chose to go here but this is far from the top list of venues."}
