{"text":"The basil chicken is the best I've ever had In Pittsburgh! They also have fabulous sushi too!!!"}
{"text":"I hated this food and this experience.  The staff was rude.  The atmosphere is ambiguous --- large screen t.v.s as if it aspires to be a sports bar, but otherwise any chinese restaurant usa - from the 1970's.  The food was ridiculously salty, defying the owners' claim of \"no msg.\"  The sauces were unnecessarily thick --- have they not figured out that Americans have moved far beyond old-style gelatinous Asian cuisine, and on to fresher food?  I would never recommend this restaurant and I will never return to it.  And --- did I mention that the staff was rude?!  Bleh."}
{"text":"The Chinese food and sushi always tastes amazing but I do have a few complaints about the staff. The lady who usually answers the phone to do delivery calls is very rude and makes me not want to order from them. The other lady who delivers the food is VERY strange but she means well. Sometimes she iss on the phone, speaking in Chinese to somebody, and will hand me the food and the check to sign and then just walk away without even saying thank you or having any type of conversation. The staff needs major improvements. The food has always been good and their lunch special is the perfect size! The sushi is always fresh and well made."}
{"text":"Tai Pei is a pillar of the restaurant community.  There are so many memories here of enjoying quality food and sharing many laughs!  The dishes bring us back for more but Michael and Lencho keep us there longer."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. I've frequented the restaurant many times for sushi, noodles, rice, and plenty of their other dishes. The atmosphere is also great and the service is very friendly. I would definitely recommend Taipei if you're craving Chinese and sushi."}
{"text":"This is an average Chinese restaurant and don't let anyone tell otherwise. We ordered three different dishes which came out looking the same and worse, tasting the same. But the place ok for a one time trial. The waiter barked back his responses but I think my kids spoke softly so I let it slide. The worst part are the prices. Never have I paid $2.5/ one oily spring roll tasting below average or $2.5 for a Pepsi! are you kidding me. Then rice noodles with three pieces of chicken for $14, chicken mixed veg fro $14? I pay $6 on campus and it tastes better. These prices are not for this restaurant. I have eaten Chinese elsewhere and paid more but my plate was way superior than Tai Pei's. I would recommend it only if you have no choice."}
{"text":"Honestly, every aspect (besides our weird waiter) was great.  My food tasted very fresh, and even though the server was a bit awkward and strange, he was very attentive.  It's the best Chinese food I've had in ages."}
{"text":"Most dishes on the menu are American style Chinese food. Not a bad choice if you just want to have a quick bite at lunch time. I felt that the food there is a little pricier than it should be. Aside from these I do recommend their basil chicken, which is a traditional Taiwanese dish."}
{"text":"I guesses I've succumbed to the groupon curse, as I regularly get take out from this place and am usually pleased. The restaurant has taken a dive, too, in regard to quality of food, quantity of meat vs. veggie ratio in dishes. They are cheaping out because they can afford to. The 15238 zipcode ensures their continued success because wealthy SAHMs will be going to their private pilates class and leave the nanny with 80$ to get Chinese delivered. Everything is a la carte. I'm not sure its all made in-house anymore. Since new management several years ago, the food quality has drastically decreased and the MSG levels have increased. Miso soup is MSG soup with a tofu amount comparable to a baby aspirin. You may get two wontons in your quart of soup if you are lucky. General tsos, cheap chicken parts, incredibly spongy texture. Moo shu has plenty of cabbage, hardly any meat. The sushi is okay, but I've had some really salty fish, which makes me think its got some kind of preservative added on. We dined in recently, ordered GT and MSP, used my 15 for 30 groupon and still owed 15 for two Cokes and the tip... portions were small (I chalk this up to using the groupon)."}
{"text":"Please don't go here. I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .

I think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.

The service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my food off. No \"how's it going\", no water refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink. 

The portions are extremely small - I've never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.

The atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.

The waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?

Other reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.

Jews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're \"busy\", can you imagine what it'll be like on Christmas?

The slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurant?

Only go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist."}
{"text":"Has the won ton soup and the amazing chicken. The wonton was tasty but needed some vegetables.  I ordered the amazing chicken and added vegetables - they weren't generous with the veggies.  Tasty food.  But would do better with a little note attention. I would give it another star if they fixed these things.  I did like the ambience - casual but quaintly decorates.

Five minutes after I posted this - they came over and offered me more vegetables.  Great service! It's wonderful to have a great restaurant that cares about their customers.  Also - the amazing chicken was amazing."}
{"text":"This is the worst chinese food I've ever had in pittsburgh. Honestly, it's probably the worst I've ever had. Ordered delivery and the food came hot and the prices are a lot higher than other places. I expected at least decent and I was extremely disappointed. This place barely uses any flavor other than salt and msg. The meat is low quality... Ugh there's just nothing good to say about this place. It was terrible and I heard that this place was shut down temporarily because of some complaints about food poisoning. Unfortunately I heard after I ordered. I implore people to try somewhere else. This place is nearly inedible."}
{"text":"I was a regular at Taipei for about seven years before moving out of the area (about 20 minutes away, but far enough where I only eat here now occasionally). 

I have to say that having partaken of lots of
Chinese food in the north hills, east end, and downtown, Taipei beats everything. The consistently great flavor of all the dishes is really remarkable. We just grabbed take-out here again and it was superb.

Our go-to's are usually the hot and sour soup (best in Pittsburgh-- with lots of tofu and pork and good texture and spice); pork dumplings; and lo mein. 

We also have for years gotten their sesame chicken, which is really unusual. We like to call it \"donut chicken\"-- it has light breading and sweet and vinegary sauce. It's the best thing we've gotten there.

I've had their sushi in the past and it was very good too, especially their nigiri.

Overall, I'm glad to see Taipei maintain excellent quality for a number of years. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered General Tso's shrimp and an egg roll for delivery as a hungry nurse on Mothers Day at the VA hospital May 8th. Delivery was fast but the food was TERRIBLE! I couldn't even eat it, the shrimp tasted super fishy as if it were rotten. The egg roll was soggy and cold. I ended up eating only the rice.  Also, VERY EXPENSIVE! Total for the above was $24! Beware of the delivery guy who will try to scam you for a bigger tip! I gave him $30 for the $24 order and asked for $2 back (which would give him a generous $4 tip in addition to the $2 \"deliver fee\"). He claimed he didn't have any one dollar bills. (Dude, you have ONE JOB! Hand me my order and cash me out!) Rather than stiff him, I gave him the entire $30 to keep...so my inedible meal cost $22 with an $8 tip! No one on my nursing unit will be eating from this place again, I threw out the menu and wrote a warning about this dive for the entire hospital to read. I just hope the bite of rotten shellfish I did eat doesn't make a return appearance later this evening!"}
{"text":"Food is adequate but service leaves something to be desired. Had a reservation for 14 people made well in advance and when we arrived on time no arrangements had been made by staff. After a lengthy wait we ended up sitting at separate tables. No quality checks performed by our server or management and our server was unable to answer very basic questions about the Japanese beers bring offered. When your beer list consists of less than 10 beers, you should know what your selling."}
{"text":"Got chicken with string beans ($16.00) take-out.  The chicken was slimy and not many pieces at that.  The slimy pieces of chicken were of the quality served at most mall \"asian\" fast food places.  Most of the pieces present were small like nuggets.  The \"string beans\" were in fact GREEN BEANS!  I do know the difference.  This dish was smothered in sauce and had no flavor.

This place has been going steadily downhill for the past 5 years or so.  I will not order anything from this place ever again.  Go to Sesame Inn in North Hills and other locations.  At least they are consistently good."}
{"text":"The best place in town for Asian cuisine & sushi. A little nicer than typical sushi places. A must place for me to eat when I'm home from college."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants by far. The staff is great and always welcoming. The food is delicious and there is a variety to try from. The atmosphere is phenomenal and great for large parties. My family and I have been there several times and never have had a bad experience. We've celebrated Birthdays and graduation and just have had family get togethers. Always looking forward to going back. Great quality in sushi and food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Consistently wonderful food and service. We have been going to Tai Pei for  almost 20 years and in that time have only had one less than fantastic dish. Would recommend it highly for  anyone who want great Chinese food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Try the chicken and broccoli yummy and try the green tea ice cream so super I love this place the food the atmosphere everything"}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite Chinese Restaurant in the Pgh area. Food is consistently very good - General Tso's is tender, not the shoe leather I sometimes get at other places. Steamed dumplings, wonton soup, lo-mein, all terrific."}
{"text":"service here was awesome. my date and I tried a little bit of everything. maki rolls were good and my nigiri was well executed. not the best sushi I've had in my life but definitely satisfying. the beauty here is the mix of Chinese and Japanese on the menu. take advantage of the diversity and order a few different things that you and your company can split."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer and defender of Tai Pei restaurant (against the Jimmy Wan's converts- though I also enjoy Jimmy Wan's). Unfortunately, I must agree with Danielle P that the past few years I've seen a slow but substantial decline in quality. There always seems to be multiple managers on duty, which makes me wonder how there is such a lapse in quality control. 

Selection: They have the usual American-Chinese restaurant fare plus sushi. It's a slightly more diverse selection with entrees like Chilean Sea Bass and daily specials.

Ordering: For the first time today, I used GrubHub to place my delivery lunch order online. I enjoyed this convenience. In the past, phone orders have also been pleasant and we've never had an order mix-up.

Delivery: Delivery times are consistently speedy. They always beat their estimate. Delivery drivers are friendly and bring the food in to our front desk instead of waiting inthe lot for us to come out as some drivers do.

Food: This is where the trouble starts. In general, the food has become much too greasy. Writing this 20 minutes after eating I can still feel the grease on my lips and there is a little oil on my keyboard, I confess! The Wonton soup is dark brown and way too salty (and I'm a salt addict) with nothing but broth and 2 wontons that are obviously not made in house. 

Today I had the shredded pork with garlic sauce (lunch portion). It was a disaster. Besides the heavy oil content, it was also bland despite it being a 'spicy' offering. The worst part was the ratio of meat to water chestnuts. Probably 30% meat to 70% water chestnuts. Not kidding. maybe even 80/20. I am uploading a photo as proof. This is clearly a way to cut back on the amount of meat that they give you and I feel completely ripped off."}
{"text":"We visited with a Groupon last Thursday. 

We ordered the Hot and Sour Seafood Soup, the black bean chicken, szechuan beef, and lamb with scallions. 

The soup was awesome! Very spicy!

The rest of the food was awful. It was tasteless... the meat had a weird fluffy texture.... there was zero flavor. It was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager. 

He said the kitchen would make new dishes. 

They brought three new entrees. They were again completely flavorless, but warmer. I couldn't taste salt or pepper  or garlic or even feel any heat. It was awful. 

We paid and left. 

yuck. 

I used to go here as a child. I remember the sushi was always good. Maybe that is the thing to order!"}
{"text":"We order a lot because my daughter loves it but the last two deliveries that I have received have reeked of cigarette smoke!  It saturates the food.  I told them about it last time and they seem not to care.  I cannot be the only one who noticed or complains about this issue and they are not fixing the problem.  I'll stick to strictly pick-up from this point forward.  The food when not smoke filled is good."}
{"text":"I loved the Hokkaido Roll it just melts in your mouth.  The spicy tuna pizza was very good too but I did not think it was spicy.  I would definitely order both again."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent.  I enjoy their sushi and know when I get a chicken dish I don't have to guess if it is eatable always good white meat.   I typically do take out and it is well worth the drive"}
{"text":"Okay, so I had to come back on here and give them some kudos. I ordered lo mein here for my daughter to nosh on while I had some sushi and her dish was really good. My sushi was fresh and very tasty. While I'll probably stick to the sushi and my daughter will probably stick to her noodles...I'm a happy camper. It's also very convenient to work and I'm always met with a smile.

See, I'm not hard to please!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I searched forever to find a good Chinese place since I moved to Pittsburgh and I'm so glad I found TaiPei! I frequently get delivery from here after work when I'm feeling lazy and their General Tso's and Ta-Chien chicken are the best!"}
{"text":"steamed dumplings very bland and hard,, my eggplant was way burnt and sauce flavorless,, I asked for medium spicy it was more a 1  43$ and food was not as expected  wouldve complained but whats the point"}
{"text":"This place is just not what it used to be.  I would have given it close to 4 starts about 5 years ago, but not it is just a subpar Chinese restaurant.  Food is just meh....from the Hot and Sour soup to the General Tso's."}
{"text":"I'm very particular about Asian food. Let me emphasize very one more time. Very.

I usually have poor experiences, but I was pleasantly surprised with Tai Pei. Both times I dined there, I was greeted, which seems to be a lost art these days, and seated immediately. My waiter was just around the corner and greeted me with water. Both times I ordered sushi, I was able to see it being prepared, which is always a plus. My waiter was quick and served me as soon as the sushi was ready. The second time I went, I ordered sushi and an entree. The service was good but took a while for my main dish to be served. I only mention this since the restaurant wasn't packed.

Still, the food was wonderfully prepared. I consider Tai Pei one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly service and a wide range of menu items available. I generally stick to the Chinese food but have heard good things about the sushi bar."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here since moving to the area. At first I was a bit annoyed at the lunch prices and it only worsened when I realized the choice was soup OR egg roll, not choice of soup AND egg roll. Ended up not mattering as the hot and sour soup was the best I've had in years. Then when my orange chicken was served I was dold. The sauce was sweet, hot and thick. The chicken crispy and plentiful my only complaint about the good was the fried rice was a bit dry. I'll go back."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try the food here but unfortunately when I called to order the employee was rude right off the bat. When I asked about their vegan options, because the online menu didn't offer descriptions, I was told to look at the vegetarian section. I asked, but is that vegan too? They told me they had rolls and tofu. That's it."}
{"text":"The sushi here is incredibly fresh and super delicious.  

First of all it's a lot bigger inside than it looks from the outside and tables/booths are comfortably spaced so you don't feel crowded. The staff (from the host to Joe, our server, as well as the busboy) were all very friendly and our water glasses were never empty.

We arrived with 25 minutes left on the lunch specials which included a variety of sushi and Chinese dishes so we ordered the shrimp and scallop in Hunan sauce Chinese lunch special which included your choice of steamed or fried rice, an egg roll, and one of 3 soups (hot and sour, wonton and egg drop).  We also got a 2 roll sushi lunch special served with a miso soup.  It was a great deal for all the food we got.  

I probably would not get the egg drop soup again - it had a strange 'corny' taste to it and lo and behold I discovered corn at the bottom of the bowl! First time I had it like that and was not my favorite.  Everything else we had was very good.

I know all the sushi purists don't think Philadelphia rolls are sushi but I am a sucker for anything with cream cheese in it so for the 2 roll sushi special we opted for the Philadelphia rolls and the spicy tuna rolls. Sometimes rolls have too much rice and not enough fish in the pieces but these were perfect! The spicy tuna rolls had the right amount of spice to make it flavorful and packed a spicy punch.  They also happened to have fresh uni that they just got in so we had to order.  I never had it served with a perfectly ripened slice of avocado underneath and wow did it blow me away. The combo of the creamy avocado and the earthy creamy taste of the uni were so perfect together I'd drive all this way just for another bite of this. 

Would definitely be a regular customer if it was closer."}
{"text":"In ordered the sushi lunch two roll special with miso soup. The rolls I got were spicy salmon and spicy tuna. Woman working was really nice and my food was ready quickly. I'm going to try their actual Chinese food soon."}
{"text":"How many people have had Chinese food that totally wowed your tastebuds?  Like wowed to the point where you wanted to eat it every day, for every meal, because it had something that you couldn't find somewhere else.  I can't raise my hand on that one.  Don't get me wrong, I like Chinese food, but I have never been wowed.  I order the generic items such as cashew chicken, or beef and broccoli or General Tso and I love a good egg roll.  

Tai Pei has good food.  Good tasting Chinese food (and also sushi .. which I cannot review because it was not ordered).  The service was outstanding and everyone working was super friendly.  And on a Friday night, we were immediately sat and welcomed with prompt service. I will go back to Tai Pei when my craving for Chinese happens and I will know exactly what I will be getting when I order."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch.  Forgot what a great little place this is.  Forget the chain restaurants for good, fresh Chinese food this is the spot.  Orange beef and chicken were on target.  Waitstaff is attentive, portion size good.  Decor is a little dated but don't let that stop you.  Price is right too."}
{"text":"Our office is always looking for a new place to get delivery from, as the options around the office park can be slim... so we decided to switch it up from our regular Chinese restaurant delivery and give Tai Pei a try.  I think we've found a new favorite!  The first thing I noticed was how polite the girl on the phone was when taking our large order. When I called back 30 minutes later because I forgot to tell her we had a coupon for a free appetizer, she didn't even hesitate and said she would take care of it and send them out with our order (that was going out the door within mere minutes!).  The food was fresh and hot when it arrived.  Everyone was pleased with their lunch entree selections and soups, and I was over the moon with my maki roll lunch special. I LOVE that I can select from a few different rolls instead of being locked in to a combination every time.  Lunch for 5 people:  4 lunch entrees with rice and soup and 1 sushi lunch (2 rolls) with soup, came to $57 which is an absolute deal in my book.  I think we'll be ordering from here again very, very soon!"}
{"text":"Super nice environment among Chinese restaurants. Average price with large portion. Quite authentic despite the fact that they also sell Americanized Asian dishes. 
Go for their Peking Duck!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Quick delivery.  *CAUTION*  The $2.00 delivery charge is not listed on the menu.  SURPRISE...It's listed on your bill.  *CAUTION*   A tad pricey.  Oh yeah..I live in Pittsburgh now..."}
{"text":"I have only had takeout from Tai Pei, but the chicken lo mein was delicious and the general tso's was the best I have ever had! It was sweet, but still had a kick to it. Nothing was over priced and we weren't waiting forever for delivery. Will definitely visit the restaurant in the future!"}
{"text":"High class Asian dining in every way but the cost! Inexpensive for the food packed with flavor, excellent service, and free odds n ends to munch on before and after the meal!"}
{"text":"just got back from TaiPei. today was dinner AND a floor show. First, the food was adequate, except for the won ton for two which was full of won tons, shrimp and chicken. with a light and not greasy broth.It was good.  The floor show erupted soon after we were seated, when a young woman across the way began to harangue her mother...her mom apparently hadn't gone to enough of her soccor games as a child, didnot know the names of her teammates, had never taken a picture of her on the field, and couldn't make up her mind about getting a f&^%ing iphone 5....i know all this because she wasn't shy about letting everyone in the restaurant hear her, or letting the expletives fly. apparently no one has ever told her to knock it off, including and especially from my perspective, the manager of taiPei. He stood across the room with his mouth agape in shock, but with no concern about the comfort of his other patrons and their dining experience. It was a bizarre and uncomfortable experience, and follows a pattern of poor management decisions i have seen at tai pei recently.They know how to take in the money, but are less than concerned with anything else."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Tai Pei once a week or so, but within the last few years, it has gone severely downhill. The food is greasy, way too expensive, and they use massive amounts of MSG. I got terrible MSG poisoning from Tai Pei and ever since then, have gone to Jimmy Wan's down the road."}
{"text":"Paid $32 for three early bird specials - all three were beef broccoli. The meat, in every single one, was the lowest possible quality, to the point of being inedible. It didn't appear to be pure fat, but it had the texture of fat. Makes me queasy just typing it and thinking about it. It. Was. Awful! Never again."}
{"text":"The order was timely and the food was good. I have had better sushi, but not worth a bad rating. I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I had always heard good things about Tai Pei, but not living in that area, I was not really making an effort to go there.  Now that we have moved a bit closer to easier access to the Waterworks area, we decided to give it a try when we saw a Groupon for it.  SUCH A GREAT EXPERIENCE!

Comfortable environment, great service, and good food... the overall experience was an enjoyable one.  The scallion pancakes were the best that I have ever tried, and my chicken and broccoli was perfect (I know it is a basic dish, but to be honest, there are plenty of places that cannot seem to get it right).  

We will definitely be back!  They have a repeat customer coming there way!"}
{"text":"Today I treated my mother to lunch here because I had a Groupon. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer which I have to admit was AWFUL! They cover it in a tempura batter and it was to thick and flavorless.

But besides that we decided to go for two sushi rolls. The first was the lobster roll which was delicious! And the portion size was big. Second was the Figu or Fugi roll with crab and tuna! The crab salad they served on the side was fantastic was our favorite thing of the meal! Most definitely would recommend the sushi as for the other dishes not sure of but everyone in the place was raving about their rolls..."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout and overall it was pretty good. I ordered the the shrimp fried rice and they shrimp were huge. I also ordered the ruby chicken which was horrible. It was sooo sweet and it was basically just chicken and orange sweet and sweet and sour sauce. The spring roll was delicious and so was the soup. I will go back for sure if only for the shrimp fried rice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to sushi. Love it. They're always clean, fast, friendly. My husband doesn't like sushi much and orders Chinese and he also loves it. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"$42 (after tip) for flavorless dumplings fried in bad grease, inedibly bland and slimy hot and sour soup. Terribly over priced. Only saving grace was the sushi, which was decent but still overpriced. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"After receiving multiple recommendations for this place, I decided to give it a shot. But upon reading the recent negative reviews, I became nervous. They all had the common theme of: \"used to be great, went downhill, too expensive, try Jimmy Wan's.\" In spite of all that, I called ahead about 20 minutes prior to arrival on a Saturday night to get a table for 6, including two high chairs. We were seated promptly. The place wasn't packed but it was far from dead. Our drink orders were taken and fulfilled and refilled lickety split. We were somewhat indecisive about our entrees, but our appetizers got put in and brought out in a very well-timed fashion. 

Between the four adults, we ordered two egg rolls, crab rangoon (6) and a vegetable roll. All were very good. The sushi was so good that we ordered another to share. In spite of ordering it last second, it still came out before our hot entrees, which were general tso's chicken and sesame beef. I rate both of these high. Chicken was crispy, not overly sweet or greasy with just a touch of spiciness. Sesame new was new to me but i had a bite and liked it

Prices were $13-$17 for the entrees. Some of the chef's specials could get pricey, but there are big ticket items at every sit down restaurant. 

As for the service, it was courteous, prompt and, best of all, patient when it came to wrangling our hyperactive baby. The server was conscientious about keeping plates and other implements away from our grabby baby and didn't give us dirty looks for the puffs that littered the floor beneath his high chair (note: we tried to pick up as many as we could before we left). I think at our somewhat unfocused pace, we ended up being there for over an hour and we never felt rushed. Nor did we need to flag anyone down for service.

My only regret is that I didn't try something more adventurous. On my way to the bathroom, I noticed a hot pot, some dumpling soup, some kind of dish that sizzled like crazy as they brought it out and some sort of sweet, sort of rice wine-y smell that made me wish I had taken advantage of their liquor license.I also got a good glimpse at their sushi bar, which looked quite nice with all of the fresh fish on display. 

At any rate, I would most definitely come back here. It deserves its $$ rating here, but it's no more expensive than going to China Palace in Shadyside (one of my favorites)."}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I ordered lunch from Tai Pei many years ago, and I remember not being all that impressed. So despite living right down the road from this place, I haven't ever eaten here aside from that one time. However, Groupon can usually convince me to try just about anything (thanks Groupon!), so when I saw that I could grab some food here at a discount, I decided that it was high time to give this place another go.

And I'm really glad that I did! We came for dinner on a busy Saturday evening, and while it took awhile for someone to acknowledge us, once we were seated, we had very warm and friendly service from our waitress Rose. They begin each meal with complimentary wonton-type fried crisps served with homemade duck and spicy mustard sauce. I'm not a mustard fan, but my husband declared it the most delicious mustard he's ever had at a Chinese restaurant. For our meals, we ordered the chicken with broccoli and general tso's (their menu is largely geared toward the typical Americanized Chinese offerings, which I'm unabashedly a fan of....assuming they are executed well, of course). The food came out in short order and it was surprisingly delicious. The sauce in the broccoli chicken dish was flavorful and not overly oily, which a lot of sauces of this nature tend to be. The broccoli was fresh, plentiful, and cooked to a perfect texture. As for the general tso's, the chicken was crispy and high quality (no grisly, fatty, or otherwise questionable pieces of meat here). The general tso's sauce was fairly well-balanced...I would've liked a little more heat, but compared to most general's tso's sauces, it managed to avoid being overly sticky sweet and one-note. 

The portions were generous....in fact, they are kind of in a gray area where one meal is almost too much for one person (unless you have a really big appetite), but it's not quite enough for two (unless you each want a light dinner). And that's my biggest complaint about Tai Pei....it feels a little overpriced for Chinese food because their prices reflect their larger portions (e.g., I think we paid $16 or $17 for the general tso's, which is much higher compared to similar restaurants). I wish they would offer their dinners in smaller sizes with corresponding lower prices. I don't need a quart of chicken with broccoli for dinner...why can't I order a pint like at other Chinese restaurants? And yes, I know you can obviously take leftovers home, but I think the food is best eaten fresh. Note that they do offer cheaper and smaller sizes for lunch, so my complaint here only applies to dinner.

So I'm taking one star off for the higher prices and lack of size options on their dinner menu. But other than that, this a great choice for this type of cuisine. I'll definitely be back. I periodically see a lot of coupons for this place floating around...Groupon, Clipper Magazine, and even on the back of Market District receipts. So if you want to save a few bucks, make sure you search around for a coupon before you go!"}
{"text":"I pass this all of the time but finally decided to stop.  The restaurant is incredibly clean and it was great service, but I felt like the food was just \"okay.\"  Nothing to brag/boast about.  Prices are fair.  Maybe so many groupons because not enough people are raving about it?"}
{"text":"What a gem!  This restaurant consistently delivers both good food and service.  Great selection of Taiwanese options for any palate!  Huge shrimp and scallops, a good quantity of food for the price...and sushi options as well!"}
{"text":"Really, really tasty food here. We like to try out new places all the time, but had never been here before - we have tried \"the competition\" nearby, and liked it a lot.

Today, we wanted to see why this restaurant always looks like it's packed. Now we know. The service was impeccable, and we thought the restaurant was spotlessly clean. The food was spot on - from the shumai (tastes like it's made from scratch) to the Taipei Special Dumplings (which have a tasty thin exterior and a rich, savory pork filling), we enjoyed our appetizers very much.

The main dishes were equally as nice - we had the crispy shrimp and broccoli (lightly battered crispy shrimp and a great sweet chili garlic sauce) and at our waiter's suggestion, the basil rice noodles with chicken. I must say that the basil rice noodle dish was the best of the day; flavorful thin chicken slices with fresh basil tossed in with the delicious noodles and a little bit of sauce. The dish just works... Like other Chinese restaurants, the portions are large, and we probably should have only ordered one entree for the two of us after enjoying the two appetizers. Food was served at the correct temperature, too, which is something I always look for. (I hate it when food is too hot or too cold when it is served!)

There is room for improvement with regards to the actual menu - it's too big, and has too many items on too many pages, making it a bit difficult to make up ones' mind, but this is hardly unique to Taipei, and I would say 99% of Chinese restaurants have this problem...

Prices are reasonable, and overall, it was a nice Saturday lunch experience.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A group of five of us went to Tai Pei last night to celebrate two birthdays.  Everyone was very pleased with their meals and soups.  I ordered a sprig roll which was light and flaky, not at all greasy.  My main course was Hunan shrimp which I requested extra spicy. It was very good with plenty of large shrimp.  I would definitely go back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch.  We were seated right away.  We had sushi which was very fresh and delicious; Basil Chicken was mildly spicy but very flavorful. As an appetizer we did have the vegetable steamed dumplings which were very tasty and full of vegetables but we both thought the dumpling dough was a bit thick, but did not deter us to finish it all.  They have a full bar, wines and drink specials.  Full sushi menu and their regular menu has something for everyone, lots of choices.  Will definately go back."}
{"text":"Went there for a late lunch/ early dinner. We ordered spider sushi rolls, Hawaiian chicken, and general tso chicken. 
For starters everyone is very friendly. The place is clean. They have nice table cloths and fancy cloth napkins. Unfortunately the atmosphere didn't make up for the sub par food. I've had way better Chinese sushi at giant eagle of all places. The rolls were not tightly wrapped and they were so large it took 3-4 bites for each one. It turned into a giant mess. 
The Hawaiian chicken although the presentation was lovely it was so salty I could only manage a few bites. 
The general tso chicken again had beautiful presentation but the sauce was was sticky and gooey; kind of a strange consistency. 
While it seems like they spend a lot of time and effort on \" show\", when I go to restaurant I'm looking for good food to back that up. Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the restaurant in many years.  It is attractive and comfortable.  The staff is friendly and the service was efficient.  My General Tso's tofu was tasty, but the portion was small for $9 for lunch.  This, after all, is not a meat or seafood item.  The restaurant could afford to offer more for the price. The chicken egg roll was not hot.  The saving grace was the crispy noodles, which helped to satisfy me."}
{"text":"Amazing food and first class service. Finally a restaurant that cares about their clientele. From the minute we walked in, down to our waitress hand making the Moo Shu we ordered. Awesome awesome!!"}
{"text":"My favorite local place for Chinese.  Meal Service is quick, sushi is a little on the slow side.  Usually coupons available too.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am so bummed to see bad reviews for Taipei!  I have been going to Taipei for a good 5-6 years.  I have never once been disappointed.  I've referred many friends and family to Taipei, who have thanked me because they now love it!

I get a variety of food, depending on my mood. 

It is almost always sushi!  Spicy Crunchy Tuna roll and a Philadelphia roll.  If I have a meal deal of sorts, I will get a 3rd roll.  I have never once (as I said) been disappointed.  Their sushi is always fresh - and honestly the best sushi I have had in Pittsburgh.  

They always know my name - when I walk in it's \"Hi Jessica\" - whether i am eating there or getting take out.  The staff is always super friendly.  I go out of my way to go get take out from them because I like it - THAT MUCH.  Give them a chance, get some yumminess!"}
{"text":"Rarely have I ever had a mediocre meal from Tai Pei. We typically order delivery, which, regardless of how busy they are, is always delivered in less than 45 minutes. Tai Pei is definitely my favorite Chinese delivery in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I ordered from this place and the staff was INCREDIBLY rude when they delivered my order. The woman not only rang my doorbell 5 times but she BANGED, and I mean BANGED, on our window of our house without even a second of wait in between. When I opened the door the woman threw my food at me and told me never to order again as she called me TWICE with no answer (my fiancé was upstairs sleeping with his phone, but our home is clearly marked and we've never had problems before). I handed her the money and told her I wasn't giving her a tip then and she LOST IT. I closed the door and she walked away. What in the actual heck? You guys lost a customer forever and I'll never recommend you to anyone. That was insanely rude."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with our 15 month old right as they opened, so they were pretty empty.  The staff was so so friendly and helpful with our daughter.  The food was also very tasty.  We ordered a sushi roll to split and then got our own dishes to eat.  This was a great amount of food to have leftovers for lunch the next day (which IMO is always the goal for chinese food).  I got the chicken and broccoli, and thought there was a good ratio of chicken to broccoli.  
I would definitely eat here again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"I may owe Tai Pei another try, but my first visit there left me with a so-so opinion. The interior and ambiance are nice - clean restaurant with friendly staff. Parking was a little tight on a Friday night, but I think that is just an intrinsic problem with their location.

I had General Tso's chicken - usually a good benchmark for any American Chinese spot. The sauce was a little less spicy than I prefer, but the odd thing was its consistency - very thick and syrup-like. I was also disappointed that no broccoli was included with the meal - just chicken and white rice for sixteen dollars. We had crab and cheese wontons as well and these were tasty.

It seems like this is a Fox Chapel mainstay, but I wasn't too thrilled with my overall meal. If I'm in the area again, I may drop by to try something else, but I'm not sure if it's worth the trip for me with other options nearby."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this after all the hype. When moving everyone kept saying, you will love Tai Pei!
Last night we ordered take out and it left us disappointed. My fiancé got the amazing chicken and I got sesame chicken. We also ordered crab ragoons. Both of our chicken meals left us wanting something more as far as flavor. Mine needed a bit more sauce to make not as dry. But, our crab ragoons were fantastic. 
I can't say much for service since this was take out, but the portion sizes are huge. This makes the prices a bit more bearable because you're getting a lunch and dinner out of the meal. I'm just not that excited for my lunch. There's not much left to say. Maybe we will go back to try the sushi? We will see!"}
{"text":"Calm and quiet, great for an intimate date
Night. Service is excellent. The food is also delicious. Huge portions, but it's also pricey, so that balances out. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here for take out. I've always wanted to try their food. I got their turnip cake and spicy tuna sushi. The price in my opinion is a little high. The turnip cake was really good, I haven't have these in a long time, and I'll say I was pretty satisfied :) the spicy tuna roll was good too but it's not outstanding and I think both of these items can be cheaper. I paid about $12 total and I thought they're not worth this much. However, it was my first time here and I only got snacks (in my opinion these were snacks lol) so I will definitely return to this place for an actual meal. I will update my review once I do."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise.  I really like sushi, but I don't like having to always drive into the city for decent sushi.  I recently discovered this place just a couple of miles from my house located in the suburbs.  I've tried it twice now.  The first time I was a little nervous about trying the sushi... again, due to its location.  Fox Chapel is better known for Starbucks rather than good ethnic food.  I had the curried chicken and the steamed dumplings.  These were both of good quality.  I thought the curry with the chicken lacked a little flavor, but I'm from the caribbean and used to west indian curry.  The dumplings were nice because they actually were light and not too heavy like they usually are.  I think probably the best chinese in town is the Sesame Inn with a few locations, but this place is fine.  What I am really impressed with is the Sushi.  I had lunch there today and was impressed with the servie and the chef.  The service was really good... maybe a little too much attention, but better that than the alternative.  The Chef seemed to be a trained sushi chef.  I'm guessing he learned his trade in Asia.  I had some excellent quality white tuna, which was delicious.  I also had the spicy scallop with avocado sushi.  It was really nice with great texture with the creaminess of the avocado and sushi and the crunchiness of something else (not sure  what).  I also had the crabmeat sushi, which was pretty good quality.  The rice had good flavor and the right amount of stickiness.  The sushi was wrapped perfectly.  The chef was helpful and very nice.  I would have preferred authentic wasabi instead of the pasty type stuff you get everywhere, but again that's pretty standard.  I didn't try any of the rolls.  I don't typically eat rolls, because they usually are pretty heavy and one of the reasons I eat sushi is to offset my typical gluttony.  However, the selection seemed really good and I was told by another customer at the sushi bar that the TAI PEI 101 Roll was great.  It should be with a $24 pricetag for a roll.  The ingredients are 7 oz. of lobster, eel, asparagus, onion, cucumber, and seaweed salad.  If this place were in the city I would probably just give it 3 stars, but the fact that it's in the burb's and has this good quality justifies the 4 stars.  And, they deliver!"}
{"text":"The food here is quasi, a little price and the service is hit or miss. I've had waiters that were nice. But the owner , always has this cranky look on her face like you took her to court or divorced here.  I wouldn't make a special trip here.I had their udon stir fry, and general tso's neither was good. It was edible, just not good. lask flavors, oh wait, the flavor of salt. and loads of soy."}
