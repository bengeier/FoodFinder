{"text":"Came here for the second time, and I am very impressed by the speedy/ friendly service. There is a lot more variety on the menu (compared to SPIN), and the place is clean with a good amount of comfortable seating. Definitely my new go-to place :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!! Fast and friendly. I'm so happy I discovered this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great desserts, huge portions! Service is quite quick, even though lineups on the weekend are out the door. Wait time goes by quickly. A large menu with lots of options and the opportunity to switch sauces or drizzles on your dessert, if you ask. The ice creams are very tasty. Everything from crepes to waffles and great big slices of cake. The atmosphere is very lively and busy. Always lots of people, generally a younger, university student type crowd. I'll definitely come back to satisfy my sweet tooth. Might need a doggy bag next time!"}
{"text":"It's really hard to get dessert wrong - especially cheesecake and ice cream. How do you mess those two up?? Somehow D Spot managed to serve me a slice of red velvet cheesecake that was definitely several days old. You could tell it had been sliced a few days ago because the sides were dried up like old cakes get. Then, I had a \"scoop\" (more of a smear??) of birthday cake ice cream. I have never before had ice cream that tasted grainy? The texture was just awful and the flavour didn't make up for it. It tasted like sandy ice cream. Dessert is the best part of the meal, to mess it up is criminal."}
{"text":"A good demtres substitute if you don't have the chain near your place. Serving almost similar items as the dessert chain. Came in during the day to avoid the evening crowd. We have driven by it at night and can see line ups out the door!  Located under some low rise condos and parking is quite limited since it is shared with the same plaza as LCBO. This location use to be Spin Dessert and then they changed their name.. layout though is the same as the previous owner. Tried their molten lava cake (about 12$) and that came with two slab of vanilla ice cream and some oreo bits. It was good but wasn't out of the world. Also tried a cookie dough ice cream waffle, but instead of having only cookie dough ice cream, we did half pistachio and half cookie dough (as recommended by our server), this waffle could definitely feed like 3 or 4 people! Its huge, and when they say one scoop of ice cream its like the size of a foot ball. HUGE portions!! Unfortunately it was only mediocre... waffle was good, but nothing super special about it. Pricing was also only ok, waffle is about 14$ per plate but if you're splitting among 4 people it is definitely well worth it.  Probably will not be returning as cravings for dessert is not really my thing. Nice atmosphere and great staff though!"}
{"text":"Another great cafe to check out.  We decided to try the pina colada cake with vanilla ice cream.  The ice cream was smooth and creamy and the cake was just delightful.  Service was spot on.  Our server was enthusiastic and the manager was an amazing guy.  What a lovely experience and I would recommend anyone with a sweet tooth to visit D Spot.  Best part is they are open late hours."}
{"text":"When I first walked in, I was so excited to try the new desserts and foods! The vibe of the store totally changed, everything is more fun and exciting! They even upgraded the menu and had more desert and food options than what they had at Spins (previous dessert cafe). Huge portions, fast and friendly service but the only thing is I don't think the quality of the foods is the same as what it used to be when the cafe used to be Spins. I got the Thank You Berry Much with a crepe and it was ok. The ice cream tasted artificial, almost like Pepto Bismol. Then I tried it again another time and I got an apple pie and my friend got the lava cake. Our plates looked like a mess, and the vanilla ice cream had a weird aftertaste.   All in all, this place improved aesthetically but the quality of foods is definitely not as good as it used to be when the store was Spins. Would probably recommend to people who are not picky about their foods."}
{"text":"came in here one night with my boyfriend. I came here a lot when it used to be spin so it was my first time at d spot and it is NOT better than spin. prices are so high and I observed the owner Rahim's behaviour after he came to our table to introduce himself. very bossy towards his workers and the employees make customers to vote for them and give them 5 star ratings which is not fair because this place is not good what so ever. very stingy with their adds on and limited amount is being given. will not recommend."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  Three of us ordered two desserts tea and coffee. Everything was really good (I take the dairy stuff on word from the others as I can't partake). A warm loving crepe and a birthday cake ice cream Sunday. It has been a really long time since we went out for dessert so my wife enjoyed the Sunday but said the ice cream was not that great. We mentioned this and it was passed along to the owner. He came by. Apologized and was overly generous in taking things off the bill.   He said he takes quality very seriously and he will not have people leaving his place unhappy. You can tell that he really means what he says.   All I can say is the place is great. Excellent service and delicious coffee and desserts. It is clean (way cleaner than the old place that was here used to be) and everything looks fresher and tastier.   Come here and you will love it. The owner will make sure you leave happy!  I can tell you that we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My hot dessert drink was okay, nothing special. But they do get bonus points for carrying lactose free milk. But also kinda shitty that they have barely no desserts that don't contain milk. Overall, it's an okay spot, but no nearby free parking. Service was friendly, but food and menu wasn't as refined as Dunk n Dip"}
{"text":"When Spins gets a fancy makeover, you get D Spot. Tonight was my first after the ownership change and I certainly don't regret it.  I ordered road trip on a waffle. It was huge and more than what I would've expected for the price. I'd probably go for their crepes next time. My friend ordered the Hawaiian pizza and it looked delicious. So don't underestimate their capacity to make savoury dishes, just because their desserts are to die for!  Also: * The interiors are almost unchanged - the colours are more vibrant now. It feels like the space got bigger, but it didn't really - only a better interior designer with the dedication to make this place cozier but not too too cozy. It feels more like a chill spot now.  * They accept card payments, unlike Spins that only accepted cash. The menu is pretty good, but does miss a little bit of Spins variety. * Friendly staff who know their menu and are great with helping narrow down options to meet your preferences."}
