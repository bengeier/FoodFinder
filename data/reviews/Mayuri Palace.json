{"text":"I had to find a new and interesting place to write my first Yelp review, and I think Mayuri Palace was a good choice.  My husband and I went to their lunch buffet the other day and I was floored with the selection.  I'm not an expert by any means on Indian food, but I've eaten at Tandoori times in Scottsdale, and while I liked their flavors, the food here just tastes authentic and really fresh.  The dosa that they brought out was also nice and crispy and also went well with their paneer dish.   Oh and the goat curry was really really good!  I've never eaten goat before and for the price we were paying which was like $11, it was a surprise to get something so exotic.  To end the meal, they had a table with some great sweets as well.  I don't know what any of them were called, sorry :) but I have to say they were all so good.  What a great meal!  I can't wait to go back.  My in laws are coming in to town for July 4th weekend and I plan to bring them here for a taste of India in the middle of Phoenix.  Thanx Mayuri!  Really great job!"}
{"text":"Food quality is very bad. Had stone in their food. Don't go to this place.  When told the person at the counter he just said this happen's and they can't control it."}
{"text":"We went for the lunch buffet today and most of the food trays were empty.!! When we mentioned this to the owner,  he was unapologetic and defensive. Really bad experience all around.

Would not go to this place again."}
{"text":"I brought my daughter to try Indian food for the first time and was blown away at how delicious everything was!!  The food had amazing flavors and was cooked perfectly.  And the service was awesome! We will definitely be returning and telling our friends what an awesome place this is!"}
{"text":"How unfortunate....it had been a while since I had been here and had my bad experience but my partner thought maybe they had improved and cleaned up things and she wanted to try it. Things looked clean, we got plates, I went to sit down...anther cockroach in the napkins!!! I couldn't believe the same exact thing happened twice!! A sign to never return.

To the owners....CLEAN YOUR KITCHEN!!!

                             CALL IN THE PEST CONTROL!!

                           
UGH!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant after finding a Groupon deal. We ordered the medhu vada (lentil donut app), malai kofta (veggie dumplings), and malabar fish curry. Everything was delicious but the veggie dumplings were amazing! The sauce was perfectly spiced and super creamy. It was the best Indian dish I've ever had! I love Indian food and would say that of all the Indian restaurants I've tried in the Phoenix area,  this is the best!"}
{"text":"Love this place, but let's get the prices and days straight.  They are CLOSED on Monday.  Tues-Thurs the lunch buffet is $9.99.  Fri $11.99.  Sat/Sun $12.99.
I haven't noticed a difference in the food selection on either day, but maybe I'm missing something.  
First thing I like: 
The have real Basmati white rice.  Tasty.  
Next:
The always have a good selection of soups and dishes on the buffet although lately, haven't seen any goat curry, only fish.
The bad:
Usually I go later, around 2 and the tea is either out or cold.  The paneer can also be gone.  I guess I have to get my act together and get there earlier!"}
{"text":"Picked up takeout. I had vegetable vindaloo - it was excellent and super spicy. Husband had tandoori shrimp and was very happy. The naan was perfect - the right mix of doughy and flat. Definitely will eat here again."}
{"text":"Decent food. Mango lassi is very good. But the biryani here is not the biryani you expect."}
{"text":"I thought of giving -2 rating but change my mind because of just courtesy that restaurant people replaced some of the food after complaining. 
We ordered Veg and Non Veg combinations during our dinner and told them to prepare medium to high spice. When we tasted the Chilli Chicken spice was on higher side. Being a south Indian I never had that kind of spice even in India. Even for other dishes there is no uniform spice maintained. Even Chat masala is worse taste and Surprisingly Malai kofta is spicier. 

don't order mango lassy, because you will get 10ML of lassy and rest of the glass filled with foam. 

I would suggest If anyone want to eat here, say low spice. 

I would suggest avoid this place."}
{"text":"I came here with coworkers expecting great food.  

Lunch Buffet dine in folks beware!!!!
We saw cockroaches and bugs crawling on the wall that the buffet was up against.  We also saw them on the buffet right near the food!!!!

We saw a cockroach fall in the paneer.  It was crawling around the buffet and fell in!!! No Lie!  Right in front of me and two friends-Yuck!  

My friend told the waitress and she came back with a towel and wiped down the wall instead.  We were all so grossed out.  

Needless to say never judge a book by its cover.  The spread may look appetizing but look around you!! Look at the walls and pay attention!  

I did report this to the owner and he said he would take care of it.  Let's see if others take the time to write about their lunch with the bugs.  My stomach hurts thinking about it!  I will NOT be back.   Dirty dining at its finest!"}
{"text":"We love this place!!! The food here is closest to what you get in India. The spice level and taste is perfect and one can try any dish fearlessly as all of them taste good. My favorite is goat biriyani. Buffet lunches here are great too. They just need to work on their desserts. Finally, service here is great too. The staff here are my favorite-Bindu and Lijjin are great.  Hope they keep up their standards in future too."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent! And at a restaurant, you would think that would be about all it takes. I generally agree, but we won't be back. Maybe it was just an oddly busy night for a usually slow restaurant, but the service was sub par.

We were given one menu and promised another that never came. Once seated, we were not introduced to our waiter for 20+ minutes. The wait for food was pretty long, but more excusable than just never taking our order. When it arrived, we had only one of our two entrees. I asked our waiter (and another) if it was coming out and they never came back to address it. After we had finished splitting the one entree and waited another 10 minutes, the other was brought out. Just odd.

Maybe under different circumstances this review would be 4/5. As I said, our entrees and garlic naan were delicious. If you are not in a hurry or starving, maybe check out Mayuri Palace. 2/5 seems harsh, but as Yelp puts it \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Been there on Saturday noon. It had hell lot of items for buffet n most of them were good."}
{"text":"Food portions are generous and tasty. The waitresses are generally attentive, always remember us. And the prices are reasonable. I've lived in the Bay Area for quite a while, and I've been spoiled by the Indian restaurant selections there. Mayuri is pretty close in quality and price to my favorite Indian restaurant in the East Bay."}
{"text":"We found this place on groupon and the food was excellent! The service was a little slow and the overall decor of the restaurant was a little dated. But the food was good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time I have ever left a bad review or contacted the health department. There was cockroaches scurrying on the ground to the left side of the buffet. Told the waitress and she didn't do anything about it. When I went to pay the $38 for 3 of us that didn't eat a lot because of loss of appetites. They didn't care at all. I reported it to the health department. Now I am reading on here i am not the only one who seen them. Wish I read the reviews first. Disgusting!!!! You couldn't pay me to ever eat there again. With numerous complaints think they would clean it up."}
{"text":"It was a very nice atmosphere and people were nice and helpful but i thought their e was a little steep for the options at $12.99.. They fill u up with the multiple bread options so u eat less."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon at Mayuri Palace and was very pleased! Their butter naan was fantastic and their Chicken Tikka Masala was great. Wasn't thrilled with our Mayuri Special Chutney Wala Chicken. And their decor is super weird. Otherwise, great food and service."}
{"text":"Very poor quality. We order potato paratha. And paratha was old it
Was black you can say it's to old.very bad test too. Don't west your time
And money here."}
{"text":"We went last to last week for lunch. There was a stone in the dal. I have almost broken my tooth. Manager was not there. Called and texted him but still no response. I will not recommend any one to visit this place. See the posted pictures of the stone."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! I go for the lunch buffet. I love the atmosphere, decor and staff. I feel at home when I am here and don't want to leave. It has a warmth to it like whomever own/runs this place is putting their heart and soul into it, the energy is great. The food is always delicious, fragrant and beautiful. It is so difficult to decide what to choose from the buffet as it is pretty extensive on the weekend. I hate that I get full so easily and am unable to try more varieties of the food."}
{"text":"Food was really spicy today. Wish they bring Naan bread freshly made to the booth. Not coming back again for $26 lunch buffet for two!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing I recommend it to everyone. I'm making plans to eat there with great friends 1st timers tomorrow and I know they will love it.. its so authentic and wonderful whether ur new to Indian food or a conosur!! The owner is wonderful as well and very nice."}
{"text":"Good food, good quality.  Nice service, but could use  refills on drinks while we were in.  However, the food and taste made up for this."}
{"text":"Super tasty and super friendly wait staff. Also lots of vegetarian options on the HUGE menu! Great stuff. Ill be back for sure! Hard to find a tasty Indian restaurant around here and now I did!"}
{"text":"So we got a Groupon to try an India restaurant Mayuri Palace that was under new ownership. We started off with an appetizer the vegetable samosa.  They were very good.  It was a basically a vegetable empanada with a tamarind sauce and a green chili puree as a sauce for dipping, great flavor and all around a good dish. For our entree's we ordered the lamb seekh kabob. I was very disappointed with this dish the lamb was very dry and the amount of actual ground lamb you received for a $14 entrée was small. We also got the Mayuri special chicken.  Again very disappointed the sauce had so much cracked black pepper and was so over seasoned you could not even taste the chicken or other vegetables in the dish.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years and I am fully convinced that we were just eating the leftovers from their lunch buffet.  The reason I say this is because the lamb was so dry it seemed like it was just reheated after it's first cooking and the sauce for the chicken was so reduced it was salty, as thick as plaster and over seasoned it had to be just simmering away on the buffet and then just reheated for dinner.  I have had wonderful Tandoori chicken from this pace as well as masala curry but this trip was a huge disappointment.  The one thing that saved dinner was the wonderful company from my girlfriend"}
{"text":"Food quality was good but unsanitary restaurant conditions. I was greeted by a roach when I snagged my plate off the buffet line, my water glass had floaties and service wasn't great. They have all of the windows darkened out for what I am assuming is to save on electricity and makes the atmosphere feel like the restaurant is something out of the Goonies. 

I'm a fan of Indian food but unfortunately the roaches ate my appetite too. Thankfully dogs have good immune systems right?"}
{"text":"I freaking LOVE this place I have been there four times and the Lunch buffet is consistently amazing. There are about 5 other Indian places in our neighborhood and they are either too strong and taste like incense or they are not as flavorful, Mayuri Palace is just right. The service is great and they offer up stuff other places don't!
Try it!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this India Restaurant for a while and was disappointed in the ownership changed as this restaurant has now gone down the hill.  I usually order the normal fare, chicken tandoori and lamb saag for take out.  One day I ordered my normal take out.  Now you must understand, as somebody who doesn't have tha tmuch money, ordering from this restaurant is a big treat for me as this restaurant is QUITE expensive.  So it was a big surprise and disappointment,  when i saw that I received 3 small pieces of chicken for $14.  Now this surprised me because normally I would get 6-7 pieces.  I called the restaurant to let them know what had happened and  they said \"that's how it is and it usually comes with about 3 pieces\"  I was flabbergasted, as i have ordered from there many times before.  I asked them \"so you're saying for $14 I will get 3 small dry pieces of chicken from now on\"? and their answer was \"yes\".

Needless to say I will not be going back to this place again, as new management does not know customer service.  Also expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"We were here on a Sunday afternoon for the lunch buffet.

The spread is quite good. The vegetable biryani and paneer side dishes were all excellent. The price too seemed quite reasonable. The non -vegetarian too was suposed to be quite good. But the desserts were the best. Authentic Indian desserts --fresh n yummy !  

Nice place. Try it once."}
{"text":"I came to this place when it was Indian Paradise 2 and got my order to-go it was absolutely horrible but decided to give them another chance since they changed the name recently to Mayuri Place. My mom just moved to Arizona and has never had a curry so I brought her to this place and the service was great but the food was horrible again. I have had many curries and this place just doesn't compare. :-("}
{"text":"I just went to Mayuri place using a groupon.  I have never been there before, but wanted to try someplace new. I was very pleasantly surprised with my experience.  The lady who served us was delightful and very sweet.  The pappadum was the best I've had and the sauce delicious! I tried the samosa and it had a very yummy sauce with garbanzo beans scattered around it.   I then had the chicken tikka masala and chicken kurma.  Both very delicous with great spice.  The naan was was also crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside.  Everything was truly delicious.  I will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!!! Always excellent food! I'd recommend this place for an Indian any day!!"}
{"text":"The buffet is great for lunch, however I'd ask for fresh naan.  The naan at the buffet is kind of hard.  The lady at the register couldn't get the credit card machine to work so asked if we had cash, one of us did and the other didn't.  So after 15 minutes of trying the machine, she said we could pay her next time.  
Over all, the food is good, but I've had fresher Indian food down the street :)"}
{"text":"Returned here twice since my last review and, its no longer a place i will go to for indian buffet.
Every thing was over cooked and very bland as well as no varity. The first time out of the two times it was showing signs of no longer being a good buffet that at one time was pretty good. The second time about 2weeks later we went just to see if it got any beter like perhaps they had an off day. And lo and behold the second time around the food was even worse. And what is a double slap in the face is the price, i believe its 13 or 14 dollars. It wasent even worth 7 dollars. Its too bad because the first few times i ate here the food was actually not to bad and some what tastey. I hope the owner reads these reviews."}
{"text":"The last time I was here was in December.  I thought the food was spectacular.  Today, three months later, not so much.  Had the chicken biryani and the shrimp sag.  Asked for the sag (spinach) to be made without dairy.  There is another local restaurant that does this for me.  Well they accommodated my request but the dish turned out to be flavorless.  I didn't ask for the spices to be left out--just the dairy.  So the shrimp sag was so so and this is being generous.  The basmati rice that came with the shrimp sag lacked salt in its totality so it just tasted like white mush.  The chicken biryani was generous and had three pieces of chicken which was enough.  However, it was not tasty like the last time--again lacking in spices.  Everything was freshly made that has to be said.  The waitress gave us some raita (yogurt) and let us sample the \"sambar?\"when we inquired about what the buffet was like (before we got our food)   It was lentils in a tomato base.  Really good.  
The waitress was very polite, attentive and just an overall nice young lady.  
I am so disappointed in the food this time around though.  I know this cannot be the same chef who made our food the last time.  The bad thing about the restaurant business is the movement of chefs and staff.  Here today, gone tomorrow.  Today was a case where the former chef was greatly missed by us.  I don't think I would make another trip out to 24th Avenue and Bell to eat this indian food.  I thought I had found a gem, but sadly this is not the case. 
Management:  Work on your food... who was cooking in December that made my first visit so great???"}
{"text":"Yum! Mayuri Palace was a godsend when we discovered it after a long and frustrating day shopping for cars. Exhausted, cranky, and feeling starved my family stumbled through the doors. The restaurant felt clean and had a decent ambience. With a nice large menu we were almost overwhelmed, but went to some family favorites. The veggie samosas were delicious, but we were sad there were only 2. We really enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala, Paneer Tikka, and Lamb Vindaloo. All rich in flavor and cooked well! The garlic naan was perfect. We ordered gulab jamun for dessert and found them a little disappointing. 1/2 warm 1/2 cold like they had been quickly microwaved, and with a simple syrup, and no flavor like rose or cardamom. While we were dining we saw another table redeem a groupon, so we rushed on to see if they were available for purchase. They were (what luck!) and we snapped up a $15 for $30 deal and used it on our meal we were in the process of eating! Overall a great experience, and would certainly go back if we were in the area again!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and to try out the buffet.

The buffet had a good variety of curry dishes; goat, fish, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala.

The biryani was good.

Overall I would call this a good lunch value."}
{"text":"Curry was amazing!!!! we ordered two different kinds as our nice waiter recommended us and the amount was HUGE! we couldn't finish them so we brought it home and ate next day too! it was flavorful and authentic Indian curry!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant. We found Cockroaches. Manager having worst behavior with customer. 
Please think before going to this place."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this place, and man, it is probably some of the best Indian food in phoenix. The chicken Tikka Masala was amazing to the last drop wiped up with my garlic naan...great portions,  I got 1 order of chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, 2 orders garlic naan, veggie samosas $40...fed 4 of us pretty well.."}
{"text":"Love their buffet. Cheap and good quality.  Their paneer makhni is to die for. It is overall a clean place. Staff is friendly. They have one of the best Indian for in the area. 
2 thumbs up for sure."}
{"text":"Best Indian food ever. Amazing! Please visit and support the very sweet family that makes such exquisite food. I recommend the Tandoori chicken quite nice."}
{"text":"I really hesitate to write this review since so many people absolutely love the food at this place, so consider that when reading. We came early on a Friday night so it was pretty dead. Service was great and very friendly. We ordered chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. It came out hot and took about twenty minutes. The sauce was thicker, chunkier and less flavorful than I prefer. We ordered one \"spicy\" which meant extra jalapeños - not sure if thats authentic? There was ALOT of chicken bones in the sauce as well, which was unpleasant and we were constantly picking out pieces. The naan was very good. The price was spot on. The dining room is not very nice (you are definitely going for the food and not the atmosphere here) and the glass tops on the tables had old food smudged on. Since we have a place we love closer to us, we wouldn't return here. 

Final verdict - try it, you may love the food! It sounds like the buffet might be the way to go."}
{"text":"The food is authentic, flavorful, and you can tell,made from the heart. It feels like my grandma is back there cooking for everyone.  The place is beautiful, similar to a peaceful cabin. The owner is a great person to talk and is always accommodating for my pickiness. I love this place! I think everyone should try it out. They also have Indian karaoke once a month. I highly recommend this place. Even the buffett is good and not many Indian buffets are good. This place gets two thumbs up."}
{"text":"If there was an option of giving no star, that would have been my review for this place. I had visited this place a couple of times before our last visit but it wasn't such a horrible experience. We knew the service was always poor but atleast the food was decent.

Our last visit was on a Tuesday night, 10/22 and it wasn't even crowded. It took several glances, a couple of requests and 18mins for the server to get us water cups. We wanted to leave but since my lil one had fallen off to sleep in my lap, we decided to still have food.

Our orders were pretty simple (including Baingan Bharta, Dal and 2 naans). Believe it or not, it took 35mins for our food to come. On another table, 2 gentlemen who had come much later than us ordered Baingan bharta too and their order arrived first.

Fortunately or unfortunately it seemed that the owner was serving our table. Seriously, no courtesy, no politeness and no guilt for making someone wait an hour for basic order. He was full of stupid pride for reasons he alone knows.

The Baingan Bharta, it seemed was just one of the ready-to-eat frozen packets that was not even heated properly and served. If I had to have frozen meals, I would not have ordered it in a restaurant. The food was so bad and caused severe nausea and sickness for both me and my husband.

Lastly, as a fellow Indian, I am ashamed to call Mayuri an Indian restaurant claiming to serve good Indian food. The bad food and service is tragic but the lack of courtesy and basic humility is disastrous.

This place is dark, dingy, smelly and just not worth your visit - even if it is free. Not going back again!"}
{"text":"Anyone that writes a bad review for this place is seriously not looking for Indian food.  I see a lot of reviews about curtains, decor, etc, but people like me, who just want killer Indian food in a clean environment know what this place is really about.  I'm talking tikka masala, vindaloo, biriahini, and really great goat curry.  Their buffet is really beyond measure, and carry out is always a good time too.  I guess my advice is to come here hungry and leave satisfied simple as that.  Don't worry about what's not here, just worry about all the great things it has!  For the record I'd take this place and its decor over Tandoori Times any day."}
{"text":"As you walk into Mayuri Palace immediately you inhale exotic aromatic fragrances from the food and your mouth waters anticipating what you might try.

Many things I really liked a lot from and about Mayuri Buffet so I will start with those things first.

Of course I couldn't try everything but by a landslide to me the best dishes were the vegan dishes and this would have been a solid four star review if I only tried the vegan dishes. The dishes were all different but the one thing they all had in common were that they were WILDLY FLAVORFUL and VERY SPICY. Some of the names of the dishes were Pongal, Kosthu, Dal Fry, and  Butter Masala.

Out of the meat dishes I tried the Chilli Chicken was moist and very flavorful and good.

Durring my stay \"Butlered\" Naan bread was served and latter a crisp kind of crepe stuffed with a seasoned potato and pepper filling and latter yet a lacy sort crepe wrap.

The things I didn't care for.

Three other chicken dishes I tried had very dry non developed with flavor chicken. They were the Tandori, Biryani, and Masala. I also tried the Cod Curry. I couldn't eat that one either because the fish had that like purchased from Fry's or Safeway taste. It wasn't bad but it was that non fresh taste. But I DO NOTE fish from almost any buffet anywhere usually isn't good. 

My husband only took meat dishes and didn't care for them and disliked the goat most because of the meats dryness. 

They had many deserts but I narrowed it down to three to try. I didn't care for any of them. The worst one was the one that resembled a donut hole. It was fresh made of lumpy thick raw batter and was horrible. Another resembled a funnel cake but also had this raw texture. The carrot halwa was so sweet I thought my teeth would fall out. That was  almost good.

Service was clunky. They poured us water but didn't ask us if we wanted beverages till we were almost done. We also didn't receive the naan bread until we were half way done.

The pavement outside is uneven in one spot and IS HAZARDOUS.

Buffets do differ from day to day and hour to hour maybe some days they could be better.

3.5 stars I would go back because the vegan dishes were very  tasty.

Slight update*****************5-23-16

Buffet is about half the size from last time and offers around ten dishes. Chicken has improved from last time .....pretty good but few choices. I thought the Kadai Bhindi Masala was very tasty."}
{"text":"Food was very delicious!!!!!  Ordered Vegetable Korma (=Kurma--their spelling) + rice noodles, Chicken appetizers with the Indo-Manchurian sauce, Tandoori Chicken, and Garlic Naan.

Everything tasted very good and fresh.   The mint chutney is super bright green.

Servers were very friendly, and food came out fast.

Decor is odd, but I could care less about that.  I think it's always smart when restaurants start out slowly, replacing furniture and decor as they become more successful.  Less pressure for the owners to make money and scrimp on ingredients/care with the food.

Very happy that we tried this place because of Groupon.  We'll be back, even if means a longer drive.  Highly recommend!  After all, we went on a Sunday night, and the food was still super fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"We came around 9pm on a saturday night.  At that time they were no longer taking orders, so you had to eat at the buffet.  I am not a buffet type of person, but decided to give this one a try.

The buffet looked unappetizing.  Food looked like it was sitting there for awhile,  but since it was less than an hour before closing time, I understood.  But looks can be deceiving. 

After my first bite, I was surprised with how flavorful the food was.  I can't name all the dishes I tried, so I will name a few.  The butter chicken, naan and chicken curry was very good.  

The place is great if you are looking for an Indian buffet.  

I grade them a solid C.  I was satisfied."}
{"text":"Love this place enough to give it 5 Stars despite a slight on again off again language barrier  w/ the gentleman who has always greeted us kindly and seated us at the same table, each of the 6 or 7 times we've been here (a barrier which mostly comes into play when I say HOT and he insists MILD).  

Only done the buffet once, but it was affordable and I was pretty surprised at the variety they offered and how well marked it was, especially when it came to vegetarian vs non-vegetarian dishes.  

Not sure what everyone is complaining about, re: the service (that goes for my boyfriend, as well).  If you've been to anything other than buffet hour dining, you know the service at Indian restaurants is somewhat relaxed, and this place is no different.  The aforementioned gentleman takes your order and then leaves you to your party.  He's never failed to keep our waters full, and despite making themselves more scarce than traditionally bothersome American servers, he and/or the demure lady (who brings our steamy, delicious food in a timely manner) always have a watchful eye on the dining room.  

Only very slightly pricey, one could judge the portions of some things small, I guess, but not the main dishes.  There is always more than half left over, despite that we're two bearded bear-types w/ voracious appetites.  Mango lassi is pretty good.  Food is great.  

Wheelchair friendly w/ accessible parking on the east side of the building. 

Please keep this place in business."}
{"text":"Conveniently located near I-17 and Bell, easy access from anywhere in the valley.

Lunch buffet is only $9.99 with so many selection. Everything I tried is good so far. I can't remember which food was what...  

They also offer mango nectar juice and hot chai tea. Drinks go well with spicy curry dish, helps me cool down after eating hot and spicy food.

Desert wasn't my favorite.  Too sweet and not much of flavor.. Just typical Indian desert.

Overall, great value for the amount of food they offer, and all the hot dishes I tried was very good."}
{"text":"Is this a north Indian place? A south Indian place? A Pakistani / halal place? I'm not sure. It's trying to hit all the bases at once, and succeeds only marginally in any direction. The lunch buffet, with its bewildering array of regional specialties, reflects this. The day I was there, it had six meat options, but only one vegetable (!). Chai tea and mango lassi were served complimentary with the meal. 

I did enjoy the moru kuzhambu (a spicy south Indian yogurt gravy), but found most other dishes to be just blah, such as the curd rice, idlies, egg masala, and pongal. Dessert offerings were bewilderingly plentiful (ten options, not including the aforementioned mango lassi and chai) but, as with the mains, most were rather lackluster in flavor. 

Bottom line: If you want exposure to a variety of Indian dishes, you enjoy meat, and you live in the north or west valley, give this place a try. For us, we won't bother driving across town when we've got Madras Ananda Bhavan much closer."}
{"text":"I guess all good things will have to end... Boo Hoo..
Like it is being the trend with Indian Restaurants in Phoenix, the original owners appear to have sold this place after they built up a customer base. I went to the buffet last Saturday, it was no good. Everything was too salty, and the Biriyani was dry, the dessert had gone bad. Will not go back there again."}
{"text":"This used to be an old Black Bear Diner and the fact that they still have some of the decor throws me off. We used to come to BBD back in the day at this exact location.

The food itself isn't bad. I ordered chicken tikka masala mild because much as I love spice, my stomach makes me pay for it days later. Better safe than sorry!

Their chicken tikka masala isn't laden with sugar like other places. In fact, it's the opposite. Tons of fenugreek and methi in it makes it almost sour/bitter, but still in a good way. 

Portions are HUGE for what I normally get in a lot of Indian restaurants and prices are proportionate to serving -- thank you so much for that. I wasn't a fan of their Onion Kulcha because it had a slightly bitter taste that didn't go well with my CTM, but on its own, it was fabulous. It was also piping hot - that's hard to find in a lot of places.

I'd come back and try their buffet."}
{"text":"This was our second time and we continued to be impressed with the service and taste."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly atmosphere!
The food was authentic and delicious.  If you like heat in your food,  this is the place to go.
We had the buffet and the choices were many. There was an array of entrees, a salad bar, desserts and Indian breads
The Indian music was a delightful addition to the dining experience."}
{"text":"In Short :
Would definitely recommend their \"Weekend\" Lunch Buffet.
Nice Ambiance. Dinner (A La Catre) orders takes forever to reach your table. 

Details :
Visited this place may times for both Lunch Buffets and for Dinner (Year 2013).
The Weekend Lunch Buffets are the best (worth the money). The highlight of the Buffet is the Deserts(Sweets) Menu. They have a huge variety of Sweets.
They also have Mango Lassi for buffets. The other items are similar to other Indian Buffets around the city.

Been to dinner a few times, and every time they took more than 40 minutes to prepare the order. The take out order took 50 minutes. :-/
The taste was good. Some of the dishes I tried are Lamb curry, Butter Chicken with Garlic Naan.

The Ambiance is good (intimate), not much of noise (except when there are kids)."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant for a buffet.. Weekdays are cheaper and the menu is really good.. The quality of the food is also good.. A must stop by place.."}
{"text":"Really good lunch buffet with many southern indian dishes.  Great naan bread. Every dish was well above average for indian buffets.  Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I don't think this restaurant deserves any rating but since I have to rate I'll give one. The food was undercooked. The taste was horrible except for few items...To list a few items... The batter was coming out of \"Bonda\"...\"Halwa\" was smelling."}
{"text":"Wednesday night around 8pm
Quiet. 3 other tables.
Smells good. Place is a little shoddy with ripped vinyl seats.
It's OK, I go for the food.

Pros:

Vegetable samosa to start. Good.


I had the chicken chetti nadu.  Delicious, spicy, great authentic flavors, chunks of chicken, lots of hot peppers in the dish, which I normally eat, but the spice was pretty hot, so I refrained or would have scorched my taste buds and not tasted anything else for a day or so.

Basmati rice good.

Plain naan. Awesome!!

Con's:

Husband had chicken vindaloo. Not good. Don't add crushed red pepper flakes that you sprinkle on pizza to make it spicy. Either you make a vindaloo sauce or you don't. This was more like marinara sauce with tons of hot pepper flakes. That's not vindaloo.  Although we may appear as vanilla Americans, we are well internationally traveled and foodies. Been cooking Indian food for 21 years. 

Small portions for the money.

I see raves about the buffet and I would try this place again.

Good luck everyone!"}
{"text":"Awesome place and excellent food. Third time here and never disappointed. Everyone should try paneer butter masala"}
{"text":"Mango lassi was truly refreshing, sweet and delicious.
Garlic Naan bread was enjoyable, goes great with the entree as they are sauce like and great for dipping.
Palak paneer was creamy and mild. While subtle it was still a great choice.
Paneer Tikka Masala, spicy but packed with flavor. These dishes went great over bismatti rice as most indian dishes do. Upkeep on the place was marginal but I'm not nibbling on the drapes or sucking on the table cloth. Water tasted fine, which is important, I drink a lot of water when out for indian."}
{"text":"Not sure what I was expecting when I came here, but I was pleasantly surprised.lol. That can sum up my review in one sentence!

Well we ordered a Groupon for Mayuri and decided to use it on Saturday night around 9pm. Was really craving some good chicken curry. When we came through the doors we found out that this place was more of a Buffet..hmm I don't really like buffets but we did it anyways.  But you know, I actually liked it. I made a plate of rice with butter chicken and nan bread. I tried a few other items but really fell for the butter chicken. Was well worth it."}
{"text":"Best Indian Food!!! Kadhai Chicken, Dosas, Chicken 65, Naan, Mango Lassi.. everything is delicious.."}
{"text":"Mayuri Palace does buffet well. Chicken and Goat dishes are good but vegetarian is very mediocre. They used to serve free dosa during lunch buffet but not anymore. The biryani in the lunch buffet is OK; its not authentic but it isn't too bad either. The buffet usually tries to accommodate an Indo-Chinese dish and it always turns out bad. 

Some of my friends have been here for dinner on weekdays and they didn't have any good things to say about the food. One constant complaint was inconsistency - you just can't enjoy the same thing again. 

I would suggest eating at the buffet only on Fridays or weekends. The spread on weekdays isn't that great."}
{"text":"We've read that this place was a good stop.  When we pulled into the parking lot at lunch time there was but one car.  The building and street front left much to be desired and the weeds and dead grass needed to be cut back.  The restaurant is housed inside of what appears to be an old Black Bear Diner based on interior decor, and could use a makeover from top to bottom. They were only offering buffet type dining and bravely we decided to give it a go.  The masala dishes and steamed rice were good but there were several things that we wouldnt try, even the mango lasse was warm and sour.  We won't be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is my favorite indian restaurant in phx. I have tried a lot but Wooooow this place always seems to do it right!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times. In the beginning it was okay, but seems like its going down hill. The owner is rude. I came in a party of two twice and he didn't even greet us once but was taking orders personally from another party of 6. Wouldn't hurt to say hi or ask how the food is if you're walking by and making eye contact with us.

Anyways, as per food, I have had malai kofta, Matar paneer and saag paneer here. Never get the saag paneer here, have a feeling they use frozen spinach. Of the three veggie dishes, I'd say malai kofta is your best bet. It used to be really good and have a nutty flavor but now they put more cream to give it a rich gravy texture but it takes away from the flavor and honestly makes me feel gross after I'm done eating 3/4 of my meal. If you really like the intense flavor of garlic, then get the garlic naan (I don't). I went for plain naan instead.

Place is clean and spacious with plenty parking. Service is fast so I will give them a star for that. Hopefully the owner is nicer to you :)"}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon. Sure, the décor was not that great, but the food and service was really good. I found the servers to be pleasant and attentive. We each had a chicken dish. The TIka Masala and Vindaloo were tasty.

The prices seemed reasonable. I would probably return, however the Groupon was what got us there. I would say it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Wanted p to stop by a couple times ... couldn't tell if they were open they usually park on one side of building.   I had the lunch buffet ...great!  I will stop again to check out more items on menu...."}
{"text":"We love to try new places and always looking for a great Indian restaurant since there are not many in the valley.  Tried this place through a Groupon yet probably won't come back. 
When we arrived for dinner, we were told only the buffet would be available due to some prior catering commitments the restaurant had. We decided to stay although disappointed we would be limited to the buffet offerings. 
The buffet itself was not too bad. Popular Indian items offered yet mimosas were not, which is was what we really wanted to try. 
Since it was a buffet, we did get lots of food for the price, which was very reasonable. 
The place itself looked a bit neglected in that food stains were seen on the drapes and the prior establishment's interior designs and style was reused. (Photos of black bears not seem to be part of an Indian restaurant motif). 
Service was a bit spotty in that we needed to flag the waitress down for water refills and napkins. 
Although the food was decent (for what was offered) we will most likely not return."}
{"text":"One of the worse places for Indian food. Manager is very Arrogant . Never order a vegetarian or Eggeterian dish if you do not eat meat / chicken do not order anything here. You are sure to find chicken pieces bones in veggie dishes / Biryani. Manager is averse to take the feedback and brags about being the only Indian restaurant of this size around this area and apparently is the owner of the restaurant too.."}
{"text":"Wow. Where to start? FANTASTIC!!

We ordered the Lamb Saag medium which was creamy, full of mouth watering spices, and cooked to perfection. We also ordered the chicken masala, also creamy goodness. To accompany our meal we had garlic naan and aloo bread. It was absolutely delicious. 

Very friendly service, wonderful atmosphere, and excellent prices. We will return!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service! Everything here is great!! You have to try the manchuri, it's awesome. :)"}
{"text":"The staff at Mayuri Palace are very friendly here and they always efficiently meet our needs. Many of the staff were here when it was open under a different name so we were happy they remained with the new owners. I come here with just my daughter often and have also been with a group and we have always been well taken care of. 

The place is always clean throughout. The dining room, restrooms and the kitchen, which you can see into from the dining area. I appreciate that the a/c is nice and cool in the summer to keep everyone comfortable. 

The décor is simple, money has not been wasted here. There is Indian music playing in the background, which adds nicely to the ambience. I like that I'm not overwhelmed with TV's hanging from the ceiling blaring distracting videos while I'm trying to eat. 

Since the new owners took over this restaurant the food went from okay to amazing! It has a touch more spice to it than before and there are several new items on the menu, of which my favorite is the Mayuri Special Veg Thali. If I eat here for dinner I order this because it comes with several different items to enjoy: sambar, rasam, 3 South Indian curries, 2 North Indian curries, rice, pickle, pappadum, yoghurt dessert and bread. The pickle stuff is a little too sour for my taste buds, but I love everything else.  My daughter's favorite dish here is the Paneer Butter Masala... and I agree that it is extremely delicious.

Last night we ordered appetizers that we had not previously tried and I would definitely recommend them. My husband and friends loved the Chicken 65, which is boneless chicken cubes marinated in South Indian style spices and deep fried. There were fresh sliced jalapeno peppers throughout adding to the spiciness of this dish. My daughter and I (vegetarians) had the Chilli Paneer appetizer, which is pan fried spicy indian cottage cheese cubes. I promise, it's much better than it sounds! There are perfectly cooked, delicious chunks of onions and bell peppers marinated in sauce mixed in with the fried cheese cubes. And what's not to love about friend cheese?

I still prefer to eat here for the lunch buffet because I enjoy tasting ALL the vegan and vegetarian dishes. They have a great assortment of items out at any given time, both vegan and non-vegatarian. It's perfectly fine with me that they now charge what the other 2 Indian restaurants a block away are charging for their lunch buffet because it's about all about quality. You can't have the best quality food at prices that don't pay to keep the doors open. I am happy to pay a couple dollars more for great food. 

I am not a desert eater and Indian deserts are no exception. I have tasted several at numerous Indian restaurants and I just don't care for them; they're too sweet, greasy and very heavy. I'm more of a fresh-piece-off-fruit-girl if ever I have a need for something sweet, but that's my personal preference. 

We travel 25 miles each way to eat here for dinner and whenever we're in the area during lunch we stop in for the amazing buffet. I definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"So my cousin's have been telling me about this place before I even moved to AZ. Guess since I'm half Punjabi and grew up eating Indian food they were excited to take me here.. They hit it home!! All dishes have the authentic flavor and spice I'm used to. The environment wouldn't tell you, but the food is what explodes."}
{"text":"They have a lunch buffet & menu. The restaurant used to be the old Black Bear Diner about 5 years ago. This restaurant features north and South Indian food with South being spicier. Friendly staff and nice place! Yummy curry smell when you walk in and the vegan choices are very delicious. Plus they officer soup and a choice of chutney. Good tasting sweet mango drink."}
{"text":"I'm a person who goes to buffet on every weekend and I've been to almost all the restaurants including Indian Paradise 2, which was Mayuri's earlier name. I dont know where to start - The stale starters, the tasteless curries, lots of water poured into sambar just to increase the quantity, the chicken biryani which was smelling awfully horrible, not to mention the insipid, overly colored Gajar halwa (I thought they mixed Henna in it). And, as expected, food poisoning at the end of the day. To make matters worse, the owner said that this is mayuri's STANDARD and you can leave if you would like to. The food, the customer service, the owner's attitude sucks to the core- I wish there was a 0 star here."}
{"text":"I have noticed that there are a grip of Indian restaurants around where I work.  I wanted to expand my horizons and try some out.  I had only had Indian food one time.  My mom was a 2nd grade teacher and she had a student named Smith Sirisikorn.  He was of Indian decent and his parents took us out to dinner one night.  I remember not really liking anything and the only thing I really ate was the bread (naan).  Fast forward 20+ years and I decided to try some out today.  I got in my car and made a left on Bell Rd and wound up here.  There are multiple ones in the area, this is the one I landed at!

I walked in and was greeted by a gentleman.  I told him I wanted the buffet and he guided me towards a table.  There were a few other people in the joint, I was the only white guy...nothing wrong with that, just an observation ;-).  I got up and went over to the buffet area.  I grabbed a plate and started piling stuff on to it.  Here are some of the things I got.

Goat Curry-  Um...interesting?  Had lots of bones in it and not much meat.  I only sampled a little of this.

Paneer Tika Masala-  I thought I grabbed chicken, but when I bit in, it was definitely something different.  Turns out that Paneer is an Indian cottage cheese.  Who knew?  Reminded me of tofu kind of and was decent.

Chicken Curry-  This was in a brownish sauce with lots of pieces of chicken.  I did get one small bone in one of the pieces of chicken.  If I hadn't picked through each bite, that would have been a bitch to swallow and choke on.  Thank goodness I found it.

Chicken Tika Masala-  I went back and got some of this.  It was better than the Paneer stuff and was probably my 2nd favorite meat dish I had.  It was in a flavorful tomato type gravy.  Most of this food looks like a babys poo, but once you get past that fact of how it looks, it was actually not bad.  I had a lot of this stuff.

Tandoori Chicken-  This was my favorite thing I had....I should have just stocked up on this and gone to town.  Bright red chicken, cooked perfectly.  It was chicken thighs from what I could tell.  It was delicious!   

Butter Naan-  I loved this bread!  Reminded me of a thin crust pizza dough.  It was delicious!  I ate a bunch of it and used it to dip in the curry/masala sauces.

Rice- Plain white rice and also some Chicken Biryani which is like a fried rice sort of?  Both were just ok.  I kept expecting something like Chinese style rice but this was different.  Wasn't bad, just wasn't great either.  Really dry.

Um...that was about it.  The buffet was $9.99 and the choices were plentiful.  I don't know if I will be back though.  I just didn't really like all the spices/flavoring of most things.  It just wasn't for me.  If you like Indian food though, you will probably love this place and be in Indian food heaven.  If I ever do come back, I will stick to the naan and tandoori chicken.  Those were both fantastic!  I'm glad I tried it though.  I'm usually a simple man and know exactly what I like and am loyal to my preferences.  I'm glad I got out of my comfort zone though and tried some new food!"}
{"text":"Don't ever try \"LUNCH BUFFET\" here, the worst kind of lunch buffet in Phoenix as we had experienced it twice, the uncooked half boiled rice in (so called )biryani with a very pathetic flavor, the mango lassi is contaminated with artificial color, chicken and other dishes seems to run out of supply with left over bits and pices of mutton, so as the chicken dishes only gravy with few pieces of chicken. This place is also WORST with a very limited choice of items in the buffet and the worst part is the staff or the restaurant manager don't even bother about the satisfaction of the customer and showing an attitude of not improving their quality atleast in the near future that much is guranteed... its an utter waste of money, waste of time and above all end up with a bad mood...total ruin of our weekend lunchDon't ever try \"LUNCH BUFFET\" here, the worst kind of lunch buffet in Phoenix as we had experienced it twice, the uncooked half boiled rice in (so called )biryani with a very pathetic flavor, the mango lassi is contaminated with artificial color, chicken and other dishes seems to run out of supply with left over bits and pices of mutton, so as the chicken dishes only gravy with few pieces of chicken.

{"text":"Our most recent visit will probably be our last... The place was filthy, and my husband saw a roach... We've loved this place for ever, but it's really gone downhill...."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our first visit to this restaurant.  Service was great, no other customers were there at the time.  I had the Vegetable Kurma which was served with white rice.  It was really good.  My husband had the Lamb Rogan Josh and he said it was delicious as well.  The Garlic Naan was excellent.  The place appeared clean.  We did not see any cockroaches.  Hopefully they have taken care of that problem."}
{"text":"Even though I don't care to go to Indian buffets it sure does seem I review more than a fair share?  :)   By the way, I love Indian food, Pakistan food, Mediterranean food, etc., I just don't care to eat buffet restaurants because the food is usually a lot less spicy and doesn't have as good of a taste when you order off a menu.

Mayuri Palace is one that I have found I can return to.  So I now have two locations in the valley (Phoenix area) that I will return to for their buffet.  One near ASU and one in North Phoenix.  

Their buffet has plenty of choices.  Their Chili Chicken was great, just the right spice and surprisingly hotter than I thought, even though I could have handled hotter.  However, it was just right.  The Chicken Tikka Masala had great flavors, not so spicy but over all great taste.  I don't knock them for spice since this is a buffet and they have to cater to those with tongues that can't handle true spices. 

The biriyani Chicken again was great. 

Service was good, the place was clean.  I have been here many times and unlike some of the 1 star ratings have never seen a roach anywhere in that building... well at least the dinning room floor."}
{"text":"My wife and son and I had dinner last Sunday at Mayuri.  The place was not real full.  It did fill up later.  I hope it does well because the food is good.  The service is good and the prices quite reasonable.  We had three entrees and all were good.  I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Found this place through Groupon.  It looked fine inside, and the staff was attentive.  The man who I am assuming was the owner was a little pushy when it came to ordering - he tried to upsell everything, and not in a very low-key way.  

\"Can I have some plain Naan?\"  \"Two orders garlic Naan?\"  \"Um - no - on order - regular Naan.\"   

While the decor is nice from far away, when you get up close to the curtains along the wall next to the booths, you can see the previous diners have left smears of their food on the curtains.  That was not so good.

BUT - the food was VERY tasty.  My partner is a vegetarian and there were many options for him to choose from.  I was torn between Lamb Makhani (which I loved) and Biryani (which I want to go back for).  

Honestly - was it my favorite Indian I've had in Phoenix?  No.  Was it bad?  No.  But as you walked around you saw what looked like a failing business.  Huge restaurant - mostly empty - bathrooms in disrepair - decor dirty/stained - etc.  

I have no fault with the food, but we aren't sure we want to go back for dine-in.  Carry-out?  We could do that."}
{"text":"We worked up a sweat at the nearby Phoenix Badminton Center, Deer Valley yesterday. So after 3 1/2 hours of batting it around my pals and I decided to feed our faces at the MP Indian Buffet/restaurant again.

The variety of veg./ non veg. North& South Indian cuisine is pretty nice and unusual. The service was attentive as always and we settled right in after piling our plates high.
The soups, rice dishes, appetizers, bondas, Vadas, samosas, hot naan bread and tons of other delicious chicken tikka masala and fish called for several plates and bowls in attendance on our table. Desserts offer variety and drink the mango lassi,ya.

Now we contemplated either a nap back at the Center (feasible in their comfy lounge) or to bat the birdie around and work off the lunch and decided on the latter.
The Mayuri Palace is located blocks from the I-17 fwy./Bell across from a Fiat dealer and easy to get in and out from.             Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a Groupon offer and the first thing you notice is that this restaurant does not look Indian at all. It has a log cabin-y feel and there were pictures of bears on the glass window. That's when you realize that this used to be a Black Bear restaurant and they haven't bothered to change it. The furnishings just looked old and dated. 

We ordered the garlic naan, chicken saag, and mutter paneer. Naan was pretty standard and as always, a great vehicle for their sauces. Chicken saag was average, a bit too salty for my liking. The mutter paneer wasn't bad, but wasn't spectacular either. Prices were a bit high without a Groupon. Overall, a pretty mediocre experience and I probably won't be coming back unless I happen to be in the area and have a Groupon."}
{"text":"Had dinner early here on a Friday. Only one other person there. Food was great, had the curry fish mild, and the lamb with onions and green bell pepper. The latter was so delicious.

Service was slow, same like last time. Got menu, waited and waited, finally went to counter to order. Meal came and a pitcher of ice water left at tree table which was great because waitress didn't check back. 

Upon finishing meal, had to go to counter to get a to go box and the bill. 

All odd for service since there was literally one other customer there at the time.

Recommend going to the lunch buffet where you serve yourself.

Closed Mondays."}
{"text":"Daytime visit and it looked a bit sketchy from the outside and was a bit nervous parking in the back of the building.  Inside didn't seem to be renovated much from whatever restaurant was there before.  Staff was polite.  Buffet was reasonably priced and had numerous options, with quite a few being Indian dishes that are uncommon at other buffets in town.  Dosa was just just ok, as was the Naan.   The fried appetizers were not very fresh and some of the buffet area was a little messy.   Place was very busy and filled with native Indian customers, which is a very good sign in my book."}
{"text":"Well the lunch buffet is good on Fridays but a bit pricey if you ask me. 12 to 13 dollars plus drinks per person is a little too much for a Friday afternoon lunch.  There is a significant difference in the buffet based upon the day of the week you go so I would not recommend going on any other weekday except Friday. The food is pretty decent but I feel the price is unjustified for Indian lunch buffets. The same spread would cost be 5.95 to 7.95 tops on the east coast so I am a little baffled by the 10 to 12 dollar buffets in Phoenix serving a much smaller spread. As all Indian restaurants around the valley, they are really good initially when they start but as time progresses the quality of food and service deteriorates."}
