{"text":"I went to E2 recently when I visited Pittsburgh. It was highly rated by friends, however, I found it disappointing overall.  The donuts were less than satisfactory despite the fact that they had my favorite taste combination, chocolate/espresso. My maple mush was an odd assortment of polenta, bacon, and non-maple syrup. My wife had something different but was similarly underwhelmed. Clearly I would not recommend."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to go here for Sunday brunch. Let me tell you, the annoyingly long wait was worth it. The food was fantastic! Especially the donuts and zeppolis. We will definitely return!!! They should consider taking reservations or call aheads or even use the huge room in the basement to seat people."}
{"text":"Best Italian in the city of Pittsburgh!  Very authentic!  Had the spicy penne and was absolutely outstanding.  Wonderful customer service!  BYOB a plus!  What a find!"}
{"text":"The first time at E2 but definitely not the last.

The atmosphere is superb--a genuine feeling of a Fiorentine taverna. A warm, kind, and colorful energy in the air, as if all of those colorful dishes, the aromas coming from the kitchen, and the friendliness and laid-backness of the staff merged together in a giddy and delicious cloud.

I was put in such a good mood right from the start just from that vibe itself. The food was good, though I must admit that the special--salmon on orecchiette was not the best combination. My boyfriend had wild mushroom ravioli which he said was delicious. The other two friends had also the salmon orecchiette special and an appetizer. We also had some of the cheeses--the Spanish smoked cheese matched perfectly the sweetness of the beet salad with dill.

We split a rhubarb crostata a la mode, and that was wonderful. They don't have espresso (which is really strange for an Italian restaurant) but the coffee was great. They also did not have milk, just half and half.

The only problem I had was with my main dish--the salmon orecchiette special. It definitely lacked some things and had too much of others. It needed much more cream and much more parmesan in the cheese sauce. Then, there was bacon in the sauce, which would have been fine in a different pasta combo, but not in a salmon dish. The green sprouts were too bitter to go well with the subtle taste of the salmon. If it were after me, I would have taken out the sprouts and added instead some slightly roasted finely chopped fennel (and stay away from putting bacon in the sauce, but rather add more cream and parmesan).

All in all, I loved the place and I am definitely planning to return. But for a different dish,  for sure!"}
{"text":"E2 is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. The staff is friendly and the food is amazing. You will not be disappointed. The dining room is small so be sure to call ahead."}
{"text":"I've gone to E2 about 3 times now and I think it's time for a review after our last visit, in which we celebrated our friend's birthday. 

Dinner at E2 is wonderful. It's new and exciting, yet familiar too. It's exactly what Highland Park needed...and Pittsburgh, too! 

The atmosphere is cozy, relaxed and unpretentious. There is NO typical tacky Italian restaurant decor. It's simple and lovely...especially if you get to dine outside. 

The staff is awesome! Everyone is super friendly, happy and helpful! They pretty much became our bffs in one night. 

The food is...well...simply delicious. It's how you never realized Italian/American food should taste. Nothing is over done, nothing is \"too much\" or \"too little.\" The menu changes daily and stays seasonal and local. Needless to say, the food is fresh! The emphasis on using seasonal and locally derived ingredients is so, so important and E2 poses the question \"Why can't all restaurants do this?\" 

From the pumpkin tortellini to the ox tail, the menu offers a variety of vegetarian, meat and seafood options all executed creatively, but never over the top. Chef Kate Romane does an excellent job of reminding you how food is supposed to taste: fresh and exciting, yet comforting and satisfying. 

The portions range from tapas to family style. All of which is perfect for having a family-like group of friends to dine with (as we did)! We had a chef's sampling of almost everything on the menu. As we passed the plates around, we discussed and dissected each bite, mesmerized by the high quality of food and preparation, succumbing to the comfortable, familial magic of E2. 

Oh, how could I forget, E2 is BYOB, And boy, did we BYO... but that didn't seem to bother the staff, rather they seemed to encourage it. 

So, hours later, we slowly pulled ourselves together, said good bye to our new friends and, almost unwillingly, left E2. It was like leaving Grandma's house... a place you have fond memories of and a place you know you'll continue to make fond memories for years to come. And like at any grandma's house, at E2, you're sure to have a perfectly delicious, carefully prepared, heart warming meal in a cozy environment perfect for sharing laughs creating memories with your family...and your extended family you have yet to meet."}
{"text":"First time eating at E2 and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised. Started off with the Porcini Cappelletti and it was very good! My only complaint is that I paid extra money for chicken and only received a chicken nugget worth of chicken in my pasta. Not sure if it was because the restaurant was busy and my order was takeout..... but I was much better off ordering the dish without it. Luckily, I also purchased dessert. The walnut cake with berry sauce was DIVINE (pictured below) and made up for my chicken pasta with no chicken. Will be back but will dine in instead of takeout."}
{"text":"Late Wednesday dinner (just after 9pm) and E2 was quiet, but nonetheless lovely. The dining room was small, with a few bookcases in the front, a chalkboard menu in the back, and a small front patio. Plentiful water and grilled and oiled bread for the table. Started with fried squash blossoms with a chile creme fraiche - and wild mushroom ravioli for the main. Attentive, kind service and a nice, but unpretentious atmosphere. Worth repeat visits."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful brunch with friends. The doughnuts were a meal in themselves -- with berry mess. Everything was great -- the hash, patata, omelets, the servers, even the coffee. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This place was really only mediocre. My girlfriend and I enjoyed the appetizers, (we had the asparagus), but neither of us were crazy about our main dish. She had the polenta, which was overcooked, and I had pasta with sausage that was dry. 

Nice atmosphere, great service, boring food."}
{"text":"I wish that I could find fault with this place but I can't.  Good cheese, salads, entrees, dessert, and coffee.  Waiter was very helpful and attentive without being annoying.  Like the BYOB too.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Restaurant with an eclectic personality, and staff that know and care about the quality of food and service that they provide. Their homemade donuts are literally to die for- the bacon and maple donut was even surprisingly delicious. And then there's their breakfast items... let's just say you can't go wrong with any of the dishes... all local, fresh foods and bursting with flavor. Definitely go here for brunch... your stomach will thank you. 

Just a heads up, cash only and  BYOB."}
{"text":"I tried to eat here yesterday for brunch.  I've been to E2 once before and the food is good.  Brunch is served until 2 pm on weekends.  We arrived at 1 pm and were informed that the restaurant was now closed for the day.  The hostess was quite condescending and didn't really explain why they were closing an hour early.  My assumption is that the restaurant is very small and there were a lot of people who had put names in ahead of us.  It was really very weird, however. They don't answer their phone and don't have a way to contact them on their website.  It seems that they aren't interested in customer feedback.  I doubt I will bother going back."}
{"text":"Small cozy seating area. Black chalkboard table. Homemade focaccia bread. Overall good coma inducing. Came here for breakfast with a friend and got absolutely food wasted. We were the first people in the joint at 9:30-apparently because people stay in when it rains (totally valid). Started with the special donuts - lemon curd and whip. DELICIOUS! They are a bit denser than your regular donut holes, but they have a bit of a crunch on the outside and a soft cakey center. The lemon curd was on point and melted into the warm donuts! Then I had the patatas bravas. So great - had a generous side salad and delicious spicy aioli sauce. Friend had the French toast and was totally defeated by it - 4 huge slices of the thick and dense homemade focaccia bread doused in apples, mascarpone, and whip cream. Overall great time and great service. E2, we concede delicious defeat!"}
{"text":"I like this place. The food was good and is ever changing. I guess that could be a good thing or a bad thing. I had banana bread pudding it was good, quite sweet. My girl had poached eggs with roasted tomatoes. She said it was \"very savory and flavors well together\" ha ha. We will be back to try more of the menu. Nice addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"definitely always yummy. the food is simple and well crafted. brunch is always a long wait so we don't really do that any more. but dinner is super tasty. the corkage fees are a little high as i think they are per person. But grilled bread, yummy salad and gooey eggs are always in fashion here at E2 and in my book."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in pgh. My husband and I pride ourselves on being foodies and the food here is some of the best we've had in the city when it comes to authentic Italian.  The service is excellent and welcoming. Sadly.. they don't take reservations for parties under 6...but you can open your bottle of wine and have a drink downstairs while you wait for your table to be ready!  I highly recommend the gorgenzola mess for an appetizer...delicious!"}
{"text":"I recently went here with Boyfriend and lovely friend A after a long debaucherous (sure, that's a word) night and we were really looking for some Saturday brunch to revive us.  We sat inside but right near the open door to the patio so there was a nice breeze.  I had iced coffee which was just fine - nothing special.  We started with the bag o' doughnuts which were very good!  Crispy and light.  I wish they weren't out of the beignet (but I got to have some the next day at Sunday Brunch at Avenue B - hey I really like brunch, ok??) 

I wish I had gotten the bread pudding that A suggested (before we left it was wiped off the chalkboard menu - I bet it was delicious!) but I was in the mood for something savory and got the frittata.  It had sauteed greens, mushrooms, mozzarella, and tomatoes (I think?) it was also fine but not very flavorful or fluffy.  It came with a salad which was delicious and fresh.  A's brioche and fruit and cheese looked much better than mine as did Boyfriends' eggs.  Oh but the side of bacon was SO good - thick and meaty and crispy - GREAT bacon.  Maybe I'd bump it up half a star just for the bacon.  The potatoes were also really good - not overdone as many brunch potatoes are.

It's a nice little place to grab some brunch - it was within walking distance of the house so that was a bonus.  If you have a lot of people you might have trouble getting seated because it's pretty small.  The prices were pretty good for a nice brunch, nothing over $12 and all the starters are $5.  Nice patio, quiet neighborhood people watching - it definitely cured my ills and I'd go back again but probably would go for the bread pudding!"}
{"text":"A great vibe, tasty menu with lots of rich flavors, and a donut menu!? Their taters/maters/beans are surprisingly decadent, and their french toast is drenched in blueberry sauce and goat cheese.

Definitely the most unique part is the donuts, and they have about 10 crazy flavors (we got a pepper corn parmesan that was delicious, and nice to slather our eggs onto). 

Saturday brunch is less crowded than sunday. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Friends had been trying to get us on a Highland Park \"brunch and pastry crawl\" for weeks.We started the morning at E2.  A great choice.

My husband and I arrived first and were seated right away on the front patio.  It felt very European sitting in the sun, sipping coffee, and watching the people line up next door at Food Glorious Food.
The waiter was knowledgeable and understanding when our friends were late. 

I had a fabulous fig bread pudding with goat cheese. My husband was slightly less interested in his choice: a brioche with truffle honey and Camembert.  He said the brioche was a little tasteless and doused with too much honey. But overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Love E2 for their local/organic food but was underwhelmed by brunch after reading the rave reviews. The food was bland and just \"OK\". For me, not worth the trip out to Highland Park. For reference: I travel frequently, maintain a healthy diet, love food, and eat out about 4 times/week."}
{"text":"We had a lovely time at E2! Excellent food, very small venue that encourages friends to carry on as though it were a dinner party in their own home. Friendly staff and BYOB is always appreciated. I'd love to go back as their menu changes seasonally."}
{"text":"Incredible service and food! 
I booked E2's family style tasting menu ($35 a person, waives corkage fee) for a friend's birthday dinner in January. The 8 of us arrived, and E2, immediately brought us bread, followed by huge platters of antipasto, two great salads, and then 4-5 different entrees and pasta options. They even brought the vegetarian a special dish, at no additional charge, which was also large enough to share. The menu also included dessert, and our waiter brought a brownie with a lit candle for the bday girl (so nice, and not requested). All of the servers were fabulous, as was the chef who came out to ask how everything was. We had so much food, everyone took home doggy bags. I will definitely return and LOVED the family style tasting menu and will use it when I have a big group that wants great food and service."}
{"text":"I've lived in Highland Park for a couple of months now, and heard some good things about E2. I was finally able to check it out this weekend for brunch, and I was very impressed!
The menu is written on a chalkboard inside the restaurant, and since we ate outside, it was a little awkward standing up and peering inside at the menu. But, whatever, it was well worth it for the food that we got!
I ordered the \"Mush\"-- weird name, but delicious! It was a piece of polenta topped with pecans, sausage, pecan, and a wonderful sticky maple-y caramel-y sauce, and a couple slices of toast (the bread may have been homemade, though I'm not sure). Soooo good!
I though the service was fine-- prompt and professional. No complaints about it. It seems that their menu changes frequently, so I will definite return to try something else!"}
{"text":"So this was my first experience here. It was a Friday night and we decided to use the no wait app. The app has worked flawlessly in the past. 

The app said no wait and to come on in. So we did exactly that armed with two bottles of wine. Got a great parking spot. Don't worry there are no meters and lots off street and side street parking. And you can feel safe walking the neighborhood. 

We got there and they were packed and it was about an hour wait. We were not in a hurry so we left the wine and walked down to Park Brugge. 

Had a few drink and the mussels and got the call to come back. 

We sat outside and it was such a nice setting. Would be great date place if you sat outside. 

It was 85 out so after some food and drinks I got a little hot. But that's expected in the middle of summer. No ac inside for relief. 

The severs were awesome and made great recommendations. We had the meats and cheese plater. Great selection of 3 of each. 

The apps were also great. Paired with our wine it was a nice stop. 

I look forward to trying really the entrees."}
{"text":"Don't even consider this place as you're making plans for holiday parties, birthday parties, rehearsal dinners, etc. The event planner will give you a day's notice that she's given your reservation away because she's irresponsible and on top of that, completely rude. The food is great and I love going to small restaurants in Pittsburgh, but if you're treated like garbage, why bother? Piccolo Forno is wonderful, cheap corkage fee, amazing food, and the staff are wonderful. Call them instead."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best meals I've ever had, and absolutely the best breakfast. I had the patatas gratas (I think that's how it was spelled), which was chorizo, potatoes, a creamy aoili, an egg over easy, and a great fresh salad. It was fantastic. The chorizo mix was very spicy, but I like that, and I loved having a salad with breakfast. I'm not the biggest breakfast fan. Well, until E2! My husband had the french toast. It came with whipped cream, chocolate and strawberries. He said it was the best french toast he has ever had, and he is a french toast expert! Due to a mix up, we also got to try the frittata, and it was fantastic.
Ambiance was great. The seating was inside what seemed to be the living room of a house, with the brunch offerings written on a giant blackboard. You are close to your neighbor, but it was never uncomfortable or loud. 
Service was awesome. Really, really lovely servers.
I will definitely be back, and I can't wait to go for dinner!"}
{"text":"What a quaint little place that I never knew existed. Known for brunch, I dined here on Saturday night when they were testing their dinner menu. Overall, a few kinks to work out but I enjoyed my meal, ambiance and the fact that my husband and I had our daughter in tow and no one knew. (She was quiet as a mouse and asleep in her car seat in the corner by our table below the chalkboard of specials.) BYOB. Ingredients sourced from local farms. 

Likes: Starters are called OMGs!, spicy tomato sauce on the ravioli, goat cheese galore (Midnight Moon paired with grilled beats was awesome!), tagliatelle tossed with anchovy, ricotta cream topping on blackberry apple crostada, peppy waitstaff.

Not so much: Bread, a carrier for those cute OMGs, was oh so bland. I overheard someone say it's not supposed to be the star. But it needed something -- salt, at least. Was super excited for walnut tapenade but it was loaded with blue cheese. Hubby said the 2 often go together so ... now I know. Also, the red sauce on the yummy meatballs was not the same delish spicy, fruity sauce on the ravioli. The meat could have handled the spice.

Would definitely recommend, if nothing else than for dessert. In addition to the crostada, the usual goodies from Enrico's are available.  And yes, we pigged out and got the macaroons too."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best brunch spot in the city. The food is fresh, inventive and tasty; The service is competent and friendly; and the location is cute as a button. The little touches - the wine bottles of water on the table, the donut and zeppoli menu, the real maple syrup, the outstanding coffee - put this place head and shoulders above other places in the city. 

Also, they are awesome at providing a couple of veg options, are happy to sub out ingredients and offer both healthy and decadent options...from omlelettes, frittatas and a veggie plate with beans, salad and potatoes, to patatas bravas, foccacia French toast with pear-berry compote, dark chocolate-pistachio donuts and anchovy-stuffed zeppoli... any number of types of eaters would most def. leave this place stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant, conveniently located on Bryant st in Highland Park.... we love the tortellini with prosciutto and peas and cheese with cured hand plates as appetizers. We just heard they closed this located and I'm so so sad !!! Why??? Can someone explain to me why?"}
{"text":"Had brunch here with a friend in April 2014 -- pretty good! I had read about the owner on the website before going and appreciated her philosophy. The service was great when we got there, except that they strangely wouldn't let us have 2 menus. We grabbed one off the neighboring empty table so that we could both look, and the server snapped it back up the moment my friend stood up to find the restroom, and put it back on the neighboring table. One per table I guess.... 

We got lavender lemon donuts, and chocolate pistachio donuts -- quite good, although I really would have preferred more of the sauces/toppings. The ratio of sauce to fried batter was far too low, and some bites of the donut were not that enjoyable. We only ate one of them there, and had 4 each to bring home for later.

We also got a frittata which was really good, lots of fresh veggies and a delicious cheese, and a side salad for even more freshness! They also easily accommodated our request to leave out the tomatoes. 

Our other dish was a french toast, which was actually terrible. It was made with very thick bread, and the interior was completely dry, like stale bread. Yuck! French toast should be moist! We hardly ate any of it. It seemed like a fluke though, as everything else was great and everyone loves this place... so I'll forgive and forget."}
{"text":"Came here on a girls' night. My friend and I arrived carrying a couple of bottles of wine. We were greeted, then asked how many in our party. We let the \"hostess\" know that there were 3 in our party but that our 3rd would be arriving shortly. We were told that all guests in the party needed to be present to be seated, but that they could assure us a table when she did arrive. We looked in the restaurant and there was only 1 table available. So....why couldn't we sit there now? We asked if there was a place to sit in the meantime to have a drink and we were told that we could find a seat downstairs. We went down to find a couple high top tables outside of the bathroom, where there is no service , so we couldn't open our wine to have a drink, let alone have someone bring us a glass to even drink it from. We decided that we felt like we were in timeout so we went upstairs and asked if we could sit at our table if we ordered an appetizer. We were reluctantly told yes. We sat down and when the waitress came, it was clear she knew that we were waiting for a 3rd person. Why was this such a big deal? We ordered an app as promised and our friend arrived 10 mins later. The grilled proscitto appetizer was delicious, the tortellini dish was also very good. We enjoyed the atmosphere (upstairs not downstairs) although it was very loud and hard to hold a conversation. Would I come here again? Eh. Food was good but greeting really turned me off so probably not. There are plenty of places in Pittsburgh with great good that actually make their guests feel welcome. I have since been told that the hostess is most likely the owner who has this sort of attitude."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my dad and fiance.  The food is excellent and the prices are reasonable for a nice restaurant (my dad was visiting from out of town and we wanted to take him someplace special).  I believe the bill was around $70 something for appetizers and 3 entrees.  It is also pretty great that you can bring your own wine.  I plan to come back here for sure."}
{"text":"Did you know E2 has a newly renovated event space downstairs? Well, they do and the non profit that I work for, Union Project, had a happy hour there this past weekend. It was wonderful! The ambiance is perfect and the staff made the event effortless. Lights hang like an abstract constellation from the ceiling casting a warm glow over the space. There is plenty of room to set up tables and a dance floor and is the perfect setting for a birthday party, bachelor/bachelorette party, small reception or happy hour. The food was, in a word, amazing! We were assisted at every step from the initial planning stages to blowing out the candles at the end of the night, it was a wonderful experience. If you have a celebration coming up and you want a place that can make it happen from eats to digs, E2 is your place."}
{"text":"Great pastas, nice service.  Our group had four different pastas (spaghetti and meatballs, gnocchi, cheese ravioli, and the Brussels sprouts carbonara).  All were good, but I will definitely go back (from Philadelphia!) to have that carbonara again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fantastic Saturday brunch at E2, starting with friendly prompt service with immediate coffee from the hostess.  We had the berry white donuts which were warm, sweet, and delicious, and the chorizo and chickpea gravy over a homemade biscuit, which was savory and incredibly tasty.   The atmosphere is cozy and friendly.  We can not wait to return and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Their beignets and doughnuts are the bomb. It has a cozy atmosphere (in the shell of a renovated row-house) so it feels like authentic Pittsburgh but with a metropolitan cuisine that outshines the regular Pittsburgh brunch spots. It's BYOB so it's a great place for a boozy brunch on a budget."}
{"text":"I admit, I was hesitant to go to E2. I thought it would be pretentious and overpriced. I was wrong. So wrong.

It's not a dive, obviously, but you get what you pay for. For a very reasonable price you are treated to some of the highest quality food in the city, prepared by peopel who are incredibly dedicated to their craft. And unlike some hip, contemporary restaurants, you won't leave hungry.

The service I've received at E2 has been very good to absolutely stellar. My server on the last visit was one of the best I've ever encountered. It's impressive how a true professional can enhance your dining experience, even at a high-quality restaurant such as E2.

And the food... I've found myself at a loss for words on several occasions. I don't recall ever leaving a morsel on the plate. I've been exposed to new things, and been impressed by the preparation and presentation of familiar dishes."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for brunch and once for actual dinner. Nothing special. I do appreciate that the restaurant is friendly to vegetarians/vegans comparatively speaking to other restaurants in Pittsburgh, but that's not exactly saying much. I had the doughnuts for brunch and they were delicious, but nothing memorable. I might order them again I suppose (if I'm forced to come here ever again). Our waitress at dinner was very sweet, and she even had a chef prepare me a special vegan pasta dish not listed on the menu. I was excited until it came out soaked with parmesan cheese. I gently reminded the waitress that cheese was not vegan, but to avoid waste of perfectly acceptable food, I ate the dish. I was hoping that it was Parmigiano-Reggiano that saturated my pasta (I do miss eating that parmesan cheese),but alas, it was not. The best thing about my dinner was the burgundy that my date brought as BYOB and the sauternes we drank after we left. Silver lining perhaps?"}
{"text":"Kate & William went above and beyond to accommodate my food allergies. I was coming for a group dinner with an organization I volunteer for and contacted them ahead of time to avoid all the questions once I arrived. They adjusted the recipes since it was a buffet so I could eat everything. The food was very good but my favorite part was the atmosphere - the downstairs room was so gorgeous. I was very pleased and look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Good. Busy. Flavorful. BYOB. 
All things my step dad would say about his game room. 

This place has delightful ingredients and wonderful taste... From farm to fork. Could it be easier? I don't know. I never got my GED. 

I went and was not disappointed being told this place had amazing food, and best of all I could get my eggs like my undercarriage. Drippy. 

E2 has redonk fresh ingredients like Rosemary and Shallots. You can get anything you want here unless you want wild boar, zebra, or a threesome with a hot Mennonite named Steve. Then sorry folks, you gotta take the Amtrak to Lancaster.

The service is great but the food is the major highlight. I have tried everything on the menu twice except brunch's Tony's bag of D's. Cuz fool me once. Everything here is solid and very few things are trendy. If you want an entire menu of gluten free items and a bisexual server with clip on bangs LET ME KNOW cuz the Olive Garden fired Brenda. 

PROS:
Best coffee in Pittsburgh. Seriously. It is the best black thing I have had inside me if I don't count the years between 2003-2008. 

The seats are higher up then Outback Steakhouse. This is awesome because most booth seating tickles my             C-section scar and tends to rub up against the table. 

Cons: 
Brunch is my favorite but it is CASH ONLY. I am just warning you because this was a pro for me. I only pay with cash. The last time I checked my credit score to get a Kohl's charge card the screen just had a picture of a jar full of bee's."}
{"text":"We LOVE E2! They hosted a large dinner for us in their beautiful private space in the basement, and it was a pleasure to work/communicate with them, the food was A+ and everyone loved it, the space was lovely, and the per head cost was very reasonable, especially since it's BYOB (we underestimated the amount of alcohol our guests would consume, and one of the servers went to the beer distributor to pick up more!). They also allowed us to bring in our own dessert. There is no other place in Pittsburgh I would host a large party, and I called about 10 other, similar restaurants in the city during my selection process.

Our brunches have also been great; excellent menu overall, and the beignet menu rules. It's a bummer there aren't reservations, because the very likely chance of a wait is a bummer, but if you have the time, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"I'm confused by the other reviews I read here. We have lived in Highland Park for two months and have already visited E2 four times. It suits us down to the ground.  It is not a formal environment, but the staff are efficient, relaxed, kind and accommodating. The food is not super fancy or complicated but IS exceptional quality (something like turning up to your friend's house who is an excellent cook and has just been to the farmer's market).

  The menu rotates with seasonal produce, and so far seems to have a good range of options for meat eaters and vegetarians.  The prices are really good value considering the quality of the ingredients.  We love E2!!!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner last week with a friend, the place was empty when we arrived at opening, but packed as we left about 2 hours later.  Loved the make yourself antipasti dish--you can choose what you want on your platter from the chalkboard menu on the wall--perfect for those of us who don't want meat on their platter!  We had the gorgonzola mash, dilled green beans and olives, all great--especially the cheese which was mashed with Siracha--loved it!!  I ordered the grilled Romaine and then decided upon beans and greens for my entrée.  I've had grilled Romaine before, and this was ALMOST as good as Pino's (best grilled Romaine ever).  The beans and greens I ordered with an egg on top because the waiter told me it was so awesome.  I was disappointed in two different ways, first--hardly any greens (that's the part I love), and the egg yolk, which the waiter told me would be oozing into the beans/greens, making it heavenly--was fully cooked!  I guess I'm the dummy for not sending it back!  My girlfriend enjoyed her polenta and peppers, and her portion was huge.  

Waiter was very attentive.  I liked the BYOB setting.  The prices are not outrageous.  The place is a bit noisy when packed--as the acoustics are not the greatest.  I may or may not be back."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed by this place. I went as a double date on a Friday night. Tim had been here before and really enjoyed it. I tried to make a reservation, but was told that they only take them for larger parties (6 or more) - and that if I wanted a guaranteed table, I should show up before 7 because there is typically a 45 minute wait.
Harley and Matt arrived slightly before Tim and I and our bottle of wine. However, they were able to easily secure a table. They said the host took a while to appear to seat them and answered the phone a few times before acknowledging them.
There was a ridiculously long wait for water and wine glasses. We didn't even get a bread platter. Our waitress was kind and gave us some recommendations from the menu. Other than that, we did not see her the entire meal until it was time for us to pay. Our food was dropped by the host and a busboy. We refilled our own wine and water. Someone gave us a bag of burnt bread with our entrees. The food was bland and not very good - the guys enjoyed theirs, but Harley and I did not enjoy ours. 
I had the lobster risotto - it was overpowered with chewy lobster. And that is something one would not normally say about a lobster dish. I was starving after finishing my plate and choking down two pieces of charred bread. I ordered beignets for the table, hoping to give e2 a second chance...but the beignets were chewy and bland.
We left very quickly."}
{"text":"My favorite place to head after waking up on a lazy grey skied winter weekend, I enjoy heading to E2 for its fresh style, which is unassuming greatness. Beignets are a great start-don't pass them up. I've had frittata and the mush (deliciously coated with perfect amount of syrupy goodness). Also sampled off friends plates - Mac n cheese was good, stuffed french toast excellent. Gets crowded with wait times so if that annoys you, head in around opening. Service has always been good. Everything made from scratch ciabatta so good, I wanted to buy a loaf (NFS). Twice we weren't able to order first choice - risotto and something with truffles. We were there quite early, so it was a bit surprising to have 12 choices and 2 were unavailable. Still always enjoy this place. So good, you just roll with it."}
{"text":"E2 has a handful of amazing dishes and some good Italian comfort food. On occasion, I've also tasted a so-so dish, but I continue to return to satisfy a few cravings. The appetizers (gorgonzola mess, anything pickled, bread) and brunch (amazing zeppoli - fried dough with parmigiano and pepper, donuts, bread pudding with goat cheese, breakfast sandwich) are best, and the BYOB is a great aspect. In the height of summer tomato season, I once had a delicious and memorable homemade ravioli with fresh tomato sauce. I think E2 excels at keeping large parties happy in the downstairs space with some great salads and appetizers and a create-your-own convivial atmosphere. Overall, a great spot to return to."}
{"text":"I had never even heard of this place before! I went along with a group of alums from my alma mater.  The food was fantastic and you could tell it was fresh.  The space is great! Much of it was built from recycled materials from Construction Junction.  The meatballs were the size of my head.  It took everything in me to keep from eating more than 2.  Please go!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a friday night with three girlfriends. DELICIOUS! 

It's a little pricey, but the food was fantastic. We ordered apps, entrees, desserts and brought wine. There is a cork fee which isn't great, but I wasn't too bothered. My only complaint is that the restaurant closed at 10pm on a Friday night. They let us linger for a bit since we didn't get a table until 8:30 and we brought a lot of wine. We would've stayed longer, but they started cleaning up around us and it felt like we should go. 

The restaurant is cute and cozy, it would be perfect for a date night. I've heard good things about brunch, planning to try it soon!"}
{"text":"Meh. 

Okay, let me start this off by stating that I have an inexorable optimism for healthy options on campus. All I want is something cheap, made with love, that my body will love. I am well aware that, generally speaking, love isn't cheap. So I'm willing to pay the price, if it's worth it. E2 isn't worth it, folks.

My first few experiences at E2 were upwards of 4-5 stars; I stuck with the tofu satay wrap and lemon bar option. As I branched out, I realized that I wasn't getting the bang that I wanted for my hard earned bucks. The southwest succotash is delicious, don't get me wrong! But honestly, I didn't just pay seven dollars for twenty kernels of corn, twelve lima beans, and five spicy poky leaves that feel like hairballs in my throat. I mean, really? I don't want your froo froo leaves taking up 60% my meal space.

I won't be purchasing a meal from E2 again. However, I will die for their lemon bars and chocolate chip cookies. The lemon bars are a moist graham cracker crust layered with gooey lemon and topped off with drizzled white chocolate. For $1.98. Yes. Please. And their chocolate chip cookies? 72% chocolate chip, 28% cookie, easily. My chocolate fix will always be satiated at E2. 

Even through my frustrations with the meal portion to expense ratio, I will return to E2 because my sweet tooth tells me to do so. Lemon bars and chocolate chip cookies that delicious just have to be made with love, right?"}
{"text":"Good was very good. This is a small unique place with good food. We had a large party and reservations are definitely needed for parties more than 6 due to limited dining space. I had the lobster and shrimp risotto which was very good. Large chunks of lobster and shrimp were very nice. Brought our own wine and the corking fee was only $6 per bottle. Being new comers the waitress was very helpful with suggestions for appetizers and recommended a couple of larger salads for the table to split as everything is ala carte. We also brought out own cupcakes for a birthday and they brought us forks and plates which was very nice. For all this I would give 4 stars. 

here are the negatives for larger parties. They added 20 percent gratuity to the bill. I usually tip 20 percent regardless if I get good service but I thought this was tacky as the custom for large parties is to add 18 to percent gratuity. Secondly, we were asked to move downstairs to a waiting area to finish our wine after we paid the check so they could clear space for other customers. I can understand their need to make room given the very small dining space but thought this was very rude given the amount of money we spent in dinner for a group of 9 (over $300). Particularly since it was only about 10 minutes since we finished dinner and paid the bill. Not sure I would go there again after that."}
{"text":"Very, very nice. Atmosphere was A+. BYOB. Food was delectable.  I had the Spaghetti Aglio which was perfectly spiced and quite flavorful. It had walnuts, shrimp, and dandelion--so good!  Hubby had Porcini Ravioli and permitted me a small bite. He adored thus fish and commented that the sauce was \"amazing\"!  We finished with the Rhubarb Crostata which was perfection. We ordered one of heir famous Beignets to take to a friends, it delivered happy results!  The service was friendly and most efficient!  Thus, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We showed up at 1 (1 hour before they close) for the Sunday brunch and they would not seat us. They said there was already multiple people in front of us, yet every name on the list was crossed off. Very disappointed in their customer service. They were simply being lazy and that is not how a top restaurant should behave."}
{"text":"Their butternut squash and kale salad is to die for.  I love that they serve their other stuff on beds of lettuce, as we all need more greens in our diet.  The only real drawback is the long lines."}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant. It had the best of the Italian food and also had some vegetarian options as well. I love their mini donuts. Overall a very good brunch."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place but was unfortunately disappointed. One good thing- the customer service! There was an hour wait but at around 50 minutes the ladies taking names got us seated outside instead of making us wait longer for an inside table. Our server was also very friendly.

The problem is the food- for that wait, it just wasn't that good. The beignets were uncooked in the middle and the oil they were fried in tasted old, our eggs weren't cooked properly, and everything was bland. I ordered what should have been a very tasty menu item, the Patatas Bravas, but they were unseasoned and even the chorizo tasted like a whole lot of nothing. I did like the plain zeppolli with pepper and parmesan, but my boyfriend wasn't impressed and thought they tasted like generic pizza shop breadsticks.

I wouldn't recommend, which bums me out because I usually like places like this. Oh well."}
{"text":"A group of us came here for brunch. it took a while so we waited down stairs in what looked to be a bar?? when it was time to eat we were starving so....we ordered a lot. I give it 3 because 4/8 items ordered were ok. nothing great or memorable. the beignet were the biggest let down, these are suppose to be their \"thing\"."}
{"text":"Really loved it!  I've been three weekends in a row because its hard to find a brunch place that holds up to girlfriends standards.  Finally it is here.  Great area to be on the weekend, healthy options, and being from new orleans the beignets are a nice touch.  Excellent prices for the quality that you get.  I'll be back on several occasions.  Unlike David T I welcome the people from Shadyside to try it out!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stood out in the rain for ~30 minutes a few Saturdays ago so that we could get a good spot in line for 6 PM dinner and see what the hype was about that could drum up such a large line.

After the doors opened and we were seated, we started with prosciutto wrapped mozzarella which was absolutely delicious, as well as some bread.  For our entrees, I got linguine with shrimp and clams and my girlfriend got the penne pepato.  Both dishes were excellent and well prepared.  Even though we were both stuffed at this point, we couldn't resist ordering beignets after noticing them on the dessert menu since I've never seen them offered at a restaurant outside of New Orleans before.  Needless to say, I burnt my mouth on them because I couldn't stop myself from scarfing down delicious freshly fried dough.

Service was great and the interior of the restaurant is comfortably cozy.  The tables are a bit close together for my liking because you definitely overhear the conversations of everyone around you but it is what it is.

Get there early, because you won't get a table if you're not close to the front of the line that forms."}
{"text":"E2 is one of my favorite places to eat, in Pittsburgh. I come here often with my family, which includes some vegetarians, and everyone is always super happy with their meals. The staff is very polite, and patient. Keep in mind, when dining here for brunch or dinner, that you might have to wait for a table-BUT IT IS WORTH IT(especially if they have chocolate espresso donuts on their brunch menu)!!"}
{"text":"Ate brunch here on a Saturday, early afternoon. Great space, definitely has potential as a warm, cozy place for the winter. Unfortunately the food didn't fully meet our expectations, but maybe it was just a one-off less-than-great day.

Coffee was good, though. As were the beignets.

Service, well, it was a bit hit and miss. The waitresses were pleasant enough but slow (maybe not their fault; the place was really packed).

I'll definitely return and try dinner."}
{"text":"Do NOT schedule an event here!

E2 cancelled my brother's rehearsal dinner at the last minute.  We were out of options at that point, and had to settle for place we could not afford.  The owner decided to give the space to his friend on that date, so they booted us out.  Very unprofessional. 

They were not apologetic, either.  It took a scathing email (which I never write) and a few phone calls to have them respond.  And we have yet to receive our security deposit.  

Please do not make the same mistake my family did.  Look somewhere else for anything more than a small dinner reservation."}
{"text":"GREAT HOMESTYLE ITALIAN BRUNCH!!

Went with hubby and baby for Sunday Brunch. Humble little place but cute - ate on patio. Menu reminded me of happy comfortable Italian HOMESTYLE cooking. Not over the top but still unique.

We tried bag of donuts- fried doughnut holes with ginger and sugar. Fried dough is always wonderful (rule of nature) but I wanted a more obvious punch of ginger flavor -was too subtle.

Tried Zeppolis - Savory pepper and parmesan coated fried dough with AND without anchovy. Great flavor combo - would be better with a little less parmesan - on the verge of too salty with anchovy. Would be great with side of homemade red sauce HINT HINT!

Little B had fancy kids grilled cheese - ate every bite

Hubs had Carbonara - great flavors, just right portion size. Ate it all!

Momma had frittata- AMAZING! Topped with delicious homemade sauce and served with grilled bread and small salad - perfect portion, tasty! Really simple yet savory red sauce - great to sop on the bread! This is just a lovely brunch plate with Italian twist!

This place also gets points for it's use of fresh, local, sustainable, organic produce! 

Really great little place investing in a up and coming location! Would love to go back and try other menu items!!!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the most pretentious place I've ever eaten.  Dishes like a lobster omelette do not impress.  Good food should be locally sourced and made well, extra fancy ingredients suggest an inability to really cook.  But the worst part was the donuts.  These are the specialty right?  I ordered two flavors, BOTH were undercooked.  They replaced them with more donuts that were undercooked.  If you can't even make your own specialty, well then, one star it is.

The servers were slow, unpleasant, and not very bright.  The atmosphere was cramped and extremely noisy.

Ignore the hype and find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped in to E2 this morning for breakfast on a whim after groggily browsing Yelp while Paige drove through the area, realizing we had some time to kill before being able to so some shopping we planned to do. I wasn't really at all familiar with the Highland Park at all, but must say I really love the small stretch of businesses along Bryant, and particularly loved trying E2. The atmosphere was very intimate, and alongside ourselves there were several other couples waiting outside for the doors to open at 9am. We were welcomed warmly, seated promptly, and given coffee and water quickly. Every item on the breakfast/brunch menu truly sounded unique and delicious. I personally had the a 'Patatas Bravas' dish which was a small, fresh salad with a nice zesty dressing alongside, beautiful peppers, onions, and potatoes mixed in with a locally sourced chorizo that truly had a beautiful kick! A top all aside from the salad was a great aioli sauce and a perfectly poached egg. 

This was a knockout brunch, and the service was great. I'd love to try dinner at e2 sometime."}
{"text":"[Otherwise known as E Squared]

I'm so incredibly glad that coffee is back on this side of campus! It's a perfect combination of location and offerings: great coffee and tea drinks, light/local cuisine.

Nice place, great service!"}
{"text":"My brunch club was super excited to try this place out and we all loved it!!  The upstairs was tiny and for a group of nine wasn't looking good but they were able to seat us in the downstairs section-much more room to spread out. I wish this place took reservations.  They are BYOB which is awesome. For brunch were we not drinking but they had a variety of teas.  We started with their well known homemade donuts. These were amazing. We tired the chocolate espresso (much more chocolate than coffee flavor which I liked), the salt/pepper for a nice savory treat (not my favorite) and the lavender lemon which was delicious!  I want to go back and try more. For my entrée I had the goat cheese omelet (without mushrooms and they happily did this for me) with a small salad and red potatoes. The service was great and there was 9 of us. The food is delicious and I can't wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot in a quaint, quiet neighborhood. Being from San Francisco, I'm used to waiting in line. And if you have to wait, you know it's good. E2 fit that mold. Waiting an hour for a table can be challenging, especially when you have a 1-year-old baby in the mix (not mine).

Thankfully, after all that waiting, our waitress comped our drinks. We weren't even complaining about the wait! I love the menu aesthetics. Simple and real. Its a hand-written list of dishes along with the prices. All the brunch choices are healthy and fresh.

I opted for poached eggs, accompanied by a salad and a side of bacon. Portion size was perfect, meaning I was able to finish my whole plate and not want an ounce of food more. Way to go E2, can't wait to come back and wait in line for as long as it takes.

P.S. If you can, try the mushroom risotto cakes or the blood orange goat cheese bread pudding. You're welcome."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of how I cook - I overload my food with spices in the hopes that it will make it so much more delicious, and instead I make it no longer palatable.  I'm not sure what kinds of spices they are using in their food, but it tends to destroy the natural goodness of a lot of the greens they serve.  Not to mention, you're usually shelling out upwards of six dollars for something that usually only holds you over for a few hours."}
{"text":"E2 was great until a few months ago when I noticed their lattes started tasting like there was no espresso in them.  I mentioned this 3 times and it never got fixed so I stopped going.  Stopped in recently to see if they'd fixed it and got a latte that was basically steamed milk and vanilla.  When I asked about it the girl drew me another \"double\" shot and it was about 2/3 the size of a single shot.  Looks like their machine is not calibrated to measure out shots correctly or (and I hope not) they are purposefully shafting customers on the amount of espresso they put in their drinks.  If I'm going to pay $5 for a latte, it needs to be made correctly!  Get on it guys!"}
{"text":"This morning I had the absolute best breakfast I ever ate. It was eggs and vegetable hash. I had dessert before breakfast and they were heavenly-berry doughnuts that were rolled in powdered sugar. The staff was attentive and the food delicious. Will be back again and again! What a great place!"}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful. Not your typical greasy spoon. Coffee was excellent. We got seated right away and service was quick and friendly. A little pricey for breakfast but well worth it for what you get."}
{"text":"Two years later and the attitude problem hasn't been resolved, which makes me think that management is supporting or even encouraging the hostility with which the hostess greets potential customers. 

When the hostess at brunch could even find a moment to speak to the line of people waiting for a table (she pushed by them several times, avoiding eye contact on her way up or down the stairs - apparently without the social skills to say \"sorry, but I'll be right back\" or something equally quick but welcoming), she was rude to each group, hostile in the way she flung \"45 minutes or more\" at each person (no other words crossed her lips in the 20 minutes we stood there), and actually grabbed away the clip board from somebody who had picked it up to check the wait!  After 20 minutes our appetite had been ruined and so we headed across the street for a lovely warm welcome from the hostess at Park Bruges."}
{"text":"Yuck. I went there twice. Nothing memorable was served, other than pasta from a box. I would not return."}
{"text":"Overpriced and mediocre. Paid over $7 for a tiny sandwich I could have made myself, it didn't even taste good. I really had high hopes for healthy options on campus but this fell flat."}
{"text":"Cozy brunch spot on Bryant Street in Highland Park. Very small restaurant with outdoor tables and shabby chic decor. Service is excellent. The food is good, but may vary significantly by dish. I would go here with family (it's kid-friendly), friends, or partner. BYOB. 

We stopped in on a Saturday morning, which was surprisingly uncrowded. The hostess was also our waitress, who did an excellent job fielding our questions and making good suggestions.  I would recommend the sandwich and bag of donuts. The former was some kind of amazing salami, egg, cheese, and arugula combo. The latter were small, cute, and dusted with some sugary cinnamon goodness. The mush and poached eggs were good, but not quite as excellent."}
{"text":"I decided to throw a little surprise birthday party at the Big Table for my sisters 34th birthday, the menu of course was prix fixe. Which is actually a weight off of my shoulders.  
Onward to dinner, the girl of the hour was surprised, we brought a ton of wine and booze to keep the party going and the liven up the evening. We started with meat, cheese, pickle, veggie platters they put out.  Everything was very good and I was definitely a fan.  They moved on to some appetizers: fried brussel sprouts, salad, and beans & greens. Delicious. I could have  eaten the entire platter of brussel sprouts. DIVINE. The beans & greens a bit of a miss for me, they were sort of bland and lacking that extra mmph. Dinner came it was rigatoni and sauce, meat balls, mushroom ravioli, and polenta. Everything was SO good. We were fighting over everything. The waitress brought us out extra ravioli's and meat balls (THANKS).  They provided the desert as well which was pound cake and a berry sauce. Quite amazing. I love to bake sweets but rarely eat them, but this NEEDED to be devoured.  
Out of the 14 of us, there wasn't any left overs or complaints.  We finished out bottles of wine and vodka and beer and headed off in the direction of another bar area.  

I would definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting to have a little celebration. The big table ROCKS!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try E2 for the longest time and I finally made it out for a friend's birthday, in which we reserved a \"big table.\" For $40 a person (and you must have a minimum of 12 people) you are served a prix fixe four course meal served family style, sampling a bit of everything on their menu. Btw, no corkage fee for the big table either. Sweet deal, right?

So my food experience, I had several dishes that were to die for, while also several disappointing dishes. My favorites that I couldn't get enough of: Ricotta Corn Fritters, Grilled Asparagus, Penne Papato, Campanelle Carbonara, and of course the Beignets. The okay, but I've had better: Meatballs. The disappointing: Local Greens, and Beans & Greens. I actually love greens but these dishes just didn't impress me. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience. The service was outstanding and the food seemed to keep coming out. I love that it's served family style and that you get to try several dishes during each course. I would be interested in returning to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"The man who cracked the door at 5:30 brightly said, \"Don't go far, we open at six.\" So my wife, whose birthday we intended to celebrate there, our two guests and I went to a warm spot nearby. When we returned right after six, the same man said it would be a two hour wait, as the place was fully seated.
So, I asked him what happened. He said a line formed after we left, and the placed filled by our return.
He said he was a manager and sarcastically said he could not evict people from a table to seat us. His poor communication cost us our anticipated evening. What he did not say at 5:30 was be first in line or stay to get in line, or you will lose your spot. What he did not do at 5:30 was offer to put us on the seating list. When confronted about it, he was unapologetic. The combination of his poor communication and subsequent indifferent attitude should give the owners reason to fix or replace him."}
{"text":"The brussel sprouts........amazing.  All food was great!!  I don't know why I'm just finding out about this little gem.  Oh, and BYOB.....duh."}
{"text":"So, our first time to E2, we were underwhelmed. We came for brunch, and while parts of the meal were pretty good, the overall experience wasn't good enough to get us to come back.

Some friends mentioned that E2 was doing dinners, and suggested that we give it another try. And, we are glad we did. They specialize in pastas, which is perfect for those of us who are vegetarian. The pastas are fresh and delicious. They are not meat heavy, so if you are looking for that, go across the street to Joseph Tambellini's. Otherwise, the food is good, the service is lovely, and the ambiance is cozy and nice. A very nice addition to the growing Highland Park restaurant landscape."}
{"text":"Finally made it here for the first time last night with friends. Such a cute little restaurant in Highland Park. We ordered the gorg mess for an appetizer and I ordered the Parmesan Polenta with Sausage as my entree. The appetizer was delicious. My polenta was also very good but if I were to get it again I would get it without the sausage. Unfortunately I found out this place is closing Saturday. Hopefully it opens in a new location so I can go back."}
{"text":"e2 has a great menu that is always changing with a focus on seasonal and local. The four times I've been I've always had great service with no attitude from anyone.

I love the food, everything's been delicious and I try to vary what I eat each time--pretty easy considering their ever changing menu. I especially love their desserts, which are handled with a kind of care I could only expect from the Enrico family.

I'll definitely continue to come back to e2, something about just makes me happy.

I wrote a longer review of e2, with plenty of delicious photos on my web site. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/09/culinary-merits-bryant-street/"}
{"text":"Not a single bad word to say. Came for brunch and was told there'd be a short wait - at which point we were given coffee and a tour of the downstairs/learned about the family-style dinners.

Brunch was OUTSTANDING. Seriously, it is not just your average \"egg and sweets\" type of menu. Each option was unique with flavors and locally sourced. And DOUGHNUT HOLES. An entire menu.

Totally worth the visit. A great neighborhood spot with great service."}
{"text":"Fabulous brunch. The pomegranate donuts were a wonderful start. Had the patatas bravas. Simply great."}
{"text":"I've only ever been for brunch, but it's great. Today I split two dishes with a friend. First the chorizo, egg, and potato dish was very nice - a little spice to the chorizo but not overwhelming,  and the aioli with it added a nice creamy flavor. We also split french toast with an apple compote - sweet but not too sweet and a perfect portion.

Service is good and food comes out fast. It's a small place so expect to wait around brunch time. There's a large room downstairs for waiting, though, which is great. You can have a seat and help yourself to some coffee while you wait for your table."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews of E2, I was excited to give brunch a try. I am generally very happy with restaurants receiving high ratings on Yelp but I had to be honest with myself and give this place 3/5. I went with three friends on a Sunday morning and the general agreement was that it was good, but maybe not worth a second time.
-The staff is very friendly, especially since they know you may have a 20-30 min wait. 
Although they offered us coffee immediately, we all thought it was complimentary until seeing the bill at the end of our meal ($2/coffee).
-I ordered the Mush, which is a beautiful assembly of polenta topped with sausage and toast. But it was swimming in a pool of maple syrup and pecans. Had they limited the sweetness of the dish by reducing the sugar, it would have been much more enjoyable, as I found myself wiping off every piece of polenta and sausage I cut along the rim of the plate before putting anything in my mouth. I was craving salt by the end of the meal. My friends had the omelette and frittata, which they enjoyed.
-I'm hoping we paid for the freshness of the ingredients (avg brunch dish is $11), which would make up for the actual taste.
-Beignets were great, but kind of heavy. Ginger Tony donuts were ok too, but to me, they were not stellar enough for 5 stars.

I admire the philosophy of the place, no less, and use of fresh ingredients (everyone raved about the freshness of the salad, omelette, etc) but the execution could be better to receive 5 stars."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Kind of hipster vibe. I've been here for brunch about 10 times.  My favorites are the sriracha donuts with bleu cheese dip and goat cheese omelette.  The staff is super friendly also and they give you free coffee if there is a long wait.  I always bring friends here and they really like it."}
{"text":"I have been here for dinner a few times and once for brunch.  I was not disappointed any of the times.  I love that it is byob.  I brought wine for dinner and vodka to mix with orange juice for brunch.  If you go for dinner, you must try some meat and cheeses.  They are fresh and delicious.  I was very pleased with the pasta dishes each time I had them.  Get here quick it gets packed.....close to 5 star."}
{"text":"The dining room is very small and it can get loud in there.

I got the porcini cappelletti and it was delicious! It wasn't really what I expected but the ingredients worked well together. Portion was large and worth the $18."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with 2 of my friends.  We went on a Sunday morning around 10 am and had about a 2 hour wait.  Fortunately we were prepared for the wait so it didn't bother us much.  They also give you free coffee while you're waiting, which helps a lot!!  The restaurant is very small and has a warm atmosphere about it.  The hostess and our eventual waiter were very friendly and attentive.   

The menu was a chalkboard menu, which I love, because you know it's always changing and made with fresh ingredients. All 3 of us enjoyed our meals, and, since I sampled my friends, I can concur that they were all equally delicious!  We had read good reviews about the beignets before hand and I have to reiterate those reviews - these are a must order item!  You will not be dissappointed.  

All in all, E2 is a cozy setting with a mouth-watering menu - the only downside being the long wait - but that won't deter me from going back for brunch and hopefully (soon) visitng for dinner."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise and a unique experience.

On a whim when looking for a Saturday morning brunch, Barry R and our wives settled on checking out E2's morning digs given its praise.

Heading there, I'll admit I was concerned we would even get in.  I had heard E2 was a small place, and given the fact that we've become \"Brunchburgh\", I thought for sure we'd have an hour-plus wait.

When we arrived, I was thrilled to hear we would only have a 30 minute wait.  Even better, E2 welcomes those on the list to grab a coffee in their basement group space while waiting.  Surprisingly, this may be the first wait I've ever ENJOYED!  The blend of good company, a unique space, decent coffee and no rush was a welcome endeavor even though I was curing a bit of the effects from a long prior night out.

When we got called to our table, we settled quickly on ordering some tasty variations of fried dough...  White Berry (powder sugar covered donuts with berry jam) and Maple Bacon (larger beignets doused in maple and covered with bacon...  the name says it all).  Both varieties were knock out and it took serious restrain to not order the other 7+ varieties available.

Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals (hash, papas, polenta w/ red sauce and mush).  My mush, a polenta cake topped with sausage, bacon, pecans, maple syrup and toast was rockin'.  The only drawback to the meal was the toast, which for some reason, I just didn't dig.

Overall, I'll definitely go back.  The only thing I think they could change is to add a second door at the entry (the breeze gets pretty cold when people walk in!)."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my sister-in-law's birthday. I was on Whole30 so my options were limited, but I did have options! So my personal experience is limited to fried eggs, potatoes, and bacon. Boy, it was the best fried eggs, potatoes (rosemary) and bacon. I asked them to cook my food in olive oil instead of butter and they were happy to accommodate my request. Others got the Charizo and biscuit, the omelette, a croissant sandwich, and some sort of soup/chili looking dish. Sorry, I didn't pay attention to all the official names since I just had eggs, potatoes and bacon (farmer's breakfast), but they all looked (and according to them), very delicious!

Others had the donuts (lemon rosemary, Nutella and whipped cream, and powered benguets) and they were gone within seconds. I did drink their coffee black, so that says a *lot* for me (I can only drink coffee that I really like without unsweetened coconut milk, which I didn't have with me).

We went for Brunch, so it was cash only! Not sure if this is the case with all of their meals, but that is a bit of a bummer.

The staff was so  nice and helpful. Am looking forward to returning here when I am off Whole30 :)."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and had heard the wait can be long. We called from the car asking if they could put in our name, but were kind of rudely told that was out of the question. They do not use apps like NoWait either, so in the end we had to wait a little less than an hour from when we got there. They have coffee downstairs while you wait, but it is not nearly as good as what you'd expect from a place that has nice brunch, so we went around the corner to Tazza D'Oro and got some really good coffee while we waited. While the Coffee at E2 is not terrible, I would say coffee is an important part of a good brunch, and I expect a place like this to take it a little more seriously. We tried the coffee they serve at the tables too, and it does have notes of sawdust and old dryness that are often found in lower-quality coffees, primarily as a result of improper storage and the beans being months off roast. We ordered the scramble and the frittata and both were good, but not to the extent we'll want to come back. We wanted a minute to decide on donuts, and when the waitress came back it was apparently too late as they had turned off the fryer for the day. It would have been nice if we were told we had to hurry, as some of the donuts looked very tempting (raspberry rhubarb, for instance). You can pay with cards here for dinner, but brunch is cash-only for some reason. Why?!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for dinner and was blowing away!
They host a great brunch but save your moola and make reservations for an unforgettable dinner (only accepts reservations for 6+ people).
 
Vegetarian perspective- lots of great options here but very pasta heavy entrees :
Tonight we took full advantage of BYOB (6$ corkage fee) and brought some high end beers. We enjoyed the roasted vegetable gratin (salty in the best way possible, veggie heaven) and the citrus salad (fresh but found the combo with radicchio too sour) as starters. The bread was stellar and I liked the funky Gorgonzola spread (polarizing for other members of the dining party).
For mains- the wild mushroom ravioli was super flavorful and with a lush thick mushroom sauce. Excellent. We enjoyed the tortellini en brodo which came in a nice rich sauce (meat broth, ordered by my husband). We aren't the biggest pasta people but E2 finds a way to make them decadent and somewhat worth the price ($18+).
Dessert of chocolate meringue pie and pecan pie did not blow us away. Save your dollars there.
Service and pace were noteworthy. Excellent dining experience in intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food awesome. Terrific flavors. It is very loud though. Hard to hear at our table."}
{"text":"How did I live so long in a world without a DONUT MENU?  I just don't know.  My group of nine dined on three varieties of donuts including Lemon Lavender, Chocolate Espresso and Zeppolli - the most amazing peppered donut concoction ever made.  Each donut order comes with five donut \"holes,\" but they're big holes, so one or two is enough.  I can't believe I just said that.  That's not even a little true. You'll want an entire order to yourself, but save room, because the best is yet to come.  

I chose the omelette of the day as my entrée.  Couldn't tell you what all was in it, but the goat cheese was as creamy as a goat's...cheese.  The salad was a nice addition and the potatoes were delightful if just a touch underdone.  We were seated downstairs which was pretty frigid, but an awesome space nonetheless.  Warm up the joint a bit and it's five stars all the way.  

I can't wait to visit E2 again for dinner - they serve donuts, right?"}
{"text":"This place is literally a hidden jewelry! It is a cozy restaurant with lots of character.  The space is not that big but it definitely gives you a nice, warm feel! The food is delicious and freshly made (at least my dish - the ravioli - was great and fresh).  The service is prompt and very professional.  There are not much things to say about the place because it is one of these places that you will definitely go back because your experience was nice.

Also keep in mind that the classification on Yelp might be a bit misleading; the place is an Italian restaurant rather than a (general) Mediterranean restaurant (but this is fine).

Only one down side for the place that the cork fee (because it is a BYOB) is 6$ (I find this rather unrealistic when a bottle of wine is $10-$12 :) )"}
{"text":"Finally went here for brunch today after having it on the to do list for over a year. On a Saturday morning, they were able to seat us immediately without a wait which was unexpected but pleasant. The interior is small and cozy, and the waitstaff were friendly.

As appetizers, they have a variety of interesting donut flavors available. We tried the caramel ones which were among the best donuts I've ever had. Amazing. These aren't your standard donuts - they are little balls of deliciousness and come five to an order covered with toppings.

Neither of us was as impressed with the actual brunch food. It was good, but on the heavy side and not overly remarkable. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to have brunch here again, but I would definitely go back for the donuts."}
{"text":"This place is extremely overpriced for what you get. I was really excited when it first opened, but after eating there two or three times, it's lost its novelty, and I see it for what it really is: overpriced and boring. The vegetarian sandwich is nothing that you can't get at the convenience stores inside the Memorial Union for a bit less."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious. Service is awful and they are not students on campus. Every time I go I swear they are slower and slower especially when it is crowded in there in between class times. Step it up please."}
{"text":"I am so glad that this place is literally right outside my office.  They offer a great selection of teas and coffee drinks. Their menu is not extensive, but they do offer some tasty and healthy options for salads and sandwiches. Their cranberry apple chicken salad is SO good. Everyone in my office is addicted and we all get it at least once a week. I like that you have the option to eat it with bread or over fresh greens. Go early because it gets quite packed for lunch and they begin to sell out of items. They also serve cookies, brownies, and muffins, which I have not had, but I heard they were also delish. This place is not super cheap, but it's worth it to me to have healthier lunch options and to not have to leave campus for lunch or a coffee run."}
{"text":"more like 2.5 stars

I'd been looking forward to visiting E2, since I love the woodfired pizza and breezy continental vibe at Enrico's cafe in the Strip.

They're working the same vibe at E2, with water served in repurposed wine bottles, wildflowers on the table, and menu chalked on the wall. All very cute and comfortable.

Unfortunately, the food was very disappointing. We went for brunch service. I ordered the \"frisee, bacon & egg\" salad, hoping it'd be something like that old favorite, lardon & frisee salad. The bacon and egg were just fine, but instead a heap of frisee, I got a wan pile of undressed generic Restaurant Depot spring mix. 

Sure there was some frisee tossed in there, but this was just sad. I am so sick and tired of spring mix. That's why I jumped at the frisee! What's worse than undistinguished baby salad greens? Undressed baby salad greens. At $11 I was hoping for something a little bit better thought-out.

My dining companion had the italian hoagie with fried egg, and it was just that. A competent italian hoagie, not much different than what you'd find at your corner hoagie joint, other than the price. woo-freaking-hoo. 

Enrico people: if you're reading this, know that I love you, but that I expect more from you."}
{"text":"I went to E2 again last night and had the best service and amazing food.  Kate Romane is one of the most talented, creative and hardworking chefs in Pittsburgh, and her food is always thoughtfully prepared, locally sourced, and delicious.

I participated in the Kickstarter for the room downstairs, and I have been there many times for their private events.  Simply top notch!

What I love about this place is that the appetizer menu is designed for sharing.  You buy plates for the table, and you end up with a lot of variety.  It's a fun factor that is hard to describe, suffice to say it's relaxed, exciting, and very satisfying.

The entrees explore a wide range of gourmet taste sensations, but at an affordable price.  Delicious food that will not bust your budget.  

The desserts are amazing.  I had a strawberry rhubarb dish with currants that was amazing.

The last thing I want to emphasize is that E2 is vegetarian friendly.  You don't have to worry that your vegetarian friends will have limited choices, they have so much to choose from, more than almost any other restaurant in Pittsburgh.

One small issue with E2 is that the room is rather loud.  It's an issue with the acoustics.  You can have a nice conversation here, it's just a little noisy and not ideal for quiet conversation.  That's why I recommend sitting outside, which is probably the best way to experience this amazing restaurant in Highland Park.

In summary, highly recommended, lots of fun, and great food."}
{"text":"E-squared had a big build-up from my hosts, and it did not live up to the hype.  

There were good things:  The dish I ordered for was very tasty, the ingredients were high quality and the chef really knows their stuff.  

Then some not-so-good things:  Rude service (much contrary to what I've read in other reviews here), not many \"greens\" in the \"beans and greens,\" don't take credit cards for brunch (what century is this?), and the worst tea selection I've seen in recent memory.  On the latter point, they are across the street from a family-owned natural grocer that sells teas.  I'm just sayin.

Underlying it all is a bit of an attitude issue that wouldn't fly on the west coast.  And the food would not be that distinctive at home - good, but not justifying the attitude.  

Good meal, but a little deflating."}
{"text":"We brunched here today and were delighted to snag a table outside.  We arrived at about 10:30 am and waited about 15 minutes for our table, enjoying a cup of coffee while we waited.   The host was very friendly and we enjoyed conversing with him.  We ordered beignets  and they arrived after about 15 minutes.  We were disappointed as we tasted them- we felt they were not fried enough as the center was colder, wet, and doughy.  We sent them back and asked for another order of them ( something that we don't typically do) and asked for them to be fried just a little longer.  Our meals came out next.  My husband had the polenta and it was very good.  I had the special quiche of the day.  It was brought to the table almost cold, but I didn't want to send the quiche back for reheating because we had already sent the beignets back, so I ate it even though it was cold.  The beignets came out for the second time and they were still under fried.  We dipped them in powder sugar and ate them anyway!  Without our asking, the waitress did not charge us for the beignets since we weren't totally satisfied - which was very kind of her to do so considering that we ate them.  Sometimes you go to a place and it's just a bad day, maybe that's what happened today.  I doubt if we'll go back, though, because there's too many other places to try."}
{"text":"Everything about our brunch was top notch -- we were seated immediately; the server visited shortly thereafter and returned promptly to take our order; he was attentive, helpful, and friendly; and most importantly, the food was scrumptious. I had the chorizo & chicpea gravy over a house made biscuit & an over hard egg. It was a healthy serving. The buttermilk biscuit was soft, fluffy, and buttery, like a tasty pillow of delicious. The chorizo & gravy were the perfect complement. I also had a glass of their fresh squeezed OJ which hit the spot. My friend had the beans & greens with a side salad. She said it was so good that it completely reversed her opinion of the restaurant (she wasn't thrilled with how salty her dinner was the last time we went). We both enjoyed the decadent chocolate and vanilla glazed donuts as a breakfast dessert. Highly recommend their Saturday brunch."}
{"text":"Our first time at E2. Had a bit of a wait,but it was worth every moment. The special was a carrot, sweet potato bisque. It had incredible depth of flavor. I would go back just for it. For our main course, I had wild mushroom ravioli and Anth had gnocchi in a pink sauce. Both were fantastic. Adam was our server and had great knowledge about each dish as well as being pleasant. It was a terrific dinner."}
{"text":"(This review is for Sunday Sauce.)

A group of my friends and I went to Sunday Sauce, which is an event E2 does that you have to pre-buy tickets to ($40/person). Basically it's located in the lower level and they set up this long table. There were probably 30 some people there all at the same long table. It's BYOB and even though I didn't bring anything, the people sitting next to me were so kind they offered me some of their wine. 

When we sat down (they label the seats so if you're going in a group and want to sit together, you might want to buy tickets at the same time), they had focaccia bread and some antipasto dishes on the table already. Then, they promptly brought out a snap pea salad with fresh mint and goat cheese, a salad with mozzarella chunks, charred broccolini and sausage, and a roasted carrot and radicchio gratin (which was so good). I really liked how they made vegetables the center of attention. Even my friend who doesn't normally like veggies was a huge fan of everything they served. It all tasted very fresh, too. They then followed that by serving a lamb bolognese with gnocchi (the gnocchi could've been fluffier), grilled asparagus with egg and blue cheese dressing (odd but delicious combo), a kale caesar salad, and a risotto with mushrooms (yum). Everything was family style (which I love) and you just take as much as you want and then pass it on. At the end of the meal, they had coffee available to go with the Pittsburgh creme pie slice that everyone got. It was scrumptious. Seriously, it's been two days and I'm still raving about how great and how delicious the Sunday Sauce experience was. Oh, also they pack up leftovers and leave it on a counter for people to choose what they want to take home when they leave (tip: get there fast or there won't be anything left). I know the menu won't be the same next time, but I'm positive it'll still be an amazing experience, so I'm eager to go back!

Overall, awesome food, good company (the kind who offer to share their wine), and nice service/ambiance!"}
{"text":"The wait for this place can be long because it's so tiny, but they have an area downstairs where you can have a cup of coffee and wait. Luckily for us (group of 5), it was a bit cold outside so they hadn't opened up the outside seating yet. We were fine with keeping our jackets on and asked if we could just sit outside so we were seated immediately. 

Our food was so good, everyone loved everything. I had the chorizo dish, a friend had the goat cheese omelette, another had the bagel and lox plate. Hot, tasty, and well worth the money. The waitress was really friendly.

Have tried to go back a couple of times but the wait was just too long for our starving and likely a bit hungover group.

Cash only"}
{"text":"When I saw that ASU had decided to put in a hotdog stand within sight of my office window, I became concerned for my arteries.  Luckily, however, they also put in E2.  E2, I believe, means the second incarnation of the Engrained restaurant in ASU's MU building, which focuses on local and organic healthy foods.  E2 takes up the same mantra, but offers less (due to its size and focus on speed).

In the what has become my crisis of conscience corner, I have reluctantly chosen E2 over the hotdog place every time.  Devil be damned.

I'm afraid that the food at E2 isn't all that stellar however.  I have enjoyed the morning yogurt, but they do over sweeten it a bit.  That's not to my taste, but they will probably sell a ton of it to frappachino types.  The sandwiches I've had have been premade, making the bread a bad texture from refrigeration and the bottom layer always soggy from the dressing they use.  The drinks here are great, as are the pastries.  The green tea is delicious and keeps me going for hours.  

4 stars because I applaud the attempt to make campus healthier, but not 5 because I feel like the menu design is all talk and not actually tested on a daily basis."}
{"text":"What a gem!  Thanks god this place is going to start serving dinners too!   Very cute decor, quaint countryside cafe vibe, small outdoor seating area, friendly staff, chalkboard menu, fresh, local/organic ingredients.  Had brunch here the other day. Loved it!  

1) get the beignets!  $5 delightful explosions of fried deliciousness 
2) BYOB - bring booze for mimosas or bloody mary's 
3) ginger donuts are very fun 
4)  polenta with a red pepper cream sauce and fried egg with runny yolk - very nice. $14
5) good coffee
6) practically drooled on my neighbor's breadpudding with goat cheese - next time i'm getting that"}
{"text":"E2 is excellent.  It is by far my favorite place on Bryant street.

I always end up getting the risotto of the day. I have yet to be disappointed. It is always tasty and perfectly prepared. The portion is also perfect. If I'm super hungry, I make sure to get a salad. 

As a warning, The place is very small and cramped. I don't mind, but some guests with me have had issues with the lack of space."}
{"text":"The meal of all meals. E2 was the best meal I've had in pittsburgh, hands down! I got a creamy pasta dish and added chicken. It was on point. An adequate portion size packed with flavor. My husband got the special of the night, a ravioli of some kind. While we both thought it was delicious, we wish there were a few more raviolis in the dish. We shared fried green tomatoes and a bowl of pumpkin soup and both were more than satisfying. We closed the night with dessert and ordered the beignets. Fluffy dough balls coated in sugar! They tasted a lot like a funnel cake."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. They have very unique tastes and dishes. The wait staff is also very friendly. Their beignets are not my favorite though. However, I highly suggest trying their specials as well as their zeppollis. You have to get there really early or after the brunch rush though because there's usually a decent wait."}
{"text":"I am usually a bit picky, but the Saturday evening dinner experience for our table of 6 was top notch all around.

Everyone at our table loved their orders.  My snapper, chorizo and butternut squash purée special sounded like an odd combo, but the combination of sweet and salty was phenomenal.

E2s menu is seasonal.  Right now, their winter menu is a winner.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The girls and I decided to head to E2 for brunch on a Saturday morning. Because it was a beautiful summer day, we had no difficulty getting an inside table as most people were waiting to be seated outside. We decided to start off right with an order of the homemade donuts to share. We chose the orange glazed donuts with almonds. I would describe the donuts as average. here was a hint of oange flavor but nothing note worthy. The chopped almonds did not stick to the donuts and ended up at the bottom of the dish. Being a fan of a sweet and carb heavy breakfast, I chose the strawberry french toast from the chaulk board menu which was heavy on egg dishes. After finishing the donuts, I eagerly awaited my french toast. Strawberries, chocolate and bread. How could you go wrong? E2 found a way. I was a ittle disappointed to see that the strawberries were not actually chocolate covered but werenormal strawberries with chocolate sauce drizzled over the french toast. A little bit of false advertising if you as me but I was still excited to take my first bite. My excitement soon diminished. The french toast was hard. I'm not talking been left on the griddle too long hard. I'm talking stale bread that has been left out for a couple days hard. It was so hard, I had difficulty cutting into it with my knife. Despite my love of carbs, I left an entire piece of french toast on the plate. In conclusion, I seriously doubt that I will return to E2 for brunch. The poor execution has left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Brunch at E2 is definitely a 5 star experience, however I was disappointed when I went there for dinner once. The decor, service, and menu are all lovely for both brunch and dinner. The brunch food is exceptional. I am vegetarian, and they have several vegetarian options. Today I had the croissant french toast, which was amazing. They also have really good coffee that is not too weak. My husband is a huge coffee snob, and he said their coffee was the best part of brunch. I also love all the little donuts that they do.

I had dinner here once several months ago, and all of the food was way over salted. It was very disappointing because all of the dishes sounded so good, and looked beautiful when they were brought to the table, but when we tried them, it was as though brine had been poured over everything. If they would just hold the salt, I'd give them 5 stars for dinner too."}
{"text":"We came to E2 for brunch at around 9:30 and we had to wait for about an hour. Although the wait was long, there were seats in the basement space, which was quite cozy and a good place to relax while waiting for a spot.
We were seated after an hour wait. We shared the chocolate pistachio donuts and I got the fried risotto. The donuts were delicious. It was fluffy and the chocolate sauce wasn't overly sweet. However, it is very hot. The fried risotto was also wonderful. It was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The tomato sauce wasn't overpowering and had a wonderful aroma.
Despite the long brunch line, I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"YUM. Chef Kate Romane is a genius. Pittsburgh is very lucky to have her. Doing Italian food is relatively easy, but she does it extraordinarily well.

The special of the evening was corn fritters. They were absolutely delicious. They were also super filling so I was very glad we decided to share.

I had the wild mushroom ravioli. It was very good. Definitely had an earthy flavor to it, which our waitress described perfectly. My guest had the ricotta ravioli, which was much sweeter (too sweet for me), but it was excellent as well.

The servings are very generous and it was a struggle to stay for dessert, but we did it for the beignets. There are five in a serving, so good for sharing. They are perfectly done and topped with lots and lots of powdered sugar.

It is pretty hard to get in here, but if you go right as they open on a week night there shouldn't be an issue. If you're a fan of Italian or just good food in general, I highly recommend E2."}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was poor. We were sitting out in the blazing sun without an umbrella or water for a good 5-10 minutes. When it got to us it was lukewarm. The food tasted worse after being uncomfortable in the sun for so long, I just wanted to get out of there. Doesn't seem like they have any air conditioning inside either."}
{"text":"My husband and I had just finished the Pittsburgh great race, and were in search of a delicious brunch joint. We had heard good things about e2, and wanted to come check it out. I was heartened that we did not have any wait at all on a Sunday, and our waiter got us started with coffees and water right away. He emphasized that if we wanted any substitutions on the menu, it was no problem. Normally, I would hesitate to order anything altered, but he made a big deal that this was really something they were completely used to, not a big deal. My husband ordered a frittata, and I ordered the white bean, rapini and sausage hash, without the sausage (I'm a vegetarian), eggs over easy. The orders came quickly, great! 

However, I had to send mine back as the eggs were completely well done, yolks completely solid. Not a big deal, and my eggs were redone very quickly. My husband's meal was very tasty - I had a bit of his while waiting. When my order came back the eggs were perfect! I dug right in. Only to find a huge piece of sausage in my hash! 

Here's the thing...I would NEVER have ordered the hash that normally comes with sausage, sans sausage, if the server hadn't outright encouraged me to make substitutions. I'm not usually a difficult diner. If I have to send something back (which rarely happens), I understand kitchens are busy, mistakes happen. However, having to send something back twice? Not okay. Then, we were charged for both meals! Yikes! They apologized in a hurried manner (the place was not that busy, if it was a mad house I would have understood this kind of behavior, but it was NOT).

Also...if the hash had been AMAZING and WONDERFUL I would have probably also given more stars. I think if they'd done everything perfectly - e.g. the eggs were truly over easy, there was no sausage...I would have given them a 3/5 stars. The food was pretty bland, almost unsalted, and had little spicing of any kind. My hash was 80% bland fried potato chunks, 20% egg/rapini/bean. Not optimal for an 11$ brunch. However, given the awful service and poor recovery, I will never return."}
{"text":"I came to this little hole in the wall looking place for brunch with some friends while in Pittsburgh. In true Pittsburgh style it was cool, interesting, unique and delicious. I had a breakfast 'hash' which was basically chopped up potatoes, lots of veggies, eggs, and chorizo. It was SO good! And I didn't feel leaving too full or gross or like I had just eaten something totally unhealthy, which can often happen with brunch. Cool atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"Initial thoughts: I came here for brunch after hearing a lot of good things about their brunch menu. I love beignets and donuts, so i was excited. 

Wait time: We had to wait about a 1 hour - 1.5 hours for a table, but really I don't think it was worth it. The waiting room in the basement is rustic with long wooden tables. There is all you can drink coffee for $1. The coffee was just coffee.

Appetizers/Small dishes: We got 2 kinds of zeppolis. One was savory - with black pepper and parm + pepperonata sauce; the other was blood orange beignets (special of that day). Both were good but they should have made them crispier. They were pretty soggy and had no texture.

Main dish: I got a pasta entree and it was pretty generic. It was pasta with pepperonata sauce, two fried eggs, and a huge piece of toast. The pasta was clearly store-bought, and the sauce was nothing special...felt like I could make it at home. 

Cost: Cost was decent, but re

Ambience: Classic brunch atmosphere - lots of people talking chatting and enjoying a nice Saturday morning-afternoon. There are a lot of random photos everywhere, which give it a rustic, almost-hipster charm. 

Overall: Nothing special, and slightly disappointed by soggy \"fried\" dough. If their menu changes and I hear their zeppolis/beignets are crispy, I would go back."}
{"text":"Excellent establishment! Their greens and beans with sausage were great; greens still had a bit of a crunch to them. It's a byob and the atmosphere lends itself to an at home feeling of comfort. It's great for a big group or just a few."}
{"text":"I usually love this place. But they did a really uncool thing that made me pretty mad. They turned us away from brunch even though there were open tables and an hour and a half before closing. Then the went ahead and seated a couple they were obviously friends with who got in right after us. Amazingly irritating. May be a long time until I return."}
{"text":"A Highland Park satellite of the fabulous Enrico's Biscotti mothership in the Strip District.  I had the impression they were open only for weekend brunch, hopefully that will change as the operation picks up steam.  They have a lovely dining room that opens to a big outdoor terrace, comfortable blackboard-painted tables, fresh flowers, white walls, wooden floors, menu written on a big chalkboard up front.  The food is fresh, seasonal, local, with a focus on Mediterranean cuisine, beautifully presented.  I had an asparagus and goat-cheese omelette with carmelized onions, roasted red potatoes and a frise salad with walnuts, goat cheese, cranberries and balsamic viniagrette -- basic and yummy.  My friend had baked polenta swimming in fresh bright marinara.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table -- we hung out in a downstairs bar area where you can nosh on coffee, tea and biscotti while you wait.   E2 is a great, very welcoming new option for brunch in the burgh -- go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I LOVE this place! 

A friend invited me out to brunch here and I totally fell in love. And proceeded to eat EVERYTHING. everything.

I know, I know, it's tiny and crowded and whatever, but for some reason, it just made me feel super cozy and reminded me of some of my favorite brunch spots on the west coast. There was something about the menu, the food, the service, the lovely fall day - everything just came together and it made our experience a blast. Naturally, we started out sharing the tony bag of d's (a delicious concoction of fried dough and ginger sugar) and the brown sugar zeppolis (also quite tasty). The tony bag of d's had a great kick of ginger spice - none of that weak artificial stuff! My only wish was that the sugar stuck better to the dough (don't worry, I licked that plate clean). 

I ordered the polenta with red sauce and dippy eggs - totally delish! The dippy eggs gave the polenta a rich creaminess that cornmeal could simply never achieve on its own. I also had the opportunity to try the risotto cakes and the frittata with leeks, both of which were great. While everything was super tasty, the risotto cakes definitely stole the show. Like the perfect cookie, the risotto cakes were crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. What made them REALLY outstanding was the strong nutty undertones. I'm not sure if they were cooked in walnut oil, but whatever it was, it was amazing!

Definitely worth the trip, especially considering everything split between us was about $15-20/person (including tax/tip). I think this might be a new regular in my weekly brunch rotation!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and had a great time! It's a small dining area so we had to wait about 25 minutes but they were more than willing to take a phone number and let us wander until they were ready. 

The food is really good- I recommend the hash. It is also BYOB and cash only so keep that in mind! Corkage fee was only $6 

Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a good brunch in Pittsburgh :)"}
{"text":"E2 and Dish (in the Southside) are by far my favorite Italian spots in the city. Never a bad dinner here. The ambiance is great and they always quickly greet you.

It's BYOB ($6/bottle corkage fee). I usually start with a meat and cheese plate or the grilled prosciutto as an appetizer.

For dinner, my absolute favorite entree is the Carbonara. It's the BEST carbonara I've ever had. 

If you have room for dessert, the beignets are the way to go!"}
{"text":"Coming here for brunch was probably one of the best ideas I've ever had. Had always heard about E2 but never really had a real chance to come eat. Brought my mom here for brunch a few weeks ago, when you first walk up to the entrance you think \"wow what an awesome idea\", at least that's what I thought, the front of the restaurant looks like it used to be somebodies house, then when you walk in you almost feel like maybe you should change your mind, but then you get seated, you see how the menu is on a chalkboard and you see how everything you're sitting at is so unique. Although it's small, it's worth feeling cramped. The food is out of this world and you can tell they use fresh local food with good ingredients. E2 is also BYOB so if you want a mimosa with your brunch you bring your favorite champagne and they provide the OJ.
When my mom and I were there there was a bit of a wait, the waitress offered us to wait downstairs and gave us some coffee while we were waiting for a table, downstairs is this beautifully renovated room with mason jars hung up at lights and the beautifully crafted brand new bar and furnished tables. Which we later found out was a new party room donated to them.
E2 is a wonderful experience all around, food and service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in Bryant Street, this brunch spot is a must-attend location in Pittsburgh. 

After wanting to try it for weeks, I finally went and could not have been happier. The workers were extremely friendly. The atmosphere was peaceful. And the food was delicious, filling and came out quickly.

I got the chick-peas chorizo with red sauce served with a biscuit and egg. It was delicious! This restaurant really puts a spin on items you would never consider serving together.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"to Jonathan.. the Pita is back and even better, It is now grilled!!!!

As for there drinks, check out the sangria iced tea... i'm seriously addicted to it!

For the food, there food has greatly increased, and yes they do have to make there sandwiches a head of time but with the space and amount of customers that filter in and out of the store, they would be crazy to try to to make them in the store."}
{"text":"My favorite part: BYOB!
My least favorite part: they don't take reservations
I have been a few times and either have to get there right at 5:59 for dinner or risk waiting 45 minutes for a table.  (and there is not waiting area or bar) That part is not fun.  But, the food is very good.  I love the cheeses they offer.  The Gorgonzola mess is addictive!  I always get one of their pastas and haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"1st time brunch at Pittsburg & it's great!!! The place is small but so cute. We came around 9:15am and is crowded already. The doughs are freshly made (all ingredients are FRESH) donuts are A MUST! I heard the pasta dishes are also good, but I have no space anymore after the bagel plate LOL. The portion is huge and each dish is around $12 so not too bad. Remember it's CA$h ONLY for brunch~ the decorations are so home like. In general,it's a great place for brunch, might need to wait if you come later ~"}
{"text":"Good here is pretty good if you are a sandwich salad type person.  However the prices are high for the portions.  They make a pretty bomb grilled brussle sprout salad though.  Also, be sure to drop by between class change times, otherwise you'll be stuck in a HUGE line."}
{"text":"My first experience here was great. The food was on point - had the eggplant app and whitefish puttanesca. I definitely wanted to come back again soon. 

The next time I went the host was EXTREMELY rude.  He told us the wait was 1.5 hrs for 5 people, which is fine. But his attitude he was really saying \"why would you even ask that, you should leave right now\".  Probably won't got back now after that experience."}
{"text":"I visited Pittsburgh this past weekend and finally got to try E2's brunch. It has been on my list of \"must try\" places in the city for some time, I've heard so many good things. The staff at E2 definitely did not disappoint. 

Lucky for us, there wasn't a line outside (thanks, polar vortex). The dining room is small, and feels exclusive without seeming at all pretentious. We were promptly seated and ordered some really good coffee. We tried an order of the berry compote/powdered sugar donuts and they were fantastic. And generously portioned! They come 5 to an order which were more than enough for our party of 3 to share.

I split the steak sandwich with my husband, along with the biscuits and chorizo gravy (which was more of a spicy chili). Both items were delicious. And again, very large portions. I really wasn't expecting so much food. Everything is really reasonably priced considering the freshness and food quality. I wish I could've tried everything!

I'll definitely return on my next trip to the Burgh. I'd really love to try dinner!"}
{"text":"We ventured out to Highland Park to try E2, and I was so excited to try this place!  Previous visitors questioned the staff, but the hostess and waiters we encountered were absolutely lovely- no attitude there!  E2 doesn't take reservations, but on a Friday night at 730, we only waited for 30 minutes before being seated.  We were able to crack open the bottle of wine we brought at the downstairs \"bar\" while we waited, so the 30 minutes certainly went by quickly.  We started with the grilled proscuitto, stuffed with mozzarella and garnished with a fresh tomato sauce and parsley.  Although I loved the crispy smokey flavor, there wasn't nearly enough tomato sauce (for my taste) to cut the saltiness (-1).  The parsley garnish was a fresh and unexpected addition to these very traditional Italian flavors (+1), but not enough to save the dish for me.  We then moved on to the campanelle (with corn and pancetta) and one of the evening's specials, the gemelli (with fresh greens, pancetta, and sausage).  Both pasta dishes were actually absolutely delicious.  The homemade sausage, flavored with fennel and grilled to a crispy perfection, along with the greens, added a great textural dimension to the dish.  (And who doesn't love bacon or pancetta in their pasta?)  The pasta itself was wonderfully cooked (aldente) and the serving size was definitely enough for 2 meals! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to the food scene in Pittsburgh. I've only been here for brunch, and it features creative and artisanal dishes at great prices. The beignets are delicious as well and reasonably priced at $5 for a bag. I love that the menu is constantly changing and that the chefs are willing to experiment with different flavors/ingredient combinations. Definitely give this place a shot for brunch. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My workplace rented out the basement event space for our holiday party on a December Sunday, and the space was a great size for our party of 50 or 60.  My S.O. and I don't eat out for Italian food often, as I find it relatively easy to replicate at home, but E2 surprised us with its extreme deliciousness.

The appetizers we were served included 4 types of crostini, a tasty tuna chunk-topped variety, an anchovy-topped, a delightfully sweet pepper selection, and a smoked salmon with egg salad that was my favorite bite of the night.  There may have also been some polenta bites or something-or-other in the starch family, but I was too busy stalking the lox to give it much notice.

Entrees were served family style and included a pasta and meatballs dish, a cappelletti dish, pasta carbonara, roasted beets and carrots with charred broccoli, and a salad that I just didn't have time for, although I'm sure it was tasty.  All the pasta dishes were sinfully good, but it was the sweetest beets I've ever had that blew me away.

All in all, we're a picky inner-food industry bunch, and we had nothing but good remarks.  I will definitely be back to try their normal dinner or brunch menu."}
{"text":"Have only been here for brunch. I should say up front that I am giving this place 4 stars for the donuts. If I hadn't ordered them, I'd probably be giving it a 3.

Even coming for brunch at 10am, we still had to wait close to an hour to get a table for just 3 people. The coffee and tea they provided during the wait were a nice touch, but seriously, how early do you have to get up to beat the crowd?

The donuts we ordered were the rosemary-lemon (delicious) and the sriracha. The latter were out. of. this. world. Crispy yet fluffy donuts are coated in a magical sriracha sauce that puts boring buffalo to shame. And it came with an incredible blue cheese dip. So, so good. Going to be thinking of those for a while.

The actual main dish I had was pretty disappointing. I got the deep-fried risotto cake. The cake had been smothered in a frankly bland tomato sauce to the point that I could no longer tell it had been fried - all crispness was lost. It was altogether too much sauce and it felt very gooey overall. There were other veg options - perhaps I just got unlucky."}
{"text":"E2 has been on my brunch hit list for a long time, and I finally made it over the Sat. before last.  The occasion was that some friends decided to get together with me one last time before I leave PGH for good.  Having called ahead of time to check, I knew that they weren't too busy, so I suggested that we head over to try it, and they assented.

After a 15 min. wait during which we enjoying complimentary hot beverages and checked out the bakery next door, we were seated out front.  Having read the previous reviews, I knew that the donuts were popular and mentioned this to my friends.  We ordered the berry white donuts to share ($6), which are powdered donut holes topped with a berry compote.  They were absolutely delicious, and were most definitely the highlight of the meal!  The donuts were of the cake variety and were rather dense, and the compote was a nice consistency--not too thick or thin, but just right, made from real fruit and its juices.

For our entrees, one of my friends ordered the biscuit and gravy ($12), whereas my other friend and I both ordered the breakfast flatbread with bacon ($13).  The flatbread resembled a sauceless pizza and was topped with eggs, ricotta cheese, mixed greens, and small pieces of thick cut bacon.  The flavors, which were surprisingly muted, were enhanced by the addition of arrabbiata sauce served on the side, which had a bright tomato flavor enhanced by a slight kick of heat.  Initially, my friend was a bit surprised by the non-traditional nature of the biscuit and gravy, which resembled chili in texture and flavor.  He quickly warmed up to it, however, and enjoyed it, despite that it wasn't exactly what he had in mind when he ordered it.

E2 is a small restaurant, so it was nice to be able to take advantage of the pleasant weather to brunch al fresco.  As others have mentioned, it's BYOB, but we weren't able to take advantage of this policy because my friends were driving.  Overall, it was definitely an enjoyable brunch, and if I were staying in PGH, I'd definitely return to try some more of their delicious entrees--and donuts!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Best Brussels sprouts I've had and can't go wrong with their spaghetti and meatballs."}
{"text":"e2 was my first Pittsburgh brunch adventure, and I enjoyed it. First off, the atmosphere was exactly what every brunch venue should be. The tables scrawled with Italian phrases, a pastry menu titled \"OMG I'm so hungry\" and signed with \"xoxo,\" and a front that opens out to a patio, so that even if you're sitting inside you get the sunlight and a nice breeze...everything was ridiculously cute. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, and service was prompt.

Everything, and I mean everything on the menu sounded incredible. I struggled deciding what to order, but ended up getting poached eggs with a salad, roasted tomatoes, and a side of bacon. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the poached eggs. The yolks were cooked solid?  Everything else, however, was perfect. The salad was very lightly dressed with bleu cheese and walnuts, perfect for breakfast, and the roasted tomatoes were delicious. Did I mention the bacon? I was having a serious bacon craving and this really hit the spot. Just enough grease, just enough crunch, and just enough seasoning. I hadn't had bacon this good in a long time. While my choice was good, I was very jealous of my boyfriend's meal. The carbonara he ordered may have been the best I have ever tasted, and I'm picky about my pasta. We also ended up getting a bag o' donuts (so cute!) to go, and they were fresh and piping hot. The ginger flavor was unexpected and gave them a little kick.

The only reason I can't love this place is the high prices...our brunch, with coffee and aranciata, came to over $40. I'm willing to pay for a good brunch at an upscale restaurant but the dishes were fairly simple and the portions weren't very big. Overall, I just didn't feel the prices matched the ultra-casual quaint cafe ambiance. After eating brunch at several other spots in Pittsburgh, I'm just not sure e2 is really worth my money, but I will probably be back again for the donuts."}
{"text":"Decent food, terrible service.

We came here after reading an article that said this was a good place to get brunch. The article was wrong. Place was extremely hot, we had to wait 20 min to get a table and another 20 minutes to order our food. Waitress didn't bring our orange juice, forgot to refill my coffee, did not refill our water and took too long to bring the check. 

Brunch is cash only."}
{"text":"A charming setting in a neat niche neighborhood, this restaurant is the very picture of a brunch spot. We arrived for brunch at around 11. There was no wait. Our wiatress promptly poured us the much needed coffee. The OMG-ISH! menu was a cute touch. We shared the beignets, which were hot and airy, perhaps the high point of the meal.

Because we started so well, The rest of our meal was disappointing in contrast. We ordered four dishes: blood orange bread pudding with goat cheese and balsamic; polenta with red pepper sauce; farmer's pie; and an omelet with sausages. I sampled all four plates, and none of them was a success. The preparation was on the dry side (e.g., overcooked eggs) and not  enough seasoning was used. The kitchen seems to have a thing for making piles of soft food -- One item on the menu is called \"mush\" and another has the word \"mess\" in it's description. It's tongue in cheek, of course, but there is some truth to it too. I really do feel that some textural contrast would improve our meal significantly (for example, the polenta could have been lightly grilled for some crunchiness).

I wanted to like E2 because it has the potential to be such an awesome brunch place. It's a pity that the food was disappointing."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have excellent dinner and brunch menus, and the ambiance is casual but nice. It's a little expensive but worth it, and it's BYOB, which is great. It is a small area, though, and they're often very busy and only take reservations for 6 people or more, so be prepared to wait a bit or plan to come at less popular times."}
{"text":"Brunch review: we love donuts, and since this is one of E2's specialties, I've been trying to get here for awhile.

We got the Berry White Donuts- powered sugar and berry compote: pretty good cakey donut, we both agreed that they were OK. It would be nice if we could mix/match some donuts (1/2 this, 1/2 that), but it's not allowed. 
I got the Mush- polenta with maple syrup, bacon and sausage. This dish was pretty good, and I thought each component was tasty. 
He got the Housemade Bialy- salmon, capers, egg and chili cream cheese. It comes deconstructed and he enjoyed it very much.

Overall, a solid restaurant in a cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was great... the atmosphere awesome... the service was just as good! However, being the middle of July, it was not just hot outside, but quite hot inside as well. Our party was not ready to call it an evening, but we had to leave due to how uncomfortable it was. They had a mounted air unit right above us, but you couldn't even feel the effects of it. Maybe some simple ceiling fans would help get the air moving.
We will definitely be back, just not during summer hours."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant in a sleepy neighborhood, across the nicely named Smiling Banana Leaf. The interior is simple and small -- perhaps 8-10 tables. Brunch items are listed on the blackboard; appetizer like items called OMGs come on the menu. 

We went there for Sunday brunch on a chilly November day. I got the polenta with peppernata & fried eggs, and my lovely girlfriend got the omelet special. Both of these were very good along with coffee. Our server was also friendly and coffees were filled regularly.

On the negative side, they were out of the zeppoli, which I looked forward to having in addition to our brunch items. The interior was very cold, especially when the outside door was open; there was a small heater by us which was good at heating itself and not much else.

We would definitely go there again, but we hope we can taste the zeppoli and the restaurant is warmer."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the grilled romaine salad (the shaved parmesan added a nice salty touch), the mushroom ravioli (delicious, rich), and a cherry crostata (pie) a la mode. All very tasty. The crust on the crostata was excellent. Arriving at 6pm on a Friday evening, there was no wait. Good service. The dining room is acoustically loud and a touch cold, on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"This location has not closed!!

Excellent excellent food and atmosphere. 

Their bagels and locks were fantastic and the Zeppoles, which are little homemade donuts with frosting on top were heavenly. 

The entire trip was awesome, like I said. This place is NOT closed."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, I was ALL ABOUT IT.

Their chai is so legit and that coupled w/ their SUPER CHEAP and SUPER BOMB hummus plate - my poor college student self was good to go (It was $3, a great deal for the amount you got... especially when you're on the all M&G meal plan like I am). I was the happiest kid on campus.

Then I walk in one day and see that they switched their wondrously soft pita for what I can only guess is a disgusting piece of extremely stale and disgustingly dry triangle piece of tortilla that felt like it had been sitting in the sun for years. My heart broke.

E^SQUARED! If you're reading this, switch back to the old pita! If not... I'm afraid I'll have to go back to my usual diet of chunky strawberry yogurt/oatmeal blends at Jamba Juice.

Where can an ASU student get some healthy food that actually tastes good on campus?!?!?"}
{"text":"After a few failed attempts to actually eat here I've had two successes. And it is so good! The first time we tried to come we were scoffed at for possibly thinking a table could be obtained after 8:30. That ruffled our feathers- we didn't know it was so busy- and it took a while for us to go back. I regret that. e2 is insanely amazing!

Remember that is it byob and bring something delicious. Both times we've brought a heavy red with success. The fritters to start are so good- melt in your mouth fluffy with a saffron aioli and green onions.

Porcini cappelletti was my entree choice both times because I couldn't choose anything that sounded better than what I had had the first time. Pasta. Mushrooms. Peas. Prosciutto. Marscarpone. It's really so so good. Boyfriend has gotten the special and loved it both times. Last one had anchovies, spaghetti, chilies, and micro greens. 

I feel like we've missed out on some amazing meals because it took us so long to make it here! Oh well though. We can make up for it now. Seriously it's so good. Next up we will try the brunch."}
{"text":"Oh.  My.  Goodness.

I am a lover of brunch and Enrico's just secured a place in my heart.  Their new Highland Park location is exactly what Pittsburgh needed, and best of all, it is in walking distance to my house (and a lot of others).

First of all, the menu consists of ~10 plates and 6 sides.  Most of the plates are different combinations of fresh greens, eggs, polenta, pasta, sausage, bacon, focaccia and cheese!  I had a frisee salad with fried egg, bacon and foc and it was perfect.  The greens were a wonderful highlight to a snowy pittsburgh day.  My partner had a similar plate but without the bacon and add roasted tomatoes.  Hers was also good but we would have prefered the tomato warm (& in season, but what can you do).  The coffee was perfect and organic/fair trade from a co-op in Nicaragua.

The decor was simple, and made good use of the space and re-found chairs, tables and benches.  There was great light from the front and I can't wait to eat out on the porch.

They have a great kids menu and a small menu of \"OMG I'm hungry!\" items, that consists of some perfect Sugar/Ginger donuts that we took to go.

Hoping this stays a Highland Park secret and the Shadysiders will stay to their side of the busway!"}
{"text":"For reasons which I am unable to divine, E2 is listed in the Mediterranean category. Maybe that's the dinner menu, because the brunch has nothing Mediterranean about it. It is, however, awesome.

Let me suggest opening up with the beignets. They are five to an order and are absolutely fantastic; hot, airy, and sweet, covered with powdered sugar. They're always on the menu, which tends to change up with the seasons. There's no real wrong thing to order here; there's usually some kind of polenta, omelet, and hash on the menu and you can't go wrong with any of those. Even the side order of sausage that I sometimes get here is excellent. The portions are deceptively large, by which I mean that the food comes in giant plates that make the food itself seem small by comparison. But you're not going to leave this place hungry. The bread that comes with most orders is also really great.

Be advised that E2 fills up for brunch, especially on Sundays. In my view, the best time to come here is on Saturday before 11; they're usually not that busy then, although the later crowd will fill it up by noon."}
{"text":"\"R2D2\"... \"E2\" cool! \"Uhm...no genius, E squared\" HB corrected.
 OOOH! I'm quite the nerd! On our way to Smiling Banana leaf we stumbled on E2. There was a sweet couple just leaving and they highly approved of their evening.

BYOB already in hand for dining at the banana,  E2 BYOB,  A OK lets go!
I will be back to SBL but HB was having some BF troubles so it was her pick. She wanted pasta and I'll eat anything! This place is not just for brunch. I got the impression that they have a fast changing menu offering fresh produce that changes with the seasons. The special menu board had many options.

It is cute as pie in there too. We sat at a banquette along the wall at around 8:30 on a Wednesday night. The chalkboard looking tables with handwritten Italian script, low lights for intimate dining, and fresh English garden looking center pieces. Bellissimo!

The server was nice and prompt offering advice and getting to the matter of opening our wine for the $6 fee. Seen cheaper. Still better than a $30 bottle that you find in the store for $10.

I wanted to try the butter squash with chevre starter but HB wanted boring salad. \"Whatever...get what you want\" I complained but going to lose points as a dining partner if you're not more courageous! She decided on the walnut, beet, arugula, and blue cheese salad. I know I should have tried the BC but I had my heart set on chevre and they made the switch for me without a word. I just crave the sweet crunchy beets mixed with that creamy goat cheese, plus the nuts. I go NUTZ! Soo good! HB doesn't like beets so she left them all for me to enjoy.

For our entrees. Huge meatball dish from the next table over Ho! I am big fan of meatballs and I wanted to try. I was debating between the Oxtail and polenta dish vs the spaghetti and meatballs. Oxtail great menu choice but can be fatty so that's why I was questioning?? The choice was made for me as they only had a half order of the meatballs left. So there it was. HB decided on the Rigatoni alla Bolognese.

I don't know if anyone likes to play chef in the kitchen at home but I do and last time I made my famous football chili I added Oxtail. It is a pricey, flavorful meat on the bone yet quite fatty. It requires a long braising or slow cooker time to allow for the melt in your mouth taste. The point is that the fat needs to be addressed. My oxtail polenta dish was just that. Tender bites, a little fatty but not the gristley type. The sauce was thick with nice sized chunks of carrots. Herb seasoned and buttery polenta worked so well in the mix.I ate it all because \"this is not a take home sort of dish\" I told HB. Haha I just wanted to finish it off without the look. I did have a couple bites of her Bolognese and I would have thoroughly appreciated hers as well. Dessert? No room but I will be back to try the BEIGNETS! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with family and while it's has a cute ambiance, I wasn't blow away by the food.  It was good, but not great.  I can't even remember what I ate...not a great sign.  The beignets...not sure what all the raves are about...they were ok, but I've had better."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Thursday evening for dinner with my girlfriend.  The inside of the restaurant is actually quite intimate as I counted only 26 seats and all of the appetizers and desserts are on a chalkboard on one side of the dining room.
 
My girlfriend and I decided to start off our meals by ordering the pickled vegetables and heirloom tomatoes.  Since I do not enjoy tomatoes at all,  I was eagerly looking forward to the pickled vegetables.  They came to our table together with a large side of slightly toasted bread and at $3 each seemed to be a bargain.  Whenever I looked at the pickled vegetables though I became confused as the pickled vegetables was actually pickled vegetable (taking the s off of the chalkboard should have been easy enough) and not one that I had any knowledge of.  Since I am an adventurous eater I dove into it anyways and found it to be quite good when it had some of the freshly cracked pepper on it but a bit bland without.  After both appetizers were finished the server came back to collect the dishes and I was able to find out that I had eaten some Kohlrabi.  For my entree I decided upon the spinach tortellini with chicken.  I was once again surprised whenever it came as the chicken was dark meat and not the chicken breast that I had been picturing.  While I am not against dark meat and ended up enjoying it, the presentation of it on top sort of ruined what was otherwise a beautiful dish with the green spinach tortellinis, white pine nuts and flecks of red pepper in the sauce.  Overall the dish was excellent.  The tortellinis had a good tasting filling inside and the softness of them paired well with the slightly crunchy pine nuts while the small amount of chile in the sauce gave it an extra dimension.
 
The bottom line for me is that I would definitely come here again in the future.  My entree was delicious and it seems like a place that is willing to experiment a bit with food.  Next time I will probably bring a bottle of wine as well as this is a BYOB place with a $6 corkage fee."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch this past Sunday having heard raving reviews about it. I had the omlette and my friend had the mush. The omlette was average at best - the egg portion was dry, the cheese wasn't fully melted within, and the flavor wasn't anything special. The salad it came with was great. The Mush on the other hand was unique and delicious! It was the perfect blend of sweet and savory. I'm not usually a fan of polenta, so I was unexpectedly pleased by it.  We also had the doughnuts (bag of d's and the berry whites) which were ok, but much harder/denser than what I expected. 

Overall I was underwhelmed, but loved that mush! I would come back for a second bite."}
{"text":"OK so here's the executive summary.  The food and kitchen is amazing, and variety and quality of the brunch food is top notch DESPITE the servers attempts to sabotage the experience it as it left the kitchen.  I will tilt the star rating heavily in favor of the kitchen and minimize the servers attempt to tank the experience! 

So we went for brunch on a rainy weekend so that meant no sitting on their lovely sunny outside area and hence less people inside (to serve).  Unless your very lucky, you will put your name on the list and wait downstairs in the basement (with coffee/tea).  The coffee was empty save for a 1/2 cup we managed to pour out, so two times I have been there we haven't seen much attention on the coffee but at least they provide it.

We were seated within 10 minutes.  Our table was near the kitchen door and our chair was bumped a few times by wait staff.  There were three servers for the small space and it was brunch so I didn't think there were that many tables per server.  She arrived with a smile as we ordered donuts and tea.  She frowned when we told her we just sat down and needed time for the rest of the menu.  The tea was forgotten after someone else set down the donuts.  The donuts were amazing .. I so recommend you have these before you order the rest.  Linger over them with coffee and forgotten tea. (The tea showed up after our meal after we asked for someone else to get it) .. its a bag placed in your mug so its not like tea service or anything.

There was a great variety of entrees to chose from .. very creative but you can find close to standard type brunch here and eat very well.  You can order sides of bacon and other things but I found the entrees very satisfying and complete.  We didn't get offers to fill up the coffee.  We were basically ignored by our waitress.  There was definitely some reluctant service going on in the small space BUT like I said god bless the kitchen for putting out great looking and tasting plates.  The lack of good service does take the motivation down to return despite loving the food.

Try it .. hope you don't experience the terrible service we did but its one of the best brunch places despite this."}
{"text":"Hello Highland Park!  Wow, E2, a hidden and wonderful find for brunch this past Sunday.  Our group of about 10 was given a large farm table in the basement.  There is a bar set up so you can serve yourself coffee or tea.  The room is rustic and fun.  Rustic and fun, two words that don't normally go together.  Rustic because of the decor, fun because they played old school country music.  
Onto the food.  We ordered an array of delicious donuts, both of the sweet and savory persuasion.  Five dollars for four perfectly cooked donuts per order.  Yum-o!
I ordered the smoked salmon that was served with a spring mix salad with walnuts.  The smoked salmon had capers and a light cream served on top of egg.  Seriously amazing.
Take a trek to Highland Park, Bryant Street is vibrant with a lot of locals walking around and the street is aligned with cute little shops.  I need to explore this area of town again, with E2 being a huge draw."}
{"text":"Eat here now! 
This is the restaurant I always choose for special occasions and each time it is flawless and keeps me coming back. I love that the menu changes, you know what you're getting is fresh and that the chef really cares about the ingredients he is using to make the best plates. I find they have a great mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. We had a large party and we decided on the prix fixe menu in which the wave the corkage fee. So many courses, including dessert and worth every penny!! 

E2 is BYOB which is fun. The ambiance is perfect and the wait staff are very friendly and seem to know everything about the menu items and if they don't, they never hesitate to ask the chef for clarification. Favourite restaurant in Pittsburgh for a nice meal :)"}
{"text":"Perfect neighborhood joint to walk to for brunch. Noisy. Tight seating. Often a wait. Beware of deep fried doughnuts & beignets -- quite tasty if hot hot hot. (Nasty if not not not!) Seems to have a constant brunch menu that doesn't change much even if it is chalkboard based. Frittatta, quiche, omelet, french toast, farmer's egg platter, etc. Most served with a decent portion of spring mix salad and burnt-grilled Italian bread. Satisfying and reasonably priced  between $10-$12 per dish with additional sides ata $4-$6. Food is locally sourced. The Polenta Pepperanata has a tasty sauce that is heightened if the egg is cooked correctly, over easy or soft. But often egg dishes here are over-cooked. The Risotto cakes are tasty. The Italian hoagie seems to sell well, tastes of quality ingredients, but otherwise is just an Italian hoagie."}
{"text":"Excellent, casual restaurant.   Great, creative food, and a wonderful atmosphere.  The menu seemed a little light on choices, but it also seems that it changes frequently, so I can forgive that.  Nevertheless, there was something for everyone.  

The one thing that kept me from giving this place the full 5-star rating was that the corkage fee was a bit high at $6 per person."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. Great breakfast!! Loved that they have a waiting area down stairs with coffee and tea. We shared the Sriracha zeppollis which were awesome and had the brussel bacon hash and farmers breakfast. Done very well! Cute and small atmosphere. Wait staff is very nice! Menu is pretty cool so I am looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Great brunch - fun and interesting spot with delicious and flavorful food. To start we have homemade lemon Rosemary donuts that were fantastic followed by a frittata that was perfectly done - the service was neighborhood friendly and efficient - thumbs up all around."}
{"text":"Two of our friends brought my fiance and I to E2 as a treat when we visited Pittsburgh. It was a beautiful day, and we got to sit outside and sip on some BYOB wine. The staff was so sweet, and even opened up our bottle of wine while we waited. The porcinni was to die for, as was the ravioli. At some point we decided to go family style because we wanted a taste of every item. Even if you're full, get the beignets.

We were so impressed with E2, we looked into having our rehearsal dinner there, but it books up quickly for big events. The only negative would have to be the location, as there's not as much to do in the area."}
{"text":"I've had two events here in their downstairs space(July 2014 and Dec 2012) as well as frequented them many times for brunch and dinner. It's a gem of highland park which you MUST make time to visit.

The personal attention and quality of service from the event coordinator is extraordinary. For example at the most recent event we knew in advance there would be wine at the table, so there were buckets with ice on the table when we arrived. Wine glasses on the table. He called the day of to ask me if he should put champagne glasses out. But when one of the guests unexpectedly arrived with almost a full bar of supplies for mixed drinks, the staff set up a bar station on the counter with extra glasses and extra nice without even being asked. Kate is an amazing chef and some of the best Italian food me and my half-italian gentleman companion have ever eaten. Every course was better than the next. I still dream about the farro salad. 

Go there for brunch, dinner, or plan a family gathering or party. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our second visit to this restaurant was less than impressive. We went for breakfast, they had no milk for kids or milk substitute to add to the coffee. The menu is small - read limited - and there's only \"one\" traditional breakfast option at this restaurant. The \"toast\" is some weird, thick and served as cold as the eggs, the kids served last (which didn't go over well for hungry kids made to wait almost 40 minutes for food after ordering) and the wait and front door staff - lukewarm and couldn't answer questions about the menu very well. Oh and did I mention - they only accept cash? No credit or debit cards :("}
{"text":"This place is beyond great. Every time I've been there 3 or 4 times for dinner and sadly, only once for brunch (sometimes it's hard to get motivated to leave on a Sunday morning). The food is simple, unpretentious, and absolutely delicious. I swear they have a warehouse of the perfectly grilled bread they serve - it just keeps coming! An absolute must for anyone, couple, or small group."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service from the beginning (instead of waiting in a crowded foyer or outside on a cold, damp Pittsburgh day, you wait in a basement with benches and free coffee/tea) to the very end of our meal. I'm not a doughnut person, but if E2 can turn me, then it can turn you too.

Our table had the berry white doughnuts (delicious and fresh with just the right amount of sweetness), sriracha zeppollis (OMG I do not have words-- yummy, spicy and parmesan-y), and the beignets (simple but light and fluffy). Dessert before breakfast? E2 can make that happen.

I had the press plate and it was great, met my expectations, but honestly all I could think about was more doughnuts. The polenta was extremely popular in our group-- I'm not personally a huge fan, but I tried the polenta pepperonata and the sauce was incredible. Also, making a mental note to try the french toast next time. If you're within a twenty mile radius of Highland Park, come and give E2 a chance for brunch. It won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, fabulous service, cool vibe.  We dined here this weekend  for dinner with 6 other friends and we had the entire downstairs to ourselves (which was perfect, because we tend to be a loud bunch when we all get together). The OMG menu is delish- especially the hummus. The main entrees and fabulous too-- shrimp risotto was devine and the mussles were juicy and tender. Oh, and it's BYOB, which is always a nice feature. :)

The location is a huge plus as well-- it is nestled in the Highland Park neighborghood near a few other shops/bakeries/ect.  It has a hip, San Fran vibe. I have a good feeling about this area of the neighborhood and can't wait to return for the much talked about brunch!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had brunch here today and it was rather mediocre. The zucchini risotto was incredibly over cooked and the french toast was tasty, but nowhere near as good as what Dozen (sad) used to make. The atmosphere is cute, but the acoustics are terrible. It's a small space with lots of people...it gets loud.

Also, the wait staff were generally okay, but, for lack of a better term, uninterested. We asked for more hot water for our tea and it came promptly, but the waitress sat it down while turning her back to us to take care of something else. She did the same a few other times. Nothing major, but it just didn't give off a very warm and friendly vibe."}
{"text":"The beignets are delicious! I love the food here and the atmosphere and service is always great. I do wish they took credit cards though."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch, and fell in love with their donuts. Perfectly crispy on the outside, soft and doughy on the inside, and delicious all over. We got the Lemon lavender donuts and I want to make it a mission to try all of them. I wish I had tried the savory donuts but the entree was so filling I couldn't go for another round. 

I got the brussels with bacon which was okay. It was more greasy than I had expected, but I mean...bacon. Definitely want to come back here for more, possibly their dinner instead of brunch. I believe that they're more adventurous with their dinner menu. While their brunch menu was good, it was pretty plain, good ol' hearty amurican food."}
{"text":"Two friends and I were here a feww weeks ago for brunch... they were close to closing, but they sat us before our last party arrived. Everyone was very friendly and fun! The menu was hard to choose - it all sounded great! I ended up getting a polenta dish with pecans, syrup, and bacon. It was good, but pretty sweet and more of a savory person. Their homemade doughnuts (forget what the Italian version is called) were to die for!! I'll definitely get back here next time I'm in Pitt. The dinner menu looked delicious too!"}
{"text":"Who would think that one would walk into a restaurant and think maybe one can get something to eat. Not here. Extremely rude person just barked at us for walking in the door. Rudely said we don't have any table for you and walked away. Rudest experience ever. Will never go there. Will be calling manager tomorrow."}
{"text":"Just went there for brunch and was extremely impressed! My only complaint was the wait time. We got there at 11:15am and did not get seated until 12:30pm. HOWEVER, they have a wonderful waiting area downstairs with free coffee and tea. My friends and I were able to sit and relax, so the time went by quickly.

The food was incredible. Our waitress was so helpful and brought their home-made doughnuts to our attention. We had the Caramel Pecan doughnuts, and they were perfect! Slightly crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.

I had the Saute, which I highly recommend. The veggies were cooked perfectly, and the seasonings were as well.

We will definitely be heading back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and i both ordered the patatas bravas for brunch. The portions were generous and the food was delicious and savory. I imagine this would be a great hangover cure. We wanted to get some donuts too but we were just too full. Would definitely like to try the beignets and other goodies from the $5 menu next time though!"}
{"text":"Very good brunch, especially the donuts!  \"Lavender Lemon\" donuts!  I had also gotten their \"Kale and White bean hash.\"  It was pretty good.  Ambiance is nice, very quaint.  The restaurant is much, much smaller than I had expected, so if you go at a busy time, expect to wait!  Wait staff was super pleasant."}
{"text":"SETTING
Small and intimate. If there is a wait, you can make your way downstairs into their huge basement. There, they have complimentary coffee or tea and a super large table to sit at. The drinks are self serve and you can bring them upstairs once you get called. 

FOOD
There are 2 menus, one for their donuts and the other for their entrees.  

For donuts we got the Chocolate Espresso and also the Zeppolli. Have these donut holes been working out? They were huge! Came in about 5-6 pieces per plate. The Chocolate Espresso looked super rich, but it was only coated with chocolate and not chocolate in its entirety. I was expecting it to be soft, but these were a bit more dense (you can stick a fork in it and cut it). The Zeppolli had a chewy and starchy texture. Came with a side of marinara sauce (much needed or it would taste too dry).

From the other menu, we went for the Patatas Bravas which had sliced chorizo with sauteed red potatoes, onions, red peppers, and fresh greens. A spicy sauce dressed it up and there was an egg and toast on top. Good sized portion.

SERVICE
Kind and patient staff who explained their menus very well. Kept waters filled and we never felt like we needed to wait for anything. Came by a few times to check on us.

IMPRESSIONS
If you are with another person, one entree and one donut dish is plenty enough to share. Definitely a unique place where you can get your hands on some gourmet donuts and filling entrees. I preferred the chocolate to the Zeppolli. The Patatas Bravas was pretty good, but I felt the spiciness took over the dish a little too much. Plenty of chorizo and all the fixins made me a happy camper. Everything tasted okay, but for some reason I had higher expectations. I do want to come back, though, to try other donuts and entrees because E2 is definitely a unique spot.

*Cash only"}
{"text":"Our foodie dinner date proved to be successful once again, this time at e2.  If I didn't have my GPS I would have drove right past it,  but I'm thrilled I didn't. 

We brought some tasty adult beverages and ordered some app.  Mix & match of course.  Their OMG! items are incredibly delicious... you must try their Gorg Mess!  Cheesey yet spicy... just try it and thank  me later.  I also ordered their salad special: Grilled Escarole.  I've never had a grilled salad before, but I not salivate at the thought.

For dinner we faced some difficult decisions... Friends ordered the ricotta ravioli which was savory and a hint of sweet.  Incredible!  Another ordered the Capanelli which looked amazing.  However I'm a mushroom fan and ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli.  Oh that earthy flavor :)  If you love mushrooms like I do, please order this dish!  Yum!

For dessert we had to order some doughnuts and chocolatey goodness... unfortunately we ate them all before we could take photos... whoops!  Needless to say, they completed a delicious meal.

I may not have found e2 if I had not heard such great things, but I am so thankful we went.  I cannot wait to go back and try something new on their always new, always fresh menu."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while looking for a Mediterranean restaurant - for some reason it's classified as Mediterranean, but I think this leans much more toward the \"Italian\" side than Mediterranean.  Nonetheless, this is a nice BYOB ($6 uncorking fee) restaurant in the Highland Park area of Pittsburgh.

We started off with an \"OMG\" (as they call it) antipasto - it's made to order, and we selected the salami, Gorgonzola cheese, marinated olives and roasted eggplant. It was crisp, fresh, and very good. 

The antipasto also came with a toasted bread with garlic and butter, perfect for dipping in one of their sauces but more than delicious by itself. 

My wife ordered a chicken dish which came in a creamy tomato sauce - she was very satisfied, and described it as \"hearty.\"

I had the campanelle - a dish with pasta, chick peas, spicy sausage, roasted peppers, and steamed spinach. It was absolutely delicious. 

The service was excellent - our waiter Adam was very attentive, extremely helpful, and handled a large section with the utmost efficiency. 

My only gripe with the entire experience was the extremely loud volume in the dining room throughout the meal - not from the music or restaurant, but from the patrons. The restaurant is a converted house, and as a result the front dining room is a bit cramped. Most of the tables in this room are set up for two guests, but there are two tables in opposite corners that can accommodate parties of up to 6. When these large parties occupy the dining room, the noise become such that they wind up having to yell over each other to speak, which in turn drowns out everyone else's conversation. This could be avoided if they had a separate larger rooms to seat larger parties (downstairs perhaps?). Otherwise, my recommendation is to ask for one of the outdoor patio tables if the weather permits."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about E2. I love the atmosphere, it's cozy and romantic but not crammed. It's minimalist cozy. It's very warm and inviting. 

My boyfriend and I are foodies, so we had to try this place based off of the reviews and pictures. It didn't disappoint! The bread that they give you to start is super fresh and perfect with just the olive oil. We ordered prosciutto wrapped mozzarella that came with some olive oil and tomato sauce. It was perfect! I don't believe that it is on the menu at the moment. The prosciutto didn't have the gamey taste that you can sometimes get, and the mozzarella was super moist. 

For dinner, I got the Parmesan polenta with red wine braised beef with cocoa. It's not on the menu now, but holy cow. I recommend getting any polenta dish they have because they know how to do it. The meat was so tasty and just fell apart in my mouth. The combination of flavors was spot on. 

Of course, we had to get the beignets for dessert. They were nothing short of perfect. I definitely recommend this to anyone. For the amount of food you get, and the price, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"I cannot stop thinking about my brunch experience at E2 to the point that I tried to recreate it at home, failed miserably, and will be going again soon.  Easy to see why Men's Journal named this one of the best brunches in America.

I got there around noon on a Saturday with some of my friends.  The wait was about 45 minutes, but luckily they have a downstairs area you can sit and if you are like my boozy friends, you can pop open your champagne then.  Of course we did, got through one mimosa and our table was ready.  If you didn't catch it yet, E2 is BYOB.

Atmosphere: Super quaint and not overly complicated, feels like it's someone's house.  

Service: Again, not complicated.  Easy, efficient, nice.  Loved it.

Food:  Started with the bacon zeppolli which is basically a bacon stuffed doughnut - aka magic.  My picture doesn't do them justice and I want more of them on a regular basis.  

I got the Patatas Bravas as my entree and this is where I sort of lost it in a good way.  How could both dishes be so perfectly cooked and balanced?  Potatoes were perfect, spicy mayo was tasty, chorizo texture was awesome, fried egg on top was cooked perfectly, salad on the side was a delicious edition.  Only thing I would change would be to get an extra egg because it was so good!  This dish is a bit spicy, so if you are sensitive to that, beware.  

Friends got the \"mush\" and \"press plate\", both were solid.  Patatas Bravas really shined though and as I said, I cannot stop thinking about this.

Overall, this is a fantastic place to spend your brunch time.  Unassuming, not complicated, love it, can't wait to go back for e2 x2."}
{"text":"Went here this past week for my birthday. We had a party of 8 and were fortunate to get reservations for 6pm on a Wednesday. It's a has a small dining area and I would recommend not bringing a large party due to the lack of space. There was only approximately 10 or so tables in the dining room. BYOB with only a $6 corking fee at the time of this review. Bathrooms are in need of a major makeover. 

The food was fantastic and server was helpful in assisting us with what appetizers were best for our size party since everything is a la carte. The grilled romaine salad was deliciously full of flavor as was my entree, the Linguini carbonara with chicken. If you do not like pepper, stay away from this carbonara though. I also thoroughly enjoyed my butternut squash bisque although I thought it needed a little salt. I also tried my husbands lobster and shrimp risotto and sister in laws mushroom ravioli which seemed to be perfectly cooked and seasoned so I highly recommend any of these entrees. Large portions. 

The whole experience was unfortunately tainted by the fact that approximately 20 minutes after paying our check, we were asked to take our wine to their bar/lounge area because they wanted our table to seat other guests. While I can understand the dilemma of them having limited seating, I thought it was distasteful to ask us to leave especially when we were finishing our wine and just paid $325 for dinner. 

Overall, I think this place offers a fantastic meal and intimate atmosphere. Unfortunately, my experience was tainted by being asked to move from our table. That being said, I would likely return to give them another chance because the food was so good."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5 (split between 3 for brunch and 4 for dinner)
Ambiance: 2
Service: 3.5

We have been here multiple times for brunch, which is okay but nothing to write home about.  Generally sizable portions.  We have tried all the donut hole flavors (lemon rosemary is our favorite) and the black pepper/parm zeppolis -- solid but slightly underwhelming given the hype about them. 

We finally came for dinner, and were so glad we did!  A huge step up from brunch.  We came with a large group, were seated pretty close to our reservation time though had to wait downstairs for a bit. The citrus radicchio salad was fresh and the flavors were paired well.  The root vegetable gratin looks small but is chock full of melted cheese (and probably butter) and thus very filling.  The complimentary grilled bread was served with a tangy, pungent Gorgonzola spread (Ms Beffrey loved it, but it was surprisingly polarizing). 

The wild mushroom ravioli was packed with mushroom flavor, though aesthetically not the most appealing.  The Brussels sprouts carbonara was sadly quite light on the sprouts, and served with a thick noodle, but overall tasty (definitely add the sausage!).  The porcini cappelletti was the favorite - decent amount of mushrooms, though the pancetta felt a little lost. All the pasta dishes were delicious, and frankly what we expected for $20 dishes.

The bourbon pecan pie with vanilla ice cream was crunchy and you could taste just a whiff of bourbon.  The vanilla ice cream is smooth and creamy, and (surprise!) is from Trader Joe's!  Points to our server for his honesty. We're going to go stock up on TJ ice cream now.

Ambiance was the biggest gripe for us. It's really just a cramped room, not much separation from neighboring tables. All you will hear is your neighbor's conversation.  We think they're going for a hipster vibe, but it feels drab and slightly dingy.

Regardless, would come back for dinner (and pass on their brunches)."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to bother writing a review because everyone already knows how fantastic they are. When I want truly authentic Italian cuisine, this is where I go. They're menu changes more frequently than I am used to so I can't recommend any entrees. If you can only have appetizers or dessert, like me who can't finish to save my life, definitely get the appetizers. I like choosing the vegetables, cheeses and meats as opposed to a small dish. The bread is hearty, crusty and yummy! I can't say enough about good bread."}
{"text":"I had brunch at E2 a few months ago and, all in all, I wasn't too impressed. In light of yesterday's Post-Gazette review of their dinner offerings, I tried it again. The hostess/waitress, Lauren, was very helpful and welcoming. Other than a large group near the window(s), my friend and I were the only other individuals int he restaurant. As a result, we sat towards the back and we cozy and warm on a snowy winter's night (contrary to the complaints of the establishment being chilly). First off, it's BYOB. : ) The OMGs (i.e. tapas plates) intrigued me. So, I selected the white beans and, for $3, I received about 1/8 of a can of flavorless mushy white beans. The grilled bread was good and in endless supply. I had the mixed greens salad (with beets and gorgonzola) and it was great. I also had the mushroom arancini, a ball of mushrooms, risotto, and mozzarella rolled in panko bread crumbs and flash fried. In a word: DELICIOUS! For dessert, my friend and I tried the Meyer lemon mess. While the citrus was a welcome contrast to the snow outside, it was smothered in whipped cream and a little basic. Both my friend and I gave this place a 6 (out of 10). It's a nice place for din-din during the week, but I would NOT wait to be seated here on a Friday or Saturday night...there are too many better restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Had brunch today. Started with some Oreo beignets with mud sauce. They were novel, fresh and tasty. Also had the all in hash. Brussels sprouts. Peppers, bacon, kale, topped with 2 fried eggs. Finished with a little siracha sauce. Lovely! Cool atmosphere. Friendly wait staff. Overall nice experience. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"A year after I had an unremarkable brunch experience here, I had a really great dinner. It didn't take very long to get a table on a Tuesday night, and the host did a thorough job of telling us the menu specials before our waitress came over. She was very attentive the whole night which was much appreciated. We started with an appetizer that had some sort of gorgonzola spread, soppressata(?), castelvetrano olives, and a tomatoey dip. All delicious! Probably could have eaten their generously toasted bread triangles on their own. I got the fettuccine pescatore and my friend got the mushroom ravioli. Both were extremely flavorful and had lovely presentation. I think their pasta is all made in-house as well, which is kind of integral when that's the focus of the meal. For dessert we had salted caramel apple...something with ice cream. Ahhhh! I saw some people eating it earlier so I was dead set on getting it because, you know, ICE CREAM. It was incredible, especially the caramel part, and I subsequently fell into a deep and satisfying food coma once I got home. If I had one complaint it would be not to drink water out of double shot glasses, because I like to drink a lot of water, I guess--a pretty trivial detail anyhow."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Seriously though I just ate the most delicious meal. I ordered the fried polenta and peppers without any add ons. I was a little nervous because I usually don't eat vegetarian type meals, however, I am so very happy I picked this dish! The flavors were amazing and I'm a huge fan of the goat cheese. Also, the service was fantastic. My grandmother is allergic to dairy and mentioned that to the server who then helped her out by going through the menu quickly and saying what has dairy and what would still be good without dairy. She was just really helpful about everything just like a server should be. I cannot wait to come back especially for the brunch. I am so lucky I live only  a block away and if I had a higher paying job this place would be my go to for sure. 
Food: Amazing!
Server: Great!
Ambience: Perfect!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Very small and cozy place. Only down side is that we were asked to get up so another table could be seated after we spent $315 there! I thought that was extremely rude."}
{"text":"Found this place completely by accident while walking around. Food is fantastic and our server really made the experience. It's such a cool little place. Could not recommend enough."}
{"text":"An entire menu dedicated to donuts? Yes please! Even if you think you don't want them, think again. Unfortunately by the time we arrived they had run out of the donut dough but were able to still get beignets with whichever flavors. We ordered the berry one and it was delicious. And they were so round, big and puffy! It was impossible to just have one...

I ordered the omelette which was basil eggs stuffed with creamy spinach artichoke. I wasn't so sure about the creamy stuffing but it turned out quite nice. The creaminess wasn't overwhelming or too heavy and it was a nice balance with the eggs and the light and refreshing side salad. 

Will definitely return to try more, especially for dinner and BYOB! And overheard about their monthly Sunday dinners, which sounded like a really interesting experience..."}
{"text":"The donuts. The beignets. That's the reason why you should brunch at E2. My favorite is the chocolate pistachio. The doughnut was light and fluffy with the right amount of sauce to cover it. Be sure to bring cash since brunch is cash-only. You won't regret waiting for those steaming, delicious doughnuts!"}
{"text":"E2 is amazing, it is the place where we go when we want to sit down with friends and have an incredible meal that leaves you stuffed and wanting more. The feeling is very cozy and fun, the dining room is the kind of place where you end up chatting with folks at the next table. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait, it's worth it.  Beans & greens, Gorgonzola mess, pretty much everything on the menu.  BYOB is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Went here for a work dinner, and it was magnificent. The Brussel sprouts and goat mess (I think that's what it's called) are a must. I also really enjoyed the risotto balls. I wish I got the lighter seafood dish. I didn't love the winter seafood dish with tomato sauce, but I was also very full from the delicious appetizers. Either way, I will definitely be back. Don't forget to bring a bottle of wine when you come!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! It's BYOB and offers a different unique brunch menu like the Sriracha zeppolis, chocolate and pistachio zeppolis, breakfast hoagie, mush bowl, risotto cakes with eggs etc.  The Sriracha zeppolis served with fresh blue cheese were crazy delicious.  I just want to order that next time. The service was friendly. I wish DC had a spot like this."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this BYOB spot. I'd return just for the roasted chicken, I had with my gnocchi. My husband had a spaghetti dish with a banga cauda type dressing that was delish; the chilies gave it a good kick. The decor is very rough and fun. The staff was friendly and quite helpful."}
{"text":"I used to live in the Highland Park section of Pittsburgh.  I loved living there and I definitely miss all of the great little neighborhood eateries.  On my quest to recapture that loving feeling, my daughter and I recently had brunch here on Sunday after church.

I love bread and anything that resembles bread, so I started us with the zeppolli.   Savory doughnut-like puffs of fried dough, they were reminiscent of beignets from Café Du Monde in New Orleans, but dusted with black pepper and parmesan cheese.  I actually liked them better than the beignets. (I'm more of a savory than a sweet girl.)  I must try the bacon zeppolli next time though, because I also love salty/sweet concoctions
.
For our main meal, I ordered the \"farmer's breakfast\" and my daughter ordered the French toast with a side of bacon.  Both meals were tasty and you could tell that the chef used high quality ingredients.  Ultra-yellow egg yolks and premium bacon.  I don't know who their food purveyor is, but they do a hella job with their supplies.
I personally love the quaintness of the place, but it can be a tight fit and the line can be long getting in.  So if you're hungry and need a quick fix, don't plan on getting in quickly.

I wish that this place was right around the corner from my present home, but alas, it is not so.

Baci to the chef!"}
{"text":"Worth the hype, but either go early or on a weeknight. We tried to go on a Saturday at 6:30 but they were booked for the night!

Ordered the porcini cappelletti based on the server's recommendation and it was delicious. Easily the best dish compared to my other three friends' dishes (lobster risotto and the portobello ravioli was a close second). A huge portion of mini tortellini tossed in slightly creamy tomato. Comfort food but not too rich.

The upside to the wait is a huge bar area downstairs, so make sure you bring enough wine to last through cocktails and dinner!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch, and it was incredible! We ordered the Sriracha zeppolis (sounds weird, I know), the beignets, patatas bravas, and the house made bialy. The entrees were very delicious, but the real star were the donuts we got. The beignets were like pillows, they were so soft and perfectly chewy. The Sriracha zeppolis sound off putting, but they were so good - a bit denser and not too spicy.

Word to the wise: people come here in waves, come here right at 9am and then every 45min or so after that unless you wanna wait for like 25+ mins"}
{"text":"Recently had brunch at E2 with my brother and parents.  This is a great addition to what is becoming one of the coolest restaurant locations in Pittsburgh.  I grew up in Highland Park so I love seeing the development of E2, Banana Leaf, Park Brugge, and Tambellini's all so close to each other.

E2 has a bunch of menu items on a chalkboard and a few starters on small paper menus they give out.  We started with the zappoli with parmasean, black pepper, and anchovies.  It was a tasty and savory way to start off our brunch.  For an entree I went with the pepper polenta with red sauce.  This was also quite flavorful and savory.  My brother loved the \"mush\" with maple \"mess\" on top.  

Our servers were extremely attentive and friendly.  Our coffee mugs were frequently refilled.  E2 is very small (about 10 tables) and no one pressured us to leave despite the big crowd that was gathering outside waiting for tables.

I would love to come back sometime for dinner.  E2 is BYOB and they do not have a liquor license.  They have some outdoor tables that would be a perfect place to grab lunch or dinner in the summer.  

Many businesses have come and gone over the years in this exact location.  I'm hoping that with this new restaurant renaissance taking place in Highland Park, E2 will be here to stay."}
{"text":"Hands down this is one of my favorite restaurants.... ever. And even though I might be young in age, I've dined in over 12 countries and watch an obscene amount of the Food Network so, I know my food. Nothing I've ever eaten here has disappointed me, and it's BYOB, honestly what more can you ask for. Have you ever had mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto, grilled, and served with an amazing red sauce with fresh herbs? No? Well then you should probably think about going to e2 tonight. I also don't think I've ever had a better pasta carbonara, I frequently dream about it, and I can't even get over how well the Brussels sprouts compliment it so beautifully. Or the linguine and clams, or the squash risotto (fall menu), even the farmer green salad with goat cheese and walnuts, everything I've tried has been wonderful. I drive my boyfriend absolutely insane because I have the strongest desire to try every reputable restaurant in Pittsburgh, but I'm having the hardest time moving on from E2, and I don't think want to."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch Saturday on the way to the Zoo. Pretty cramped spot on a Saturday, but we were able to be seated immediately.  The food is good and fresh, although it seemed to take forever to come out. I had the asparagus and bacon hash with eggs on the side.  Also, I tried the donuts because they are homemade. They remind me of beignets but not quite as fluffy and light. Overall I thought the food was good and service polite, but seemed like they had trouble keeping up with the Saturday crowd."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant- great hole in the wall in Pittsburgh. The fried polenta was amazing, tasting wise and display wise. My favorite vegetables are the roasted carrots and grilled artichokes. The meatballs are better than my family's recipe. It's also great that it's BYOB. Great atmosphere and down-to-earth staff."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here twice and the food is fantastic, it's BYOB, and the staff are always friendly. It doesn't get any better than that ... I will be back - a lot!"}
{"text":"Just dined here for brunch and had such a nice morning! We arrived 10 min before they opened at 9, and we were very glad we did because there was a line before they even opened the door.  We were seated immediately.  We brought our own champagne and they supplied fresh orange juice, so we were able to have yummy mimosas! 

We ordered their special donut of the day, honey and sesame seed, we loved them! I ordered the chickpea and chorizo gravy on a biscuit entree (it had a sunny side up egg too), and even though it was a pretty big portion, I ate the entire thing.  It had just the right amount of spice. My mom ordered the arugula and sunny side egg flatbread, she could only eat half, but she also really enjoyed it! 

The service was awesome! Not only were they super efficient (we had OJ and donuts less than a few minutes from sitting down), but very helpful for first timers with the menu. In addition, it was a beautiful, sunny morning and they had the door open to the patio, so the natural light really created a nice atmosphere! The only thing to be aware of is that they're cash only for brunch, but there was an ATM across the street in the market, so no big deal.  I would 100% come back sometime! Maybe for dinner next?"}
{"text":"A few months back, while visiting some friends in Pittsburgh, they took us to E2 for a Saturday brunch.  The dining room was small, but I loved the decor.  It was simple and had a garden feel.  They served water in mason jars and had the menu on a chalk board on the wall.  I ordered the hash special, it was summer time so they had fresh local tomatoes and other veggies in the hash.  There was also small pieces of delightful bacon, and of course the base was potatoes.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals as much as I did and I feel like the pricing was pretty reasonable.  

Next time I am in Pittsburgh, I will request that we return to E2 for another meal!"}
{"text":"So this place is very convenient for me due to its proximity to my classes. I like to get the soup here and think it's a good deal for lunch (4$ for a bowl of soup and a roll). Most of the soups have been good.... minestrone and potato were really good, but the black bean and pumpkin was pretty gross. Also, I got a sandwich here a few months ago and the bread was really chewy and the sandwich was inedible. It was goat cheese and some other things.... which I love, but the bread was terrible! However, their sandwiches now look like they use different breads and actually look a lot more appetizing. Their coffee is alright, but I'd rather go to the coffee shop in the design building (for happy hour!), but yesterday I got a sangria iced tea.... delicious! I will definitely be getting that again. It's tea (black or green) with chopped up apple, orange, and some strawberry (?) juice or something... anyway it tasted great! Anyway, my experiences have been mixed so they get three stars."}
{"text":"Today was proclaimed a Sunday Funday since the weather was beautiful.  Already in a fantastic mood, 5 friends and I headed to E2 for the famed brunch.

It was delicious!!!! Biscotti, polenta, french toast, french press.  Everyone was so in love with their dishes that we were all trying each others to see which was best.

The place is small, charming, cute...everything a brunch spot should be.  Also, seemed very into sustainability and not having a ton of disposables.

The only reason they are not getting a 5 star is because the coffee was disgusting.  I mean disgusting.  Both myself and a friend had coffee grinds and it was super weak.  Maybe just an off day in terms of coffee?"}
{"text":"I'm officially an E2 junkie! After eating there at least once a week for the last three weeks and having an event catered at my house by Kate and Jason, I thought that I'd list my current favorites (and echo some other reviewers).  Meatballs are awesome. I recently said that Kate's tomato sauce may be as good as my mom's (which I'm only writing because she doesn't know what yelp is or else I'd be in serious trouble) and so are her meatballs. No pasta needed in my opinion. The mess is a must as are the cheeses and cured meats to start. The shrimp are also awesome and the warm crusty bread that comes with everything is perfect for sopping up all of the olive oil and tomato goodness. The beans and greens with sausage is a different but delicious take on a classic dish. I've had it a few times and it's been prepared differently each time. The last time I wish that there were more tomatoes in the dish but it was perfectly spicy and had fresh (and not soggy) kale throughout. The apple crostata with ice cream (of course!) is a MUST! I prefer to order a bunch of apps at E2 because you get to sample more, but that may change with the season and the menu."}
{"text":"I finally got to eat at E2 after two failed attempts (once they were closed for a private event and the second the wait was waay too long.) 

It was really nice, our waitress was very attentive. She saw our bottle of bubbly and brought over some OJ without us having to ask which was cool. The decor is classy rustic (my favorite). We got our own plates and some zeppolis to share. We got the berry ones which were delicious. Id be interested to try the traditional beignets next time. 

The bill ended up being more than I'm used to - probably because we got a bunch of OJ, a corkage fee and donuts in addition to my plate. I would likely reserve this venue for a \"special\" brunch in the future since it has a lot of valuable stuff to offer but can't break the budget by making this place a regular."}
{"text":"OMG! Seriously, brilliant name for a bunch of doughnuts. But not just any doughnuts. Delicious little bites of heaven! They rotate, so for this visit I was able to try the cinnamon sugar zeppolli and orange coconut. Both were fantastic, with the cinnamon being the best of both. 

Next up was the main meal. I don't know how I could possibly decide, as everything up on the chalkboard menu looked tantalizing. I'm always wary of ordering anything other than pancakes or french toast for brunch, because it's usually always a good thing (and my fave brunch items), but the hash just looked too good to pass up. Especially a hash with brussells and bacon. So I went for it.

And guess what? It was stellar! Probably the best non-pancake/french toast brunch I've ever enjoyed. EVER! It was mixed with onions, peppers and packed with flavor. With two massive eggs over easy and a delicious toasted piece of bread, I was trying not to lick the plate. 

Everything was so stellar that I'm looking forward to my next visit. I want everything there! Completely lived up to the hype and I want more!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for quite some time, and finally made it in for brunch last weekend. I can't even remember how this place got so hyped up in my mind - all I know is that for months it has been on the top of my list. That may be why I was a little bit disappointed despite the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed my experience there. First of all, the coffee is great. It is Fair Trade, though I'm not sure where it is from. The donut menu is neat too, although I am not much of a donut person. If I were I think I'd be in heaven though. The main brunch menu is written on a blackboard, which is hard to read, but I'm guessing it is because they switch up the menu quite often. I am all about creative chefs and frequent changes to menus so if that is the case, it makes sense. I tried a polenta dish with a red sauce (sorry - I can't remember exactly what it was) and thought it was great. I also got to try the egg sammy, which was also great.

Make sure to bring cash - Brunch is cash-only (maybe dinner is too) and there is an ATM across the street, but it was out of order when I was there."}
{"text":"We all accept that life is about trade offs.  You can smoke, but you might get emphysema.  You can hit the buffet instead of the gym, but you won't look your best for swimsuit season.  And normally, if you want fresh, authentic bistro cuisine that tastes like you're eating it in Sicily, you have to suffer a snooty, too good for you waiter and pay through the nose.

That all changed, of course, when E2 came on the Pittsburgh culinary scene!  The most delicious authentic Italian food I've had since Italy, with reasonable prices, generous portions and an EXTREMELY friendly, down to earth, enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff all housed in a cozy little cafe.  After going last night, the only question left in my mind is: When can we go back?

PS. For appetizers order and share the scrumptious $3 and $5 dollar tasting plates of artisianal meats, veggies and cheeses.  Think terrifically transcendent tapas tastings!"}
{"text":"Though no fault of E2...it must be said that if there is something to spoil a dining experience it's sitting beside a woman displaying a complete lack of self awareness, talking throughout the meal about herself so loudly that it was impossible to hear anything else except her incessant, irritating voice. Exhausting. Thankfully the interesting flavor combinations of the food saved the day. The slightly burned donuts achieved a measure of success with raspberry glaze + lime zest. And the seasonal omelette and frittata really hit the mark. The coffee was surprisingly subpar. Ultimately why E2 rises above the brunch competition is their well balanced flavors + attention to detail. It's cash only and hopefully next time...'inside voices' only!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed and had to wait 90 minutes to find out. The menu is limited and the food is decent but not worth the wait if you are looking for BYOB."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it, but they didn't open on time. The service was slow and its weird they don't have menus. You have to order off the wall which is fine, but the waitress said they were working on getting menu's. In my mind that takes 10 seconds to print menus. My scramble came with wooden twig in it about 1.5 inches long. The ingredients were fresh, but the price to value of the meal wasn't really very good."}
{"text":"Cute place, beignets were very good and sweet .I tried the farmers breakfast which was a run of the mill breakfast. The toast was amazing , the potatoes as well. The eggs were nothing exciting but the biggest miss was the bacon which was way over cooked for my liking and was breaking apart as it ate it into grease laden crumbs. I've never had bacon the was so greasy.  Everything else I saw people ordering looked much better than what I chose so I'll try something different next time."}
{"text":"We showed up for brunch over an hour before closing time. After a 5 to ten minute wait the hostess approached and asked if she could help us. When we asked for a table for two she very rudely said she is not taking any more names for the day, turned on her heel and went about her business. 

She didn't use the word \"sorry\" or pretend to be apologetic. The reverse, she bristled in a way that made me feel she wished she could grab is by the elbow, shove us out onto the sidewalk, and empty a dirty mop bucket on us for troubling her. 

I've worked in the food service industry, and have worked in a service industry for 16 years now - I really know how it is. She gets no excuses for treating people that way. 

I added one star because I liked her bangs."}
{"text":"J and I decided to try E2 for breakfast this morning after hearing great things about it. Breakfast starts at 9am and is cash only (ATM across the street). We got there around 8:45am, and were fourth in line. Best to get there early b/c after the doors opened and we were seated, the places filled w/in 5 minutes. The decor was great- lots of pix on the walls and worn wooden floors. J had coffee and the farmer's breakfast, consisting of scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and potatoes. I had the beans and greens, consisting of 2eggs (they come sunny side, but I requested scrambled and they happily and quickly obliged), kale, beans, sausage, tomatoes, parmesan cheese, red sauce, toast, and Twining's green tea (my fave!). We also started w/ beignets to share. All in all, everything was delicious! Service was great too. Everyone there is so friendly. Definitely will be returning to this little spot again soon!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. The staff was very nice, and BYOB places are always my favorite. Our service was prompt and our waitress was very helpful ! The food was amazing, I got the wild mushroom ravioli and would HIGHLY recommend it."}
{"text":"The brunch dishes were amazing, but the service was lacking. Right after we paid for our $80 brunch, the hostess asked if we could leave and go downstairs to their coffee area. I thought this was very rude since we were only there a little over an hour and paid $80! In Europe and many U.S. Restaurants, this would be frowned upon. We were also never asked if we wanted more coffee (that we poured ourselves). The server asked us once how our food was 1 minute after the meals were dropped, not even enough time to pick up my fork and take a bite. Even though the food was great, that's not the only thing that needs focus in a restaurant. Probably won't return because there are plenty of restaurants in PGH that have good food AND GOOD SERVICE. Sorry for the negative review, but I worked in the service industry for 4.5 years and I would have never asked my customers to move after they tipped me $15."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Kate Romane and E2. We like the food so much, we hired them to cater our wedding in October of 2012. They did an outstanding job. Not only did Kate make us delicious, local, seasonal food, but she was able to work with MANY food allergies that our families have. People are still talking about how much they enjoyed the food. 

E2 also has a great atmosphere in a nice business district. I highly recommend the trying some of the OMGs (Gorgonzola mess is a favorite.)"}
