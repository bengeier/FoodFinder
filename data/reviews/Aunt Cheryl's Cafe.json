{"text":"Thank you for the delicious almond cake, Aunt Cheryl!  Visiting from Virginia to see the town and this was our first stop.  Looking forward to going back and trying the famous turkey salad!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a quick bite. Warm and welcoming staff, I was looking for a cup of coffee but ended up getting myself a meatball hoagie. Good stuff, worth the price."}
{"text":"Spent a great hour talking to Aunt Cheryl. And we loved all of the desserts that we tested. Sweet potato pie is really great. Don't miss this place !"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in the Burgh! Returned to Braddock, for the All Years Braddock High School Reunion. While attending their annual Community day the next day we went up Library St and found Aunt Cheryl's Cafe. I had the most amazing food!! There signature dish turkey salad is awesome!! The sweet potato pie is to die for!! Definitely, a place to check out in the up and coming Braddock Renaissance."}
{"text":"I discovered this little place last week, hidden right in plain sight, off the main drag in Braddock -- and I tried it out today. It's on the street level of a former church, which also houses the local community center.

The food was rather tasty -- red beans and rice, y'all -- and the cake was wonderful. I didn't closely scrutinize the menu, but there seemed to be an assortment of wraps, sandwiches, rotating specials, and such. Another customer got a steak salad to go.

There's wi-fi, tasty eats, and friendly staff. Go, try ... ."}
