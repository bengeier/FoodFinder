{"text":"Food - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Atmosphere - 5/5  My wife and I are regulars at Jazzberry cafe next door, after grabbing some fresh made iced teas we decided to grab some food and were completely surprised at just how good the food here is. Family run, and the completely hand made from scratch pizza is unlike anything in the area, much less the gta. Well done! Will take pictures when we go next time. Was too busy eating!!"}
{"text":"Nice authentic Italian Cafe. The Margherita pizza was fantastic as was the house made cannoli. The Lavazza espressos were perfect. The family that runs it clearly knows their stuff. They were very warm and inviting."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Has been open for a few months and it seems like they have it together. The pastas and homemade pizza are simply delicious. They also have a hot table during the week which serves up stuffed peppers, chicken parm, eggplant parm, steamed veggies etc. The veal on a bun is my favourite on the entire menu.   This place is clean and friendly. There is wifi and of course COFFEE! Fresh ground specialty coffee and a wide selection of desserts makes this restaurant a favourite.  I would recommend trying this place at least once and make up your own mind."}
{"text":"So far my favourite dessert place in the Durham region.  My husband also agrees.  I'm a fan of their coffee, their cannolis, and cookies.  They also make hot dishes for lunch, such as pizza."}
{"text":"Highly recommend a visit here. Great specialty coffees. Friendly staff. Lots of other stuff on the menu that I am eager to try. A guy next to me was eating one of the pizzas. Looked great! I had an Americano=delicious. Great atmosphere. This place has it together."}
{"text":"Nice cafe in Pickering Village. We got a prosciutto sandwich, chicken panini, pizza and then desserts to go. Everything was delicious! The owner, very sweet and friendly. Service was excellent. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in the Pickering/Ajax area! Their coffee tastes just like coffee should. The food here is unbelievable... desserts and pastas... Whatever you chose, you can't go wrong. The owner here really knows how to treat his customers."}
{"text":"Small but a very cozy place.  The workers were super helpful, friendly and provided excellent service.  Just felt like to stay longer with my awesome iced coffee!"}
{"text":"***Review is based on takeout coffee/cannoli and whatever service that was required.***  I was in between showings and absolutely STARVING, so I decided to check out what bakery was nearby and Maraschino fit the bill!    (It wasn't ultra-close, but there weren't that many listings for bakeries in the area.)  A 12oz coffee was $1.50 - the man behind the counter made a fresh pot - but it came out of a package.  That's fine, tasted ok.  So it's not a coffee connoisseur's paradise.  Had some time, so I also grabbed a small cannolo which was $2.  That was good too and tasted fresh with an actual ricotta - or at least a mix - filling.  Just as I was finishing, the man who served me brought out a homemade pizza and pasta to a neighbouring table.  It smelt really GOOD!    It's a shame that I wasn't able to order actual food though 'cause it did smell and look great.  Next time, Ajax!"}
{"text":"Simply terrible!  I had learned that they have hot pasta entrees.  So one evening I decided to pop in and get a couple lasagna portion to take home for dinner.  It is advertised as fresh home made lasagna on their menu board - so I assumed this was a good sign.  I placed and paid for my order.  Then as I watched the kitchen through the open window ... I saw the guy open the fridge, and scoop out two pieces of the pasta from a square pan with his BARE HANDS  .... then placed the pieces on a plate and proceeded to warm them up in a microwave; he then placed the pieces in a foil container and a young lady handed me the package.  I was stunned but didn't have the guts to confront the issue, especially since I had already paid.  The pasta did not make it to the dinner plates - it ended up in the garbage instead.  I decided to give this place a 2nd try and thought that breakfast would be better .... but I was wrong! At 10am in the morning, there was no bread or breakfast food options -- when I asked what was available for breakfast the owner told me that they were still making breakfast.  How is that even possible for a place that advertises breakfast? He pointed out some dessert tarts in the glass case a compromise.  Cafe failure!"}
{"text":"A small bakery and Italian food place in Pickering Village with fantastic sandwiches and pastries made on location.  The owner always has different sides and dishes available and clearly makes them with passion.  Very good coffee as well."}
