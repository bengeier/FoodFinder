{"text":"I will only speak the truth. Tandoor Chicken is not from a Tandoor or the Naan or Tikka.. It is FRIED.  You are better off going to a restaurant that has the proper  ingrediants and equipment to cook the food in. The owner is a nice oerson though but probably just order the wine"}
{"text":"We love this place.  We've only had dinner here so can't speak to the lunch buffet.  The staff is very friendly and attentive but not overly so.  The food is awesome.  We are vegetarian and love the combo platter appetizer.  We've had the baked eggplant, channa masala, dal makhni, gobi mutter, and bahindi aloo. All excellent with fresh ingredients and perfectly spiced.  I don't agree with the negative comments here - this place is great."}
{"text":"I am biased towards Situl:  going to Situl has been a longstanding tradition with my Charlotte friends that started when I was in college, and there are a lot of fond and important memories I associate with this restaurant.  That being said, this is my go-to Indian restaurant in Charlotte.  The service is not top-notch and the prices somewhat high -- but that's been most of my experience with Charlotte Indian restaurants.  We've waited over an hour for food before.  Additionally they don't go as hot as I'd like them to -- but then, I like spicy food that hits the threshold of pain.  The amount they spice the food will appeal to most of their customers.  

The food is fantastic, though.  Some of my favorite Indian (and Indo-Chinese) food.   Currently I am living in New York and Situl is one of those places I will have to visit each time I am in NC to visit.  Just writing this makes me want to order some Chicken Manchurian!"}
{"text":"Was a little tough to find because it is in a strip mall but behind the strip with most stores. I had never tried Nepali food before and thought that it'd be interesting. Got mango lassi to start which was really good. The owner's wife took down our orders and was really nice and helpful. She suggested that we try spice level 2 (they rate their spice level for all dishes 1-5) as even that might be very spicy. I wondered if my girlfriend would find that too bland, but she thought it was perfect. As for me, even spice level 2 had my nose watering a bit.

When we ordered Momos as a starter, she warned us that it'd take time and we could probably get that for a main course. We wanted to split it anyway. So we also ordered a curry (Bodi Tamaa - bambo shoots and black eyed peas) that she recommended and got Garlic Naan with it. I also ordered a Chicken Chowmein. It was a lot of food and we had to get some of it packed. But it was great reheating that for Sunday brunch :-)

Service - 5/5. Very friendly, came around multiple times to make sure we were doing al right. And I appreciated the warning that Momos would take time. 

Food: 4.5/5 - I didn't try any of the Indian dishes. But I really liked the curry and the Naan. Also liked the Chowmein even though it was a little oily (well, Indian chinese is usually really oily) but that wasn't unexpected. I liked the flavor of the chicken pieces in it and liked the slight tanginess of both the chowmein and the curry. I didn't like the Momos as much as I'd expected but my girlfriend loved them and the tangy dip served with it. Overall, very happy with the meal and would definitely return. 

My previous fave Indian place in Charlotte had been Passage to India near Univ. But the last visit had left me disappointed - maybe the chef had changed or was on holiday. But for me, the 10 mile drive there was just not worth it after that. Glad to find another place closer that seems much better and seems like it will be far more consistent as it is family-owned and run."}
{"text":"Having only eaten Indian food one other time, years ago, I consider this my first real experience with Indian food. We went on a weekday night and there was only one other table seated, so service was good.

My lack of experience with Indian food meant I was relying on the menu for guidance. The menu seemed fairly descriptive and I was able to get a pretty good idea of what I was ordering. I was a little confused as to which items were spicy and which ones weren't. It turned out pretty much anything could be spicy (on the ol' 1-5 scale). However, since I wasn't aware of this at the time and wanted something spicy, I decided to go with the chicken vindaloo (which had the word \"HOT\" in the description). I went with a 3 on the spiciness. The dish was quite delicious and it was certainly spicy. In retrospect, I may have actually been okay with a 2 on the spiciness since this left me with sweat dripping off my brow. My chief complaint was with the portion sizes. I thought all the portions we had at our table were on the small side, especially for the price.

Though the food was at least 4 stars in my book, the price and small portion sizes of the entrees mean I can't go above a 3. However, I do look forward to going back and trying some of the other dishes soon."}
{"text":"I have yet to try the lunch buffet that everyone talks so much about, but when I come here for dinner its nice, quiet, and low lit. Its great for dates or a nice evening with close friends. The service is great and the food amazing. I'm really into spicy foods so I typically order level 5 spice and its hot but the heat doesn't mask the flavors of the dish which tends to happen at a lot of other restaurants where I order very spicy foods."}
{"text":"Good food for the money.  Attentive staff. Lunch buffet is hot or miss - better if you go earlier than later. Ordered entrees are very good, naan is great. Worth a visit. Beware that If you ask for hot, you'll get it!"}
{"text":"Situl is a weekly occurance for my husband and I. Similar to other responses, we just love Indian food. This place is different though. The Nepalese twist is unique.

We order Chana Saag (chickpeas and spinach) most visits with Garlic Naan. That dish is incredible! I will say that out of every Indian restaurant we have tried, the naan at Situl is the smallest portion size but is the crispiest/freshest tasting. And what makes things even better is the red onion chutney that is served with the meal. Just enough spice so that you can add it to your curry/meal and control the heat. I turn down going to other Indian restaurants in the area for Situl sometimes just because of the red onion chutney. 

The iced chai tea is delicious as well.

Decor in the restaurant is minimal and dated. But the food and the people are true Charlotte gems! 

And finally, in regards to the comment that Situl is located in a shady neighborhood...the restaurant is located behind the Park Road shopping center, a lively area in actually a rather nice part of town. The fact that the restaurant is located behind the shopping center should not cause anyone to classify the location as \"shady.\" I wish for the restaurant's sake though that one day they can open a restaurant in a more populated area. Great food is going unknown by having them tucked away like they are."}
{"text":"Food is AWFUL. If your looking for Indian food, do not go to SITUL. I am originally from India and I can tell how bad the food was. Besides the food, our bill came to $28 (including $4 waiter tip), after few days I noticed charge on my bank account that they charged me for $32. The bad part is I could not even file a case against them since I did not preserve the receipt. BE AWARE OF THESE PEOPLE OUT THERE."}
{"text":"Really miserable Indian fare and that single $ is not accurate. I paid $12 for some of the worst and saltiest chicken tika masala I've ever had. In fact, everything i ate there was over salted except for the nann , which had a decidedly un-nann bread taste to it. More like pizza dough. There were none of the cool sweet sauces that usually work well with Indian dishes, just more salt. (And I usually like salt).

Also, I had sweet tea there and it had that sat-in-the-brewer too long taste to it.

My wife was equally disappointed, and especially as we were having a mini-celebration of her running her first 10k. The place was decidedly UN festive compared to a lot of Indian restaurants we've been to here in the states and in the UK.

For what we ended up paying we could've gone to Copper. :\"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Situl.  We usually go to Maharani but we thought we'd venture out.  My first inkling that things to come were not going to be wonderful were the poppadoms .  They were greasy.  & I don't just mean slightly oily, I mean there were pools of oil on them.  I didn't know poppadoms could be greasy!  The food lacked undertones which are one of the enjoyments of Indian food.  It was spicy but that was it.  There was no real flavour behind it.  It was oily & one dimensional.  We were the only people in there at 7pm on a Saturday night which also usually says something about a a restaurant.  Go to Maharani instead."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant. I am a lover of Indian food and come here often for dinner.  I've never been disappointed. The food is delicious and the staff is incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The people working there seemed quite cordial.  It is convenient to both work and home.  But I just couldn't get there.  The ambiance is nil, and the food is average.  Let's just call it an adequate feeding trough at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was not good at all. On the plus side, it's actually not the worst Indian food I've had in this area (that award goes to Jaipur), and the service was nice and friendly. But the food was not good."}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot for Indian in Charlotte. The management and wait staff have always been very friendly and helpful, and after several years of regular visits we still haven't tried everything on the huge menu. Best samosas in town!"}
{"text":"Tried it last night for the first time and we usually love Indian food. Ordered a take out and even though we gave them the 25 minutes they asked for to prepare the food before we showed up, it took them another 25 minutes to get the food to us after we got there. 

We got there during peak rush hour on Saturday night, but there were only two tables occupied in the entire restaurant. We only saw one employee there the whole time we were there. She was waiting on the tables, cashier, hostess, busing the table, etc. She kept disappearing in the back for long periods of time, so, who knows? She may have been cooking the food too. 

The food was pretty bad. I ordered the eggplant dish, Baingan Bhartha, and kept finding hard, sharp burnt pieces of...something...in it. It was loaded with oil and, altogether, pretty inedible. The lentil soup was so salty that neither my daughter or I could finish it. The nan bread was soggy and chewy. 

We really wanted to like this place, but will probably not go back."}
{"text":"OK so the service is a bit slow in this family owned and run restaurant. But the food is worth it. My first time here so I had the Tandoori Chicken. I was warned it would take some time to prepare, but it was worth the wait. Served crackling, spitting hot out of their clay oven it was delicious. My companion had the Nepalese version with a different sauce, also great. Home made nan hot from the ovens. Quite a tasty experience. The portions were just right, too. I was there on a Saturday night and the place was only half full. This is a small family operation that is barely hanging on. Most everything is made fresh to order and takes a bit of time. Too bad that so many of us are in such a hurry to eat and run. I will be sorry to see them forced to close their doors."}
{"text":"I was really excited about coming here. I see the ad in Creative Loafing for the $7.95 all you can eat buffet, which sounds like such an awesome deal!! Except...not when you don't really want to eat anything. The restaurant is dark and rickety and does not feel welcoming.
The buffet was limited and nothing really had much of a taste. 
The first line has a few sauces and a salad with iceberg lettuce, peppers and carrots. The second line had soups and the third had four vegetarian and four chicken options. The rice pudding on the dessert bar was super runny and bland. The cantaloupe tasted a bit old as well. 

I love all things Indian but Situl does not measure up. They give you a basket of naan upon sitting down. It too was bland and even tasted a bit stale. We usually eat up the naan and ask for more to dip into all the wonderful sauces, but it was left untouched. I was looking forward to an Indian buffet so close to me, but paying a little extra and going to Bombay or Blue Taj is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Situl Indian Restaurant, located in the shadiest of shades, offered both an experience and Nepalese menu I can't find anywhere else. Reading the menu is like being dropped into the middle of the Apple Store: a lot is going on, you don't understand half of it, and it all sounds pretty good. I was in the state of \"I'm-hungry-enough-so-it-doesn't-matter,\" stage, which often means decisions are even harder to make.

I got aloo gobi, a cauliflower/potato/pepper curry dressed in a dark brown sauce with some garlic. It was a thick concoction that chapati, a pancake-like flatbread went well with. The sweet brown sauce it came with was thin, syrupy, and reminded me of apple butter. The chapati was a good complement because of how much the sweet was able to neutralize the salty spice. I thought the food here had a little too much salt.

One patron reviewer on Yelp described the atmosphere as nil, and my friend commented the decor is a little-left-of-horrid on the way in. With a \"packed\" crowd you'd expect on Thursday night, there was less people watching and more looking up and down at the various bits of textile and fake flowers. Even though it wasn't a busy night (minimal bicycle rings notifying that food was ready), the service was a bit slow, making the setting not humble, but pretty bleak.

Friendly staff, but I might try a place with a busier atmosphere and tighter grip on the salt. For what it cost and for the dish size, I'd rather go elsewhere for the flavors."}
{"text":"The best part of this place is how close it is to my house, so my review is a bit biased, but I was very pleased with the Lamb Biryani that I ordered for carry out. The Naan was also delicious and the meal had a nice kick to it! 3 out of 5 on the spicy rating was pretty hot so if you like things mild go with a 1 out of 5 on the spicy scale to be safe."}
{"text":"If you're the gambling type, you'll definitely be chancing it if you try this place. You can see by the mixed reviews some like it, others do not.

I'm in the \"not a fan\" category. Husband and I stopped in for their lunch buffet and left with gurgles in our bellies. Perhaps it was the sad looking dishes that looked as though they were sitting out for hours. I seldom eat buffets, but I was convinced one hungry afternoon. When I think buffet, I think it should be fresh and plentiful. Not here.

Service was friendly, but not enough to convince me to return."}
{"text":"This review is based only on food and service.  The restaurant is clean, I have no issues with the decor, but others may. So I'm saying up front, I don't care what it looks like, you just gotta get in there and get some food! 

I have been here more times than I can count, the food is AMAZING. The staff is so nice, as well, but go for the best Indian food in town. 

The naan is perfect, the samosas are delicious, and the lamb saag makes my mouth water just talking about it.  I also really enjoy the fried Cauliflower here. I've sampled several menu items and never once been disappointed. 

I've tried a couple other places around town, but nothing gets close to Situl. A true hidden gem in Charlotte, totally worth finding!"}
{"text":"I'll also preface and say that I do not care about the decor-give me good food and I'll eat in a dirty ally. Their dinner is good although it is a bit expensive. I do not recommend the buffet though-the first time I've been at a loss to eat Indian food. Staff is very friendly and always attentive."}
{"text":"Based on this past Saturday Nights experience this was an easy review to write!  For Dessert (eaten first) Kulfi 3.98 yelp stars, great flavor, was \"scooped\" (never had it scooped before) it seemed a little too icy, too light, could have been creamier, though still way better than most.  Next they brought out the usual complimentary \"spicy\" Onion Chutney and cracker.  This is a smart move because they ask you to gauge the level of spiciness for your meal based on how \"spicy hot\" you think the Chutney is.  They say the Onion Chutney is a two spice level and to me it is about perfect hot (or a bit hotter than I would prefer to eat on a regular basis).  So I order everything at spice level two.  My yelp rating for the Onion Chutney is 5 yelp stars!  

I love Masala Chai, when it is real good I can taste, Cloves, Cinnamon, Ginger, Cardamom and it is sweet and creamy (when it's good).  Most Indian Restaurants have very poor Malsala Chai, if they have it at all!  Saturday night Situl had good Masala Chai - I'm giving it 4.1 yelp stars.  

Situl represents three cultures and has a menu for each:  Indian, Nepali and Indo-Chinese.  My soup came from the Nepali section and is called Everest Chicken Soup.  This easily makes my \"Soup's On\" list.  This was very enjoyable, the vegetables were so fresh and many had a slight \"crunch\" left in them, perfectly seasoned, 4.89 stars!  The Garlic Naan was in one large piece with lots of garlic and butter!  This was the most unique Garlic Naan I have ever tasted and was very good, 4.25 stars.

Now for the Entree and I'll say the service was perfect and \"Boldness\" counts!  My waiter recommended the Soup and the Entree.  I was going to order Chicken Tikka Masala and he suggested (without me asking for a recommendation) Bombay Chicken.  I got Bombay Chicken and it was tasty, milder than the rest of the meal, still flavorful,  Chunks of boneless white meat Chicken, with Raisins and Tomatoes in a Creamy Garlic, Ginger Sauce, 3.35 stars!

 Oooops I left my wallet at home!  They asked if they could hold my camera, I said sure and as you can see (if you look) I got my camera back!  The Decor here has a sparseness to it... Still this place does have a certain Charm to me, though I wonder if the appeal is that it is located in the \"Back Court\" of a Charming old Shopping Center?"}
{"text":"I like this place.  The people are friendly and the food is good.  It is definetly quiet.  I must say though, I enjoy a good quiet setting from time to time.  It is a wonder how they stay in business though.  It's always sparce on the patrons."}
{"text":"Situl is great - it's the best Indian food I've had in a long time. It also has Nepalese fare. The decor may not be trendy, but the food is delicious. It's also not any more expensive than your typical Indian restaurant. Dinner entrees range from $10-$15, depending on what you get. It's just behind Park Road Shopping Center, kind of behind the Michael's - you enter the same parking lot and then just drive behind. Service is great and friendly."}
{"text":"I will never go here again. The management is absolutely horrible. I frequently eat Indian food at various restaurants. I had never been here before so I used Alu Gobi as my \"measuring stick\". The food arrived and the dish was all wrong. I asked the waitress if why it was so different. She sent the manager out and he told me that Indian food is not Chinese food. He said \"We don't have your brown sauce.\"

Never going back after that."}
{"text":"I love this, off the beaten path delight. Lunch is good but the dinner meals are excellent."}
{"text":"In town on a business trip and wanted something vegetarian not too far from hotel.  It is generally easier to eat vegetarian looking at Thai or Indian food and this place came up.  Not great reviews but surprisingly few options for a large city.
Called ahead for the Channa Masala and garlic naan.  Guy was a little hard to understand but very friendly.
The lady helping me was also very friendly and, when I told her I needed a plastic spoon because I was staying in hotel, she hurried back and got me utensils, plate and extra napkins.
The Channa was very spicy (like I requested) and tasty.  A little too much oil but overall good.  Naan was very good (with fresh Cilantro) but it was only one smallish piece.
3.5 stars for food, 4.5 for service."}
{"text":"Tried it twice; I've given up after the second time. Chicken texture in the chicken tikka masala was weird - it seemed like they use cheap, low-quality cuts of meat. Food was spicy without being actually flavorful. Even the naan was strange - unusually thin, like they were being stingy on the amount of dough being used. Takeout service was slow - it took almost twice as long as they said it would take. Overall, a low quality experience. I'm willing to drive farther to go to a better restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, there aren't too many places in Charlotte that offer Nepalese food - so if that is your craving, you may have to bite the bullet and head to Situl. The good news is that the food is actually quite good. If I rated on the food alone, it would be awesome. If I rated on the service alone, not so much.

I went with a group of people and spent a painful three hours in the restaurant. The best parts of the meal were the actual food - which unfortunately didn't last long - and the company (as it should be).

In some places, the length of a meal is to be expected (see The Melting Pot). Each table takes very close to the same amount of time. You receive a regularly paced service. Not at Situl.

You sit, are given menus, and then you sit some more. You watch tables come in, get menus, order, eat their food, get their checks, leave, and then you may get your food.

By food, I mean a paltry dish called a \"platter\" which is really a bread plate with a single piece of each appetizer. This is a platter? I get that we as a country are in a dangerous area of consumption, and there are places that we should cut back. But when you order a platter to sample multiple appetizers - to share no less - this is what you get? Yikes. That it costs what it does makes matters worse.

Then another round of tables comes in, gets their food and leaves and then we get our entree. The saving grace, because this food is amazingly tasty. I don't even know what I ordered. The service - when it comes - is quite good. Glasses are kept full, and the suggestion for Nepalese is some off-menu item which is one of the best dishes I've had in a good while. The Naan is a fresh and tasty side to go along with it.

Afterwards, the dishes are cleared and another round of tables come in to eat. Eventually we ask to get our checks and they come out. Which is to say that a single piece of paper shows what each person owes. No breakdown, just a number scrawled on a pad in the position where everyone is sitting. But it's way higher than it should be.

Of course it includes tax, but it turns out it includes a 20% tip - which strangely it never mentions anywhere (though it isn't uncommon for larger groups) and another $2 or so, because the waiter can't make it equal the same amount when questioned about it. Nice.

Definitely on the long side here, so the result? Go for the food, and go if you're in a small party, but not in a group. Or perhaps even order ahead and take it home with you. But don't sit and wait for it."}
{"text":"I love Indian food, so it was hard for me not to like this.

Ordered a hot tea (they even brought milk with it) and ordered the vegetarian Thali platter, a complete meal which came with bread, saag paneer, chana masala, yogurt sauce, lentils, and rice (as well as some sort of cake ball soaked in a syrupy sauce). Food was excellent. Minor complaint - the rice was not on a small plate but instead on the stainless steel platter. It was difficult to scoop with spoon on my plate to use as a base for the other sides and on fortunately dropped some of it it on the table. Will have to ask for that in a small dish next time.

Otherwise, excellent service and great food. Tried to order from the Nepali menu, but the momo I tried to order would have taken an hour to prepare (indicated on the menu \"Special Order\"). Would love to come back."}
{"text":"Situl is our favorite Indian Restraunts. It is truly a hidden gem. The staff is so kind, and like foreign restraunts, they don't rush you out the door. Instead they allow you to enjoy the experience. The food is awesome! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge lover of Indian and Situl does not disappoint. I've had several dishes, but the Channa Massala and their Paneer Tikka Massala are the best. Their onion chutney goes great with the Naan and the owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"I really wish there was a 3.5 star option right now.  Situl's buffet is awful - stay away.  But some of the items on their dinner menu are pretty good, although a little over-priced for the quantity.

The lamb vindaloo is my favorite indian dish of theirs, but if you feel like mixing it up- def give their \"indo-chinese\" options a shot.  The chicken manchurian is awesome.  Be careful with their spice levels - I can eat really spicy food but don't go higher than a 4 out of 5 here (and it's still REALLY spicy)

I'd hit this place up for some to-go on the regular if it was just a little cheaper."}
{"text":"Overall, I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. I wouldn't say it was the best, or that the decor or anything was amazing, but it was good Indian food. 

We started with the sampler platter for an appetizer. There were a lot of different tastes on the plate, but there was only one of each variety. It was a good thing the three of us were good friends, because that made sharing a little awkward. Everything was tasty though! 

When we each got our meals, mine had plenty of chicken and was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend ordered something with lamb and, sadly, there were only 3-4 small chunks of lamb and the rest was a stew/sauce. Needless to say, it wasn't enough for him and he ended up snacking later in the night. 

The location is behind the Michaels in a  weird, small strip mall that looks forgotten about. The decor inside was lacking and the service, well, you definitely weren't rushed. It's not a bad place, but also not an over the top amazing place."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here but it takes way too long to prepare the meals. Super shady location but still worth it to go if you have some time to sit for a while for dinner. It's always nice and quiet place."}
{"text":"First time at situl. Amazing food. Not very restaurant style oily food. Great taste...homely taste. And a whole lot of options. Tried the Bombay chicken...yumm"}
{"text":"Being a lover of Indian food, I was excited that my group chose Situl. I had never eaten there before and was looking forward to it.  The restaurant  had few customers when I arrived.  Appetizer platters had already been ordered.  The term \"platters\" was quite an exaggeration.  I would have used the term \"salad plates.\"  But, the appetizers, served with a green sauce and a relish listed as 2 on the heat scale, were delicious!  I ordered Vegetable Karma, described as grated vegetables and cheese in a cream sauce.  I specified number 4 on the heat scale, which went to 5.  It came with rice, and I also ordered garlic naan.  The heat was nice, but the meal did not stand out visually or flavor wise.  But, I did adore the little copper pot used for presentation.
Now, one would think if a restaurant was expecting a group of 10 or 12 that there would be adequate staff that night.  One server for the entire place.  Not sure how many chefs were in the kitchen, but it took a long time, an hour or greater, to be served.  Other tables seated later received their food, ate and left before we did.  It was as if we were guests in the home of someone who didn't plan ahead.  It took a long time to receive our checks as well.  I like to support small businesses, but probably will not return."}
{"text":"Puke.
Chicken Korma tasted like rubber ducky puka.  It was gravy, not a cream or cashew based sauce as it should be.  It was thick and disgusting.  I asked for all white meat and the waitress acted like that was a problem but agreed to it.  However, the chicken was undercooked and tasted old. 

The chicken tikka masala tasted like tomato sauce that had gone bad.  

The rice was dry

The naan was burnt.  

The place looked like the Bates Motel--super grimy

The service was slow

The water tasted like fish

No one was there on a Friday night which made it even more creepy.

Yuck.  Would not return.  Too pricy for the poor quality and service."}
{"text":"This place sucks balls!!! Lunch buffet was like eating cardboard, sweet tea tasted like it had been poured out of a old dingy boot, the dudes shirt that waited on us looked as if he just crawled out from under a car changing oil!!! 

We were the only 3 in there the whole time, my coworker thinks it could be a front for a terrorist operation!!

Anyways, don't waste your time or money!!!"}
{"text":"Stopping in for their lunch buffet ($8.75 with tax), I was a little wary by the emptiness of the place. Other than me, there was only one other couple there, and this was during the peak lunch \"rush.\"

The buffet was laid out with 8 trays on the steam table, 4 vegetarian dishes and 4 chicken dishes, plus one tray of rice and one of \"asian noodles\". The salad bar had a selection of various spices, including riata. There was also a dessert bar with rice balls and sliced melon.

I placed a portion of rice on my plate as well as a spoon of the chicken curry and chicken chilli, plus something a palak paneer (spinach curry) and later went back for more rice, a piece of chicken tandoori, some chole (garbanzo bean curry) and chicken masala. All were pretty mild on the spice scale, but they had plenty of delicious flavor.

The waiter brough by a basket of fresh naan bread, which was super useful for soaking up the sauce from my plate. He also was great at refilling my water glass and bringing the check.

Would I return? Yes, I think so. It's located in the \"back court\", so drive around behind Michael's Arts & Crafts store and its at the end."}
{"text":"The best way to check how authentic a place is what it claims to be is to order the specialty.
I read it was run by a couple from Nepal and Punjab - so I ordered Nepali and Indo-Chinese - Chowmein vegetable and Chilli Paneer - takeaway.

As soon as I opened the boxes, I knew the food had authentic flavor and fragrance.
The taste was good too. I had ordered \"mild\" because of what I read in previous review but I think I'll want to step up to \"medium\" next time.
The quantity was good too.

My only complaint was the food was too oily. Maybe I'll mention that when I order next time because I'm definitely going back for the authentic Indo-Chinese/Nepali food!!"}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time and it was great!  We stumbled across it accidentally and thought to give it a try.  The samosas were fantastic and we got a mix dinner entree.  Awesome naan too.  The service was really nice so we will be back.  Good find"}
{"text":"After a horrible service experience with a large group here, a few of us from that group decided to give the place another chance as a group of 4.  

The service this time around was quite different.  But actually we were the only diners in the place this time around so it would have been difficult to equal the poor service of the previous visit.

Since many people raved about the Nepalese options last time around, that is what I went with this time.  A chicken dish in a spicy sauce, level 4 on the spice meter. I also opted for the fried cauliflower appetizer.

The appetizer was good.  I was able to sample two other appetizers in an onion patty and samoa that my table mates ordered.  Their dipping sauces are wonderful, especially the spicy pickled pepper one.

The meal, Mashu Bansha, was so flavorful.  The chicken was tender and almost melted in your mouth.  The sauce was was delicious and spicy although I think I could have handled going one level up on spice.

I may have been a little harsh in my earlier one-star review.  The service was awful then but the food is consistently amazing here.  Service was decent this time around but the place could really improve with a POS system because if you have separate checks, they total everything up and read it to you rather than provide you with an itemized list.

That was my only complaint this time around.  But stil I would avoid coming here with a large group."}
