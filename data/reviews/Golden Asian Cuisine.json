{"text":"Ordered the food a couple of times and have to say I very perplexed of the the taste of the chicken in their dishes so much so I am not sure it is chicken so I will not order again!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Food for a reasonable Price.
Sweet & Sour Chicken and hot garlic Chicken was very delicious!
Friendly service"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place the restaurant is nice and the setup is detailed yet simple the cutover service is nice I recommend the chicken corn soup or rice"}
{"text":"Every meal is coated with a rubber sauce of fat.
Part 2. My staff got me a take out combo and didnt tell me it was from here. I enjoyed it. So for now we give this place a second chance.UPDATE. Pleased with there new lineup of food."}
{"text":"i have been eating at this restaurant almost 5 years now and i guess thats since they started their business , there was a another restaurant here before them it was called i guess Wok or something which didn't last long, i think i pretty much ate every single day at this place and always found it delicious its a Oily food but very tasty owner Michael and his wife are very sweet people they always give me lunch special all day long anytime i go they never refuse me even though their lunch special ends at 3pm but i get it anytime of the day i am really thankful to them , my all time favourite are chicken Manchurian, Chilli chicken , and i tried other dishes too and pretty much every dish has its own taste , Mr toronto G mentioned that sauce is like rubber i would suggest him that he can eat without sauce also try vegetable dishes as they have different kind of sauce , i think i never felt sick after eating at this place its been always good and i can tell that this is the only restaurant in my life time where i ate countless time i thing every Day for few years and then every few days , now a days i moved to east side of city as they are located at west end and i miss  their food and them as well but everytime i pass by Etobicoke and if im hungry i always stop by this place i love it , and i wish them good luck and more success they are very good people ...... :)       
\"Friend :P\" thats what they call me hope if they read it they would know that its their Friend ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's very nondescript exterior doesn't indicate the yummy dishes served inside. The staff are very nice and approachable. Their menu is extensive and all the dishes I've tried are amazing. 

My fave is the Manchurian chicken with gravy. I also love their beef with bitter melon, it's an accelerated acquired taste, if you are a fan of this dish you need to try it

Prices are also very reasonable, dishes are large portion. 

If you are in the hood (Rexdale, Kipling and Rexdale Blvd) you need to check it out"}
{"text":"Come for lunch best $7.99 ever spent.  I recommend crispy ginger chicken,  Manchurian chicken,   and general too.  Mountain of food with spring roll and drink.  We go every few weeks."}
{"text":"Restaurant claims to deliver but only has pick up. Pictures look appetizing unfortunately, I won't be able to try this."}
{"text":"We've dined here sooooo many times that we've lost count.  Pretty decent for Chinese food.  Standard offerings of a variety of rice, noodles, beef, chicken, pork and fish dishes.  Very generous portions!  Even when we pack it home, it's as though it's a brand new take-out container!  Very friendly service.  Only complaint is that the dishes are quite oily as of course, most of it is either fried or drowning in sauce.  Good deal if you're into Chinese food but in moderation if you're watching your waistline!"}
{"text":"My favourite place to come to for Hakka food. It's a small little restaurant on the end of a plaza strip and not very noticeable from the street, but it's always packed and for good reason - the food is consistently great and the service is quick.

I've tried several different dishes here and each one has been good in its own way, but my favourite is the Bombay Chicken - it's spicy, full of flavor, crunchy on the outside, and juicy on the inside. It doesn't come with a curry or sauce, but it's so flavorful that it still goes well with just plain white rice. Also the portion sizes are large so you won't be leaving hungry.

I'll usually come here for lunch - the special is under $10 and your dish comes with a spring roll (really good) and a drink. Definitely can't beat that value!"}
{"text":"Friend recommended this place, and I will never go back.  The Pad Thai tasted awful (threw it out), the rice was soggy, and everything was just poor.  The egg rolls were only half filled and nothing had any texture, like they were steamed far too long.  Most things tasted like they were re-heated from frozen.  The food was just terrible, but the service was prompt and polite, so they get one star.  In an area surrounded by fast food competitors, you would think they would put more care and effort into the food they prepare.

I guess they stay alive being on two busy bus lines, because there are at least four great Chinese food places (both authentic and Canadianized) within a 10 minute drive.

Save your money, or go the extra 5-10 minutes (by car) to the other Chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I was staying in this area and looking for a quick spot. Actually, originally I was looking for somewhere that had delivery. My phone experience with Golden Asian Cuisine was pretty disappointing. First, they told me they couldn't deliver because it was too far without even looking into my address. After 5 minutes on the phone they realized I was close enough to deliver, but then told me it would take over an hour to deliver. I decided that was fine, and I'd be willing to wait. Then I ordered and was told there was a $30 minimum for delivery. So I spent 15 minutes on the phone with them and didn't end up getting anything delivered. 

Now what do I do? I actually GO to the restaurant to just eat there because I didn't want $30 worth of Chinese food for myself. What do I find? The restaurant has like 8 people in it...not sure why delivery would take an hour! The woman who worked there was really nice and even though they messed up my order, she was accommodating and replaced it with the correct dish. However, the food was pretty bland and flavorless. On the plus side, portions are HUGE. I'm talking get 1 order of noodles and it's enough for 3 people. 

Didn't have a great experience, but left very full and with a lot of leftovers."}
{"text":"Food is average. Would use because convenient. Cleanliness is average. Service is fast"}
{"text":"I haven't had good fried rice like this in years! I love that Smokey fried rice taste it brings out the ingredients so much better. We had some amazing shrimp wonton soup, but the wontons were a little smaller than the place I go to back home that makes them out of shrimp too. The Cantonese chowmein is fantastic. Lots of drink refills too with tea and water for our group. Server was attentive too. Will be back"}
{"text":"I found this place when I worked in the area and I quickly became the reason I 'forgot' my lunch at home. If I could have afforded it I would have eaten here all the time. Everything that I have tried is delicious. I highly suggest the Bombay Chicken, Manchurian Beef, Crispy Ginger Beef and Sweet and Sour Pork. The portion are large so you'll always be full and have leftovers for a small snack. Their lunch special includes a spring roll and a drink, all for less than $9.00, taxes in."}
{"text":"An amazing restaurant if you want anything Hakka, Thai or Indian (or if your group can't decide between the three). Absolutely delicious dishes with great portions. The service was excellent also. They stay consistently very busy with take out orders and incoming patrons, but the staff works hard to stay on top of everything. There was a very rude table beside us but they kept calm (even though they were short staffed) and did everything systematically. 

We had the Chicken Pakora (10 peices - 10.75), Large Seafood Hot and Sour Soup (9.95), Dry Chili Fish (10.50), Manchurian House Special Hakka Noodle with chicken and shrimp (9.50), and the Stir Fried Green Beans in Spicy Garlic Sauce (7.95). Each dish was delightfully seasoned with their own individual spice level. The pakora was fried perfectly: crunchy exterior, moist juicy interior and spicy/tangy with the yogurt dip. The hot and sour soup was well balanced between the sour and savory, with the spice level at a medium. The dry chili fish was again very crispy and the dried chili/onion mixture was really got. Eat around that and the the fish it is at a mild level. The green beans were crunchy and sweet. Definitely the hottest dish was the hakka noodles, so spicy that it made my mouth numb!"}
{"text":"What else is there to say? Best place for Chinese hakka food! That's pretty much there is to it!"}
{"text":"**DISCLAIMER** did not eat there (TODAY).  Have been a customer for a long time - but we have noticed that they don't appear to be open on time and its a real drag!!!!!!!

Word of advice:  call before you go to ensure that they are open!"}
{"text":"Au! Au! This place really is... GOLDEN. Good vibes, good food, and good prices are a winning formula for me. 

Theme of this place is going to be flavourful portions. Every dish we got was more than filling despite the affordable prices. I can't speak on the other dishes we got, but my mango chicken was FANTASTIC. A piping hot dish of delicious chicken, covered in sauce with mango slices thrown in. It was seemingly endless and I never got tired of the taste. 

Highly recommend this place; all the customers seemed like locals and are super friendly with the staff so it definitely adds to the restaurant. I'll be coming here whenever I need to grab something quick to eat."}
{"text":"Was in Toronto area over night for a quick get-away. Price was right, portions were big. I got the Chicken Shanghai noodle and my husband got the orange beef. While he wishes there was more meat, my dish was fine. My dinner was actually massive. I had enough to take home. Ingredients were fresh, restaurant was clean. Would return for a quick bite next time we are up this way!"}
{"text":"First time getting delivery from this place and the reason for the 4 stars and not a 5 is because they got Most of my delivery WRONG! But it was Deliciously Wrong that I cannot complaaaaiiN! Okay so this is what I got on my wrong order and what I ordered.. I took a pause to write this review because the lady came knocking on my door with the Right order! But I only decided to take the Vegetable Spring Rolls and Chicken Balls.. Since I ended up eating my Wrong Order! Now here is the wrong order items that I got! Thai Mango Prawns, General Toas Chicken (which was part of my order as well), Chicken Fried Rice, Lemon Chicken and shrimp Hakka Noodles! The Shrimp Hakka Noodles were okay, I wouldn't personally oder it again 2 out of 5. The General Toas chicken was decent but I wouldn't care to order it again 3 out of 5. The Lemon Chicken was Delicious and fresh and the Lemon Sauce it came with was amazing! But it barely came with that much sauce! Stingy on the sauce, eh? Well its That Good, so why wouldn't it be? Next time I will tell them Extra Lemon Sauce just so they can make that extra buck ;) lol, they are good though. The chicken fried rice I would definitely order again, it was decent! Now.. the STAR of the order iiiiiiisssssss!!!! THAI MANGO PRAWNS! IT was sooooo Damn Delicious, I would order it again and again and again. I could eat it ALONE! MY Goodness! I can see why this place is raved about.. but just stay away from the basic dishs and go for the more so Exotic dishs and you will be happy! The spring rolls are delicious too and I will definitely order from here again, despite the wrong order! Customer Service was great, no attitude no nothing when I told them I want my chicken balls and spring rolls now Please! I got'em.. Just like that! I recommend. The End. Smiley Face."}
