{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place and I am so glad we did. We had a simple pepperoni pizza and a salad. It was so good. The dough was perfect and there was so much flavor. From the outside this place does look small but it is so nice and cozy once you get inside. The best part however is the staff. They are so nice and friendly. They made the experience that much better. I cannot wait to go back try all their pizzas!"}
{"text":"I ordered two large pizzas and hot wings online. My boyfriend and I headed to the restaurant 20 min. later. When we got there, we told the hostess we had an order to pickup. With a blank stare, she asked us what we ordered. It was the two large pizzas and hot wings, just like it said on the order that was posted on the wall right next to her. She said it would take about 10 min. for it to be ready. We sat and waited... for an hour!   During that time, several people were waiting for their orders. One guy left and came back to complain to the two hostesses that they gave him a pizza with ham. He even picked the toppings off the pizza to show them. The staff denied this, explaining that they don't even have ham or Canadian bacon. We ordered Canadian bacon pizza, and they never mentioned that there was a problem with this. There was also a couple that dined in, and they asked for their pizza to go, because it took too long. The hostess asked us again what we had ordered, and I said again: two large pizzas and hot wings. A few minutes later, the hostess gives us a Greek salad, a large pizza, and wings. We didn't order salad. Right after that, she attempts to give us the pizza that the other guy brought in. It had been sitting out for a while, and it was touched by other people. \"Are you seriously going to give us that pizza?\" my boyfriend asks. Besides, it wasn't even the size we ordered. We had to repeat our order, and we finally got the food that was only supposed to take 20 min. to make. Even when we went to the cashier to pay, the hostess had to ask us one more time what we ordered, even though we were holding the food in our hands, the order was up on the wall next to her, and we were one of only 3 orders they were dealing with.   I would really like to give the benefit of the doubt to this place, but it's impossible. They weren't particularly busy. They had one or two groups actually dining in. I saw at least 3 guys in the kitchen, so I'm not sure why everything took so long. The hostesses acted like they were brand new, but if that was the case, there should have been someone with seniority working that night and training these people to do their jobs. In return for all the hassle, we just got an apology for the wait. Not good enough, guys. I really wanted to give this place a chance, since I live so close by. But,  I don't think this place is worth another chance, ever."}
{"text":"Had a groupon so checked this place out - little hole in the wall but pizza was good - was it the best I have ever had - no, but it was good.  Salads were just OK."}
{"text":"Had the margarita pizza which was under cooked. The biggest disappointment however was the wings. We ordered the \"what the hell hot\" wings and received wings with no heat. Should be called \"where the hells the sauce\" wings. Not even sauce at the bottom of the container. Terrible wings and under cooked pizza. hope it was a mistake but I will never know cause we won't be back."}
{"text":"Decided to give this a try as i had a groupon and am on a quest to find a delicious pizza in the valley.  When we arrived there was only one other table and they soon left so it was only us.  Service was good.  We started with cheese filled breadsticks. They were good.  We had the margherita pizza - very good. No complaints.  However, they blew any chance of us ever returning when they told us that they were adding an 18% gratuity (which i would've paid anyways) and a $2 service fee.  They said it was mentioned in the fine print on the groupon.  It wasn't.  When my bill came back, the service fee was $3.    Were they so desperate for the extra buck because we were the only customers?    Oh yeah, we also had to wait 20 minutes for the check to be picked up as the three employees were busy watching food network.  Really."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, friend, and I went here to use a Groupon I had...and because it was close to a SF Giants Spring Training game.  At first glance, the place looked small.  But, after we parked in the back and entered the location, it wasn't at all to what it seemed.  The service and food was excellent!  We ordered the calamari and a pie.  Delish!  Wished I lived closer..."}
{"text":"We were thinking as we pulled in that the place from the outside didn't look like much. BTW parking in the the rear of the building. We got there just as they opened 2:00 p.m. midweek. The server offered us a free bread with a wonderful salsa like mixture of tomatoes, onions, and olive oil to name a few. We ordered a big pizza for what I thought was a good price.  Yum it was delicious tasting. We also ordered cheese sticks that came to the table attractive displayed in a plate of sauce.  I think the food was high end in both looks and taste. The pizza crust was wonderful and we had no problem with the children gobbling it  up.. The place is small has so romantic appeal and the staff was very pleasant. Definitive on the list for a return trip."}
{"text":"This place rocks. We had a jumbo pizza with pepperoni, sausage, pinneaple and it was AMAZING. Thin crust pizza at its best. There are only a few places in the entire valley that meet or beat this pizza. They had a secret dessert that was sort of like indian fry bread with powdered sugar and chocolate syrup all over it. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Went in there on a Saturday night and I had a $35 Groupon to spend.  It wasn't very busy, and the owner was in there and she was very nice and friendly.  There was a TV right above my head and it was BLARING some kind of soccer game in Spanish.   I asked her to turn it down a little or at least put it on something that the customers in her restaurant could understand.  I guess the cooks in the back were watching it while they were working, and if she changed it, they would be mad about it (her words, not mine)  and that was more important than the wants or needs of the paying customers.  That immediately left a bad taste in my mouth.  We had lasagna that had a funny taste to it, 2.5 stars max.  Then when we went to pay, she charged me $2.50 to use my groupon.  I asked her why and she pointed to a little tiny plaque on the wall that I didn't even bother reading.   I use Groupons all the time, and this is the first time a restaurant has charged me to use one.    Note to the owner:  Customer Service is probably  more important than the wants or needs of your cooks, and probably just as important as the taste of your food.  You should put more focus on it."}
{"text":"My husband and I came across this place on Homerun.com. After reading the reviews on yelp, we were really excited to use our voucher here. We were NOT disappointed! The restaurant is a small hole in the wall but the decor inside is warm and comfortable. Donili has an awesome menu filled with great pizza combos and pastas and salads. The baked pasta was pretty decent, the caesar salad was delish, the pizza was TO DIE FOR!! :) Once you have Donili's pizza, nothing else will be good enough! The employees are very warm and the owner is a total hoot and really fun to chat with. We are already looking forward to our next dinner here:)"}
{"text":"We ordered the artichoke dip and wings for appetizer and the veggie pizza with pepperoni added.  The dip was fine, nothing special.the wings were actually pretty good - crispy and spicy (we ordered the mild). The pizza was pretty good although it took a while to get (not sure why since out was us and one other couple).  All in all, a decent carry out place with pretty good pizza AND wings, which is harder to find than it should be. Wouldn't recommend eating there because although theyre nice, the timeliness just isn't there.  Also, my friend said they were put of soap in the mens room so I hope to god they had some in the kitchen."}
{"text":"My stupid iPod will not let me \"check in\" says I'm 6 miles away. Anyway I just ate a  monster Donili, Mortadella Santana. Massive and very good. Homemade sausage... I love this place, only been here twice but loved it both times... they kept my diet coke very full."}
{"text":"Place is great!! Had a buy one get one free coupon and they let us keep it for another time. Best pizza I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I go to Donili's for 3 reasons. The amazing variety of pizza - many different topping varieties. The private bar area. And, the friendliest owner and waiter I've met in Scottsdale. These guys go out of their way to treat you with excellent hospitality and I've brought several of my friends to eat here. Check it out at least once, you won't regret it! Find it on the northeast corner of Thomas and Hayden."}
{"text":"I received a coupon in the mailer for a jumbo 1 topping pizza for $9.99 and after reading the reviews on Yelp I decided to give it a shot.  We ordered the Mexico pizza and a simple pepperoni as our coupon pizza and added an order of calamari.  The calamari was definitely not worth the $8.99 they were charging for it, didn't much like it after the 1st two pieces and the pepperoni pizza was only ok, not nearly as good as I would have gotten at Hungry Howie's or Streets of New York.  The Mexico pizza, however, was the best part of the meal.  The toppings were fresh and crisp and the flavor was amazing.  If you're going to check this place out I would recommend their specialty pizzas as opposed to a traditional pizza.  It just blew our mind."}
{"text":"Would give it 2 1/2 stars, but can't do that.  Carried out, but the atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. Unfortunately, they are in a bad location that doesn't get much foot traffic, other than people going to the neighboring laundromat.  We ordered the following food:  1) Carnivore's pizza - The pizza was good, not great, just good. We did thin crust, but wasn't as crisp as I am accustomed to for thin. Also, with a name like \"Carnivore's\" I was anticipating a meat lovers style pizza, but the meat was not as plentiful as the name would suggest. I enjoyed it, but can't say it was more than good.  2) Breadsticks - We really enjoyed these. They were soft and had mozzarella on the inside.   3) Spinach and Artichoke dip - HORRIBLE! This is not an exaggeration. The dip was obviously one that is microwavable a la TV dinner style plastic container where you rip the thin plastic top off. Merely sprinkling fresh cheese on top does not make it restaurant quality.  I regret not trying the wings, but thought in the interest of trying some different items I did not see mentioned in the other reviews I could get a better appreciation for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little pizza joint! First time I stopped in, my brother and I had walked here, right before a haboob hit. The waitress offered to drive us home! We ended up staying for another couple rounds and the storm passed, but the same level of customer service is offered every visit!  I've only had the pizza and bruschetta, but each time I have really enjoyed it. With seemingly hundreds of pizza choices nearby, I will always choose donili!"}
{"text":"We were stuck in Scottsdale doing some laundry. This place hit the spot. It was cozy, comfortable, and the staff was so nice. The pizza was tasty and they had a decent selection of beer to go with it!   The buffalo wings were also pretty good too.  I hope that you will give this place a try. For the good pizza and the very nice staff who made our meal pleasant.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"This pizza is very very legit. It is right there with the finer pizzas of the valley.  Get the house special.  The Brazilian Cabreza (sic) on pizza is very good. I have never really had that before but it goes perfect on a tomato pie!   Don't go there expecting domino's type pizza and wings and that kind of crap.  This is high end quality stuff.  Nice little quiet place, and great place to take a date."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, super cute place for a quiet date or family dinner. The owner, Ren, has amazing Brazilian stories and sayings - possibly the best part of the experience."}
{"text":"I was presently surprised the first time I had Donili Pizza. I thought it was gonna be average, like all the other delivery pizza around. Boy was I wrong! The flavor is unique and tasty.. Thank you Donili Pizza Kitchen!  If you're looking for a change a pace, Try  this pizza. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"A cool little pizza bar that I've lived close to for years, but never ventured into until recently.  Just wanting a pizza while we watched the ASU game, we ended up ordering from Donili's.  Donili's is partnered with eat24hours.com, so online ordering for delivery and takeout is available.   The website had a three dollar delivery charge, so since it's right around the corner I decided to pick it up instead.  Another down note; the website accepted American Express, but when I arrived, the owner said he'd have to up charge me to use the card.  He said he's trying to get it off the website, but for some reason, it hasn't been removed.  Fortunately, I had another card.  But I'm stuck wondering what would've happened if I had gone with delivery.  The menu has some unique choices.  Some of the international pizzas looked like they'd either be really tasty (or really gross).  We ordered a veggie-licious pizza with chicken.  Pretty good, but not great.  I really appreciate how fresh the ingredients are, but for some reason, it didn't come together on the pie all that well.  This certainly isn't a bad pizza.  I enjoyed it and would order it over any of chain delivery places any day.  But when compared to many other options in the South Scottsdale area, Donili's didn't really stand out.  If you're into MMA, it looks this is the the hangout.  When I walked in to pick up my order, there were about a dozen people inside, all watching the fight on the TV.  I'd rather watch football on a September Saturday, but to each their own."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place and it let me down enough for me to want to 1- not go back back and 2- write this review. All they had to do is take care of the person that was already in their building and they didn't. So easy - Restaurant 101..."}
{"text":"$35 got us a dried out, limp, cold, tasteless pizza - we didn't even eat it all - and \"spinach & artichoke dip\" that I'll bet came out of the freezer section of the local grocer's.  First and last time ordering from / eating there.  Seriously - if you're looking for something yummy you'd do better with Pizza Hut than this place!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great pizza joint.  I went last night for dinner and right from the beginning Ren the owner came to the table and made sure everything was great throughout the meal.  He gave recommendations which were all great.  While waiting between courses he would come over and chat and you really get the feel he loves what he does and when you taste his food you can tell the love come out in it.    I think Ren adds a unique touch that many places have lost in having that place to go where you feel important as a customer and he really cares what you think about his food.  He wants you to be happy and walk/roll away full.    The place looks small from the outside but once you go in it's actually a good sized space.  They have a decent sized patio as well for great weather dinning.    The Mexican pizza is a must and the Brazilian wings were very unique.  For dessert Ren personally made the bananas flambe with ice cream and it was a great way to cap off the meal.    If you've never been you gotta try this place out and you won't be disappointed.  I will for sure be back there are a lot of pizza's on the menu I still want to try.    Thanks for a great meal and experience Ren"}
{"text":"Donili's Pizza Kitchen is a quaint location going West on Thomas right before you hit Hayden.  It is a quaint location that is hard to find if you are driving by fast.    I have been looking for a local mom/pop pizza place near where I live.  I literally live 1 mile away from this place, and I would walk if it wasn't so hot during the summer.  They advertised their international pizzas with the favorite being the Pizza from Mexico.  I got a small 10 inch pizza that had red enchilada sauce instead of normal tomato sauce.  It had grilled chicken, cheese, and a dash of thousand island on top.  It had a very nice kick to it.  One nice thing is that they serve beer on tap and wine.  A lot of pizza venues will have limited options, but I was able to order a tasty Blue Moon."}
{"text":"I have now been to this place 5-6 times and it still gets top marks from me.  The food is ALWAYS excellent, and everybody that I bring here loves it.  Since my last visit I have tried tried their Pepperoni (If you can't make a good pepperoni, you're in trouble), which was excellent.  One of their international pizzas, the Australian (peppered roast beef, rosemary, mozzarella, parmesan and cheddar cheeses, oregano, thyme, basil, sprinkled feta cheese), was quite tasty. The rosemary really added a lot of flavor.  I will say that for $21.99 for a 16\" pizza, I really felt there should have been more meat on there, especially since the beef was basically the only \"topping.\"  But as I've said, the quality is excellent, and you pay for quality...  This isn't Hungry Howies!   As far as non-pizza fare goes, I tried the lasagna, and all I can say is magnifico!!  it has a ton of flavor and is very complex.  there are so many flavors to taste you really have to eat it slow to get the full appreciation!  As always, the owner and the waitstaff are super friendly and eager to please.  One thing I have noticed is that while the service is excellent (much improved since my first visit), don't plan to eat and run here...  They make everything fresh; so while it is well worth the time, it does take time...  And you really want to do that here since the food deserves to be savored."}
