{"text":"Chilean sea bass - hmmmmmmmmmmmm.  I didn't pay, so nfi about the $$$  attentive, friendly service.  I'd go again, even if I had to pay!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money at all!!!  When ordering $35 lobster tails you expect to enjoy your meal. Instead I had a bland and tough meal. I was definitely full afterward but by no means satisfied in the taste department.  My boyfriend had the paella which tasted like it had just come from a box at a grocery store. It was a ton of food, but again, bland.   I'm thankful that we had a gift card to use here otherwise I would have hugely disappointed at my waste of money. I would not recommend this place for their dinners."}
{"text":"I'm going to tell you the end of this restaurant horror story and then you can decide for yourself if you'd like to read the rest or have had enough.   Ready?  As my friend and I are exiting Mallorca, the manager, who is shoveling food into his face at the bar, turns and says \"Sorry for the trouble girls...\" and spits his food all over us.   Now, let's bring it back to the beginning, if you're so inclined.   Upon recommendations, a passion for Spanish cuisine and armed with a groupon, my  friend and I decided to try Mallorca last Saturday evening.   We were greeted by eager, formal wait staff and were promptly seated. The dining room was ugly, out dated, and several shades of dark puke green. The plaster had multiple holes and the wall paper was water damaged and peeling away.   Aesthetics aside, we ordered the Sangria right away from hearing wonderful things and we were not disappointed.  For an appetizer we ordered the special that day, octopus. It arrived quickly. It wasn't bad. I've had better, but it tasted fresh and seemed to be carefully prepared and the presentation was eye catching.   For our main course, I badly desired the Paella Valencia. As a long time fan of Spanish/South American culinary specialties, I was dying for a good paella!   Our Paella Valencia arrived quickly. Excited about the paella, we barely noticed the small dish of random vegetables and the dish of potato chips they placed on the table (ummm thanks... how classy...and authentic...). As we scooped paella onto our plates and eagerly began to dig in, I barely had time to fully absorb the blandness of the dish when I noticed a man's HAIR pressed into my chorizo.   I flagged over the bus boy who was leaning miserably against the wall.  \"Hi, um, I have a hair in my Paella.\" Bus boy: \"Oh! Um. Let me get your waiter.\"  Our waiter promptly marched over and began collecting all of our dishes. I tried to speak to him, \"I'm extremely surprised to find this hair in the food.\" Waiter in his strong accent, \"Yes, ma'am, disappointing. But these things happen.\"  Wait. What?  \"Yes, I realize these \"things\" can happen, but it shouldn't, not in this fine restaurant.\" But he was gone before I could fully defend myself.  Then we waited. And waited. And waited. No one came out to apologize. No one asked us if we needed anything.   So I flagged the bus boy over again.  \"Hi, is your manager around?\"  Bus boy: \"Yes.\"   Pause.  \"Do you want me to get him?\" No. I just want to know where he is.  Me: \"Um. Yes, please get him.\"  The manager visits us for the first and ONLY time. He greets us with a look that says \"What do you want?\" I explained our little problem to him.   Manager: \"These things happen. \" Seriously? SERIOUSLY?  Me: \"Look, your restaurant comes highly recommended. I had high expectations and did not expect to find a hair in my paella...\"  Practically interrupting me he continues \"Yes, we have a fine restaurant. I have been in the business many years. These things just happen.\" Me (getting annoyed now with the lack of apology): \"Do they wear hair nets in the kitchen?\" Manger: \"Yes, of course. Besides, we have no women in the kitchen.\"  SERIOUSLY?   Not only is that SEXIST, I had to inform him that is was NOT  a woman's hair, but rather a short black hair that turned gray on the end, much like his own hair, and that it was PRESSED INTO MY CHORIZO WHICH I SCOOPED OUT OF THE PAELLA FROM UNDER RICE.   But, he clearly didn't want to hear it and walked away mumbling something that sounded like \"I'm disappointed.\"   Then our second paella arrived.   Our waiter apologized (finally) for the hair, only to proceed to tell us that \"This can happen easily. You could lift up your napkin and a hair could fall in.\"  Ugh...Am I out of line to hope and expect that wouldn't happen? Is there some ninja going around and hiding hair all over the restaurant? Do you have a shaggy dog folding your napkins?   The lobster, scallops, tiny micro sized shrimp all tasted the same: bland, frozen, overcooked, boring. The rice had no flavor and looked remarkably like the boxed paella rice that Goya sells. The chicken was dangerously undercooked- hard and pink. Needless to say, we had no appetite after all of this.   It wasn't hard to flag my actual waiter over this time. He had been standing in a corner ten feet away from our table with other waiters staring and pointing at us and talking about us in Spanish. Even if the paella was decent, we couldn't eat it while being stared at.  Waiter \"Would you like me to box this?\" Me: \"No. Just the check.\"  With a surprising twist, our waiter returned and informed us that this delightful meal would be on the house and then presented us with two shots of some sweet liquor.   We left our waiter a rather generous tip and got up to leave, feeling slightly vindicated.   We were chatting about the possibility of returning, when we met our manager at the bar on our exit...  Mallorca, you finally blew it when your manager blew his food on us."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. The food was not on par with other restaurants in town, esp for the price. We were also rushed in and out by the staff. I would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Just went here with my husband and our friends. The minute I sat down I was being pressured to pick something to drink. I ended up getting a pitcher of Sangria, I swear it didn't even have any alcohol in it. I've had better Sangria at the Olive Garden.   We sat outside on two tiny bistro tables pushed together. The tables rocked and almost fell over numerous times. The waiter crowded us every 3 minutes actually coming over to pour my drink for me from my pitcher of Sangria. This was an obvious ploy for a tip. He was interrupting our conversation and making things very awkward. A busboy was actually leaning on my friend's chair looking out onto carson st, her husband had to tell him to back off.   When we asked the waiter what the specials were he went on for what seemed like FOREVER! I thought it was ridiculous because the food was good but it wasn't worthy of almost 25.00 for the piece of salmon that I got. Also, I was supposed to get rice and veggies with my meal, instead, they brought the rice and vegetables out on separate plates and scooped some out for everyone. The waiter actually counted to three in Spanish as he scooped everyone some of MY yellow rice onto their plates. I literally paid 25.00 for a piece of Salmon with nothing on it. My husband is a vegetarian so he had to eat ravioli because they were out of everything else. RAVIOLI, seriously? They had four  or five things on the menu for vegetarians, and it was all pasta. So my husband ate Italian while the rest of us ate fake Spanish food. I guess my Salmon was Spanish because they sprinkled some Cayenne Pepper on my plate. Granted, the Salmon was big, I couldn't finish it, but I didn't bother taking it home because I had no sides like I was supposed to. Again, my sides got shared with the table, weird.   My husband and I drank that entire pitcher of Sangria and both of us suspected that it was so watered down with Ice that we got charged 20 dollars for something that tasted like fruit juice. We wanted to get a little buzz on our date night away from our daughter, instead we just felt bloated and sugary.  So, I ordered a gin and tonic for me and a beer for my husband and our friend. My G&T tasted like sugary tonic water and my husband's beer tasted like any ordinary light beer you can get on tap anywhere for 2$. We spend 17 dollars on three drinks, plus a 5 dollar tip because I felt so bad for the people serving us, they looked miserable. So, our meal was 75 dollars and our drinks were 17. That's 92 dollars plus a 20 tip. Sooooo 112 dollars for an ok piece of Salmon, some Ravioli and a pitcher of Sangria! What? Maybe i'm just not down with \"cultured dining,\" but I've definitely had better experiences at nice restaurants that I can eat my food on my own plate, be left alone by the staff, and get a nice buzz going for under 20 dollars.   It could have been a bad night for them. Luckily I had fun because of our friends. However, If I would have been there just with my husband I would have left after the 20 minute breakdown of the \"specials,\" after I was not even given a wine or beer list and forced to order in 10 seconds or less.   I believe this place is nothing but a scam. They kept calling me Señorita, ha ha. C'mon, you guys served my husband RAVIOLI."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the entrees, but I went here just for some appetizers and ordered the chorizo sausage and the \"spicy\" mussels. Neither were something I would order again and definitely not very memorable. The sausage was a bit dry and the mussels didn't have much flavor at all (although they were some massive mussels). We sat on the patio around 5 o'clock on a weeknight so no one was really there. The service was decent, yet when our food came out we had no silverware or napkins which definitely should never happen at a place this expensive. I think that I would maybe come back to try an entree, but only if I felt like spending $50 on myself..."}
{"text":"I love Mallorcas. The food is consistently delicious, the Sangria is amazing, and  Service is attentive and prompt. I recommend the Chilean Sea Bass and my husbands favorite is the Delmonico steak (both from the extensive list of specials). I have brought guests here a number of times and they are always impressed at how good the food is- not to mention how much you get. Arrive hungry- you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was attentive. The food generally was undercooked. The dessert obviously sat in a fridge overnight (perhaps several)."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our meal!!! Very over priced!  The meal lack flavor and creativity.  The rest Che was dry.  The paella was not good at all.  The Spanish sausage appetizer was so boring!!  The drinks where only ok.  Save you money and go some place down the street like Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"This is a truly overrated restaurant in Pittsburgh. I ordered stuffed oysters, steak, and flan.  Stuffed oysters came out pretty cold and it tasted very salty. I would give it no-go if you want to order this plate.  Steak is very bland. Simply very very bland. My friend who came with me ordered medium, but it turned out to be well-done.  Flan is really bad. I could only finished half of the plate. I've got a better flan for $1 in Bolivia.   The service is ok to bad. One guy seemed to be pretty rude to us and looked unhappy all of the time. Maybe he just had a bad day so I won't complain about this.  Overall, I don't recommend people to eat here. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I know this is an old school pittsburgh favorite.....but the sangria and paella are simply not good. have never seen a purple sangria before."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped shrimp in a brandy sauce!  Gazpacho is awesome, but much better in the summer than the winter.   The waiter reciting off the list of specials in his spanish accent is worth the price of admission. Sangria is divine"}
{"text":"Amazing! I went back to CMU recently with a bunch of friends and Mallorca was just as amazing as before. Portiions are huge. We had 9 people with 6 entrees, 2 appetizers, and 4 desserts, 3 pitchers of sangria and we were all stuffed....  Special:  2 pound lobster tail stuffed with crab and shrimp - excellent - I thought they would over cook it but it was perfect and extremely juicy.   We also had a special steak topped with gorgonzola cheese that was amazing (I think the steak was almost 2 pounds) - medium rare.   The calamari stuffed with prosciutto was awesome.   The sangria is great! It's not too strong or too sweet - but definitely will get you drunk."}
{"text":"This place has been here for years, and has a consistent and genuine old-world presentation. Give yourself a treat."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! We were blown away!!!! Waiters in a tux and one for every part of service to your dining experience!!!! Anything on the menu will blow you  away"}
{"text":"This might just be the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Awesome service, amazing food (and tons of it) and a great location. My favorite is the petite filet and all of the sides!!! Worth every penny bc it's so good."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and the restaurant was pretty empty.   The staff are very friendly and address you as señor or señorita.   I had the Tilapia with Shrimp in Champagne sauce ($13).  The seafood is fresh and tender and the sauce was sweet.  The entrees are served with rice, fresh vegetables, and fried potato chips, and the quantities will leave you feeling full.      They have a nice outdoor patio for when the weather is pleasant."}
{"text":"I've read many of the reviews. Any reviewer that said anything less than a fabulous dining experience is 100% erroneous. This restaurant is delightful. The service was excellent. Anyone who stated the staff was overly attentive- has obviously never been to a fine dining restaurant. The servers are all very knowledge, helpful, and friendly. The specials provided during last night's service were amazing. I wish I could have ordered them all. I was fortunate to arrive at 5pm and all the tables around me ordered about the same time so I could observe the entrees and hear the reviews.  The Kobe beef steak had to be well over 1lb. It looked amazing and the gentleman that eat it stated as much. His wife has the veal osso buco, although I was a bit dubious to order this here- she loved it. I never saw such large pieces of veal shanks. She loved it and said she would eat it over the next three days. The portions were huge.  My husband and I had the grilled calamari stuffed with prosciutto. It was amazing. Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and complemented the house bread well.   I ordered the Sangria. Typically, I prefer making my own as I enjoy a nice peach mint white Sangria. However, after reading the reviews on here I trusted my fellow positive food critics that enjoyed this place. I was not let down! It was not overly dry, as many others I have tried at other establishments in the past were. I even tend to enjoy most dry wines but for whatever reason never liked the red Sangria until I drank theirs. Hints of fruit were light and appropriate. Also, the liqueur blended in, likely Brandy, was not obtuse by any means.  Just subtle and lovely.    Then came the  house salad with a nice, spicy dressing. Something that reminds me of a French blend. Not my favorite, but the lovely mixture of greens, fresh herbs, and hearts of palm made me forget that I was n otin love with the dressing.  As i was craving fresh seafood, I splurged on the crab stuffed twin whole lobsters. Amazing. The lobster was cooked perfectly, the crab stuffing was lightly blended with cream and hints of cheese. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned-mixed with peas and carrots. Equally well, were the broccoli rabe and vegetable melody.  My husband ordered the grilled sea scallops in brandy. The scallops had a perfect sear to them, and the brandy sauce was not over powering. It was an excellent marriage. He loved this so much he has requested I make this sauce at home. I will try to do that this week =)  Compliments of the house, provided an almond after dinner liqueur-the name sadly has escaped me. Nevertheless, it was a perfect ending to a wonderful meal. I am not even a big fan of after dinner liqueurs, a bit too high in the calories. However, I don't care I will be ordering that again the next time we go!  As far as the prices, I think they are equivalent to any other fine dining establishment in the area. In fact, I think it is actually more than fair given the excellent service, free parking, and insane abundance of food. I will likely be dinning here at LEAST once a month."}
{"text":"Came here for \"Restaurant Week\" after hearing positive reviews from friends.  The group I went with all had the 3 course meal.  Pros: - Reservations on OpenTable - Parking lot next to the side of the restaurant - $5  - Friendly environment, not loud - Appetizers: Mix of shrimp, Portuguese sausage and calamari were good and the portion size was perfect - Service: Although the server was a bit strange with off the wall comments, overall all the waiters and staff were friendly.  Cons: - Main Course: Paella, Salmon and Filet. Salmon and Filet were not cooked properly / or as requested. The lobster in the paella was rough and didn't look fresh. Portion sizes were large, but not worth it due to the poor taste. - Desserts were awful. The cheesecake and chocolate cake tasted as if they were bought from local grocery store. One joke at the table was that there was freezer burn on the cheesecake.  We were glad we tried it, but will certainly not be back for another visit."}
{"text":"I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews - this place is a bit overpriced (for me at least).  I somehow manage to forget that when I think about how good the sangria is!   The portions are very generous.  I worked at a hotel in Oakland for awhile, and we sent people here all the time.  Most often, people came back raving about how great it was.  So, I'd say if you have the money it is a good bet.  However, vegetarians beware -- the last time I was there, there was not much to choose from."}
{"text":"Where to begin? I have ate here many times over the years and it's always been outstanding from the food to the service.. Great atmosphere ..The Stuffed Lobster w Crab meat is amazing and my favorite.The Wild Boar is my 2nd favorite and the rice and appetizers are always great"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Mallorca and our last!  We both had food poisoning from this dinner. Projectile vomiting for hours. Horrible, more horrible than I thought possible. It took us 2 days to feel normal again. Aside from that being one of the worst feelings I've ever experienced and never wanting to even look at that place again, here is the rest of my review if you care to read.  Don't bother asking them questions about the wine list! 2 different people came to our table to try to help and neither had a clue about any of the wines. We ended up picking randomly. I will admit, the food is pretty tasty on the way down. Can't say the same on the way up. We had veal osso bucco and the grouper seafood special, then peach and mango sorbet for dessert. You can tell the waitstaff is trying but they need more wine education and  they tried to take away our plates about every 2 minutes while we were still eating. That's all.  Hey Mallorca-clean your kitchen."}
{"text":"The service here is stellar. This has a very exotic menu, and I tend not to like exotic things, so those who like to try octopus would love it here. That being said, I still enjoyed my meal. I didn't pay for my meal though, but I think the prices are quite high. I might return for a special occasion but for me, there are other restaurants where I'd probably spend this money before returning here."}
{"text":"I thought the food here to be a little on the bland side.  The paella I had just didn't do it for me and though the steak is just shy of being an entire cow I was still reaching for the salt."}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed with this place.  Food was just okay.  The tables are way too close together.  Overpriced too.  The waiter lit off an entree and a piece of flame fell on the floor and he kicked it underneath an adjacent table.  I hope nobody had their purse on the floor!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and the servings were substantial. Minor improvements could make this an excellent restaurant. As there were quite a number of specials, it would be helpful to have them printed out. We were served small packets of butter with the bread which did not match what you are paying for a meal. The bread could be improved and they should standardize on olive oil. There were a number of flies around the table. The staff were carrying on conversations which took away from the ambiance and was distracting. We had the Portuguese sausage which was flavored well but was very dry. We were not provided with knives to cut the sausage so had to use our butter knives. The waiters were all very personable and knowledgeable.  We had the salmon and wild boar both which were delicious. The rice and vegetables were very good. The chips were so-so. These three are standard with every meal unless you request something different. We will give them another try as there are other menu items that got our attention, but it may not stay high on our list, especially at their price point, if the items above aren't corrected."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this quaint Spanish restaurant a few valentine's ago and have made it a point to make it back as often as possible. Traditional style Mediterranean cuisine served by an incredible staff (let them rattle of the 20 some specials of the day and you'll understand what i mean). Sometimes when i'm there I wish the portion sizes could be cut in half and subsequently the price but the next day when i can enjoy the leftovers at home I'm quite appreciative! As a quick final note, SIP the complementary shot that you receive at the end of your meal. It's a smooth delicious almond liquor', NOT some cheap tequila."}
{"text":"Mallorca delivers on great customer service reviews. Everything I read before coming here said to expect great things. The attention to detail from our waiter and all the bussers made my sister and I feel so welcome!   Valet parking, coat check at the door, a staff that knows the menu and specials inside and out, and little details like table crumbing and helping refill our sangria made this experience exceed my expectations.  I used a living social deal to save a few bucks, the bill was still no joke but if you go wild over A+ service then it's worth it and then some.  The dishes are large, so if you're into smaller plates use the $6 plate sharing charge to your advantage. One paella is going to feed me for a few days."}
{"text":"Mallorca continues to be one of our favorite restaurants in the area. The service is fantastic. The restaurant is always vibrant and full, yet the servers are diligent in keeping guests happy.  I have dined at Mallorca at least a dozen times and never tire of the menu because of the ridiculously huge amount of specials they offer. Large portions that are always well-prepared describe the dinner entrees. Our group had the spicy mussels from the apps menu (awesome) and stuffed mushrooms that were good. They are stuffed with crab and shrimp and I don't like shrimp or would rate them higher. Veal with Mozzarella, Kobe Steak, Yellow Fin Tuna with pepper sauce and Chilean Sea Bass were our entrees. Each one was better than the others, although my favorite was the tuna.     Trust your server to recommend a wine as their list is pretty extensive. We enjoyed an 08 Llai Llai Pinot Noir that was quite nice and selected based on the server's recommendation.  We will go back again and again. Just love it"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant in the South Side! We went for restaurant week but the entrees are on their normal menu. Everything had such a pop of flavor and was perfectly cooked. The only part of our meal that my boyfriend didn't enjoy was the dessert.   The shrimp appetizer is loaded with garlic! Definitely enough for two people. The stuffed oysters were very filling but I liked the shrimp more.  For entrees I had the chicken in cream sauce which was amazing. My boyfriend had a perfectly cooked fillet.   My lemon cake was awesome but his creme brulee was watery. They substituted it for him.  Awesome service, great wine, and great food! We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy Paella and large portions of it, Mallorca is the place to be!  With your order of entree you get an extra plate of spanish rice and steamed veggies and chips, and I would say if you are the type to enjoy leftovers for a weekend brunch, Mallorca will delight you!  The staff was very pleasant and friendly to work with, but I must warn you that on weekends the restaurant gets super crowded and noisy. Also, as the tables are so close to each other, you may find yourself unintentionally eavesdropping on other people's conversations, while at the same time, unable to follow conversation with a person sitting across from you at your table.  The prices are a bit steep, but considering the quality and quantity of food, I think the prices are justified. Also, if you look out for Groupons, you can get a sweet 50% discount.   I would recommend Mallorca for large groups (+4 people) and for celebrating occasions. Although I would not recommend it if you are planning to go on a special date."}
{"text":"Just finished having an early bday dinner. It was amazing!!!!  Hands down one of the best restaurants in town.  I remember when it opened 25 years ago and I was a kid.  Still an amazing place!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Generous pours at the bar, very good entrees. The appetizers were a bit small and weren't the best, go for the entrees. Get the 2lb. sirloin!"}
{"text":"Had reservations for Saturday night.  As stated by a previous reviewer, their table assignment system is somewhat strange.  People who didn't have reservations were being seated before people with reservations (um, why make a reservation, then?).  Very busy, had 5 different people waiting on us--none of whom were able to refill water as needed.  Food was average, nothing to write home about.  Much better options in the area than this!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner for Valentine's Day, I have never been there but my wife has. At first I wasn't impressed with the seating, table and atmosphere in general. The table was VERY small and we sat so close to the next table that you felt like you were having dinner with friends.   I warmed up to the restaurant after a while as I started to appreciate the ambiance. Our waiter was great, he was very cordial and attentive to the customers.   We started with our standard glass of wine, sorry I like my Cabs! We started with the stuffed calamari appetizer. It was enough to share which I'm glad we did. The calamari was stuffed with prosciutto and covered in a red garlic sauce that was scrumptious! Our salads were delivered pre-made with a house dressing which was reminiscent of thousand island. My wife had chicken in a white wine garlic sauce that was so light but full of flavor. The breasts were very tender and cut thinner than you expect. They brought vegetables, rice and their signature homemade potato chips. I know most people wouldn't like fried sliced potatoes with such a great meal but they're my favorite. I had the Monk Fish Diablo style which was spicy but nothing too much as my wife even liked it and spicy is not her favorite. I must say the monk fish was fabulous, the fish was cooked to perfection and adding the rice on the side mixed with the diablo sauce was to die for!  For dessert we shared a piece of tiramisu which was delightful, probably one of the best I have had.  I can't say enough about the service, our waiter was fabulous,  as I mentioned earlier,  very attentive to us and very personable,  he made the experience that much more enjoyable.  The entire staff was great, they kept things flowing and didn't leave dirty dishes sitting on the table.  I would recommend this place as the food and service was great. I think the ambiance is old world and you'll warm up to it if you allow yourself. I'll be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place cause it was so highly recommended to us but it was not meant to be. It was a Monday night so my party was the only one in the restaurant, which made for an awkward ambience. I felt like we were being waited on so much that it became uncomfortable. Also the food was pretty bad. The dishes were either flavorless, too salty, or blatantly spicy. The portions were out of control! My paella could have fed a party of 5 comfortably. Overall I wouldn't recommended the spot because after all what is a restaurant if the food isn't special enough to write home about?"}
{"text":"We're from Louisiana and came here with our cousins from the 'Burgh who couldn't say enough good things about Mallorca's. The service was absolutely wonderful. We had the Steamed Octopus for the appetizer and it was delicious.  Their Sangria is some of the best I've ever had.  My wife had the seafood platter which was almost too beautiful too eat. Their Wild Boar special is to die for and the stuffed grouper is awesome also.  So happy we came here for dinner this evening and I definitely recommend them!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience.  Had the sea bass with capers.  Perfectly cooked and tasty. Best sangria ever.  Service very attentive. Everyone in our party was happy."}
{"text":"Mallorca is the place to go for real Spanish or Basque dishes. My personal favorite is the paella- generous portions and deliciously prepared. It can get crowded on the weekends but go in the evening during the week. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service was excellent here. Our waiter was very attentive and provided shots and an appetizer on the house. The food was also very good. In particular my swordfish entree was well cooked and seasoned and my crime brûlée dessert was very good. There was a lot of food and overall the price was reasonable. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"This place is waaaay overpriced for the quality of food. I had two of the specials, grilled portobello mushroom and sea bass. The portobello was drenched in balsamic vinegar. Don't get me wrong, I love balsamic vinegar. I can just dip my bread in it plain but this was a very strong type and there was so much of it that I couldn't taste the mushrooms. As for the sea bass, I had asked for the olive oil drizzle to be removed and brought on the side (since in most restaurants in the Burgh, drizzle means drench) but it came with it anyways. When I complained, they took the fish and put it on a new plate with the olive oil scraped off. The sides that came with the entree were just sad. Some steamed veggies that tasted no different than steam in a bag grocery store variety and a bland rice with some peas.  The bill for these two plus one glass of wine was $55. I had a groupon but it was still way way overpriced for the quality. The only reason I am giving them two stars instead of one is I should have asked for the price of the specials. I just assumed that the price of the sea bass would at least be comparable to the grilled salmon, which was $21. I was wrong since it was $35 despite being  the size of my fist. I will not be going back to this place and I do not recommend this to anyone who values quality over quantity."}
{"text":"***5-star service*** wonderful atmosphere, attentive staff, great experience.  Saw this place for restaurant week and wanted to try a different part of town. Made reservations for lunch, which I highly recommend-even midday, this place filled up early. Our serving staff was wonderful, attentive, and made great recommendations. Fantastic cuisine, my husband had their homemade spinach stuffed ravioli while I went right for the filet mignon. Save room for dessert-their creme brulee and flan were excellent. Definitely an upscale vibe, special occasion type place, but not overly stuffy-by the end of the meal we felt like a part of the family. We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with great portions.  I haven't been so stuffed in a long time in Pittsburgh.  A lot of these other hipster trendy restaurants leave you walking away hungry.    I went for the restaurant week prix fixe last night.  I sat at the bar and had the stuffed calamari & octopus.  I underwhelmingly expected some small grilled little pieces with a lotus flower, a drizzle of reduction, and 2 little carrots, but.....it was the biggest portion I've ever seen of octopus and it was great!  I was so satisfied and full at the end that I totally forgot the desert that came with it."}
{"text":"Had a pretty good dinner at Mallorca, close to 5 stars, but not there (which is probably a lot, considering I am from Spain, and the owner is not). I started with a Gazpacho that was not very good. It lacked the texture and the taste, so I was anticipating a poor meal. Luckily, I had also ordered an octopus appetizer. The octopus was extremely tender, cooked to perfection. Unfortunately the potatoes that went with it were undercooked. That was kind of sad. It is so hard to cook octopus well that it is unfortunate to have the potatoes miss the bar. By the way, the portion of octopus was huge. I then had an excellent entree of Monkfish, very fresh and well cooked. I thought all the side dishes (chips, vegetables, and rice were unnecessary and did not add anything to the meal, honestly). I finished with the catalan-style Creme Brulee.  The wine list is pretty good and I was able to find some excellent spanish wines, although they are a bit overpriced. I went for a Priorat (Camins by Alvaro Palacio).  The service was pretty good, and they even offered free ham and cheese and liquor. That is very \"typical spanish\" so it gave it a nice touch.  I felt it was overall a very good experience although maybe a bit pricey. If I had known portions were so huge, and there were so many side dishes I might have skipped some of the appetizers though."}
{"text":"We go to Mallorca for rare special occasions, and I just love it.  Yes there are a couple of things I would like to see change - side dish options, for example.  But there is so much to love!  The veal in mozzarella cream sauce is simply out of this world.  My husband's fish dishes are always great.  My son, the foodie, raved about his stuffed lobster special.  Said it was the best lobster he has ever had, and he has eaten lobster at some classic seafood restaurants in the Boston area.  The service is fun, and the lovely accents of the handsome waiters add to the delight, for me.  I also love the complimentary Portuguese almond liquor at the end of the meal - very nice.  Be prepared to spend some significant money, but worth it for special occasions."}
{"text":"A fantastic Pittsburgh eatery. The portions are large. The steaks are fantastic, and the seafood is very fresh. A reservation is definitely required as this place packs them in."}
{"text":"Okay, so last week I went here with my Dad and his girlfriend Suzy. The owner, Antonio is very personable and was very kind to us as we entered. I've also noticed that each of the four times I've been here, he was also there. Excellent to have the owner/operator around to keep things top shape.  Sat us in a corner this time, wallpaper is a bit old, building is a bit dingy, and yes the dining area and lounge have a bit of traffic, but it's fine with me. Adds to the experience, gives the restaurant character, etc.   Food was great, I went with the wild boar special. Alongside were two Delmonico steaks covered in sauteed mushrooms and Gorgonzola cheese. Delicious! Wild boar was done well, also tasted like a exotic pot roast, but no gamy taste to speak of.  Got three side-salads that were decent, but yea, were covered in dressing. Vegetables on a dish were steamed and lightly buttered.  Fresh bread was good.   Another great thing about Mallorca is the portion size. An eating-persons restaurant; you will be lucky to finish half of the portion of most dishes, so expect to have some leftovers or the opportunity (at $6) to get a second plate to share.   Also, Sopa de ajo for any garlic lovers."}
{"text":"I have lived in the South Side for 3 years and have never thought to give Mallorca a try. I must have been skeptical of Spanish cuisine. I was so wrong!!  I went for a celebration with my family and we had 4 employees waiting on us. It was the best service I think I've ever had in Pittsburgh (and I eat out a lot). I got the filet with manchego cheese and it was humongous. The sauce was so good I thought I couldn't finish it, but I did. Everything was delicious, including the appetizers.  I highly recommend the sangria. My sister got lobster ravioli and they asked if she wanted red or white sauce and gladly appeased her request for a mixture of both (pink sauce). At the end of dinner we got complimentary almond liquor shots for our celebration.   Summary: food was mouthwatering delicious and service was amazing. My drink was NEVER empty. Pricey but worth the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"This is my first one star, but I've never been more dissatisfied with a meal at this price point.  The servers, host, runners all spoke unintelligible English, which fine a lot of ethnic leaning places don't, but they were so unapologetic about it/had about 6 different specials none of which written down and only rattled off by a completely uninterested...host?  I'm not sure, we had multiple people visiting our table and refilling water glasses and asking if we want more booze.  Should have taken them up on it....When our food finally came, it looked ok but had no discernible flavor and the textures were all wrong and way overcooked, crimes against catfish.  I don' t even know what it was we officially ordered but it sounded pretty good from the bits and pieces of the description.  Almost inedible though and for about 30 bucks a plate, how does a Spanish restaurant fuck up Spanish Rice? Couldn't wait to get out of there, not to mention the decor and carpeting badly need to be replaced or better yet just shut it down"}
{"text":"Very good Paella!!!! We ate outside and watched the motorcycles cruise down Southside's Carson Street... If you like Spanish cuisine you love this joint. The potatoes are addicting and the gazpacho has just the right kick. The Very large portions leave one satisfied!"}
{"text":"The environment is really pleasant and the food we ordered were really good. We ordered paella, chicken breast with creamy mozzarella sauce, stuffed chicken breast, calamari and portobello. The portion was really big that we weren't able to finish it and had to pack them home. The price is within a reasonable price, and they deliver your food out within a timely manner. The staff are nice and helpful with recommending dishes, they constantly came to my table and asked if the food was good. The reasons I am giving them a 3 start is that they assumed I speak Mandarin (I am an Asian) and they attempted to greet me in Mandarin. I found that offensive and rude. And also, when I eat slow, it doesn't mean that I am done, so DO NOT ask if I am finished eating and try to take my food away from my table. I am here to the restaurant to eat and relax and enjoy, not to shove food into my stomach and leave. Please, DO NOT assume all asian/ Chinese looking people are all from China and speak Mandarin. It would be as rude if I assume all Spanish/ Hispanic/ Latino looking people are Mexican."}
{"text":"Look at the pictures people have posted, the food tastes even better.  Mallorca is the old world classy restaurant you may be looking for.  The service is unbelievable.  The food is even better.  Dress up a little and make it a night like your great-grandparents likely enjoyed back in the day at a nice restaurant.  Because this is some kind of experience to enjoy."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there over the weekend. It was absolutely delicious. We definitely paid a pretty penny for what we got, but it was well worth it. The paella was amazing. I loved it! My husband got the stuffed lobster tail. It was the biggest lobster tail either of us had ever seen. Prepare to be stuffed when you leave here. The wait staff was also very efficient and professional."}
{"text":"This restaurant was great. I loved the atmosphere, it was in a part of Pittsburgh that I had never been to. I loved the Paella, it had a great variety of spanish sausage, lobster tails, and many other things. It was great food."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! A friend took me here before a concert on tues. Was my 1st time here. Wow!! Service was incredible, portions were unbelievable,  and the dishes were so yummy. Their sangria was the most delicious! Very reasonably priced for quality and quantity of food (and sangria). Dessert was devine. Can't wait to take my husband here!!"}
{"text":"It's been a while but I'm really looking forward to going back here. Love the shrimp in garlic sauce, lobster ravioli and mmm the suckling pig. Don't forget to get a pitcher of their Sangria! Excellent service too!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely not a tapas/small plates restaurant - it has a few appetizers, but it's mainly for main courses.  Although the service was very attentive and friendly and the portions are huge, the food just sucks.  The shrimp is a bit questionable.  I had bacon wrapped shrimp as my main course and the bacon was soggy, which made the meal disgusting.  Moreover, the meal comes with a side of boiled vegetables (which is a throw away as they lack seasoning/flavor) and a side of \"Spanish\" rice, which I think is really Goya Mexican rice seasoning thrown onto rice.  I personally would not go back...unless there are major changes to the quality of food."}
{"text":"Over rated and over priced.  I keep getting suckered in to going back and each time i leave with my very lite wallet I always am like, why, why why did i fall for mallorica again.   If they lowered the prices i think i would be more satisfied with the food."}
{"text":"This place thrives on a circus atmosphere rather than good food. Apparently local celebrities are meant to make up for dull food. A boring over priced menu boasts big European flavors that end up blah. Don't buy into the hype. This is a has been kinda place. The only good thing I had was the stuffed squid app."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for our anniversary and quick road trip. Small local restaurant that had a homey feel to it. All of the food was great, and the service was excellent. Definitely recommend the paella, you get your money's worth in seafood. And if they have the ribeye as a special, I would recommend getting that as well. Both were well prepared and flavorful. Our server Augustine was so kind and attentive. He would check on us through our dinner and gave us a little surprise for our anniversary. If you're in the area, I would suggest you check it out!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, staff rough around the edges and bad food. A group of four of us went there with very high expectations after reading yelp and left disappointed. It took an hour for us to be seated. Once we finally had a table and ordered, it took nearly an hour for us to be even served. I ordered 35$ lobster tail in wine sauce and it was dry and chewy. My vegetarian friend ordered veggie paella and what she received was literally a plate of rice with like 10 peas....and what really pissed us off is that the restaurants complimentary dish for the table was a plate of paella style rice...basically the same exact thing they charged her 20 bucks for.   The service was just plain bad.   The food was overpriced and lame."}
{"text":"I wish I took pictures.  I doubt I can adequately describe the meal.  Our friend had the white sangria ... yum.  We started with the portabella with mozzarella appetizer ... very generous portion ... comfortably served 3.  The house salad was very good.  I had a large piece of salmon.  Others at our table had the scallops wrapped in bacon and lamb chops.  Fresh vegetables and rice were served family style.  I could have made a meal on just the vegetables and rice.  The dessert tray came out ... it was tempting ... we all chose a sorbet.  The lemon sorbet was served in a lemon.  My mango was served in a halved mango and the watermelon was served on a huge slice of watermelon rind.   The almond liquer served at the end of the meal could easily become addictive.  I asked the owner about purchasing a bottle at the liquor store.  Apparently the label on the bottle changed and the LCB hasn't given it a new code.  I will add it to my future purchases list.  Looking forward to coming back.  Another accolade ... free parking next door to the restaurant."}
{"text":"When people talked about the portion size being big, we thought it only applied to dinner. We came here for lunch and the portions were huge. I agree the decor was a bit underwhelming when you first walk in, but during the day the light coming through the skylight makes the room beautiful. The entrees all came with a salad, yellow rice and vegetables. I had monkfish, and hubby had steak. The Diablo sauce on my fish was so delicious that my husband asked our waiter for more to put on his steak and rice. To our surprise, the kitchen maid extra sauce just for him. All the wait staff were very nice. We'll want to be back."}
{"text":"Mallorca is great the first time you go, after that it is just ok.  Menu never changes, specials are always the same.    Service is excellent.  Overall food is good, but a little to pricey.    Decent date place on the outside patio."}
{"text":"I love this place. Almost every time I'm in town this is a must do on my list! I always order something off the very long list of specials (after getting the paella the first time...which was amazing!). This most recent trip we got the sausage special for an appetizer that was cooked table side in a ceramic pig...that was adorable. I got the prime rib special and it was probably bigger than my head. It was amazing! And you can't forget about drinks! The pitchers of sangria are a must have and the staff never lets your cup get empty!  The thing that sets this place apart from other places, though, is the service. Everyone is so friendly and fun and really make you feel valued. This trip was a celebration of my friends birthday which I noted in my opentable reservation. Everyone greeted her and wished her happy birthday. They even brought out a piece of chocolate cake for her and one for me too! They even had a candle in it and got so many people to sing. It was great.   We finished the night with a Spanish coffee, which is also amazing, and more sangria. The vibe of this place is amazing. We stayed and laughed and ate for almost 4 hours and at no point felt rushed or not welcome. Very European and authentic approach to meals!  I will always continue to come here and it will always be my favorite! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal menu & staff! Recently tried the sirloin with prosciutto and fried egg, blew my f#*king mind! The veggie quinoa & sangria helped wash it down. Even the birthday cake they served me was pretty good. I have to mention the special I had the previous time visiting this fine venue, a whopping 22 oz rib-eye prepared med-rare. Trust me guys, its worth the money."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to go to Mallorca and when we got a gift card I quickly booked a reservation with Open Table.  It was quiet for a Tuesday night and a weird atmosphere but a nice cozy spot for date night. The service was excellent-from taking our order quickly to refilling our water and Sangria.  We went with a pitcher of their famous Sangria. It was plenty for 2 people-not too sweet and they only have the option of red.  The entrees come with a salad which was a pleasant surprise.  The salad had cucumbers, lettuce and tomato with a French type dressing that was very tasty.  For my entrée I went with the petite filet with a white pepper sauce that I asked for on the side. Glad I did as it was too sweet for me for a steak sauce.  The filet was cooked just right. It came with an abundance of sides including rice, cooked veggies and Spanish potatoes which were just homemade chips.   My date got the paella which had rice, baby lobster tail and mussels-it was a huge portion. We somehow managed to save room for dessert and shared a piece of dark chocolate cake-the icing was good but the cake was pretty dry.  The prices are a bit high but you do get a lot of food."}
{"text":"This is the sort of place you might expect to be mediocre.It turns out to be surprisingly good.I had the best  cabrito I've ever had here .The chorizio and sangria were good as were the fish dishes .The service was professional and attentive.It is actually better than most of the Spanish places in Newark.It is  also in an interesting lively neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food was great.. Liked the Goat curry soaked in wine.. They gave rice which was very nice  Shrimp appetizer was spicy but nice with Wine  Good food.. Lot so order less  I found it little costly"}
{"text":"Actually I am not a big fan of this restaurant. The paella here was good but to me not very impressive."}
{"text":"Great food and service! You look for the most delicate and exquisite presentation of the food you'll probably be disappointed. But, if you weigh more on the quality and flavor of the food, this is the right place to go. Our first app is grilled portabella w balsamic sauce, which tastes fantastic! The portabella is seared to perfection, a little crispy outside and meaty inside. The balsamic sauce on top gives it an acidic touch and really makes the magic! Our another app is grilled chorizo and is delicious as heaven. For entree, we have two dished on the special menu, the whole fish for my friend and the crab filled lobster for me. I loooove my lobster. The meat is not hard or overcooked at all and it retains all the freshness and flavor of the lobster. Also it tastes amazing w the lemon juice. My friend loves her fish. It was presented as an intact fish and they deboned it on table side. They have a dessert tray and we tried four of them. I love the citrus tart, or at least I think it's a citrus tart. Other desserts are just normal good. The service is among the top. After we were seated, three different servers offered to take our order for the drink. And they offered two drinks on the house. This place deserves a five star and I will come here again for sure in the future!"}
{"text":"I don't get the \"over priced\" complaint here. It was ~$80 for lunch, two people, two glasses of wine each, a starter, and two entrees. Portions are too enormous for me, but an even better value for a burger-pounder.  Beyond that, the food is \"pretty good\", and the service is extremely attentive. Decor: confusing and outdated, or charming and authentic, depending on your attitude. Take the outdoor seating if it's an option.  A good option for a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Really bad experience. First of all, it was SUPER noisy which made the whole experience super unpleasant. The waiter came over to tell us about the \"specials\" which I put in quotes because his list, recited with a smug smile of someone proud to have memorized that much, was way longer than the menu. But we had some questions about the specials but as he said the last word, he walked away! But eventually he returned and we asked our questions and placed our order. That was at 7:15pm. We got our salads right away but at around 8pm, we asked our waiter what was taking so long. \"Two more minutes,\" he said. Twenty minutes later it arrived. I had ordered the asparagus ravioli which came over cooked and my husband's paella was soggy. But we had tickets to a show and there was no time to ask them to fix it, and besides, the waiter didn't bother to ask if everything was okay. They offered us free dessert but we didn't have time after having to quickly eat our dinners, but we asked for them to compensate us in some other way instead. They refused. Only go there if you want poor service, long wait times for substandard food, and a manager that couldn't care less. The good part? Good mints at the door."}
{"text":"I have been to Mallorca many times for lunch and have always enjoyed the food and good service. In fact, the service was one thing I always liked about Mallorca because it was always very attentive and professional. I recently dined there with my family to celebrate a birthday. While we sat down and were deciding what to order for appetizers and drinks, the server seemed very impatient. His attitude continued until we ordered our entrees. The calamari arrived and was extremely chewy to the point of being inedible. My husband complained to our server about the quality of the calamari. He quickly became very annoyed and irritable. He wanted to know what we'd like instead. Being that we had 5 people in our party, I asked him how many shrimp were included in the shrimp appetizer. He also seemed annoyed by my question and gave me an abrupt answer. After this, he disappeared and we never saw him again until later when we left the restaurant and saw him sitting on the sidewalk smoking a cigarette. Obviously, he was having a bad night, but it's a shame his poor service and attitude had to put a damper on our evening. It makes me reluctant to recommend this restaurant given the poor service we experienced on this visit."}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly servers. I had the calamari stuffed with prosciutto and it was wonderful. A little spicy, which was perfect. Person next to me had the wild boar and it looked like a boar quarter. It looked very tender and he said it was excellent. A lot of items here are marinated for days."}
{"text":"Circuses = 9 Food = 5  The food here is not so awesome.  But the ambience is what you are coming for.  Spanish waiters yelling at each other, yelling at you, yelling at the food! Sangria, lots of it!  You feel like you are dining in spain or portugal, or some other country. Or at least some other city. A more exotic city with yelling waiters.   I should mention, they have a cute courtyard which is nice in the summer.  All in all, this place is fun for visitors and a group, but don't be expecting gourmet foods. Plates are around $20/each, and you HAVE to get Sangria!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Mallorca was really quite nice.  I got a table outside on a lovely day, and besides one pestering fly and an over-zealous breeze, it was very pleasant.  I started with an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms.  The mushrooms were cooked very well (they were still solid, not overly done and mushy) and the stuffing had a nice taste although I found it to be a bit on the liquidy side.  For my meal I had the veal with mozzerella sauce.  It came out in an iron dish that had obviously come straight from the oven, and I had at least five pieces of veal swimming in a delicious cheese sauce that was slightly darkened on the top, which I loved.  The veal may have been sliiiightly overdone, but it had a very nice flavor and went with the sauce very nicely. The only minor complaint I have is that the service was a little inconsistent.  I arrived for dinner right at 5pm on a weekday with a friend, and we were two of possibly four total people in the restaurant at the time.  I guess the staff was feeling rather bored, because whenever we would need attention at our table, we were surrounded by a minimum of three servers.  Which was very attentive and I appreciated the service, although it did make me slightly uncomfortable.  But the really uncomfortable thing was whenever our servers were done helping us, they stepped back about three feet and just stood behind our table the entire time.  Now THAT was uncomfortable.  And slightly creepy.  But we got all of our food in a very timely manner, which was excellent.  But then as the restaurant started to fill up, we requested our bill, and ended up waiting about 20 minutes for it.  We figured they had forgotten about us, until the bill finally arrived and we realized it had been laying on top of the servers' station a few feet from us the entire time.  So they didn't forget about us, just the bill.   So although the service went from practically sitting on my lap to forgetting that we weren't trying to do a dine and dash, the food really was quite good and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went with a large group for my husband's birthday to Mallorca. We chose it because we both lived in Spain and love Spanish food. They had great wine, great food, and a genuine culture. We loved the paella! The serving sizes were large and they provided a birthday cake for free for our whole table. The staff were friendly, generous, and attentive. Definitely recommend this place for the food and culture. If you're looking for something fancy though, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been here at least once a year for last 10 years since a good friend introduced us to it.  Amazing service, sangria, and the food is off the charts. Take time to always listen to alllll the specials bec they usually beat the socks off the already amazing regular menu. Nothing they serve isn't amazing including their class and charm!"}
{"text":"2.5 years ago my boyfriend at the time came here for our first date. It was amazing food, service and overall experience. The Sangria was AMAZING as well.  We recently got married and before went there with family and friends to celebrate where we first went out.  Everything was fabulous! The food, ambiance, service and again, the Sangria.  We all got different entrees and everyone loved theirs! We had asked about a kids menu and although they did not have one they offered us several options that worked! Above and beyond! They even provided him with some entertainment during the wait (which was not long for an adult, but can be for a child).   I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Authentic Spanish food for sure.  Having lived in Valencia, Sangria and Paella are the Holy Grail of Mediterranean Spanish food and should not be attempted by amateurs or family restaurants.  Mallorca pulls off both for the perfect Spanish meal while the restaurant itself gives you a European atmosphere (though not particularly Spanish to be honest). Paella had a great Spanish rice, rabbit, chicken, mussels, lobster, scallops, shrimp and vegetables all cooked into perfection.   Went here for my birthday with the fam so price was not an issue (always a great way to get a feel for a restaurant - not pay).  The staff actually were Portuguese but were friendly and helpful with the menu and attending to our table.  At the end of the night, they had caught wind that it was my day and brought out a large cake for us all without anyone having to drop hints.  Definitely going back when I can afford it on my own."}
{"text":"This place is pretty high class. Definitely not my usual choice for dinner because I'm poor, but my friend had a food voucher so we got a pretty good discount. The restaurant looked kind of small from the front, but there are multiple rooms and levels inside. The service was exceptional. I feel like there were more waiters than tables. We were waited on by like 5 different waiters. The one waiter recited the whole menu to us and made sure to roll his r's...rrrrrrrrroasted.     We started with bread and butter. The bread was fluffy and fresh. For a high-class restaurant, I expected high-class butter, but instead they used packaged butter. A small plate of salad with honey mustard dressing preceded our main course. I ordered the Pollo Mallorca, which is chicken breast stuffed with spinach, raisins and pinenuts in this gravy-like sauce. My order came with a side of Spanish rice. The sweetness of the raisins really added a unique kick. The chicken was a little tough and overcooked though. The sauce tasted like gravy. I think I enjoyed the rice the most--perfect texture and spices.    Overall Mallorca was pretty good, but the food wasn't really worth it for the high prices. The service was excellent though...they even clean up your breadcrumbs and scoop your food for you. It was kind of excessive, but if you want to be treated like royals...Mallorca will pamper you."}
{"text":"We had the Jamon Serrano and the bocquerones just for tapa at 3 in the afternoon. Good fortification! Tasty but expensive"}
{"text":"Just had a good meal. My wife, sister , and I were on the South Side and decided to give this place a try. We had the fried calamari appetizer, which was wonderful. The pieces of squid were larger than usual, extremely tender and juicy; 2 out of 3 of us thought it was the best we've ever had. My wife had a red sangria, which I tried, we both thought it was really good. For entrees they each ordered the lobster raviolis, one in a white sauce, the other red. The white was great and really complimented the lobster ravioli. By-the-way, there was more lobster in these than I've ever seen before. The red sauce had a good flavor, but didn't go with the lobster ravioli at all, it was too overpowering. I ordered one of the many dinner specials, swordfish in balsamic. My fish was overcooked (dry) but the sauce was delicious. I'd go back, and rated it 3 stars. P.S. They gave us each a shot of almond liquor when they delivered the check!"}
{"text":"Completely overpriced and totally underwhelming. That about sums it up. We had a girls night out and one of the ladies suggested Mallorca. I knew the bad rep Mallorca had (my husband and I ate here a few years ago and I have the same opinion now I had then) but I thought just maybe they have listened to the masses and changed their ways. Nope. Sorry to say they have not changed a thing.  I ordered one of the specials of the day, sea bass and I looooooooove sea bass. I can never turn down a good thick piece of that fish. One friend ordered the paella and the other gal ordered a dish I don't know the name of but it was a seafood dish with a few different types of seafood. But out first came the salad that had way too much dressing on it (dressing was totally meh). When my sea bass was delivered I was so incredibly disappointed. It was this teeny little flat square that had been seared with way too much oil (I had even asked that they skip the butter lemon sauce because instinctively I knew it would be swimming in it). It was totally greasy, yet at the same time undercooked. I didn't know that the sides were served family-style so I thought that was all I got but it wouldn't have mattered. The side of vegetables was totally greasy as well and not creative in the least. Totally bland. The rice is exactly as all the other reviewers have described: Rice a Roni meets Zatarains. Totally bland and  you cannot convince it didn't come from a box. My friend's paella was terrible. Bland, overcooked and soupy. My other friend didn't even eat half of her seafood meal. And the final straw was when I got my check and saw that they charged $39.95 for my fish. Wha???? Pah-lease. Those are the same prices as Wild Rosemary and their food is absolutely stupendous and worth every penny. So fresh, so creative. This was total junk and a meal I could have gotten for half the price at Max and Erma's, or even better yet, Eat-n-Park. It was so bad.  Yes, the service was great but who cares when you're so disappointed and angry about being so stooped on your meal?? I can't believe this place still gets business. And the service was actually a little annoying. The main server was great, but the assistant to the waiter came over at the end of our meal about 3 times asking us if we were finished and when we said no he just stood there looking at us like we just spoke greek. He clearly wanted us out of there.  Mallorca: I have no idea why you won't tap into the reviews here and use them to your benefit. You have gold here. People are telling you they want to go to your establishment if you'd only serve good food at reasonable prices. I don't think that's asking much.  I've now made 2 mistakes eating here. That won't happen again. Ever."}
{"text":"I love this place.  While fad restaurants come and go, Mallorca has been a staple of Pittsburgh Dining as long as I have been alive.  While their wine menu is perhaps a bit to heavily influenced by some of their more famous patrons, it is very good.  Only fools who like to drink grapes grown from vines grafted onto Missouri vines will need to first gripe about the lack of french wine on the list, but then you can educate them on the fact that there are no 'old growth' french vines due to a little thing called blackrot.  THE FOOD!!!!!!!!!  Here is where true Spanish cooking excels!  Expect to taste the flavor of the meat and vegetables; not a wealth of spices like a poorly trained Chef would.  I personally recommend the Mariscada Aijillo or any of the Mariscada really!  The Veal is also always a please, but I prefer my food to be crawling in the ocean a day or two before I eat it.  I have taken many people here and recommended it to many friends.  I have only heard one bad report from all of those individuals and the complainer happens to be someone who lives on Wendy's so I take her complaints with a grain of salt.    GREAT PLACE!  Thank you for squeezing me in with short notice this weekend!"}
{"text":"Try it out!  We stumbled upon this place while passing through the city on Labour Day, partially because everything else was closed and we also overheard it as a recommendation. Both of us were quite pleased with everything and would definitely recommend.   The service was SUPERB. The server was extremely knowledgeable about the dishes; everything from ingredients to how it is prepared. My friend ordered the steak  and to be honest it wasn't the best cut and was slightly dry, as well it didn't come with the gorgonzola as advertised however she was still pleased. I went with the sea bass and was delighted. Warning, they bring around a dessert tray at the end so if you don't plan on ordering dessert, don't look directly at it (we clearly broke down and ordered the gluten free coconut lime mango mousse concoction).   The only downside was that my friend is gluten free and all of the sauces contain flour so she couldn't have any with her steak. It's too bad they couldn't offer a substitute or make a GF one on the fly.  All in all we enjoyed our evening and would suggest to others."}
{"text":"Paella was good but definitely overpriced"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Mallorca fan. My whole family insists on going every time they're in town. The service is fantastic, the portions are hearty (I usually have enough left over for another meal), and the food is delicious. My favorite is the salmon and crab meat dish. One tip -- I like to go for Saturday lunch. The price is about half of what you'd pay at dinner, but you still get plenty of food."}
{"text":"I don't give out too many one-star reviews, but Mallorca earned this one.  I went with my family this past Saturday and we were treated to slightly rude, slighty indifferent service as well as tasteless food that did not match the description on the menu.  For example, the stuffed mushrooms contained shrimp and that was not clearly indicated on the menu.  Many people have shrimp allergies, so that is just plan unsafe.  Another example: my sister ordered what was described on the menu as grilled chicken with peanuts and raisins.  The dish came out covered in cheese.  Um, I thought the point of a menu was to describe the food that you can expect to eat.  Not so at Mallorca.  Also, my dish was entirely flavorless, and overpriced to boot.  I would NOT at all recommend eating here."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary one year. We remember the sangria being pretty good and the seafood was very excellent. The portions were generous and all in all was a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"The food sucks. They brought us bread that was stone cold. The entrees had too much salt and the service was average at best."}
{"text":"4.5  It was amazing food and actually for the price, not as bad as a lot of the reviews make it out to seem.  My taste buds were delighted!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the world, including in Italy. So many fab memories at Mallorca since I was 16!   Recently relocated to The Burgh and already have plans to celebrate a major business milestone here with my Mom. CANNOT wait. Stay tuned, because there will be photos. Don't disappoint me, Mallorca! Standards better be the same stellar quality.   Absolute Mallorca musts: garlic shrimp, saffron rice, stuffed lobster, hearts of palm salad, garlic chicken cutlets and lobster in cream sauce."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I had the duck my husband had the veal. They surprised us with a shot of almond liquor and chocolate cake for our anniversary. The service was impeccable. Definitely would recommend it and come here again."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional...like nothing I've ever experienced.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the food which was borderline inedible.  I honestly don't think that I would ever go back (even if I were offered a free meal)."}
{"text":"I just don't see it.  I've had multiple people recommend Mallorca to me, so I decided to give it a try.  Wrong decision.  The service is what I can only describe as a three ring circus where the roof of the tent is coming down.  I couldn't tell you who our server was (we were asked for orders by 3 different people) and things were flying on and off our table before we could even comprehend what happened.  Looking for a traditional Spanish baseline, I decided on the Paella.  What was served can only be described as Uncle Ben's Paella mix from a stale box with the most minuscule and overcooked cuts of meat and seafood that can be found.  Add in the high prices and regardless of the massive portion sizes, this is definitely a one and done."}
{"text":"First, the pros: * They take reservations * There is convenient valet parking ($5, plus tip) * The shrimp in garlic sauce is quite nice * Our server recommended a $40 bottle of red wine that was quite nice  And the cons? * Paella: bland * Lobster: thoroughly overcooked, tough, rubbery * Starter salad: uninspired * Potato chips as a standard side: bland, unsalted, meh * Service: very, very strange. One gentleman insisted on rolling his r's in an exaggerated way (\"look how very Spanish I am!\"), as my friends and I fought to keep straight faces. Halfway through the evening, he forgot to keep up the pretense and used normal r's. Another gentleman seemed scattered; he asked the same questions (\"Did you like the sangria? Do you want red wine or white?\") multiple times. * Tables: We were in one of the three \"rooms\" that the restaurant has. The tables were placed so close together that we watched servers bump into each other. And yet, the front of the house was totally empty--no one at the bar or at the tables.  One bottle of wine, three entrées and one soup cost us $145 before tip. We left $30 (20%) and headed out. We will not be back."}
{"text":"absolutely excellent!!! by far my new favorite restaurant. the service was superb; all staff being involved in our visit, the atmosphere made me feel like I was on vacation. my salmon was cooked to perfection, as well as my boyfriend's filet. the sides were wonderfully portioned, they brought our first set of sides to share, which was plenty already, then asked if we would like more so they came out hot rather than sitting at the table with an abundance of food turning cold before even touched! love this place we will be back again and again"}
{"text":"Used to be good and also used to be a unique dining experience.  Food not bad but not excellent.  Hard to figure out who to tip!  Better for lunch than dinner in the Summertime."}
{"text":"Shame on me, my mother taught me never to judge a book by it's cover.  When we first stopped in, I have to admit I was a bit turned off by the decor.  It felt a little old and  dated.  I'm glad we stayed.  First and foremost, they had the best service in distant memory.  I mean that sincerely.  My drink was never half empty, they were always attentive without being obtrusive.  Specials, wow did they have a lot.  We ordered a Portuguese sausage flambed on open flame at the table.  Great show.   By the way, if I fail to mention it, portion sizes are massive.  There was a great wild boar special (i'm a sucker for wild boar).  The meat fell off the bone.  My wife had the lobster tail in cream sauce special.  It was so rich that we didn't finish it.  Reasonably priced for the quality of meal.  Will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"YUM! Me and my boyfriends mother went for lunch. We had the stuffed mushrooms, baked clams, and shrimp cocktail to start. It was all amazing, the baked clams were my favorite! She had the stuffed flounder, which was more like a giant seafood ball wrapped in flounder, VERY tasty! I had something that I can't pronounce! Starts like, Mari....I don't know the rest of how to spell it but it had scallops, half of a Maine lobster tail, clams, mussels, and shrimp. It was a little over cooked but good none the less. This is the second time I've been there and service has been impeccable each time! Can't wait to go back, I'll be making the boyfriend take me back for a dinner date next time ;)"}
{"text":"Very nice infact I come from Washington D.C. Where  Tapas bars crowd the scene it was my very 1st time trying Spanish food so it was very nice for me and my buddy yes it's overpriced but it's worth it  Most Spanish resturants are so now a days We ate outside and our waiter was an awsome one  I had a roasted goat and my buddy had a filet mignon with baby shrimp and I also had garlic soup now the garlic soup was okay but I tell you it inspired me to make my own at home and I will tell you mine is better! but as far as having the chivon it was awsome and we also had frangelico as a after lunch desert drink!  Very nice Expirence for out of towners such as myself and Pittsburghers alike ya can't go wrong with this resturant!"}
{"text":"Loved Mallorca. The food is AMAZING! Cannot go wrong with it. The service was good and there are so many specials.  I got paella and loved it. I also had leftovers for 3 days, too. The place is pretty dressy and would recommend that you look nice. It gets very crowded and you NEED reservations to get seated.   Go here for Spanish/Portuguese food and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Althought the portion sizes are huge...it's a waste of food.  My dinner was dry as if it had been prepared several hours in advance and then reheated once it was served to me.  Even though we were two of the only people at the resturant, we were still set way in the back by the kitchen. What gives?  I was left with nothing but disappointment from my trip to Mallorcas.   Prehaps I just went on a bad night.  I had the paella it was dry and flavorless and paella is one of my favorite dishes.   I went to Mallorca's for my birthday dinner and was completely let down.  I  didn't even take the left overs home, of which there was plenty   My boyfriend enjoyed the Sangria but the waiter took it away, even though the pitcher still enough left for one more glass.  Grumble...Mallorca I don't like you."}
{"text":"Always have received great service at Mallorca. Paella at its best. Many other Spanish style cuisine is offered on the expansive menu. But wait, its the daily specials that add even more to your decision making when selecting an entree! There is so much to consider, but if your not in the mood for the Paella, order a special.   This visit, the lobster was calling my name. So it was ordered. It was good, not the best I've had, but good none the less. Ask for the waiter to plate it for you to keep yourself from creating a mess. Paella was ordered by my son, who of coursed loved this featured staple here. The Portuguese steak and Osso Buco where the other selections in our party. Both were good, not fabulous, but just good.  Our appys consisted of the Portuguese sausage which comes \"flaming\" hot to your table, It was just OK, but really cool to watch as it cooks and is served table side. The octopus and stuffed seafood rellenos were just OK.   We enjoyed our dinner and was satisfied with our meal. If someone is in the mood for Spanish cuisine and wants great service, go here and choose the Paella. If you have a Groupon or it is Restaurant Week, this may be a viable option. If not, there are so many other places to explore in the Burgh with better food. Just my opinion.  Also, there is valet parking available in lot next door for those who may be concerned with the Southside parking issues."}
{"text":"Upon entering the dining area, my first impression was not overly positive. The room was crowded, and the tables were too close together; this created a hectic atmosphere which was not very pleasant for dinner. Most people were wearing fairly fancy clothing up to and including full suits.  The waiter tried to push drinks on us fairly heavily and then proceeded to go over the ridiculously long list of \"daily specials.\" I've never heard a specials list as long as the one here - it must have taken the waiter at least a half an hour to memorize it. Note that I don't view this as a positive aspect - while it's great to have specials, having this many is a sign that something is amiss. We decided to just go for the menu.  The bread they provided as an appetizer was excellent, although strangely the butter was served in little packets rather than just in a butter dish. The appetizer salads which came as part of the entrées were basically inedible because they drenched them with so much salad dressing. I got the mixed seafood in green sauce, and while it was decent, I felt that the sauce was too salty and overpowering. My dinner partner's dish was similarly salty and not too exciting. The mixed vegetables which came out were also overdone, and too drenched in some sort of sauce.  Overall, the best part of the meal was the bread which is kind of sad. The other food wasn't necessarily bad, it just wasn't very good. My overall impression of the place was that they were trying just a little too hard, but not quite making it. Certainly for the price, I don't think it's worth it."}
{"text":"We had the roasted pork (their specialty) at lunch time besides some tapas. The pork was very juicy inside and toasted outside (which is perfect!). Tapas was divine, very authentic Spanish food. Just the price is steep for the portion size. It's worth a try though."}
{"text":"Went on the suggestion of a friend we were visiting. My wife and I both had different flavors of the mariscado, which was tasty. A little loud at first (mostly due to a large birthday party group at a nearby table), it quieted down later. In all, a good introduction to Spanish cuisine."}
{"text":"Got served the same rack of lamb(raw)three times. The waiter was courteous, but that doesn't help everything we got was wrong and/or burned or raw. This was not the first bad experience at this establishment, never again. You can get REAL Spanish food(which is top notch)  in Shadyside."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my seafood platter which featured half of a very large lobster. My wife enjoyed the roast duck. I chose the gazpacho which was delicious. They have a truly professional wait staff in the finest of European traditions. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Let's be real - this is the fancy place on the Southside! I've been here several times for birthdays, anniversaries, and other special occasions. It's always been a good experience!  My most recent trip we sat at the bar for the first time and had a great experience. The bartender, Jay, was super friendly and attentive. We ordered the garbanzo beans, the cheese & fruit plate, and the crispy potatoes. All great choices for tapas! (The potatoes actually aren't crispy, but they are still good!) A pitcher of sangria and the rum cake made for a full meal (we were stuffed with this amount of food!)  Here are my tips:  Must have: Red Sangria! The pitcher is our go-to and really is delicious!  Consider: My favorite meal is the chicken cannelloni, the Spanish rice & veggies (that come with every entree) is great! Dessert: you can't go wrong - but I never have room for it! Tapas: the cheese and fruit plate is sizeable, be sure you have enough people to tackle it!  The patio is lovely - even through the fall it's a great outdoor area for dinner! They have the patio, a few areas of dining rooms, and the front bar area - so all people can find a place to please them!  At the end of every meal they give you a shot of almond liquor - enjoy!   For those out-of-towers (aka not walking through the SS), remember that they have free Valet Parking (so bring your cash for a tip)."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week summer 17 and had a delightful experience. Octopus entree was FABULOUS. Stuffed salmon with crab was also delicious. Will be back for sure. I heard their paella is a must try so I'll update my review once I try that dish."}
{"text":"Good food with superb services and good atmosphere! Solid seafood entree of big portion size. Their sangria pitcher rocks ($25)!!! Yummy dessert at good price. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Used to love coming here when I lived in Pittsburgh - great food, nice environment - paella, garlic shrimp - all of the spanish classics were great.  Haven't been here in some time - hope it is still as good as I remember.  Was a huge fan of the South Side in general - great festivals, bars, restaurants, german/polish restaurants, fun one-off shops, bakeries, great place to walk around, etc...  Last time I was back , it seemed to be a tale of two worlds on the South Side - some of the one-off local business looked like they were gone or suffering, and there was new development with retail chains that probably brought some new investment, but was a different character.  Was fairly early on a Saturday morning, so perhaps I did not see things as they typically are here - nonetheless , memories of a very good restaurant and the South Side/Carson Street."}
{"text":"From the moment you enter, you are treated as a guest,  not a customer.  The staff is very welcoming without being effusive.  The food options  on the special restaurant week menu are limited but there's something there for every taste,  We have been to two of these events at Mallorca and both times,  our expectations were more than met  The food was outstanding.  This time my husband had the Boar Shank and it literally melted in your mouth.  He didn't even have to use a knife!  I had the Paella - and they made it without muscles since I don't care for them. They want you to like their food and enjoy the experience and therefore, are very accommodating without making you feel like it's an imposition!  We  have eaten there at other times and the regular menu offers a lot!  We have never ordered anything that we didn't rave abut afterwards.  (By the way, the gazpacho is the best I've ever had anywhere!)  Portions are quite large so we always take some home for lunch the next day! My husband just declared Mallorca to be his favorite restaurant and I can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for a true ethnic-style dinner.  Everything is authentic with extreme attention to detail with their service, their food presentation and their quality.  It's quite obvious that it is a family-owned as they take personal pride in their restaurant.  We had a party of 7 and each person ordered a different entree.  EVERY person loved their food.  Stuffed filet, blackened ribeye, lobster ravioli, lamb, paella, whole fish (can't remember what it was called), etc.  Presentation was fabulous.  Don't forget dessert -- and especially the Spanish coffee.  A bit pricey, but I blame that on the 3 bottles of wine we ordered and all the appetizers !  We will definitely go back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is really hands down the best restaurant in Pittsburgh for people looking for an upscale dining experience for a special occasion. Mallorca serves authentic Spanish dishes in huge portions and even though the meals are pricey, you are still getting A LOT of food for your money compared to other more expensive restaurants. For $35 I got TWO generously sized whole lobsters stuffed with crab and shrimp. The other guests in my party got Delmonico steaks topped with gorgonzola cheese and  mushrooms. The steaks were easily 12-15 oz. Everyone is served a salad to start and family style Spanish rice, vegetables, and Spanish potatoes (which are like homemade chips) with the entrees. As appetizers our table got the stuffed mushrooms and flambe Portuguese sausage which they bring to the table in a flaming cast iron pig shaped dish.   The waitstaff is also super attentive...quickly taking away dirty dishes, refilling water, and giving us more bread/butter all before we even notice we've even run low.   Amazing service, even more amazing food. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"Brought a lady friend of mine with me on my second run to Mallorca. She absolutely loved the place and was bragging to her coworkers the next day. The service was still top notch and food was delicious."}
{"text":"My latest trip to Mallorca was for a  good friend's birthday party. She had called the day of to make reservations and was able to get a table for 6. When I arrived, my husband and I were the first in our party. We were asked to wait in the small bar area for our entire party. This was rather annoying to me since the bar was righ by the entrance and other people kept coming in and bumping into us. The area was highly congested with the bar on one side, tables on teh other and a coat check a the end.  Not a good place to grab a relaxing drink before our meal. The drinks are fairly reasonably priced, $17 for two VERY large glasses of wine. Once our party arrived, we were seated. We decided to skip the appetizers and move right to the entrees knowing the portion sizes are large. The waiter read the 20+ specials, as usual. They must have the same specials for several days in a  row, otherwise no one would be able to remember all of those dishes. I ordered the filet and my husband ordered the paella. My filet was tender, juicy and cooked perfectly. As always, the table was served rice, veggies and chips family style as sides. The rice and chips were delicious but the veggies were a bit under done. The green beans were quite crispy, not in a good way. After dinner, we were trying to decide on dessert when our waitor, who had been short with us several times during our meal, heard that it was my friend's birthday and decided to bring the entire table chocolate cake. What a sweet gesture! :) I gave Mallorca 3 stars because a few hours after dinner, my husband started to not feel well. He had a bad headache and slept for 10 hours which is highly unusual for him. I also woke up with a headache which I think had something to do with their house wine, which was the only wine they had by the glass. I  never have headaches from wine, especially when I only have one glass. Next time, I will order a bottle."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The staff is amazing.  The menu has both a standard set, and multiple daily specials.  The sangria Blanca alone is worth the trip."}
{"text":"We have dined here many times. Tonight will be the last. So disappointed. We were seated in a 3x4 foot table almost on top of the couple next to us. Felt like cafeteria style dining even though we paid 75 for one entree. Service was just ok."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Mallorca for several years. We went back last night, a very slow winter Monday. The place was nearly empty , so we didn't experience the noisy, crowded place that you get on the weekend. The waiter didn't have to shout out the numerous dairy specials and we could actually have a reasonable conversation. We ordered the paella and chicken Mallorca, both of which were very good. The portions are huge and in addition they bring house made potato chips and steamed vegetables and bread. We took enough leftovers home for another dinner. The wine list was much improved from our last visit, with a good selection of domestic and imported varieties at reasonable prices. Deserts were the flan and creme brûlée, and although we consumed them both completely they were not notable. We did enjoy the complementary almond liquor. Service, obviously aided by the low turnout, was perfect. The menu is diverse and supplemented by numerous daily specials, so there is something for everyone, but if you need potatoes or are vegan you probably should stay away. Prices are reasonable, given the quality and large portion sizes. Overall it's a pretty legitimate Spanish/European restaurant, at least by Pittsburgh stands."}
{"text":"We held our rehearsal dinner here last year and couldn't have been happier.  We returned this year to celebrate our first anniversary.  The wine list is exceptional and the service even better.  I had the veal osso bucco and my husband had a 3lb lobster stuffed with crab. They remembered us from last year and gave us complimentary dessert for our special occasion."}
{"text":"My neighbor and I visited this establishment on Thursday of \"Pittsburgh Restaurant Week\".  I was impressed by the service I received from the wait staff. They all worked together to ensure we were always taken care of. You felt like you had four different waiters all at the same time.   For an entree I had the wild boar. This was a first for me and I was really impressed with the flavor and technique used to cook the wild boar.   Portions were large and I even think they added food to my to go box to make sure it was full when I left.   I would recommend this place in the future."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurants many time 20 years ago. Why? Because I like Spanish food and I have to say that food and service quality is high. It is too bad to see one or two stars in some of the reviews.  We came back to see how they are doing. So first time in 20 years, we are coming back. They did meet our expectation. Quality food and quality service.  First time visit, you should order Paella. This is a must. You can order one or two serving for four. Then order, two appetizer. Recommend seafood based appetizer (stuffed squid, sautéed octopus, etc). If you get two to three main dish, this will be plenty to chow.   I like the Paella. You can taste the flavor of variety of seafood and chicken. It is absolutely good. If you are visiting Pittsburgh, highly recommended. If you do not have a car, cab can take you from downtown in 10 min."}
{"text":"Come for the 4 different types of sangria and stay for the authentic Spanish cuisine.  Each dish from the chorizo appetizer to the Langosta Relleno are fantastic and presented in with true style.  Sitting inside is nice if not a little uptight but the relaxed comfort of the patio is the best. Come hungry as portions are generous"}
{"text":"BIG BIG portions very good . I had the stuffed lobster tail holy tails . HUGE . wine list unreal . All the sides are big to stuffed calamari was really good too . Been going here for 15 years still on point !!!"}
{"text":"The building may be old, but there's more character in the food than meets the eye.  About as original you can get from mainland Spain... a real treat. There's two divisions to the place, the left side is more chill & private. Wonderful food & the staff love their jobs!  Excellent shrimp."}
{"text":"Having lived in Madrid, I was ecstatic to try this Spanish restaurant from the fabulous reviews of my friends. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. The service crew was very attentive as well as charming and the food was perfect. I had a glass of the house sangria with my mariscos in verde sauce and left full and happy. The servings are quite large, and we had leftovers for a few days--but I was happy to eat that food again! I recommend calling ahead and reserving a table on the patio, weather permitting. It was a gorgeous night when I went but I wished that I had requested patio seating ahead of time, as it was not available by the time we came for our reservation.  Overall, fantastic Spanish cuisine for every palette."}
{"text":"A dining experience at Mallorca is akin to the grand display of pageantry from the dining scene of Beauty and the Beast: things are lit on fire, waiters can ramble off twenty different specials off the top of their head, four or five different waiters and staff cater to you throughout your dining experience, and the evening is finished off with shots of Amarguinha.  There's no doubt about it, much of Mallorca's appeal stems from the incredible five-star service. My family and I had a rough time picking a special occasion restaurant and ended up here. With mixed reviews around the table, I would certainly recommend that people look past the few shoddy reviews and give it a shot for themselves. It's been around for about twenty years and is most certainly a Pittsburgh destination.  We started off with a pitcher of sangria (excellent) and an order of peppers stuffed with seafood and cheeses (also good). As for entrees, I ordered the paella and was rather disappointed. It came with chicken, scallops, shrimp, langostinos,  clams, sausage, and mussels. Touted as a house specialty, the whole dish was rather dry and I found that it was not as infused with the saffron flavor that I am used to from other places.   My mom ordered the soft shell crab special and here's where Mallorca picks up a few points. This dish is literally my mom's favorite food and she said these were the best she has ever had in her life. I'm used to the paltry, tiny crabs but this dish was served with three HUGE crabs cooked in a wine and butter sauce that was to die for. Although I'm not normally a big fan of soft shell crabs, these were absolutely phenomenal. My dad ordered the veal Marsala and it was decent. Every entree is served with platters of vegetables and saffron rice. Overall, the portion sizes are humongous.  For dessert, I ordered a piece of the almond cake and this was absolutely delicious. The cake was light and fluffy and the almond creme was to die for. To top off the meal, the servers bring out complimentary shots of Amarguinha (a Portuguese almond liqueur), which I thought was a delightful touch.   Overall, I will definitely be back to try more on this menu. I'll be staying away from the paella and veering more towards their seafood dishes, which I highly recommend to anyone considering an evening at Mallorca."}
{"text":"Service is quite nice especially the younger male waiter (not sure his name). The older waiter was still polite, but came off as a bit condescending. The food was really not impressive. The garlic shrimp was good. I had trout with seafood stuffing, which was very bland. My hubby had paella. Most things in the paella were nice, including two big scallops, numbers of shrimps and shellfish. But again it was quite bland. A half of small lobster and a mussels had a very strong oder. The waiter explained, and made us new pieces of lobster. But sadly, the new ones were as dry as chewing a rubber band. They also served us crazy amount of side dishes including fresh potato chips(which was good), very dry carrot or some sort of orange rice, and extremely oily vegetables.  I think in general, they have decent quality materials, but they really should hire a better chef. In addition, they may be able to save quite a bit of money by cutting down the amount of side dishes."}
{"text":"I'm going to break this review into positives and negatives.  Positives 1. Great selection of many different types of Spanish and Portuguese food. 2. Fresh food that is well prepared 3. Interesting building with neat, cozy seating 4. Fast, efficient, polite serves 5. Lots of specials 6. Great paella, on par with what I have had in Europe.  Negatives 1. A little dark 2. A bit pricy, but not so bad for the quality of food.  Overall, this place has become our go-to special occasion dinner place, especially because of the great variety."}
{"text":"Drinks -- I had water but my fiance had the red sangria which I tasted and it was pretty good Appetizer -- Mussels in Green sauce -- I found it very tasty, loved the broth Entree -- Twin lobster tails with some sort of brandy and a side of melted butter. They were OK - never thought I'd say that about lobster, but they really were bland after a few bites. I'm thinking overcooked.  Sides -- Came with vegetables (mostly brocolli/cauliflower which I ate), yellow rice (my fiance ate that) and potato chips - they looked OK but we didn't try them Dessert -- Didn't order any Service -- Friendly but not the most attentive. We dined on a Saturday night and the place was superbusy.  Deals/Discounts -- we used a Groupon..The deal was $12 for $25 worth of food, but because I bought my Groupon through my Iphone App for the first time, I got a $10 credit..ultimately $2 for $25  worth of food Overall -- only go on a slow night (not Saturday evening!) and if you have a Groupon or discount"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant many times. And I have to say they are one of the most consistent delivers of great food in Pittsburgh. The prices are reasonable and the portion size is always more than you would expect. Whether it's lunch or dinner you will be satisfied with the service and the food. Bon appétit."}
{"text":"Mallorca is my favorite restaurant. The main reason  is the service. It is superior in every way - from the maître d' to the busboys & unmatched anywhere. One gets the feeling they truly care about your dining pleasure.Our table of four arrived at our reservation time of 5:45 on the first night snow had fallen this winter. Thank goodness for the valet parking on this night. Our table was ready, and our snowy wet coats were taken and hung for us in front by the bar. Our pitcher of red sangria hit the spot as we listened to the list of specials and examined the menu. We started with an appetizer of Calamari Frito. It was a large portion, not greasy but a little chewy. The dipping sauce was light & pleasantly spicy. Dinner started w their usual salad dressed w the restaurant's thousand-island-like dressing. Prior to the main courses arrive, the table is cleared & all silverware is replaced with a clean set.  I had the Mariscada with garlic sauce. The pot full of shellfish - langoustine, a couple sea scallops, mussels, shrimp & clams - calls for more of the warm sourdough bread to dip  in the garlicky broth & is a steal at $27.95. My sister ordered one of the specials- beef Wellington. It was a beautiful cut & the meat fork tender & flavorful inside the flaky crust. My one daughter ordered   the crab- stuffed trout, Trucha Rellena, which arrived as an unexpectedly large portion of 2 trout. My other daughter was pleased with her order of large shrimp in a white sauce, Camerone Costa del Sol. The meals all come with family- style platters of rice&peas, steamed vegetable platter of cauliflower, broccoli, carrots & snow peas, and a small platter of homemade potato chips.  Throughout the meal the waitstaff was so attentive we felt as if we were the only customers in the restaurant. Dinner ends with a complementary half shot of almond flavored liqueur.  As usual, this was a wonderful dining experience and put us right in the mood for the Manheim Steamroller concert at the Benedum! It is not to be missed."}
{"text":"The paella was pretty good, defentaily had a nice variety of seafood plus a few meats. The best selection is the ostrich. Don't be scared it is delightful. The sangria is some of the best i've had.   If you just want to drink go next door to Ibiza (same owners) and hang out on the patio and get some tapas.  Have fun!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mallorca twice and both times I was satisfied. Its on the pricey side, but its well worth it. Nice place to celebrate a special occasion, like a birthday or anniversary."}
{"text":"Overrated.  Overpriced.  Didn't I say this for another restaurant?  Mallorca is often rated as the best in Pittsburgh, but dear Pittsburghers, this is a chain.  I came here with a friend, looking for a place to have a nice conversation.  Surprisingly, it was loud and busy.  We walked in without a reservation on a Saturday evening, but still got a table within 20 minutes.  I had the seafood paella along with two appetizers and dessert.  My share came out to be $49 including tax and tip.  The paella was huge (it actually lasted for four extra meals without going bad).  The spicy chorizo was somewhat too much for an appetizer.  The flan was moist and good.  Recommended for Spanish food, but the price and the accompanying noisy atmosphere doesn't get this establishment five stars."}
{"text":"This is a five star restaurant if I've ever been to one. I went with my cousin on the suggestion of a friend, and loved every second of the experience. We started off with one of the best Sangrias I've ever had. The bartender's attention to detail was second to none. Our appetizer was calamari with a nice spicy sauce. Amazing taste and the sauce was very flavorful. The next course I had was a garlic soup with eggs and croutons. I'd never had garlic soup, so I didn't know what to expect. I liked it so much, it will be a go to whenever I come back. If I could give you an idea, it has a tingly bitterness to it that feels so good on your tongue. We then moved onto the entree, which for me was pork chops with yellow rice and for my cousin was a cheese ravioli. Now, pork is a particular kind of meat, and has to be made immaculately for me to fall in love with it. Mallorca passed the test. It melted in my mouth and the sauce used on it was amazing. The same good things can be said for the bit of ravioli my cousin had me taste because she said, \"You have to try this VJ (my nickname). It's so good.\" For dessert I had a caramel cheesecake, and loved it. It will be a go to dessert for now on when I go back. Our server was courteous and prompt. He earned his tip, and I made sure it was 20% for very good service. The cherry on top were the complimentary Amarguinha shots they gave us at the end. Final verdict is go here and go here now. Everything about this place is excellent from the food to the staff. Make it a lovely evening or afternoon. But, go at least once and you'll want to go back often."}
{"text":"So first of all, let me preface this by saying, I always have a good time in Pittsburgh. It's just like magic. I show up, I have a great time, and I owe it all to the Steel City's... I dunno... jeu ne se quois?! So, the best of times are when I find something ELSE that I love as much as Pittsburgh in the city of bridges. Found: Mallorca.  Spanish culture, language, food, music and I, well we get along well.  I was super excited to find a Groupon for Mallorca, as it is a classy little spot, but a bit out of my normal price range for a casual Saturday night out. I don't know if it was subliminal messaging or sentiment remaining from my vacation in Spain, but I was a woman on a mission: Sangria, Paella. End of sentence. Mallorca is a white table cloth place, and they take your coat at the door-- keepin' it classy. We ordered a pitcher of Sangria and shared the house Paella. I wasn't dazzled by the shared dish charge, but we just weren't hungry enough to put down much more than the Paella dish alone.  I can't say the food was so authentic it took me right back to the streets of Las Ramblas where I had my first authentic Paella, but it was good, and far better than what I have seen turned out by zealous would-be chefs that I call friends. There was plenty of flavor, and the seafood was cooked well. The dish was accompanied by some steamed veggies, and you'd think it's hard to mess up steamed veggies, but my friends I have seen it done and Mallorca did not disappoint.  I saw a lot of what looked like special celebrations and romantic, intimate dates happening all around us, and I thought that was charming. The service would get five stars if it stood on it's own, and although we passed on dessert, the selections looked enticing.  If you get a chance to go to Mallorca, I recommend going all out. My next trip will be more of a three-course experience."}
{"text":"Awesome Spanish place on the South Side, Mallorca scores high with its authentic fare and reasonable prices. A great date place."}
{"text":"I'm preeeetttty sure people think I'm a food critic. The irony, I know. When I travel for work, I dine alone, and am often a little dressy. I ask for the waiters' recommendations. So, I sometimes get some free food. This may have been the case at Mallorca. If not, I can say with full assurance that you will eat like a king!  I ordered one of the fish specials and got, like, 4 sides. The servers are attentive but, omigod, there are like, 25 of them. The food was good. Not amazing, but good. At the end of meal, I enjoyed a spanish ouzo (?) compliments of the chef.   The pluses: the atmosphere, the service. You'll feel like a fancy lady. The food was decent - good"}
{"text":"Simply awesome dining experience. A great example of just doing everything right. Excellent service, superb fresh ingredients and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went there recently on a warm summer evening. The outside seating area is very pleasant. Service was very attentive. However, the food was only average; the paella was somewhat bland. roasted sweet peppers, stuffed mushrooms).Given the cost, even with a Groupon, this was disappointing."}
{"text":"My family and friends have been eating at this fabulous restaurant for over 20 years. Celebrating any and all occasions, romantic dinners or a drink at the bar. The Spanish/Portugese theme, the very attentative Portugese waiter (not sure of the dialogue) explaining the specials. Greatest wine we drank and delicious sangria. Our water glasses were never empty, our table cleaned of dishes and silverware between each course. Our party enjoyed steak (large and tender), lobster (plenty of meat), stuffed lobster tails (unbelievable) and the best dish, blackened swordfish. When you hear the many unique choices, you want to have all of them. I've tried over the years. I think this restaurant is the best in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"The only reason I have given two stars is because my wife enjoyed her meal. Mine, however, was awful.  Drink: gin and tonic with a lime and a fly Appetizer: clams in green sauce. Unbelievably salty.  Main: Paella. I was excited for this. Unfortunately, it was so dry it was hard to eat without sipping water. Not alot of flavor. Seafood and chicken was so overcooked it was either gummy or rock solid. I would have sent it back, but it took 20 mins to get it the first time.  Service: completely hit or miss  Overall: I won't ever go back. Worst way to spend $100 in the city. Very disappointed.  UPDATE: After a fortuitous encounter with Micah Rosa, who manages Mallorca's online advertisement/identity, I was given a gift card for a revisit. I have given Mallorca one more star. I am grateful for the hospitality. I thought the service was great this time around. No flies in my drinks. No waiting for overcooked food. IN FACT, the fish I had was perfectly cooked, as was my wife's steak. This restaurant just isn't for me, however. The food just isn't on par with the price. Quantities are outrageous, so it is hard to go home hungry, but I get can full anywhere."}
{"text":"Simply the best. My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh for a reason. Every time I come here they do a fantastic job and the service is on point.  I highly recommend Mallorca."}
{"text":"Langosta Rellena Broiled Stuffed Lobster with Crab Meat and Shrimp $34.95  \"Your gonna need a bigger boat\"  A huge fresh lobster broiled and filled with Shrimp and crabmeat stuffing."}
{"text":"Too salty, bland. Nothing special. I wonder if the mixed vegetables were heated up from a Giant Eagle frozen mixed veggie bag. Not fresh. Chips? Seriously?! Cut down the insane amount of food and just make it tasty, healthy and good. Uncomfortable seating - cramped with waiters constantly swarming around you. If you like the attention and average food maybe this is ok for you. One positive, and it's big- no smoking on the outdoor patio. Now that's something they got right. Ok, one more- cute looking bar area."}
{"text":"Dinned with wife and kids (12 and 10) 6 PM on Friday.  Had a great meal.  Great Service!  Was getting tired of our usually family/kid restaurants and decided to take the family out for a nicer dinning experience.  My son wants to return each month :)  A little too pricey for that, but a great treat every once in a while.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Mallorca seems to be a restaurant which has rested on its laurels. I'm guessing it was once amazing, maybe even the best restaurant in the Burgh. Today they seem to have gotten lazy. Pre-cooked rice and bland paella. Did I set my hopes too high? Maybe. But if price is any indication of quality, I think I should at least expect fresh rice. My wife loved it....I would have rather gone to Mike & Tony's down the road. I'd be willing to give it a second chance...but only if my wife pays. Head waiter seemed lmore interested in the girls walking on the sidewalk than our table. Not a good sign."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight. I had the Crab-Stuffed Lobster, and my fiancé had the osso bucco. My food was pretty good -- the lobster was a little chewy and the crabmeat was more shreds than chunks, but it was still pretty tasty. His osso bucco, however, was out of this world.  We also shared the clams casino, which I highly recommend.   The restaurant was definitely more alive outside on a summer night than inside. You could watch people go by on the street and it was nice. Just right.  Service was very attentive and pleasant and upbeat. We had to wait a little before ordering, but after that there was no lull at all. They refilled glasses and took away played at just the right pace. It was really great service.  Overall, I think the lobster could have used some work, but it was a pleasant and rather luxurious experience. I'm glad we came here. I'll be back."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant with very generous portion sizing.  We had the garlic shrimp and Portuguese sausage as appetizers. Chicken breast in a cheese sauce and shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce as entrees.  We both got the chocolate cake as dessert.  It was all very delicious!  Wait staff were very friendly and open.  We went for restaurant week, but would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I took my sister Violet here for her birthday. We had a wonderful time. For an appetizer we got the seafood stuffed mushrooms which come with a delicious garlic sauce which we sopped up with some of the yummy bread! For entree we both got the garlic shrimp and boy were we pleased! They gave us a bounty of shrimp, around 40 per serving! The garlic spicy sauce is just perfect for the shrimp. The meal came with Spanish rice, steamed veggies, and house baked potato chips! The service was impeccable. We are already planning to go back this month (August) for my birthday!"}
{"text":"Our school treated us to a dinner here to celebrate the end of semester. It was a great choice and we had so much food! The service was quick (dinner on thurs, with 20+ people) , sangria, wine, and bread were at the table before we even sat down. Then the appetizers started coming out, my favorites were garlic shrimp and spanish sausage. The green pepper one was ok but a good choice for vegetarians.   Then came the main course accompanied a house salad with a nice, spicy dressing. We had some choices: pasta, fish, steak, veggie + sides of saffron rice and chips. I went with the steak, it was HUGE and topped with cheese and mushrooms. I got it medium-rare, it was nice and juicy, maybe the fat could've been trimmed some more.  For dessert, I had rum cake and coffee and some odd tasting sweet liquor. They have valet parking and a small parking lot next to the restaurant, pretty convenient. Great restaurant overall, I'm curious to try the paella to see how it compares to SF"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was hesitant - the reviews online were mixed and I've not had great luck finding authentic food in the area. I was pleasantly mistaken. Mallorca was fabulous! As a group, we had Paella, Camarones Costa Del Sol, Camarones Enchilados and Monkfish Enchilado plus two appetizers: the Chorizo and Chipirones (baby calamari stuffed with prosciutto). Spanish rice and thick potato chips accompanied everything (except the paella of course). The shrimp were cooked perfectly. The enchilado sauce was wonderful - a rich tomato base with nice spice.  The head waiter had a great poker face but was a lot of fun. Somehow he managed to get through the lengthy list of specials from memory. He was very knowledgeable about all the dishes and was happy to answer all our questions. There was so much on the menu we didn't get a chance to try - we're definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sangria, great food. Wonderful service to boot!  I had a long dinner here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday and my brother's college graduation. We had a few appetizers, I had a wonderful pasta dish, some fantastic chocolate desert. A few bottles of great Spanish and Chilean wines too. And since it was my mom's birthday - there also appeared to be a birthday at every table that night - they brought her a HUGE piece of cake and Amaretto shots for the table. A very wonderful night out!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had in pittsburgh. The food is superb, the service Is fantastic, and the atmosphere is great. Highly recommend making a reservation and accommodates large parties. You will not be disappointed. Try the sangria pitchers - out of this world! Daily specials with fresh fish and other meats. Save room for dessert and cappuccino!"}
{"text":"As part of the 2015 Pittsburgh Restaurant week we chose Mallorca. There are so many new spots to eat in this area but you won't find a spot with this much class. Be sure to sit outside this summer! The experience that we had at Mallorca tonight was nothing short of perfection. Every dish and drink that came out was served with great care. The service was great. I can honestly say that I have not had a better experience at any restaurant in Pittsburgh!  We were treated like royalty...seriously, I'm so happy about the experience tonight!  Items we tried were all perfectly delicious.   Filet served in a cream sauce Crab stuffed mushrooms Mussels in tomato sauce Garlic Shrimp Flan Chocolate.cake Veal in cream sauce Stuffed salmon  Make sure to try the white sangria. It was the perfect edition to a great dinner, outside, on a cool Pittsburgh evening.  The owner gave us a drink on the house before we wrapped up our evening and I chose an almond liquor shot. Amazing dessert!"}
{"text":"Mallorca has been my family's go-to place for special occasions for YEARS.  It's the only place I know where I can get a broiled lobster stuffed with crab meat alongside a cauldron of sea creatures for under $50 *and* have a very satisfying lunch for the next day.  They specialize in cooking enormous portion sizes with expertise.  Once I ordered a prime rib and they brought out this two-inch monstrosity with two rib bones sticking out the side.  It had a beautiful broiled crust, perfectly medium, tender, tasty and was probably mooing that morning.  Nearly all of the meals I've had here have been great and those that weren't more most likely because I was experimenting and discovered that I didn't like the dish, not that it was prepared improperly.  As for atmosphere, it's dark, tight, and only semi-romantic because it's always crowded and the walkways are narrow.  Personally, I love it because it's always an experience:  the waiters chattering in Portuguese, romancing the patrons or bringing out eye-popping food that's either oversized, on fire or smelling really good.  Definitely check it out with a date, bust out a couple Benjamins and enjoy yourself (oh, and write a review - we Yelpers would love to see what you think)."}
{"text":"While Mallorca always gets high ratings in Pgh Magazine, my dissatisfaction with it has grown over the years. Its biggest attraction seems to be the size of its portions, and the food is hardly authentic. Last year a group of 10 went there for a birthday dinner. Our server recited a huge list of \"specials,\" which always seems to be the same items every time I go. Our food eventually arrived overcooked, and one member had his meal sent back. In fact, only one or two of us were satisfied with the food. I finally said \"Enough.\" Have not returned and don't intend to."}
{"text":"I would say more like four and a half stars.  The first time I went I thought it was kind of an odd atmosphere.  A bunch of grim looking dudes in suits politely but seriously escorting you to your table.  I now realize that these are all super sweet dudes that are incredibly nice, and they run one of the best restaurants in the South Side.  I have heard many people describe the place as too expensive, but really for both the quality and the amount of food you get, it really is very reasonably priced.  The waitstaff is great, and even when it's packed, they never appear to be in a frenzy of activity.  The sangria is a good plan.  I keep meaning to spend an evening here and just order pitcher after pitcher.  The seafood is very good, and always listen for the specials, because the chefs really have some unique ideas usually.  Too bad I've already locked on to the camarones enchilados."}
{"text":"Service was great. We had multiple servers during our meal, but they all were incredibly attentive. Courses were well spaced and plentiful. I regretted ordering one of the fish specials, but only because I was a bit jealous of what my companions had ordered (the paella especially)."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very noisy. Cramped. The whole lobster is good but I recommend you allow the employees to crack it for you. The sangria is to die for. My favorite. Ibiza- the tapas next door is also very good."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Mallorca in a few years. It wasn't that I didn't like it anymore, it was that my wife and I don't get dressed up and go out like we used to. Plus, I was worried that Mallorca might have been slipping- I was used to a quality Spanish restaurant with overattentive service, delicious food, and a romantic ambiance. However, it seems like every other day, there is a new Groupon or half-off deal for Mallorca, which was giving me a red flag that something was wrong.  A recent visit proved me wrong. The food is just as good, the portions are huge, and the European class is still there.  If you've never been to Mallorca, part of the charm of this restaurant are the different rooms. Each room has a different decor, with lots of woods, colorful tiles, drapes, interesting stained-glass, and tablecloths and linens. The best way to describe the service is that everyone in the restaurant is like the butler from Mr. Deeds (I'm very, very sneaky). They have intoxicating accents, are dressed in formal wear, and usually swoop in two or three at a time to set tables, serve drinks, and place your food. If you're not ready for it, it can seem jarring, but at Mallorca it's all part of the Spanish charm. As for the food, the Spanish cuisine can't be beat in Pittsburgh. Here, Spanish doesn't mean tacos and burritos, but continental cuisine like fresh seafood, veal, and steaks, and they have a laundry list of specials like suckling pig, roasted duck, lamb, and other exotic dishes that they read off in a thick Spanish accent that is a show in itself. Each entree comes with bread, salad, rice, vegetables, and homemade chips- you will not go hungry at Mallorca. My favorite apps are their calamari or roasted sausage, which comes on a sizzling plate. For dinner, I enjoy the paella, which is filled with seasoned rice, scallops, shrimp, chorizo, clams, mussels, chicken, and a bunch of other stuff that tastes really good together. It comes in a giant steamer pot, so be prepared to take some home. My wife defaults to the Mariscada En Salsa Verde, which is a bunch of seafood cooked in a yummy green sauce. For dessert, we like their flan, although we rarely make it to dessert with all the food we end up taking home. Also, make sure you wash it all down with their homemade sangria, which is thick with alcohol and chunks of fruit, or check out their extensive wine list.  Mallorca is a great place for a romantic dinner, celebration, or if you just like good Spanish continental cuisine and rolling R's.."}
{"text":"We went here after my daughter graduated from college. Party of 10 and they absolutely nailed it all around. The service was great, the food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"The paella was really good. Cost of food was higher than most places but worth it. Got to speak Spanish with the waiters, which was a plus. Good environment."}
{"text":"I took my then girlfriend here to celebrate 3 months together, and man is this place nice.  She has a lot of dietary restrictions, so Manuel met with me to customize our own menu for the evening.  Manuel insisted on cooking for us- the swordfish and salmon were cooked to perfection!!!  Our appetizers were great, and we ordered a pineapple sorbet and watermelon sorbet for dessert.  Everything was delicious, neither of us got sick, and by the end of the night she became my fiancée!  What a great memory!  Highly recommend this restaurant because of the quality, service, and personalized attention."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting, I don't know if I have a taste for this restaurant.   After 10 minutes, 20 dollars later, and 5 different waiters, my Vegetarian Paella came out.  A variety of different vegetables that you'd find in the frozen food section in the grocery store thrown onto a bed of rice.   I just wish they had a more creative approach to the dish or even had a twinge of flavor.  The only plus to this restaurant was that it gave an abundance of food (along with our entree we got, bread, salad, steamed vegetables,homemade chips, and rice)."}
{"text":"Late lunch, began with pumpkin bisque, served hot with wonderful chewy bread on a cold rainy day paired well with Fuzelo Vinho Verde, a crisp house Portuguese white at 11%. Bar service was prompt and attentive.  After a leisurely passage of time in the old -world South side Pitts ambiance, the tapas and another glass were presented: Pulpo a la Gallega (potatoes and octopus) and, Piquillos Rellenos (peppers stuffed with raisins and nuts). Hey, I wanted to try something different: which leads me to my only \"issue.\" Although the dishes were expertly prepared and wonderful (although this was my last attempt at trying to like octopus), I would have liked to have tried more: seafood stuffed mushrooms, pickled anchovies, etc. but the portion was huge! I was lucky to finish the two tapas I ordered! tapas in Spain are sold one at a time, the idea being to try a variety, not stuff yourself with just a couple! Maybe things are different in Portugal...  Regardless, I could not refuse Flan, which came with a nice scoop of caramel on the side. Very well done!"}
{"text":"Eating the melt-in-your-mouth Chilean Sea bass and the traditional Valencia paella (mild) in the outdoor courtyard was wonderful.  The monk fish was very fresh and the branzino was flaky and tender.  The anchovy appetizer was by far the best I've eaten in the United States. The red Sangria was refreshing and the wine selection was good.  Friendly waiters topped off our evening."}
{"text":"Great time with great friends celebrating a birthday. Food and service is top notch here!"}
{"text":"Thought I reviewed this before.  Went tonight for the 3rd time.  Otherwise haven't in over a year.  It's a Spanish restaurant with pallela.  They also have Chicken Marsala and varous veal dishes and many seafood options.  You can even get steak and prime rib.  The steak looked huge but I heard someone say it had little flavor.   I had the broiled seafood special for $29.95 but when I got the check it was $39.95. I didn't complain because I thought it was too cheap for lobster, giant shrimp and giant scallops, clams, mussels, rice and vegetabales plus a garden salad.  It was very good.  I also had the shrimp appetizer (5 giant cocktail shrimp).    Took a long time to get my main dish and the check/paying it.   Food has always been very good.  Free valet parking."}
{"text":"Visited this place for dinner, it had it's moments. The waiter was courteous with a slight Spanish accent, adding to the authenticity of the place. The bread and butter they served was sub-par, you'd expect them to do better. The side salad was served with a Thousand Island  dressing, all the authenticity built up by the ambience and our waiter was fading away real quick; until the Chorizo and cheese stuffed oysters were brought out. The flavor of the chorizo, cheese and oyster complimented each other really well. I ordered one of the specials here, Wild Boar. Two, single bone tender and succulent pieces of wild boar, as huge as my fist. The meat literally fell off the bone as I dug in, you really don't have to use the mega-knife that comes with it. It was my first experience with a wild boar, and what an experience it was. Complimenting the entree was some delicious Spanish rice with boiled vegetables and a slightly disappointing side of fried potato chips. The desert - Crème brûlée, a rich custard base topped with a layer of perfectly torched caramel made up for the sub-par bread and salad dressing. Like I said it, Mallorca has it's moments, I'd definitely recommend this place for a casual date night. Be ready to shell out some extra cash though."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you want some fresh fish or spanish cuisine in the Pittsburgh area.  They always seem to have a list of like 20 different specials, including so many fresh fish options I don't know how they do it.  I can barely keep up as they go through the specials list it is so long.  I also love their outdoor seating area when the weather is nice and the staff are very friendly and attentive.  The food is all very good, though some of it is on the blander side and could maybe use a little spicing up.  Some of the prices are a little high, but many of these are high quality meat and fish options and all the portions were quite large and entrees all came with salad and side dishes so you never go hungry. Though sometimes I wish I could have some variety in the sides they serve with it since the side of rice and veggies and those crispy potato chips can be rather bland.  I'd rather have a cheaper dish that doesn't come with all that so I can try some of the other appetizers instead.   I do like that they also serve up some of their fresh fish whole.  The flaming Spanish sausage is also a fun appetizer to get (it comes out on a flaming ceramic pig!)."}
{"text":"Took the Novia here this past Friday. Excellent service with excellent food. The environment at Mallorca makes you feel welcome.   I ordered the paella and the flavors were absolutely delicious. Just good authentic cuisine tiered to what Mallorca stands for.   The sangria is excellent I recommend getting the pitcher to tag along with your meal. Overall, a definite must if you are from the Pittsburgh area or just visiting."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for years and finally made it. I've always thought the menu looked great but questioned whether it was worth the cost.      We started with some Tapas, Fried Olives and Lamb Meatballs. The Olives were the best. Then a small salad. Mix the House and Balsamic Dressings. Much nicer that way.      We had two Chicken Dishes and an Egg Plant with Pasta. The Pasta was worth the money.      We also had a boring Cheese Cake and some very good Flan.      This is a nice place for a special dinner if you want to spend the extra money on service. The food isn't really worth the cost and we ate the more inexpensive items. I had wanted fish but wasn't spending $35 for a Swordfish Steak.      The best part of the meal was the Rice. Absolutely Outstanding!      You can find the same food for less money or make it yourself for much less.       If you want a more reasonable evening eat at their Tapas bar next door."}
{"text":"Maybe 4 stars for Pittsburgh.  Hit or miss on the main courses - I like the green sauce on seafood. But the flan never failed me and the whole show is pretty entertaining.  Stil, miss I. and Jenn pretty much sum it's low points . . ."}
{"text":"My data points for Spanish food are not from this part of the country, so I might have different standards.  We organized a big brunch event here on a Sunday, and they were very accommodating. The set lunch started with sangria and an array of appetizers, like mushrooms, shrimp, and chorizo. Then each person got to pick an entree, with vegetables and rice on the side. After that, there was even a choice of dessert!  The amount of food was eye-poppingly American. I stuffed myself on the appetizer, unaware that there was more food. The main dish I got was the paella. But it was, unfortunately, quite bland, with the chicken and shrimp overcooked. However, the dessert flan was pretty decent.   I think this is a great place to hold events at, especially when the waitstaff was patient and coordinated. It is also surprisingly cheap, but again, my price point is from the SF bay area. However, personally, I didn't really care for the food that much, so I decided to put it at a 3-star."}
{"text":"This is going to be an expensive meal.  Because there are way too many things on the menu that you will want to try.  It happened to us.  And it was wonderful too.  Spend the money.  The atmosphere is as good as it gets.  The wait staff are phenomenal in how they treat you while you are seated in their restaurant.  If you want to impress someone, take them to Mallorca.  If you want to treat yourself, then get yourself to Mallorca.   It is an experience."}
{"text":"OK, I want you to know that this review is for my only experience there, which was a \"business dinner\" in the back room several months ago. I imagine that individual diners may have a different experience, but alas, this was mine. I do enjoy Spanish food (a lot...) and plan to return to try them out again in the near future.  We had a smattering of pre-ordered tapas to start - these ranged from stuffed peppers and calamari (really tasty), to the traditional \"tortilla\" egg and onion dish. I must say that these were delicious and well prepared - these dishes definitely whet my appetite for things to come...  For my main dish, I figured that a paella would be a \"signature dish\" for a Spanish restaurant, and decided to indulge. Unfortunately, I was VERY disappointed in this dish overall, as it was mostly a gargantuan pile of yellow rice with small amounts of chicken, fish, and seafood. I've had paellas many, many times, and have come to expect a certain level of excellence with this dish, although it is very challenging to prepare. Perhaps it was the large number of diners we had with our group, but this dish was hastily thrown together, and basically tasted as if it had come directly from a Vigo box.  The atmosphere is nice - we sat in their banquet room, and it was an attractive, comfortable place to conduct our meeting and eat. Service was EXCELLENT - the wait staff kept all the drinks topped off, and were extremely attentive. I especially liked the sangria, it was delicious, and plentiful!  So, while I've given it a paltry two stars for this single experience, I believe that mitigating factors could be in play here, and will give them a second chance sometime soon. We plan to focus mainly on a tapas style dinner, rather than having the entrees - the enormous portions of all the entrees I saw really was a bit of a turn-off... The excellent, friendly service, I suspect, is more representative of what they are trying to accomplish here."}
{"text":"I don't normally like seafood but I suggested Mallorca for a family dinner when my mom and grandparents were coming into the city. It was perfect because there is valet so my grandparents didn't have to walk too far. The food exceeded my expectations but the service was OUTSTANDING. I had been here a couple of times for drinks with friends and the bartender, Marcelo, remembered me and treated me and my family very well for dinner. Plus, he charmed my grandmother :) I will definitely be bringing the family back again."}
{"text":"Was my first time ..I saw mixed reviews and was skeptical ... the service was great.our server was super nice he answered any questions we had and gave us reccomendations... could not believe how great the food was..ordered the twin lobster tails and added the crab and shrimp stuffing.. the portions were amazing and my entree was unbeleivable.. if you havnt tried this place its definatly a must! It is now one of my fav places in the pittsburgh area ..I wanted to make sure I left a review because it was just THAT GOOD...can not WAIT TO GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"I have been thinking about eating at this place for a while, finally made it in.   I don't understand why the rating isn't a solid four stars. The negative ratings all reflect to me that some people don't really know what to expect for this style of food.   We had several appetizers, all were fantastic. The calamari, the stuffed mushrooms, and one of the stuffed peppers. We loved them all.  I had the special, wild boar shank. It Was cooked tender and in served in a great sauce.  My daughter in law had the Bife  Portuguese.  It Was cooked to.perfection. my wife had the halibut. They were very attentive to my daughter in law food allergies too.  Everything on every table around us looked great too. Two thumbs up! We will be back for sure!  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food was the bomb, everything cooked to perfection, great waitstaff and friendly owners.  Highly recommended for group dinners or a date.  Beware, portions are huge so watch your diet/eating fro earlier that day."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food and service are consistently great every time I'm here. I recommend the stuffed mushrooms, Chilean Seabass, red sangria & Spanish coffee. However, I've never had something I don't like!"}
{"text":"After reading positive reviews decided to give it a try. Must say the service was superb, we were sat immediately, we were not smothered but at no time had to wait when we needed something and once we ordered the food came in a timely fashion. We ordered the Linguica as an appetizer and it was very good, having it flamed table-side was a great plus. I ordered the paella and it was much more than I could eat and packed with a nice variety of seafood plus chicken and sausage. Other food ordered at the table was very well prepared as well. Will definitely be going back on future trips and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant only twice, however I am a fan. I went for Valentine's day and their service was spectacular! I had the stuffed salmon, which was absolutely amazing, considering I NEVER order salmon at restaurants, but I'm glad I did! Their sangria is good and strong! The services is impeccable from the bus boys to the managers, everyone is so accommodating, it really makes for a comfortable environment. I've also had their stuffed lobster, which I'm not really a huge fan of, I've tasted better elsewhere, and the lobsters weren't impressive in size. The downside was the wait time, each time I went it took at least 30-40 minutes for my meal to come to my table."}
{"text":"A fun evening....the sangria was flowing and the meals were awesome. The restaurant was not very crowded and that helped with the noise levels. Always a good meal and great service has been my experience at Mallorca."}
{"text":"I had heard good things and expected quality food and a good experience even though I was planning to do take-out. I ordered two garlic shrimp appetizers, two soups of the day, and garlic chicken with rice. The service was pleasant and the bartender assisted with my order. The food was prepared in ~20 minutes and smell from the packaging was alluring.  The packing however was inappropriate and led to the sauce spilling throughout the box. Additionally, instead of using clear covers over the foil containers, white covers were used so it was impossible to quickly check to see if all food ordered had been packed and given to me. That's a rookie mistake an experienced restaurant shouldn't be making--it led to my rice being left out. I literally received chicken bathing in a ton of sauce and zero rice.   The soups had a very odd flavor. They consisted of kale, olive oil (Lord knows why) and a green broth. If the oil hadn't been there it would have been pleasant. The chicken was good but far too thin. The shrimp were okay but overcooked. And they packed two orders of shrimp into one container. Why? How did they know two different people wouldn't be eating the shrimp appetizers?   I would return to try dining at Mallorca. But I wouldn't do takeout again. They don't pack appropriately and seem to take liberties with take-out customers that they would not take with dine-in customers."}
{"text":"Getting to the restaurant from any direction is a challenge on a weekend night, on which the South Side is a hub of frenzied activity, hordes of young people throughout the area and gridlock on the streets.  Mallorca does not have sufficient capacity in its parking lot, which is adjacent to the restaurant, for which there is a fee of $5 plus gratuity.  When one enters the restaurant on a weekend night, they must first navigate wall-to-wall people in the bar in order to approach the stand where the hostess and owner are stationed.    I have no complaint about waiting for a table.  As soon as all the members of our party arrived, our OpenTable reservation garnered us a table immediately.  The dining room is as loud, uncomfortable, and jammed with tables of diners as one can imagine.  The tables are placed so as to allow but a few inches between parties, not the way I wish to enjoy an expensive meal at an exclusive restaurant.  It is not possible to enjoy intimate conversation when one must lean over the table and speak loudly to address their guests.  The strong suit of the restaurant is the gracious service and warm welcome that is provided by every skilled staff member, including owner Antonio Pereira.  A team of young men provides service to the table.  Mr. Pereira came to the table to ensure our satisfaction, always a nice and appreciated touch.  Numerous specials are announced with flair, but without any indication of the prices, which are high. Our dinner check for four was $205.20.  My pork chops in garlic sauce entree contained a generous three chops taking up a large plate, but they were served with no topping or sauce, and were dry. My fellow diners seemed to enjoy their entrees: osso buco special, vegetarian paella, and veal in cream sauce.  The portions of most dishes are generous and many will take home part of their meals.  Rather than to allow the customer to choose what they would like, the restaurant makes it easy for itself by providing one type of salad and standard side dishes to all.  Included with dinners is a small salad on a tiny plate, topped with a delicious thousand island dressing.  Side dishes are plain, unseasoned, bland fresh vegetables: cauliflower, peas, a couple of carrot slices, and a couple of green beans, and a small plate of tasty, but not crisp homemade chips that had apparently been prepared long before being served.  With the exception of the delicious and appetizing creme brulee, which I ordered, the desserts do not lend themselves to being shared; they are small portions.  Mallorca, housed on the crazed South Side, and a significant distance from my home, is not going to be my choice for an expensive evening out in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious all around. So many specials that i felt like i needed to take notes. (Mallorca if youre reading this maybe print them on a menu insert it was seriously overwhelming to listen to 10+ options not already on the menu). A little expensive but for a special occasion its worth it! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I celebrated my first year anniversary here with my wife when we first started dating and 11 years later we are still coming here to celebrate milestones in our lives. Every couple has their place and this is ours. The food is always done right, the service is impeccable. We love the atmosphere, it's busy but not loud where you can't hear the person in front or beside you. We've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here in years (because I had moved away and just hadn't thought about it since returning to Pittsburgh).  I was reminded of the place when I saw a recent Groupon offer.  This place is still as good as I remembered.  The helpings are huge.  The garlic soup is wonderful!  I will definitely put it back in my rotation."}
{"text":"I guess I'm due for a bad meal.  But actually the entire experience was rather bad. Here's how it went on a busy Saturday night at Mallorca:  We had reservations and were seated quickly.  The dining room was packed.  We were given a list of specials that was quite long.  Monkfish, sea bass, duck and goat were items that piqued my interest.  We started with a pitcher of sangria, white.  We were told that the red and white were the same, except for the wine base.  The Sangria was good, but I cannot believe that the red is orange flavored.  Note:  go with the red. The men also ordered drinks, which never came.  Friends ordered stuffed lobster and prime rib.  Hubs had the paella.  All were served excellent portions and all thoroughly enjoyed their meals. I asked for more information on the goat and was told it was \"large pieces of meat in a red wine sauce, on the bone\".  The sauce was excellent.  The two bites of meat were also excellent.  The bone was apparently the spine.  Getting the meat was impossible, expecially with a large dull table knife. The pieces were also sawed apart, leaving large shards of bone throughout the whole dish. I was raised on a farm - we called this stew meat.    The balance of the meal: rice, veggies and chips were served family style.  I ate some rice, because I could easily 'sop up' my excess sauce.  No other plates were left to eat the sides.  The chips were good.  Hubs asked for his diet coke, again, mid way through the meal.  My plate looked almost exactly the same when I was finished (except for the shards of bone that I stacked on the far lip of the dish.)  We opted out of dessert but very much enjoyed the almond liquer which was served.  I guess you need that clinker every so often to appreciate the fabulous efforts of the fabulous eateries of Pittsburgh.  I will try Mallorca again - I saw some beautiful dishes being served, some at my table.  But I will certainly stick to what they are known for - seafood.  Way too expensive to venture into other areas of the menu."}
{"text":"Not what is used to be. Food OK but prices sky high. We stopped by because we used to live in the 'burg and frequented Mallorca a lot.  Not what it used to be..  :("}
{"text":"Frankly Im surprised at the one- and two-star reviews of Mallorca. Especially the comments about \"bad service\", I dont get it. My wife and I have been there at least 10 times over the past few years and have ALWAYS been treated like kings! The staff has always been super attentive in my book, alot of the bad reviews appear to be coming from people living on the west coast (?). What more are you looking for?  The food is outstanding, huge portions of quality food. Steaks are really great, last time I was there had the Lamb shanks special, was out of this world good. The meat literally fell off the bone and the sauce was so tasty I had to mop it up with the delicious bread. My wife is a picky pain in the butt, but Mallorca is her favorite restaurant in the 'burgh. Try the Chorizo appetizer, its tasty. Sangria is top-notch too. The prices are not cheap, but as in life, you get what you pay for.  If your food choices revolve around Mc Donalds and Taco bell, you probably cant appreciate Mallorca and should go somewhere else. But if you like fine food prepared and thought out with care, Mallorca is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mallorca a few times before, and I'll admit I always get the same thing, the Mariscada, because it is soo good! My most recent trip was on a Monday night with a 7:45 reservation. This place was PACKED. We were greeted by the hostess who told us they were backed up and it would be about a 20 minute wait so we could walk around or have a drink at the bar. We chose to walk around and came back about 15 minutes later and sat down like others who were waiting were doing. The hostess seemed to be really frazzled, but had no system of seating people who were there. There were quite a few couples waiting and when a table of 2 became available she asked what times both couples reservations were for. They both said 8. She then attempted to seat them as my boyfriend and I were sitting there waiting. The person was nice enough to offer up her seat to us as she'd heard me say we had a 7:45 reservation. The hostess apologized, but maybe a system of checking in (or calling names out instead of seating  the first person you see) would be helpful.  We were seated and someone came by and told us the specials. Am I the only person who has trouble remembering any of the specials they tell you? There are always like 10 told to you at rapid fire, I can never remember any that interest me.  I ordered Mariscada, the boyfriend ordered Paella. We were given a sourdough type bread and then a salad. Our orders came out not too much later, with veggies, fried potato chip like things, and Spanish rice. Veggies were nothing to write home about. But my entree is so delicious. I just love dipping bread in the rich tomato sauce.  My only problems really were with the seating problem and the lack of drink refills. I feel bad, because obviously the waiters work their butts off but our waters and sodas were empty more often than they were full. But, it was difficult to enjoy a great meal when I was constantly thirsty. Maybe our table wasn't in a good spot to see our glasses but when someone is running around refilling water, they should be able to see all tables.  After we received our check, we were given 2 shots, \"on the house\" which was a nice gesture, Not sure if the waiter felt bad or if this is normal. We also had a Steeler sighting at the bar, so that makes for a fun dining experience. We'll go back but hopefully won't experience a few of the kinks we had this time. \""}
{"text":"Been here once and overall experience was okay. The server who took our order was definitely rushing me when I was ordering - asked him how he was and he pretty much just nodded and then gestured me to order - he was obviously very impatient. The food was okay and we didn't have to wait a long time for it. Had the cheesecake for dessert which was good until you were near the end of it and it almost tasted like it had freezer burn. They gave us the wrong bill and it seemed like  they took a while until they were able to find our right one. Not to mention you have no idea what you were being charged for because your order was just scribbled onto this check pad with more prices on the right than what was written down on the left.  Overall, the atmosphere was great and the restaurant is beautiful and trendy (like something I would find in NYC)."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Went there for a friend's birthday. Ordered the crab-stuffed lobster - AMAZING! The waiter even offered to deshell the lobster. We brought a cake for our friend and they took it back to the kitchen and cut it for us, put candles in it, brought it out and served it to us. The staff is just amazing!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite restaurant. Their staff is very friendly and their service is the best around. You can't go wrong with any meal from here. They have amazing appetizers like prosciutto stuffed calamari and grilled portobellos with real balsamic vinaigrette (not the fake stuff from the store). Their entree portions are very generous. I ordered their paella and had enough for two more days worth of meals!"}
{"text":"I have been to Spain, so was expecting more of a tapas experience, but the menu consisted more of a standard appetizers/entrees selection.  We over ordered, getting lobster bisque (soup of the day), calamari stuffed with prosciutto, and garlic shrimp as appetizers, then a wagu porterhouse, trout stuffed with crabmeat, and a seafood pasta- all to share among 4 people. The entrees come with Spanish rice (similar to what you might see in paella), steamed veggies, and house baked chips to share as well - so we had more than enough. Service was good, and they gave us side salads and almond liquor shots on the house. I liked that it wasn't dimly lit, which I feel like is common at most restaurants for dinnertime, so we could actually see each other.   Slightly disappointing if you're looking for a traditional tapas place, but otherwise great."}
{"text":"Hip hip hooray a little dollop of diversity in Pittsburgh! I'll admit as soon as I saw the outside of the building on my morning commute shortly after moving to Pittsburgh, I wanted to test the skills of La Cocina Mallorca.  I have tried the veal; it was tender breaded just right and savory perfect combination not too heavy and not too light. The side dishes could be improved I don't love the potato thingies and the veggies are ok. But I forgot about that because the meat was so splendid.   I also tried the sea bass which was a special at the time. All I can say is that it was to die for good, I mean so tender not too many times do I die from the textures of foods, often they can be off putting to me. But this sea bass was cooked to texture tender perfection. My family tried lobster and Paella, it was the most sea food in a Paella my stepmother had ever seen. My dad had no complaints about his stuffed lobster.   Great and expansive choice of wines, admittedly I am not a wine pro nor do I have the $$ to spend on some of their wines. But the Sauvington blanc from Argentina was fab, it was the 30$ bottle.   Now can I talk about the decor? When you first walk in you are hit with Art Deco Egyptian revival beauty not familiar with the term.... Ok picture Lotus Flowers, Neo- Victorian woodwork, gorgeous glass behind the bar. It looks the kind of place Capone would waltz into with a dame on his arm, or Bonnie and Clyde Barker would dine at instead of rob.   The back is not as pretty to me, resembles more of an Italian garden party theme, meets den parlor feel.   I've never had an issue with service here, yes the waiters speak with thick accents, because they might be Portuguese or Spanish. This does not bother me when I am faced with accents from a language of a more speedy vernacular I listen harder. It usually works, or you can always ask a second person for help if you cannot understand your waiter.   I would make reservations, it does get very busy on weekend evenings, they have valet parking which is always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"So gross I created a yelp. The seafood was overcooked and flavorless in paella. Very bland flavors. They give you a disgusting amount of food and sides. Focus on portions and not quality or flavor or substance of food. Its like what people think is fancy and good but is actually shit food. Like for instance the stuffing in the stuffed salmon and stuffed mushrooms was the exact same thing lol. Just absolutely underwhelming in every way."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the atmosphere here. I've been here twice and each experience wad different. The only thing consistent is the service. My Mahi Mahi on the other hand was bland and I was super disappointed.  For what I was paying for I wanted to really enjoy it but it was under seasoned and not worth the money. I was also a bit peeved that I called before buying a living social deal and they told me I could use it as long as someone else didn't have that deal. And when it came to pay they informed me that even if someone has a separate deal on a separate bill,  no two people at one table can use a coupon. The rum and ginger ale I got was good and so were my sides. Hopefully when I use my Living Social deal that I still have,  it will be a different experience. I just expected the moon and stars for what I was paying. Maybe they were having a bad day. My friends enjoyed their food. The side dishes were great. The staff was awesome but I feel like the food needs to catch up with the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had a pretty great experience here!   We made reservations, which was good because it was a Saturday night. We were seated quickly. They listed the specials but the list was super long so I wish there was a printed copy or at least somewhere where the specials were listed. The table we sat at broke...a portion of it broke up and we realized that portion was held by duct tape...we told the staff and they very quickly brought us to a new table.   My one other complaint was that when one of the servers was putting the plates down, one of them was dirty and still had a piece of salad on it...he got rid of it quickly but it was still something I noticed.   Onto the food! You get a salad with you dinner meal, as well as some bread for the table. I ordered the ravioli stuffed with lobster with white sauce, and let me tell you, ITS AMAZING!!!! It was soooo good! I literally devoured it. Entrees also come with rice, fried potatoes, and vegetables served family style, which I thought was really nice. The flan was meh but the creme brûlée was yummy!   Service was also fast and friendly.   The place is pricey, but I really enjoyed my food and experience."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Food is amazing, staff is impeccable. There menu is great but order their specials because they are ridiculous. We're from Florida but just had the best swordfish ever here. The staff seriously waits on you hand and foot, you're treated like you're at a four star restaurant but they have 3 star prices, seriously very reasonable $ for what you get. The portion sizes are quite large."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to go for special occasions, however on our last two visits... I hated my meal. First my lobster was barely cooked...had to microwave it when I got home. Second meal was a seafood pot and the sauce/broth was not to my liking at all. I think my problem is that I am not a saffron girl but if you love the spice then you will love this place. They still have great sangria, amazing desserts and the menu is huge. The waitstaff are very formal and professional but they know how to make a celebration worth while. Still a great place to go...just have to be honest with my last two meals."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. Really good food, good seasonal/special occasion menus, and I love the shot at the end of the meal. Service has always been good."}
{"text":"Food is ok if you like spicy. In their defense maybe that is what Spanish is supposed to be like. Was disappointment that they had a special menu that was off limits to the living social coupon.  It was not mentioned on the living social coupon however that you had to stick to their main menu. I might mention that the food on the anniversary menu was not that cheap (19.00 a dinner). Would likely not be back but alas,have another coupon to use in the future. Well, maybe for the courtyard ambiance in the summer. Might be your thing though, if you don't mind the expense and you like spicy food and under cooked vegetables.  ++ positive remark for convenient parking, which is a real find in  south side."}
{"text":"Celebrated a friend's birthday dinner here on a Friday night. I ordered the pork chops with garlic sauce, which ended up being a poor choice. I could barely eat more than a few bites of it. The pork was dry and bland, and the sauce did not do anything to help. (Brought it home and gave it to the boyfriend.) Luckily, there were some potato chips on the table, so that saved me from being hungry. I did try my friend's paella though and it was fine.   Still, great service (a very lively \"happy birthday\" sung to my friend, among other things), and I enjoyed the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the restaurant. Just wish my meal were a lot better.   Taste | 2 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3 Service | 5 OVERALL | 2.5"}
{"text":"Something for just about everyone to eat. Huge portions of beef, suckling pig, rabbit, goat, 24 oz lobster tail, stuffed peppers, stuffed quail, seafood casserole, fish, 32 oz delmonico steak and, of course, paella all washed down with Sangria.  Friendly, entertaining service and a chance to brush up on your Spanish if you want make this a great place for a birthday or event.  At the end of the meal adults are treated to a shot of Dorhina, a Portuguese almond liqueur that is smooth as smooth can be. It can be a bit noisy on a busy night."}
{"text":"I LOVE visiting Mallorca.  It refreshes my great memories from my time living in Spain.  My friend and I visited on Friday to get some scrumptious spanish cuisine.  The food came out very quickly and was as good as ever!  The service is always great and fast as well.  I was sad to see more tables weren't filled up!  The only thing I was bummed about was, the minute we brought out a meal deal coupon, the great service stopped.  We never got the shot EVERYONE (other than those underage) gets after their meals, we didn't get drink refills (we would have drank another glass of sangria!), etc.  But, otherwise, it was scrumptious as always and the service was great till the coupon showed up :)"}
{"text":"Had the wild boar it was fantastic the meat was tender and juicy. The red mole sauce brought out the robust rustic flavor of the meat. The staff and service was the best I have seen in a while. The owner was very attentive and friendly.  The desserts are a explosion of the taste buds almond cake and flan were out of this world."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Their paella is amazing. Authentic Spanish cuisine. The crab stuffed lobster tail is like you've never seen before. Wine selection is excellent and the waitstaff is phenomenal. Possibly one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great Service Great food. There were as many specials named off by the waiter than there were items on the menu. I wanted to try them all. Great variety and choices. I enjoyed the Pallela, the seafood including lobster tails were cooked to perfection. Next time I am in Pittsburgh I would come here again"}
{"text":"I think my love affair with Mallorca is over. I used to come here all the time, but let me give you the rundown on why I think we've grown apart and why I would prefer to spend my $$$ elsewhere.  No valet last night but we got a spot in the lot for free which was great.  It feels fancy inside. It was a nice excuse for date night and to get dressed up a bit.    As soon as we entered there were lots of friendly movements to take our coats and offer us to our table.  They knew us by the reservation, and even knew who we were when I called to confirm they were open during an ice storm.  We had an expiring groupon that we had to use, and studded snow tires, nothing holding us back.  It was 830 and not many people were there. There were two people at the bar we knew, (love Pittsburgh's two degrees of separation) and only two tables were seated in the restaurant.  I spotted at least 6 waitstaff in their spiffy black vests milling around.  First thing I liked/didn't like. The waiter rattled off a huge list of appetizer and entree specials. This was both impressive and annoying at the same time. We couldn't remember half the list, but it would take too long to repeat. A printed copy would have been better.  The Sour dough bread was very tasty, nice crust / soft middle, could have been a bit better if warmer. the butter was lame.... peel away butter pats, like you'd see at the likes of Eat N Park. they were frustratingly difficult to open and not enough butter inside to make the effort worth it. Maybe good for dieting but not to go with the bread.  Other Portuguese restaurants have good honey butters or at least a nice dish to scoop out butter. For the expense of this place, I expect more.  We had a Premier France Champagne that wasn't bad for $32.  It was less expensive than the least expensive sparkling wine.   They were a bit over the top regarding pouring of the champagne. I love a good show, but it took a while, and it held up another waiter waiting to serve us our  stuffed mushrooms and calamari.    Finally, a third waiter pulled the adjoining table together so that we could receive our appetizers and didn't have to get rid of bread or salad plates.  The Calamari breading had a wonderful light crispness to it, but sadly they were super tough and chewy inside.   The mushrooms stuffed with crabmeat were good but not super exciting. But the sauce was really good with the sour dough.  Unfortunately, the head waiter/manager came over and took my bread plate away while I was mid bite. I was too confused to realize he was taking it away altogether, it still had food on it, he was super quick and never asked me if I was finished.   They were just seating a new table for two, no reason to rush, and we now had an extended table, so why? It left me with no plate to put my share of the tough calamari or mushrooms on. Luckily I was with my husband we share, what if it were a first date?  Adam really liked the sauce on his steak. If you have had the steak years ago, it's changed to a Portuguese style sirloin with two eggs and lots of garlic slivers.  I miss the old, but this newer version was good.  We were both happy with the perfectly blanched veggies.   My Wild Boar Osso Bocca literally fell off the bone and was very tasty.  When the head guy asked how things were, I felt moved to be truthful but not in a bitchy way. we said how everything was lovely but that the calamari was super tough and chewy. He said he'd tell the chef but nothing came of it.  Adam had the Plain cheese cake,  not overly sweet and he loved that the focus was on the good tasting cheesecake  My Creme Brûlée was a treat with a nice crispy cover and a good custard.  The cappuccinos were a good finish to a nice meal.   And they didn't have the surprise shot of that yummy liquor that I remembered.   It's been a few years. maybe it's not just Mallorca that has changed. Maybe it's me.   Was it worth $100 (not including the wine)?  No.  It's a nice show, but Pittsburgh has changed too and I think there are enough fine dining restaurants now that they need to up their game to get my attention."}
{"text":"A little slow on the service, extensive special menu show, they screwed their chick scratch bill and it actuallu benefittdd ibiza or Mallorca we will Come again"}
{"text":"The grilled selections, excellent. We tried the 34 oz delmonico steak was perfect, and the grilled seafood platter, yummy. Done to perfection. The highlight of the meal.  Sausage appetizer, good. Garlic shrimp, good.  The Paella and other dishes, meh. 2 stars at best.   The Paella was a disappointment. They used their regular rice and just added stuff to it. Definitely not the classical paella where the rice and food is cooked together.  The assorted seafood salsa verde, meh. The seafood was cooked correctly, but the salsa verde wasn't like any salsa verde that I had before. Bland. Not recommended.  Definitely not green.  Service was ok. It could have been more attentive. We had to keep asking for items, refills, bread, etc. This should have been handled automatically.  All in all, I wouldn't consider this a Spanish restaurant, but a bar and grill. If you  stick with the grilled selections, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a charming restaurant! I felt like I wasn't even in Pittsburgh! The food was authentic, delicious and nicely-portioned! The service was a team effort! I definitely recommend it and will be back!"}
{"text":"High Priced with Poor Quality Food and Service  We had a dinner reservation yesterday at Mallorca and were thoroughly disappointed and outdone by the poor service and the quality of the food, which was nearly inedible.   Although we were seated promptly, the two waters that we received were not drinkable. Unbelievably, one had a mouth print on the glass (which suggests it wasn't washed properly) and the other had a gnat on the outside of the glass. When we pointed this out to the server, he hesitated to bring fresh water in clean glasses. He took the glass of water, but was not even competent enough to wipe off the gnat completely, he simply brought the water back as if the smashed gnat on the glass would be invisible.  We finally requested that the two dirty glasses be left on the table and that two additional glasses be brought to make sure that the request was actually honored.   We requested straws that weren't even properly packaged. They were not enclosed in plastic or paper. Needless to say, we decided against drinking ANY of the water because we were concerned that it was contaminated.   The food (Salmon and Vegetarian Paella) was unseasoned and not very appetizing in presentation.  We were served salad that did not appear to be fresh, and the dressing was already on it. We had to request salad without the dressing but with oil and vinegar, which is what we prefer and what we would've expressed had we simply been asked. The glass containers that the oil and vinegar were in were greasy and appeared unclean.   We did not enjoy the meal or the overall experience. We felt sorely disappointed by the service and would never consider patronizing this establishment again. Dining at Mallorca was a waste of money, and had we not been in a celebratory mood from the outset, we would not have been able to endure the poor service and the poorly prepared food."}
{"text":"Not quite sure why it only has 3 1/2 stars but it was amazing. We came here on a guest recommendation from the hotel. The food was just amazing as the service. Its is very similar to Italian yet different. I had the fresh Dover Sole whole. They filleted it perfectly (no bones) and it melted in my mouth. I also had the garlic soup and it was to die for. A lot of the items we ordered were on the specials, so I don't remember them. The wait staff was superb, friendly, and courteous even though we were a little under-dressed.  The place might have been pricier and a little to much for kids in most peoples opinion, but so worth it and they were excellent to my kids."}
{"text":"Mallorca lived up to its reputation in my book.  We felt welcomed from the moment we stepped in to the very end when the owner shook our hands and thanked us for coming.   The service staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and there for your every need.  We started off with their homemade red sangria and Shrimp Bisque...both of which are not to be missed!  The Sangria has just the right mix of fruity flavor and alcohol.  They were also very good and making sure your glass was more than half full.  For dinner, we ordered one item from the menu, Lobster Ravioli and three from the daily specials; Rack of Lamb, Swordfish and the Bone in Prime Rib.  Each plate was better than the last!  Everything was cooked perfectly and the flavors were close your eyes when you take a bite good.  The Bone in Prime Rib arrived at the table and you felt as if you were in the opening scene of the Flintstones...it was HUGE!  We laughed when our waiter told us that this was the \"small\" cut.  The family style sides of saffron rice, hand-made chips and steamed veggies were all very tasty.  They were not only generous with the portions but willing to refill anything that we finished.   The prices were not cheap - but the quality of food tied with the experience of being there made it very worth it.   I think the only disappointment was that some of the patrons were dressed really casual.  I know that is a personal thing that makes me sound like a snob, but seriously, this restaurant is more of an event than just somewhere to grab a \"bite\".  It didn't change my experience but I noticed it.   I certainly plan to return in the very near future.  If you are looking for somewhere special to go where the food is wonderful, the service will make you smile and you will remember your meal for a long time. Well done Mallorca. Well done!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  Food was bad both times.  I really wanted to like it based on the other reviews, but couldn't finish my meal either time.  Fortunately, it was really expensive, so it made not liking my food feel even better.    Another of those mystery institutions (along with Primanti Bros. and Le Monte) that everyone in Pittsburgh but me seems to like.  I'm sure this all stems from the fact that I'm just deeply flawed as a human.  But there you go.  Caveat Lector.  or Caveat Comesor?  Is that right?"}
{"text":"The place was PACKED so make sure you get a reservation for a weekend.  They had some groups in and had way more people than they should have inside one room.  However, the service did not falter one bit.  We ordered soft shell crabs for an appetizer and I wish I had gotten it as a dinner.  It was perfect.  I had a full fish for dinner, and although very good, it wasn't boned and I had to ask to get it boned, but even then it had loads of bones and was almost scary to eat.  My husband had the steak that was incredible!  We could easy have shared it.  The salad was great, the vegetables good (but I would have liked some Spanish olive oil for them as they were plain.  But everything we asked for, they brought with no problem.  Wonderful food."}
{"text":"My favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. Steaks are fantastic. Service is the absolute best."}
{"text":"This place aspires to be fancier than it actually is.  Prices are exorbitantly high, tricking you into thinking you're going to get a quality meal.   To assist in achieving this effect, they have white table cloths; I can't speak for all of them but ours was dirty, stained, unpressed, and had something smushed into it that frankly resembled something that would come out of a child's nostril.  My boyfriend tactfully placed a plate over that offensive blemish.   By the way, the plates and silverware look exactly like ones you'd find in a roadside diner or Eat n Park.  Just drives the point home that this is not upscale dining.  They start you out with some bread and butter in little packets (olive oil would have been a nicer touch), and a sad little salad - the greens were wilted and yellowing, and the lettuce hadn't been washed. You could see a large amount of dirt on the white part,  which no, I was not mistaking for pepper.  I also made the mistake of ordering the gazpacho, which was way too salty. I couldn't finish it.  We ordered a bottle of wine; the waiter poured the first glass, then noticed himself that the glass was not clean.  He took it away and brought back a clean glass, apparently having dumped the first glass of wine out.  For a $40 bottle of wine, it was a bit annoying to lose one full glass which he didn't offer to replace.  The meal was slightly redeemed by the entrees; we ordered two of the innumerable specials the waiter rattled off.  Our entrees were each $35, when the quality suggested a $10-15 price range.  The presentation was quite sad - on one side of the plate were some shreds of pickled purple cabbage, on the other, a sprinkle of paprika.  Entrees were accompanied by some sorry steamed vegetables (I agree with the other reviewers' that they look like they were straight out of one of those steamable bags), some orange rice, and a rather incongruous plate of potato chips.   I couldn't figure that one out.  As for the service, it was excessive and cloying.  We had 3 waiters checking on us- one main waiter, and two other waiters/busboys who interrupted our meal dozens of times.  Our water and wine glasses were refilled after every sip.   Our waiter would come by to check on us, then check on the table next to us, then turn around and check on us again, apparently forgetting we'd been checked on the previous minute.  I guess too much service is better than not enough, but we never had a moment to relax and have an uninterrupted conversation.  Look, I'm no snob but I've actually been to the coast of Spain and this food didn't resemble any of the care and refinement of actual Spanish cuisine.  I wouldn't be surprised if the chef has no culinary training whatsoever.  The last straw was when I used the ladies' room on our way out and was scalded by the water, which was hot coming out of both the cold and hot sides of the tap...like boiling hot...like my hands were red the rest of the evening.  We had tickets for a play after this meal and halfway into the show, my stomach started turning.   The next 10-12 hours were not pleasant.  Steer clear of this place, people, please, for your own good.  Bad music, bad ambiance, bad food.  Just bad."}
{"text":"Mallorca has been around a long time and like any business has its ups and downs. Is it as good as it was 20 years ago? Sure, but it seems to depend on the day. This is a place I was once addicted to and now can take it or leave it. I'd like to a more consistent experience."}
{"text":"Okay service, but great place for dinner especially with a big crowd. Went with my coworkers and the food was great. Wish the service was quicker."}
{"text":"Had a nice birthday celebration there this past weekend while visiting my niece who attends Pitt.  This restaurant was recommended by the concierge at our hotel and it was a winner.  As many of the other reviewers mentioned. the sangria is excellent, very refreshing and works with most of the entree choices.  We tried the garlic soup - yummy, except that poached egg thing still is a little freaky to me, and the calamari with prociuttio, which was excellent, especially considering I'm not much of a calamari fan (it's a texture thing for me!).  A few of us had the beef - filet or the Delmonico, both were huge and tasty.  Our niece, who indeed had been to Mallorca before, had the halibut with spinich and pine nuts.  She said she enjoyed it, but though the tilapia entree was even better.   Coffee and dessert was also very good.    Service was a little slow to start, but was very good throughout the meal.  This place apparently packs them in, especially on weekends, so make reservations!  Parking is a little tricky in Southside, but Mallorca had valet - definitely use it otherwise you'll be driving around forever.  I would definitely visit Mallorca again when we're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Mallorca in a long time, so we gave it a shot as we used to enjoy it.  HUGE MISTAKE. Terrible amateur service.  Foreign objects in food. Crazy prices for specials. No apologies. We had to wait in the very crowded bar area for over half an hour for our reservation.  Wine glasses were brought to the table still wet with water drops all over the glasses (not dried).  The waiter never re-poured and never brought a chiller as asked (we were outside on the patio, as it was the only table available, and the wine just got too hot). FYI, wine prices at 3 to 4 times retail doesn't help either.   As we were eating the appetizers they tried to serve salad (I had to shoo them away).  Then after salads were cleared, it took 45 minutes to get entrees.  ?? My daughter's paella had a large piece of plastic in it.  The waiter said \"it was just a piece of sausage casing\".  Are you kidding me?  No other explanation.  No price adjustment.  My son-in-law ordered Chilean Sea Bass which was a special.  We never asked the price and I was a bit surprised that it was $48.  In Pittsburgh...really??  My wife ordered the stuffed twin lobsters and each lobster came with only one claw.  When asked, the waiter said that is how they balance the weight, by removing one claw.  What??  Who cannot order 1 ¼ or 1  1/2 pound lobsters from their purveyor?  Total BS. In fairness, the garlic shrimp and stuffed calamari appetizers were good.  My mariscada was OK, as was the sea bass.  The lobsters tasted fine as was the paella (sans plastic).  Generally good, but not any better than that, and expensive for poor service and average food."}
{"text":"My mouth waters just thinking about Mallorca. I haven't been here in many years because I moved to San Francisco, but having been in town recently, I decided to take my husband there. I was hoping it was as good as I remembered it to be, and I was not disappointed.   We made reservations ahead of time since it was a friday night, but even still - the restaurant was not packed and we would have been able to be seated regardless.   We started off with some drinks - my husband had beer, and I had a glass of their house wine, salad and bread.   For appetizers, I ordered the garlic shrimp and he ordered one of their calamari specials. For the meals, he ordered a swordfish special and I ordered a 26oz stuffed lobster tail special. Dessert was flan and espresso for my husband, and I got the chocolate mousse.   The appetizers were excellent, perfectly cooked and quite a large portion. The sauces were excellent and they came out quickly.   The entrees were phenomenal. When my lobster tail came out, I literally got a standing applause from the table next to us. It was *enormous*. There was so much lobster, I actually had a doggie bag of lobster to take home. I've never tapped out on lobster before that day!   The desserts were okay. The flan was quite good, my husband is hispanic and has high flan standards -- he loved it. The chocolate mousse left a lot to be desired and really didn't have the airy, light texture. It was quite dense.   They offer a candied liquor as an after-dinner drink that was lovely.   It is a pricey dinner - the bill came out to be about 180 dollars and we tipped to bring it up to 250.00$. Its not something that you do everyday, but there is no reason not to make it a regular outing.   The service is absolutely impeccable with attentive wait staff and knowledgeable employees who are very well versed on the menu.   There is a pay parking lot next to the place, which is small and would easily fill up.  Valet would be a nice touch.   I'm looking forward to coming again on my next trip to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This is one of my top two Pittsburgh restaurants. I love the small space and cozy atmosphere. The lobster ravioli is by far my favorite thing on their menu! I definitely recommend trying it if they have it!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Staff are friendly and great food is served in generous portions! Very authentic Spanish cuisine."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, friendly waiters with great accents serving decent but not delicious food.  Most of the items we were served were not freshly prepared, our bread, vegetables, rice and chips all looked and tasted like they came out of a store bag, had been left out and were brought to us at room temperature.  The main dishes were okay, but not particularly well prepared, and weren't worth the high $30-$40 entree prices.  Mallorca is a beautiful place, particularly with their oudoor patio.  They have alot going for them, but at least, based on our meal, this restaurant is missing the high end food to go with it's high end staff, prices and ambiance."}
{"text":"Love love love!!  Staff, amazing. Food, fantastic. Wine (recommended by our server), incredible.  The only negative thing I have to say regarding my experience is that the parking lot was very crowded and busy, but that's probably because the restaurant is so good!"}
{"text":"After hearing great reviews about this place, I decided to check it out only regretting it after. The food honestly is okay...nothing really jumped out at me about the taste or quality...seemed REALLY overpriced for what you get. The portions are huge and the wait staff was impeccable, but I think I would rather pay more money for better tasting food. I've tried the duck and the fish and they were so so. The ambiance is a little weird too I thought...kind of reminds me of an old dank mansion...old tapestry and dark wood inside with areas of frosted glass (trying to bring in more light?). Regardless, I most likely will not try again."}
{"text":"The service and overall experience was impeccable. I had a great time in the lovely large room chatting with my friend while we had sangria (delicious!), waited for food, and ate. The waiters were super friendly and attentive and even allowed me to brush up some of my Spanish. It wasn't the quickest time waiting for our food, but that's to be expected of a traditional Spanish restaurant. They were also busy Saturday night as well.   We started off with the daily special appetizer of grilled octopus. This was so good, very tender, and it reminded me of Spain/Portugal. For entrees, we shared twin lobster tails stuffed with crab meat. The crab meat in it was very good, but I think the lobster may have been a little overcooked because it was dry and slightly tough. The seafood paella we got was a bit too salty for me. I actually liked the side of Spanish rice better than the rice in the paella because of the saltiness. The seafood in there was ok, but I couldn't finish even one piece of chicken because it was overcooked. The seafood in it was alright. I'm pretty picky with food even though I'll try pretty much anything.  At the end, they gave us two shots of complimentary almond liquor which was a nice gesture. I'd probably go back if I wanted to get a nice dinner while visiting Pitt again to get the grilled octopus and try other seafood again, maybe the daily specials are where it's at. The lobster tails and paella didn't quite do it for me. The ambience was really lovely though, but I wish the food was kicked up a notch.  PS They have complimentary valet parking to the left of the restaurant which is good because that area looked crazy when I was trying to get off the bridge"}
{"text":"I thought I was having dinner in Europe! Beautiful! Delicious! We will return multiple and bring friends."}
