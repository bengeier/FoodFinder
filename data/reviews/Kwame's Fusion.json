{"text":"Curry chicken & curry goat were pretty legit.  Took my parents there who normally have nothing but terrible things to say about the authenticity of west indian food, but they were all over it.  

Kwame brought them out some of his homemade achar, and that sealed it.  Best achar I've ever had, hands-down.  My parents both agreed that they haven't had achar like that since they left home, so for whatever that's worth.

The wait for food is a bit ridiculous.  Everything comes out fresh and cooked properly, but sometimes it just takes so long--even when you call ahead.  I hope this is a kink as part of a newish restaurant, because I really enjoy the food....whenever it decides to be ready."}
{"text":"Really, I have to give this place five stars, for the following reasons:
1. Great prices!
2. The portions are generous
3. The food is tasty.

There's nothing gourmet about this place. It's a diner. But it's a welcome addition to this little strip of Cosburn Ave., and if you're needing a meal and you're on a a budget, Kwame's won't disappoint.

One thing that should be noted: You can tell by the food quality that there's a lot of love happening in the kitchen, but because of this, things sometimes might be a bit slower out of the kitchen than you'd like, so be aware of that if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"The food tastes homemade, not overly salted, just tasty, like it came from your friend's West-Indian kitchen!

Had the curry chicken on rice, and my friend had the jerk chicken - both were really good.

I hope locals in the area will give this place a try, little places like this one deserve a shot!"}
