{"text":"tried 3 types of pierogies:

- bacon and cheddar: tasty! good pierogies, this was the first thing I tried so I was fairly impressed. but then...
- jerk chicken: dry chicken filling, sauce on the side was just ok. have tasted much better jerk flavoured sauces. but then it got worse:
- kimchi: weird textured and bland tasting mushroom filling, barely any kimchi on top, and the kimchi wasn't even good. disappointing and definitely not worth my money.

for $2 a pierogi, I want them all to be good. They should stick with the classic pierogies, in my opinion, the only ones worth eating (which is why they get 2 stars and not 1)."}
{"text":"Great affordable food and cocktails.  I am surprised it isn't so populated on a Thursday.  Definitely coming back.  I loved the mushroom kimchi perogis"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and not to be confused with the other pierogi places that pop up on the city. Homemade food and super reasonable. Had the cheese pierogi and cabbage roll. Delicious. Will be back!"}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE!

I lost it last night. Never had it happen to me in a restaurant in TO before, but it happen last night at \"The Saucy Pierogi\" an insult to anyone who knows what good food is!

Together with a group of seven friends, all Schnitzel lovers and connoisseurs, who had eaten it in other parts of the world and here in this great foodie city of ours, set down to try this place that the kitchen muse forgot. We ordered Chicken and Pork Schnitzels. We were served insults!
Very thin, over fried, over salty and too oily rubbery slabs of meet, about 1/3 the size of a schnitzel served any other place, in the city or other places in the world. That poor excuse tasteless \"smashed\" potato and fainted cabbage they call Sauerkraut simply completed the disaster portion.
I sent mine back, replacing it with the waitress recommendation of the \"house\" special: the cabbage roll. Bahhhh, the horror: dry, heavily peppered meat with to much rice wrapped in a tasteless cabbage leaf.
Don't even get me started on the thick doughy Pierogi :(

Shame on this place and shame on the person in the kitchen calling them self a cock!"}
{"text":"really good goulash. came for a casual dinner with my lady and enjoyed homestyle cooking at a very reasonable price point. totally satisfying comfort food, and really nice service. also some very cool original art on the walls."}
{"text":"Food was alright, but the terrible service ruined it for us. The kitchen took an hour to make our schnitzel and cabbage roll, and the waiter seemed to hesitant to check in with us afterwards. Also, don't take someone who is eastern-European unless what want to hear them talk about how their babushka \"wouldn't even eat this cabbage roll\""}
{"text":"A cute little spot that has opened for about a year and half. Music is good and the food was delicate. I ordered a cucumber salad and the beef/vegetable stew. They were really good!! I would definitely come here again and recommend it to my friends!"}
{"text":"I've actually been following their food truck for years and was so excited to learn they were finally opening a location in Toronto. We went around lunch time so there wasn't too many guests and we got their lunch menu which had a lot of great meal offers. I chose the two pierogies plate and side soup and was not disappointed. The soup of the day was a cabbage and bacon soup. Ugh, it was so good and since yesterday was quite a cold day in December it definitely hit the spot! My two pierogy plates were bacon and potato and cheese and potato. What I like about their pierogies is they fry them so they have a light crunch to them. The prices were also impressive. The whole meal cost me $18 including a nice tip! The service was fine. She was very down to earth, attentive and super friendly. I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We were at the polish festival today and had the jerk chicken perogies from the saucy perogies food stand on the street for lunch.  My partner and I both found them to be good.  At dinner time four of us decided to check out the storefront location.   This was a mistake.  

The waitress brought us pretzels and mustard which was very good.    I LOVE mustard so it was a great start for me.  The four of us ordered a diet coke each.   It came to the table flat and warmish.    We saw the waitress quickly pour a bit of coke over ice into each glass.  It foamed lots and she just added more pop and the foam broke.  We didn't complain but we accepted warmish flattened diet coke to drink.  3 cans of coke became our 4 servings!   

I ordered the perogies (1.order of Bacon potatoe and another order of cheese potatoe)  the perogies were just ok.   I've had much better at the take away counter at starsky's grocery store.  So my meal was warm flat soda and moderate perogies.  

Roland had the pork schnitzel which was absolutely hard as a rock and contained very very little meat.  It was a culinary feat to be able to make such a thin piece of meat so hard and dry.  He was unimpressed.  The smashed potatoes that came with this meal were very good.  (Better tasting than the filling in my perogies)    

Michael had the chicken schnitzel which looked good.  It was a big piece of chicken that was properly cooked.   It came with the same very good potatoes as listed above. 

Sandra had the cabbage roll.  She didn't say too much about it.   It was average tasting but large in size.   

When the waitress asked roland how his food was and he said it has tough and dry she didn't say much.  She walked away and didn't return to the table except to bring a debit machine when she noted we were done eating

Overall I was excited to try the restaurant after being at the saucy perogies mobile site.   It was a let down.   We all decided we would not go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, wandering along Dundas W looking for a place to eat. We chose this one because it looked empty and we thought we'd get food faster as well. Turns out it was also quite delicious! The pirogies here are really good! Between the four us us, we ordered almost all the different pirogies they offered. My favourite was the duck pirogi! Service was great, the restaurant is spacious. I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"Had my company Christmas party here last night and was very impressed! The place is very cozy, and the food and the staff were outstanding (especially the bartender Chris I believe his name was). My only complaint was that they don't charge as much as they should be! The prices are way too low for the quality of food you get. I will definitely be back, and tell my friends."}
{"text":"Came here last week and it was sad.  Food is too salty and pricy.  The service is abrupt and cold.  Wanted to enjoy it but would have been better going to 7-11 and microwaving some perogies."}
{"text":"Saucy Pierogi is all set to help the lowly pierogi get all jazzed up and respectable. Here they are hand made and tailored to your tastes. I had the traditional potato and bacon and they were perfect! Nice al dente outside and creamy soft filling of potato. Delicious.
I also had one of their cabbage rolls as well and it was quite a good size. One of them would be all you need along with something else. These are heavy on the meat rather than the ones that contain more cabbage and rice than meat. Still very good. 
The restaurant has a lively modern feel, rather than a stodgy European atmosphere with an attractive bar. The service was excellent and they even offered us a shot of some delicious apple flavoured vodka at the end of our excellent meal. They have some good beers on tap as well. I noticed a young family eating there and realized that is an affordable family restaurant as well as a cool spot to dine with friends. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yum! Fanciest pierogies I've ever had.  I'm more of a Chinese dumpling guy, but, I enjoyed these.  We came here during a quiet weekday lunch, and that was great.  Very relaxing.

I think we had a lunch combo, and I remember choosing the crab pierogi with that to capitalize on the most expensive one being in a combo.  In the end, my favourite ended up being the traditional cheddar & potato.

We enjoyed them so much, we bought a couple packs from their freezer.  We'd come back."}
{"text":"The Saucy Pierogi was a fantastic experience! Everything we had was delicious, but the pierogies are the main attraction as you would expect. My favourite were the meatball pierogies -- the sauce is just perfect. The bacon and potato pierogies were a close second as the toppings complemented the pierogies very well. Honourable mentions go to the pulled pork and cheddar and potato pierogies. Really, everything we tried on the menu was great though. For example, the polish meat board was a great choice to mix things up.

There's a nice selection of local beers on tap, but the vodka selection is what really stands out. If you're going to spend an evening eating pierogies, you need to indulge in a couple shots of vodka for the full experience. 

Otherwise, it's a decent-sized space with a cozy atmosphere and the service was friendly and attentive during our entire stay. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Have a craving for comfort food? This is the place to go! There's pierogies, cabbage rolls, schnitzel sliders, soups and more. Pricing on food and drinks is very reasonable.

My favourite are the Potato & Cheddar pierogies...a close runner up is the Braised Beef. For vegetarians, there are also Spinach & Feta in addition to my fav. You get 4 per order, so you might have room for a delicious salad or soup. Both are excellent! The Cucumber Salad is my fav!

We had a large group. I made reservations and they accommodated us easily. The service was excellent. This is place is good for large or small groups.

It's a great family owned business! You should go!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place ever since I moved into the neighbourhood. This was my first time trying pierogis (other than the frozen kind) and I loved it!! Portion size was perfect for me, and the cabbage rolls were glorious. Atmosphere is nice and bright, food was served beautifully. I would absolutely come again."}
{"text":"The best Polish contribution to Canada since Wayne Gretzky? Perhaps a bit over the top, but even as an Alberta boy, I wasn't ready for how great this place was.

First (and here's a tip) was my free salad due to the Yelp app. Nothing wrong with arugula, feta, and beets together, especially when it's at its freshest. 

Naturally, I was going to opt for some pierogies. I was a bit skeptical of the dark arts of mixing traditional pierogies with non-traditional fillings. I couldn't opt for a pierogi filled with kimchi, but one stuffed with braised beef was approachable. It was delicious, and in spite of being a filling, they didn't opt for the beef being cheap. I also went for the cheesy bacon ones. No surprise there, that they were so good I almost had to brace myself before each bite. Oh, and they were indeed saucy.

I split some dishes, so I was also able to try a few things. Loved the sausage, and it was the sweeter kielbasa style one. Done over a grill too, and not only boiled. The cabbage roll was MASSIVE and tasted great. My one criticism would be that it needed to be heated more however.

Still they hit it out of the park with most of the other dishes, and it was some of the best service I've experienced in some time. Great layout too for large groups if needed.

Like Wayne, The Saucy Pierogi is also a 'great one',"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like pierogi? 

Nice variety of boozy beverages and small list of  non alcoholic ones.

We ordered the cheese and potato and bacon and potato pierogi and the pork schnitzel.  The pierogies were a thicker dough than what I usually like but you could tell they were home made and delicious.  The schnitzel was disappointing in that it was overcooked and dry.  The accompanying potatoes were tasty but the saurkraut was too dry for my liking.

Great friendly service and a positive experience overall!"}
{"text":"It was a saucy day in T-Oh and we had a large group in at the TSP.  They handled us like a charm!  Super accommodating, especially the pain of having to deal with a large group.

Food was fantastic as I had a 4-way (trading pierogi's with 3 other people) to get a chance to sample almost everything off their Pierogi menu.  My personal fav would be the duck, but I'm a duck whore.

Managed to also sneak in bites from everyone around me, and it all seemed pretty fantastic.

I will make like Arnold.. (I'll be back)"}
{"text":"This place has a mix of pierogi in different ways.  I mean they have your standard cheddar and potato that come with a melted cheese and bacon topping (yum) and then they get a little adventurous with ones that have kimchi and others that have crab.  

So it's not your traditional Polish type with kraut (unless it comes with kimchi) or hot and cold borscht and bigos but there's a menu with a few choices that should appeal to just about anybody.  

For the mains there are choices like cabbage rolls, schnitzel (chicken or pork) and for one of the more expensive things on the menu (barely 13 bucks) they have a goulash on potato pancake type thing.  I've had something like that before on Roncesvalles at Polonia.

While the pierogi come in servings of 4 the mains are a decent sized plate and they start at about 9 bucks for the kielbasa while the schnitzel plates while not huge are a great size and are barely 10 bucks, about the same for the cabbage rolls.  The prices here are really good value considering it's a sit down place and you can get a main and a side of pierogi (yes I like variety) for about 15 dollars a person.  

Besides the food being good value the place also has soups and salads for those not looking for the usually heavier eastern European fare. 

I like this place and it had a nice dining area.  We were over a dozen and they were able to handle our party on a Friday no problem.  

I had 2 pitchers of beer, bought another beer for a friend, an order of cheddar and potato pierogi and chicken schnitzel as my main.  For checking in we received a complimentary soup or salad as well.  After tax it came out barely over 65 dollars.  I guarantee I had the highest bill at the table but that's only because I ordered 2 pitchers of draft (18 bucks each).  The food is quite well done and at a very reasonable price as well."}
{"text":"Avoid this restaurant at all costs.  My husband ordered a chicken schnitzel and it turned into  a bit of a horror story.  After taking a couple of bites of the schnitzel he realized that the chicken meat under the breading is completely RAW.  The waitress apologized and brought us another schnitzel, but needless to say we are never going back there again.

{"text":"So underwhelming. :( I'm Ukrainian & expect a good perogie. 3 per order for $6 is pretty outrageous, however, we were there for perogies so, when in Rome... . We ordered spinach & feta, chorizo, bacon & cheddar, and cheddar potato. The former are NOT perogies, sorry. They tasted okay but spinach filling & chorizo/ground beef filling does not a perogie make. Why not make them all potato & vary just the toppings? The other two were proper perogies but the potato inside was runny/wet & the cheese sauce was a slightly improved version of Velveeta. The bacon was charred beyond recognition. I also shared the Polish Sausage plate. That was fairly good but nothing Baba's going to make. There wasn't even a full kielbasa piece or slice of rye & it was $12! We had a cocktail each (good but very strong) & our bill was $90 with tax & tip!!  Bye bye Saucy Pierogi, no more visits from this girl. Looks like the neighbourhood is onto you too as it was pretty dead for 8pm on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"During the day the place is very bright and welcoming for a lunch, but at night the lighting is dimmed and the place actually had a slightly romantic yet casual vibe. Lots of 2 or 4 person seated high tops in the front, and more cozy booth styled seats closer to the back. From an atmosphere perspective, I have no complaints.

As for food and drinks:
Beer selection is miinimal but good for what they do have, with Beau's and Amsterdam Cruiser IPA on tap for $8 a pop.
Pork schnitzel sliders ($8) come with 2 per order and were quite tasty. Admittedly even better once adding hot sauce. Jerk chicken pierogi's ($6) were not bad, but not really memorable by any means and at $2 each the value isn't really there.

I think this place would be best going and ordering a large variety of pierogies and getting more sampling going on. As a 1 on off diner, I was appeased but not necessarily impressed.
3 stars."}
{"text":"First time I've been to a specialty pierogi restaurant and boy am I impressed! Its owned by a delightful Polish family and friends. All of their pierogis are packed with content and the skin is different from what I've tasted before. It's not grainy when chewing it up because they use regular instead of potato flour. Very soft.

APPETIZERS:
Tomato Salad - tomatoes, ontario feta, roasted garlic shallot vinaigrette ~$5.96
these are the freshest and sweetest tomatoes I've ever had. I really like this salad

Creamy Cucumber Salad - cucumbers, sour cream dill dressing ~$3.95
Has a very grassy and distinct taste. cucumbers are nice and juicy with a light creamy dressing. 

PIEROGIS:
Cheddar & Potato -old cheddar, lager sauce, sour cream, green onion, bacon ~$5.95/4 pieces
Tastes like a good ol traditional pierogi with a little extra. A great guilty pleasure!

Duck - beets, watermelon dressing, daikon radish slaw ~$7.95
My absolute favourite of all of them. I wouldn't have ordered it by looking at the ingredients itself, but was convinced because it had duck in it xD Everything goes well together.

Spinach & Feta  - feta, house-made tzatziki, crumbled feta, parsley ~$6.95
This pierogi was 95% spinach. The inside was fully loaded with spinach (with no air pockets) and it was delish 

Baised Beef Shank - gravy, parsley, pickle ~$6.95
The gravy was savoury and reminds me of thick Sidekick/Swiss Chalet sauce (in a good way). The beef was a little gamey though. They re-added this onto the menu after summer.

COURSES:
Goulash & Potato Pancake - beef & red pepper stew, caramelized onions, sour cream ~$12.95
Being one of their newer menu items, I didn't find the goulash very memorable, but it was comforting with its warmness. The dish was salvaged by the potato pancake, though very thin.

Braised Duck Kopytka - polish gnocchi-style potato dumpling with braised duck and duck gravy ~$14.95
the gnocchi texture is spot on. I recommend this over the goulash

Also their Prosecco hibiscus lavender lemon cocktail is AMAZING. Went well with the pierogis

I think their vegetarian-dominated pierogis stand out ie. Spinach & Feta and Duck. They used locally-sourced ingredients which is probably why even the salad tastes super fresh. If it weren't for the sauce, eating the meat alone would be a tad too dry.

{"text":"Though usually empty, this place is fantastic. Great food, and in perfect portions for a snack or meal, which is great because I eat like a bird, and it means I can get delicious dinner for $6. Pretty nice bar, it could totally be a good place to get drinks if it wasn't awkward to say \"Hey friends, let's go have some drinks at the Saucy Pierogi\"
They're always changing the menu, so even if pierogis aren't your thing, there's generally other good eastern european food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious with a great atmosphere! I highly recommend trying the poutine pierogi. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  

The nice thing is that each order comes with 4 pierogies which makes it great for sharing.  Trust me you will want to keep ordering and will definitely be coming back for more. Not only is the food exceptional they also have some great beers - especially if you are a craft beer aficionado.  

I also recommend joining their facebook group, they are constantly doing beer tastings and also have some amazing specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"Amazing food in an understatement. Everything on the menu is just so good. The staff are friendly and welcoming and even went to extra mile by running down the street chasing after me when I accidentally left my phone.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had a business luncheon at Saucy Pierogi and was very pleased. The food was absolutely delicious. Best Pierogis I have ever tasted. Decor was comfortable with nice atmosphere. Good tunes and icy cold Beau's pints. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Tasted like someone who was not Eastern European and knew nothing about making pierogies tried to specialize in pierogies. Also I couldn't tell if I was cutting through my schnitzel or rubber. Service was nice though."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at saucy pierogi, loved at atmosphere. I had ordered one of the night special duck pierogi with pulled pork pierogi, arugula/beets salad, and the Chicken schnitzel dinner. 

It was my first time having pierogis and I thought it was great. My main concern is that the schnitzel could of been bigger because it should of been the star of the dish but sadly the mash potato took its place. Also I really wish some of the dishes could of been a bit bigger.. With that in mind you might have to order a bit more to fill you up if you have a big appetite. Service was nice A+"}
{"text":"I love dumplings in all forms but there is something special about chewy pockets of dough filled with potato and cheese and smothered with onions, bacon, green onion and sour cream. Yes I am talking about the beloved pierogi. This Eastern European comfort food has found its way into the bellies of many North Americans and luckily for us here in Toronto, there is a restaurant that specializes in pierogies and other traditional Polish dishes.

The Saucy Pierogi has been around since 2013, starting off as a pop-up restaurant at many of the food festivals around the GTA. After gaining great success at these events, Warsaw brothers Paul and Konrad Obara, opened the doors to their official Saucy Pierogi restaurant located in the Dundas West neighbourhood. The cozy restaurant features a variety of handmade pierogies with authentic fillings such as potato and cheese as well as innovative fillings like pulled pork and spinach and feta. Besides the lovable pierogi, The Saucy Pierogi also features other Eastern European comfort foods such as schnitzel, goulash and cabbage rolls. The beverage selection consists of craft beer, frozen vodka and seasonal cocktails. 

The restaurant recently celebrated it's one year anniversary earlier this month and unveiled new menu items to commemorate. The new menu features 3 new-school pierogi's filled with braised beef shank, rock crab and duck. They have also added some Eastern European classics such as beef goulash served over a potato pancake, a rendition of barszcz soup (beet broth with Polish style tortellini) and Kopytka which is braised duck over Polish-style gnocchi. Here are some of the menu items I tried: 

Duck Pierogi with Sweet & Sour Soy Sauce and Daikon Radish Slaw - $7.95
Braised Beef Shank Pierogi with Gravy, Parsley and a Pickle - $6.95
Cheddar & Potato Pierogi with Cheese Sauce, Green Onion, Sour Cream & Bacon - $5.95
Spinach & Feta Pierogi with Tzatziki, Crumbled Feta and Parsley - $5.95
Tomato Salad with Feta & Balsamic Dressing - $5.95 
Cucumber Salad with Sour Cream Dill Dressing - $3.95
Goulash and Potato Pancake - $12.95 
Braised Duck Kopytka with Polish Style Dumplings - $14.95 (vegetarian option available) 

My favourite items were the cheddar and potato pierogi, the braised beef shank and the spinach and feta. All very tasty with accompanying sauces and garnishes. I also really liked the beef goulash with potato pancake. It was very warming and comforting especially on the dark and rainy night that I visited. The goulash was thick and flavourful, and not heavy on the salt which I appreciate in a stew. There were a few other menu items I didn't get to try but certainly want to go back to for...mainly the the cabbage roll with boiled potatoes and Polish meat board.

What really attracts me to The Saucy Pierogi (other than the fact I'm obsessed with pierogies), is the VERY reasonable prices. You can get a tasty homemade meal here for less than $15, or if you're in a snacking mood there are lots of pierogi and drink specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"I was surprised to walk in on a Wednesday night and be the ONLY table, especially after seeing all the positive reviews. This place was lovely though. It transported me back to some of my favorite childhood dishes that my Polish grandmothers would make. Mmmmmmmm. The pierogis were really well flavored. And the kielbasa was super juicy. Loved the mustard on the side. Lots of savory flavors. The only reason why this place is a 4 and not a 5, is because our waitress wasn't super attentive and we were the only table. We didn't have water the entire meal and she could have checked up on us at least once so we could ask or get more cocktails. That's where it fell short. She was behind the bar maybe busy on her phone and meanwhile should have given us some more attention. I mean with only one freakin table it shouldn't be difficult at all. So that's the only downside. Food and cocktails were awesome. Just get your service together."}
{"text":"Pretty decent perogies! I know it's in the heart of \"Little Poland\" so I should have expected as much, but the price and portions were decent. Maybe one day they'll deliver, so I can shameless eat half the menu in the comfort of my own home"}
{"text":"I really, really like pierogis. I've been buying frozen ones at my local grocer and ordering them off of any menu they appear on for as long as I can remember. 

I am a goddamn expert at dipping food in sour cream.

I say with certainty: I know that their potato pierogis covered in cheese and bacon are legit. My husband was really keen on their meatball pierogis, too, but I'm a purist, so I will never know his joy."}
