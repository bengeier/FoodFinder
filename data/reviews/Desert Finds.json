{"text":"This company provided me with an exceptional estate sale experience.  I found Dave & Mary to be quite professional and knowledgeable.   I would recommend their services to anyone who finds themselves with the unpleasant task of disposing of a house full of property."}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars... I would. It was THAT BAD! Their website is a complete lie. They were rude, had no tact, and absolutely no sympathy. They came for a \"consultation\" and gave about 30 seconds of their time before they shoved a card in my face. completely rude. unprofessional. I wish I would have read these reviews earlier... I trusted their website and I shouldnt have! Those 5 star reviews are obviously their friends or something! Listen to these personal reviews while you still can. I was lucky enough to get out before I committed to  a sale."}
{"text":"She arrived 30 minutes early. I pulled up and she's sitting there in her fancy car. I didn't have a good feeling.  We went inside my home, I showed her through the estate and she said at the end of the tour, I can't do this.  I'm allergic to cats. I can call someone else for you if you'd like. OK. I'll call from my car.  I haven't heard from anyone! After reading the review I'll consider this a blessing! These people are a fricken joke!!!!"}
{"text":"Desert Finds is a company that should be charged with criminal offenses in my opinion. They are untrustworthy and deceitful in a cunning way. They ask you to not be at the \"Estate Sale\" to avoid any second thoughts about selling your items.  In my opinion this is their way of making sure you do not see what is happening in reality.  We were told that there would be a staff of people to work the Estate Sale.  We were told that at the end of the process we could donate items to a charity of our choice. We were told that they were number 1 in the valley.  We were told that they had vast experience in pricing items. We had quite a few items, furniture (Sofas, Chairs, antique armoire, small dining table, chairs, office desks, etc.). We also had quite a few decorating items (Horse Head sculpture, pictures, assorted small tables, etc.).  All told these items were valued at approximately $15K.    When it was all over I went over to the house and found piles of clothes, books, tapes, etc. in the trash and piled around the trash can.  Nothing was let for us to give to charity since it was sold on a \"buy out\".  Let me explain what that is...a \"buy out\" is where someone comes in at the end of the day and offers to buy everything left.  My neighbors told us that a truck pulled up at the end of the day and most of our belongings went out the door and onto this truck...the \"but out\" dollar amount was $150.  Hundreds if not thousands of dollars of belongings were essentially stolen! The Sculpture mentioned earlier was valued at $800...on Sale for $200 and was part of the \"Buy Out\".    There is a fiduciary trust that is placed in a company to do the right thing. Desert Finds has no clue what those words mean!  I plan on contacting the State Attorney General Office and may look to press charges against this so called number 1 rated company."}
