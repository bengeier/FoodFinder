{"text":"There food is so good and home style they made my friend from Ecuador cry for her mama. Thank you guys yall where so sweet and your food was amazing wish yall where open all week ."}
{"text":"We had the pernil and rice and unlike previous yelpers the rice was moist and very tasty and the meat was salted just right. Also the tostones were nice and thick. The tripleta sandwich was also seasoned just right and the bread was on point, it was thick but not soggy even though we got our food to go. The sauce that came on the side was really good too.  The only things we didn't care for was the only drink selection was water and empanadillas could use a little more meat in them. But for the taste and value we will return often. Especially when they add the rellenos de papas my favorite.  For a new business they are doing it right and of course still learning and growing so they can only get better but have very little to improve. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Great food and great owners! We ordered the pollo, carne and pizza empanadas, the jibarito, and the tripleta. All were amazing and we are so glad we finally have a Puerto Rican spot in the valley!"}
{"text":"Excellent Puertorican food. Excited to see and tastes some tasteful uncommon food in phoenix. Great customer services with a smile. Definitely a new fan I am."}
{"text":"The three stars are for the food. Two stars could have been earned had they had a complete menu!  We went in the afternoon and only had ONE SANDWICH. The sandwich we tried was made with plantains instead of bread with a pork filler. It was good. We tried their red beans and rice (complimentary since they didn't have much else) and it was delicious.  If i make a trip to get to ur truck i expect to try ur whole menu!!!!!  Come on guys!!! Let's get with it.  Nice meeting you.  Will try u again so i can taste mofongo and arroz con gandules.  Hope i get to!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most amazingly delicious Puerto Rican food in AZ!! From the rich decadent flan (you can't just eat one, seriously!) to the hearty beef and chicken empanadillas, you can't go wrong with ANYTHING you choose from their menu!! Seriously, make room and try them all!! Not only is the food amazing, but the owners, Juan and Alex, are phenomenal people. Love Phoenix Coqui!!   - Mikki"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try their food for so long and finally last night I was able to go and let me tell you, I was not disappointed.  Welcomed with all smiles, friendly owners, these guys made me feel I was back home kicking it after hours waiting for my tripleta.  The food was amazing, had the chicken and beef empanada and omg  wish I would've gotten more, tasted just like the ones in Maunabo and patillas.  Meat had so much flavor! Had the white rice with chicken and a tripleta as well, loved it all.  Highly recommended, price is very just for the amount of food.  Come out and support, where else can you get great food till 2am?! Xoxo love you guys!"}
{"text":"This is currently my favorite food truck in the Valley. Everything I've tried so far has been such a treat for my tastebuds - the arroz con gandules, the pernil (in two versions: con habichuelas, and as the filling for jibarito), the pollo guisado, the empanadillas, the bacalaitos (codfish fritters ... tip: buy several and freeze some so you can pop them in the toaster oven when the bacalaito craving hits).  My favorite dish from this food truck is the  mofongo con camaron - garlicky mashed plantains with bits of chicharron, with succulent shrimps in a savory sauce.   High restaurant quality food prepared by some of the friendliest food truck people you could ever meet!"}
{"text":"The service was very nice however, they need a little work. The tripleta sandwich was too salty, the beef meat that they use did not work with the other flavor of the sandwich. The flan had too much cheese in the mixture and made it too hard , it was like eating a piece of cream cheese and not enough caramel. Flan without caramel is not flan. I hope that you receive this comment to help you make the necessary changes to be a great experiencia for the people that needs a little piece of home. Thank you."}
{"text":"The best Puerto Rican food in the valley ..  also amazing customer service ...  my recommendation is the traditional plate"}
{"text":"Adventurous. I met a new friend here that was excited to show me what Puerto Rican food was all about (she is Puerto Rican and I am a PR food virgin). I was driving around for awhile and then talked to some people at a local bar that explained it was a food truck. It all started to make sense. My friend showed up and made some suggestions on what I should try. I typically don't eat beef so I ended up with this interesting sandwich that is made from plantains to make buns. It was really good. But then the owners came out of the van and had us try these sweet plantains and those were really really good. I also tried this strange soda that almost tasted like molasses. All in all, great experience and amazingly friendly staff."}
{"text":"So good. Got the chicken and beef empanadillas and LOVED them. Nice staff, fun vibe. Awesome."}
{"text":"What can I say? Having found a food truck with Puerto Rican food took me back to when we lived in Fajardo and Saturdays we went to the beach and the authentic snacks and sandwiches we bought there. The jibarito is very very good, it is a plaintain sandwich with seasoned mayo and tender beef. Served with either arroz con gandules or french fries. Yum!. I ordered empanadillas which are fritters with cheese and tripleta fries. All of our food was freshly prepared and tasted delicious. The price is very reasonable and the taste is delicious. The best part is the open late! Woohoo. Our new late night merienda place. Will definitely be back. A plus....Owner's are awesome and super friendly!"}
{"text":"There are not a lot of options for Puerto Rican food in Phoenix, especially late night. Phoenix Coqui has only been open for a couple of months now and can be found in the Melrose neighborhood at a couple of the bars located on 7th Avenue. Everything about Phoenix Coqui was 5 stars the food, the service, and friendly owners. We tried all of the empanadillas the beef, chicken and pizza. We were surprised by how good the pizza one was! We also tried the Jibarito and the Tripleta, both were fantastic but I'd give the slight edge to the Tripleta. The owners also gave us a sample size of the their arroz con gandules which we are definitely ordering next time we go!"}
{"text":"Alexis and his crew provided top-notch service at our recent conference of 150 people. Everybody loved their food and most went back for seconds and thirds. They were on time for everything, very attentive, and a pleasure to work with."}
{"text":"Hacen un mofongo sabroso, las empanadas con pap√°s fritas y mayoketshup exquisitas.  El flan de queso o el tembleque para chuparse los dedos"}
{"text":"This review is for the grand opening of their food truck. Let me start by saying that as a fellow puertorrican, I would like this guys to succeed, they have a good concept, truck looked awesome and the crew energy was really high. The truck was packed with a nice line of people, and they took care of the orders very fast. So let start with the good stuff, the rice, beans and pork was good and price right, El Jibarito and the beef empanadilla were good as well. The dough for the empanadilla was on point. Now these are the things that would need improvement, the Tripleta was too salty, I was not able to take more that 4 bites, the chicken was good but the beef was not, the bread could be better too so pretty much all the Tripleta ended in the trash can.  The flan texture was a bit strange like too dry and very cheesy (technically not a bad thing) needed at little bit more of the caramel. So those were the misses. I'll update my review once I give them a second try, I got a feeling that they could do better."}
{"text":"I'll start off with the food was AMAZING!!! It was a super cold night, but one of the owners still came out and spoke to us while we waited for our food! You can tell they really care about the food and their customers! We will become regulars quickly!"}
{"text":"Phoenix Coqui is Phoenix's first Puerto Rican food truck! As a native to the East Coast, I'm so glad that I finally get a chance to satisfy my PR cravings. \"Coqui\" is actually a type of singing frog in Puerto Rico, and the truck sports a symbol of the frog on its outside. We wanted to order the Tripleta, a type of all meats sandwich and the guy ahead of us in line got the last one! Alas, we ordered chicken and pizza empanadas, and both were tasty. The casing of the empanada was crisp and easy to bite into, and the chicken had a gracious amount. Both empanadas were made to order, so the food was piping hot and fresh to taste. Now I know that if I need my Puerto Rican cravings fixed, I can go find them. My only tip is to keep in mind that they are a fairly new food truck, they just opened last month, so they have a limited amount of menu items. (I'll be sure to try the Tripleta next time.)"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. A Puerto Rican coming from NY I expect a big blast of flavor and I didn't get that, it was a little bland but I am willing to give it another try for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer services, and their portions are large.  I'm a regular here and highly recommend this awesome food truck."}
