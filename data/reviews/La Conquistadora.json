{"text":"Très frais et authentique, ce petit restaurant se trouve un peu à l'extérieur du centre ville dans un petit rez-de-chaussé. J'y suis allé un vendredi vers 19h et c'était plein à craquer. J'ai particulièrement aimé le Salpicon et le dessert."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall had such amazing food! Fresh guacamole, divine burritos, and the service was lovely!"}
{"text":"Great little place with fast and friendly service for those looking for authentic Mexican food. The proprietor started out in Surrey BC with a similar restaurant so there is plenty of experience in doing it right. I can vouch for the Enchiladas washed down with a Tamarind beverage. And don't forget to try their very own unique pastry called Sonrisa de Gloria which is absolutely delicious. I rate the value as 'good' for the money but the food is great. Give it a try."}
{"text":"There is so few \"ethnic\" restaurants in the Laurentides I could beg for more.  I have been eying this Mexican place since... Forever telling myself I would go when my craving for Mexican food would be intolerable and last Saturday, in the heat of summer after a few beer on a terrasse. It felt like we needed Mexican food.  At first, we were pleased to see the interior. It felt authentic, the lady who served us was a charm, sweet and refreshing like her margaritas. But then, arrived the chimichanga and the burritos.  :(  They were covered in white sauce and they were clearly made ahead. They were mainly made of rice, reheated dry rice. The overall feel of the plates was bland and forgettable. I could not taste any spices. Not as in \"hot\" spice but as in flavoured.  I would have gived this place a 2 stars. But the lady was really nice and I can entrain the idea that maybe... I hate to say this... But maybe the locals are not used to Mexican spices so that's why it's so blend...  If I go back, I probably only take tortilla and margaritas."}
{"text":"Pour être franche, ce n'est pas la meilleure place pour gouter à l'authenticité mexicaine. Il manque de choix au niveau du menu. Qualité prix laisse à désirer!"}
{"text":"The waiter was helpful and my chimichanga was Great. The prices were great. I couldn't eat the whole thing because it's big (To Go plate) But I might have eaten something different but the menu is only in French and Spanish. I can't read either. So I went with what was familiar. But good choice. Will come again."}
{"text":"I was told about this place so decided to try it for myself. I tried the beef enchiladas both with red sauce & with the mole sauce. I preferred to mole very tasty. The refried beans were a winner to. My son tried the burrito and he enjoyed to. The homemade nachos were very good to begin the meal. We also tried the quesadilla it was ok nothing special. You need to try their Tomatio hot sauce so tasty I put it everywhere. The service was fast but it was a very warm evening and their A/C is not suitable for the space so it was very hot inside. Over all a nice local family  run place that keeps it real."}
{"text":"Fabulous Mexican food with El Salvador spin. Family owned. You can tell they really care about the food and their customers.   There is a small patio for those wanting to sit outside. It's on one of the quiet streets. The parking lot is small but so is the place, so it's probably adequate for the customer flow they have.   The food is very simple and authentic. They stay true to the tradition, not trying to modernize or westenize their menu (cudos to them for that).  We tried several things on their menu but their Barbacoa (pork) burrito was the best -- was also recommended to us by the waiter (I think she is the owner's daughter).   We were very happy to find this place."}
