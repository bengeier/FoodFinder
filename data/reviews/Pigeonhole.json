{"text":"Delicious and flavourful. You can tell each dish has been poured on with love and meticulousness of artisans. They are served in small quantities but are meant to be shared, or not. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed with the arrogance of the staff. Raw fish, regardless of its nature should never smell and taste \"fishy\". When we politely pointed this out and the staff politely took it away, all was good. Things quickly fell apart when we were reminded three times that the calamari was supposed to smell \"fishy\". The fishy issue is somewhat inconsequential at this point, the need to correct your customer is not."}
{"text":"Pigeonhole is mostly about well prepared small shareable plates and drinks to accompany them. As its name implies though, Pigeonhole's food doesn't fit neatly into one cuisine. We sat on the patio and ordered the halibut cheeks, tuna crudo, ricotta dumplings, and the chicken liver mousse, along with several cocktails.   First off, the cocktails we had (they change regularly) were nicely balanced and a pretty good deal as they are in the $13 range but contain up to 3oz of liqueur. The wine menu is moderately extensive especially for by-the-glass options, and covers the gamut of grapes & styles from smaller producers.   The first dish to come was the mousse, which scored points for flavour and texture, but was perhaps a bit small for sharing, especially if there were more than two people in your party.  The ricotta dumplings were beautifully delicate, with a tasty mushroom sauce we were sure to eat up. While the dumpling is a staple here, like many dishes it appears to undergo ingredient tweaking to use whatever's fresh & available. The halibut cheeks for example came with miner lettuce (which has a unique shape and taste), but all of the pics we've seen if it before or since use different greens. The cheeks were very well made, lightly poached with a melt in your mouth texture.   Finally, the tuna crudo had a nice firm texture, and was well complimented by an out of the ordinary chermoula, a North African spice mix with cumin, parsley and warm spices that is often served with fish there. A bit more starch accompaniment would have stretched the dish out a bit. We skipped dessert as two options didn't interest us (madeleines are a coffee accessory, not a dessert). We left culinarily satisfied but a little hungry after dropping just over $100 on 4 plates and 4 cocktails.   Overall, Pigeonhole has tasty, well-prepared shareable small plates but my enthusiasm (are rating) is tempered by a lack of starch to provide a complete meal experience which you'd expect for the prices paid."}
{"text":"Didn't get food.. But oh my god the drinks. I looked at the menu and it consisted of extensive wines, many beers and 5 cocktails.. We came for the cocktails so it was a little confusing. We ordered a first round off the menu and they were amazing. Our server came around again and asked him about our second round and he was so helpful and suggested cocktails that were not on the menu based on what we liked. Such a good experience, amazing drinks, and very helpful and knowledgable servers. It's a mainstay on 17th ave based on the drinks alone."}
{"text":"Extremely impressive restaurant. The best restaurant experience I've ever had in Calgary, and one of the best I've had period (including Michelin star restaurants).  We ordered four items for two people. The dishes come out one at a time, at a good pace. Every single dish was absolutely wonderful, and the portions are perfect. In particular I recommend the haloumi dish and the linguini. Price was suitably high, but the quality is so good that it doesn't feel overpriced. If you're in Calgary, you must go at least once."}
{"text":"Was in town on business, and Air Canada's Enroute magazine had recommended this restaurant, and we were able to make a reservation on Open Table.  The restaurant was roughly a half hour walk from the Westin hotel to work up our appetite;  when we got to 17th Avenue, we found a restaurant strip, with lots of interesting choices to note for the next visit to Calgary.  Pigeonhole itself wasn't signed very obviously, but we kinda figured out that we were likely at the right place, and a hostess just happened to walked out, to welcome us into a spacious dining room.  Our table for 2 was ready, and near the opened window to the balcony, so it was not too hot (it happened to be a hot day).  The menu was explained to us, and the server recommended 2-3 plates per person to share.  We ordered the Tuna, the Salmon Crudo, the Nectarine salad, the Charred Cabbage, the Dumplings and the Duck.  Of these, while everything was delicious, I would say the Nectarine salad and the charred cabbage especially stood out, because they were a little more unique and not readily found in other restaurants I've frequented.  I've already explored recipes for charring cabbage since returning home.  And, the Nectarine salad was so good we debated having it again for dessert!  But there was actually a nectarine dessert so we opted for that instead.    All this, along with a couple of cocktails, came to $125 before tip.  Coming from Toronto, this is very good value.  We were full, but not stuffed (so that we could still walk back to the hotel).  It has been a while since I'd been to Calgary, and it's great to see and experience the burgeoning restaurant scene in Calgary.  The only downside, and this has nothing to do with the restaurant or the food, is that 17th Avenue must be where people like to be seen?  More than once, cars and motorcycles revved their engines as they raced past the restaurant, which was highly annoying during the meal!"}
{"text":"Holy a-lot-of-swear-words, this place just knocked my socks off. Service? Great. Decor? Adorably quaint and cozy and tasteful. Food? DELICIOUS. Tartare was amazeballs. Beets rocked my world. Broccolini killed it. Crepes were good. Dessert tasted as creative and yummy as it looked. Wine list is beautiful. I don't even want to tell people about how amazing it was because I want to keep it all to myself. However that's   insanely unfair to the chef and the staff and as much as it pains me to share this delectable secret, I must spread the gospel. I. Love. Pigeonhole. New favourite. Hands down."}
{"text":"Was I excited about opening night at Pigeonhole? You bet! There is some serious Calgary talent attached to this new restaurant and everything about our time spent there was perfect. When you walk in, you can see the beautiful bar where the bartenders make some mad cocktails (try the Earl Grey Martini I am begging you!) then beyond that, the chefs working diligently in the exposed kitchen, complete with a legit hibachi grill and long prep table. What they are creating, my friends, is magic on a plate. Ingredients you never would have thought to put together somehow meld into a cacophony of flavours which work their way from your mouth to your brain. What? Sorry for the cheese... Speaking of cheese. Try the ugly duckling dish (talk about pigeonholing a dish..) of halloumi, pickled rhubarb, celery (the 'it' vegetable of 2015!), olives, and Pistachio pur√©e. In all we tried 6/16 available dishes.  -Chickpea Panisse -Hallomi  -Nettle Dumplings with morels and peas. Wow. I have literally not stopped thinking about this dish since Friday. How DO they do it? -Nori Crumpets with Shrimp Butter...Buttah!! -Salted Halibut Perogies with ramps -Edamame in Salty Butter with Rabbit Sausage- the perfect dish as far as I'm concerned.  I'm sure we could have ordered more and been totally satisfied. I'm not sure anyone can say this is a place to have dinner...but I would love to return with a larger group and order the entire menu! And if you are into wine, you have plenty to choose from. Every dish was spot on. The service was spot on (Hi Heather!). Do yourself a favour and make a reservation for Pigeonhole today."}
{"text":"Went for birthday dinner in a Thursday and had a good experience. They were very accommodating when we asked to sit at the bar. This was because the two seater they had us originally reserved at was much too cramped with ppl on both sides of us. The Bartender gave the birthday girl a free glass of bubbles. I have a fish allergy and he was also accommodating about that too. He also gave the birthday girl a half order of the octopus which she absolutely loved. All in all good experience with decent food."}
{"text":"I had probably the best meal I've had in Calgary here. Innovative dishes and sharing plates combined with most wines by the glass made this a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful space with great atmosphere with some really solid food. Pigeonhole feels like that magical unicorn of a restaurant with a wild, innovative menu - except actually everything is freaking delicious.   We sat at the bar and ordered a quick cheese platter with our cocktails, as you do  when seated directly across from a cheese board. Served with a side of honeycomb, preserves and toast, it was exactly what we were after. We went on to share four plates between us which probably wasn't enough as they're pretty small, but we were on our way to a show. I could get into exactly what those plates were but I know the menu has already changed and why put you through that? After my first experience I'd be more than willing to play menu item roulette here.   As with all small plate restaurants, the low prices of the individual plates might make it feel like you're in for a $ night, but those plates can add up to a $$$$ bill quickly. You've been warned.  I look forward to my next trip to this hole."}
{"text":"Food was great, for large plates, chicken was awesome, probably main knock is it's expensive and the small plates add up fast, so just be ready for that when you go. Overall though most of the food we had was awesome."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, fun atmosphere, and delicious food! I probably had the best duck dish ever (besides Peking duck...). The duck is so tender and flavourful, feels like dream. A must try place!"}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews I must have really been here on an off night. I don't know that I have ever had such a combination of poor food, poor service and crowded, unenjoyable atmosphere. Both myself and my friend felt ill afterwards. So disappointing. After such a poor experience I was in shock that this Resteraunt was so highly rated in Calgary. There are many far better places to eat in Calgary, with staff who are welcoming, cheerful and helpful.   We had an oyster mushroom dish that had no oyster mushrooms in it, but full of button mushrooms. Most disappointing and false advertising to say the least. We had some cabbage that initially tasted amazing but was so full of oil or fat that it became inedible after a few bites. Considering the dishes are really only a few bites, this blew that dish into the weeds. Feeling ill after dinner  guaranteed that we won't be back and won't recommend this Resteraunt to others. There are so many better places with better service in this great food city!! Perhaps someone made an error in the voting process that rated Pigeonhole so highly!!"}
{"text":"enRoute magazine named this place Canada's best new restaurant in 2015 - how could I not try this place?  I probably should have clued in that \"snack bar\" in their name not only meant sharing but that portions are small so you are essentially snacking.   That being said, 4 hungry girls there for dinner we racked up our bill quite a bit trying to get full. We were unsuccessful, however that didn't mean we didn't enjoy everything we ordered.  Charred cabbage, halloumi cheese & beet salad, belgian endive, duck leg, calamari and ricotta dumplings all came out on eclectic mismatched china. Everything was scrumptious! The calamari is not the typical breaded kind you expect, and we loved it so much we got a 2nd order (but also, because we were still hungry).  Definitely having lots of room for dessert, we got the buttermilk panna cotta and pot de cr√®me (both served in cutesy tea cups). The pot de cr√®me was quite rich, I'd pass on it but would totally double up on the panna cotta if opportunity arose.   I truly loved the food here, but for the amount I paid AND I still had to head to McDee's after  is a bit bothersome. So maybe next time I eat beforehand, and enjoy a few cocktails and order a few teaser dishes here and there."}
{"text":"Fantastic location, great patio, service was top-notch. The menu has many unique dishes which I haven't seen elsewhere (their friend cauliflower dish - Delicious!) Great spot for my group of 5 girls. Definitely pricey, but the service and quality of the food reflected that. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after the hype I heard. I thought it was good, but not great place overall. The server was a friendly enough guy, but it has started to bug me when these restaurants focus on non-GMO, sustainable, organic as rubber stamps of quality. I was offered to sample any wine on the list before buying a bottle. However, when I asked to do so I was met with \"well all our wines are good, the one you want is organic, non-GMO...blah blah\" then indirect pressure just to buy the bottle. Kind of disappointing. I don't care what kind if methods the winery uses if its good wine, but hey I am not pretentious hipster like that.  The dishes were very good to inedible. Ricotta dumplings and charred cabbage were excellent. Duck leg was good, Angus beef was average, crumpets average, lamb breast was awful. Seriously, it was a solid piece of fat I couldn't chew, totally disgusting. Cheese plate had excellent blue cheese, but the cheddar and Bree were average.  Overall a good not great place that is overhyped. Seeing as I hear that it is related to model milk I am not surprised. They need to turn up the substance and turn down the kitch. Ie: The record player was a cool idea, but would have preferred not to chew the fat."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Interesting choices on the menu, all very tasty.  Do not forget to order some sourdough bread to make sure you can soak up all of the sauces.  They need to have some Lambic fruit beers.  Will definitely return here."}
{"text":"Had a really good anniversary dinner. 3 separate dinning areas, if you have a good size group you want to sit up by the chefs for a good view of the kitchen. All meals were really done well..overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I love Pigeonhole.  It would be a great restaurant in any city in the world. With great energy, happy staff, unique offerings, Pigeonhole has the gracious dining experience down pat.    Starting with cocktails, an Austrian red, we went through the menu like locusts, ordering too much food.  Everything was great, with some items better than others.  Grilled cabbage is always good.  My favorite was the lamb ragu with grits. Pigeonhole's great bread was perfect for souping up every morsel.  If you like Fred Flintstone sized portions, the braised short rib would be wonderful. The taste was savory and delicious. The crispy walleye had a consummate corn breading, but the remoulade was a bit too sweet for my palate.   Our server picked up we were getting full, and with great prescience, asked us if we wanted to cancel our additional orders.  Yes! She was amazing and added to our dining experience.  I will return to Pigeonhole every time I'm in Calgary! Bravissimo!"}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance. Good service. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that the value on many of the items is not particularly high. That said, the menu is inventive and, while I enjoyed some items more than others, all were well-prepared using top-notch ingredients.  Would definitely recommend to friends and go back."}
{"text":"Excellent tapas style plates perfect for sharing - although very tasty a full meal is a little rich for my palette. List of new takes on classic dishes and beautiful ingredients. All wines are organic/bio-dynamic and the cocktails are excellent."}
{"text":"Came here as part of a medium sized bachelorette party. Our server offered to choose our plates for us and was very attentive the whole time. The dishes were nothing less than what I have come to expect from pigeonhole - delicious and varied and the desserts are probably my favourite in Calgary. Favorite dishes were the softshell crab and the charred cabbage - and of course all three of the desserts (you really can't go wrong with any) but the lemon madeleines were the star of the show. Came out fresh from the oven...enough said. The only downside to our night is that in the flurry of activity we all forgot about the included gratuity in our bill and the server made no mention of it at the end, puzzling as good servers always do. As the first few people started paying (and double tipping) he continued to say nothing and it wasn't until we were all done that we realized we had just paid a 35% tip for our $900 bill. Pretty shady, definitely won't make the mistake of returning with a group to avoid this! Pigeonhole please tell your servers to remind large groups of the included gratuity - it's just a classy touch."}
{"text":"Server here was awesome! Cocktails are also mixed well... and the food!! I have to be honest that I wasn't sold on some of the recommendation, but when they got to the table!! Wow!"}
{"text":"This spot is GORGEOUS in a total Gatsby-esque way... which is what I hope they were going for, otherwise I'm totally off. They have a great collection of cocktails that come in vintage glasses. Beware though: these are potent. Delicious, but potent. You won't notice because they go down smooth but the sugar and gin will hit you later, right around the same time as the tab. At $13 a pop, this isn't the venue for a frugal evening out, but perfect for a girls night or a something-special date. Staff was lovely and attentive, and particularly accommodating to our rowdy group of 7, god bless them. This is a great new addition to 17th, and I'll be back to sample more of the menu soon!"}
{"text":"First time I went to Pigeonhole it was instantly my favorite restaurant in Calgary. Now that we've been a second time, it's still my favorite! Food, service, atmosphere all amazing. So many delicious & unique food options, that I'll never get tired of coming there! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the concept and look of Pigeonhole. It was perfect for a Friday night date night. We tried chicken liver mousse, charred cabbage, ricotta dumplings and grilled octopus. All were really great except the octopus. It was extreme chewy and lacking in flavour. The lamb marguez on the dish was tasty but not enough to carry the dish. We would not order it again.   The other three dishes were excellent and we will definitely visit again. We were also impressed with their list of craft cocktails. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Now, I cannot comment on a normal outing here since this is where I decided we have my company Christmas party in 2015. However, I wanted to review Piegeonhole on that service because it was amazing.  From start to finish the staff were helpful, attentive and dedicated to our group. The space was decorated beautifully and the food was delicious. There was always someone around to fill up your cup and put a canape in your hand.   I would recommend this venue to anyone!"}
{"text":"This spot is a gem!  Service is really excellent and attentive. Food is small portions; they are all very good and tasteful. Drink menu is small but really high quality. Atmosphere is really fun.  Def recommend this place."}
{"text":"Lets talk about how much I both love and loath Pigeonhole.  Love: decor is amazing, wine list is extension, food is unreal tasty, service was pretty good, and all in all a great atmosphere.  Loath: what is with the some of the highest price points on food I have seen in Calgary for \"tapas\" style portions that are minuscule? Now don't get me wrong it was fantastically tasty, but every time a plate came out all I could think was \"are you kidding is that all?\" Now I get the price point on deboned confit duck leg, but I don't understand paying $11 for 3 slices of sweet potato with some with huckleberry and sheeps milk feta. Was it shower in shaved gold?  My friend and I are always out for more higher end elaborate style meals, and both of us stopped after 5 dishes because we refused to pay any more money and we were still ravenously hungry. This is the first time I have ever left a restaurant after a meal and actually gone somewhere else to eat more.  I am super disappointed because the food is so good, but dont understand why they are skimping on portions? Just cant justify a return visit."}
{"text":"I had an awesome summer feast meal that was a ridiculously good value at 35$. The food is nuanced and a total flavour trip of different cuisines. I love being surprised with the new seasonal dishes the kitchen puts out. Anything off the charcoal grill is bound to be awesome. The desserts are simple but delicious. My favourite restaurant in Calgary"}
{"text":"I always find the staff here to be so sweet and welcoming. I love the decor and the space, they did a great job in a building that could easily feel weird.   Eat here if you are up for an adventure! Everything is unique and many menu items change throughout the year.   Like many people I am a fan of the charred cabbage, other faves are the wagu beef tartare, oysters and superb selection of cheeses.   The cocktails ARE SO SO GOOD and they have a killer wine list. My favorite cocktail is the Earl Grey Martini."}
{"text":"Hand down, the best food I've had in Canada (other than Tim Hortons of course).  The service was incredible. The wine selection was great and well priced. The food was tremendous. This was a fine dining experience that should cost a lot more than it does. We loved everything single thing we ate."}
{"text":"Good service and ambiance. The food very average. I had great expectations and will never go back. Overpriced,  very average dishes and very small  portions. I don't mind small portions if the food is well prepared with exceptional ingredients but they fail in both. Thus this restaurants days are numbered."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here since I read it was #1 in En Route magazine for Canada's new restaurant. I was pretty impressed. Atmosphere was hipster-ish which i liked. Food wise most everything is served tapas style. We had the charred cabbage which was surprisingly full of flavor, rabbit which I find difficult to overcook but they kept it juicy and flavorful, halibut which tasted quite refreshing, the duck, and madelines for dessert - fresh from the oven. Portions are small for the price but it is tapas style. However, each dish had their own ubique flavors and were quite tasty. If it wasn't for the cost I'd probably return frequently."}
{"text":"We came here a month ago on the last leg of our honeymoon as our \"splurge\" celebration meal and we were severely disappointed... We used to live in Calgary, work in the industry, and we have been to many restaurants including Model Milk (which we really enjoyed) so we thought Pigeonhole would be a safe bet.  We came in on a busy Friday night - a bit later in the night (around 9:30pm). Our server/bartender was great - the cocktails we ordered were not very palatable though (although they were strong!).  We ordered a few plates to try:  Salted cod crepes - these were delicious! Perfectly cooked and great flavour combinations. Charred cabbage - also tasty, but a bit greasy Cauliflower - it really was as amazing as the reviews say!  BC Pine Mushrooms - definitely not a win - our sourdough baguette was burnt (not toasted, not \"charred\") and so burnt in fact that it was all you could taste - we had to take the mushrooms off the bread to fully enjoy the subtle taste Milk fed veal breast - do NOT get this - we literally had the taste of sesame stuck in our mouths for the rest of the night. It was SO salty and SO doused with sesame sauce we couldn't even finish it, much less taste the actual veal (I'm sure it was delicious).  Not sure if it was late and the kitchen dropped the ball, but for such a high rated restaurant you'd think their quality & service would be on par no matter what time it is.   Yes we did like 3/5 dishes, maybe we just made bad choices on the other 2? But the thing that left us with the most sour taste in our mouths (after the saltiness of the sesame) was the management style. My husband (a former chef who has worked in some of the best restaurants in this country) talked to the manager (or supervisor) about our \"abysmal\" dishes - he removed the veal off our bill that we barely ate, but was in no way sympathetic, or willing to go the extra mile to change our opinion of the food and restaurant. We were still STARVING but after being treated like we were somewhere that we didn't belong and didn't deserve to be taken care of, we just paid the bill and went somewhere else. Absolutely terrible hospitality on his part and the restaurant's for that matter."}
{"text":"When I booked for a table for two on Valentines, the online reservation system told me the only slot available was at 9:30pm. This was THREE WEEKS before Valentines. Still there's nothing more romantic than taking the #1 woman of your heart to Canada's (new) #1 restaurant. I don't think I've seen Pigeonhole's dining ambiance in Calgary before. I've never been to Europe much, but I read that someone thought this was reminiscent of Paris' night bistros. I definitely felt like a film extra on Paris J'Taime. We loved the decor and felt it was a place you went to celebrate with your significant other.  First I was thoroughly impressed with our service. The hostesses were welcoming and warm, the staff moved about like ninjas as they brought our dishes and moved our plates, and our server who was well versed with the menu and provided the most intelligent and thorough breakdown of the experience each dish and cocktail on the menu.Even though their presence wasn't made, kudos should also be given to management.  The food at Pigeonhole is memorable and deserving of the praise it's received. I don't know where to begin because to say each dish was my favorite makes me feel like a lazy parent refusing to pick a favourite child. Thank god I don't have children.  The ricotta dumplings inspire obsession within every gastronome, I can still recall the wow factor every bite this dish had, the pillow-y rich dumpling with the slight savory earthiness of spinach, tied together with a ragu I'd sacrifice my left arm for.  The nori crumpets were tasty, but what was interesting about the dish was the shrimp butter. The rabbit and bacon pate on bread and octopus and marguez sausage stew were stellar. The pate was meaty and subtle in flavour, enhanced by the toasted bread and fresh garden greens. The octopus stew was tender and every chew yielded so much umami goodness, which included the wonderful spice that leaked out from the north african merguez sausage.  Finally the burnt cabbage, which I suspect could be an item most diners gloss over because they think \"how the fuck is cabbage fancy\" But any diner who has seen their fare share of artsy food shows know know all about burnt cabbage and the smoky sweet experience it brings. Seems easy but it's a hard dish to cook in I.M.H.O and Pigeonhole executes a sweet and complex smoky cabbage that's wonderfully spiked with aged cheddar.  The cocktail menu is small, after all Pigeonhole is a wine joint. We aren't big wine people, we dug into 3 of their great cocktails. Which were great and potent. Again credit to our waitress for suggesting the right libation at the right time. It all went so well with the food we ate."}
{"text":"I really like Pigeonhole. It's a fun, charming place that serves up unique (to me at least) dishes that won't break the bank. You can eat a lot or a little, as the dishes are served in snack size portions.   The last time I visited, we tried some amazing vegetarian dishes. My favourite was a tomato tart and a deconstructed salad. This ain't your neighbourhood pub or favourite steakhouse. Go with girlfriends or with a group of people that enjoy imaginative food that is beautifully presented.   One day I'll check out their caviar and champagne special on Monday."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. We usually sit at the bar (best view of the cheeses, drool) the manager is awesome, probably the best service experience I've had in the city. We've only tried a few of the dishes they were both amazing. Love the rotating menu, always something new. This place is a must visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic tapas with share-able portions. The beef tartare is incredible. Great whiskey selection. Reasonable prices for the quality and portions. Service is good and servers are friendly. The flatware is adorable."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this new place out, with all the hype that has been in the media and that it is related to Model Milk, which is a great restaurant.  The decor is nice enough, the wallpaper is atrocious, are they going for gramma's kitchen? Some of the tables must be left over from the old Victoria's restaurant , I'm all for up-cycling , but ugly is ugly. Now to the food ... Tapas style and sharing .... They should go to Barcelona to check out what tapas culture really is. Tapas are generally cheaper, more casual and quick . The service was good, but slow and it was a Tuesday evening. Having said that, it's nice to see restaurants busy during the week. The noise level was unbearably loud, not a place for a date or a romantic evening. Unless you want to breakup in public! No one will hear you or your partner begging to give it, just one more chance. Our food took quite a while to come out. The devilled eggs were too salty. The Tuna with the puffed rice was good , minus the puffed rice, and it was overly doused in a soupy soya sauce flavour that completely drowned the Tuna, that was supposed to be the star of the dish. Then we had the ricotta dumplings, they were perfect, the haloumi with the beets were delicious , the duck was tender, three very good picks .  For dessert we had the lemon. Mandelines , they were also nice light and a reasonable portion.  So, we had two glasses of wine , 5 dishes, one dessert for $110.00, pre tip. You may leave Pigeonhole hungry, but you're eating like a bird after all.  Even though I didn't give a very good rating , I would still return, I do appreciate the creativity that goes into the food, and would try other options. This would not be my go to restaurant , however, when you're sitting around trying to figure out what to do and where to eat on a weekend , I would see Pigeonhole as a weekday option."}
{"text":"Fairly new place with the same owner as Model Milk.   First of all, the dishes are tapas style and they will adjust portions of each dish to accommodate to how many people are in your party. We had 5 and they charged extra to add extra pieces to plates (ex. Dumplings come in 4, charge extra for 1 extra). Although they didn't tell us before doing so, we appreciated it. If you don't want them to do that, you should let your server know.   We tried many dishes and I would recommend; - Charred cabbage (Taste reminds me of okonomiyaki!) - Ricotta dumplings - Cheese platter (There's about 14 diff kinds - you can trust your server to bring out whichever based on your preferences or you can choose) - Pine haven grass fed beef  We also tried the salmon, tuna crudo, tomatoes and peaches, lamb tartare, boar sausage, mushroom, and the cidar glazed chicken. All these dishes were good, but I think a bit more unique and would depend on personal preferences.   For dessert we had pot de creme and the maple butter madeleines. The maple butter is the filling inside the madeleine (for some reason I thought it would be a dip on the side) but it came out nice and warm and were really good! Served in 3s. The pot de creme is very thick and has a strong coffee taste to it. It's not my fav but I also don't like the thick textured desserts (personal preference).   I like the atmosphere of the restaurant. The service was excellent - our server was extremely friendly and took the time to make recommendations and very accommodating.   If you are curious about the dishes, I would request for a table near the kitchen where all the food comes out. You can check out the plates as servers walk past you :D   I recommend trying this place with a large group of people so you can get a taste of everything.   A little bit on the pricier side so maybe save it for a fancy girls night out or some kind of occasion ;)"}
{"text":"I defiantly agree it's an overpriced overhyped foodie destination. Between 2 people we ordered: grilled meatballs, shabu shabby beef, cabbage and chicken dumplings, and the \"family size\" fish tacos. pro: lovley service, hipster decor and cabbage dumpling which had onion just sauce and stuffed with gouda.  cons: PRICE for each tapas dish it's  $18 for what I felt like I got... gravey with meatball(grilled mratballs), panchetta with salty miso soup(shabu shabu), $48 fish tacos which you have to de-bone dilligently.   Disclaimer: I am a foodie and have been to michelin star restaurants where I would GLADY pay again to have again. I've also been to Vietnam to have the \"fish style\" taco and Japan for shabu shabu and it is a POOR comparison. For a $150 meat I expected much better."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, and I had high expectations as I am a fan of Model Milk, but I left pretty disappointed and underwhelmed. The food is average, at best. The atmosphere is decent and the staff were great, but that's about all Pigeonhole has going for it at the moment."}
{"text":"This place serves absolutely delectable food. This tapas place uses fresh ingredients in innovative ways, pairing tastes that I didn't think would go together, and yet, do. One prime example is the yellow beets with pecans, horse radish creme, and BC cherries. Sounds weird, and yet tastes marvelous. The roasted cabbage with jalape√±o and the lobster mushroom vied for first place. The cabbage was impressive and allegedly their best selling dish; a lowly vegetable elevated, with a soft moist interior laced with crispy edges ever so slightly burnt, laid over a magnificent jalape√±o aioli and topped with mounds of cheese. Mouthwatering.   The place isn't cheap (we paid ~$65 a person for food + drinks) - but it's oh so worth it. It's a perfect place for 2 people to dine - you get just enough of the dish to feel satiated. I've come with 4 and it's fine, but you end up just craving more because it's so delicious. We ordered 6 dishes between the two of us and we were stuffed...and we're two guys with good appetites. Our server with prompt, friendly, and offered us more aioli when it didn't seem like we had enough. When we mentioned we were in a slight rush, she immediately got us our bill.   Best food I've had in Calgary so far."}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary and my friend brought me here. I love the decor. It's modern and cozy and comforting. Arrived on a Tuesday night, we had no trouble getting a table.  Service was awesome. No complaints here. For food, we had: - charred cabbage - 5/5 - who would have thought!?? Is that Japanese mayo they brush on in? So good!! - half duck - 4/5 my expectations of duck are quite high. Presentation reminds me of Peking duck. But the pancakes they serve it with is weird. It's like eating foamy pancakes and they only give you 6? Which is not enough to finish the bird. They're too thick to really hold much meat either. This is a shared plate.. so I would have expected them to cut the duck for us in slices so it was awkward for our party to distribute. Instead we made quite a mess. The gravy was delicious. I thought the meat was a bit over cooked perhaps. as the meat was a little soft and mealy? - oxtail and grits - 3.5/5 - meh it's was okay. Wasn't a fan of the grits. Had shrimp and grits last month in San Fran and was blown away. This version left me \"meh\" - spinach ricotta with truffle gnocchi. 4/5 these are more like gnuudis. The sauce is amazing !!!! - lemon Madeline's - 5/5- yum! Great way to end the me. Warm and made to order. Edges are perfectly crispy and crunchy with soft warm centers. I would like 12 please hehe  I'd come her again for sure but would probably try their octopus and get the cabbage again"}
{"text":"I have been here thrice in less than a year; each time I had the same server Ashley. Firstly, she's amazing...bar none. Attentive, caring, funny; had wine pairings down to a tee. Secondly, I have significant allergies and each time I arrived, both the wait staff and the kitchen were prepared to accommodate. The ambience is reminiscent of my favourite haunt in NYC, and while it is a titch loud, I always enjoy the background music and leave with a full belly. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Amazing! Just like their sister restaurant, great atmosphere and the staff is knowledgeable and courteous. The food... Just gotta try it. Had the chilled prawns, soft shell crab and bone marrow. I would order it all again, and again!"}
{"text":"I love meals where we can go \"sharesies\" on things and Pigeonhole is perfect for this. The serving sizes are on the smaller side as people have noticed but the quality is definitely up there, I really enjoyed everything we tried from the charred cabbage to the lamb tartare, so tasty! We were basically licking the absolutely adorable dishes. They use the cutest china and I love the assorted different dishes everything is served on. Their cocktail menu looks tasty but I stuck to wine when we went."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a spur-of-the-moment dinner with friends. Pigeonhole was able to accommodate our preferred booking time and our allergy requests. The ambience is casual. Loved the decor and set up of the restaurant with three dining areas. When the restaurant is full, it can be noisy. Our server was pleasant and helpful. She gave us a list of all GF menu options (about 2/3 of the menu) and checked on a few more items that were modified for us.  The restaurant was packed but our table service was well-timed. It was laid back but attentive. Our water and wine glasses were re-filled promptly. We shared 5 plates and were pleased with all the flavours. The presentation was lovely and the food was at the right temperature. This is tapas with a twist (not just spanish dishes). Our favourite was the grilled cabbage! We will return. This was an A+ dining experience and our food bill was reasonable for the level of service and food quality."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a treat on their patio- great location fabulous service. Wine list was disappointing, and pricey. the tapas were pretty good, but the vinaigrette over powered the ceviche flavours. Can't go wrong with Oysters! Enjoyed the ambience"}
{"text":"Pretentious and overpriced. Food was OK at best but portions are terrible. We ordered this scallop dish and we literally got raw scallops (so they didn't even have the laborious tasks of having to cook it) which they quartered (it was microscopic at this point) and split them into 8 or 10 very small scallop shell, they put slivers (micro) of  some sort of pickled vegetable on each one, the thing was like $18. It tasted like plain raw scallops and nothing else, nothing out of the ordinary at all. Rip off 100%.  The rest of the \"non vegetable\" dishes we ordered were much of the same, very small portions, tasted like something anybody could've cooked at home and priced triple of what it's worth. I understand it's a fancy and higher end, but I'd eaten at plenty of those type of places and left satisfied even after paying high prices. This place was so underwhelming."}
{"text":"Pigeonhole is Model Milk's twin sister with an eclectic twist towards small shareable plates. They've made quite a name for themselves already despite only being open for a year.  The entrance isn't where you'd expect it to be but that's part of the charm. Love the charcoal coloured exposed brick and vintage sign. The patio out front looked like a great place to sit for couples or if you wanted to people watch the night away.  The menu is a one pager and split into vegetables, meat, seafood, seasonal, caviar, cheese and sweets. The space is absolutely gorgeous; elegant, cozy, modern and intimate. Love the wide open kitchen concept. We were seated right in front of all the action.  Service is excellent and our waitress was able to walk through the full menu with my sis to make sure everything was good for her to eat.  - French 75 ($14.50) - BC cherries ($12.00) - Clams casino ($4.00) - Ricotta dumplings ($16.00) - Fresh oysters ($20.00 for 1/2 dozen) - Smashed cucumbers ($11.00) - Zucchini ($13.00) - Heritage angus steak ($26.00) - Grilled duck leg ($18.00) - Lamb breast ($15.00) - Stuffed mountain view chicken ($29.00) - Cheese platter ($35.00 for five cheeses) - Strawberries and cream ($8.00)  Flavours, presentation, and service - Pigeonhole has it all covered. We had a great meal here but my only complaint here would be the portion sizes. Besides that, it's a great addition to 17th Ave's burgeoning restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Finally got to check out this place and I have to say that I loved my experience here! I came here last Friday around 5pm, right before it started to get busy. The ambiance is very quaint and lovely inside.  While looking at the menu, there were so many dishes that I wanted to try! Unfortunately, we didn't get to try absolutely everything because we weren't that hungry. My recommendations would be the: Eggplant Baba Ghanoush (something light and to get the taste buds stirring), Halloumi Cheese (it's goat cheese.. and although sheep/goat is something I tend to stray away from due to its gamey-ness, I couldn't taste the strong scent and returned to this dish for seconds.. and even thirds...), and the ricotta dumplings (something different and unique)! Though our server did mention that they change up the menu quite often, so I'll have to make sure I return soon enough to ensure my fav. dishes are still there and also so I can try the things I missed this time around.  Our server Andrew was very attentive and informative. He was very approachable and even went on to explain how all the China's that Pigeonhole used were bought individually, as there was no duplication of the same plates (cute!). While being friendly, he was not overbearing and made sure that we were still able to enjoy our conversation uninterrupted.  I will definitely return! The only downside to this tapas restaurant is that you have to ensure you don't come super hungry. You'll have to drop a number of bills before you can get full."}
{"text":"Tapas style. Maybe need 2-3 items per person depending on how hungry you are. Both drinks and food is delicious here. Menu changes often. Tuna and hand rolled pasta is must order. Quality of food and service is really great."}
{"text":"All the plates and cocktails are so yummy!! Such a posh and elegant venue. This place is definitely one of the best cocktails bars I have been to in Calgary and their plates are delicious.  I recommend coming here with 2-3 friends so you can try several dishes and a couple cocktails without spending too much money. I went with a couple friends and we shared 4 dishes and had two cocktails each and with tip our total was about $70.00 - not bad for gourmet cuisine and very good cocktails.  My favourite dish was the charred cabbage. This is one of those creative dishes where chefs prove they can make anything taste delicious with the right ingredients and cooking. Well done chefs. Well done.  The ricotta dumplings were a close second favourite. If you are a \"cheese person\" you'll love them. The rabbit roulade and grilled duck leg were also very good. You really can't go wrong. Order whatever you're in the mood for and you'll probably be pretty pleased.  The earl grey martini was also yum. All around a beautiful new Calgary venue with epic tapas =)"}
{"text":"We really enjoy coming here and often come here for date nights. The food is amazing, the service is wonderful and the plates are also really pretty. For 2 people we usually order 6 dishes to share and our favourites include the charred cabbage, chicken liver mousse and the tuna."}
{"text":"I thought this place was darling and it's so close to where we live! The atmosphere is incredibly unique and charming and spending an evening sipping delicious cocktails with my husband and enjoying a series of eclectic dishes was exactly what we both needed! The plates they serve all their food on are just darling! The restaurant is small so I'd advise making a reservation before hand, or you might now get in! The food plates are small so you might have to order a few to make up a full dinner which can get expensive that was my only complaint. However, the quality of food and uniqueness of the cocktails definitely made up for it! Now that it's summer I can't wait to check out their patio!"}
{"text":"We'd heard lots about this restaurant, especially given it's high ranking within Canada's top 100 (10th spot), and were anxious to try it out. Making a reservation was easy using the OpenTable service on their website and a follow-up phone call from the hostess the day before. We were brought here by our waiter at Model Milk where we'd enjoyed drink prior. We were quickly seated at a rather small table near the big and bright windows. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and always handy and suggested some dishes for us to try. The dining style here is more like sampler plates and we ended up ordering 6 such plates with drinks to accompany them. Everything we ate was delicious - and inventive - and we thoroughly enjoyed the culinary experience. The kitchen is open and feels like it is right there in the dining room, and in fact you practically walk through it to use the restrooms! Our only criticisms are that the tables are a bit small, and the atmosphere was a little subdued - we didn't get a huge vibe - it was more like eating in a library. But then, if you;re here for a quiet dinner date, it is fine! We can't wait to come back and try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had this year. Partner and I had seven plates: watermelon with smoked tofu, cauliflower, ricotta dumplings, crepes stuffed with cod, veal, octopus, and cabbage. Each was masterfully complex and not one wasn't delicious, but if I had to pick ones I'd order again they'd be the cauliflower (one of the best treatments of one of my favourite vegetables), the cod crepes and the cabbage... but ask me again if the menu shakes things up. Service was absolutely perfect, smart, friendly, and the pacing of the dishes was very impressive given how complex managing this format is. So SEVEN shared plates, two glasses of wine and one excellent Village K√∂lsch were $120. Stunning deal, beautiful experience all around."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype! Pigeonhole is full of poorly executed pigeon portions that will make your pockets sweat. When I know it's a restaurant based on share plates/tapas I know portions will be small, but when they aren't even done well? What's the point? The decor is its saving grace along with forgiving staff, but that only made the experience tolerable. Now to the food. To start we shared the beef tartare with beer cheese along with the oyster mushrooms. For $12 you get one sliced mushroom that's been grilled to a palatable texture but is really just that, a paltry portion that's nothing to write home about. The tartare on the other is delicious, but looks like a pile of ground beef. Pigeonhole wants to present differently but this does nothing for the dish except make it look like gross intestines. Next up are the scallops. There is no sear! What is this!? They fortunately bring out four small scallops so it's easier to share, but execution leaves so much to be desired. Last are the lamb ribs. Fatty, salty and almost inedible. When the server came to check we did mention our disappointment with certain dishes but exclaimed greatness over the tartare. Much to our surprise, both the scallops and ribs were taken off our bill. We tried to experience one more dish but it was just weird. The strawberry cheesecake was served deconstructed aka, no crust and just oddly packed into a bowl with a lime gremolata. The gremolata was of course icy and crunch which made for a grainy experience with the cheesecake, the opposite of what you look for in a cheesecake!!! We made sure to line our servers pockets for her efforts knowing we will never be back again. Just be forewarned it's not as great as you think!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I would have never expected it to be what it was being at the end of 17th.  The service was incredible. The menu was diverse and the server was excellent at explaining the different tastes that created a dish. She was able to help us pick a delicious wine based on our descriptions of likes and dislikes and paired them nicely with their cheese plate.   The desert was scrumptious."}
{"text":"awesome food, good atmosphere! charred cabbage was my favourite"}
{"text":"Pigeonhole was named one of the top 10 restaurants in Canada this year and that's saying alot because Eastern Canada tends to hog all the top spots in the business. It was a no brainer for us to check it out and see if the place truly stands among the best in Canada.  Environment - Place was trendy and staff was excellent. We didn't get to sit next to the open kitchen but we were just happy that we got a reso on a Saturday night a few days before. You could tell all the staff take pride in their role in the restaurant. Our server was very knowledgable and worked hard to provide the best dining experience for us.  Food - Pigeonhole's choice to serve tapas allows you to tantalize the full spectrum of your tastebuds. As recommended by pretty much everyone we talked to, we tried the charred cabbage ignoring the instincts of my palate, and I'm glad I did. It's a dish that should not work, but somehow Pigeonhole was able to work its magic and created something that's both bitter and sweet. Another worthy dish was the Applewood smoked chicken. As told by our server, the chicken had been in the smoker for a good number of hours and you could definitely tell. The meat was moist and full of flavor. It had a texture that was not quite chicken, but somewhat resembled pork. The other dishes were good as well, but I plan not to write an essay here.  Value - While Pigeonhole was more expensive than the typical tapas restaurant, it was truly an unique experience worth the admission. Portions were not great, but that was to be expected from a tapas style restaurant. As my buddy always said, just head over to McDonald's for a top up afterwards.  Overall - I would definitely recommend Pigeonhole to anyone who seeks an unique and satisfying culinary experience."}
{"text":"Group of 4 of us had dinner here prior to the Peter Gabriel/Sting concert. The food was amazing! You have to like the whole small plate sharing thing, but it is worth it. Our server was great as well (sorry can't recall her first name). Will be back!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar.  Great staff and decor, with a great but not huge wine list.  You won't find much but name on the list, but thats what i prefer.  No point paying for the name, I'll rather pay for the whats inside the bottle.  Food is delicate, smaller dishes for sharing.  Overall excellent."}
{"text":"This was our first meal in Calgary. Pigeonhole is next to Model Milk and by the same owner. It's located on 17th Street where we got free parking a block away as the street was under construction in front of the restaurant. It had a nice hipster ambiance with music playing from a record player in the back. We ordered the following dishes for dinner that our server recommended - the cabbage, dumpling, smoked pork ribs. I was trying to decide between tagliatelle or spaetzle and went with tagliatelle which comes with bolognese meat sauce. I wanted to try the seafood too but thought we ordered too much already. The tagliatelle and pork ribs were served first and we were full by the time we finished these two dishes. They were good.  We waited a while before we were served the charred cabbage and ricotta dumpling. The server said the cabbage is the most popular dish of the restaurant which i thought was odd as its cabbage! It was ok; I didn't like the aioli sauce that the cabbage was served on top of. Also the plate was huge and the sauce made the dish heavy. I also didn't like the soft texture of the ricotta dumplings.   For dessert we tried the cheesecake topped with granita and strawberries. It was good especially the granita that I wished the dish had more of."}
{"text":"Wow!  Well done all around.  Great d√©cor, kind and attentive service, delicious drinks and menu items.  So tantalizing that my husband, who absolutely detests cabbage, LOVED the charred cabbage. The mussels were exceptional, as were the ricotta dumplings.  The cheesecake was not only tasty, but also playfully presented.  I must say, though, the fresh-baked madeleines were my favourite.  I wish there was a Pigeonhole in Vancouver!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous. I have start by saying I love any restaurant that thane the cheese out of the fridge before opening. Small plates restaurant with impeccable service. I enjoyed the pork ribs,grilled cabbage with some delicious cheese on top, homemade burrata with peas and mint, tomato salad."}
{"text":"This restaurant cannot be pigeonholed into any specific   genre of food.  The menu is unique and original with incredible flavours and textures.  I absolutely loved the food. Our waiter told us that we would need 10-12 plates to satisfy our group of four.  We thought at first that this was a bold up sell but it was the truth in the end.  As you can imagine this resulted in a hefty bill but in my opinion worth the spend. The wait staff worked as a seamless team.  At one point I joked with my friends that my plate (each plate is unique and mismatched) was not as nice as the others.  Before I knew it he was there with a replacement and mischievous look in his eye.  They did a tremendous job of anticipating all of our needs.    We tried a vast assortment of their small plates. My favorites were the broccoli, tartare, rabbit and bacon pate, fresh oysters and celery root.  For a larger plate we shared the braised short rib and finished with a cheese platter.  Basically you cannot go wrong.  Everything is amazing.    If they could reduce the price or make the portions just a little bit larger this would be perfection."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Red Kuri Squash - Burrata, Honey Oyster Mushroom - Scallion, Crispy Rice Gremolata Ember Roasted Sweet Potato - Huckleberry, Sheep's Milk Feta Grilled Meatballs - Sake & Pork Gravy, Chili, Parmesan Potato 'Risotto' - Candy Cap, Pine Nut, Burgundy Truffle Pork Neck - BBQ, Apples, Cabbage, Spicy Nuts Confit Duck Leg - Parsnip, Sea Buckthorn Aerated Cheesecake - Caramelized Apple, Hazelnut Meyer Lemon Cream - Olive Oil Crumble, Cucumber  Leaving Model Milk on Saturday night it was difficult to shake the feeling that I'd be missing out by not also visiting Pigeonhole next door, Justin Leboe's Wine and Snack Bar which was said to be just as good as his acclaimed first Restaurant subsequently welcoming me back for an early dinner on Tuesday thanks to a Social Media conversation plus a mutual friend.    Arriving just after four o'clock, the space empty then but near-full by 5:30, it was with greetings from the hostess that I was led to a windowside table where Leboe would later greet me, the Chef speaking passionately about dining in Western Canada with a keen eye for goings-on elsewhere as he described his restaurant concepts and the staff with proud, fatherly words.  Spread laterally across two levels, a significant departure from Model Milk which runs long from door to back, diners at Pigeonhole are presented with a varied but well-culled menu created by Leboe and chef de cuisine Garrett Martin, the general idea based on natural flavors honed during a stage in Copenhagen with a focus on Canadian ingredients.  Every bit as trendy as Model Milk, though servers here seem better trained in the art of casual courtesy, it was with seven plates selected plus two offered from the kitchen that the meal progressed fluidly, opening bites of skewered Mushrooms balancing brine with bright acidity and pungent Scallions while the brilliant orange Squash seemed almost too bright to be real amidst creamy housemade Burrata and just a touch of Honey.  Happy to see Sweet Potato on this menu, the version next door a stunner, Chef Martin's version sees the Tuber softened over embers from a wood grill with amidst Huckleberries and Sheep Feta, that same wood Grill responsible for the smoke-imbued slab of Pork Neck that harkened a backyard Barbecue while three pool-ball sized orbs of Meat bathed in a thin yet complex sauce that featured both booze and a bit of heat.  Anticipating the makeshift Risotto from the moment I first looked at the online menu, Candy Cap Mushrooms used to lightly sweeten thinly diced Potatoes perfumed in Truffles, Pigeonhole's Confit Duck fell just short of the dry-aged version seen just three nights prior, though that speaks more to the quality of that version than of any issues with this one as the tender chunks of Turnip were a fancy counterpoint to the sour Berries of Sea Buckthorn.  Happy to see a few desserts offered, the online menu devoid of that information, both the Aerated Cheesecake and Meyer Lemon Cream are presented as exploitations of expectations with a focus on texture, the former putting a base of caramelized Apples beneath a cloud dusted in Hazelnuts while the latter is a dense Pudding a la Pot de Cr√®me with sweet Meyer Lemons finding balance in grassy Olive Oil Crumble and Cucumber Cream."}
{"text":"I visited Pigeonhole for the second time and was just as impressed as the first trip there. My date and I had the ricotta dumplings, beef tartar, charred cabbage, and lamb ribs. It was all very good and since we sat at the bar it was somewhat dinner and a show watching the bartender create different cocktails. Great time and great food. I'll definitely be back again. *Visited June/17"}
{"text":"Delicious assortment of tapas with interesting flavors and lots of variety! My friend and I got 6 tapas to share between the two of us + a dessert, and were extremely satisfied.  We made a reservation at 730pm for Wednesday night for two, but when we arrived the guests before us were still finishing up dessert at the table. The hostess was incredibly nice and apologized a lot, offering us drinks at the bar to start and potential window bar seating if we wanted to be seated immediately. We opted to wait for a little while (weren't in a huge rush) and got some drinks. I had the Planters Punch, which was fruity and light! We were seated at our table pretty quickly, and our waitress was extremely nice in asking us we'd ever been here before, explaining to us the breakdown of the menu, and highlighting her favorite items.  We ended up basically following her recommendations exactly, ordering the bread, charred cabbage, halibut aguachile, foie gras with spring peas, steak tartare, ricotta dumplings, hen of the woods mushroom, and poached rhubarb. It was all amazing and extremely interesting flavors. The charred cabbage is a staple of Pigeonhole's menu -- it was smothered in butter and cheese and some interesting aoli that made it quite delicious. My personal favorites were the steak tartare and halibut aguachile, as both were quite light and fresh.   Although we were stuffed, we got the poached rhubarb which was delicious. It was very tart, and had yummy chocolate chunks sprinkled on top.  I would definitely recommend anyone looking for good food in Calgary to come and eat here!"}
{"text":"A solid player in the variety of sharing style restaurants available in Calgary. I went for a larger group dinner and enjoyed the attentiveness of the service, ambiance, and food choices. Unique dishes (charred cabbage, green beans with strawberry and feta), and delicious desserts (poached rhubarb and white chocolate make a great pair, who knew?) It is on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it and I would definitely return! They also circled the auto gratuity on the bill, which is a nice reminder and helps avoid confusion when dining with a larger group. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience here a couple months ago. The restaurant was nice and open, you can see the chefs making your dishes depending on where you sit. The service was prompt. We found that the food was pretty good. We had some yummy duck, and mushrooms. The charred cabbage was a bit too salty for our taste. The portions are on the smaller side, but  perfect if you have a group of 4 or more to share. Overall, one of the better restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"I really do love their food... except for the fact that they often change their menus to reflect their local ingredients, seasonal options, etc. The only reason I say this is because some favourites have been rotated off their menus, sadly.   The restaurant is fairly small, but there is a decent amount of seating and even a patio. There is also a bar in the back of the restaurant that makes some delicious cocktails.   Food is almost always delicious. I've never really had a 'miss' before. Even foods that I historically don't like (e.g. lamb) have come out FANTASTIC. In particular, my favourite continues to be the charred cabbage.... so delicious! Also, the lamb tartare, if it's still on their menu.   The only downfall is that the plates are all very small (not sharing sized, more like tapas) and are very expensive. It is definitely not a regular restaurant for us, but more for special occasions.   Service has always been excellent. Staff are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about both the drinks and food they offer. They're also great with helping you choose a menu, which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"First of all you need to know... Earl Grey Martini!  It's not on the menu so it is a secret gem.  Second if you are looking for a quick meal this is not your joint.  We had a 6:30 reservation and didn't get seated until 6:45 and it took 1.5 hrs to complete our event.  It was still worth it and understandable for the number one new restaurant in all of Canada.  The food combinations are unlike any other you've had before.  That said the food is excellent.  The servings are small and you can expect to order 3 plates per person.  This allows you to share and try more dishes. The roasted scallion aoli served with the beef was perhaps my favorite steak topping I have ever had.  The blue plate chicken special was my next favorite.  The chicken is on the bone and a bit difficult to manage on a small plate, but set the pretentiousness to the side and dig in.  This dish was phenomenal.  The jus served with this bowl  had me dipping the ladle for more.  We loved this place and the ambiance it offered.  Love love love love....."}
