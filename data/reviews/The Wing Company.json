{"text":"We waited about 1  1/2 hours for the delivery.       NEVER order the boneless wings - they should call them \"mushy drum stick shaped chicken scraps\".    The flavor was good, but the texture and consistency is quite off-putting.        For the price, I would have been better off just getting some chicken nuggets from Micky-Ds and adding some Franks Red Hot Buffalo sauce myself.  The fries were limp and boring."}
{"text":"this place really is amazing (walking in the door won't tell you that though). the only reason I'm holding back on the 5 star is because I can't give any wing place but all stars (in Richmond hill) that distinction.

they're just down the street from me and we've (me and the roomies) ordered about 3 or 4 times and gone to pickup. not the best place to eat as the seatings more like a waiting room than dining area. really friendly staff (is that delicious wing smell that fills the place making them kooky?) and really tasty wings/poutine/onion rings. 

I suggest the lime and tequila one and the Guinness one, even the experimental types all taste like a wing should so don't be scared to try them. the sides are also spot on, greasy and filling.

it just opened a few months ago but I feel like this will become a go-to for a lot of people. better than duffs and einsteins, on the same level as crown and dragon and only a little shittier than all stars (fucking move to the city already!)"}
{"text":"40 flavors and some other decent options, with large wings. There's something special about the coating they put on their wings that gives them a satisfying crunch and keeps them very moist. 

The only downside to having that many flavors is that sometimes they mess up and you don't get the flavors you actually order. 

The staff are great, but the prices and flavor errors knocked off a star for me. Even so, I'll still keep going back."}
{"text":"Went in and got a small poutine to go. The poutine was mediocure, fries aren't very good. When I was walking home I thought the box seemed very light and when I got home the box was only half full-barely. Barely any food for what i paid. Won't be back."}
{"text":"If you want a good sized wing at a reasonable price and a choice of 40 sauces, then this is the de facto place to go for wings. The delivery, do take out or you can choose to stay and watch the game on their big screen tv. The staff are all nice and helpful and make you feel like a long time customer. 

Simply the beset wings in town. Their fries and onion rings aren't bad either. 

Noteable sauces include: frank's re hot bbq, Lemon Tequilla Chipotle, and Hot mustard."}
{"text":"I take it back! We had friends over and ordered on 1/2 price Tuesday and it took more than 2 HOURS to get our delivery!! Not impressed with such bad service on their busiest of nights. There is never a good excuse for 2hour wait times...! The wings were warm and fries were getting hard by the time they arrived. Boo! Only order from here early in the evening and not on Monday or Tues!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped into the wing Company to grab a small poutine.  They packed it all up and when I got home it had maybe 15 fries and 3 cheese curds all over cooked.  When I took it back in to ask how they justified this and very politely asked if they would top it up.  The manager told me if I didn't like it I should just take my fries and just not come back .... are you kidding me?  When I tried to further discuss the matter I was told not to argue with him.  I then suggested that perhaps he should just give me my money back as this was not what I had expected.  He refused, told me the cooked fries were useless to him and that I should leave.  I quietly persisted and eventually got my money back - I will not be back - sadly, I will never get a chance to sample the wings."}
{"text":"Inedible.  Had the salt and pepper wings.  Hardly any salt, no pepper.  Batter was thick and hard.  I think the seasoning just bounced off of it, hence the lack of salt and pepper.  Wings, if you managed to chip through the batter, were dry, dry, dry.  We ate the fries (good) and the onion rings (good), but threw most of the wings away.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Okay so for me, this is the best wing joint in the city of Toronto.  They disappointed me for a bit when they switched their wing supplier and they became super small, but hey, I let them know (I'm sure I wasn't the only one) and the big wings are back.  That for me, adds to the greatness, what good is a business that doesn't listen to their customers?  I have tons of great stories about this place and them going above and beyond for me.  they definitely know my name and my face. lol"}
{"text":"Warning!!! Do not order the chicken burger from here! We have received an unacceptable \"Buffalo chicken crunch\" burger. Picture above. It was two small, dry and flattened pieces of chicken that were separate on the bun which left a big gap in between. Our wings were bigger then these pieces of chicken. Called to complain to see if maybe staff messed up on the burger. The employee over the phone said this IS the standard burger. She then went to speak to the owner, who chose NOT to speak to us over the phone. Girl on the phone should not have been the one to deal with our situation. Nevertheless, we will never order from here again. Try somewhere else."}
{"text":"rdered from here on the weekend.  I had been wanting to try this place out for awhile, so my girlfriend and I decided to place an order to try out what they had. The order was:

-10 wings with fries, with medium sauce.
-10 boneless wings with onion rings (they didn't have wedges).  We found out there was an up-charge for onion rings.
-1 regular poutine.

I was confused by the total, which was around $39. Seemed like a lot more than the prices advertized on their website, they stood firm that it was correct, we didn't argue and ordered.  Delivery time quoted was an hour.

The food arrived about 45 minutes after the order was placed, so I was happy with the delivery.  Driver was polite and tipped. We got ourselves settled with our own drinks, turned on a movie and dug in.

The bone-in wings were flavourful, but a little on the soggy side for my liking.  Sauce was good, a great medium sauce to gauge where to go next time.  I think I might go for hot next time.  Great flavour to the sauce, but the wings were not my favorites. 

The boneless wings were unfortunately small, but damn were they tasty! I They didn't have much sauce on then, luckily with the bone-in wings having so much, I was able to dip and enjoy.

As for the sides, the fries were delicious, and according to my girlfriend, so was the poutine.  The onion rings left me sad, unfortunately. I understand having an upcharge for sides different from simple fries, but if I'm paying an extra couple of dollars, I expect more than seven onion rings.  The portion of fries were generous enough for the price, but with a $2 upcharge, I'd expect more than 7 rings.

Overall, I was satisfied enough with the meal, the place is also close enough from home to be able to walk and pick up food.  I looked at their menu again and tried to calculate the price to be around $39, and couldn't get it to that price. I then remembered they were also on just-eat.ca.  I used their system to calculate the delivery price, so I could see the charge for delivery and for the onion ring upcharge. The amount came up to $39.36, HOWEVER the price per combo is $12.95 each, not $10.98 as listed on their website.  I had them at ***, but the pricing felt like a bait-and-switch, which made me sour on the whole experience.  Due to this, I took an extra point, and I'm not sure if I'll order or pick up from them in the future.  Shame..."}
{"text":"OK, this is the hardest place to review for me because depending on the day, this place can get a 5 star review or a 1 star review. 
I'm going to give this place a 4star because at it's best, this place IS the best wing place in the city. These wings are so unbelievable tasty. Crispy on the outside, moist and meaty on the inside. This is TWC at it's best. 

Unfortunately you NEVER know what you are going to get at this place. Small wings or big wings? A mix of some gigantic wings and some tiny wings? Do they have fryers and roasters or just fryers or just roasters? Is it 50% more wings everyday or just on Monday/Tuesday? Do they even do 50% more wings anymore? 
NO CONSISTENCY! 

The wings here are always tasty, even when they are tiny, but it is very disappointing when you open the box to find tiny wings when a week ago, the wings you got where the size of a small child."}
{"text":"Loved the wings. They're big and tasty. I got 10 buffalo and 10 BBQ chipotle. The buffalos were good but I really liked the chipotles. Ask them to suggest something that fits your taste. With 40 flavours you won't go wrong. You'll be greeted with smiling faces and helpful staff."}
{"text":"I was excited about trying their wings, and had been meaning to stop in for a while.  I placed my order through Just eat and began to eagerly await my wings...and wait...AND wait.  Finally almost two hours later my food arrived.

When I mentioned this insane wait time to the driver he laughed and asked why I hadn't just ordered through them directly...no apology nothing.

I am incredibly disappointed as I'd hoped that this would be the positive experience I'd been hoping for to end a bad day....clearly my mistake!

Never again!"}
{"text":"I am happy to say that the regular size wings are back (called fryers) and even extra big wings (called roasters) are available too!  Lots of flavour choices...I had spicy BBQ Honey Garlic (perfect blend of spicy and honey garlic) with the sweet potato fries.  Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Got the bacon-wrapped wings and was incredibly disappointed by how dry they were. Do not recommend. Two stars because the fries and sweet potato fries, though nothing special, were decent."}
{"text":"I placed a delivery order and was told it was going to take 45 minutes to an hour. The order taker was supposedly experiencing problems processing not one but two credit cards of mine which were completely fine and mentions that my payment will be processed at the door via debit. An hour goes by with no sign so I give them a call. I was told that the order left 20 minutes ago, and we are within a 10 minute walk. When I registered my concern for the lateness, I was told to \"relax\". Unbelievable. The driver finally showed up close to an hour and a half after I had placed the order. By this time we were getting ready to sit down to tuna sandwiches we were forced to make out of sheer hunger, so I turned him away. Completely unacceptable service. If I find unexplained charges on my credit card bills I will be updating this review. Avoid at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"Deserves less than 1 star. Customer service is awful! 
We ordered 20 wings and two sides to accompany an event we were watching, we were told delivery would be an hour or less...longer than you'd expect but I was willing to wait an hour. 1.5hr later still no delivery person showed up so we called in and were told \" it's a busy night it will take 1-1.5hr\", its already been over their maximum estimated time! 
We ended up cancelling the order while receiving less than poor customer service on the phone. 
With so many wing places in Toronto there is no excuse for such poor service.

P.S. Never asked not to pay for my order, but surely asked for a discount when forced to call back and inquire about my order."}
{"text":"Love this place! Wings are always perfect, havent tried that many different flavours, got stuck on Smoked lime and tequila and just loving it."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for hot and suicide wings, side fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings and the vegetarian burger. My daughter lived the burger and raved about the peppers on it. The side were all crispy and the grease was minimal (I hate when fries are soggy). They arrived in paper bags and none of them bags had grease marks. The wings were great. Super saucy and flavourful. They were just as good the next day too."}
{"text":"I never liked wings until I had Duff's.  Duffs was #1 in my heart.  I have to say that The Wing Company is pretty good competition.  It's been mere hours since I've had their wings and I can't get them off of my mind.

The flavours here are amazing!  I expanded my horizon by not going for the honey garlic and ordered the BBQ mesquite and hubby got the signature hot mustard wings.  Both flavours were delicious.  I also like the option that you have a choice of spicy chipotle on top of dill or blue cheese sauce.  Go for the chipotle.

AND the wings come with fries and Monday and Tuesday are specials so we got extra wings too.

I'll be coming back here again for sure.  Save yourself the wait in line at Duff's and check this place out."}
{"text":"It was a happy day for my family when a new wing joint opened up in our hood this month.  We popped in there for some takeout Sunday night and were more than delighted.  I couldn't go in because we had the dog, so the 3 of us peered in at the menu from outside.  Surprisingly, the woman working there came outside and handed us a pamphlet so we could more easily decide on our order.  Nice service!

The real challenge here is actually choosing what type of sauce to get.  There are over 40 choices, from traditional (BBQ, Buffalo, and Thai Chili) to the more interesting (Guinness, sea salt and malt, and lime).

Finally, we went with 10 Orange Ginger Zinger wings, and 10 hot wings.  We also got fries with our orders, and upgraded one of them to a poutine (which was only 2.50).

The wings:   Crispy, generously saucy, and tangy.  The hot was hot.  The owner told us that the orange ginger flavour was a bit controversial, but we both loved it.

The poutine:  Nice size, lots of gravy, thick cut fries.  The curds were good, but I would have enjoyed a few more of them.

The service: Great!  So friendly, and willing to offer advice on their many choices.  The woman also brought our order outside to us in the freezing cold.  The menu offered onion rings, cheese sticks, and other yummy looking stuff.  

Bonus:  Veggies and dipping sauce!  Among the flavour choices: Chipotle and Dill...my fav!!!

Our order of 20 wings, poutine, fries, 2 veggies and 2 dipping sauces came to a ridiculous $24.27.  I'll definitely be back to sample some more flavours and sides!"}
{"text":"wings were pretty meaty, breaded, and saucy.

tequila lime was good, but curious to try some of the hotter ones.

can't say i was mesmerized by the flavor but i think it was above average

,"}
{"text":"Very rarely am I surprised, and even MORE rarely am I pleasantly surprised. The Wing Company, with its welcoming hole in the wall atmosphere it has done just that.  Blink and you'll miss it, or possibly thinks its a dry cleaner (it's just that small).

Inside the layout is simple and effective. 1 counter, 1 open to view kitchen, stools, raised tables and most importantly the menu. Lots of flavours, and the two I had on my first ever visit make me want to try the entire line up.

It is important to note, I'm a fan of Duffs wings. However I find them pretty greasy. The Wing Company's product didn't feel anywhere near as bad, and the real winner here is flavour. Duff's flavours are pretty basic but very good. The Wing Company's flavours are unique and excellent (based on my sampling). Actually, I don't know if I have a reason to go back to Duff's now.

Now for the best part. I ordered 20 wings on a Tuesday and they give me a bag that must have had 30-35! That my friends is a flirtatious promotion. I'm going to go there every week until I'm too fat to squeeze into my elevator. It'll be pimpin'."}
{"text":"When I've ordered from this place, they were late, and the orders were wrong. Had to jump through rings of fire to get them to fix it. Great wings, horrible service.  I want this place to be better so very badly."}
{"text":"I have returned to The Wing Company and I have to say the big roasters are back, the sauce is right well the ones I picked..lol and the portion of fries were up to snuff...this place is now on my list of wings to get especially since they deliver...Good Job Wing Company..I recommend Hot and Spicy BBQ some real kick to it"}
{"text":"The delivery is so slow, took an hour to bring my food. The burger was only ok, the lettuce  and bun had gone kinda mushy. The wings are amazing but there needs to be a dry wing option."}
{"text":"Amazing wings and they're always so big. I usually get the sweet tequila wings. The best seller. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Delivery order took 90 mins. 

Fries and onion rings were your basic frozen variety. 

The burger also didn't seem to be \"homemade\" but was still tasty. 

We ordered chicken wings (medium and bbq blue flavour) and they had good flavour. They were a bit dry but that could have been from the delivery delay."}
{"text":"I was walking back from Baker Bots. This place had a Samosa special listed outside. It said Spicy vegetarian Samosa. I decided to try. Asked for 1. Ended up buying 2. Was pleasantly surprised. Very close to an authentic Samosa. Spicy and they heat it up too. Delicious. 

Will go back for Wings. The lady there told me they are known for their wings. A place that can get a Vegetarian Samosa right is definitely worth a visit for their actual advertised fare."}
{"text":"Worst wing place ever.  Should've read Eva H's review.  Wings were heavily battered and tasted like cardboard."}
{"text":"After the last review, circumstances changed. There was correspondence, and we decided to try again. 

Full Order:

# The Wing Man
# 25 Roaster Wings
# 13 Salt & Malt Vinegar
# 12 Buffalo Mild
# Fries
# Veggies & Dip
# 2 Brownies
# 2 pops -- upgraded to Boylan's soda (Black Cherry and Orange - POINTS HERE!!)


The husfriend found the wings to be more enjoyable, flavour was evenly coated. Very nice. Meat was tender and definitely 'meaty'. :D -- His words. :) Thumbs up!

I found the Salt and Vinegar with a good flavour this time. They were not just 'plain' wings as of last time. Even my roommate, A, said, \"Why does it smell like Salt and Vinegar in here o.0?\" This is a good sign. :) You got the beautiful salt and sharp vinegar with every bite. Yum. 

Our order came with the regular sized fries, which were really enjoyable. It's a shame that they come in such a small quantity. The roommate, G, really enjoyed them and did so by sneaking along and grabbing a few!

The amazing thing was that Rob (the founder) had also included some sauces for us to try (garlic and onion free, for the husfriend). We got BBQ Honey, BBQ Peppercorn, and their Tequilla Lime sauce. We have instantly fallen in love with the peppercorn sauce and highly recommend it. Next rated would be the Tequilla Line. Honey wasn't too intense. I like my flavour sharp. It's just me, but the honey could be really nice. 

VERDICT:

The husfriend says that he would love to order from here again, as long as the quality remains the same. Wings, Burgers, Meaty meat, and Fries are the husfriend's main food groups (and he still only weighs about 140lbs -- he has severe allergies). The only thing that he would change would be the amount of fries. The portion of fries that is given is 5oz. The average single potato weight (before frying) is approx. 8 oz. Essentially, we're each given our own single potato. I respect the portioning in a world of fast food where we don't know how to stop, but for a man who loves his french fries, they weren't enough. :( 

I would order from here again. The customer care was amazing this time around and I give kudos to those that deserve it. ROB, KUDOS! :D I will remember you guys when I have a large party next time, especially for pizza and wing night!



4.5/5

0.5 taken for the size o' the fries. :( 


Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Wings here are tasty but unfortunately they use MSG is their sauces. Boo. I'm looking forward to Wild Wings opening on King Street."}
{"text":"I just wanted to give an update to say that I still think this restaurant has the best wings in my neighbourhood. I've tried I Wings, and Just Get Wings, and a couple of other places and they aren't as good. The delivery is usually on time, and the driver (it's always the same person) is very friendly."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me but the wings here don't seem that big. They are, however, pretty tasty, though none of the sauces are hot enough for me (nothing approaching Death or Armageddon at Duff's)...seriously, they offer all these sauces and can't just create one that is actually really, really hot? Also, the wings come with far too little sauce on them.

These are both correctable (I did ask for more sauce once and there was a *little* more sauce on them), but as it stands I prefer Duff's or even Puck N Wings (which are overly fried, but much bigger and saucier)."}
{"text":"The wings are good, really good.  Check them out.  Ideally get a few wing lovers together and get a few different of 40+ flavours.  You need to take-out or get delivery if you want beer with your wings.  Monday or Tuesday get 50% more wings for same price.  I'd definitely return.  That's the bottom line.

I decided to check out this place, eating in, after a verbal, effusive recommendation at the last Elite event from Kelly O. as well as the further very positive Yelp reviews.  On to the bullet point list!

Pros:
+ Clearly the wings (meaty and crispy).  I decided to get the Smoked Lime & Tequila flavour (delicious) after 5 minutes inspecting the menu.  
+ Wings were pretty saucy which I don't normally like but in this case was great because the sauce was really good.
+ Lots (well, at least 39) of other interesting sauce choices.
+ Pleasant, cheerful service... finally offered me a sample of one of the wing flavours after much hemming and hawing about what to get (designed to generate aforementioned sample... probably could have just asked for one).
+ Clean and well organized layout with plenty of condiments available.
+ They have the big wet-naps (like a towel).

Cons
-  Unlicensed.  Has to be mentioned if you want to compare to Duffs/ St.Louis/etc.  I really wanted a beer.  Or put another way you really only want to take-out or get delivery.
- Small location - 10 seats.  Back to the take-out or delivery.
- Tried to upsell me to Boylan's soft drink instead of diet pepsi... bush league.
- Fries were a little underdone, but edible.
- Celery was a little on the white-ish side."}
{"text":"I'll prelude my review by saying that I did not order actual wings from this place. And there is no way in hell I am ever going to do so. I wanted pizza and sides and they looked like they could handle it.
I found this place's flyer among the regular litany of pizza pizza, dominos and chinese food menus in my mailbox. The boneless wings were supposed to come with \"fries, veggies & dip\". And the pizza sounded like a good deal - a \"party sized\" pep for $14? Sure, why not? I'll tell you why not.

We called and ordered. We upgraded the fries in the boneless wings to poutine for an extra $1.98. delivery time was supposed to be 1 - 1.25 hours. The food arrived in just over an hour - okay. We attacked the poutine first. The fries were store-bought frozens (mccain shoestrings?) with bland gravy and what appeared to be slices of cheese. It was cold and unappetizing. Next we opened the box of \"boneless wings\" which were essentially dark meat chicken nuggets (about 30% of every nugget was breading) drizzled with a bit of sauce. Also cold and unappetizing. Oh, and no veggies were included.
Next was the pizza. By the time we opened it, the cheese had already started turning orange and the whole thing was below room temperature.

So I call to let them know about this. The girl who answers tells me that the pizza was made less than an hour ago and that it can't possibly be cold. Then I tell her about the missing veggies and an argument ensues which ends up with me giving the manager English lessons (he doesn't seem to have any problem with the language). The girl had told me earlier that \"we noticed customers wanted more wings and weren't interested in veggies so we changed it so we give more boneless wings and no veggies\". I repeatedly told her that the menu begs to differ. She, also seemingly a native English speaker, didn't seem to see it my way and first said that I'm looking at an old menu. I told her that I received it in my mailbox that day and that the menu stapled to my delivered order was the exact same. The manager tried the same kind of bs on me, telling me they have different versions of the menu. I'm not an idiot and I'm not a sucker and I'm not out to get hosed by some people who don't know how to run a \"restaurant\". For the record, there is no other menu. The website even says the same thing. I demanded my money back on the pizza so that I can walk a minute to the pizza pizza and get a pie. He told me that he will not send a driver \"just to give me my money back\" and that I could \"walk in with my food and get my money back\" if I'd like. (I wish the weather was better so I could call him on his bluff).

He then offers to bring me a new pizza. At this point I'm no longer hungry and want to cut my losses, so I agree. He says nothing about veggies, nothing about wings. he does assure me, though, that the pizza \"is being made right now\" and that the \"driver will come to [me] right away without going anywhere else\". I hang up and am boiling with rage at this point.

The pizza takes longer than the original order to arrive (over eighty minutes). The driver hands me the pizza and a bag of veggies (two tiny celery sticks and two tiny carrots). At this point we have no appetite but I have a slice of the pizza anyways. Gross. the dough wasn't fully cooked, the cheese was almost non-existent, the sauce was too sour and was all I could taste.

The manager tells me that they're not a huge corporation like pizza pizza and that they're a small operation at some point during our \"conversation\". With this kind of product and service they'll be a small operation no more.

Smarten up!"}
{"text":"Well, I walked in here last night for a treat and didn't realize it was the same place I hadn't liked previously because I was a bit tipsy. I was pleasantly surprised. I'm glad I gave them another shot. 

Great poutine! My beer-drinking buddy and I ordered a large poutine to go to eat on our glorious couch of shame. The woman asked if we wanted extra cheese, easiest up-sell ever. Real curds, dark and rich gravy, crispy fries. Dee-lish. 

It's a bit of a dingy old-school take out counter, but it's clean and does everything it should do. They have a large delivery zone, so if you're in the mood for simple poutine done right you should holla at them through just-eat.com."}
