{"text":"I've been going here every 2-3 years since I was first introduced to it back in 1999, and each and every time has literally been a gastronomic heaven.  I only wish Alberta can introduce something even 1/2 as interesting as La Domaine de la Templerie.  Imagine a farm, following the 100 mile rule where as virtually everything is sourced from 100 miles around from local farms.  Fresh vegetables, ducks, chickens, ostridge, boar and so on... and all of impeccable quality.  Then combine that with an idealic atmosphere complete with pool and lots of natural grounds to cover and even a working farm for the kids to explore.  Finally. that farm has a classically trained chef in french cuisine, and knows exactly what to do.  More importantly, all of this is your domain for ONLY you and your guests (around 12-30 people) for the afternoon or the evening, for a 8-10 course gourmet feast.  This is la Domaine de la Templerie, and it's probably the closest to foodie heaven that I've ever encountered as it's not just to foodie deal... but it's the complete package.  Everyone dines in a classic old home (it's also a bed and breakfast) of wood timbers and iron stoves.  The classic oak tables, the fine china, with the subdued lighting, and so much more... it's just so absolutely marvellous.  Do NOT eat before the trip from Montreal to get there.  Do be prepared for one awesome experience that will absolutely dazzle you.  It's a bucket list dinner people.  Get your group and don't miss your chance."}

They kept a lot of object and decoration from early 20th century. The dishes was amazing and i like it that the meat come from the animal they have there."}
