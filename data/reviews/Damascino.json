{"text":"As good as it simply gets in Middle Eastern cuisine in Cleveland.  Imagine sitting in the warm kitchen of a family in Damascus , Syria.  The lamb and rice special served up piping hot , and worthy of a chapter in a timeless culinary book of days.  My wife  who is not usually a falafel fan , agreed that the Damascino take on this ubiquitous standard was as fresh and moist here and served with a generous salad to boot.  Her Ayran yogurt drink was piquant and served with romaine leaf and cucumber slices.   Homemade baklava topped off a fine dinner.  Affable host Sam Ali is a fine host and his grocery store is well stocked and fairly priced."}

{"text":"A must for Cleveland.  I love this place.  Everything I have had has floored me.  This is also a great spot for a group.  Get some family style shared dishes and be prepared to be delighted.  Hummus is some of the best I have ever had.  If you order take out you can walk around the store and find some nice ethnic delights for your pantry."}
{"text":"Damascino is a Mediterranean market with a newly opened restaurant in the back that serves excellent Syrian cuisine. My father arrived yesterday from NY and I wanted to treat him to a nice Father's Day dinner. We were going to eat at one of our usual Middle Eastern food stops on Lorain. We decided on Damascino which was a great decision. The food was outstanding. The staff was very kind and generous. The shawarma sandwich was the standout. The tabouli, grape leaves and kibbeh were delicious as well. We had the chef's tasting which was dish after dish of deliciousness. There were a few that I have never tried before which was a real treat. One of them was a warmed tomato dish that was perfect for a summer day. They treated us to a nice tropical fruit smoothie and a fruit salad with honey and nuts. This was a meal I will never forget and was glad to share it with Dad. We were both so full from the feast that we struggled to walk to the car. Damascino is a great addition to neighborhood with so many wonderful Middle Eastern options."}
