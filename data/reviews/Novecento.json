{"text":"Really like the place. Very nice staff and great coffee"}
{"text":"Best prosciutto sandwiches in the city and the espressos are amazing. Don't get me started on the gelato, makes me want to be a fat kid."}
{"text":"Old style cafe. Nice setting with good polite and friendly customer service. Nice place with a good out door patio.   Now for the real thing. The coffee here is very good. We tried the latte and double espresso. Both were of high quality brewed to perfection.   They have ice cream and some other things to eat as well. The kids tried the strawberry and vanilla ice cream and they loved it.   Overall highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not much to say, service wasn't that great but the food definitely made up for that. It's located in a very romantic area especially at night (perfect for dates) and the crepes and gelato...yum! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I came here on a dead evening and only had a tea, so I can't say anything about the sandwiches (though they looked good). Service was great and there's free wifi (ask for the password).   My only problem is that they didn't carry loose leaf tea (to be fair, I didn't ask, I just assumed), but hardly anyone does."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely a treat!  Why I say this? This \"cafe\" is a bit on the expensive side so when I say \"treat\" its because I've either had a really good week and think I deserve to go there or because I've had a really bad week and think I deserve a little pick me up! lol  The desserts are in a beautiful glass fridge that turns and makes your mouth water with every new dessert that rounds the corner.  Their glass counter is filled with very very yummy sandwiches (or how us italians like to say it \"sangwiches\") from veggie filled to cold cut filled panninis.  Their gelato is a taste of italy that I really really miss! and their expressos are just right!    The ambiance? well again this place make me feel like i'm in italy minus the 8 hour flight and with my favourite italian artists playing in the background - what more can I ask for? hmmm how about another shot of their expresso? lol"}
{"text":"If ever I forget the theme to The Godfather, I take the streetcar down to Novecento, in one of Toronto's Italian neighborhoods, St. Clair and Dufferin.  The instant I walk into this little, European cafe, the music inevitably plays in my head as I walk toward the coffee bar being leered at by aged Italian men sipping their espressos and wondering why this 'mangia cake' (derogatory term for whitey) is infiltrating their Italian Utopia.  The gawkers don't bother me because I know I am about to sip on far and away the best Cafe Latte in the city.  The place also offers a number of Italian desserts and Paninis (made from Capicolla, Bufallo mozzarella, asiago, etc.) that look as if they've been flown from Italy directly to your plate."}
