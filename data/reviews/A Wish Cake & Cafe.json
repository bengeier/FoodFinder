{"text":"I ordered a cake for a friend's birthday well in advance. What I asked for is not what I got. They clearly forgot about my order and threw it together last minute as I had to wait for it a half hour after my scheduled pick up time. It looked like a two year old decorated it. Extremely disappointed to say the least. I will never use their services again."}
{"text":"All their cakes are basically sponge cakes and are the cheap kind you could buy at superstore. Got the chocolate mocha cheesecake that was just a  sponge cake :/ v bland taste and not worth 4 bucks at all.  Service was v slow and I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Cake was good but can't comment anything on their service. Ordered a cake 3 days ago on the 22nd and the staff told us to pick it up anytime on the 24th. We went on the 24th same staff told us they haven't made the cake yet. Waited for a while and we didn't check on the cake when we received it. We got home and opened the box realized the side of the cake was a bit crashed somehow. There was no cream or icing inside the box or anything so it wasn't our fault. They packed a damaged cake without telling us. The cake tasted great but disappointed at their service."}
{"text":"Went for the first time with my hubby to try their chocolate cake for I was craving it.. We tried the Sacher torte and we think it's ok but not quite chocolaty and my taste bud wasn't satisfactory. Then we tried the Oreo mocha slush and it's ok too? You can taste the espresso more than the Oreo. We just also hope that they would speak and understand more English. So far the atmosphere is great, well organized and looked professional."}
{"text":"A Wish Cake & Café is so close to work that I MUST try it.  Raspberry Mousse Cake Had this for Mother's Day and my family and family friends loved it! It wasn't too sweet, it was fluffy and moist. Unfortunately, I decided to take the bus home that day, so the layer of cake was a little wet from the one hour bus ride home...but that wasn't the café's fault. The cake portion had a very eggy taste. It tasted like those chinese yellow egg cakes. Overall, we really liked this cake, everybody had seconds and thirds. Highly recommended!  Tiramisu Bought a slice of Tiramisu to try as well. It was rich, but it was a little on the sour side. Not the best one I've had, but definitely not the worse.   Green Tea Mousse Cake My brother loves green tea, so decided to try this one for his birthday. Unfortunately it wasn't that good. The green tea was really strong. It had the fishy green tea taste to it. Should have saw it coming with green tea cakes...I would definitely pass on this one. However, this time the layer of cake wasn't wet. The cake was moist and soft.  Finally tried their bubble tea last week, ordered the mango lychee slush with pearls. It was made with syrup so it was a little too sweet (too much syrup). The pearls were a little frozen from the slush. It did satisfy my bubble tea craving though and definitely better than Destination. Their bubble tea selection is very limited and they have maybe a handful of fresh fruit juice (haven't tried yet). Although I was quite shocked that they do not have watermelon on their list of fresh fruit juice. Considering that is one of the easiest drinks to make, quickest too!!  I really like their uniforms; it gives it a little taste of Hong Kong. They are very tidy and nice. The employees there are very nice, friendly and helpful.   I got the 15% off VIP card when they first opened at the beginning of May, so the cakes were around ~$28 with tax and tip. The drinks were ~$4 after the discount."}
{"text":"I really have mixed feelings about this place...I feel like its a hit or miss.   The first time I had their cake it was at my birthday. My friend had brought me a mango mousse cake, and it was absolutely delicious.   However, after that I went to their bakery and tried out some of the cakes pieces they sold. I've tried their coffee cake, in my opinion that was rather dry. I've also tried their blueberry, strawberry, and lemon cakes and they tasted mediocre. I also bought my friend a chocolate cheesecake for her birthday and again, it was mediocre in taste.   Recently, my friend and I bought another cake from them, and that was extremely disappointing. We ordered their chocolate cake, which looked absolutely beautiful in their picture. Unfortunately when we picked up the cake, it looked nothing like what we ordered. The cake was suppose to have a smooth dark chocolate layer on it along with chocolate shavings and a center piece in the middle. Instead, it looked like a cheap Co-op/Safeway chocolate cake...talk about false advertisement! The taste of the chocolate cake wasn't bad, it was not too sweet. But other than that I was quite disappointed.   The pricing of their cakes are more on the pricey side, and based on the last two purchases I cannot say that it was worth the price. You are looking at a price range from about $30 to $80 per cake, depending on the shape and size (the size is dependent on how many people you want to feed). There are also additional charges if you want a customized cake.   The bakery itself has a nice and clean setup, and a friendly atmosphere. It is spacious with room for in store eating. They have a fair amount of cake selections and they also sell buns and milk tea there as well."}
{"text":"This place was such a cute little find for me! The interior is decorated lovely, simple and chic. There is large menu of bubble teas and a huge variety of cakes,  pastries and cookies.  Sit in the back if you want to see the chefs make all these treats through a glass window."}
{"text":"This is a great little bakery in downtown Calgary. While I'm traditionally more of a fan of French bakeries, this shop didn't disappoint even though it was something different. I stopped in after lunch to grab a treat, and they had a great selection of desserts to choose from. I grabbed a slice of chocolate cake and also a bag of rose cookies -- both of which were delicious, but I really should have stocked up on the cookies... it's a week later and I'm still craving them. Service was friendly and event though I didn't say, cafe was clean and well maintained. Great stop!"}
{"text":"I've always noticed this bakery but never really thought about going in... and then a friend had mentioned that they have Asian style desserts plus ramen now available! Weirdest combo ever right, but if it taste good, then it doesn't matter! So a couple of weeks ago a friend and I picked up some cake and decided to return another time for their ramen because we have already eaten lunch that day.    So first off, the cake.  There is a buy 3 get 1 slice free deal so we split 2 slices each. I went with the Japanese cheesecake and the red velvet slice and quite enjoyed them.  The Japanese cheesecake was moist, fluffy and not overly sweet.  The red velvet slice was a touch dry but it had nice flavor and wasn't overly sweet as well! My friend like the Japanese cheesecake as well but thought the green tea mousse slice was a bit tame.  Today we went back for the ramen.  The lady who worked there told us that it is made from scratch (at least the broth was as far as I can tell because the noodles seemed factory made, but I could be wrong).  I got the tonkotsu and she got the curry.  It was a really long wait for the ramen and at least it came out hot.  It was garnished with a few slices of chashu, some seaweed sheets, veggies and half an egg.  The broth was ok, not too flavorful but the chashu was deliciously tender.  The noodles were bouncy and not overcooked.  Overall, it was an ok bowl of ramen for $9.49.  We also decided to finish with a Portuguese egg tart ($1.39) and that was surprisingly good - flaky tart shell with that nice, jiggly custard filling.  I could use a few more of those!  I love supporting local businesses but I think this place really needs to kick it up a few notches.  I understand that it's a café and not a full service restaurant per se but it wasn't very busy at lunch and the lady seems like she needed some help to speed things up.  I would definitely be back though and hope next time we won't have to wait over 30+ min for ramen."}
{"text":"They have hot bubble tea which is so good also roll cakes are soft.but their bathroom is not always clean it's disappointed."}
{"text":"This café is right across my building in downtown. Quiet place to have chitchat with friends over a  cup of organic teas and a slice of cake.  I pretty like their cakes. I prefer to get here not too late in the afternoon as cakes get drier when it sits longer. Friendly lady pastry chef at the counter"}
{"text":"The stawberry cheese cake I got was not so fresh. I also got 2 kinds of cookies ( panda and earl grey), they all had an oily taste!!! Perhaps I had bad luck that day? I give it 2 stars is because the shop looks kind of cute."}
{"text":"Their cakes are DELICIOUS. Their coffee ... hmmm ... needs improvement ... A LOT! (-1 star) Service: good/great. Venue: great location, welcoming, clean. I'll try their coffee soon again, see if I can up their stars! ;)"}
{"text":"Extremely expensive and all their cakes are made from sponge cakes. The icings and whipped creams have that industrial chemical aftertaste to them.  The coffee is a good deal in the morning at $1 for any size, the staff is friendly, and their bubble tea is tasty."}
{"text":"Two part review coming up, since I visited twice, once for breakfast once for after work snacking.  I was pretty amped for this borderline downtown cafe, dessert that's few steps from work. How awesome! I've driven by many times and thought 'what a sweet looking cafe, look at all the lovers sipping coffee, sharing dessert *sort of jealous face.*   Got my caramel macchiato here and it was very good. Good if you love 20 packs of sugar good. It was a go go go kind of morning. They don't have soy.  Second visit, I visited by car. What a horrible idea. There is no parking on the street side, and if you turn onto 6th there are only a few that are occupied by the apartment complex. If you can make that 4 lane merge, there's also a few on that side of the street too.   Lunch hour is pretty busy, but most people are getting their orders to go. I ordered the Rose Milk Tea, that I had to ask to have water added to dilute the sugar. They have pressed grilled tuna sandwiches!!! $5 (really good price for downtown). The cake selection was abundant, and hard to choose one. I had a slice of the chocolate swiss roll cake and it was good. More cake then there was cream though.   If you are looking for a quiet place to have a initimate conversation over some coffee, this would be perfect. Slice of cake to share? Atmosphere is great, with ceiling to floor windows that let you watch the dt traffic and world go by. Food is ok, everything else being over sugared to my tastes though.

{"text":"I thought this little cafe was average at best. They have cute treats and desserts but the staff aren't very friendly or helpful. I picked up some lavender cookies for the week and they were pretty good, nothing fantastic though. I agree with some of the other reviewers that say this place is either hit or miss.. and I feel like I fell somewhere in the middle. Perhaps it's because I visited this downtown bakeshop on a weekend. I'd be willing to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"First of all, the Raspberry Mousse Cake is a winner.  I tried a slice today and even though I love a good sugar rush, this cake was still delicious despite the fact that they create low fat and low sugar goods.  I'm very picky about raspberry and was grateful it didn't taste like some nasty fake flavoring.    I really like the cafe because it is all windows and not only do they have window seating, one wall is actually windows to the kitchen and you can watch the baker in action.    The majority of what is sold here is deserts but they do have a bit of a lunch selection as well, such as toasted sandwiches, soup and a variety of buns.  Most items are made in-house and a few packed treats are not.  They have a respectable drink menu with teas, slush, smoothies, brewed coffee and espresso, none of which I tried.    I'll definitely return when I'm in the neighborhood again and would consider ordering a cake, but for a special occasion only.  They are like artwork, therefore pricey.  Check them out online.

{"text":"I always stop in to this cute little bakery whenever I'm walking past! I love the Earl Grey cookies & the Lavender cookies. Clean store, friendly service, delicious treats = a-Ok in my books!"}
