{"text":"I've been to Falafel at various times and days but the service remains consistently good. It usually takes just over 5 minutes for me to get my meal and never more than 10. The cost for a full meal - e.g. a bowl of soup, a sandwich, and a drink - is pretty good (~$10), and they have daily specials which are even cheaper. I've not had a bad experience here.  My only complaints, albeit minor, are a) that the sandwich wraps tend to be a little juicy/greasy for my liking; b) they generally won't bring you refills unless you go to the front counter or ask them as they walk through the dining room."}
{"text":"When i ordered kibbeh, they told me i had to pay extra for sauce. WTF. every lebanese/middle eastern restaurant ive been too sells the kibbeh with a yogurt sauce or tahini of some kind. FAIL"}
{"text":"WWW yeah he mighty falafel cafe. This place is frickin awesome wig cheap prices, big portions, and excellent tasting food. From their gyros to their chicken sandwiches, all of that stuff us great. Only downside would be the service but whatever you didn't come for that aspect."}
{"text":"I have been eating here regularly for the past 3 years and I love it!  The portion sizes are great, and the food is always fresh.  I've also used them for small catering jobs.  All staff are incredibly friendly and  I would definitely recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"As someone who grew up with middle eastern food, this place is far below par.  Not only are the flavors bland, and just plain wrong to those who are familiar with the cuisine, but also, it is not worth the prices that he charges. While it is relatively inexpensive, it's still not a fair price for the quality.  Most of the food is greasy, and the fries that seem to come as a standard side are awful.   As a  side-note, he treats his workers awfully as a standard, from what I can tell. Not only is he constantly yelling, but also one would expect something like this when the place is busy, not when the place is practically empty.   The only positive to the place is the remodeling he has done in the last year or two.  Long story short, this place is just a complete disappointment, even from the view of a local college student (we tend to be more tolerant, is my understanding)."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for a conference and in my quest to support local businesses, while expanding my culinary horizon, I opted for Falafel cafe (middle Eastern) instead of the restaurant chain across the street. My mum always said \"better the devil you know than the angel you don't\".  I had a chicken pie and beef pie to go. Both tasted like sawdust wrapped in leather, with a dash of salt for good measure, n assault on my taste buds. I would rather run around Cleveland rocking a LeBron Jersey than go back or recommend Falafel."}
{"text":"Greasy greasy greasy meat. Lazy service and a rude staff who couldn't care less. Overpriced food, poor quality  I ordered the Lamb Fattouche after being rushed by the man at the counter (despite the place being empty) and I was very disappointed. $12 for a few morsels of lamb mixed into a salad. I told the man no pita, but he neglected to inform me that pita bits were mixed into the salad. So I spent ten minutes picking them out if my salad, the server walking past and ignoring my dissatisfaction. When I told him that I didn't like the meal at the end, he mocked me.  The worst part was the greasiness of the dish. I couldn't tell you how the meat tasted because it was drenched in soybean oil. Soy makes me sick and now I am sneezing. Guess what--they fry everything in soybean oil at Falafel Cafe.   Oh, and is the meat halaal? \"Don't worry about it\" said the old man to me when I asked.   I will never be going back to Falafel Cafe. There are much better deals at Chopstick across the street if you're looking for a good cheap meal."}
{"text":"I went here for several months mostly for the convenience. The food is ok. However, on several occasions I observed the owner being mean to his employees. I finally decided that it was better not to support the business."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place, but I found it to be disappointed. They serve American and Middle Eastern foods. However, the food was just ok. Large selection of different pie wraps. Everything else on the menu, I would just pass."}
{"text":"I had a chicken pie here once that was actually quite tasty (and it cost maybe 3 dollars). The falafel is not good. I should have learned not to order it after the first time but I went and did it again. I am here to tell you that the first bad one wasn't a fluke."}
{"text":"I have friends who love this place, and the food can be good. But my personal interactions with them have been not so great :("}
{"text":"terrible! the server place my order wrong 3 times and the person I was with got their food before me and he ordered two items and I had to wait each time atleast 10 mins for a simple gyro and the food is basic/not worth it and the Philly the person I was with was bad and the meat was very tough!"}
{"text":"went to the falafel cafe for lunch today. my friends have said pretty good things about this place especially the falafel sandwiches so I was really looking forward to it.   i'm sad to say that it did not live up to its hype. the falafel sandwiches were very dry and didn't really taste like anything. the fries were pretty good, though. i was only able to eat half of the sandwich and i really did want to like it. sorry but i will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We ate here twice and the food was very good but better the first night than the second. The owner was very friendly and personable. Atmosphere could be improved and modernized."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try and was quite disappointed. The place was almost completely empty except for a few other patrons, and I went at dinnertime. The beef kefta came with quite a lot of sauce and was overcooked to the point of being crispy. (And I normally LIKE crispiness in my food, but not in this case.) The falafel itself was extremely dry and not very tasty. One good thing? The staff was extremely friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this amazing place!! Love the fact that it is Zabihah and the food is very tasty and authentic!! Certified halal!! Service was great!! The quantity was more than enough!! Great seating for Niqabee sisters!! My sister wears the Niqab and we both were able to eat here comfortably!! Strongly suggest the Hummas and Chicken Philly"}
{"text":"In a Nutshell, for cheap, easy, delicious and healthy food, it doesn't get any better than the Falafel Cafe.  My only regret - Mujadara is no longer on the menu. It was divine."}
{"text":"Really low quality ingredients, hummus is dry, falafel tastes like bad oil, and anything else I've tried is not any better.  Go there if all you care about is the quantity-price ratio."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once although service was fine and the food very good. Great veggie dolmas, lentil soup and baba ganoush."}
{"text":"Not only the food is junk but moreover they are so unfriendly and cruel , we went there with kids and because one of the kids started crying we got kicked out does that make any sense , we are paying to get kicked out of the restaurant I will never ever go back there and won't recommend anyone to go there ."}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly. The food is a little bland and chicken was dry. The baklava tasted old and stale. The shawarma is good!"}
{"text":"I go to this place quite often and it has its bad points and good point they make good chicken Phillies and the French fries are good I've tried some of the other dishes and they were good too the only thing he doesn't put enough of gyro meat on sandwich otherwise it's clean and nice"}
{"text":"Would not go back again. I'm confused by the great reviews. I love mediterranean  & indian food. How authentic could it be, they serve fries with their combos? I would prefer a side of hummus, a fresh sm. salad, or some tabouli. For the price, Aladdin's offers better quality, larger portions, great peaceful atmosphere, and excellent service. I could not say the same about Falafel Cafe. We decided to check it out today for lunch. It is however a great location, and my boyfriend and I live in Cleveland Heights and frequently visit University Circle. I'd been wanting to try this place for probably a year. I'd point it out every time we drove by. Well, I was overall disappointed with both the food and service. I disliked the shishtawook sandwich. It was mushy, and bland. Not much chicken & I couldn't taste the hummos. The service wasn't excellent. The wait was long for just a couple sandwiches. I felt kind of grossed out that the bus-boy cleaned up tables, then handled our glasses and refilled our drinks. The people working there were pleasant, but they weren't busy and they seemed disorganized. The bus-boy didn't have to refill our drinks, our server should have...and I don't know what she was doing the entire time."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday to dine in for the first time since the remodel and was pleasantly surprised!   Not only were we seated, but we had quick service and the interior and atmosphere were very relaxing and enjoyable. The only problem we faced was getting water refills; we had to go up to the counter to request more water and that was a bit frustrating.  Overall, still delicious!!"}
{"text":"I tried several things from the menu and each were excellent.  It is quick, cheap, and really good.  It is not fancy inside at all, but that adds to the charm."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and excellent food! My husband is part Syrian, and this food was totally authentic and made with care by a husband and wife team. We're visiting from San Francisco and our two daughters loved everything. Definitely can recommend the hummus, kibbeh, falafel and spinach feta pie!"}
{"text":"The owner is really shady! Make sure to pay in cash and not a debit/credit card!! The owner ran my card for my check total (8.62) and put the same amount in for the tip, so my check was double the amount it was supposed to be and showed up on my pending transactions as (17.24)!! He apologized and refunded me the tip amount (8.62). The machine printed out two receipts, one of the receipts said 8.62, that was the one he gave me. The second recipes said 9.62 and he tried to cover up the amount so I couldn't see it when I asked him if I needed to sign. He quickly moved the receipt that said 9.62 away so I couldn't ask again. I just checked my bank account to make sure the refund went through and it did but I the charge for the meal went through as 10.62!!!!!! The owner charged me 2.00 extra to cover the credit card fees without my knowledge or approval!!!! Shady!!!! Bad business practices!!!!!"}
{"text":"Unacceptable. If your hungry, and by that I mean, you want more than a 200 calorie lunch, go elsewhere. Portion sizes are pathetic. I had been there 3 years ago and I was dragged back by a few friends today.  For 10 bucks plus tax I received 3 oz of romaine lettuce  1 oz of hummus 1.5 oz of \"lamb\" To top it all off, we asked multiple times for hot sauce which, not surprisingly, was not included in the bag.  Overall, I think these people are unaware of how to garner repeat customers, evidenced clearly by the paucity of humans in the poorly decorated establishment at peak lunch hours. In general, stop cheating customers, bro."}
{"text":"Great place for vegetarians. Was my go-to place for lunch when I lived around that area.   Food is a hit or miss for me. I am a huge fan of falafel in general. I find their falafel to be a bit on the dry side some days, and good on some others. I've mitigated that by ordering extra tahini on the side, but unfortunately they charge for that. The hummus and pita also help with the dryness. Sometimes the hummus is loaded with a bit too much oil for my tastes, which can make it kind of unappetizing. I don't know if it's just me, but their falafel has a sort of bitter taste in the actual patties. It's just....different. The prices are a bit expensive compared to the quality, and they always seem to be going up.  A plus is the remodeling he's done on the place. Before, it looked like a hole in the wall place where you would wipe the table down yourself before eating there. Now, it has booths, a new paint job and a whole overall new look. Its pretty nice. After four years of going here though, I always get confused by the counter ordering system."}
{"text":"Falafel Cafe is one of the best places to get affordable, Middle Eastern food in Cleveland.  It's right on the CWRU campus, so if you're a student, professor, or employee, you need to walk down and check this place out at least once.  Definitely get the hummus!  It's thick, with a slightly grainy texture, plenty of olive oil and garlic, and slightly spicy.  A serving of hummus alone can serve as a light lunch.  I often like combining mine with one of the lamb or spinach-and-mushroom pies, but there are some days when I'm not as hungry and an order of hummus is great.  Falafel Cafe also serves fresh soups, which combine well with pretty much everything else on the menu.  I also enjoy the service at Falafel Cafe.  When the restaurant is busy, there's definitely a pressure to know what you want right away to help the next customer.  While this might seem off-putting to people, I respect the staff's efficiency.  Plus, when you're a repeat customer, the staff is always exceedingly friendly and does a good job of remembering your favorite foods.  It's the epitome of local business.  If you're not big on Middle Eastern-style cuisine, last year Falafel Cafe introduced some American options to their menu.  I tried the burger once; it's excellent!  Even when they step outside their traditional area of expertise, they do a great job."}
{"text":"Just when I thought all falafels were the same. These had a flavorful seasoning with a little spice. Friendly attentive staff you can eat in or carry out. I enjoyed my sandwich & will come back."}
{"text":"Actual rating: 3.5 stars.   Let's start with the stars of the meal: the baba and the samosa pie. Finally. A baba ghanoosh that you can actually taste the eggplant!! Hands downs best baba I've ever had. So glad it was recommended to me by a friend. I could probably eat that for a meal, even though it's an appetizer. Second, the samosa pie is such a great price ($2.99!!!). It's a good-sized portion, but SO FILLING. Maybe it's all the starch, but I would 100% recommend.   The okra stew was listed as one of the specials on the board, so naturally, we had to try it. I've had okra before, but never like this. It was an interesting, complex flavor with a bold tomato base. The beef kefta was delicious with the grilled veggies, but it tasted just like grilled beef without any of the typical seasonings I'd expected from a beef kefta. Wish I had opted for the chicken shish tawook. We had plenty of pita bread included for our food, which was great.   Atmosphere is a bit calmer than I would expect, but they seem to keep very busy with customers who call in and pick up. I wouldn't come if you're in a time crunch to be anywhere though so keep that in mind. Service wasn't lacking, per say, but there were only two other tables occupied while we were there.   Overall, it's not the best middle eastern food that I've had, but I would definitely come back in the future to try other dishes on the menu. (Already craving the baba ghanoosh and the samosa pie!)"}
{"text":"First the good...the coffee, friendliness of staff (quick to apoligize), bathroom and overall cleanliness.   The bad...service (slow and forgetful), quality of food (poor and not fresh), menu description not matching what is served, overall menu selection, lack of sugar and general table condiments, among a few other things that escape me.  Our appetizer came out last which was the hummus,  which one would think would be a staple in such an establishment, and it was bland and gritty.  Poor selection of beverages.  The coffee excellent and fresh.  Tea came already steeped?   Have you ever heard of this, I never have."}
{"text":"Falafel is a go-to place for me on campus if I'm hungry and just need a quick bite to eat. They have fairly reasonable prices for college student fare.  I usually go with the falafel pita sandwich ($3.99), though I tried the salmon pita roll and it was pretty delicious. If I'm not really hungry, a falafel sandwich will definitely satisfy, but I like adding a side of fries to share with a friend. I definitely think the portions could be a little more generous. The potato / spinach pies are just okay -- they do the trick if you're hungry and need something to grab."}
{"text":"Don't even bother, that was not even close to Lebanese or middle eastern that was almost Mexican. The salad was tasteless!!!! The baba ganuj was terrible!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the falafel wrap and was wildly disappointed by how tasteless it was. My order also came with fries, which were extremely soggy!   The service here is kind of awful. It took the server 30 minutes to take our orders, even though the restaurant was practically empty. The server also got my friend's order wrong and never even gave her the rice pudding she ordered.   Overall, very displeased with the experience and will probably not be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Been here for in-dining dinner and take out lunch. I've been eyeing the spinach/meat pies on display for a while now. The salads are legit! Prices have jumped a bit recently, but still a solid deal."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years, and it has changed a lot since they expanded and added more seating.  If you go at lunch it can be crazy, but I always enjoy it most when I stop in later at night. If you're in a hurry order a spinach pie, or a samosa to go, they'll heat it up."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a couple of months now, and so finally I gave it a try this past week. Being Middle Eastern, I know what these dishes should taste like and so maybe my review isn't ideal.  I went in for lunch around noon, was greeted by who may one of the owners. She was friendly and reminded me of my roots.  I ordered the falafel sandwich combo which is the sandwich (obviously), fries, and a drink. The fries are the highlight of the meal for me. They are not frozen, they are fresh potatoes, just like how mom makes them at home. They were hot and tasty. The falafel sandwich was where points were lost. It was not good at all, it tasted generic. It was also probably fried in advance as it wasn't fresh and kind of lukewarm. The pita was soft and fresh and the toppings were delicious but the falafel itself was very unpleasant for me.   The prices are really cheap, I think it was less than $8 for the entire meal. I will probably give it another try and get something else because I just want to like the place and maybe I just had a bad batch of falafel."}
{"text":"I have lived in New York, Dearborn and grew up with Arab friends, so I have sampled different ME cuisines throughout the years. I tried out this place as I recently moved to Cleveland and wanted to see how it faired. The chicken shish tawook was alright, good flavor. good amount of chicken and veggies. I would have given this place a higher rating if that is all I had. But oh boy, I made the mistake of ordering their Zaatar. It is not subtle to say the least. The bread base was rock hard, the flavor overpowering in a bad way, and aftertaste destructive. I have had other food, dessert, coffee the rest of the day and the taste has yet to go away. I only had a few bites of the Zaatar! Never again my friend, never again. Off to find another place ...."}
{"text":"What an awesome place.  It's like heaven for a real G, and by real G I mean vegetarian.  Tons of choices, prompt service, cheap pricing.  It's definitely more of a fast-food joint, though you can sit down and eat with waiter service.  The falafel sandwich is a classic and definitely worth trying out.  You could also never go wrong with an order of hummus and pita.  It's not the best falafel I've ever had (see the stand in the west-side Market), but it's pretty darn close.  I think if they'd find a way to make the falafel a bit more moist with a tad more spice, it would be just about perfect.  Definitely recommend it though.  Tip: for parking, there is a lot across the street on the east-side of the restaurant that is metered (25 cents for every 15 minutes)."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical of this place for a while because every time I walked by it there is a loud, obnoxious, industrial fan coming from the brick building which blows hit air at you that smells like grease. Needless to say, it's not very appetizing. However, one of my friends wanted to get some falafel takeout one day and I joined her. I ordered a regular falafel pita sandwich without the pickled turnip and was surprised at how good it really was! The falafel and tahini sauce were both very fresh and the veggies were crisp inside the pita. Also the french fries that come with it are thin and crispy, which is just the way I like them.  Parking is a nightmare around this area though which is a big downfall."}
{"text":"It's affordable and has lots of options, but I didn't think it was anything special. I didn't particularly enjoy the Baba Ghanouj that I got, and the restaurant in general wasn't anything I really want to go back to. If you want middle eastern food in the area, I'd recommend Aladdin's."}
{"text":"The food is good and atmosphere is friendly. Great college town lunch/dinner spot. I had a bad night, dinner date did not show. Ordered takeout and the sweet young lady working left me a kind note that I found in the bag once I got home. That made my day!"}
{"text":"Microwaved salmon specials, soggy fries, bland falafel.. Meh I've experienced better indeed.  OK, I have given this place a fair chance, went there at least 10 times within 5 years and 8/10 times have been disappointed or grossed out by something I ordered  The good (sort of): -The lamb, beef, chicken served with hummus and pita is quite tasty, has a good amount of acidity, and vigorously seasoned - only slight complaint is that it is always overcooked, even for middle eastern cuisine standards  -Hummus, they've got the texture down (not too goopy, not too thick), and I think this is one of their star menu items. Shouldve called themselves 'hummus cafe' instead. I personally do prefer it a little more acidic, and more   The bad: -Perhaps it was my because of naivety that I order salmon at a place called \"Falafel Cafe\", but hey it was their 'daily special' and I happened to be craving salmon that day. After about two bites, I discovered the middle was frozen, literally ice frozen. I sent it back, they apologized. But then .. instead of tossing it in a pan or oven, they threw it in the microwave. Im sorry, but whatever excuse you may have, you don't have 'daily specials' of frozen anything, then cook it when it hasnt properly defrosts, then microwave it to thaw. That actually made me laugh.. it was so miserable  -After not ordering any specials from them again for over 2 years (I opted for falafel wrap and their beef & hummus platter usually), I decided to give them another try. Out of stupidity, and just wanting to try something new, I ordered a fried fish patty 'daily special'. Yup you guessed it, straight out of the freezer and into the frier. It wasn't frozen this time, but it was so disgustingly greasy I couldn't finish it. This was nearly 2 years ago, and I still have not forgotten that greasy, reused oil stench in the back of my throat. Lesson learned, don't order any 'daily specials'  -The falafel wrap. For a place called \"Falafel Cafe\" you would expect the falafel to be incredible, but in all honesty, it would rank last next to Aladdins/Algebra Tea House/Mad Greek/Tommy's! It is bland as can be, dry almost without fail, and the outside never delivers on that crispiness you yearn  -The pies are mediocre, always dry from sitting day in and day out. I can't speak for what authentic lebanese pies are like, but I think it would be so much better with less bread and more stuffing. But hey, at under $3 a pop, you really can't complain. But just to let you know, if you want these pies heated, that also means microwave.. you know how undesirable microwaved pizza bread is? Well that's what happens to their pies when they zap it  All the positive review you get about this place are about how friendly the owners are (I agree), and how cheap the food is (I also agree). But being friendly and cheap doesn't mean good food and I hope they can find ways to stop taking so many shortcuts, occasionally change their frying oil, actually having FRESH daily specials, and perfecting that falafel!   Food: C- Atmosphere: C Service: B"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! I got the gyro and the meat was super tender and the naan it was served on was nicely toasted and soft. Honestly one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. I would recommend this place to anyone give their menu is diverse with vegan and meat options!"}
{"text":"I consider Falafel Cafe to be a fast-food joint, but the food is actually very tasty for what you pay. A plus, is the fact that there are plenty of vegetarian options to choose from. It is a small place, but clean and there is always room to sit down."}
{"text":"Awful, awful service. Completely ignored while employees yucked it up in the kitchen and behind the counter. The meal was unremarkable and overpriced. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Good falafel and big portions. Combo meals are a good deal. Clean and conveniently located right in the heart of University Circle."}
{"text":"Go to Aladdin's instead.  Food is better.  Service was ok until they failed to own up to their internal and external communication problem. Cashier sends you to the waitress.  You confirm with the waitress. She assures you of 1 thing.  You end up paying for something else.  Why does the customer suffer?  Establishments need to see the bigger picture.  #frustrated SMH"}
{"text":"I feel this is the spot with the best hummus. Not sure why it has a 3 star rating other then the somewhat disappointing service....my girlfriend ordered white wine which was room temp, so they brought us a cup of ice. We also waited a long while to pay as our server brought our check....and never came back so we walked to register. Not sure if that's what we were supposed to do bit it's what we had to do. Other then the stage service, the food was on point."}
{"text":"Solid effort on food. It took a little while for us to get our order in, but then it came quickly, and everything was good."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great for the quick healthy eats.  This place gets very very busy during lunch.  I advise calling in an order.  Service is good and friendly, prices are fair.  I have had the kefta sandwich, and another time had shawerma sandwich, both were perfect.  I will def come back here again."}
{"text":"Great food (especially the kebabs.)  Try the lamb, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I grabbed some takeout from Falafel Cafe after a visit to MOCA and was hoping that it would be the kind of place I would be going back to.  Located at the corner of Euclid and Mayfield Roads, FC has been there a while as the area has picked up and grown.  One half of FC is a counter with the kitchen behind, the other is a dining room which struck me as a bit run down.  I ended up ordering a falafel and a spinach and mushroom pie to take home.  The falafel was a good sized rolled pita, with nice vegies, pickles and tahini; unfortunately the pita did not hold up to the 10 minute ride home and was falling apart by the time I ate it.  The falafel balls were nicely cooked, but a bit bland; a bit of garlic or herbs would have improved the overall sandwich.  The spinach pie was large, but I couldn't really taste the mushrooms that were suppose to be in there.  The dough was decent, but the filling left a bit to be desired.   Overall the portions are good, but I found that the flavors were a bit too bland.  While conveniently located I doubt I will be heading back, since there are better options available."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had a very good sandwich of lamb and beef.  Had to pay to park. We parked in a lot across the street.  The staff seemed disorganized, but this did not affect our service at all. Our orders arrived correctly and on-time.  The restaurant is rather spartan, but in good shape."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a bite to eat. The service is very good and the food is always amazing. The Kefta is my personal favorite. Just a short walk from the Cleveland Museum of Art which is an added bonus. Can't wait for the next time."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, always courteous. Food consistently good and authentic. Great before a show at Severance Hall."}
{"text":"I ate here again during my Cleveland stay. I ordered the moussaka with rice and a Turkish coffee. I wasn't sure what a vegetarian moussaka would entail, but it turned out to be chick peas and eggplant in a tomato sauce. The eggplant was perfect and the favors were delicious, but the chick peas were terribly crunchy. They would be better off just using canned. Still a good deal, just a bit hit or miss."}
{"text":"Yummy! I tried the falafel wrap and gyro. So tasty and filling! The falafel isn't very authentic (methinks); lots of breadcrumbs"}
{"text":"In my opinion the food is very good.  It is clearly a home made menu, unlike many of the chain middle eastern restaurants.  The kibbie, humus, falafel, grape leaves, very unique and regionally influenced."}
{"text":"I and my date had a wrap, some lamb, and hummus here. All of the food was delicious, and the service was exceptionally friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Solid baba - maybe a little too much smoked paprika?  Pretty good though, we both enjoyed it.  Could definitely taste the eggplant.  The salmon wrap and falafel were both tasty.  The pita was a bit chewy, but that'll be my only complaint.  The price was right and the service was friendly - I'd go back."}
{"text":"I came here after a long day at UH.. My day just got longer and longer sitting here.  The service was so slow, rude, and just generally awful. They got both orders wrong.. And then half way through our food we saw two rat traps cleverly hidden behind a cardboard scrap. Holy crap ew!!!! Rats?! I'm out."}
{"text":"I feel like Falafel Cafe is a leftover from a few years back, when the food offerings on this stretch of Euclid consisted of abysmal pizza, nasty Chinese take out, Starbucks pastry, a very ghetto McDonalds, and this place. Among that group of contenders, I recall that Falafel Cafe seemed downright appealing: it was affordable, vaguely edible, and quick enough to grab for lunch.  Now, though, all I can notice is that the food isn't particularly authentic, the staff isn't terribly friendly, and everything is a fair bit greasier than it should be. I'm not convinced that Falafel Cafe has gotten any worse--it's just that the competition has gotten that much better.  The last time I came in, my friend and I were the only two customers and it still took a solid five minutes for someone to bother serving us. My shish taouk wrap was drowning in grease (albeit slightly tasty) and the fries were soggy. At the end of the meal, we had to go up to the counter and beg for our check, despite still being the only two customers.  Falafel Cafe needs to step up their game. With all the great new options in the Uptown district, serving \"edible\" just no longer suffices."}
{"text":"Really delicious and quick ! Great falafel and lentil soup served very hot exactly the way we like it ! Samosa's are delicious and spicy...Definitely worth a try! Very pleasant service as well."}
{"text":"Falafel Cafe gave us something that franchise restaurants didn't: the experience of enjoying home made food! It made me sense the presence of passion of the chef in the food; a feature that has usually been absent in the chain restaurants' menu for me. Overall, a great place to enjoy middle eastern food, and be taken care of by a caring chef."}
{"text":"A solid place to go for middle eastern food, and great for larger groups.  Service can be a little slow, but if you expect it it's not too annoying.  The falafel can be a little dry, but they have a nice garlic sauce and house made hot sauce (which is actually very spicy if you like it that way!)."}
{"text":"In my experience, a totally middle-of-the-road Mediterranean takeout joint. The gyros and falafel I've had here were honestly not that much to write home about, and some of the wrap sandwiches were skimpy for the price. Peeps I was with seemed to like their different meals, but the consensus was: not as good as Aladdin's or Sittoo's. Real talk."}
{"text":"I know this is not a very clean restaurant, a little \"smoky,\" and the service is not good either but I love their rice dinner with lamb though it is a little pricy. The lamb is fresh and the portion is big. Therefore, it's worth the money, $14.99."}
{"text":"After getting falafel cafe regularly, the food definitely tastes differently the past few times. We have tried giving it a couple more shots but it has not improved. I'm guessing it's under new ownership? Everything tastes so different"}
{"text":"Small joint in the city... non assuming decor... the food is another...  really good flavor.  One should definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Went there with my husband for lunch. He used to frequent the restaurant when it was at another location. We ordered hummus as an appetizer. It had so much garlic in it I couldn't eat it. The pita tasted old.  I ordered a falafel sandwich. The falafel was the worst I've ever had. It was overly fried, dry and tasteless. I'm assuming they don't use any seasoning. It wasn't even worth eating because it lacked in flavor. Husband ordered a shawarma sandwich which he was happy with (but he's not picky). We ordered a rice pudding because I didn't eat my meal. That was also very bland and very obviously wasn't fresh. There were still frozen pieces of rice in it. I will not be coming back here again. I also didn't like that the owner pestered my husband about why his parents don't go there anymore. He didn't know what to say so after she kept asking, I decided to reply for him. When I said \"they live 30 minutes away,\" she replied \"so do I and I come here every day\" in a snotty manner. Maybe they don't go there because their food is awful and the owner is rude. Go to Aladdin's or Taza for middle eastern food. It's better ambiance, flavor and service. I'd recommend Maha's cafe for falafel but they sadly closed."}
{"text":"Eh, I've tried it 2 times, not impressed.  It does make a decent lunch place to meet up and talk (since the food doesn't distract you much). The service is alright as well. The list of goods ends around there. The pies and falafels are rather tasteless. Fries are overly soft and not cook thoroughly. The wrap (shawarma) was rather good, if not entirely what I was expecting. For the price, the food is not worth it."}
{"text":"i had called in advance to see what time they close on a Sat night. The confirmed they are open till 11pm.  We got there at 10:20pm and they told us its now take out only. This was very disappointing as this was my first night ever in town and I was looking forward to sitting down and enjoying a meal.  We just ordered Falafel sandwiches and asked if we could stay and eat them inside as it was cold outside and i really didn't want to eat in the car.  The said sorry, you have to leave.  When I got back to the car i opened the sandwich to fit was cold and the falafel was overcooked.  I would NOT recommend this place based on food or customer service as they ruined my first Cleveland experience."}
{"text":"The burgers and falafel are good to get here, and I do agree that the fries are excellent. The shish tawook is tasty as well. I also agree that while the pies are inexpensive, they can be a little sketchy to eat. My friend got some zataar (flat bread covered with middle eastern spices and herbs) and it tasted and felt like it had been sitting there for a week (rock hard, no flavor)"}
{"text":"Falafel Cafe serves Middle Eastern takeout food in the heart of Case's campus. When I go there, I order one of the pita wrap sandwiches.  My favorites are the shistawook (grilled chicken with vegetables) and beef kabob sandwiches.  The falafel sandwich is average.  Makanek and kefta sandwiches are good for the price.  Not a huge fan of the kebbeh sandwich.  If you are hungry, you can buy a combo meal with fries and a soft drink, but  the fries are often soggy.  Maybe I am just spoiled by the well seasoned, crisp fries at Wolfgang Puck Express across the street.   If you're looking to take someone to a Middle Eastern restaurant for dinner, I would suggest Aladdin's.  If you just need a quick bite to eat during the workday and want to have a cheap, decent pita sandwich, then Falafel Cafe is not a bad choice. While I label this as \"takeout\" food, there is ample space to eat inside the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Easy, tasty lunch. The owner is always so friendly when I order.   This is a quick walk from my office; grabbing a spinach pie and hummus to go is quick and delicious.   While I have stopped here for dinner once or twice this is more of a lunch spot for me. The service is quick and the food tastes fresh. Order at the counter and wait there. Be advised, there is a $5 minimum on credit card transactions.   Try the grape leaves! So tasty."}
{"text":"Not bad! Tried the lamb sharma and the falafel... Nicely done  Lunch time crowd on Saturday was small"}
{"text":"Ate here as it was close to where I had to go in Cleveland. The service was great and the food was tasty and flavorful. Highly recommend this location to anyone who wants great Mediterranean Cuisine. Definitely try the Samosa or the Falaffel pitas."}
{"text":"I got the Shish Tawook wrap for a quick lunch and was blown away. Full of flavor, cheap, and fresh. I will be visiting again to try their namesake.  Word of warning though, all that flavor comes with lots of dripping and messy sauces. They will leak through the wrapper, onto the napkins, onto your shirt and set up permeant residence. Be forwarned.  But it was quick at lunch hour, and the veggies tasted super fresh. No complaints."}
{"text":"The basic falafel sandwich is rather spartan (no salad, pickles, etc.) and the falafel itself rather over-fried and dry, but it's an easy grab on the go.  They have restaurant seating and fast-food style seating too."}
{"text":"OK...the Falafel Cafe is hit or miss, but hits more often than misses. It gets  a D for decor and ambience but a B+ to an A for food. The fare is simple familiar Middle Eastern (Lebanese I guess) dishes, from shawarma (gyro) to meat pies to salads. The tables are few and the wait is short. However I regret to say that the cook on one occasion looked like he needed to take a shower, not what you want to see when ordering your food. Aside from that, the place is a hit with students on a budget from Case next door. The parking is at meters on the street or at the public lot across the street. Its a very busy and pretty much safe area between CWRU and Little Italy."}
{"text":"I got take out from here...tried the lamb pita. It was actually pretty good...I'll say I didn't have high expectations but was pleasantly surprised. It was only $7 and filling.  Seemed like a better deal than their entrees. The could use a pick me up on the decor inside, but is a place I would try again, especially for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say that I liked the service but the food was OK.  I ordered a falafel platter and the falafel came out too crispy from the outside and once I cracked the shield the interior gone pieces too easily(like if it was reheated); it was messy but tasted just ok.  However, when we asked the service if it is Halal food the lady responded angrily \"you must have seen online that it is, you don't believe it?\" and later on I saw the drinks menu(if you don't know anything about Islam and Muslims, let me tell you that alcohol products are prohibited in Islam and therefore Muslims are not supposed to sell it or buy it or consume it.)  Yes, we would eat in a non-Halal restaurant but when we ask that question we want to hear the truth so we can order based on it."}
{"text":"I give this place only two stars. The gyros are  the kabobs are good. The problem is the time you have to wait. If I call ahead and I get there 15 minutes later I expect my food to be ready not to wait an extra 25 minutes when I get there."}
{"text":"I have never tried the falafel or the gyros here (I go to the West Side Market for those). BUT the burgers are actually really good here. They have salmon burgers, too, which is a salmon patty (not a fillet). The french fries are delicious, made from scratch with the skin still on. Actually, I think it's the fries that make the burgers so good. The spinach or meat pies leave something to be desired. They're too doughy, not enough flavorful filling. It's tempting to get one because they're cheap, but they just pop them in the microwave, so I'd recommend getting something else.  oh, and I actually see middle eastern people eating here (unlike Aladdin's). So you know what that means: this place is authentic. Bonafide. Ethnic. I got a feeling that those customers aren't getting the burgers and fries. I think I saw one guy eating the hummus.  So THAT's what I'm getting next time."}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options, so I do keep going back. But my experiences have been mixed. The ordering-counter system is odd, but it seems to work, so I'll just review the food. I've had really good food here, and really dry tasteless food... and sometimes those were the same dish on different days! I find myself adding their hot sauce just for flavor and moisture... but it's super hot and a little goes a long way. So then it's dry AND the heat is the only flavor. Water.... give me water...! The bread/pastry items are the riskiest items, including, sadly the falafel.  The variety on the menu is nice, and so are the prices. I suggest avoiding the bread/pastry items and instead get things that don't look like they could possibly be dry. Some of the non-pastries are very good. (And the pastries too... sometimes.)  Parking of course is no fun in this area. Not their fault."}
{"text":"This place has fairly decent food. I usually get a shawarma sandwich with fries or hummas. The food is authentic and fresh.  My issue with this place is the service. The staff is very rude. I speak Arabic and on multiple occasions have witnessed them talking about customers. I would not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Falafel has been good in the past, but we went here for lunch today and really did not have the best experience.  They've expanded their dining room and have more room for customers now, but they clearly need to learn more about customer service.    The waitress was extremely rude to us and offered no apology about the fact that it took her 30 minutes before she took our order, and it was another hour before we got our food.  An hour and a half was more than enough time to go to any of the other restaurants nearby, which is what I'll do for lunch next time!  Really, their food is fine, but I saw many other frustrated customers waiting as well."}
{"text":"Located at a corner in a great area nearby case western. I ordered the Gyro and falafel ball. Gyro was alright, nothing special compared to other places. I will say it was pretty big which I liked the most about it. First time I had a falafel ball so can't compare to other places. I thought it was good though. Id eat it again.   This place is more like a fast food sort of dining. If you want to try on the go mediterranean, than this is for you. I'm sure theres better places though."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town and stopped in. Love the baba dip and spinach stew!  I'm always looking for tasty, satisfying vegan meals and this hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I went to Falafel Cafe a few years ago. It was a one and done opportunity. Cleveland is a tale of two cities divided by the Cuyahoga River. The Arab immigrants in Cleveland did not settle too heavily on the east side. I had my suspicions about Falafel Cafe because of that fact. I am sure the restaurant does well because of the student and hospital population. I will stick with west side places for Arab food. There is a place by Fairview Hospital called Cafe Falafel that is much better. Don't get them confused."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is not the best (the restaurant is showing age) but I always get the falafel sandwich combo and it is very tasty every time. Don't let the looks of the place fool you, this is one of Euclid's underrated eateries."}
{"text":"Don't go here for a fine dining experience.  If eating in, it can take a while to get a waitstaff's attention.  But, Falafel Cafe is perfect not-terrible-for-you, inexpensive, and fast takeout food.  The food always seems fresh and is mostly very, very good.  Their spinach and mushroom pie, baklava, and veggie pita (with yummy horseradish) are my favorites."}
{"text":"It was just a \"meh\" experience. The portion sizes were tiny.  A very small bowl of hummus with about 8 wedges of pita.  The fattoushe salad was sooo small. Side salad portion.  It was just lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, and pita. With dressing piled on top.  And the shwarma  was barely filled.  We still dropped $24 for lunch + tip.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Deeeelicious! Fabulous selection of savory pies...best tabouleh I've had. Fun place. Really nice waitstaff."}
{"text":"Nice find! Always passed this place when I went to school and 8 years later trying it for the first time. Free parking across the street. Cheap and excellent meditarranean food. Place was nice for big parties. I had the chicken fattoush salad, very fresh lots of greens. Had to ask for more sumac and lemon. It was onion overload but a nice serving amount"}
{"text":"If one wants quick and affordable Mediterranean food, I guess one could do worse... though this place is honestly nothing special.  I had been craving a felafel sandwich for quite some time and finally decided to stop in this place that I drive by nearly every day.   The wife and I both had the felafel sandwich combo with a drink and fries.  The sandwich was odd in that it seemed to have all of the correct ingredients yet tasted like nothing.  Texturally the felafel was very good, but it didn't taste like felafel.  It wasn't god awful, but mostly like eating cardboard.  It was like the spice was missing or something... unfortunately very bland.  I had such high hopes too.  The fries were pretty plain.  The service seems to be a bit disorganized.  Our server left or something and we never got a check.... everyone else did that had a different server, just not us.  Eventually we just went up and paid, but that seems like a pretty big oversite.  It wasn't TOO terrible, and I wouldn't have minded so much if the food hadn't been such a letdown.  Probably won't be back."}
