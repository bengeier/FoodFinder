{"text":"Great local place. Eat here several times a week. Staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place.  Great little spot, I really like that the satay soup can be satay or Thai flavoured.

The staff are really friendly, place is clean.

I would recommend this spot to anyone who loves a good Vietnamese lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing food at a great price! This place also offers a great atmosphere with plenty of seating for any group size which is a rare find. Eat in or take out this place is easily one of my favorite places to eat at."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants for a few reasons.

First, the food is always good. I like somewhere that is consistent and Saigon Night definitely is.

Secondly, they're super close to me. I can call and place an order, walk there 5 minutes later and it will be ready for pickup.

Third, the staff are all great. There's normally one guy who's working the front (it's a family owned business) and he's super friendly, always happy and he will remember you if you've done more than a few times so you always feel welcomed going there.

I normally get #4 and #64 - spring rolls and the tiger prawns with spring rolls rice vermicelli. So good :)

If you're around the neighbourhood, check them out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love the food and experience here. Andy the owner is amazing at running his restaurant. He is very personable and checks in with the table a few times during your meal. 
Love the food, love the options and thankful for the options to change something."}
{"text":"Finally living beside a decent Vietnamese restaurant (See my review on Pho Taurus).  Their Pho broth is quite tasty (be sure to have lots of water after as it is salty like most soups of this type).  The meet is cooked well, not too dry.

Service is decent and they also have Chinese food.  A great place to have in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Wow!  Another hitter.  I think the address may be incorrect? Food here is awesome and the owner is hands on, service is great, food is even better.  The pho is fantastic and the wonton soup is a favourite for me!  

A definite yes."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. They are so friendly, and they remember the smallest details. They definitely make you feel special when you go in. They are extremely happy, and have exceptional customer service.  Their food is divine, and I don't think I will be going to another Vietnamese place again. They definitely stole my heart through their amazing food and their amazing attitude. I strongly recommend this place if you're looking for a good vibe, good people, and good food."}
{"text":"Sweet, hole in the wall place with friendly staff, clean tasty eats. 

The shrimp salad rolls are a must!"}
{"text":"While it's not the greatest Pho in the city what really makes this place is the owner and how nice he is. They don't have a website or menus listed so I called to see if could ask if he had one item, he told me just to describe it he'd find it in the menu and he'd have it read and wait once I got there and he was true to his word! So if you want some okay Pho but truly fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and friendly atmosphere. Food quality is outstanding!  There's even a selection of bubble tea on his menu.  A great Mayland Heights gem"}
