{"text":"sort of shocked reading these reviews, i thought the place was lovely. The service was nice, the lady there was soo sweet. I ordered the sunshine salad which was very appealing and tasted as good as it looked. I came another time and got a some chile with rice and soup which I was also very pleased with. I have also catered with them a couple of times for my company and I couldn't be happier with the cattering service they provided. The food looked amazing and was right on time(we ordered the sandwich platter and pastry platter). The people at the meeting were also very pleased. Would deffinitly recommend to a friends."}
{"text":"Ordered catering for a client meeting at their office,  I was impressed... the order was delivered 15 minutes before the committed time. Sandwiches were fresh, salads were tasty, and fruit tray was great. Helpful that they offer utensils, and provided extra napkins.   It was a hit with my client. Thanks Select for making me look great with a valued client."}
{"text":"The new owner, John is really nice. The chicken stir fry was amazing, and super variety of things to choose from... fast and friendly service.   The wifi was fast."}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot for business people and whoever works and wants to grab a quick and healthy food. This location is unique just because of it's staff. Super friendly and nice. Go and enjoy eating! Y"}
{"text":"I will never spend another dime at this establishment.  First they were cut off years ago because of customer service.  Long story short, walked in 1 minute pass breakfast and they refuse to fry an egg, after I've been their customer.   They changed owners about 4 months ago and the guy seemed nice so I thought, OK why not give them a try again.  It was going fine because he was a nice guy.  Today (Nov 14/17) I visited again and, surprised, surprise,  there was another new owner, so I proceeded to order a cheese bagel with butter. the Asian lady (Tina) re-iterated my order and I went to pay.  She came to the cash (new Owner was momentarily busy) and said my total was $3.10, I asked \"for what, a cheese bagel?' She said you wanted cheese on your bagel, I said no, just a cheese bagel with butter. she then charged me $1.95, which I thought was a bit much, but thought \"OK you dragged your ass in here so pay\"  She went back to the food station and start toasting a plain bagel, (since I was the only one waiting)  I asked who is that for? she said me, I said no, I wanted a cheese bagel, OMG, she then said that would be $3.10.of course I lost it, but paid the extra, letting them know, in not uncertain terms, that I will never set foot back into this store to spend my hard earned money   WTF $3.10 for one bagel??????!!!!!!!!!  There should be a \"zero\" star option.  Just so you know I clicked the 1 star twice trying to give a zero!!"}
{"text":"Not a selection I'd make again. Not very fresh, very pricey for what is offered. I felt I was ripped off. Got a 2 star for convenience."}
{"text":"Not feeling too hungry at the moment, I opted for soup. Today (Thurs 16th) they had the spinach cream soup on special.  I was expecting to be served up re-heated Campbells soup can but this $3.50 small bowl delivered.   It wasn't too salty, the spinach tasted real and went perfect with a pair of crackers. Nice light meal to warm up to.    My friends had gotten some panini's, I didn't try. But one comment was 'no grill marks' so that kind of was a disappointment for them."}
{"text":"They should call this place \"Select sandwich faux paus\" Sandwich done horribly wrong. This is probably the first time being adventurous has cost me. Actual dollars too! Ughh.   The place is relatively clean and can seat up to 12-15people. The menu is written in chalk on 4 medium sized chalkboards hung up behind the counter against a green and white rubics cube back splash. This gives it a very old italian cafe look. Walking in, there is a drink fridge to your immediate right, with various selection of pop drinks, Orange drinks and water (aquafina) no pop cans. Smart. On the right side the counter with all the toppings and meat are displayed. The counter stretches all the way to the end of the restaurant. The entire left side is the seating area.   The breakfast prices seem fair. Unfortunately I cannot say that for anything else. They have regular sandwich's on toast. Offering whole wheat or white bread. The panini bread is a big hunk of white garlic style bread. It's very tasty but even after prepared toasted, it does not have the infamous grill marks. :(  Although they had a few interesting selection of soups? Perhaps one day I shall try them out.. if I've tried all the places in the surrounding area.   The service staff consists of 3 Pakistani ladies, mid 50, chit chatting in native tongue while sweetly asking you what you would like,barely hearing you're actual reply. The lady had to ask me thrice what I wanted. This is even worst when there was only 1 family in the restaurant, eating at a far table. Shame.  I got a Grilled chkn Panini with cheese,tomatoe,onion,cucumber and greek sauce + ice tea = $10.48. Rip off.  The sand which isn't bad but it definitely isn't worth nearly as much. I think I'll just keep my panini cravings reserved for Pane E Vino.   Cashier lady called it chkn ceaser Panini. It seemed like they had no order system so they punch in whatever is familiar.   The only think I like abut this place is the outside patio like chair/table sets. That belongs to the property so I won't even give this place that much.   The one star is for the lady who was in fact sweet and her lack of English isn't entirely her fault.  Reading that made me realize something. I am SUCH a sucker.   xoxo M."}
{"text":"Their Jerk Chicken and Salad special on Thursdays has allowed me to improve Select's star rating. It's pretty good jerk for a sandwich shop and it actually packs some heat! Good job. $9.50 for a one-leg, (drum and thigh), meal with a generous serving of rice and a salad of choice. No drink."}
{"text":"Note: my review is specifically for catering - I've yet to actually dine in at any particular location.  If you're looking for catering downtown Toronto, Select probably gives you the best bang for your buck (by which I mean that it's probably the most reasonably priced I've encountered, albeit not the most gourmet). Plus, it's got really friendly, helpful service.  Food versus price: 4/5 Service: 5/5   I will use continue to use them as my primary choice for cheap and effective catering"}
{"text":"This is my brain: $7 for a sandwich?! I'm OUT OF HERE.   This is my brain on Select Sandwich Co:  Wow, these ingredients are pretty awesome.  But $7 for a sandwich?!  Boy, that panini is calling my name.  It's $7!!  But they use Brie and feta, of course it's a little pricey.  But it's soooo delicious.  My hubby tends to like this place more than me, but mainly that's because they only have a few vegetarian options, and because when I bite into a $7 sandwich I know I could have probably made at home, I cringe before I swallow.    The thing with Select Sandwich Co is that you can't always make these at home.  They use nice sauce and expensive ingredients and so if you're looking for a nice bite to eat with a friend on occasion, this is a pretty A-OK place to stop.   I only ate here a few times, otherwise it might warrant another star, but I tend to save the four stars for places I really, really like, and five stars for the places you should go out of your way to try."}
{"text":"Average fair. I had a salmon salad sandwich and rye salad. Tasted ok but nothing amazing. The bread was fresh. Came to $10, which is a little on the high side for this jazz-free meal. Tried their coffee, its bland. Prefer second cup right beside them.  There is nothing wrong with this place, but there is nothing exciting about it either. I'd go to druxy's or pumperknickels instead for more appetizing menu at similar pricing.  The one real concern I have with select sandwich is the amazing amount of waste they produce. Re-usable plates and mugs for dining in would be great. Get rid of the styrofoam plates and sandwich holders and just use wax paper. At the very least, have more recycling options."}
{"text":"I wonder.  Is it the pursuit of profit that leaves me receiving barely a half-teaspoon's worth of mustard, and on only one slice of bread, for my ham and swiss?  Is the bread sliced so thick that I'll fill up on pure carbohydrates and not notice the meagre amount of ham, and only one thin slice of cheese, that I'm getting for my money?  Yeah, the staff is friendly.  Whoopie.  Yeah, the fixins look great and fresh and oh so trendy.  Lovely.  But was my $8 well spent if I'm hungry again within the hour?  I expect my lunch to be a meal, not an hors d'eourve."}
{"text":"Their change back to a corporate location is very welcome, as it's now a friendlier atmosphere, having better food choices and premium entr√©es on the menu that they have to offer :) The Zesty Chicken Caesar panini with bacon and feta cheese hit the spot today, and I hope to try a lot more off of the menu, including things like Italian sausage parmigiana sandwiches, jerk chicken sandwiches and the Mac & Cheese with elbow pasta and real cheese on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Reallllllly not a fan of Select.  a.) Food definitely not super fresh. Especialllllly if you go towards the end of the day when it's been sitting out, unchilled, all day (ick) b.) Lots of the food tastes pre-made/re-heated/etc. c.) Panini's are pre-made and most of the time, even if you ask, they will not make one on the spot for you d.) Overpriced e.) Not all items on the menu are actually available on the menu (eg: cuban midnight)  Points for super friendly service, having a wheelchair accessible dining area (they have a mini elevator!), and some very delicious butter tarts. The only time I ever find myself in here is when the weather is very, very bad, and I don't want to go far from work for lunch. Luckily, that doesn't happen too often!"}
{"text":"Select sandwich is located in my office building, so it's pretty convenient if you're looking for a quick, easy lunch. I've been told that they now carry gluten free bread, but since I am so paranoid about getting sick, I'd rather avoid the possibility of cross contamination and go for a salad.  The salads are not cheap, but they do give you a variety of lettuces to choose from (spring mix, spinach, iceberg and romaine) and there are a TON of toppings to choose from. The biggest issue I found was that the amount of toppings you get (I believe it's 3/salad) is not really enough. I have concerns about meat from delis because they generally are processed with wheat so I stuck to kidney beans, chickpeas and tomatoes. The amount of beans was literally about a scoop and a half with a small plastic spoon. I requested more kidney beans and was charged an additional $0.50. I could buy a whole can for that price!  I was worried about choosing a salad dressing where I couldn't read the ingredients, and the employee hauled out the massive bottle under the counter for me to read the ingredient list - that made me pretty happy!   Overall, the salads are delicious, and in my non-gluten free days I remember their sandwiches as being pretty great too. They are expensive, but at least the food tastes good for what you're paying. I don't think I'd return unless I forgot my lunch again, but only because I don't like paying for something I can make at home for a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"Had the chicken sandwich on toasted egg bread.  Toast bread came out slightly dark. Overall a place to grab a quick bite.  Friendly proprietor."}
{"text":"There are many restaurants scattered all over Heartland.  Select sandwich is one of the original ones and I'm honestly surprised it hasn't closed down. Everyone who ate here has never returned.  My experience was definitely not the worst of what I've heard but it's safe to say I'm not coming back.  I just wanted a nice bite for lunch and I was thinking a gourmet sandwich would be great.  Sure this place serves 'things' on bread but it sure isn't gourmet or worth the $9 I paid for it.  I asked for a grilled chicken breast with roasted vegetable on a Calabrese bread. The lady behind the counter took a nice decent bun and sliced it vertically down the middle.  Puzzled, I continued to watch her put half the bun back into bag.  I asked her why she is only using half the bread and unbelievably she said the sandwich would be too big.  What ?!?  I think my shocked face made her realize that was the wrong thing to say.  She took the other half back out of the bag and made my sandwich.  She was definitely cheap and skimpy on the toppings.  I think the whole sandwich only had 2 small zucchini slices, maybe 1 and a bit red peppers, I piece of lettuce, 5 slices of olives, and a savory balsamic drizzle.    I really liked the balsamic drizzle but that was one of the worst sandwich experiences I've had in a long time.  Save yourself the trouble and spend your dollars else where."}
{"text":"This is THE WORST location ever. I placed an order on the phone the lady couldn't speak English. Then I faxed, which she couldn't read, so I emailed leaving my personal number to call back to confirm the order. The manager Andy called our company president 3 times instead of my number. On top of that the food was almost 45 mins late so all employees were left starving through a lunch meeting. Appalling service. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY."}
