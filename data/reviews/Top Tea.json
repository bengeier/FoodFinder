{"text":"168 tea shop changed its name but the menu's still the same. The regular milk tea with pearls is only $2.49. Downside is that they use wayyyy too much syrup. Also they use powder most of their drinks :("}
{"text":"Just came here one time for a grab and go.

Food: I got the green tea logan meat with tapioca bubble tea in size small. The tapioca was not a good consistency, maybe it was just a bad day for tapioca. The inside of it was hard and the outside was too soft, in general, they did not bite squishily...not sure if that made sense. The green tea logan meat flavour tasted fine.

Atmosphere & Service: There is seating available, the staff were really nice with explaining the items on their menu. The menu is clearly displayed and well organized. Service was efficient.

Pricing: My order came to be $4.19. I'm used to the tapioca being already included with the bubble tea price, but here, to add tapioca is an extra 50 cents. I personally do not think the quality is worth the price."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get my boba fix while walking back to my hotel.

Wasn't good. It tasted very artificial and the boba was overdone. It reminded me of a TapEx or a Quickly's. Bleh. But hey, it was late and they were open."}
{"text":"This place is your typical bubble tea place. Try grapefruit, taro, blueberry or mango. They have daily specials on the black board outside. They also have Korean and Japanese magazines and games to play if you sit at the back. Big props to whoever is the person who works there that watches Starcraft 2 matches on breaks."}
{"text":"Extra points for being open so late. When I need my boba fix, I need it. Tiny little place on Yonge

I didn't feel like they had an extensive milk tea flavor collection - a lot of fruit flavors. The original flavor was wayyyyyy too sweet - saccharine to the point of being gross. The boba was also smaller than usual boba, and they weren't as fun to eat because they were kind of flavorless and not very chewy.

They give out refills for half price! Tried the red bean flavor which was very strange - it was thicker than usual, and almost tasted like they had blended red bean into the drink, not in a bad way though. Tasted exactly like red bean ice cream. Interesting flavor. Once again, very very sweet but worth a try.

Bonus points for playing chinese pop music."}
{"text":"When I first moved here I was so pumped to be so close to a bubble tea place, unfortunately a few visits in, I find myself walking past.

For a place opened late, it's great to just get your tea/snack and continue your journey, but the first time I sat in there I felt as if the cashier was annoyed at me being there.

The lighting is dim, the food displays are sad and I feel like I'm just bothering them when I come in, even just to order and leave.

Definitely not a place I would bring my friends."}
{"text":"Originally opened as a 168, I was a huge fan of the place for a very long time. The original owners/operators were very friendly and always helpful. Then something happened, whether it's different owners or more mainland influence but things kind of went downhill. 

Service is quicker than some bubble tea shops (could be due to pre-prep of tapioca pearls) but there's a bit more syrup used than before so some items are very sweet. I've also found that the decor hasn't changed much and it's definitely showing its age. I can't say that the place is inviting anymore considering that many of my friends have suggested they feel either unwelcome or simply out of place here.

Might be alright if you just want to grab and go or if want a place to sit down and plan the rest of your night in the area"}
{"text":"Not the best but not horrible. Around $3 for a large original milk black tea with tapioca. Could've used more tapioca but okay for a BBT fix."}
{"text":"A very nice place to have a chat and drink some tea. The place is quiet and clean! The waitress and bartender are very nice! The food is very decicious! Well, if they can have more games that would be better!! (^_^)"}
