{"text":"The next best thing than actually having to go into Montreal for charcoal grilled souvlaki. I highly recommemd it and it tastes delish too :D"}
{"text":"Honestly not great at all - ordered the Pikilia for 1, an assorted plate of veggies, cheese, dips, and spanakopita served with a side of pita bread  Let's start with the pita bread - cold,dry and NOT cooked at all. The Dolmadas tasted like they were straight out of a can, feta was tasteless, both the Taramosalata and Tzatiki were also not made in house - store bought for sure. Tomatoes were limp and not fresh. Spanakopita was soggy as shit - not fresh or crispy at all  Don't  waste your time here - they don't know how to make Greek food unless it comes out of a container and is labelled \"Greek food\"   You can get everything I had at the IGA across the street....  Only thing that was good was their fries....which I tried off my friends platter"}
{"text":"One of my favorites restaurants when I come back to my hometown!  Everything I've had there was delicious. But what keeps me coming back is their salad dressing, believe it or not. You can ask them for a container of salad dressing to bring back home, it's a little on the expensive side but it's the best.  Their homemade fries are also delicious.  I would give 5 stars, but the decor is not the best unfortunately, it's not very inviting (especially since the renovations). The fact that's there's no dedicated area for take-out is also a bummer."}
{"text":"I know what I may write will be a sin to some. Though the gyros are great, what really makes my mouth water at this place is the Pappas poutine!! The salty chicken from the spit with there thick fries and cheese, topped with gravy! It is awesome and I recommened you to try it out!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give it a better rating, but I just can't. They wrap souvlakis like a 6 year old would. Hard to believe there's a Greekster in there. I tried sending them an email via their site, but it bounced right back. I want to like this place, I really do. I might even order again, but it's just not what it could be."}
{"text":"Like many other Greek restaurants - Pappas is bring your own wine.   Don't let the vinyl benches scare you when you walk in here. You would think that you are in a fast-food restaurant. With the high ceilings and order-by-number menu board.  Putting the decor aside, Pappas focuses on one thing - good food.  They are a great place for your Gyros or souvlaki fix on the south shore! Prices are reasonable and service is fast."}
