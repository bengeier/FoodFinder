{"text":"The food was solidly good. I had the special of fish cakes but I felt the portion was small for the price. The wait staff was very friendly. Place empty on a weekday dinner hour.  I would give 4 stars except, for my budget I did not feel the serving was up to par. It is average $18 for a burger plate. My sister ordered a fish and chips for the same price; it was very good and had a better sized-serving."}
{"text":"Just a great local restaurant Interesting menu homemade peanut brittle for an appetizer anyone?  Best fish and chips  in Toronto   Nice secluded quiet patio"}
{"text":"I booked a table for a group of 8 friends for my husbands birthday a few weeks ago.  The service was friendly and the atmosphere is nice and casual.  Reasonable prices for Toronto, although the menu is a little heavy on burgers -  more variety would be good.  I had the steak which was just ok but the mash potatoes and veggies were delicious.  Some of my friends had the turkey burger and the beef burger and they loved them.  One of my friends had the fish and chips and she said it was the best she had ever had. We will be back but I will try a burger or fish and chips next time."}
