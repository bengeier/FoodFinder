{"text":"I've been going to the Chick Pea for several years now, and it still ranks as one of the best of its kind around.    Located across the street from the Husky tower, and next to the Nexen building, it CAN get pretty busy by 12:00.  Often, the line stretches out the door.  So it's a good idea to get a head start, if you can.  However, the food preparation inside is efficient (they hustle hard when it's busy), so don't be scared away.    I'm usually a falafel guy, and $7 will get you a pretty substantial portion when loaded up.  To minimize the olfactory assault on my co-workers, I sacrifice and leave off the onions and garlic sauce, but still find it delicious as is.   It's a more flavorful mix than what I've tried elsewhere.  The donairs are $1.5 to $2 more, but they look enormous when piled high with meat.   So while the food is tasty, it's definitely satisfying in scale as well.  A nice touch is being able to grab a 3 pack of dolmades as a side to round it out.  I find the way they make 'em to be nicely balanced in flavor."}
{"text":"Best shwarma in the city, full stop. The quantity isn't copious, but it's highly satisfying. They magically combine the meat and all the veg so that you taste everything individually, but they collectively make an even better, ineffable, flavour. Get the chicken shwarma and ask for some falafel crumbled over top. Trust me.  As a largely takeout place with several tables, the decor and atmosphere in this place is non-existent, but who cares? The only real strike against this place are the hours of operation.  If you aren't downtown during the day, you'll miss out."}
{"text":"Last Friday had a beef donair from the chic and as always it tasted pretty good. What is also enjoyable is the staff are very helpful and friendly and were always looking for ways to make sure my order was made the way I wanted.  The restaurant is always clean, and I found almost anything on their menu is very tasty, enjoyable, and very affordable."}
{"text":"A long long time ago, before the dawn of time, I was a university student in Toronto. There were two places in campus where you could get a decent lunch for under $5...Wendy's (okay maybe not decent) and a falafel place. It was then that I first tried falafels and became intrigued and smitten by their flavour (and how the heck they were made).  After university, I seemed to forget about the falafel. Sure, I saw them on menus when I went for donairs but I never chose them. Maybe they were a tasty but bitter reminder of my starving student days. Maybe I just love meat more. Who knows. But today, my friends, I have rekindled my love of falafels, all because of The Chick Pea.  I decided to try The Chick Pea out after reading great reviews (and they are close to my work - bonus). I went early (11:15) to avoid the legendary line ups (it worked). Within 8 minutes, I had myself a fully loaded falafel sandwich. It was interesting to see they offered a salad version too. And $7? More than I paid in university but a fantastic deal.  I brought it back to work to eat. It was amazing. Crunchy veggies, savoury falafel balls of goodness. They were a little crumbly (as i pick out some crumbs from my keyboard) but the taste was awesome. Unlike Nick S, I don't care about my coworkers and I got onions and garlic sauce. Delicious! He's right thought...they are a bit potent.  Service was efficient and friendly. The place was clean and well maintained. Which makes me happy as nothing will stop my new love affair from continuing."}
{"text":"I was a faithful devotee of Falafel King for years but one trip to Chick Pea was all it took to convert me. If this place was connected via the +15 I would go every day. Show up early and don't expect to sit down. Absolutely fantastic shawarma meat, delicious falafel and incredible baklava sets this place head and shoulders above other Mediterranean restaurants in the core."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service. Always a treat. Chicken Shawarma is the best in town."}
{"text":"I have tried falafels all over Calgary and this place has the best, hands down. The service is fantastic, and they are very fast and efficient when it is lined up out the door."}
{"text":"My favourite lunch destination close to work and completely reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Standard fair standard fare nothing to talk about nothing to write home about there's nothing that great it's all the same for my you get everywhere else over the larger lineup.. is mostly the place for the lunch crowd to get a decent shwarma in the downtown area."}
{"text":"While this would be a fairly average schawarma/Donair place if it were located in Europe, Calgary is not Europe. This may be the best Schawarma/Donair/Gyros I've ever had outside of Europe or Israel. My Beef Donair was expertly seasoned, well roasted, and super-delicious. I'd probably eat one of these a week if I worked anywhere around here.  I also like how they put a little bit of hummus on your pita sandwich. I just wish this place was open during the late night hours - but I guess that downtown Calgary isn't exactly a late night hotspot.  Falafel was also delicious."}
{"text":"I was recently lunching it up in the downtown core, and a friend suggested we check out the Chick Pea. A fabulous little schwarma place, she claimed it was the best in Calgary. I can't QUITE agree, but it was very good. The prices are a little inflated, but the schwarmas are pretty big too.  Upon our arrival, there was a huge line out the door, but no one was sitting down inside. The curse of \"to-go\" lunch culture! It was good for us to find a table though! The line moved really quickly, and the service was very friendly and sweet. I definitely felt that my business was appreciated, even with a 20-strong line behind me.  Lots of vegetarian options for those non-meat eaters. If you're carnivorous like me, the donair is tasty and well spiced. Yum."}
{"text":"Tried this place as per a colleague who works in a nearby offices be tower. Service was good and it was a busy place but I didn't really enjoy the food. It tasted fine but there was nothing memorable. I had a chicken sandwich and I was full but I would not choose to go again on my own. I think it's popular due to the convenience of the location. I can't thing of any other redeeming qualities."}
{"text":"Caught an early lunch here. Pretty neat place and guys at the counter are helpful n patient with questions.  Got myself a Falafel Salad which for the money being charged felt a bit small in quantity to be honest. Servings of hummus was very small too. But the taste was good. I'm pretty spoilt for Mediterranean food and unfortunately I wasn't overly impressed hence the three stars rating.   I may return to try the shawarma which may change my opinion. Hopefully!"}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary by way of Houston. The office is right behind the restaurant. The decor is very sparse but the focus is on the delicious food. I really wanted to try a burger for lunch, but this place made me forget the ground beef patties. I had the beef schwarma and it was delicious! The pickled cabbage was an awesome slightly nutty sour crunch to this mound of food. I've never heard of schwarmas down in the South, but this restaurant has me on the hunt when i return!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! A family run business that CARES about the customer and delivers incredibly delicious food!!  I used to work next door and would go every other friday. Now I work from home and miss the awesome food.  It doesn't matter what the season is, there is always a lineup out the door. Yup, rain snow or sleet, the customers of the Chick Pea know it is worth the short wait in inclement weather for some wicked goodness.  I personally love the falafel. Can't get enough of theirs. And do not skip the baklava at the checkout. HUGE sheets of this honey soaked heaven await you. You won't be able to resist!! So Don't!!  Excellent value Affordable prices Exceptional service.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!"}
