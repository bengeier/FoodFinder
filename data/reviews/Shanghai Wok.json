{"text":"So I'm Shanghainese and I reminisce about Shanghainese food all the time. It wasn't until yesterday that I found out about this cosy little place and i was happy as a butterfly =). The taste brought me back to my childhood days. The owners spoke Shanhainese which helped with the authenticity."}
{"text":"A tiny family run place but good small dishes. Green onion pancake, chicken rice, braised beef with noodle are good. Soup filled dumpling was a little over steamed and was falling apart. Most of them the soup leaked out. Reasonable prices. Overall good restaurant."}
{"text":"Small restaurant but food are good. Wonton soup in casserole, Dong Bo meat in hot pot, and Chinese meat balls and vegetable in hot pot are must try. Sour and spicy soup is not that good..."}
{"text":"I forgot which of my friend recommended  to this restaurant. The restaurant is hidden quit inside of the plaza, to be serious, if I weren't dedicated to look for it, I couldn't even find it.  The decoration of the restaurant is below regular restaurant, interior or exterior.  So if you looking for a fancy place to date, you should forget about this one.  But If you looking for a traditional Shanghai Food place, you have hit the right place(that is if you don't mind the decoration and beveled tables)  Personally, I would give a 4 star for my point of view on the food & tradition dishes.  The small dumpling in pot is a must, it's a dish i order every time i go, although it's not small(in fact it's similar size to Cantonese dumpling), but the heated pot just lured my heart, and have ever since one of my favorite in this restaurant.  Price wise, overall is very cheap, I would say comparable to food court prices.  Yet they are open until very late, I recall once i walk in around 11pm ish, and they still willing to serve.    Some dishes does contain more MSG than average restaurant, so please beware.  As for Recommend Dishes, I have posted  the photos of my recommend dishes.  In conclusion, this tradition little shop deserve my occasional visits, since many dishes you cannot even find in other Shanghai restaurants, and for most dishes, the price is definitely a great bargain compare to other competitors."}
{"text":"Shanghai Wok always looks closed to me whenever I drove by before or after my yoga class.   The windows and doors looks like they are caked with oil. And indeed this is really a small, homey and rundown dirty cheap Chinese restaurant.  Food though is really good for the price and if you can overlook the sticky floors and tables?   Shanghai Wonton in Claypot ($4.99) has 12 house made wontons serving bubbling hot!   A small family business: a husband and wife team. A homey and authentic place if you want something simple."}
