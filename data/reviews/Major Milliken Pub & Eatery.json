{"text":"I was at this pub this past friday. Heard about it on reviews. Not sure how this place is still in business. It was almost empty. The service was bad, the food was even worse. Cold nachos? really? The beer was terrible, how can you screw up Canadian?!? lighting was dull...were they saving electricity?  all around bad  one and done"}
{"text":"Came here last night for a friend's birthday and I must say, the atmosphere was just very lively.  We were in the bar area, which is quite small, yet had a pretty cozy feel to it.  Because my friend comes here regularly as with the other patrons, you felt as though you were on Cheers.  Everyone literally knew everyone else's name.  Two ladies who serviced us most of the night weren't even on the clock but I guess since they've been there for so long, they're very loyal and were willing to just help out even if it didn't mean they were getting paid for it.  As badly as I did feel about the two ladies servicing us throughout the night, I was also quite grateful as the actual scheduled waitresses were not very attentive.    As for the food, I had their wings which were pretty mediocre.  They were a little bit smaller than what I'm used to getting but they were very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Because of the size of the wings, I guess the cost was reasonable.  4/5.  I had a bit of my friend's steak fries which were also alright.  Their gravy, however, did the fries justice.  I wish the gravy was actually warmer than the temperature it was served but it was still very good.  I'd rate their fries 4/5 and their gravy 5/5.  They have a really nice patio area out back which will be great for the summer months.  The people, since they're regulars, were a lot of fun and I think what also made the place even more fun is the fact that they have TouchTunes (look it up).  With this, customers were able to easily create a playlists which made the bar almost like a house party.  But man, I've never listened to so much Beach Boys in my life!   Although I'm giving the place an overall rating of 3/5 stars, I would still go back simply for the crowd."}
{"text":".First of all the food takes a very long time to come. Service is average.  Food isnt the greatest. Calamari taste like nothing without sauce . Garlic bread was so harf it cut the top of my mouth.  Wings wasnt amazing.  Place isnt too clean.  Asked for weekly special snd they didnt have ... wont come back again ..."}
{"text":"Located neat the intersection of 14th and Kennedy in Markham, this historic home turned pub is almost hidden from view from the main street so patron beware you'll need to keep your head on a swivel to spot it. Protip: If you see the signs for the Dairy Queen drive-thru follow that, it will take you to the parking lot for Major Milliken.  Entering into this historic home, there was a certain pub meets dive bar charm that I had been searching for in the GTA and consistently failing to find. The fixtures and furniture are old and worn with character, the lighting is dim, yet warm, and they have a killer patio around back just waiting for warmer weather to open. I think I've found my new spot - just wish it was closer to home for a quick stumble/cab ride.   The bar resides in one room, a dining lounge in another, kitchen in the back and the upstairs has 2 party rooms open for boozy people overflow on busy nights! It brought back fond memories of my fraternity days partying in our Frat-house.   The food was OK and really the only thing in need of a little more attention. I ordered a basic Canadian Burger with a side Caesar (my servers recommendation). My burger was overcooked, as was the peameal bacon (see the pictures) and my side salad was mostly iceberg lettuce swimming in caesar dressing. Perhaps I ordered the wrong item but my dining companion also noted her burger to be dry.   I'll certainly return to sample other menu items in future as I'm a firm believer that any kitchen can have an off day. However, as I've mentioned, this place is a great spot for drinking and a sweet hang out spot in Markham for those looking for a chill night/afternoon/evening with friends.  Major Milliken is a house party just waiting to happen - best part is, no hungover cleaning up in the morning."}
{"text":"My go to neighbourhood bar for St. Patrick's Day 2014. Me and my friends headed out here for a pint of Guinness that somehow turned into 4 pints of Guinness and sharing some bright, multicoloured nachos. This bar is located a little back from the road on Kennedy just South of 14th (in the same plaza as the Dairy Queen/Subway). It's actually in a historic building which is pretty unique for pubs in the area. So rather than the faux-aged look at many of the local pubs, Firkins, etc. you have a building that is authentically old complete with creaky stairs, tight spaces, old wood everywhere, and a great atmosphere. The food and drink is nothing that out of the ordinary for a pub unfortunately. Other than the friendly, quick service I haven't found much to recommend in terms of this. The multicoloured nachos were pretty plain and standard: lacking in some toppings (cheese) and piled heavily with others (lettuce?).  This place looks promising for those looking for an aged, worn feeling local pub hangout that's got a ton of character. The food is nothing spectacular, but the drinks are cold, the staff is friendly, and this king of place is pretty unique for the burbs."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon Coupon for this restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was. Pub food is usually just pub food. But, this was really good. My wife had the fish n chips dinner, I had the cheeseburger with fries and my daughter had honey garlic wings. We all ended up sharing. The burger was homemade. Juicy cooked to perfection. When arrived around 6pm, the place had lots of seating. We like it when it's not too loud. Probably still early for the evening customers. The waitress/bartender was very pleasant. I didn't have my phone to take pictures, but the experience was enjoyable and the food was delicious. They had lots of specials. We will be back on a Tuesday for half priced wing night. Thanks! Our second visit we had Chicken Fingers, Salmon and Chicken Wings! Delicious!"}
{"text":"As other great yelpers have said before, this bar is tucked inside a plaza by kennedy and 14th. It's right behind the DQ!   It has a neat historical exterior, but the interior reminded me of an old house in need of renovation. Beer was really cheap on Monday, they have a $5.99 domestic deal for 1.5L steins. My friends ordered the fries, but it is mediocre.   Overall, this is the place to go if you are stuck in Unionville and want to get drunk for under $10!"}
{"text":"This place has been here for a while now. I remember coming here a few times with friends a couple years ago and I had a lovely experience. However, I believe they have now changed owners and staff as I did not recognize anyone when I came here yesterday.  To be honest, after 5 minutes of sitting down, I was not 'wowed' and not happy with the service at this pub.  What bugged me:  I walked in with my boyfriend who were happily watching the blue jays game against the Yankees ( blues were kicking the Yankees ass by the way). Out of nowhere an Asian guy comes and changes the channel because him and his 'boys' want to watch the UFC fight.   I myself, has worked in a pub and restaurants before, it would be nice if they asked if it was okay. You see other guests enjoying what is on the television, why not ask or let them know you will be changing the channel and that it might be better to move to another table or seat at the bar.   That's the second thing I had an issue with. The girl who was the bartender yesterday night said i'll clean up the table for you if you want to sit there to view the jays game. uhh shouldn't you be bussing all your tables when they leave so you that you do not leave the pub looking like a mess? Perhaps I wanted to sit at the table that was dirty but didn't because you didn't clean up the tables. And the worst part, was she was making it seem like she was doing ME a favour. Honey, you're not doing me a favour, you're doing yourself, your boss and the pub.  I'm very disappointed with the service here, seems like the boss just wants to drink and get drunk with his buddies which is cool. But at least make sure service is great and that your new guests are happy.   I don't think I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's bday last week. I haven't been back since I moved to Aurora, so seeing the owner was a shock for me. The previous owner, Nick, was a genuine guy. He knew how to run the place and keep his customers satisfied. This new one, however, I'm not too fond of. I ordered chicken fingers with fries that night and I was not impressed. The chicken was way overcooked, took forever to breakdown those steel bars in my mouth. Beer was small, considering the size of cups at other bars. The only thing that was consistent was the fries. Even then, it didn't match up to my many previous visits. Portion has been reduced and price stayed the same.. I'm not exactly sure how this new owner runs this business, but if he's looking to tank he's doing a damn good job!   Management could be improved bc there was only one server seeing 30+ people and that was only upstairs. Word of advice, don't go cheap on staff.  It's unfortunate but I don't think I will be coming back. I really enjoyed this place back in the day. I have so many good memories and many good times here.  I guess its time has passed."}
{"text":"Used a groupon here, got the chicken parmigiana pasta with garlic bread, at first they forgot to give the garlic bread (new chef apparently) but waitress brought it down promptly once mentioned.  The chicken itself was quite difficult to cut and chew, a bit overcooked and doesnt seem freshly made. With cheese and tomato sauce on top, it masked and improved the flavour.  It is still a good deal with a groupon. Wouldn't come back to pay full price."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday St Patrick's day, the place as I can recall has always been a comfy, homey time of joint.  The old sofas, and wooden tables and chairs makes you feel at home.  Though the noise level was quite loud, the atmosphere was exciting.....everyone wearing green, management giving away various Guinness hats and gifts.  The food was great, I out of all days, decided to have a glass of wine, but also ordered the Major Milliken All in one combo....the portion for its price was worth it.  Ive been to this place before, it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Pretty solid food, wings are big and crispy. The sauces are ok, but it comes with a lot of veggies and dip, a plus in my books!   Burgers were huge and not too dry. Huge steak fries too.   Seems like they have a special almost every day. Yesterday was tall boys for $4.50,  but they only had Coors Lite *gags*. A little pricey..   Service was quick and friendly.  The place is pretty old and gross though.. but what can you expect from an old house. All of these pubs are pretty gross.   I'd definitely go back though."}
{"text":"Ordered through uber eats. Deluxe burger was cooked well but the untoasted bread ruined the burger. Poutine was decent, it was made with wedges instead of fries, which I liked. My wife got the chicken ciabatta sandwich, which didn't have much taste.  This place seems hit and miss, might give it another chance for their wings."}
{"text":"Entrance music was sublime, the juke box was running the tunes.   servers were friendly and accommodating and weren't too sore on the eyes.  Enjoyed a few drinks and some billiards, apparently it's free every every Wednesday.   Would definitely go back for happy hour after work again A ++"}
{"text":"Major Milliken Pub & Eatery is so hidden.. I would not say it is a hidden gem but finding it can be a little challenge.  Sharing the same driveway and parking lot as Dairy Queen.. I almost drove into the drive thru and order a Blizzard to go with a Grill burger.  Major Milliken does have a really homey feel, dark and dim with old sofas, armchairs and everything... and in fact it is inside an historical house.   Beer selections a little disappointing as usual but maybe be one of the more decent one in the area.   For lunch we ordered burgers... some home made burgers with patties grounded in house. My Peppercorn Burger ($12.99) was not bad, the patty though a little dry but it was loaded with peppercorn!! The fries are like potato wedges but of supermarket frozen quality.  Service was slow and lacking as there was only 1 waiter serving the whole restaurant. Water never get refilled and everything took forever... don't come here if you are in a rush....  Major Milliken definitely is worth the visit if you are in the area and don't feel like eat Chinese food... and even a drink? The patio looks promising, can't wait till summer!"}
{"text":"Nice quiet bar to chill with friends. The chicken wings here are awesome! Especially when it's half price wings night."}
{"text":"Updated review: still serving great wings. Patio has new tables and chairs. Summer 2016 special, 5 bottles of SOL For $25!"}
