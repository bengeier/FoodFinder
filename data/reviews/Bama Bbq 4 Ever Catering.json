{"text":"I'm no BBQ expert but if eating BBQ in St. Louis, Memphis, Texas and Nashville qualifies me as 'educated' then my opinion is worth something here.  Bama BBQ is definitely the best I have had here locally.   Everything from the brisket to pork ribs are fantastic.  My personal favorite, burnt ends,  are worth the line that forms in front of the trailer every time I see them at an event.  Need catering?  No problem, as I have had them cater everything from BBQ to a thanksgiving party and they delivered consistently good food with the sides being amazing as well.  I highly recommend the mac and cheese and baked beans.   You will want to take some home for later or at least get seconds.    So the next time you want a hassle free catering experience with a professional, punctual person in charge, then call Bama BBQ!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bama Bbq is the BEST!  Catered our son's grad party.  The brisket and pulled pork, mac and cheese, and the beans are to die for!  Highly, highly recommend!  They are my favorite here!  Thank you!!!"}

{"text":"BAMA BBQ is by far our favorite! Robert and his team make delicious everything. We have had them cater several events for us, big and small. Everything is always hot and fresh and has our guests impressed. If you haven't tried BAMA BBQ, you're missing out. Thanks for all you do for our community as well! See you at our next party."}
{"text":"Wow! We tried the ribs and brisket sandwich with sides of mac n' cheese, slaw, beans, and potato salad. SO. GOOD! The meat was tender and had that smokey flavor you look for in good BBQ. The sauce has a great tang and is the same sauce the beans are cooked in. My boyfriend, who doesn't even like beans, wouldn't stop eating them! We should have ordered an extra side! Highly recommend if you're considering this place!"}
