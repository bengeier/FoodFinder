{"text":"Classic bar and great people. Cash only. Taco night is a must."}
{"text":"If I could give this bar a zero, I would. The bartender bobby is a piece of shit. He cares more about getting himself drunk than getting one drink for a customer who is trying to bring money to the company as well as a good tip. I asked for a vodka soda and he never brought it after I waited for 20 mins and my partner drank an entire 16oz beer. You want to make better money?!?!, stop letting trash into your bar."}
{"text":"It's a quintessential 185th bar. Cash only. Earlier the better. The blue collar crowd after work are fun. The kids later at night not so much. Beers and shots kinda place."}
{"text":"wow. it's a joke, but none of the patrons are in on it. go for the half-literate bar tenders, stay for the little league baseball games being shown on multiple screens. serious."}
{"text":"If you are a musician I would stay far away from this place as the owner has ripped off musicians in the past.  Some of the bartenders are good at what they do, but some of the others are usually inebriated themselves and getting any type of service is definitely out of the question.  From what I was told they recently were busted for serving alcohol to minors!  Also, you will occasionally see people lighting-up cigarettes right at the bar.  I thought that smoking in public places was banned in the state of Ohio?   Are not both of the previously stated a smart move on their behalf!  (Being facetious here)

I will never step foot in this place again, and once again if you are a musician, beware of getting your hard-earned pay at the end of the night!

{"text":"First time patron; came for the live music (late!) on a Sunday night. Pick-up jam session featured very credible musicians who had obviously played together many times in the past.  An enjoyable, low-key vibe -- local folks, some \"regulars,\" hanging out at a comfortable neighborhood bar. Some people were dancing on the small dance floor, and my friend and I also danced a bit (badly, but nobody seemed to care or stare).

Drinks moderately priced, pours generous, and food \"hand made\" by Heather in the kitchen at the back of the bar (place your order with Heather personally at the kitchen door) was very tasty."}
{"text":"I tell you what, there isn't shi* when it comes to a good band bar in this area but Cebar's does it well.  I really enjoy it every time I come here.  Last time was with a friend and we went to see a Bruce Springsteen cover band, great time!!!  Bartenders were all over my orders (helps to be 6'1 I guess), people were of all ages, no one overly drunk, just a bunch of weekenders out to have a good time and that's exactly what I did.

I hear the food is not bad and they do run specials.  It just might be a little weird the way its laid out the nights of music to go there and eat.  I'd much rather recommend hitting Bistro 185 or Grovewood Tavern first, maybe even Beachland Bistro, then hit Cebar's on your way home.  Watch out for wild Cougars though, I hear not only do they bite at Cebar's, but they also swallow.  ;)  

Oh yeah...it might be CASH ONLY, just be prepared.....there is a PNC right next door though."}
