{"text":"I enjoy finding small independent gems whenever we go out on family vacations.  Toto's definitely is NOT one of them! The ambiance was fine.  The decor is what you would expect to find at the \"stereo-typical\" Mexican restaurant.  Aside from the fountain sodas, that's about the only semi-positive things I can say about this place. The food and service were awful.  My daughter and I got the enchiladas.  It's pretty hard to screw up an enchilada, but these were limp and bland with sauce straight from the can!  And, that was the \"highlight\" of this meal. My wife got the wings at the suggestion of the waitress.  These were literally not edible.  They had a sheen of grease coating them and were cooked to a brittle husk.  Nasty, nasty.  She took one bite that disintegrated into little pieces of browned yuckiness.  When the waitress came back to clear some plates, I handed her the plate and said that my wife did not like the wings.  Without missing a beat, the waitress scooped the plate up and headed off to the kitchen (methinks this has probably happened on more than one occasion). I never really complained as I got the impression that nothing would be done anyway.  I made sure to get a copy of the receipt, so I would remember to \"Yelp\" it as soon as I got home & maybe save someone else a miserable dining experience."}
{"text":"Back at Toto's for the 2014-15 season. Food and service again oustanding! The portions are a little smaller, which we both appreciated. We could finish our supper and not feel nauseatingly full. I had the jumbo shrimp in Sarandeado sauce, which is a specialty of theirs. They put it on several of their fish dishes including their Baja fish tacos, which are delicious. It's creamy and savory, but has a bit of a kick. I love it, but I like spicy. Definitely a place to try if you're out to visit the dam."}
{"text":"Avoid this place even if it's your only choice. The service was very poor. We were sat by a waiter who seemed annoyed at the fact he had to. We then got a different waitress who stated she was going to take care of us since the other waiter didn't feel like it. We ordered from Their lunch menu which had extremely large portions for the fajitas and burritos plates. It was impossible to even finish. The taste of the food was good, however, the smell of the restaurant detracted from the enjoyment of the food. It was hard to identify the smell but it may have been mildew. The menus thems"}
{"text":"The food is always good. When I call in a Togo order everything is just as great as when I order in, everyone is nice and helpful. I've eaten here since my mom would bring me at age 9 and some of the staff is the same and still remembers me. Definitely one of the best in Boulder city and even Henderson too."}
{"text":"Very good carne asada tacos, they are very flavorful! Good service, and decent prices. We will definately return!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food.  I know, food is like art, everyone has there own idea.  We live in San Diego, so are familiar with \"authentic\" Mexican style food, and this would make the cut in San Diego.  In BC, it is a mainstay when we visit.  Good service as well, ...all in my opinion."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Food. Server Daniel was very attentive. So try this place . You will be pleased.."}
{"text":"Great food!  Cerviche was to die for.  Small little mom and pop shop."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Ok to fill your belly but don't expect finesse in the service or be blown away by the taste. Ask them to go easy on the cheese as everything tends to have an excess amount of cheese."}
{"text":"Long time user of Yelp but first review. My brother and I stopped here on the way to the Hoover Dam. The reason im writing this review is so that others dont make the same mistake as we did. The food was very bland and uninspiring. The Tortilla soup was pretty out of a can tasting and my chile verde was no good. My brother got enchiladas (a very basic item) and was very disappointed in the blandness. Eat in Vegas or Henderson before going. Our mistake"}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant and had great service. The food was good the salsa was great, not sure why they put it in such a tiny bowl, but not a problem just asked for more, and more..the reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is that it was a little warm inside and a little pricey..I would still go back and try the flautas next time, bigger then any I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant after a long day hiking in the Lake Mead area.  One of our group members was Seventh-Day Adventist and had religious based dietary restrictions (basically, he's a vegan).  At first glance, the menu made me worry that our friend would not be able to find anything suitable to eat.  However, he asked our waiter if there were any good options on the menu for him, and our waiter very knowledgeably informed him of some ways to modify the existing dishes to suit his needs.  I was very impressed!  Plus, the food was tasty, our drinks were constantly refilled, and the chips and salsa were perfect while we waited for our entrees!  I would definitely come back and recommend it to weary hikers who need a good meal with solid service!"}
{"text":"THE END ALL OF MEXICAN FOOD!!!!!!!!  This place is just too good. Really! Before I even got to my food I was served with the best chips and salsa ever. My husband is a pro bodybuilder and is super strict with his diet, he couldn't stop lol. The chips are made fresh and the salsa...... oh the salsa. If I could just drink that stuff up i would. they should really think about bottling it and selling it.  I then got a house salad. The dressing was this great cilantro dressing that they make there, my husband got a tortilla soup. Both great but I especially liked the house dressing. When dinner came I had the pollo sarandieado or at least I think thats how its spelled lol. Chicken breast with a white spicy sauce. Im not a spicy type but the flavor was REMARKABLE! My husband got steak fajitas. I didnt try the steak but I ate all of his veggies and they were delicious, oh ya and the beans! Its hard to find a place that they dont just taste like you bought them at the store. They make them fresh here and you can taste it!!"}
{"text":"We had a group of eight. Came back from touring the dam. Great service and good food."}
{"text":"The rice was served cold. The waitress was the worst one I've ever experienced, I won't come back because of the service. I always leave tip, even if the service is not good, not this time."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the totos staff and our purchase tonight-my family in Boulder city which consists of three households have been devote patrons of totos for several years- tonight was a snaffu as far as customer service and appreciating local support. I had 3 families at my house- my daughter suggested totos as there has always been a buy one combo get one free \"combo meals \" coupon in every weekly Boulder city paper to which I had never partaken-sounded like a great idea for us tonight- e called in dinner - 6 combos - I grabbed paper and for first time coupon not there-  I had last weeks paper and yes coupon there-  I arrive to pick up our meals and gentleman at counter tells me I need three coupons and the one from last weeks paper was expired- I informed him that there was no coupon in this week which was strange and could he please honor the coupon I had for our meals-  I live here- we eat here (- we have always paid full price for everything)the first time EVER I am looking for the specials -  he denied using the coupon I had x 3 as I did not have three( BTW coupons do not state limit one per person- ). He also tried the line of \"it will come out of my pay if u don't have two more\"-  which quite frankly if he was in  India I would believe him ,- I worked and lived there and yes its not a pleasant society-  how some EVER this is the u.s. and a small town -  I do customer service everyday for a las Vegas hotel -  I listen to every excuse in the book for \" how are you going to compensate me\".   30 years customer service various fields for the record.   I greatly appreciate business -  BUT repeat customers are a blessing -  a mishap on our side over a weekly coupon should have been granted properly with a smile in lieu of harassing and arguing in front of new diners as they entered,-   I'm guessing management was off today as I cannot believe the baloney I was dished out-    moving forward we will order Roberto's or drive in to henderson - and yes as folks transiting thru ask me for a recommendation it will not be totos again -  p.s. after all the drama etc I have to add-  we were shorted on our order - nice ..............."}
{"text":"Outstanding blue agave margaritas in generous serving. The el burro burrito can feed the 5000! Vegetables were still a little crisp not over cooked and the chicken had just the right amount of flavor not to mention the guacamole and sour cream. Great meal on way back from Hoover Dam, better than any Vegas mexican."}
{"text":"Average food. The burritos seem pricey at first but they are big enough for three people. Service is decent. Restrooms are not very clean."}
{"text":"We drove from Henderson to come have Totos because we were really wanting some chips and salsa and a taco salad.  The older man that works there though has finalized our last visit.  He has served us one other time when we went and his customer service was mediocre then but his attitude tonight and lack of any decent customer service now has taken our business elsewhere.  He was very rude when we arrived, asked for our name and how many after we stood there for at least 5 minutes with out any acknowledgement even though there was no other distractions for him.  When I asked how long the wait was he gave me a very dirty look made a Huffing sound like my question was a huge ordeal and said very sharply \"I don't know the kitchen is really busy\". We work to hard for our money and would much rather spend it at local businesses that really appreciate their local customers."}
{"text":"I stopped by on my way to Hoover dam , my wife and I were very impressed with the food , the taste and quality of the food was exceptional. I did not know they make everything from scratch. They put their heart into the food, I could only wish I lived here , I would be a regular customer. The service was excellent  the waiter Giovani was very kind and helpful all the way till the end. We are very pleased with our visit there, I can only wish they would have a restaurant where I leave in CA."}
{"text":"After a full day on the lake wanted someplace to eat with no wait and good food on a Monday night. This place fit the bill. Serve complimentary chips and salsa, food comes out hot and fresh. Kids menu is more like adult portions. Place was empty and got sat right away. Server was attentive. Glad we came here."}
{"text":"Heard good review of this place so thought we would try dinner. We went on a Saturday night. We were seated immediately and were given water.  We then sat for the next 20 minutes without any service.  Can't give a review of the food as we never had the opportunity to order."}
{"text":"We actually like this restaurant and go often when in town.  The reason for a 3 is because the most recent visit we were poured the wrong drink.  We always order a shot of Don Julio.  This time they poured us a shot from the Don Julio bottle, but definitely not Julio.  Was disappointed to discover this.  We will be back, because we have enjoyed it so much in the past, but one more disguised pour will be our last."}
{"text":"Friendly professional wait staff, very attentive.  Had spinach enchiladas. Very tasty. The tortilla chips were especially tasty. It was a tough call for me to refuse a second measure."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were good. Fish tacos were pretty inedible. Fish tasted off. Enchilada on the side was gross. Son had a massive burrito which he enjoyed very much. Chile Colorado was tasty."}
{"text":"Dare I say this is an institution in Boulder City. Well when it comes to Mexican food, I say yes! The food is delicious and the service great. They always have great specials my favorite is their seafood street tacos or their chili salmon. Also would recommend the pollo sadenyaro (can't spell but it is their spicy cream sauce and it is absolutely delicious also try it on the lobster enchiladas). The salsa is of course addicting, watch out or you might get too full off of chips and salsa. I love, love, love their house salad. Check them out when visiting BC and I am confident you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"After a long day on Lake Mead, this place was great. Big portions and good food. The only issue we really had was the mixed drinks were not the best. Definitely worth coming back for the food though."}
{"text":"We had lunch here. Both of us had burritos . One beef and one  chicken . Both were good. I never eat the tortilla. Got to watch my tonage.  I just eat the inside. It has tons of chicken . Cheese  galore. Ok heat attack waiting to happen . My husband's had lots of  beef in his and  cheese  So with the chips and salsa they bring as you wait then your food I am not cooking tonight. Boxes for both of us"}
{"text":"First visit (5/2013): I read the reviews, both good and bad and decided to go to Toto's despite the couple bad comments. The food is good, the margaritas are decent, the chips and salsa  fresh. I'm from San Diego where Mexican food is abundant on almost every corner. Give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed. Make sure to ask for the hotter salsa too!  Third visit (5/17/2014): Toto's remains a decent place to eat. Fortunately we remembered this place from the last time we went and stopped by for lunch on our way to the Grand Canyon. I had a carnitas burrito which comes wet with verde (green) sauce. It was decent but I think I'll try something else next time. Don't forget to order the special hot sauce!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us once before when we were in Boulder City but we got here as they were closing. This time we were able to make it in time. The food was tasty and the service was good even if they didn't understand the oil and vinegar for the salad.  Not your typical Mexican restaurant as there were a few lobster items on the menu and multiple specials to choose from."}
{"text":"I've heard many great things about Toto's from friends/family and tried it for the first time last week...this will be very short and not so sweet.  Service was not even close to being up to par.  The \"salsa\" was bland and not very interesting.  Appetizer sampler had many over cooked items.  Wrong side on one order, missing one on another and the rest of the meals (there were four of us) were just OK.  In all fairness, maybe my expectations were too high because of all the praise from my friends and family however, I still expected MUCH better all around - particularly with the service.    As I do with any restaurant, I always give one more chance at some point so I will let you know - particularly as a new Boulder City resident."}
{"text":"Best fajitas (chicken) ever! Huge sizzling portion. Enough for two!"}
{"text":"Been here before and enjoyed the experience.   On this particular outing with a family of four, things did not go so well.  Made the trip out to the \"Mayberry of the Mojave\" to explore but thought it best to feed the bellies before our adventure.  The service was slow to sit and I thought this not a big deal.  But when when a family of four was set next to a table for four beer swigging males, my blood pressure started to rise.  The topper was an odd ammonia type smell emanating from an unknown somewhere within the structure.  I chose to ignore it but when the GF brought it to my attention, based on the totality off the situation....The decision was made to seek sustenance elsewhere.  We shall see what the future holds...."}
{"text":"This restaurant had a nice atmosphere and a very friendly waiter. The free chips and salsa were very good and packed a medium heat. The menu presented many options. However, I wasn't overly impressed with the food although the portion size was great. The fajitas lacked flavor and the larger burrito had little chicken in it. Be forewarned; the big burrito is very big. I may give it another chance and try other menu items. Pricing was companies to other Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Food was average. Awful service. Waiter never came to refill empty water. Would put food at end of the table and bang all the plates down. Didn't bring tortilla or tongs with fajitas. Had to remind him multiple times."}
{"text":"All the food, presentation... including the salsa and chips were fresh and delicious!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really liked the food here.  They have a great mix of different mexican cuisines.  The salad and/or soup that comes with your meal ate both amazing.  I had the Baja tacos and they were top die for!  Good for you boulder city!  Tasty!"}
{"text":"Great food! Fast service (for a party of 18 mind you) and an awesome post Hoover Dam lunch."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful!   Quaint little spot in a strip mall.  Giovanni our waiter was wonderful, great personality and made it all fun."}
{"text":"Excellent, unique and gourmet Mexican food. A great full bar! Memorable meal! Nice service. What a find! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome family owned restaurant.  The reviews here don't do it justice.  We want during lunch and found they had tons of options, which the chef was willing to customize for us. There were 6 of us, and we each got different items- the enchilladas, fajitas, and taco burrito were awesome!  Their salsa is great as well... can't have a good mexican restaurant without some bomb salsa!"}
{"text":"The food is good here , but I wish I took a picture of the \"house\" salad.. you might as well have handed me a head of lettuce , with my bottle of dressing. Didn't look like the other salads posted in here,  LOL! Ordered the carne asada tacos  and charro beans and rice, and the empanadas. All were really good ! Aside from my lettuce on a plate , it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Love it here great chk/seafood dishes. Soups and salads esp the dressing. Service is great been coming for over 15 yrs now"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 2 years. We've never had a problem. I bring my family out to try it and it's was absolutely the worst meal and service I've ever had at a restaurant. We ordered our drinks, and were forgotten about. We had to ask for chips and our drinks. Our drinks came as well as the chips after some time. We finally got to order our food. The food was awful. My mom sent hers back, she didn't even want to order anything else. After that we got the bill and they charges us for it. The manager came over and asked her, \"well did you eat the beans and rice?\" Are you kidding me? Your going to charge us $15 for beans and rice? So the manager took the bill back and took $10 off. He charged is $5 for the bites of rice and beans. Not only that but they added a 20% gratuity to a 5 adult meal. I am beyond embarrassed that I brought my family here. I am furious at the waitress' attitude and they way we were treated. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Food was good but had crappy service. Owner wasnt quite interested in what we had to say."}
{"text":"Great out of the way place to eat.  Service was ok and very polite.  The food is outstanding and one really does get $$ worth of food."}
{"text":"Very expensive for Mexican in a small town but steak and shrimp fajitas were good.  They do not have many vegetable choices and could improve there.   Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE FOOD!!  And I'm not an easy one to impress.  It does smell funny when you first walk in but I highly recommend the chef's specials.  The service was good for a party of 6 without reservations and everyone in our group had a enjoyable night getting together for a family birthday.  Looking forward to our next event there!!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great wait Staff all dressed in black shirts and ties. Two of our group of six said it was the best Mexican food they'd ever had. Most of us had taco salads because we didn't want to eat heavy for lunch with a pending dinner reservation at 5 on the Strip in Vegas. I'll go out of my way to go to this restaurant again next time in the area. Drinks and meals for six was $95. (They do not do the lunch menu on the weekends) Located in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Good food, with  \"Las Vegas Strip\" prices.   Be prepared for \"Sticker Shock.\"    They don't even put the prices of their beer & margeritas on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was depressing. It felt like I was in some sort of dystopian future where mexican food was expensive, wait staff were all unfriendly men, and no matter what you order you get slop. I guess it's a small town with few choices but, i'd never make this one again. I'd rather drive to vegas."}
{"text":"Not great, not terrible.  If you are in Boulder City and you want a quick bite it is OK.  The bathrooms are not nice and the menu's smelled like they could be sterilized more often!"}
{"text":"I found this little diamond in the rough.  I got the Mexican pizza with red enchilada sauce instead.  Was bomb.com.  I would come here again.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Yelp led me here as I was looking for a good sit down Mexican food place to eat. I arrive for lunch and the restaurant has only a few customers so I figure this will be a quick lunch and be in and out. It took almost 5 minutes to be seated which was my first hint of slow service. Then the greeter took drink order and 15 minutes later returned for lunch order. Chips and salsa was homemade and very good. By the time my lunch arrived 30-35 minutes later I was super hungry. I had the taco salad and it was well made and tasted authentic. My bill arrived 20 minutes later and I was shocked to see my coke alone was near $5! The lunch special was $12 which I can understand but $4-5 for a Coke?! I paid the bill and was on my way. Quality food however service and price need some tweaking."}
{"text":"Went here tonight, maybe 6 people total.ordered our food I asked for a chile Colorado burrito no beans . Low and behold what did I get a burrito with beans . Waited 5 minutes till the waitress came back asked what was wrong told her she took it away and blamed it on a new cook. She came back with my burrito that was ice cold I thought he middle with cheese inside that wasn't even melted . This place has declined since the last time we came here. We will never be back and that explain me why it was empty. Such a shame because it used to be good . Well as the saying goes all good things must come to a end and this place is done . Do not recommend at all!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by the clerk at True Value. We had just arrived from 4 months in NC and 8 days on the road. We hadn't had good Mexican food since leaving California in August 2017.   The food and flavors were excellent. The service was very attentive. I had the Chile verde. The Pork was tender and not dry and verde was perfectly spicy. My husband had his favorite Chile relleno and was not disappointed. We had a choice of beans and the rice was flavorful.  Fresh flour tortillas with the meal.   The only disappointment for me was the flan  I have made flan many times and always love the tenderness of the custard and the caramel \"sauce\". This flan was dry and they use chocolate sauce.   We ordered out on a second visit and my husband had the carnitas. Very generous portion. The meat was excellent. I ordered a Chile verde burrito and was disappointed as I had expected pork Chile verde and it was ground beef in a verde sauce. I don't remember seeing the description of the burrito and may have just ordered it without looking. I'll be more specific next time or choose something else.   Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to give this place 2 stars and almost thought about giving it 1 star based off of the horrible service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place was highly recommended to me. First off it took a while for our server to come up and it ended up not even being our server! So this young server comes back with this attitude and slams our beers down on the table! We did ask for water as well and never got it. We told him we were ready to order. We asked for salt n peppers shakers 3 times for our soup n salad. I just ate my salad, my bf waited to eat his soup cold for the pepper. Awful. This horrible server had walked by us several times, never asked if we were ok, the food is ok, but did ask my bf if he wanted another beer while my mouth was full n then walked away before I could tell him I wanted one as well. So I didn't have another one.  But the food was okay. I had the dinner special Relleno del mar and my bf had the Enchiladas del mar. The relleno was kinda bland but edible. The enchilada had great flavor, a good sauce. The cilantro rice is flavorful n the black beans were ok. The chips n salsa were good.  And then to get our check! Omg! Did he have memory problems!!!!!! He had been back around our table at least 5 more times before he realized we were still waiting on our check! Geezuz! He was lucky I tipped $7 on a 50-something dollar check! I wanted to leave $5 but my bf felt bad and we left $7. He didn't deserve that  I don't know if we will ever return but if I do I will prob get my food to go n drink my own beers at home!"}
{"text":"Two words... pollo sarandeado (although I think I spelled it incorrectly) I could literally drink that sauce.  In fact I think the next time I go I still just order sine sauce to go and put it on everything I eat. Seriously amazing. The rest of the food is good, fresh salads with amazing soft grated cheese, burritos are tasty, and the service is usually pretty spot on. sad that they eliminated their chipitle sauce from the menu because it was awesome-sauce too (sorry, I couldn't help myself)"}
{"text":"Just want to thank our server Karen for a nice lunch.  She seated us outside so we could eat with our dog.  She not only made sure to check on us several times but made sure that our dog had water.  It's servers like Karen that make restaurants great!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Can't tell you about the food because we didn't stick around. We were seated right away but then we waited and waited and nobody came by to take drink orders or give us a menu. My husband and I have a rule that if we don't get acknowledged within 10 minutes, we get up and leave. There were several waiters that walked by and didn't come to our table. After about 8 minutes, we left. I refuse to give my hard earned money to a business that ignores you or doesn't come by the table and at least say, I'll be right with you. I was kind of glad we didn't get served because the place looked dirty anyway."}
{"text":"I had a combination plate that came with a soup and salad choice. I chose salad with the house dressing, a creamy cilantro. It was light, creamy and good. The complimentary chips were warm and the salsa was fresh and tangy.  My meal was a bit disappointing. The outsides of the tamale were hard as if it had been under a warming light all day. The chicken was dry. The masa wasn't bad. The enchilada was good and the refried beans were fresh.   Want something memorable from this place get their green sauce. It is very good."}
{"text":"I've been going to Toto's since I was a kid. Best chips and salsa, the food is always spot on and the margaritas are perfect!"}
{"text":"Good service  . Not slow like I saw on other reviews.  The enchiladas  suizas  were really  good. They made some eggs for my daughter  . She liked  them. Easy parking  . Good location.  Don't be fooled by the dark door.. they are open."}
{"text":"I love this place! We're locals and have never had a problem with service as other reviewers mentioned. Wait staff has always been attentive and pleasant. Food is good and shrimp dishes are outstanding, always fresh and succulent. My only complaint is that I notice the combination dinners can be too salty. I looked at other reviews and found one that mentioned too much salt, so I don't think it's just me. Note to chefs - recipes and food are fantastic, please don't kill it with the salt!!!"}
{"text":"Finally got seated after quite a wait, was told someone would be with us shortly, I asked a short, skinny, balding man that was sweeping for some chips and salsa, he said they will be with us soon. What!!! Your sweeping!!! We are customers!! It was unbelievable! Very upsetting. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the food was not too bad. The service was horrible. A real Mexican restaurant would drop anything to get a customer chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Awesome food, as always. The service is usually good, as well, but today, not so much. My soda ran dry (and sat dry for some time) and I had to ask to get my salsa bowl refilled; and then, it still wasn't enough even though I asked for \"lots of salsa.\" My server was not as on the ball as the other servers appeared to be. Aside from that, the taco and enchilada combination is my go-to order here and was delicious, as always. Go anyway... maybe complain if your server is lax. The food is worth it.  Four stars for not-so-hot service."}
{"text":"What's up with all the haters? This place is great! I came here after visiting the Hoover Dam, so no I'm not a local. They start you off with home made chips & salsa, the horchata ( rice water) is delish. We had a party of 8 and the server did an awesome job taking care of us. From the burritos, tortilla soup, chile relleno, taquitos, and enchiladas, they were all authentic Mexican dishes. Believe me I've had my share of Mexican food in Santa Monica and LA area and this is freaking good, not to mention the price is great! We paid about $10 a person, in Cali you would pay $20 for something this authentic.  Don't let the bad reviews make you miss out on this place, also when checking reviews make sure they are current and up to date."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks to die for!! Excellent service great experience. Seafood enchiladas delish!"}
{"text":"Since Casa Flores closed an hour early we thought we'd give this place a try. We heard it's a hit or miss. Mine was a hit, chicken quesadilla, had sooooo much chicken, yum, fresh avocado. Fiance had like a monster chicken burrito, wasn't great but wasn't bad. Service was good. Awesome chips & salsa."}
{"text":"Classic American versions of Mexican food.  Better than most and no surprises.  It is located in an unassuming strip Plaza but don't let that deter you.  Service really is very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"We come here almost every week. It is a very good mexican restaurant with the best Margarita! The prices are reasonable, the service is really good!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good....the service was excellent.  And that's about where it ends.  The salsa was mostly water with a few chunks of tomato.  I asked if they had anything thicker and spicier.  The server brought something that was spicier, but very bitter.  It was certainly better than the alternative.   I ordered the verde burrito.  Shame on me for not reading the menu closely, but they put beans in with the pork.  It was off-putting but not a deal breaker.  The deal breaker was the green sauce.  Typically when ordering a \"verde\" burrito you expect a green chili sauce (something with a little heat and that green chili flavor) but this wasn't the case.  It was more of a tomatillo sauce.  No flavor at all.  It was the most bland Mexican food experience I've ever had.  To add salt to the wound...their prices are just too high for what is served.  Why can I NOT find good Mexican food outside of Phoenix?"}
{"text":"We had the best dinner here! Lobster enchiladas for me and an enormous Poblano Chile Relleno stuffed with crab, shrimp and two cheeses for my husband. Both dinners were served with cilantro rice and black beans. The food was definitely fine dining caliber in a friendly, casual atmosphere. Another plus was my margarita - similar to a Cadillac - was shaken and poured at the table, and the shaker left on the table for a second and third serving. Everything was delicious, and we will definitely return next time we're in Boulder City."}
{"text":"If you like terrible service, cheap food, and horrible conditions then this is the place for you. Bad atmosphere and they are a complete rip off. If you're in the mood for Mexican food, better look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in a nice setting. The Chile Colorado is distinctive & doesn't shy away from the heat like some Vegas Mexican joints do, & the guacamole is perfection. Good frijoles, choice of traditional or other varieties (I crave the traditional), & the rice is excellent, a point of pride for Mexican cooks I've known. Attentive service, & in cool little Boulder City - make a day of it & eat well here."}
{"text":"Generous portions, great taste. I had tocquitos, beef and chicken, with salad, rice, and refried beans. Lots of cheese, plenty of meat which is not always the case at other places."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and I enjoy there lunch specials. Nice place to go to on the way to the lake. Service is good and great chips n salsa."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way back to Las Vegas from the Grand Canyon and we were not impressed. You can tell a good Mexican restaurant by their chips and salsa and it was bland with no kick to it. The food was meh and the service was okay. Not what we expected after reading the positive reviews."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, awesome margaritas! I have been coming here for years and it never disappoints. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great service and the seafood specials are fantastic! Actually, everything I've tried there is good."}
{"text":"It was a nice little restaurant. Stopped by on our way to grand canyon and enjoyed large portions !"}
{"text":"We are from out of town. We tried this place at the recommendation of the folks on Yelp. Great choice! My wife had the enchilada soup and I had the nachos supreme. It took a little long for the nachos to come out but it was definitely worth the wait. They are fantastic! Our server is really nice and attentive. I would definitely make this a regular if I didn't live on the east coast."}
{"text":"Incredible crab and shrimp flautas! The chicken fajitas are also very good, much more than one person can eat. These are only a couple of the greats,  with so many wonderful things on the menu I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place just isn't very good. The only thing that we had and loved was the salad with the tasty cilantro lime dressing. The chorizo cheese dip was just ok. The chicken on the tacos was bland and the chicken fajitas underwhelming. The staff was friendly and the place seemed clean so those are pluses."}
{"text":"Always excellent service and great food. Portion size always need a to go container. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"There is a strange smell when you first walk in, it's one of those bathroom problem type of odors, but strangely the scent seems to come from someplace else. I hope they get that fixed, whatever it is. Way back in the late 1990s this place was AWESOME! They had this nice little side salad with a green cactus dressing and little pepino nuts that was so tasty, but not anymore. The side salad is a basic iceberg like you get at a school cafeteria. We've dined here on a few occasions and lately we come out feeling overly salty. The food is just not the way it used to be, but we keep coming back to see if we can relive the taste of the good old days. We had lunch there last month, I tried some empanadas and it really seems like it's from Costco or a frozen store brand. My wife had a burrito that was really below average. Oh well  it's probably our last time, it's just not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a tour of Hoover dam and was very pleased with the food and service. The carnitas chimi and the asadachanga were excellent! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! The salsa alone can be a meal it's so good. I had the carnitas and usually it's dry but these were moist and delicious! I thought in such a small town the food would be just ok but I would put this on my top 5 fav mexi restaurants! I'm so full right now but I can't stop!"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for a late birthday dinner. They took us in just before closing time and they were great! They could have easily gave us slop and hurried us along but we could not have had better service. Best Mexican in Boulder!"}
{"text":"THE BEST! Worth the drive to Boulder City. Great prices and excellent food and service"}
{"text":"I will give this a solid 4. Service though slow BECAUSE A SMALL TOWN RESTAURANT....was amazing. I'm not sure what the complaints are with regard to lack of flavor from salsa but ours was spectacular and we were given two options..both wonderful and fresh. The food, even hailing from southern Cali where the Mexican food is pretty great, was delicious and had original spins, as well as immaculate plating. I will return. Very pleased. Don't be surprised at first at the prices as they do seem steep. The food is fresh, relatable to all palates and is in fact...in a tourist area so they must pay rent ya'll. Keep that in mind when sampling Toto's. It's genuinely good. Straight up."}
{"text":"Came from the boat at LMBH after hours of work. We usually stop at a great burger spot. We never knew it was close by 4 o'clock. Saw Toto's and reviews were great.  I'm picky! After being seated in a comfortable booth, received drinks within minutes, ordered and received great chips and salsa with perfect margarita  and Pacifico, we received our soup and salad. Tasty!   About 5 minutes after finishing appetizers we received our beautifully displayed dinners. Tastiest part of the meal! Wish I took pics before we started to demolish these great plates. Can't wait to bring family and friends! Thanks everyone at Toto's!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!   Great food and service. Freshly made chips and salsa! The house salad dressing is a creamy cactus ranch that is just fantastic! Giant burritos covered with cheese guacamole and sour cream!  There is a great \"build your own combo\" option that let's you get just what you want, and it  comes with rice and really delicious refried beans. The decor could use a bit of sprucing up, but the great flavors of the food makes up for that!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"It's so good, I forgot to take a picture!   Given the location, I'd give it 5 stars! Compared to all Mexican food, it's 4 stars :) But for being a small place on the side of the road, it's awesome. We got tacos, enchiladas, flautas, and these yummy desserts.   The salsa is on point! If I lived near by, I'd order some for home!"}
{"text":"Was sad to give this review. Food is some of the better Mexican food I have sampled. Tried the Tres Combo, with the beef burrito, beef tamale, and Asada taco. All very good. Do not waste your money on the hand shaken margaritas! I have had margaritas from all over the US, and Mexico, and this swill was not a margarita. I even bought a shot of patron to try to salvage the drink, and it still was so bad I had to leave the drink as a loss. It would not have been to bad, but the waiter knew I was unhappy and did nothing to try to solve the issue. Never again, and that is a shame, as good Mexican food in this area is not as easy to find as you would think."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all! Service was poor the server and host seemed as if us being there was a burden. We all ordered drinks asked for waters didn't get them till the end of dinner it was my brothers birthday so we were trying to celebrate his 21st they were very annoyed that we brought a small cake. Never came back to the table to check how our food was so even though my food was horrible rice I had to spit out it was so hard I wasn't able to have it fixed or try something else we were never checked on. My cheese enchilada was cold and the beans were dry and crusty looking that I didn't dare to try it! We made reservations for 5 pm and as soon as they got 2 tables all the staff stared and pointing as if we were holding a table up! When they had tons of open tables! And only 2 servers on on a Saturday night! Drove 30 min out of the way to come here when we all would have enjoyed Roberto's or even taco bell more than dinning here! Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Ate here Wednesday in way to the dam, absolutely delicious, our part of four were stuffed, huge servings off the lunch menu, guacamole was awesome,  definitely a place to go, renee"}
{"text":"The food is great here!!!  For starters their chips and salsa, particularly the pico, is sooo good. I pigged out on them.   I got a chicken enchilada and really liked it too. Even the salad on it would good.   The only thing that I question is heir prices. I paid $4.50 for my enchilada which is fair. I wanted rice but it was $3.50. I could buy a huge bag of rice for that amount. And their flan was $5.00. That seems extreme for a cup of sugar and can of condensed milk.   Aside from that the waitress was friendly, outdoor eating arrangement was good and like I said the food was yummy!!!"}
{"text":"We are on our way to So Cal from Texas in our RV so we came here while staying down the road at the Canyon Trails RV park. The food was pretty good. It was fresh, which was nice.  The combo came with far too much food for me to finish. My husband got the spicy shrimp dish, which he liked.  It was good, but nothing special. Service was okay."}
{"text":"Food was incredible, but service a bit slow.  Highly recommend the carne asada and fajitas - beware, the portions are HUGE!!!!  You'll have plenty leftover to take home and mix in with scrambled eggs in the morning . Also, the salsa is classically delicious!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the empanadas. I had some great empanadas in Buenos Aires a few years ago and have been looking for good ones in the States. These are the best I've found so far."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Guacamole. Chips and sauce good. We try to eat vegetarian and had bean and rice burrito and tostada"}
{"text":"Absolutely great!  The service was fantastic!  Cilantro rice is fantastic!   Their special with the steak and shrimp Diablo was great!  Waiter checked in and kept us happy.  Giovanni was our waiter...great job!"}
{"text":"Best Cadillac margaritas, fajitas and friendly folks. We love this place. Ask for the extra hot salsa if you are in the mood."}
{"text":"Was expecting a little better than what we received. Slower service but luckily we were in no rush. Just like any other Mexican restaurant, nothing special."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!!!  Servings are nicely sized and the staff is friendly!  Felt like home!"}
{"text":"Margaritas aren't super strong, but they are super good and worth the price. You basically get 3 for one with the hand shaken."}
{"text":"I came here on a road trip to Las Vegas.   Toto's is a Mexican restaurant with decent food. Portions are large. I got the fish tacos (comes with two) and the portions are probably double what I've seen in other places. The restaurant interior is old school, and a little drab."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  First off, we came in at 5:30 with a party of 12.  They seated us quickly and our waiter was at our table right after with a smile on his face.  I read here on Yelp to try the creamy cilantro salad dressing and it was delicious.  We had everything from burritos to tacos to chili rellenos, it was all awesome."}
{"text":"Chips, salsa, guacamole are excellent  Cheese enchilada with red sauce is also vey good Tortilla soup was average. Tasted like veggie soup with lots of fried tortilla chips and tons of cheese  Overall good food"}
{"text":"This place is not 4 stars! Definitely 5 stars based on my experience. First we had nachos with real shredded beef and they were exceptional! Lots of beans cheese and meat-only thing was we forget to ask for jalapeño peppers but they promptly brought them to us. I had way too much food-portions are BIG! Got a combo plate and chile relleno  and everything else was fantastic. I'm picky about my Mexican food and everything tasted fresh, made in house and high quality. I wish I lived in town so I could come back often! Great experience at a locally owned gem tucked away in a quiet area but definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Really good food - the fajitas are very good. We also had the nacho's with green sauce 2 fried eggs on top and carnitas!!   Great dish!"}
{"text":"Not bad for Boulder City, though I would have expected better being west of the Mississippi. There was 2 other tables, but service was slow. Food was mediocre. Decor was nothing special."}
{"text":"I am not one for Mexican Food..but I had a hankering for it.  So I went to Toto's and ordered to go...and man I am glad I did.  The service was great!    The food, oh the food, tacos, burritos with beef, and charred beans..yeummmmm.  You get a lot for what you pay for.  The tacos and burrito filled with lots of meat, comes with soup/salad, and rice.   So delish!    I will be back fo' sho'.  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"What a find!!! An amazing little restaurant with amazing food and a lot of it!!! We had amazing signature margaritas, a fresh homemade chili relleno with a cárnitas taco. My meal came with a bowl of tortilla soup which was excellent and my husband had a cárnitas tostada,,, I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Is a drive from Detroit to Boulder City, NV too long for lunch?  I wish it wasn't.  Their \"Perfect\" magarita, complete with the shaker to top off your drink makes it totally civilized in my mind.  Our server, Giovanni, was so on top of things - but not hovering.  Food was great and the service was exceptional.  It was so good the first day, that we had dinner there the next night also.  Now that's the way to make tourists feel good about your restaurant."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place a handful of times with people who really like it. They raved about the pumpkin seeds in the salad but I do not see it myself as good. I do not enjoy this place. The service is often slow and the food is mediocre at best. Look elsewhere for decent mexican food this is just not the place."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food.  I had a burrito and it was huge and tasty.  Service was a bit slow but they were busy and if you're in Boulder city, there is no rush anyway."}
{"text":"the side salad was great and the food was flavorful and fresh, was surprised to find this good in a strip mall!  the service was slow though the restaurant was busy......maybe it was the male waiters....... yuk yuk"}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out for my birthday dinner with my Mom and Husband Joel. It was Friday night around 6:30pm. We were seated quickly, but then ignored for about 15 minutes. I was ready to get up and leave. My jacket was on and everything. The people who got seated after us at the next table over got drinks and chips and salsa and we still had nothing! The other table across from us got their order and my Mom sprang into action. She told the nice waiter (Daniel- If anyone at Toto's is reading this) that we had been waiting a long time and no one had taken our order. Instead of passing us along to someone else he immediately took our order. Way to save the night!   Now for the food. I ordered the Carne Asada Chimichanga. I also asked for a house salad with their yummy Creamy Cilantro dressing. The Chimichanga was disappointing. It did not come with rice or beans. It was just a fried tortilla with some meat and cheese. Very bland. I feel like I could have just gone to Roberto's and had better for the same price!   Joel ordered the Flautas De Toto. He loved his. That's the only reason he likes going here. They were fried perfectly, one filled with chicken and cheese and the other with beef and cheese.   My Mom decided to try something she normally doesn't get and went with the Enchiladas Suizas. She really wasn't a fan. She said they just were kinda bland as well, but the beans were good. Mom also liked the salsa.   Toto's has your normal decor of any Mexican restaurant. They have neon beer lights on some of the walls. Also, they have a bar with many margarita options too.   If Daniel had not come in and saved the night I would be giving only 1 star, but I wish there was a half star option cause i'm not fully in the a-ok range. So I say 2 1/2 stars. They need serious help in service. How hard is it to throw me down some chips and salsa. I will not be back anytime soon and for sure will not recommend them to anyone else. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is absolutely amazing and you get huge portions for a good price. I've eaten the Colorado Burrito both times - it's my favorite. The service was very professional. It's our favorite place to eat in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Stopped to grab a bite on the way back from the Hoover Dam. Had the jalapeño margarita, ceviche, chicken and steak fajitas and Beefachanga. Tore it up!!!! Some of the best Mexican food I've had. Huge portion sizes. Wish I drove through Boulder City more often..."}
{"text":"We had very poor service. All the workers looked worn out - low moral. Our server was not the sharpest knife in the drawer. Frustrating.  The food was very good once we were served. Great jalapeño margarita. Large portions. A bit pricey but not outrageous. Ok vibe.  Not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!! Service was super slow, and they were not even busy! Our server was not very friendly and did not even check if we need refills on water or salsa. I had to ask the other server for refills, to which he responded quickly and happily."}
{"text":"Great service good food.  Been eating here for years.  The owners are very nice. The staff is friendly and attentive.  The servings are large, we usually have left overs for the next meal."}
{"text":"Good food and good service!  Lauren our waitress was awesome!  Portion size was good and the taste was excellent. Highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food was great, service excellent and the house shaken margaritas were the best we've ever had! Thanks Totos!"}
{"text":"Great food great service. We had to wait a little longer than usual because they were unaware that we were coming and we were a big group, however they managed to get us served fairly quickly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have had in a long time. I drove from Surprise, AZ to this restaurant. Amazing. The food is fresh, the price is right, the size of the portions are incredible. The chips and salsa are great, diced veggies, doesn't taste sour, or too hot.  We're going to be coming back soon! Please consider opening a restaurant in Surprise AZ, we need a good Mexican Restaurant!! Love to have this quality down here! =)"}
{"text":"The service is beyond slow, as in turtles, snails and sloths. The chips & salsa were good and the ginormous fajita burrito we had was really good but could've used a bit more steak. Sometimes you luck out and other times the cook is stingy with the goods. Guess the cook was having a bad day.  If Myrtle the Turtle wasn't the name of the game they would've got 4 stars."}
{"text":"Food is amazing here! The ingredients are fresh, you have to try the guacamole, it's incredible! Service was a little slow, but maybe that means this is truly authentic Mexican food. Definitely a great place."}
{"text":"Great food and service. It's a little pricey. The tortilla soup is fabulous! We had tacos, enchilada and burrito. Big portions too."}
{"text":"It doesn't register to me how this restaurant has 4 stars. It's evident the customers don't know what authentic Mexican food taste like because this restaurant food is garbage. The rice is bland. The rest of the food isn't as great & is too over priced!"}
{"text":"The family decided to stop here for lunch after a tour of the Hoover Dam. Given that we were in the middle of nowhere, we were very surprised at how good the food, service and cocktails were.  The have a fantastic selection of margarita's from the standard to top shelf.  My wife went with the good o'le margarita on the rocks, while I ordered one of the top shelf selections -- we were both very impressed.  The food (we ordered way too much) was fantastic -- green chili is a winner. I look forward to going there if we ever pass that way again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. Everything was made from scratch and it was excellent food. We had chicken nachos, the combination burrito and the porkachanga!! We'd recommend it."}
{"text":"We went in with pretty low expectations and were pleasantly surprised!  We had a late lunch - there was only 1 other table sat when we got in. Our server was fast and very friendly and our food was delicious. My hubby had a margarita, which he enjoyed and I had a michelada, which was really good.  I had one of the combo plates, with a cheese enchilada and a chile relleno. Everything was good and I have no complaints. The only negative I would mention is that their salsa was only OK. I take my chips and salsa seriously, and was a bit disappointed there.....next time I will ask if they have something with a little more kick to it.  We'll definitely be back! We enjoy taking drives and exploring the valley and Toto's is worth the trip out to BC!"}
{"text":"Visited with five people on a Sunday night at about 7:30, the restaurant was pretty empty.  We boated all day and were hungry!  We sat down and waited, and waited...and waited.  We asked one of the waiters for chips and salsa and were told that our server would bring them.  She did bring them but disappeared before we could give her our order.  So finally the food came but we were all half asleep.  It was okay, average Mexican food - not the best, not the worst.  Good and fresh chips and salsa and margaritas.  The wait staff just seemed so un-interested.  I guess I will try a new place next trip."}
{"text":"Great little family owned Mexican restaurant everything was wonderful portions huge, great food, service fantastic, this is one of those places that if you didn't know it was there you'd never find it so when you go to the Hoover Damn stop by take a load off and get some great grub and drinks."}
{"text":"Was ok. Something to eat when u are hungry.   We stopped here after the Hoover dam visit. Bolder being the closest town for anything near Hoover dam. This place was deserted when we entered.   Food- below average. Chips and salsa was the best among the food we had here. We ordered chimichanga (salty and goovy), veggie griddle( super salty) and majority was cabbage.   Kids quesadilla was tough.  It was little too price for the quality.   The staff, at least our server was nice to us."}
{"text":"Food was eh, ok.   Service was good. Our waitress was Suzy. She was friendly and efficient, but the place was empty.  I guess for locals it's a good little go-to because there doesn't seem to be a whole lot in this town. By the time we left, the place was over half full."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The quesadilla and the tacos were both some of the best I've had. The house salad dressing and house salsa were also great. Good service, good music, great food. I'll be coming back next time I'm in town"}
