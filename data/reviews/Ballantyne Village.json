{"text":"Great place!  Ballantyne village has a little bit of everything!  Great spot for our residents!  Location is in walking distance!"}
{"text":"Terrible parking.  Why would the owners buy a shopping center without the parking to go with it?  They are hurting the business owners in the center and the neighbors that would like to go there.... pitiful."}
{"text":"Great selections of businesses, restaurants and bars in this \"village\" in Ballantyne. Located off 521 & John Delaney, you find anything from chain restaurants to local eats. It has it all. A YMCA too. The center of the village has great summer bands that can be seen at Mix at Six on Wednesday nights. Went there for one last week and was impressed with the size of the crowd post 7pm. Some great shops and boutiques located there as well."}
{"text":"Parking sucks now that the owner of the deck has closed off the deck & additional parking spaces.  No bueno!!!   I used to love running over there for lunch, or stopping in at Rush Espresso for a coffee, and going after work to the Ballantyne Village YMCA, but now I dread going any time of the day because of the #$@Y parking situation.   Right now a lot of the retail space on the bottom floor is vacant, so I really hate to see what the parking nightmare will look like if more shops start opening up.  The new owners and the previous owners really need to sit down at the negotiating table and get the dispute over the parking deck settled ASAP!!"}
{"text":"While it's a \"sleepy Sunday\", several shops / businesses were closed, I'll definitely have to come back on a Saturday or during the week to shop. This particular Sunday brought me to Terrace Cafe for brunch with the lovely ladies Dion L. & Rachel N.   A glance around the \"village\", I really like that there are several shops, resturaunts, a YMCA, & a theatre. Clearly, I've seen check-ins & reviews @ several of these establishments, so it was nice to put names with physical places."}
{"text":"I love Ballantyne Village. We used to live out that way and we'd frequent several of our favorite shops....or shoppes. Plenty to offer on the dining/entertainment/lounge-y scene. Some favorites are:   Ballantyne 5 Theatre Extreme Pita Jade Asian Fusion Terrace Cafe Occasionally Mellow Mushroom D'Vine Wine  RIP to Jesse Brown's Outdoors that used to be open. Loved that place."}
{"text":"Great shopping center, I love living so close to here!"}
{"text":"Nice shopping center in the Ballantyne area with lots of shops and eateries to browse.  It was quite busy on a Monday so I imagine the weekends are as well.  The parking and traffic flow seems a little strange for the area.......a little congested I guess, a more open plan seems to be a better fit for the area.  I'm looking forward to return to more of the restaurants and Kilwin's!"}
{"text":"The owner of the parking lot has the misery just right at Ballantyne Village.  I feel so sorry for the amazing shops at the Village. The owner has blocked one parking lot and most of the garage spots trying to encourage you to valet. The result is everyone trolls the  lots for spaces getting overly agressive. It makes it do dangerous to walk the area. I think about it every time I come here. It puts a damper on an otherwise awesome  experience."}
{"text":"I'm a fan only because of the Theather and The Blue Taj - Though Terrace Cafe is there now so that should be a good addition!  For some reason it seems to me, the Village itself lacks some Romantic element."}
{"text":"Things are up & coming for Ballantyne Village!!  They have plenty of parking in the deck just drive up or down. They have elevators!!  New 3H market on Tuesdays 12-6 & Saturdays 8-4. Check it out!!  More new fun things coming!!  Don't be left out!!"}
{"text":"It was great until they put this HUGE annoying billboard up! You can't sit outside and eat because you have this big screen in your face !!! It isn't relaxing atmosphere at all!!! Take it down !!!"}
{"text":"Clean and upscale movie experience.  Alcohol is available for those wanting to indulge.   I wish they had leather seats that fully recline, like their competition at Stonecrest, but their seating is still comfortable.  This theatre is always less crowded than many others in the Charlotte area.  With all the restaurant options in Ballantyne Village, it is possible to make an entire afternoon or evening of dinner and movie.  So happy Ballantyne Village has come of age!  Go. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The 2 stars are only for Rush Espresso and Blue Taj.  For such a nice looking center it has a lot of vacant stores.  That plus the mess that is parking makes it easier to just write off the whole center and avoid it.  This is a case of selfishness and mismanagement by current and former owners.    I feel very sorry for the quality small businesses in this shopping center."}
{"text":"As with many things, there is more than one way to look at this village.  On its surface, the place itself is quite decent: An upscale strip mall is perhaps the best way to describe it (don't tell any Ballantyne folk that, they might run screaming in terror). A nice selection of places to visit - a theater on the upper level. The Blue Taj. A few others that tend to come and go now and again, so I won't go into them, as you get the idea - it's a shopping center, after all.  What makes this place interesting is that much of the parking here is actually not owned by the same people that own the center itself: It's apparently owned by the guy who built the center, and since he is no longer making any money from that, he has blocked off the parking garage. Understandable, really - why should he allow folks to park there when he isn't getting any money from it? I don't mean to be daft, but it does make sense, in a roundabout sort of way.  Unfortunately, it means that it makes the village itself a bit of a pain to use, especially if you're there in a time crunch, like while eating lunch. Apparently some of the tenants - like Blue Taj - have reported that said business has dropped off by as much as half for this very reason.  So if you  have time to park elsewhere and walk, or if you live nearby, then by all means, give them a visit. Otherwise you might not have a great time."}
{"text":"Good shopping center. Lots of options for food. There is also a movie theatre as well as an assortment of businesses. I've never had an issue with parking. The parking deck is not far at all and there is an area where they do valet."}
{"text":"I really love this complex. It offers so many great local businesses in one spot. With the parking garage, there is ample space. As a bonus, parking is free! The area is clean, new, and trendy. Ballantyne Village takes great care of its grounds and buildings. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Tight shopping plaza with not much parking but they do have a complimentary valet available. Upscale shopping and they have a coffee place - Rush Espresso - that isn't the green siren lady. Let them have your car if you don't find a space the first pass. It's not worth the hassle of circling around!"}
