{"text":"I went here with high expectations as it had been suggested many times. First I wanted to get a wrap, and you can get salad instead of their chips. But they were unwilling make it a side Caesar salad, only \"their\" salad. I even asked to be upcharged (it's really just the difference in lettuce and dressing, not like I wanted a filet across it or anything, just a small side Caesar). Ok no dice, so I ordered the Caesar wrap. After waiting a few minutes im told \"we dont have Caesar dressing.\"  Ok, I'll get the turkey avocado wrap (which cost less but I didn't say anything about it since I'd already paid and tipped, and it wasn't that big of a difference). 

I take it home and first, there was an extremely disproportionate amount of avocado to the paltry amount of turkey. Then in the first half of the wrap
I hit two bones, one which left a small crack in one of my teeth. When I called up first they just said \"well tell us next time you're here and we'll do something\" (one assuming I'll be back, and two very vague on what they'll do).  I ultimately called right back and took the remaining food and one of the large bones back (I had spit the other one in the trash).

If I could give 0 stars I would, or less."}
{"text":"I just tried this amazing place last night with my boyfriend! I got the chicken & avocado wrap with a side of sweet potato fries! It was super yummy and the lady that helped me out was very kind and patient. I would definitely recommend Daily Kitchen if you're trying to be healthy and get something fast!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken tacos and sweet potato fries. Bomb. And they had this lemonade with vanilla and rosemary- even more bomb!!! Place was very clean and super inviting, definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and food was delicious. I had the angus grass fed burger with a side of kale salad. I want to work my way through the entire menu eventually."}
{"text":"This place was better than advertised.  I had the Ahi Tuna Tacos which were a bargain at $14 and they were amazing.  Delicious Creamy Ponzu Sauce and the avocado was nice and fresh.  My friend had a market Salad for $9 where she was able to pick from 3 different salads that all looked delicious and freshly prepared.   I had a Waiakea water which is a cool new option of water that I had never seen before and she had House Made Rosemary Vanilla Lemonade.  Alondra was super nice behind the counter and she was helpful since this was our first visit.  I am already looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this place. We order lunch everyday and we decided to order from them today. Southwestern Chicken Salad had huge bones and no dressing at all. Black Bean Burger was dry and didn't have a side dish. Almond butter and jelly sandwich was dry and hard, sweet potato fries were totally burnt. Called them to let them know we had these issues and also took pics to show them. We were told we would get a full refund back, went there and out of $45 they gave us $21. Staff is rude and our company will never order from them again!!! $"}
{"text":"Great selection of food! Fresh and healthy ingredients.. This place would have a higher rating if the cashier didn't have a \"hatchet man\" necklace clearly hanging out of his shirt!! (hatchet man is a symbol for Insane Clown Posse which has a strong gang following as \"Juggalos\".)

Seemed like a great place was some good options!! I think the owners should just be aware of what their employees are wearing and that it could be giving off a bad signal and conflict with the image and lifestyle they are trying to promote."}
{"text":"Currently under remodelation, has been for awhile :/ food is great and tasty and love the layout. The cashiers could be a bit more friendly and at least smile not be too serious. Def a recommended place for healthy foods, and their pico with chips is BOMB.com"}
{"text":"The acai bowls are great,  the breakfast was great I ordered the eggs w turkey sausage,  organic coffee I  loved..  The service sadly isn't good.  The cashiers were rude no smile and I did spill water at table went to notify them and the cook looked at me made a face and a rude noise along with it.  I apologized but it wasn't enough,  I needed a spoon and the server forgot to bring it to me,  by that point I was annoyed that I used my daughters baby spoon finished my food and left.  This was my second time here because I went first time and service wasn't good; but food was great so I was hoping they were just having a bad day... My second time the service was the same.  Even my 16 year old daughter said they are just rude here,  I say let's not come back...  So unfortunately we will not be.  I did give them 3 stars due to liking food but when service isn't good it just makes you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Daily kitchen is amazing!! Highly recommend. Great staff. Healthy food. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"SLOWEST service and we were the only two people in the place. I had the Farmers Scramble and it was too watery."}
{"text":"I had the black bean burger and sweet potato fries and rosemary vanilla lemonade.  All of these things were super delicious.  The lemonade is so tasty!  My only but is that the price is a bit much.  Almost $14 for lunch."}
{"text":"Love love love!!! It was very busy when I dined in, but had excellent service. There were only 2 people working, a young Hispanic lady and a young man. Can't remember the names but I know they handled the rush very well. Not sure why only 2 people would work during such a busy time but it was handled extremely well! Awesome service! Will definitely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy the fresh juice but we weren't too impressed with the oatmeal and salad we had. I will definitely be back for the juice and to try some of their other food options."}
{"text":"I try to be very very aware when it comes to what I eat and the quality of the ingredients in my meals; this is why I LOVE DAILY KITCHEN. Daily Kitchen goes ABOVE AND BEYOND to provide quality ingredients that allow you to be confident that there are no GMO's, chemicals, antibiotics, etc. in your meals. They are transparent about where all of their food is grown and sourced, as well as the treatment of the animals used to supply their meat. Quality, sustainable, honest practices coupled with clean, healthy, DELICIOUS food= my absolute favorite restaurant. Daily Kitchen, you guys are amazing! I dine there at least twice a week!"}
{"text":"I really do love the food, the market salad, the smoothies-all great, but they are so under staffed! 20 minutes waiting for two smoothies (?!) Another time I was about to order in line and the worker had to take a call (pick up order) waited for 5 minutes just standing there, awkwardly, then left because I did not receive help. I know 5 minutes does not seem like a long time, but when you know they are already slow at putting your food together, waiting to place it adds to the amount of time I spend there. I tried to place a pick up order again today and was on hold for 7 minutes! By minute 8 I hung up. They have lost my business twice because of how slow they are. I really hope they hire more on or figure out a system that accommodates their guests because it has forced us to eat elsewhere! :("}
{"text":"We loved our meal. I stopped by after grocery shopping at TJ's and picked up the Korean tacos, soba noodles w/chicken, a mixed salad and kids quesadilla to go. My family including children all loved it. All the food was delicious. It is nice to have a healthier option for the nights when preparing food at home just isn't going to happen. I would compare their food to Rachel's Kitchen and Lyfe Kitchen. But they have their own unique menu items and we will be back."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try this place today . Omg it was so good .. I had the ahi tacos and the Rosemary lemonade .. I can't wait to go back tomarrow .. So much flavor and super healthy .and the staff was super helpful ..."}
{"text":"If you would like something that's fresh, raw, and satisfying to the soul! Then give this place a shot, it's not your normal fast food joint! The service is great and their smoothies are vitalizing! If you are a true raw food eater and don't want any toxins in you body, give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Great place with healthy choices. The customer service is absolutely amazing, great staff and perfect service. 

I always get the markets salads and they never disappoint. Also the vegan cookies are magical, but a little too pricy! They are $4 for a bag of 4 cookies the size of a silver dollar."}
{"text":"I had never been here before.  Had a very limited time to have lunch, the staff was so nice and helpful. Suggesting a salad, or one of the braises.  I had the Korean Braise with brown rice, with my to-go, in less than 10min! Perfect. When I got back to work and tried it, It was so tasty! I will definitely return and I've already started asking if anyone else I know have been, because they need to get there stat!"}
{"text":"So I waited to eat there a few times before I write a review. Not everything has been on point but what stands out above everything else is management listens to feedback and has already made adjustments. My wife is the vegetarian going on vegan and I am the meat eater in the family, and we both have been satisfied in the choices. We were told of future changes and am looking forward to being part of the \"experment\"."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place because it reminded me of a chain in California called Lemonade. 

First impression: before entering I saw two women leaving (empty handed) complaining about \"if we ask for something fresh then you should offer something fresh\". After hearing them I decided to still continue forward. It's about 5:30pm on a Tuesday which is basically dinner time. I walk in and there are only two other parties there eating. 

I check out the food bar and indeed the ladies were right. Nothing that was displayed looked fresh at all and there was very little left of each item. It was kind of ironic because I thought it was dinner time so they would have a full fresh display. Not only that, all the pictures around the walls say \"fresh\". 

What I ended up ordering was off the main menu (instead of the cafeteria style displayed items). I ordered the soba salad and it was okay. Pretty bland but none the less healthy. 

I wanted to post my review because i really want this place to correct the issues. It has great potential with them being located behind a hospital and in a decent area. 

I wish they would work on their execution. The place is really clean and the employees were nice to us. But I just think it definitely needs work with the \"fresh\" part of their food. Especially the ones that were displayed."}
{"text":"I must eat Gluten free.  I was so sick of eating cardboard, that I was contemplating a hunger strike...then I found Daily Kitchen.  Very clean for Gluten free folks, extremely delicious for everyone.  I eat there four time per week, never disappointed.  I've catered a lunch for 35 with them as well, food was fabulous, service with Dominic was exceptional.  Their Israeli couscous with truffle oil is phenomenal. Guacamole is the best I have ever had (I just drooled on my keyboard).  I'm eating there tonight, Turkey Chili sounds good.  Highly recommended (if case you didn't catch that already)."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now. Their breakfast is really good, and I love their chicken tinga. However, the service could be better. Their take out system is horrible. All of the times I've ordered take out, I've had to wait in line to pick up my order. What is the point of take out if you still have to wait? Also all of these times they seem to mess up my order. They somehow forget to include your whole order. So if you are doing take out, definitely check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"An O.K. experience. Customer service was great. Restaurant environment is clean and enjoyable. 
The range of the menu seems to focus more on people who have a fixation on grass-fed beef and poultry. For a restaurant that offers a variety of Kombucha flavors as drink options, I'd like to think they'd have more vegetarian entrees. Those who eat meat-less will find themselves drawn toward the salad dishes, which are tasty but not anything better than what you'd find at a Whole Foods salad bar... and not exactly exciting either."}
{"text":"First time at Daily Kitchen. Brought my son and grandkids (not typically healthy eaters). The kids meals are a TERRIFIC deal, and yummy. Son ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos, and he said they were very good. I had the Southwest Chicken Bowl -- great taste, but way too much food for me :) The only reasons it isn't 5 stars are (1) that it took a little longer than I would expect given there was no one else ordering. There were two employees and a manager, but only one of them prepped the 4 meals -- would recommend the manager or cashier jump in to help expedite if there are more than 2 meals being prepared. Also (2), in reading other reviews I just found out there is a loyalty program. No mention made -- which would have been nice for my $58 order. I'll definitely be back -- need to try the Ahi tacos for myself, the Acai Bowls some morning, and I bet the market salad for lunch would be great. Bring a Daily Kitchen to Southern Highlands please! (PS, all employees and manager were very friendly.)"}
{"text":"If it was just based on taste I would give this place five stars, everyting I've tried has been really good. Sadly, they are way too expensive for their tiny portions, I spent 50 bucks for just two people the other day! Also I've ordered their dragon bowl and acai bowl both to go and they gave me only about an inch layer of fruit/toppings with the rest being liquid acai, a huge ripoff for 9/10 bucks!"}
{"text":"So far the juices, food and service have been wonderful. Prices are also very reasonable. I wish they would specify what was organic vs. not, however that won't stop me from coming. Also the music in the place is usually a bit much for me (natural foods with synthetic music), but it is like that in so many places now. It's just nice to have more options for healthy foods. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here because the atmosphere seemed lively, and the food looked so delicious and healthy! So I went and.....not exactly what I'd had in mind.

First off, customer service!! Right off the bat, I could tell that our waitress did not seem interested in her job, and she seemed confused with the way we customized our order (because we like to mix things up a bit to make it interesting). She kept entering in our order wrong, and it took her a good 5-7 minutes just to enter in a default item off the menu along with a protein bowl and a few additional items.

Second, the atmosphere was nice, and the decor was clean, but it really didn't scream \"HAPPY\" as much as I would have liked it to. I mean, if you're trying to send a a message of healthy/clean eating, I would recommend a well-rounded, prepared staff. 

Third, the most important part, the food. I ordered a protein bowl with grilled salmon, brown rice, and sweet potatoes. Simple, but delicious, right? When my meal was served to me, it didn't have the best presentation, and as I ate through my salmon, it was raw at the bottom, which isn't harmful, but I personally don't like raw fish, so that completely unflattered me. But I do have to give props to the sweet potatoes. They were seasoned perfectly and delicious. 

Overall, I would say that I probably wouldn't come back to Daily Kitchen, mainly because of the staff. However, if the staff decides to improve or become more prepared for their customers, I might consider coming back."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for the place but ended up crashing and burning. Took forever to get our DK grass fed burgers and once served the burger had no flavor at all along with a super weird bun that is hard and excessive bun. Meat was dry as well. We felt completely un full from the meal and still hungry like we had not even ate, stomachs still growling for food. Save yourself some time,money and don't bother coming here"}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. The first time I went all was well. Our food was good and I got the southwestern chicken bowl and didn't have any complaints. The second time I went I got the same thing because it was good the first time around. The first thing I noticed was that it was missing the delicious lime dressing. But the worst was finding not 1, not 2, not 3...SIX large chicken bones in my chicken that I could have choked on. After the first 3 I took them up to the manager. She proceeded to tell me that they braise and pull apart their chicken in house and that there's always a \"small\" chance bones  could be in there. No apology, no offer to make me a new meal, no offer to return my money. All she did was dispose of the bones for me. So I guess on the menu it should also say \"SMALL CHANCE OF CHOKING ON ANIMAL BONES\". She came around later to pick up our plates and asked how our food was. My friend said hers was good but mine was not. The manager then looked at me and said \"yeah well her and I already talked\" and walked away. If I had choked on these chicken bones (some were more than a couple inches long and had sharp edges), the restaurant would have been at fault. And if they really cared about food quality and not getting sued, they would make sure there wasn't a \"small chance\" that bones could be in their food. I will never go back to this place and will continue to spread the word about the poor quality food, awful and staff and even worse manager. What a disappointment. Don't eat here unless you like bones in your meals!!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and healthy. Great blend of flavors that leaves you feeling satisfied. Who ever  prepared the menu knows what they're doing. I'd definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Finally tried Daily Kitchen after everyone was telling me how delicious it was. And I must admit, I wasn't impressed.

Korean Street Tacos- they were ok. Not anything special.  Not too much flavor and the tortillas were soggy. Chips were stale. 

Turkey and avocado wrap- it was good but the turkey was kind of dry. The cilantro mayo was good. 

Kids quesadilla- it was over cooked. Weird. The tortilla was like a chip. Fries were soggy. The Vegan cookie was amazing though.

I would only go back for the cookies. Lyfe kitchen is so much better."}
{"text":"we went to daily kitchen for the first time, ordered the southwest chicken bowl and the spicy chicken Thai wrap. they were both incredible. the service was amazing, everyone was super friendly and welcoming, and the restaurant was very clean. 

we will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast , I had the Turkey wrap minus the turkey extra tomato on a tomato/basil totilla.
AMAZING. .
The homemade chip amd salsa where AMAZING , as was the berry smoothie ..

Hubby had the Burger and Sweet potato fries.
He said it was good and doesn't usually eat sweet potato fries but said thet were awesome ..


I cannot wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the black bean burger on a spinach wrap with alfalfa sprouts. It came with sweet potato fries and I got a lemonade. Everything was amazing! I will be coming back and bringing friends/family with me!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon, good food, very clean and nice. No complaints. Food was tasty, smoothie was good."}
{"text":"I've tried this place several times and each time I'm very disappointed. Overpriced food that is under cooked and overdressed. When you order a dish with salmon and quinoa and vegetables they bring you your salmon in a cup which I think is ridiculous. Staff is careless doesn't pay attention. This place needs a lot of help!!! If I were you I wouldn't even bother going."}
{"text":"closest place to my work where i can get my acai/pitaya bowls! love the dragon bowl, they will add chocolate chips if needed! i need my chocolate chips! lol :)"}
{"text":"Upon arrival you are greeted with a clean and organized dining room.  Then you are welcomed by Isaac with a great smile. (Could lose the gum though)

We got:
Ahi Tuna Tacos - great flavor, awesome
Grass-fed Brisket Tacos - perfect  spice and flavor
SW Chicken Bowl - big dish big flavor
Chicken Caesar Wrap - don't get this if you're not hungry,  big portion, great flavor
Choco-Banana Power - delish
Berry Berry Smoothie - delish
Sweet Potato Fries - baby loved them (so did i)

Overall great experience,  we will be back!"}
{"text":"I had brunch with my brother here the other day and the owner of the place actually helped us out. She was so helpful and patient with us when choosing our food, once we got it she made sure we liked what we ordered which of course we did! I had the spicy Thai chicken wrap with a spinach tortilla and it was sooo flavorful and good! It came with tortilla chips on the side which looked like they're seasoned with something. It also came with a side of pico de gallo and I was very surprised and impressed with how good the pico de gallo tasted. Also grabbed a green paradise smoothie which consists of spinach, almond milk, shredded coconut, and banana. Everything tasted fresh."}
{"text":"First time here, I eat really healthy so me and my husband came in to get something quick. The food was amazing and the Gentleman was very sweet and personable! Will definitely be back! Thanks for a great service!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out last week for lunch. I did not go inside the place, the food was picked up by a colleague. 

I ordered the turkey avocado wrap, with the quinoa salad. The wrap was huge! It was a lot more than I expected. The turkey meat was real turkey, not like cold cuts-it was the real deal! The wrap was so yummy!! The sauce was tangy and good and there was plenty of avocado on it! The quinoa salad was bland and kind of mushy, I had a few bites and didn't finish it, which is the primary reason for the 3 stars. 

I'd like to give this place 4 stars, but want to try another item or 2 before I increase the rating."}
{"text":"I Loved this place. The food was tasty and left e satisfied without feeling like I ate out at a fast food place. It was healthy an geared towards those who don't want the typical crap in there food. The service was nice they were pleasant, smiling and helpful. It was my first time but it wont be my last."}
{"text":"I got the soba bowl and detox juice which were both delicious and light. However, when asked what protein I wanted to add to the bowl, I was offered tofu as an option. I selected tofu and halfway through eating, I realized they had given me chicken. When I asked for them to change it, they responded that they did not have tofu. I would have appreciated being told that while I was ordering. Although I am not vegan nor vegetarian, I would have been extremely offended to find meat in my food if I were vegan. Other than that, food and service were excellent. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars based on service. I have been here 3 times and each time I was hoping for better service and was let down. The first 2 times I placed an order online for lunch and both times when I came in at the pick up order time I was told \"oh we just got your order\".   So I had to wait about 25mins for my food that I shoulda had when I walked in. Not cool. The second time this happened at least the manager was nice enough to take care of the bill. Yesterday I went in and ordered a 16oz smoothie. That's it-easy enough, right?  15mins later I had my smoothie. Yup-15mins for a smoothie. Not cool. This place needs to hire some extra help or something because the wait for food is ridiculous"}
{"text":"Very good food. Very good service. Nice and different then usual lunch. Great quick breakfast lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Definitely not my usual kind of place, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good the soba noodle salad was.  Lots of healthy choices that are delicious.  It's a really great option for the days you feel like a healthy option and you don't want to cook at home."}
{"text":"It was lunchtime with a friend.  We decided to try out DK for a healthy change. They offer many organic choices as well as vegan.  It's located just off of Eastern so it's very easy to see from the road.  The dining area is kept very clean.  

I decided to try the Spicy Thai Chicken Wrap which contains organic chicken, pea sprouts, cabbage, carrot and spicy peanut sauce.  The peanut sauce gave the wrap a great flavor. It wasn't a huge wrap but just enough to fulfill my appetite.  I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries which were delicious.  I always love them.  

Daily Kitchen is not too shabby. I want to come back for their breakfast someday.  Thanks for a good lunch!"}
{"text":"I've now been a regular customer here for a few months and it never disappoints. I have read some of the lower rated reviews and I can't relate as I have never had a bad experience here. 

There were definitely a few kinks when they first opened but that is completely normal in any new establishment. The staff is always very friendly, the food is clean and well described. 

I noticed that they just added a MARKET COUNTER sign which I think will help drive customers in that direction. I now usually order from the counter as the salads are really fresh, vibrant and delicious!"}
{"text":"Hooray for having Pitaya bowls! First place I know in Henderson that has dragonfruit on the menu. Yum! Love the Dragon Bowl that had pineapple, apple juice and Pitaya/dragonfruit blended and mixed in with mixed berries. Definitely superfruit status. It's topped with shredded coconut and granola too. My bowl of fresh fruit was served well chilled and the portion and price was just right for me.  

What I wasnt too crazy about; the street tacos. Nice pairing of the Korean chili paste, salsa, sprouts and beef. The thing was there was more salsa in mine than beef. The tortilla chips it came with were gawd awful. Tasteless and texture of cardboard. #sorrynotsorry  Possibly stale? Those chips ended up being the running joke between me and my bff for the day.   It's an okay dish..but at $10 is not worth it IMO.. so pass. 

The kids meals at $5 are a steal. Good variety to choose from. Almond Butter/Jelly sandwich, Organic grilled chicken. It's nice they introduce healthier choice dessert (vegan chocolate chip cookie) The toddler we tried to feed it to wasnt having it though. Took a bite and the \"eww\" expression on her face said it all. Nice try Auntie.  FTR I took a bite and I didn't care for it either.

The lemonade infused with rosemary is refreshing! We were puzzled though as to why we were charged $7 for it. The drink isn't listed on the menu. There were communications problems telling the cashier what we wanted exactly.  It was the one you help yourself to in the beverage area. After our food arrived and the server gave us cups for the lemonade another server appeared 5 minutes later with two green drinks. HUH? Apparently the order taker was confused and thought we wanted the Harmony drink that had lemon in it even though we told her 3x and pointed to the drink counter.  They gave us a refund but my friend took part of that and still tipped the person who made those drinks for her trouble. 

Staff is friendly. Service is good. Obviously there are still some kinks to work out. It was soft opening and we took that into consideration. The prices they charge are a higher than the surrounding healthy based restaurants in the area and would probably be the deciding factor when choosing having lunch with my buds.  I'll definately will come here for the Pitaya bowls though."}
{"text":"DK Acai bowl FTW! It's the best Acai bowl I've ever had as they use only fresh ingredients. The other items on the menu seem good - I have not ventured out further than the acai bowl as I can't seem to NOT have it when i go there. They have a a la carte salad bar which has yummy side salads you can get which I recommend as well."}
{"text":"I absolutely love going to Daily Kitchen! There selection is really good and can accommodate to really any diet. For breakfast I usually get the DK acia bowl and it is to die for. If I stop by for lunch my go to is the mahi tacos, I really don't know how they make them so good!! Also always get the rosemary lavender lemonade!!"}
{"text":"I always love the food everyone is always helpful. 
It's always freshly made. It might take a little longer when you do a pick up because it's made fresh. The smoothies are delicious and no ice or water. But fruit."}
{"text":"Tastes great! Nice atmosphere.  Just saw a sign that says kids eat free on Sunday.  Cool that a place like this is so welcoming for little people.

Had the turkey burger and it was perfectly cooked, very tasty!"}
{"text":"We needed a fairly fast and informal place for dinner. We also wanted to try something that would be relatively healthy. The Daily Kitchen seem to fit the bill.

Ambiance: a fairly typical fast-food Eatery. You walk up to the counter to order. They prepare the meal and bring it to your table. The restaurant was very clean.
Service: this is a fast food restaurant so there is not much to say about the service per se. The people working behind the counter was very pleasant and helpful in terms of explaining the dishes.
Food: I ordered the southwest chicken bowl. It had a fairly large portion of the shredded chicken tinga. The chicken was a little bit spicy for a gringo palette but not too bad. There was a very generous portion of black beans and an even more generous portion fresh guacamole. For fast food this was a pretty good meal.
Value: a feeling tasty dinner that is fairly healthy in a brightly-lit, clean, fast food restaurant, all for $12. This is an excellent value."}
{"text":"What's the point of eating at a healthy eatery spot if they can't accommodate or adjust your order properly?

I placed an order online around 11:40 AM and noted to pickup at 12:30 PM. They offered curbside pickup, which is neat -- just have to note what your vehicle is, so that they can bring it out to you. My order was for the DK Burger with sweet potato fries, and in the special instructions I kindly requested to substitute the buns with lettuce wraps and to add no sugar to any seasoning on the fries and burger. Simple request, right?

I get there around 12:40 PM and the parking lot is full. I realized there is no dedicated spot for curbside parking/pickup, so the whole curbside pickup idea is useless. As I approach the cash register, the lady was kind as I told her that I was picking up an online order. There was some confusion between her and the staff on where my order was, but they eventually found it after a minute. She handed it to me and said somewhat snarky that \"my order has been sitting there for awhile\". I told her that I placed the order only an hour ago but that pickup was scheduled at 12:30 PM. They must've not followed through on this, as my food was indeed cold. Her, along with the manager, gave me the option to recook my food and apologized to me. I was kind about this, but turned it down. Ended up taking my food and eating it cold, which was fine.

What really got me, though, was when I went to eat my food and discovered that they did not accommodate the special instructions I requested! There were two buns and no lettuce wraps , and it wasn't as easy as removing the buns, since the burger was all messy with the shredded lettuce. And because of this, I wasn't too sure if sugar was or was not used. I ate it anyways, but let's see if my blood sugar elevates throughout the day.

I'm not sure if I'll give this place another chance. The food tasted okay -- it was $11 altogether which seems fair. But even though they showcase themselves as a healthy eating spot, they aren't willing to accommodate to special diet restrictions, which I know most healthy eateries do."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try this place out for the acai bowls.  I had to choose from only 2 options since the 3rd was not available at the time. The bowl looked great when I got it but when I took a bite it was not very good. It was bitter at the bottom and the honey on top was too much and changed the flavor of the bowl to overwhelming honey taste. Not what I expected, ended up only eating half because the flavor was too overwhelming.  Waste of 10 bucks."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Daily Kitchen and  I was ordering for the whole office. This is only a review of their phone ordering and take out process. 
The employee who took my order was great. Good phone presence, polite, and easy to understand. They answered all of our questions about the menu items. 
I went and picked up the food. It was ready right when they said it would be (not many places can do that).  Since I order for others, I always check the food before I drive away. Everything was perfect. All of the modifications were correct. They even labeled the boxes! It made my life a lot easier. 
Everyone enjoyed their food. It tasted fresh and delicious. I was surprised it was pretty empty around 11:30. We will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Spacious, clean, modern. Organic (even the ketchup!), non gmo, and yet yummy! Got the bison burger with this interesting cilantro salsa sauce stuff.  Outdoors picnic tables. Interesting combos of flavors. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My first time to Daily Kitchen was a great experience. I had the Captain Planet Juice and the Quesadilla, poured some hot sauce and was good to go. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The Rosemary vanilla lemonade is worth just coming to this place just for that! The chicken tinga is pretty spicy so be ready for that when you order it. So far I have been here 2 or 3 times and had the market counter items- always great. Today I got the chicken Caesar wrap so will have to update my review once I try it. Not 5 stars because it is pretty expensive."}
{"text":"I rate on food thus the 4 but the overall was probably closer to a 2.8

4 for the food. 

2.5 for the service. The cashier was nice but overcharged my husband and I so we talked with the manger. The manager was super snarky. After we started to walk away from the counter she said loudly \"I'm glad you overcharged them!\" That was really rude and created a very uncomfortable and awkward eating experience. 

Which is really to bad because this type of food is really right up my alley and I'm sure I would have been a regular here cuz the food really is my niche. 

Honestly, I probably will go back very sporadically despite this experience but I will choose Protein House, Greens & Protein, Lyfe Kitchen over them if given the opportunity and never return here with my husband as he just won't chance another experience like that again and isn't into this type of food as much as I am."}
{"text":"I got the dk acai bowl & it was so good. Super fresh & refreshing. I can't wait to go back again. The place is a walk up & order type restaurant. Very clean & spacious. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Very clean. Lots of Gluten Free items if you need that.  Like the food but super expensive for the quantity. Staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat when I'm in that part of town.  I usually get the Market Bowl with Brown Rice and Quinoa and Grilled Tofu with a selection of three of their fresh market salads.  My favorites of the salads are the Snap Pea, Mint, and Goat Cheese Salad; the Roasted Cauliflower; the Rainbow Roasted Carrots Salad, and the Mediterranean Salad with Avocado, Cucumber, Tomato.  I love each and every one of their fresh smoothies, and their Flavored Iced Tea is addictive.  I appreciate how they offer complimentary almond milk and also Stevia as a sweetener option when I get coffee there.

I love how fit most of the customers are.  It is a testament to the healthy options presented here.  There is always lots of post-gym eye candy to enjoy while eating."}
{"text":"I really like the food at this place. I usually get the \"build your own\" with three salads and a daily braise. The rainbow carrots are sooo good. I get them every time. The only complaint, and why I didn't give 5 stars, is because the customer service is horrible (I've been to the Green Valley location over 10 times). The people don't say \"hello, welcome,\" they don't look up from the register when taking your order, and they just need some extra training in the customer service department. Customer service is SO important and the staff here have zero. Otherwise, it's a good place."}
{"text":"I really like this place.. one of the only places in vegas that don't play around with the ingredients...I'm a California girl... I grew up with these places all over..vegas was hard to find a place like this.. fresh ingredients without a puree or some kind of sweetner...CAPTAIN PLANT...... HOWEVER my small request is open early enough for ppl to come b4 work and school.. by 9am ppl have already started there day!... open at 7am... JUST A SUGGESTION"}
{"text":"I just found out this location closer. Sad news. Hope  something that offers organic healthy options takes its place."}
{"text":"I just can't keep away from this place! ! Food is always fresh and delicious!  Customer service is always a pleasure"}
{"text":"This place opened up last month and i have been in about 4 times since opening. I wanted to try various thing in the menu before i could write an honest review. First of i love how chill this place is, there is always people just lounging on there lap tops enjoying the WiFi and sipping on there healthy juices. 
       The service is alright. The food is pretty good iv'e ordered the fish tacos and bison burger and quesadilla and i enjoyed all 3! Portions are decent.You get what you pay for, the ingredients are high quality and i love that fact that you can get grass fed meats. I would much rather spend a few dollars extra for good fresh tasting food. However $10 for scrambled eggs, that is completely ridiculous, not to mention the fact that i still have to pay for a drink. This place is kinda over priced. There is no calorie count on menu which really makes me and some of my friends question how \"healthy\" this place really is.

I have tried two of their juices so far and they are so strong and overwhelming i could not finish it I threw them away!! More then $7.00 for a small juice, very pricey. If it would have been good it could be worth it but the both i tasted were awful! I tired so hard to drink it because i didnt want to waist it but I couldn't."}
{"text":"Great ingredients! Chocolate chip oatmeal pancakes are delicious! Organic options are great! We love the mindfulness behind the menu options. Protein scramble was great!"}
{"text":"Service here is always friendly and prompt. Their food is so delicious, yet super healthy! I suggest the DK Acai Bowl and Soba Noodles with chicken! Sooooo yummy.

Also, they have this rewards program that's like a virtual stamp card but via phone number. Much more convenient than carrying around stamp cards."}
{"text":"I had read the reviews before I came into town and this place did not disappoint!  For breakfast one day I had the Farmers scramble with steel cut plain pancakes and it was absolutely amazing!!!!!  It was probably one of the best breakfasts I had ever had!  Another day I tried the bison burger which I have to admit was not that great.  Would I order it again? NO.  I took a grilled cheese sandwich and vegan chocolate chip cookies to go and again it didn't disappoint.  I give it a 5 because everything besides the bison burger was amazing.  Come to TExas please!!"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic dining experience for lunch today at Daily Kitchen. The staff was upbeat and diligent. I appreciated how nice everyone was and how great our food was. This is a great addition to the limited healthy choices on Eastern and we will certainly be back. If only just to have more Rosemary Vanilla Lemonade, it's addicting."}
{"text":"Yum, I had the bison burger here and it was delicious.  I found them to have a very interesting selection of healthier dining options here.  The staff is very friendly.  It is a bit pricey for a fast casual restaurant, but I don't mind spending more for healthier food.  It took a bit longer then I expected for my food to be prepared but my order was perfect and packaged carefully to go."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The staff is always so friendly and helpful. The food is always amazing and the lemonade should be enough to get you in the door. I seriously have nothing negative to say about this place!"}
{"text":"I LOVE eating at Daily Kitchen!! Our office buys it once a week and I'll go a few times more after work. The tinga tacos are really delicious. It's a great place to get healthy food without having to cook."}
{"text":"Was excited to come with a group of friends after we worked out. Got there 20 minutes before close, all chairs were on the tables. There were 3 workers there and NO ONE acknowledged us. So we naturally asked if they were still open. No response... asked again and their response \"I guess\" with an attitude like we do not want you here. NEVER trying this place and McDonald's gives me better service. I would suggest going to greens and proteins. Much better service!!! FYI owner/manager 2/22/17 on 7:39Pm!"}
{"text":"Ahi tacos the best period. AJ the cook should be working  in
a upscale dining  establishment"}
{"text":"I do have one gripe. I have come in here a few times, been the only person in the place, and it takes a long time for food to come out. We are talking simple stuff like pancakes. I don't expect nor want, McDonalds \"fast\" food but do appreciate some focus on me as the customer there as opposed to prepping some other stuff for later in the day."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch while visiting the area. It was around 3pm and the place was pretty empty. Very clean. Has an urban/industrial/simple/clean look. The girl behind the counter that helped us as we ordered was friendly. 

We ordered and our food was brought out to use after a few minutes. Both wraps we ordered were a good size and presented nicely. Husband and I agreed that the taste was very light and fresh. I ordered a turkey avocado wrap with a creamy cilantro dressing. I liked the hint of cilantro, but I wish there was a little more of it in the wrap. It was just a bit on the dry side. The roasted cauliflower I got as a side still had a nice crunch to it. Natural sweetness with a hint of tangy but not too overpowering. The tortillas that came with my husbands chicken Caesar wrap was fresh and went well with the side of salsa. 

Overall a pretty decent experience."}
{"text":"If you have not been to this gem....you MUST run there now. So delicious! I have never been disappointed by everything I have tried: black bean burger, grassfed burgers, market salads, korean briscuit and even there kids PB and J."}
{"text":"my wife and I really enjoyed our visit to this establishment. I had the bison burger which was excellent. I also had the best sweet potato fries I have ever had. we definitely will be back. I have eaten at the same restaurant on the other side of town and it was just as good."}
{"text":"High-quality, clean, fresh and flavorful food. This place slayed me. Coming back when I get hungry again."}
{"text":"Really, really, really good! The food was awesome, but I'm pretty sure that my new favorite drink in the entire world (besides Fireball) is their Vanilla Rosemary Lemonade. I think I done drunk about 3 of em' while waiting for my food to be ready. I was like Forest Gump with Dr. Pepper but worse. 

I ordered the Caesar Wrap and subbed Sweet Potato fries on the side. The fries were outstanding, the wrap was really good. I chose the Tomato wrap, which I thought was excellent. The lettuce was fresh and crispy, the Caesar dressing wasn't overpowering, and the chicken was moist. Thought it could have used a little more chicken as the lettuce to chicken ratio was probably 3 to 1 and several bites I had were just lettuce. My wife ordered the Thai wrap and loved it, especially the peanut sauce.

The service was really good - especially when I messed up my wife's order completely. They fixed everything despite it being my fault. NOTE - when you order the collared greens wrap just know you actually get a collard green, not a tortilla wrap (duh!). 

Great healthy option in Henderson. I'll definitely be back for a refill on the lemonade!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we give the service 5 stars and the food 4 stars!

Great, fresh meal choices. The service team will offer you a sample of anything you would like to try! The Rosemary Vanilla Lemonade is a must!

The Ahi Tuna Tacos were divine, my sister in law had the Korean Brisket tacos (DELISH!) and my man had the Turkey Chili over quinoa, that he enjoyed."}
{"text":"Only place we could find near Vegas with thoughtful ingredients. We had breakfast and then ordered lunch to go too! Everything was good!"}
{"text":"Wow what an absolutely pleasureful experience, from the warmness of the person who rung me up to the above and beyond product quality and quantity this place will be a staple for me when I come to visit my brother and hopeful from my word of mouth a regular stop for him. I got the very berry with spinach and whey protein added and it has that satiating thickness and depth of flavor like I made it myself at home! Delicious and wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Daily Kitchen is an excellent healthy option in town. You don't have to spend a fortune to get a nice healthy feel good meal. Their Market Salad is great. Pick three salads for $9. (I recommend their Kale Salad.) You can add Tofu for $3 or chicken/salmon for $5. Their DK(the other DK ;)) Acai Bowl is amazing. Their fruit is always ripe which is a must for a good Acai Bowl ($10). Nice selection of fruit on top, a drizzle of honey and bee pollen, which is excellent to consume if you suffer from seasonal allergies. Great selection of fresh squeezed vegetable and fruit juices. I try to switch it up each time I visit. They also have Wellness shots for $3, or wheatgrass shots for $4 if you want a pick me up, but don't want to go the full Juice route. Awesome selection of wraps/sandwiches that run about $10. Add a market salad for just $1 more. I love that they use good quality ingredients. Their turkey and chicken are the good stuff, not like that slimey gross stuff you see at other places. They have a kids menu with Almond butter and jelly, grilled cheese, quesadilla, etc. all around $5. Inside and outside seating, both have a nice, relaxed vibe. The staff is super friendly here, always checking in to make sure you're doing ok. I'm super happy that Daily kitchen is nearby so there's always a healthy option for take out when I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Place is just not
Up to par. When we were there it was a mess, rude management, staff was not knowledgeable and the cook was unsanitary. My daughters quesadilla still had the paper wrapped around the cheese melted in the quesadilla, when i brought it up to management, she looked at me like I was crazy and I did something wrong. She offered to make me another one but at  that moment I was through with them and we just decided to get up and leave. Food is bland, place is dead, they are done, what's next?"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ordered my burger with no onion and no tomato. Goto our seat. My buddy gets his salad. My burger comes about 10 minutes later. He's already done. The burger comes with onion and tomato. I told the girl in the sea foam green shirt that I ordered it without those items.  She scowls at me and tells me to put it in her hand.  Then after she leaves I realize they didn't put cheese on my burger. I wave down another employee that my burger is missing cheese. I explain I have to go and my friend is already done with his meal. Can I just get a piece of cheese. Next the girl in the green shirt comes over agitated and says you wanted cheese. That's one of the ingredients on the menu. Yes I want cheese. She keeps offering to make my meal again. I once again tell her my friend is already done eating and I don't have time for another burger to be cooked. She asked if I wanted something else. I told her I just wanted the cheese. She kept asking so much my buddy interjected and said He just wants the cheese. End of story. Bad service. By the way the line was out the door practically with one register open. Seen two people walk out. Just some advice. If the salad is done first. Put it in the fridge until the hot meals are ready so everyone can eat together. Or make the salad after the hot meals are done since they are so easy to make. Watching my friend eat then me watching him is not my idea of having lunch with someone."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and this time with my son. Didn't know on Sundays that kids eat free so big bonus there. Ordered the Brisket Tacos and I'm definitely a fan. Portion was perfect, meat was tender and flavorful. Just the right kick to the tacos. My son enjoy his grilled cheese, vegan cookie and sweet potato fries. I think I'll be making this my Sunday ritual with my kids."}
{"text":"I got one of their breakfast wraps and ordered sweet potato fries with it. The wrap was awesome the fries were a bit over cooked for my liking. I would try them again. The DK wrap was very filling. I was satisfied for sure. Customer service was pretty awesome too! I love their Rosemary lemonade so refreshing, I think I will break the bank as much as I patron here"}
{"text":"Good stuff, I had the Dragon Bowl it was delicious. My wife liked the soba noodle bowl she had. Nice big portions, we will be going back."}
{"text":"Love the Daily Kitchen! 

Their juices and their Dragon Acai Bowl are my favorites! The Acai Bowl is a really large portion. Or perhaps I just don't eat that much. But, I'd definitely say it's good enough for two people to share or two servings. 

The Turkey Chili is also awesome. I had it in the middle of the blazing hot summer and it still hit the spot. I can only imagine how awesome it'll be to
Indulge in during the winter. 

They have soups of the day that often include pretty interesting dishes... One day I was there and I think they had some type of Korean Brisket Stew. I hadn't tried it and opted for something else but now I definitely wish I would have had a sample.

They also offer a make your own salad type of bar and the lemonade and tea here is a definite must try if you're not going to order a juice with your meal. 

Fast service, limited seating area but that never has seemed to be a problem. If you order to go, they pack the food very well for transport. If you're in the area, try it! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my last review since I had been coming here and getting the DK smoothie bowls after a workout. BUT...Getting you're meal is incredibly slow (except for when the owner is there) I went with two other people and it took 25 minutes for one us to get a meal, then another 10 minutes for my tacos, and they completely forgot my mom's wrap and two people who came in after us got their meals before us. The food is great! The service not so much though, kinda disappointing when it's not consistent"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place wasn't packed when I came in on a Saturday morning! I love that it is all healthy but DELICIOUS options on the menu. I got the DK acai bowl and it was to die for! So good! I can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"Enjoying this place so far; it's all I can think about this week. I've been here 2 times this week and considering going there again a third time. I have yet to venture outside of the market bowls to the other half of the menu. I just enjoy the options you can create with the market bowls. For $11, you can pick your base (brown rice, quinoa, or kale), pick meat, and add 2 side salads of your choice. My favorites are the mung bean noodle salad and the snap peas and goat cheese. The food is light: you can't sense much oil or fat. But it's filling enough that I leave satisfied, not gluttonous. It's a great meal that I can grab on my way to work. 

The rosemary lemonade is made in-house; I want to order it next time. Sounds delicious. There are happy hours throughout the morning and evening for discounted smoothies or side salads. 

Atmosphere: Clean, organized. The benches are comfortable. There is even a bar for those who want to sit alone. I like the use of metal piping for decoration. Background music is Top 40, mainstream music. Nothing too distracting. The kitchen is open; you can watch them make your food right behind the cashier. 

Staff: Very nice and helpful. They allow you to try samples of the different side salads and meats, so you can choose wisely. They are also very keen to provide suggestions and are ready to answer any questions you have. 

Products: They use recycled cardboard/paper bowls. Don't worry. They're sturdy. 

Can't wait to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Wow! Love at first bite. I stopped by here for lunch and ordered the Spicy Thai Chicken wrap. I was looking for something that has a nice kick to it, and this wrap had some zing!!I was very impressed and it was the perfect size for lunch. My wrap also came with a side of couscous, which was delicious. The couscous had parm cheese and cilantro that added good flavor! 

I can't wait to come back here and try a smoothie and a salad! They have an endless amount of healthy options. What was great about this place, was after I ate, I didn't feel bloated and overstuffed. As mentioned earlier, it was the perfect size and the healthy options made me feel like I made the best choice for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food! It's so hard to be straight paleo when you eat out, unless you want to be stuck eating salads all the time. But daily kitchen does a great job of making it easy and tasty. I usually build my own protein bowl and substitute kale for the rice and it's great!"}
{"text":"Plenty of delicious gluten free options! The ahi tuna tacos are delicious. The brisket tacos are great and not fatty or greasy. Their sweet potato fries are addicting! This place is my new obsession. Great food for a reasonable cost!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. I love everything from the delicious vanilla lemonade that they serve, to the friendly/efficient service, to the healthy entrees they offer like the Southwest Chicken Bowl or the Grass-fed Bison Burger. The acai bowls are to die for, as well. I could go on and on about how every food item is great because I'm pretty sure I've tried almost everything. I've tried all of the tacos, and the DK Breakfast wrap is a way healthier and filling alternative to your fast-food remedies. They don't add any preservatives to their food, and their smoothies/health shots are all natural ingredients. You can always call in and get everything made before you come in so it's quick and easy, too. The cashier Angelo always gives the best recommendations to everything I have tried here! He is always serving with a smile on his face and it's refreshing to have such friendly service when I come in. Love this place!"}
{"text":"At Daily Kitchen they serve delicious healthy and organic meals. They are very friendly and helpful there as well! My favorite items are the Acai bowl, the brisket, the turkey chili. Normally I don't like my food to touch each other, but I got 3 salads in one container and they were all delicious even though they were placed next to each other: the roasted cauliflower, mung bean salad, and kale salad with a delightful vinaigrette. We are moving to another state and this restaurant is definitely one of our favorites that we'll remember from Henderson!  Let me not forget the smooth and refreshing organic iced tea and rosemary and vanilla lemonade. You must try some of these delicious items and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came back for the second time and they changed the menu. For the pick 3 you can only pick the items that are already cooked whereas before you can pick the fish and now you will have to pay more to get it. They said it's because it takes too long for customers to wait. The sides are still good but I wish they offer main entree that are cook in front of you like grill chicken similar to Green Proteins."}
{"text":"I can't really write a lengthy review I always get the same thing, the Acai bowl. Souch natural sugar it's like a healthy dessert. DK has wellness shot in 3 styles detox, relief and energy $3 each I consider those a great deal. That's all I have say. :)"}
{"text":"They have some great healthy options and I love that their menu is labeled for various food allergies and that they have an organic chicken option. My go to is always the market salad with a braise added to it. Only reason I'd give it 4 stars instead of 5, is that both myself and friends, have found bones in the chicken tinga, and that they are ALWAYS out of the Kale Salad. I love that they make the market salads fresh everyday, but if you are ALWAYS out of the kale salad, maybe it wouldn't hurt to prep more of it."}
{"text":"Snack time!

I'm not sure how healthy Grass-Fed Korean Street Tacos really are, they probably lean more on the side of \"less bad\" for me than \"healthy\". 

The Grass-Fed Korean Street Tacos are filled with braised meat cooked in Asian red-chili paste, with house made salsa, all inside mini-corn tortillas. This meal also comes with tortilla chips and a side of salsa. The tacos were good, very juicy and full of flavor. The cilantro inside was a nice touch, but they did need some acid and a hint of heat. 

While eating the tacos, I didn't get how \"Korean\" fit into the name or flavor profile. I wasn't getting any Asian flavors, more Mexican than anything. The sides of chips were stale, but not enough to ruin the meal. 

They service here was quick from ordering to food delivery, but to be fair, when we arrived the place was empty. 

BONUS: They sell multiple flavors of Lucky Jack bottled Iced coffee. I bought two bottles for $7. A little pricey, but I'm sucker for iced coffee. 

Would I come back? Yes, but not sure how soon that will be."}
{"text":"Just tried it for the first time although I have been meaning to go for a while. The chicken rings tacos are DELICIOUS!! I also had the lemonade with vanilla and rosemary. So good! I will definitely be making a lot more trips to DK, as I was impressed. The cost is a bit much, but when you know you are putting organic GMO-free food into your body, it's worth it in my opinion!!"}
{"text":"Great food, and guess what? It's healthy! This location is on Eastern next to Nevada State Bank. You will be welcomed to friendly staff and a clean and well decorated dining room. The ingredients are fresh, and was made to order. The tacos and sweet potato fries were promptly made and brought to me. The grass-fed brisket tacos were juicy and flavorful! I enjoyed the sweet potato fries as well. I definitely will have to return to try their acai bowls!"}
{"text":"First time checking this place out and loved it! Had the turkey burger and sweet potato fries... Delish! Their menu sounds amazing can't wait to try the rest out. Oh also try their organic lemonade :)."}
{"text":"Promising health spot! My hubby enjoyed his protein bowl with the salads he sampled. My 3 year old had the quesadilla kids meal. He liked the quesadilla but the sweet potatoes were kind of burnt and he was not a fan of the cookie. I was hoping to try the grilled chicken sandwich or salmon but was told they were out of both (6pm on a Thursday?). The chicken my hubby had was slightly spicy for me, as were the salads. Good if you can handle spice! 

The girls behind the counter were really nice. Not sure why the kids meal came out last (and after another party was served who came after) but willing to try again."}
{"text":"I love this place! Friendly staff, great food and the rosemary vanilla lemonade is the best I've ever had! I ordered the Homemade Turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Everything was fresh, hot and tasted delicious. Definitely my go to place for guiltless/healthy obsession. If I could give it more stars I would!"}
{"text":"First off, I did not try anything here. The reason I am writing this review and giving them two stars is four in accurate information being shared to its customers. I originally spoke to a girl named Devon who informed me that everything they use (fruits and vegetables) are organic. I went in today to try one of their juices or smoothies and the original employee that I asked did not know what was and wasn't organic. I was finally informed that none of the fruits or veggies in the smoothies or juice are organic. The in accurate information, The fact that they don't serve organic juice or smoothies, and the fact that I wasted my time going in here is why I am giving this poor review"}
{"text":"Love the juices here. They have great breakfast too. I like the harmony the best. Yogurt bowl is goos"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Daily Kitchen! Turkey chili  and the Truffle Couscous are my favorites. Always a good place for a quick, healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Wow waited 18 minutes for them to make decaf coffee. Then they bring out the farmers scramble and it is ice cold!!!! Alondra at the counter doesn't offer to remake it or offer another item. She processes the refund (I think) back to the card no attempts to make it right. Zilch!!!! Few times I was here before the manager seemed engaged and helpful. What happened!!! Wow will never come back and I will be keeping an out on my CC bill to see if this woman at least got that right."}
{"text":"Amazing turkey chili!
Salads are great too!
Healthy food choices!
Always great service and friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I work in Henderson and I'm always looking for new places to eat that aren't fast food. I saw Daily Kitchen open across the street, looked at the menu, and decided I needed to eat there. I went there around 12:00 pm on a Wednesday afternoon. All the tables were taken for the most part but it didn't seem packed. It was very clean and had a nice ambiance.
I ordered the Korean street tacos and filled up my cup with their organic rosemary vanilla lemonade which was really good. I then sat down and waited
.....
and waited
and waited
....
Everyone else got their order before me, I was on my lunch break so time was limited, after 25 minutes I spoke to someone working there and was assured they'd be right out. I was visibly irritated at this point, did they import them directly from Korea? I should have gone to taco y taco. After my mental grumbling my tacos were delivered. They were moist and delicious, didn't have any asian flavor but they were good regardless. I was surprised at how good they were honestly I usually don't trust $10 tacos. The chips were a miss; hard and flavorless. 
I would come back, probably, just not on my lunch break. Waiting a half hour at a casual dining place is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Good ! Yuppie like! Clean but not too
Much organic food! Just a trendy place to have a smoothie! Smoothies are great!"}
{"text":"This would be a great spot to meet up with a friend and sit outside! The staff was very helpful at navigating the menu and helping me decide on lunch. There a lot of options for various diets and I was pleased with their GF selection. I opted for the Korean Beef Tacos. The 4 tacos were the perfect size and I left feeling satisfied and not overly full. It would have been beneficial to have the side salads and braised meats in view from the register because I probably would have tried one (they looked delish! ) but I did not see them until after I paid. The seating was comfortable and they also had outside seating available.  Overall, my experience was very positive and have since recommended it to others on a GF diet."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The staff is so helpful and willing to let you try anything before you order. The food is healthy and made with fresh ingredients. All of the wraps I've tried are great and you can't go wrong with the protein bowls."}
{"text":"So far so good (at least for the most part) 

At first our ordering was a little chaotic. The girl was very detailed and explained about each of the items and offered us a lot of samples so that we could try before choosing what to order. I'm glad they did because the turkey chili was delicious. I never would have really tried it otherwise but YUM! 

I ordered the Korean tacos. They come with four pretty small tacos but for around $10 it is a pretty good deal. I was surprised that the meat was served cold on the tacos but it was good. The tortilla chips could have been better and maybe serve with a little more salsa. *1 two ounce portion cup is not enough. 

The bf ordered the turkey chili and a protein bowl filed with things he had sampled. I really liked the avocado salad & the veggies. We also ordered two juices and both were really good. I know the bf lined that his had cayenne in it. 

A few little quirks that probably still need to be worked out as with any new place but my biggest complaint would be temperature. It was absolutely freezing, only a little warmer than outside. I had to keep my heavy coat on the whole time and I noticed another customer also had hers on. The staff didn't seem to be cold in just their fitted t-shirts. The place has a lot of windows so I hope they are able to manage temperature better in the future. Regardless we'll def be back even though my bf doesn't love the places where you order before you sit. ;)"}
{"text":"Great improvements since first opening.  The food is tasty, the service is fast. 
Excellent for lunches!!!!"}
{"text":"First timer. Found a hair in my omelette. Then I received attitude from the girl at the register when I asked her if they could make me a new one. Surprised she did not apologize. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"So this was my first time eating here, I've passed by it 1 million times.  The people there are very friendly.  I got the burger and sweet potato fries.  the burger was ok nothing exciting about it.  ( I should have gotten the Brisket Tacos) I liked the sweet potato fries, but I loved the lemonade!  I'm not sure if they serve that all the time, if your in the area, stop by and get a nice cold glass of lemonade, it's amazing."}
{"text":"This is my new spot! I had the Kale salad 9/10 Carrot salad 10/10 and grass fed brisket 9/10...My tummy was full (did a grown man just say tummy?) and i didn't feel like crap afterwards.

Anyway, if you like living and eating tasty food, give these guys a shot, You will be glad that you did.

1Love!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place so much but I can't overlook the obv. The workers are lazy and the manager is oblivious. Second time I went in it wasn't busy yet most of the tables were dirty and there was a spill in the middle of the floor that no one seemed to notice or care about. After reading the review about the hand washing station it doesn't surprise me. I won't be going back. Lyfe Kitchen is so much better anyway and they put the calories on everything."}
{"text":"First off this place is delicious and I love the acai bowls. Unfortunately the customer service is poor- the employees do not seem knowledgeable. It feels like a bunch of high school kids are running the place. Other than that every thing is delicious and that is why I choose to come
Back."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that this place has never satisfied me! I am very easy to please and yes the food is pretty good. However, every single time I go (which has been numerous since I always want it to prove me wrong) I wait for SO long. It doesn't matter how many people are in front of me. Then, on top of that, even at 5pm they are almost always out of their salads and other items on the menu. Daily Kitchen, I love your business idea but there needs to be better service, more food and less wait time."}
{"text":"I post-mated this place quite a bit during my time in Vegas. I really enjoyed their juices, especially the beet ones with chia seeds added. Their tinga was not as spicy as I would like it, sort of lacking in flavor a bit. Disappointed in it in taco form, but I had it on the salad another day and it was ok. My favorite thing from here were the wellness shots and I was super impressed with what they use for delivery. Small, sealed hard plastic shot glasses. Really helped keep my immune system up while traveling."}
{"text":"How come no one has ever told me how yummy acai bowls are! I will def be back for that!"}
{"text":"Sad! The door says healthy food but once you get inside do be fooled! The DK wrap for example is marked as a healthy wrap. Yet its loaded with fries fried in fat instead of baking like lyfe kitchen or protein house. I though i hd found another healthy place but i guess not. A real dissapointment. #FedUp i put them in with mcdonalds for blatantly lying and failing to complete a nutritional menu which would prove its not healthy"}
{"text":"For my taste, they're best for their Acai bowls and juices. I have had the carrot salad and was not impressed. Today, my issue is with the amount of time I had to wait for my Acai bowl, and the fact that THREE gals who ordered after I did received their cooked food minutes before I did and I had to ask someone about my bowl. I only came in because it was located between 2 appointments... I'll give my biz to Bowlology."}
{"text":"Wow this place is ammmmmmazing... Not only do they have organic ingredients, but the workers are really nice and the food was great. I ordered the turkey avocado wrap also i ordered the thai wrap for my boyfriend to go ans he loves it. Ill be going back soon. Finally a place I can eat at where im not going to get poisoned."}
{"text":"What don't I love about this place? Nothing! The Go Greek bowl and the bison burger are my favorites. But the salads and chicken ceasar wrap are awesome too. But the lavender honey lemonade....oh my!! Everything we've tried has been very yummy. Staff is hit and miss."}
{"text":"Really, it's 3.5 stars here, but I'll round up. To me, time is of the essence. If it's going to take 20-25 minutes to make a dragon bowl as it requires one to throw fruits and nuts into a bowl then forget about it. I can just make it at home... 

3 stars go to the food because it's actually pretty good. And 1/2 star to the employees. Although they were super slow they were also really nice and apologized for the food coming out so late.

Dragon bowl- just the right amount of sweet and sour from the pitaya blend. The coconut and granola gave it a lovely sweet crunchy texture.

DK Breakfast Wrap- great flavors, loved the crispiness of the turkey bacon and the addition of the sweet potato fries. Its like their rendition of a \"healthier\" California burrito."}
{"text":"Have to downgrade to 4 stars, went about 30 minutes to closing so I assume that was the reason for the mistakes but after being out of several things(informed after ordering and sitting down in the main dishes case). Salmon that we were given was very undercooked, at least half of it was barely edible. Hopefully they're better in the afternoon and not near closing."}
{"text":"I stood at the counter not being acknowledged by two kitchen workers ,for about 5 minutes.  Then I waited 20 minutes for 2 acai bowls to go!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to the DK Acai Bowl! So, so delicious -- any time of day. Tonight it's my dinner! And now I have the loyalty app, so I'm on my way to earning some offers I hope! 
I have to say that I prefer this menu over the Summerlin location (although their staff over there  is an 11 on a 10-point scale, plus really fast). My only request is that you please open a location in Southern Highlands!"}
{"text":"I came in on 4th of July and was glad they were open. I was greeted by a smiling young Asian woman who was likely the owner as i don't think anybody can possibly be that happy at work. Clean menu and love that they offer Acai bowls. I went after a breakfast burrito because that's simply what i was feeling for. Good, not greasy, and fresh ingredients and bonus points for a yummy sweet potato hash in it. Do check it out if your working in the area and you need a healthy alternative to the typical chain food garbage you stuff your face with."}
{"text":"Walked in and was very relaxing environment. Was greeted with a \"good morning\" & \"welcome\" which was nice. I have never been here before so they lady helped me order. 

I got a burrito with sweet potato fries, salsa, turkey bacon w/ eggs. Also with the organic coffee. I was very impressed :) I will say that's my new favorite breakfast burrito. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"We've ordered from here multiple times and although the concept is good they always forget to add meat to our orders, it's as though they have some sort of meat shortage and the wraps are made with almost no meat at all, salads are always missing the meat, we've tried for 2nd 3rd and 4th chances but continue to be disappointed. No thanks! Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Dined here tonight - pleasantly surprised. Smoothie was very creamy, had great texture and taste better than the smoothies I order from Whole Foods. 

I ordered bison burger wrapped in collard green leaf with a very spicy avocado sauce, good.  

Guacamole and chips were good but the chips were a bit too salty. I try to avoid salty foods. 

Improvement from my previous review but with Protein House, Green & Proteins, Lyfe Kitchen and food you can order from Whole Foods, Daily Kitchen has competition. 

Too bad there isn't Tin Leaf establishments here, now that's great healthy, organic food!"}
{"text":"Ever since Daily Kitchen opened I have wanted to try it. Being a fan of \"au naturale\" eateries, DK is as good as I'd hoped. Upon entering it suggests that trendy modern meets organic kitchen feel that has been become more popular. Dark green booths and black utilitarian chairs paired with wooden planked walls definitely holds that back to the earthy basics vibe. 
We ordered a DK Relief shot (Apple, ginger, lemon, turmeric) which was super fresh and yummy tasting. I also ordered a turkey burger that is was delicious! Probably the best turkey burger I have had in awhile. Generous amounts of avocado, tomato and sprouts stacked one on top of the other, was quite satisfying. Sweet potato fries are also included. My friend ordered the DK acai bowl and said it was really good, better than the Jamba Juice version across the road. 
My bill for DK juice shot, turkey burger and a bottle of aloe water was $17 and change. 
I'll definitely return to DK, next I'd like to try the Pitaya bowl, chicken tinga tacos, ahi tuna tacos, soba noodle bowl or turkey chili with quinoa. The smoothies and other juices look pretty yummy, too. 
They have long tables with plug-ins for your laptops or cell phone chargers, it is a casual atmosphere that is nice for lunch with friends or for doing work on your laptop and grabbing a bite. They have breakfast, lunch and dinner options. 
Nice bonus; kids eat for free on Sundays!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! The food is delicious AND it's healthy! I've tried the bison burger, ahi tuna tacos, and their market salad. All their salad selections are really good. I usually hate quinoa BUT the quinoa here is so good!!! This place literally changed my mind about healthy eating.

Please give this place a try and I don't think you can tell me I was wrong."}
{"text":"Healthy, flavorful and many options to choose from! I choose the Build your own Market Salad and Braise. There are seasonal and daily specials, but mine included a truffle cous cous, tomato, avocado cucumber salad, and kale salad. I choose grilled chicken and quinoa for my Braise. I can't wait to come back to try other salads and items!"}
{"text":"Forget acai, the pitaya bowls at Daily Kitchen are amazing (I haven't had their acai bowls yet, I'm sure they're just as good!). The Dragon Bowl was made with blended pitaya, apple juice, mango and pineapple with fruit+granola toppings. Pitaya bowls = the sweeter sister of acai bowls-and who doesn't like that? ;) 
The soba noodles were a little bland for me. The chicken was flavorful and the avocado paired with it perfectly, however the noodles/spinach needed a little something more. 
DK has tables, couches and bar style seating (with lots of outlets!) It's the perfect place to get some work done on the computer and enjoy a healthy meal/drink. Bikini season is just around the corner ;) 
20% off your meal during their soft opening (First 2 weeks??) 
I will definitely be back. I'm excited to try their wraps!"}
{"text":"It was a soft opening so there has to be some flexibility, however there were seven workers and we had to wait for 45 minutes for our food and it was well below average.  The burger was burned and bitter. The sweet potato fries were also under cooked. For the price of the food, you would expect a higher quality of food."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch one day last week. I had a paid afternoon off for my birthday and knew it needed to include a new restaurant. I've passed this place a couple of times and wondered if it was any good.

Even at prime lunch time it was easy to find a parking spot. Inside I found an inviting and clean space. The line wasn't long and there were several tables available. The menu had several options that appealed to me. Most items seemed to have Mexican or Asian influences. They also offer the infamous Acai bowls. I've never had one, but I'll have to come back and try one.

I opted for the Chicken Caesar Wrap with tortilla chips. I liked that there were several options for the type of tortilla and I chose the spinach tortilla. The chicken inside had a really nice grilled flavor. There was plenty of lettuce and the perfect amount of dressing. Everything in the wrap tasted fresh. I also enjoyed the tortilla chips and pico, but there weren't many chips. Next time I'd probably just take the $1 upcharge for a salad. The portion was perfect for me and left me satisfied without being overly full. The price for the wrap was very fair for the quality and size."}
{"text":"Delicious and Devin was particularly helpful and really just nice! Pleasure on our first visit ! We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Taking over the old Samurai Sams location on Eastern is a nice \"healthy\" fast-casual spot that seems to be the trend in the area.  You got G&P, Protein House, and an array of juice spots popping up.  I usually get their turkey chili w quinoa over here but recently they've started putting in garbanzo beans.  Since there are already an abundant amount of beans in the turkey chili, once they started adding in the garbanzos it was an overkill of beans and made the ratio of chili to beans unbalanced.  Please DK, if you guys are listening, please change it back to the original recipe as there was nothing wrong with it.  Other than that keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite lunch spots in Henderson. I ordered the Turkey Burger and my husband ordered the Southwest Bowl Salad. Lots of inside seating available. Food has been fresh and tasty on the two occasions I visited. Looking forward to trying a smoothie on my next visit."}
{"text":"Great place. First time here and everyone is so nice! I got the grass fed burger with goat cheese instead of cheddar cheese. With sweet potato fries and a berry berry smoothie. I am so coming back here. Me and baby at both full and happy. Next time I'm trying the dragon bowl. It looks amazing. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"WOW! After a mishap with my order from a previous visit, the director (Dominick) personally reached out to apologize by meeting with me and giving a complementary meal. I greatly appreciate and am impressed with the costumer service. Dominick made sure he corrected this by going out of his way to correct a previous mistake for a costumer. Aside from the great service, I look forward to trying more items on the menu. Delicious, healthy, and affordable! Thank you Dominick, I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  They have not been open very long and everything here is not organic but it is all fresh. 

They do have Organic eggs, chicken & grass fed beef, as well as wraps, sandwiches, salads, fresh juice and smoothies.

Now I have to say, they did have the best sweet potato fries I have had in a long time.

You walk in, place your order and they bring it to your table.  They do have filtered water you can enjoy while waiting for your food and juice or smoothie.

They also sell a variety of snacks, some are NON GMO verified...

We have been here twice and enjoy a place which has great food, great quality and the staff, all have been over the top friendly and helpful.

The staff gets a 5 star as well as the food.  We have few places in Vegas like this and this is a place that needs a LOT of support... they have a great location on Eastern & St Rose next to the hospital and I encourage you to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Everything is always fresh and delicious! So far I have tried the Turkey Avocado Wrap and the Turkey Burger and they're excellent. Choco Banana Power smoothie is really rich and filling as well I also recommend the vegan cookies too! Really great place, they're always friendly."}
{"text":"Everything I have had was great. The menu has lots of options. Love the little wellness shots. Good acai bowls. Great choice for healthy eats. Very friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Thumbs down.  Was very excited because I had hoped it would be like Lyfe Kitchen, healthy, original, vegan.  When we went to order, they assumed we had been there before and didn't explain the ordering concept.  Then they biffed our order and forgot our sweet potato fries, even when we asked for them again.  Never got them.  Then they charged us for the larger bowl when we ordered the smaller one.  They said the tofu couldn't count as one of the smaller sides, which means we got one side too few.  Very confusing for an empty restaurant where they had all the time in the world to explain things to us.  We doubt we'll try it again."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger from this place, terrible quality. Taste similar to the frozen you get in Walmart. The bun is not cooked or grilled whatsoever. Maybe I've been unlucky with what I ordered but definitely do not order the burgers !"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, always fresh and delicious. I ordered the noodles soba and they brought it and it wasnt exactly how I wanted it and immediately the owner took it back and redid it to perfection. Love this place, family owned!!"}
{"text":"Big portion, exceptional tasting, healthy fresh food. A must try. Love this place!!! Try the acai bowl or the rise and shine quesadilla, or any of their salads."}
{"text":"The NEW @dailykitchen located in Henderson, NV is now open. I am pleased to say it is AMAZING! I want to say thank you to Michael Vakneen for taking the time to explain the menu to me. I will be back tomorrow morning to sample the breakfast menu. Full review soon! - #edisongphotography #stardustfallout"}
{"text":"This restaurant has everything imaginable, opens 7AM -9PM all days of the week, serving breakfast lunch & dinner at ALL times of the day. Their first location was in town center and they've finally moved to Henderson! 
They've added a new element to their menu unlike the other location.., called the MARKETPLACE PROTEIN BOWLS (which in my opinion are the BEST go-to for lunch). Served with either brown rice or kale, your choice of protein (tofu, Korean brisket, grilled chicken, chicken tinga, or salmon) that is served over rice -next to the rice/ protein you can then choose 1-4 of the fresh market salads of your choice! Most of the salads are vegan or gluten free & rich in protein! 
Another thing to add is there juices AND smoothies are beyond incredible. With no sugar or preservatives just frozen fruit & some come with Greek yogurt! 
My favorites are the beauty juice and the harmony. Berry berry and green paradise smoothies are to die for  
I highly recommend the bison burger which is served with a side of Israeli couscous, the Ahi tuna tacos, the soba noodle salad, or the turkey avocado wrap. For breakfast the protein scramble is delicious with spinach and turkey bacon, and the DK BREAKFAST WRAP is amazing with sweet potato fries, salsa, turkey bacon and eggs in the wrap! YUMMMM, can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Sooo yum !! I got the dragon fruit bowl and it really inspired me to want to make this at home everyday. Very generous with portions and they provided me with an ice pack since I got it to go."}
{"text":"We are used to eating healthy so everything here is a great selection for us. Pleased with everything we ordered! And kids eat free (from the kids menu) on Sunday's. Perfect for a place to come after church as a family. How nice! :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here quite often! We love the burgers, tacos, & their acai bowls (the best in town, trust me I've tried a lot of them)! Service is always great here too :)"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to come here for the açai bowl.. 
I ordered the brisket tacos.. 

When you come in.. You notice how clean this place is! The menu is very simple.. And ordering isn't difficult and the staff members are very engaged and knowledgeable.. Can't ask for more! 

After you order. You can either sit or take your food to go. The food comes quick! These guys take what they do seriously.. 

I would come back here! Unfortunately my wife and I don't live here and I wish we could find a place like this near where we live! 

Thank you Daily Kitchen!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant when it opened and I liked the idea of it and I thought it was a beautiful space but there was something wrong and I never went back until now and in sure glad that I did.   The food and the service were excellent today and I will definitely be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Okay review time :) So today is my second time trying daily kitchen and I definitely will be back for more. The first time I came was originally for an acai bowl but I decided to buy a burger as well. I ordered the bison burger and after waiting quite sometime I was given a plan ground beef burger. Was a bit upset that I waited so long and didn't get my order but it was still really yummy. The dk bowl was the best acai bowl I have ever had. Good thing I got it to share its quite filling. That day was the day I fell in love with their lemonade! It's a must try and I will now get it everytime I am hear. So so so good! This time I decided to sit outside and enjoy and rise and shine quesadilla. I was amazed how yummy it was! It felt like I was derailing from a diet far worse than I actually was. I really enjoy that the portions aren't too large here. Just enough to be full without overeating. A bit pricey but that what is expected from a health kitchen.Overall staff is very friendly and the food is yummy. I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"Market bowls are pretty good.  Food is fresh, service is great, tons of options and I wish they had some in the NW side of town.  Two things they could add are 1) calorie counts on the meals 2) menu for market bowl is pretty small and it's confusing if you aren't talking with someone."}
{"text":"I won't be coming back, especially for the price I paid. 

I got the turkey and avocado wrap. It was good but not great. Decent size. Came with a side of couscous. The couscous a small hint of flavor to it, it was ok but not my thing. 

My husband got the bison burger. That was good too. I didn't like that the lettuce for the burger looked like chopped lettuce for a salad. It also came with the couscous but my husband didn't like it. So he didn't touch it. 

Got my son the almond butter jelly and it came with \"baked\" sweet potato fries. However it was served cold and soggy. My husband tried to tell me that it was baked that's why it's soggy. I said it was probably pre-baked in the morning because you can still have a crunch on anything baked and served hot/warm. It came out cold! Unfortunately we already placed a side order of those nasty sweet potato fries before we tried what came with the kids meal (it didn't specify that it came with it) 

If it wasn't for the couscous and not knowing the kids meal came with it, we wouldn't have spent the extra $3. The fries came out half way through our meal and it was still nasty. This time warm, bland and soggy. 

I can tell the girl at the register was new. As we walked up the register the manager (I believe) was scolding her for not doing something. That was awkward to hear as we were looking at the menu. Finally, the girl asked us if we have been there before and I said no and she didn't say anything else after. That was uhhh I guess you can say strange. Poor customer service, maybe. Aren't you suppose to help us decide. Introduce the menu. Something? She was nice young girl but needs more training. 

Seating was kind of weird. Everything was open seating, no privacy. Looks like a cafeteria. Anyway, there were only one table that could fit the 3 of us available that I noticed as we were paying. I saw the guy walk right by it and didn't clean it. So I I grabbed the table anyway and had to ask him to clean it as he walked by again. The awkward thing was, he asked us if we knew the table behind us was done. I mean, how the hell would I know. I'm not with them and I wasn't paying attention to the people behind me! Weird."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and just can't get enough. My favorite is the Chicken Caesar Wrap with a side of Greek Salad and Grilled Corn. The Grilled Corn is amazing. Everything is so fresh and the flavors are consistently delicious. Thanks for the wonderful food Daily Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Forget anything you read on here that's negative . This place is 5 stars all the way . This is a great , healthy spot to grab food any time of the day! I love their entire menu . The staff are all friendly and accommodating . I always recommend this place to anyone wanting a healthy alternative to the gut busting options out there ."}
{"text":"Such great food! We eat here at least once a week. So nice to have a healthy and yummy place to grab food. It's quick, delicious, and prices are reasonable. What more can you ask for! Glad to hear it's open later too! A+"}
{"text":"Awesome place for great clean food.  My wife are here 2 days in a row.   Let's make it 3"}
{"text":"Fresh delicious and well worth checking this place out.  Try the Korean tacos and their side salad for $1 more.  So good!!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious place to eat any time of day. Staff is friendly and placebos clean. I had The grass fed burger and sweet potato fries which was very tasty. Would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a healthier way of life."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super clean and modern inside, delicious food. And they let you taste the market salads :)"}
{"text":"Not very pleased with Daily Kitchen. First off the prices are outrageous for sub par food. Second the turkey in my turkey wrap was grey, yes that's right grey! I have eaten my fair share of turkey during my lifetime, but that was a first. Also the Southwestern Chicken Bowl should be advertised as a salad. There is nothing \"Bowl\" about it. Overall the food was below mediocre and priced way to high. That was surely my last time going there."}
{"text":"Being that this place is so close to my job, I tend to frequent it for lunch. My favorite dish so far is the chicken tinga tacos, with the turkey avocado wrap coming in as a second. The restuarant is clean, the staff is friendly, and the service is fast depending on the time of day you go. However, my only vice with this place is that they're annoyingly inconsistent. I've came in on several occasions asking for a side a guacamole, which I paid for, and then I'd come in a different day and they no longer offer a side of guac for an extra cost. I'll then wait two days just so I can miss the food, I'll come in again, and they offer it. Not sure if there's a miscommunication between employees, or on menu offerings in general, but you guys really need to get it together in that area (GRRRRR!!!!). Besides that, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Olivia was so helpful! She was a great representation of this business. She should be promoted. Very good management skills. Saved the day, and prevented a bad expenses. The food is fresh and on point! Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. There was an issue with my food but they corrected the problem and made my food over, very nice of them. They also gave me a free detox shot for the trouble. I would recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"Best black bean burger I've had. Convenient lunch spot. Great quality food and healthy. Very nice staff.  I go here about once a week for lunch and have recommended them to many friends and even non vegan non vegetarian people love the black bean burger!!!"}
{"text":"so happy to have healthy alternatives for food in this area.
the place is clean, has a great menu, a little pricey but organic always cost more."}
{"text":"Every time I come here to eat it is always so clean and the staff is friendly. Food is delicious. I like in Henderson we have many healthy food options/restaurants. And this is another  one on the list. If you don't have time to cook or meal prep, stop by Daily Kitchen and grab something to eat and/or drink."}
{"text":"It's our 2nd time here and we like this place. Food is so far have been great and the staff are friendly. You should give this place a try. Not only their food tastes good but the quality is impeccable. You feel good about what you ate unlike the cheap ingredients other places serve. This place is a winner!!!"}
{"text":"The food is completely overpriced for what you get and the staff is incredibly slow and apathetic"}
{"text":"Korean braised short rib with sweet potato, quinoa and a mediterranean salad. The short rib just fell apart. So yummy. Boyfriend had the turkey avocado  wrap, they are really large suggest  sharing, along with a couscous salad. He had the Green Paradise smoothie, almond milk,  spinach,  banana & coconut. Very tasty. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow. This place has excellent customer service and are really great at making you feel welcome. Especially a newbie. The food is very delicious and fresh made. I tried the market salad with some turkey meatballs. Both were delicious. Very flavorful, fresh and healthy. I wish there was one in my two homes- Houston, Tx and St Pete, Fl!"}
{"text":"I like everything about this place: the ambiance, the people, the service and the food. They had cold brew coffee (Lucky Jack Iced Coffee), coconut water, tea, juices, acai bowls, smoothies, wraps, sandwiches, market protein bowls, burgers, salads, tacos, etc. They're open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Rio Bowl:
Berries, almond milk, banana, acai, granola and honey. You can add vegan protein if you want for an extra charge. Consistency was good - not soupy, not thick. 4/5

Chocolate Chia Pudding:
Cocoa powder, chia seeds, almond milk, agave and vanilla. The flavor and texture was just right. 4/5

Market Bowl:
You get to pick 1 base (brown rice, kale or quinoa) + 1 protein (Korean braised beef, salmon, organic chicken or grilled tofu) + 1, 2 or 3 market salads.
I went with quinoa, Korean braised beef, kale and cauliflower. It was amazing. The beef was tender and lean - it reminds me of caldereta. I lovehow you can mix and match your bowl, 5/5

They give free samples of their smoothies sometimes, They also carry protein cookies."}
{"text":"First time here. I had the oatmeal pancakes and my husband had a wrap. We both enjoyed our food and I appreciate all the healthy options! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Limited menu.  Summerlin location is 100 times better.  Completely different restaurant.  You get better value in the menu in Summerlin.  The Modern Kitchen and Rotisserie atmosphere is missing at this Green Valley location. They have a completely different menu.  We ordered protein scramble and steel cut oatmeal. They took 25 minutes to serve our food.  I'd rather drive 15-20 minutes to the Summerlin location, which I love, love! Hope they convert this location to a Modern Kitchen and Rotisserie.  I bet it would be more successful."}
{"text":"I'm impressed. I had breakfast here and they made scrambled eggs, chicken, turkey bacon taste amazing. I saw the reviews about their vanilla Rosemary lemonade and I agree, it is delicious. They have something even better...vegan oatmeal chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time right after our workout. They give you chips with the wraps but kindly offered one of their salads instead. I asked her to choose between the cauliflower and Greek so she gave me a little of both. Ordered the spicy chicken wrap and asked for minimal sauce. They did an excellent job of getting a tiny amount of sauce in each bite but not drenched. Tasted extremely fresh and delicious. 

My husband is dieting pretty hard right now and is being extremely picky where we go. They kindly made him a side of ahi tuna seared to perfection for a good price. 

We both loved this place and will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place! The Ahi Tacos were really good! Nice slice of tuna with avocado and daikon radish slaw. There's four to the plate with tortilla chips. A perfect sized meal! Everything on the menu sounds amazing. I'm definitely coming back to try some of the other items."}
{"text":"Very convenient location.. And parking is great.. 

Coming in.. I was greeted with a very friendly cashier.. And explained the menu thoroughly.. And was offered some samples.. Awesome!!

This is where it started going downhill.. One of the workers.. (I assume was one of the chefs) started \"horse-playing\" around with the cashier who was helping us.. And by \"horse-playing\" tickling the cashier in her armpit right in front us.. Sure hoped that those hands didn't prepare my food..

As for the food.. I got the dk acai bowl.. a little over price than some acai spots that I went to.. and the portion was a little small.. if i wanted anything extra it would cost an additional $1.50.. even for a couple thin slices of a banana.. 

overall the acai bowl was good.. 

not sure if I would go back tho.."}
{"text":"This place is a delicious lunch break stop.. Slightly pricy but clean ingredients. Got my coworkers hooked on the acai bowls!!"}
{"text":"Great healthy food!!!
Love the smoothies and drinks. Love the tacos and burgers too. Only reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was a small chicken bone in my Thai chicken wrap. Its not so bad because there are real chefs making real fresh food and your going to get a small bone at even the best restaurants. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After my first review of Daily Kitchen, the general manager contacted me and invited me back for another meal. I took him up on the offer today and returned. Dominick greeted me and thanked me for coming back. We had a little chat and he made some recommendations before I ordered. This time, I got their turkey burger, which comes with avocado, alfalfa sprouts and tomato. Usually it comes with sweet potato fries, but Dominick recommended getting a salad instead, so I got the Truffle Israeli Couscous. Remembering how good the lemonade was, I also got a lemonade. 

The turkey burger was delicious! Honestly, way better than the regular burger. And I'm glad he recommended getting a salad - the couscous salad was amazing. I wish I hadn't eaten it all so I could have saved more for a snack later in the day. The lemonade was just as good as I remember it too. Win!

The staff was extremely friendly again. Not just the general manager, but also people working the counter. They were extremely friendly and helpful. 

I'm really glad I gave Daily Kitchen another chance. It deserves it! I'm definitely looking forward to trying more of their salads and other tasty menu options."}
{"text":"What a deliciously, awesome, healthy spot to grab some lunch! I had been eyeing this place for awhile, but could never commit because I was CONVINCED that everything would be super overpriced for the amount of food I would be given. Well, I was wrong! The prices are totally reasonable and the food is not only healthy, but very good. 

I got the turkey & avocado wrap and it was a solid choice for sure. The gentlemen who was working was SUPER helpful and explained many of the menu items to me as well as his favorites. He also mentioned that I was welcome to sample any of the items from the \"salad bar\" and a few of the \"everyday entrees\" that were pre cooked such as the meatballs and chicken tinga. Although these few items are already made, all of their other items are made to order, which is a testament to the freshness of the meals! 

After enjoying my wrap I HAD to try the Dragon Bowl and let me tell you. . .delicious. I'm not a huge fan of granola OR coconut, which are both ingredients in the Dragon Bowl, but that was not even an issue. The pitaya was so cold and sweet that all of the fruit and other toppings on it just paired so beautifully!

As for the star of the meal. . .my drink. To put it simply, the Rosemary Vanilla Lemonade might have changed my life. Ok, it did. The dang lemonade changed my life. If you're not convinced you need to visit this place for the great, healthy food, trust me when I tell you the lemonade is worth it."}
{"text":"My sweet potato fries came out cold/Luke-cold, and my Acai bowl came 1/4 melted.. This place is mediocre. I've had better Acai bowls.. They need to make them a lot thicker.. But the fries are pretty good. Lots of organic options. Might be back.."}

{"text":"I am definitely not the healthiest eater, but Daily Kitchen makes it very easy! Delicious, fresh, healthy food and excellent service were found during our visit. It was so good we came back two days in a row. 

On our first visit I ordered the southwestern chicken bowl. Spring mix lettuce with organic chicken, black beans, guac and tortilla strips topped with a delicious citrus vinaigrette. My other half had the market salad bar. You can pick three salads for $8 and add a protein for only $3 more. He chose the roasted cauliflower, California and israeli couscous with truffle oil. The California salad had tomato, cucumber and big chunks of avocado. Everything was fresh and healthy and tasted great. 

We came back the next day around 10:45. None of the salads were out yet since they didn't start serving lunch until 11:00. We were just getting ready to sit down and wait 15 minutes when the manager, Fuchsia, came out. She said the salads were made and she would be happy to bring them all out early so we didn't have to wait. Great service that will keep bringing us back. She was so friendly and happy we were new customers. 

This time I also had the market salad bar picking the couscous, California and asian noodle salad. I also added a turkey chili on top of quinoa for only $3. The turkey chili was excellent! It was actually a complete second meal on its own. Mixed with the quinoa the flavorful chili was filling but healthy delicious. 

You absolutely must try the organic vanilla lavender lemonade. Yes, its as good as it sounds! DK also has a full juice bar and all natural sodas and juices."}

{"text":"Came by here during a long lunch break last week. I was super excited about the prospect of a place for fresh, healthy food! 

The service: the employees were friendly and quick. I sat out on the patio, and several people came by to check on us, clear plates, and make sure we were doing ok. A lot of times when you are sitting outside at quick service restaurants you end up getting forgotten about, but they did a good job keeping an eye out for us.

The food: the acai bowl was really yummy, if a little expensive. The only problem was the cold made the honey pretty solid, but I suppose that can't be helped. The chips and guac - the guac itself was decent, but the chips were awful. I don't know if they were stale or if that's just the style, but they required a LOT of chewing. 

The ambiance: come and enjoy the patio before it becomes too d**n hot to do so!"}
{"text":"I love the harmony juice from this place. Today we tried the dragon bowl for the first time and it is delicious, will continue to come back."}
