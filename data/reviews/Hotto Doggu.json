{"text":"Recently tried this place out for lunch and enjoyed it! It's a tiny place so if you plan on grabbing a table, you'll have to go before the lunch rush. I tried their curly fries and their okonomiyaki which were both tasty! I also gave their homemade mango green tea a try (they offer different flavours monthly if I recall correctly), but if you want their tea you need to ask for it as it's not displayed on their menu above the cash. The portions are a bit small for the price which is why I am only giving this spot 4 stars, but otherwise the staff is friendly and the place is cute."}
{"text":"I came with my friend for lunch and we ordered some appetizers and one hot-dog to share. Since they just opened, they didn't have everything from the menu yet and service was a bit slow.   It is a cute concept of adding Japanese toppings in hot-dogs but it is not something that I would be craving for because otherwise it is just a regular hot-dog.   The fried potatoes chips are good. The other appetizers are not bad either. They can add some more flavors to the karaage though. Finally, I find the jasmine tea a bit too sweet.   Will give it another chance."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on the grand opening. It's a fairly small place, but bright and clean. A nice casual atmosphere.   I ordered the lobster hot dog combo. The hot dog itself while not exceptional was still quite good. The small spiral potato that came with the combo was delicious!  The menu is varied enough and includes staple Japanese dishes like okonomiyaki and takoyaki, so I'll definitely be back to try other items on their menu!  The service was a little on the slow side, but understandable given the lineup and it being the grand opening.  I was surprised to see everyone's order, including those who ate in the restaurant, being handed out inside paper bags. Seems rather wasteful.  Still, for what it is it's a cool new spot to enjoy hot dogs with a Japanese twist!"}
{"text":"Original food ! Nice staff explaining all choices ! If you don't know what to choose ask them .  I Really enjoyed my food and will go back . It opened few months ago and it is well located"}
{"text":"It's about time Japanese style hot dogs come to this city !   This place reminds me of Japadog in Vancouver... Today I tried the Terimayo hotdog (sausage w/ shredded carrots, red onions, fried onions, Japanese mayo, teriyaki sauce, nori) and Okonomiyaki hotdog (okonomiyaki, teriyaki, mayo, bonito flakes). Both hot dogs were very flavourful and quite filling. Although they're very overwhelming to look at, the toppings were light and all the ingredients intermingled well with each other. The service was quite fast and the place was pretty clean as well."}
{"text":"I've heard from Vancouverites about the legendary Japadog.  I have no basis for comparison, but this was pretty darn good!  I tried the Terimayo and it basically tasted like if I took my favorite sushi toppings and dropped it on a hotdog.  Which sounds bad in writing but it's actually quite tasty and unlike a lot of loaded food truck doggos I've had in the past, it didn't leave me feeling greasy and tired in its wake.  The trio also came with some nice shoestring house fries with Japanese mayo on top.  The trio with the drink was just under $10, not bad for a filling downtown meal!"}
{"text":"Karaage for days! New hot spot that opened last week and you know I had to try it. The 2 I wanted to try was unavailable, so I settled for the Karaage one. Karaage was very good, slightly spicy, which I love. Bread was soft and very fluffy. They also had BaGa \"Burgers\" which looked very good as well, consist of seaweed and rice + toppings. They have decent amount of choices throughout their menu (Not too much for you to get overwhelmed but enough at the same time, know what I mean haha), they also had salad bowls which also looked delicious. So yeah, wish I could of tried more stuff. This cost me 15,50$ for both things. Absolutely loved the decor."}
{"text":"Idéal pour un snack. Très bon rapport qualité / prix. Service est sympa, plutôt cool. Il y a un large choix, allant du hot dog au burger. C'est original et bon. Je pense y retourner pour essayer autre chose."}
{"text":"Came in today on their grand opening. The line wasn't too bad by 12:30 and we ordered a terimayo combo. I am going to update this review in about 15 minutes when this food gets in my belly!! Looking forward to it!!  Fast forward 30 minutes later, we get our food finally. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. The fries were too soggy and the hot dog lacked sauce and condiments. It was quite sad.   Service was also extremely slow. Hopefully they continue to improve in the days to come."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try out Japanese hot dogs and was excited to hear that it finally arrived in Montreal!   I finally tried it out with a friend for lunch, and luckily it was not busy when we got there. We ordered the Kaarage hot dog combo, which doesn't come with a wiener but the fried chicken, and their takoyaki. The food was brought to us pretty quick, about 5mins after we took our seats after ordering. The karaage hot dog was good, however, the pieces of chicken were a little small so it felt like there was more bun than meat. I would have also loved it more if their buns were toasted or warm though! As for their potato side, homemade potato chips with toppings, and their takoyaki, they tasted pretty good!   Although I wasn't too impressed with their karaage hot dog, I would definitely come back and try their other menu items (actual hot dogs and sushi burgers)! Their prices were not cheap (the karaage hot dog combo came up to ~14$), but is still worth it depending on what you get."}
{"text":"This small restaurant is pretty trendy these days. I always want to try the potato spiral.  We had two hotdogs, one as in combo, a potato spiral and octopus balls.  I think the hotdogs are ok. My husband prefered his fried chicken one. Mine was no 1 which has little surprise. The fries was very thin but not crispy enough. I think if it was more freshly made it can be more crispy. The octopus balls were a little saggy but taste good.  It is a nice little place to rest the feet after visiting the place d'art."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal. Stumbled upon this place while wandering around. Very unique and delicious!!"}
{"text":"I was curious about this place since it opened up near where I used to work, and now I've been here a couple of times I have to say, I'm not sure if it's worth it.  The hot dogs and potato sides are exciting and gimmicky, with spiral potatoes (like the ones you've seen on Instagram!!!! wow!!!) and hot dogs with about a thousand toppings, all for QUITE A LOT MORE than a hot dog normally sells for.   I had a hot dog with avocado and tobiko, a spiral potato with garlic, and then accidentally more fries (if you can call them that, they're more like spud shavings, which sounds far worse than it tastes - they're quite nice, though they go cold quickly). The waitress asked if I wanted to make it a combo, and I thought that included the spiral potato! Nope!  Avocado + hot dog is not a great texture combination - it's too cold, soft and wet to be a great accompaniment to a frankfurter. The tobiko was generously portioned, but that meant it was incredibly difficult to eat - the antithesis of hot doggery.   The spiral potato was lovely: very garlicky, fun to eat, but it's thinness cooled it off fast and soon it was a slightly soggy tater :(  Also they didn't seem to have...regular Coke? They just had all those weird flavoured ones like mango and ginger. I had the ginger one. It was unimpressive, but whatever, that's Coke's fault.   I'm not sure how worth the cost is. Was it fun? Yeah! It was also $20! So! That's a lot!   Up to you, really. If you want an expensive ~experience~ go for it!"}
{"text":"Had a mini stay in Montreal this past Victoria Day long weekend, and decided to stroll down Sainte-Catherine.  I don't usually pay too much mind to stores when I'm not looking for anything in particular, but the takoyaki picture in the window caught my eye and it looked DELICIOUS.   We chose to have the sushi burger (not quite sure what the actual name for it was, they were labeled as (type) B2 etc).   My boyfriend had gotten the tenpura? I believe is what it was called, and I got the unagi burger. We had already eaten so we decided to take it to go for our drive back to Toronto (otherwise I would've gotten an amazing photo of it :( )  Stuck in traffic, we decided to give them a try, and WOW was I ever impressed.  There was just the right amount of flavor from sauce to rice to everything!  We were super mad we hadn't thought about grabbing two each, had we known they'd be that good.  The place is adorable, limited seating, but I don't see this place as a place where someone would sit for hours on end, so I wouldn't be concerned about grabbing a seat.   Definitely give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We tried this new hotdog restaurant on Saturday, it's delicious and never saw it before in Montréal. I love so much that traditional restaurant to have a creative mind, that is significant in 21 century and make this new brand to success! Love it !!!"}
