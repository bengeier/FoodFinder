{"text":"Super nice staff! It was somewhat quiet while we were there about 5:30 on a Fri. They did have people in doing Story Telling which was a little entertaining,cute. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad, was good. My husband had the fish and chips, which I tried and it was also good. If you want a casual, no fuse place to kick back and have a few drinks with decent food then this is a great place to go! Decent prices.  I have to change my review of this place. We ate here a second time and it was really slow service even though the place was empty and the food was bad. Frozen and microwaved! no seasoning. Staff were indifferent."}
{"text":"Food was a major disappointment. We ordered an appetizer and had the enjoyment of watching other people's food go back to the kitchen. By the time the appetizer made it to our table we knew we had picked a bad one. We weren't going to let dinner get ruined."}
{"text":"Food was ordinary and typical burger and steak type found in every other small pub serviced by the same Gordon Food Service type purveyors.  No craft beer.  Poor and small selection of tap beer.  Food was similar to Schwann's."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. Very beautiful place. I really wish the upstairs was open I would have loved to walk around. I I enjoyed walking through what part was open. Very beautiful inside and out."}
{"text":"Been here twice, both special occasions... it has amazing architecture that brings a bit of class/fanciness to your night.  They have some tvs by the bar but it's otherwise not the sports bar type of place, more a conversation type or even a great place for a night cap on the patio...  The food was not memorable but no complaints either for our group of 30."}
{"text":"Food = ? (stops serving 8:30 on a Sat... Really?) Price = 3 (cheap... but, all of Madison is pretty affordable) Experience = 3 (nice service... but, this place is so ugly old.  Not in a good way."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with just the right level of ambiance. Lively enough that you knew you were not in a funeral home. Quiet enough that you could have a conversation.   Dinner was VERY good and prices are VERY  reasonable. Quantity was more than satisfactory."}
{"text":"Just not good at all. We all ordered the prime rib and I ate just a little bit couldn't enjoy it at all. Couldn't cut through it. Nachos is an appetizer had hardly anything on it we asked for extra cheese and she brought some in a cup and said it would be a $0.75 charge. We asked about dessert and all she had to offer was a pumpkin roll. Waitress act like she was mad at something with us we're not sure. Not a fun experience at all. Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of friends before prom a few days ago and the food was delicious! The steak was one of the best I had ever had! Great atmousphere and location! Only complaint would be that the server spilled corn on my dress, but hey! Accidents happen!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate here last weekend. The food was decent but not great.  My boyfriend had steak and I had the Korean barbecue pork chops.  They were tough and not that good but his steak was delicious.  We were seated on the side and there were a bunch of people there yelling and having a good time which would have been fine but we hadn't seen each other in a couple of weeks and would have liked to have had a quieter place to eat.  We asked about being moved but it was a weekend and they were pretty crowded so there wasn't anywhere to go.  Bottom line the food was okay, the place was clean, and we enjoyed the history.  But it was expensive and not that great."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Disappointing as food is actually pretty good. Did speak with manager regarding quality of service, they did apologize and gave a gift certificate."}
{"text":"This was our second attempt at enjoying a meal here... service was slow and mediocre. Both times we have eaten here, someone didn't get their food and had to ask for it. We never received refills on our drinks. Food is wayyyy overpriced for the quality.  Nothing special..."}
{"text":"We stopped in about 2:30 on a Sunday. Ordered two beers, both glasses came with lipstick on them. We waited about 45 mins for nachos and a burger, it finally came out but it was wrong (asked for no cheese on the burger, it had cheese). Will not return!"}
{"text":"My husband and I always love the food here. Sometimes the service is slow but we do like the food and the environment. Tonight, our server was Lisa and she was very friendly and timely! She was a great waitress."}
{"text":"One of the few places in Madison that I can get a Bombay Sapphire martini! Pretty good menu. Environment a bit off but you came to eat right?"}
{"text":"When I saw this old HISTORICAL HOTEL I had to have an excuse to go inside...we had already eaten a spot of lunch...but I told my fellow travelers...come on...we will share an appetizer and grab a drink and then I can wonder around and enjoy...  The hotel was built in 1834, it is 180yrs old...can you believe it..??? It is gorgeous. The actual upstairs is closed right now..but the interior is very nice...  We were seated at the bar room in a deep booth towards the back. We opted to share 6 hot wings (.50 each special), a serving of their Hot Artichoke Spinach dip served with slices of warm french baguettes..Noel and I both chose sweet tea with lemon and limes and Tony went for $1.25 draft special of Bud Light Draft..our entire check was $14.09 with taxes...our waitress was so sweet...so I left a $20...she was so appreciative..and so sweet..  The hotel is very nice and for bar food...it was really good food. We enjoyed it quite a bit and would definitely eat here again...I highly recommend you check this restaurant bar out if you are in the area..On their website it states this is the OLDEST HOTEL and BAR in the entire state of Indiana..located two blocks back from the Ohio River...check them out!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sure the pretzel is good when it's hot or even warm, but mine was ice cold. Beer cheese was ok and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"I loved this place. A little intimidating from the outside with all the motorcycles parked there. So worth it on the inside. Not at all what you would expect. Staff was friendly. Food was good. Patrons were friendly also. We were there for lunch. Has seating outside on the patio also."}
{"text":"We popped into the Tavern very close to closing time on a Monday, hoping for a drink. That can be hard to pull off in a smaller down on a weekday, and we were pleasantly surprised that Broadway was not only willing to seat us but keep the kitchen open for us without a complaint. A few tables and the bar were still full when we arrived, and the space itself is cozy and historic, a great spot for an early nightcap.  We split a pretzel, just expecting bready something to fill our bellies. But I don't think it was just the whiskey and cider talking when it turned out the pretzel was perhaps the best pretzel I've ever had. It was enormous, crusty, soft, and hanging by its own special pretzel hanger, a tool I'd never actually seen before. It also game with some exceptional beer cheese to dip in.   It looks like a lot of folks have had less than positive experiences on Yelp, but we were definitely pleased with ours, and I'll be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My parents would take my friends and I here for dinner when they were in town.  Food was alright.  Nothing spectacular.  Cheap enough food but don't expect it to WOW you or anything.  Service was okay."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Okay food.  Our waitress forgot about us many times in favor of larger groups.  Can't say it wasn't a rational decision, but things generally seemed to be rather disorganized here."}
{"text":"Would not go here again! We we seated in the terrace which has a lovely view of a brick wall. Noise was easily carried in the room, so we could clearly hear the conversations of the two other couples in the room. There was a different waitress for each of the tables. We had our food brought to us by another because our waitress was busy in another room. We ordered the prime rib, medium, both of ours were well done. My husband's was 1/4 inch thick, while mine was partially 1:4 inch , partially 1/2 inch and even a chunk that was 1 inch thick, looks like a child carved it. I would never go here again. We thought it would be a great place for our anniversary dinner, HA!"}
{"text":"Had the prime rib. With potato and side salad. It was pretty good. Ive got no complaints. Friendly and prompt  service.    update. ordered shrimp cocktail. it was very good. i had parmesan crusted chops and wifey had a salad. we were very happy.  good flavor and well prepared. server was new but competent. seems like they have stepped it up!  to be continued."}
{"text":"The building itself is pretty cool and one with a little imagination can see travelers from days past stopping in for a bite. The food was as expected for the moderate prices on the menu with offerings from basic burger to a steak and limited seafood offerings. Beers are also moderately priced for most drafts (Amber Bock $2, Stella $5) and they even had some craft brews in the likes of Dogfish IPA and Quaff On/Big Woods. My service was a little lacking given the fact that we were some of the only people in there but It's probably hard working in Madison on a Thursday. Overall, the next time I'm in town I'd probably try some other place but wouldn't be disappointed to end up back at this establishment. I'd be more likely to frequent this place if I lived in the area but not really something special for a night out."}
{"text":"Came here because everything in Madison IN was closed on Sunday. Had dinner with friend Jim and Nancy and my girlfriend Toey. Ordered appetizer the Homemade Crab dip, it probably the only highlight on the menu. It was actually good. I ordered Korean pork chops, which I thought it's going to be a gourmet pork-shop, but it was a basic seasoned pork-chop, not a fan of it, little dry. Girlfriend order the fish tilapia, it was ok. I will probably won't make a special trip here, unless it's only place open on Sunday and I just ordered the crab dip."}
{"text":"What a warm and friendly bar! We arrived at 3pm and our bartender introduced herself and immediately told us about the specials.  She said if we were still there at 4pm, appetizers were half priced.  Somehow we managed to spend $40 on drinks and the addictive game machine.  By the time we left at 6:30pm, the place was packed.  The bar and restaurant were quaint and charming.  Had we not had dinner plans, I'm sure we would have had a nice dinner."}
{"text":"A very charming place...mostly plonk on the outdoor patio...which is very New Orleansish....good bands in an outstanding atmosphere.  Inside is very nice...and I have heard nothing but good \"local\" reviews from....locals.  Just wish some of these places would do better with craft beers !"}
{"text":"CLOSED as a hotel / bed & breakfast -- as of July 2013; they said they are not sure if / when it will be reopened as a hotel / bed & breakfast, but probably not in 2013."}
{"text":"Had a very delightful  experience last night on 6-13-18 eight of us as a church group had dinner we arrived at 6 our waitress or server whos name is Sheila took our drink orders and within a few minutes brought them out the place was very busy had two parties going on in the back Sheila came back and took our food orders it took a bit to receive our food like I said they were busy Sheila kept us informed on what was going on no problems the food came out probably 45 minutes which was fine the food was very good no complaints from no one I ordered the new York strip it was fantastic also I ordered onion rings the onion rings did not come from a bag pre made they looked to be hand made and were ever good over all we all had a very good dinning experience I would highly recommend Broadway We will be back"}
{"text":"An annual visit that will cease!  Menu has changed to a very limited selection. Tonight they had even less of a selection because they ran out of food!  In addition the side of chips with the sandwich was smashed. Mistakes on orders numerous. Talked to manager. Nada."}
{"text":"This historic place was impressive.  The waitress was very friendly and helped me decide on the special.  The special was prime rib with 2 sides and everything was very good.  They run out of specials sometimes so ask when you order.  I got the last prime rib of the evening.  She recommended their specialty cocktail of broadway punch to go with dinner.  I love specialty cocktails and this one was good enough to have more than one."}
{"text":"*  not a review but a heads up  *  2/25/10  I just called to get room rates and the rooms are getting a face lift and won't be opening back up until early/late September of this year.  :-)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is wonderful !!! I recommend The appetizer of home made potato chips with dip (cottage cheese mixed with ranch dressing)! Delish - sit at the bar- the table wait staff service is marginal to poor - we had to visit because of its historic status"}
{"text":"This was our first time in Madison, IN and we didn´t have a clue of where to go for dinner. A few places were closed this Sunday on Memorial Day Weekend, but Broadway Historic Hotel and Tavern were opened. And they had tables outside!! We got seated and very quickly handed menus and asked what we wanted to drink. We got good suggestions for which beers to go for, and both my husband and I were happy with that selection.   We arrived a bit before 6.30PM and ordered our food not many minutes after we sat down. We both ordered baby back ribs (half rack) since we sitting outside, could feel the smell from the bbq. After 10-15 minutes I got my slaw served. And even if it was indeed a nice slaw, I don´t get how come the slaw is being served separately from the food it was ordered together with. After another 30 minutes or so (almost an hour after we ordered the food) we finally got our food. Nothing fancy, but the food was nice. Ok, I would not recommend anyone to order the sweet potato fries, they were mushy and the skin was left on them which was not nice. But besides from that the rest was nice. My husband tried the \"german fries\" which was more like a \"potato salad\" with bell peppers and onion, really nice. And half rack was more than enough to fill us both.   The wait for the food was not scoring points. We were in no hurry, but it could perhaps have been nice to know when we ordered the food that it would take a bit until it was served. Now, being accustomed to service in the U.S. and that it´s always so quick, I had the feeling that they had forgotten us.   But all in all, food was good and prices were very (!!) reasonable. We enjoyed a proper dinner, we got to sit out and enjoy the lovely evening :-)"}
