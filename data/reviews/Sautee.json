{"text":"At 4:05 Buca de Beppo was closed (until 5 ) we went to Sautee.
Don't waste your time or money.
Food was good - not great. Service was sloooooooooooooooooow.
The \"Chefs\" circled our table like buzzards- the waitress was no where to be seen- until she popped over and with perky grin - your order is next ( 4:45) wondered if we could sneek out- but there were only 4 other peopled tables.( Came in after us)
I had Urban Chicken - ehhh okay- Lame Tex Mex offering - he had Tortellini and chicken ( that is it !-no breadstick no salad no crouton or even parsley) and some chef boyardee sauce.
Don't go - hold out until 5 for Boca!"}
{"text":"I was kind of surprised at Barry S's review of Sautee as my daughter and I have sort of made it a Friday afternoon staple.  But, we always go early (before 5), so if a waiter can't give us good service then, they are in trouble! LOL  But I digress.  My daughter (16) and I have been there 4 times now and the service has really been quite excellent. Maybe they read Barry's review and took it to heart....don't know.

OK...so about the food.  Have only had one appetizer, the flash fried calamari.  The calamari itself is great, big fat strips that were cooked perfectly. Probably the most tender calamari I have ever had. My problem with the dish is the dipping sauces. I can see having one conventional and one edgy sauce, but two edgy sauces is one too many.  The chipotle chili (their spelling) sauce was a little sweet and though hot, it didn't have that deep smoky flavor that I normally associate with chipotles.  The key lime red pepper sauce is just weird and doesn't work too well in my eyes. I'd like to see them offer a jalapeno tartar sauce or maybe a regular aioli instead of the key lime pepper sauce. 

The entrees we have had have all been sandwiches, but they were really quite good. The chipotle chili sauce burger which features smoked gouda and caramelized onions was good, but I would get the chili sauce on the side as it is quite sweet. The pan cheddar burger (pancetta, white cheddar) was also pretty good though the pancetta was very salty.  The standouts in my eyes were the two \"pressed\" (very panini-like) sandwiches.  The St. Peter's Press (Lightly battered Tilapia fillet on toasted Tuscan bread with roma tomatoes, baby spinach, Swiss cheese, jalapenos and a spicy lemon cream), and the Roast Beef  Press (roast beef on toasted Tuscan bread, with mayo & melted Swiss cheese. Served with Au Jus) were the standouts. The Grilled Chicken & Sun-dried Tomato Press (Sliced chicken served on toasted Tuscan bread with romaine, red onion, roma tomatoes, Gouda cheese and sun-dried tomato vinaigrette) was sort of a train wreck.  The chicken was cut into such small pieces that none of it stayed in the sandwich, and the vinaigrette was just...odd.   I would have preferred just a few drops of balsamic instead. 

One more note is about Sautee's side dishes, specifically their potatoes.  Sautee knows how to make potatoes.  The white cheddar bacon or the blue cheese mashed potatoes are highly recommended, but the french fries....man...they are the stuff that dreams are made of... :)  Lightly battered and cooked perfectly...they are just too good. 

I would be interested in seeing some reviews on the main entrees as I have yet to try one....."}
{"text":"Located in Fulton Ranch, a fairly new upscale shopping center including an AJ's, Sautee seemed to be trying too hard and in some cases not hard enough.

I stopped in for an impromptu lunch, even though I was still slightly full from breakfast.
Oh I hate it when i go somewhere new and everything sounds good and I don't know what to order, so I thought I'd try a few different things.

Pretty expensive entrees, up to $29.95! Moderately priced salads and sandwiches around the $10 range.

I decided to start with the Fried Calamari, soaked in buttermilk for maximum tenderness these thick and juicy strips were melt in your mouth bliss.(see pics) 
The accompaniment sauces however were not a good match, chipotle chile, tasted like spicy BBQ and the key lime red pepper was like a sweetened thinned out mayo, I didn't detect any lime flavor in there at all, I ended up asking for lemon wedges which were just what those babies needed, YUM!

I also ordered the Chicken Satay skewers served with spicy tangerine sauce, these were tasty and the sauce was perfect match(see pics)

The last thing I tried was one of their Fire Grilled Flat-breads, I chose the \"of the day\" flavor which was urban chicken, with spinach, mushroom and smoked gouda (see pics) 
Not impressed at all, I can guarantee this was not made to order, my toppings slid around under a thick blanket of dried cheese, meaning it was melted sometime before I ever ordered it. I only took two bites.

My waiter service was good, I was visited in total by 3 different waiters(?) all who asked how everything was and I expressed to each of them my dislike of the pizza. 

Unfortunately none of them offered to get me something else or remove it from my bill~which is the courteous standard at most restaurants~especially NEW ones.

The pizza was even boxed  up for me, why would I want to take home something I didn't like? I told him to toss it.

I'm not sure if I would come back here or not, maybe to try a salad, but I'm not going to chance spending $30 on entree that I might not like."}
{"text":"If you're on weight watchers or something like that, you should probably stay away, because everything on the menu is fattening, even the spinach salad that I thought I'd get away with being under a bazillion calories is drenched in dressing and topped with fried onions.  

So as long as you dont care how much your rear will grow while being there, I recommend the (cheese) enchilada soup and the (cheese) quesadilla, even though it's is pretty greasy, but it's okay, cause I think they use expensive grease, so it tastes really good.

They have a nice patio with a cool fire-thing and a beautiful view of the parking lot.  It is pretty pricey too and is really trying to look like a new vegas casino or scottsdale club.   oooh fire!  when does the pirate show start!"}
{"text":"Lets get the negative out of the way first...Sautee gets minus one star for serving the entrees way too soon after getting the appetizer.

Besides that, I loved it!  I went there last night to meet my friend and her husband for dinner.  They are new to Chandler and we were thinking of places to go and I mentioned this place since I always wanted to go.  

I walked in where on the right is the bar area.  There was live music from this guy who was just awesome.  The music wasn't too loud and I was still able to have a conversation with my friends.  Stacey was our server and she was patient and extremely knowledgeable  about the wines.  She recommended a bottle of Pinot Noir for us (though I was hesitate since I am not a red fan at all) and I am now a convert!  LOL, we ended up finishing two bottles. (I think I am still drunk)

We started off the night with the calamari for the appetizer.  The calamari itself was cooked perfectly, though I could have done with the sauces that were with it.  (A chipolte chili drizzle and a key lime red pepper sauce)  I ended ordering the Panko chicken with spinach, avocado and a side of fruit. (Trying to stay a little healthy)  It was amazing and cooked just right.  My friend had the Garlic Feta Shrimp Wrap that she said was great and her husband had the Tortellini...put it this way I never saw somebody finish a meal that quickly.  He loved it.

I loved the atmosphere was this place...upscale without the pretentiousness.  The company definitely help, of course. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Mesa really needs more fine, independent restaurants so I had high hopes for this place. It's architecture is modern inside and out and screams \"trendy hot spot\". 
The food was good, but not great. Service was where they really fell down, an upscale restaurant (which what this place gives the impression of being) should really put the patron first, make them feel they're somewhere special. But our service was Slooowww, our server bordered on down right rude, actually argued with my wife that her Ice tea wasn't flavored instead of just explaining that their tea has a unique taste and if it was unagreeable, offer her some other beverage. 
Maybe they could have been having a bad day, but unless I start reading from some other yelpers that they had a different experience, I'm crossing Sautee off our list..."}
{"text":"Dinner for four on a Friday at Sautee. Halibut and steak entrees were excellent. Our waitress was attentive. 

Problem: something went wrong in the design of this place. It is exceedingly LOUD, like the restaurants in New York City that want to turn tables quickly. Music and conversation left ears feeling like the same as when I walked out of the Judas Priest concert last week.

Unless you're in the mood to call audibles at the line to your waiter, pass on this one for dinner."}
